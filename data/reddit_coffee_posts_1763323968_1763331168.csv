I’ve been using a Cuisinart Custom Grind & Brew Single-Cup Coffee Maker, and no matter what I do, the coffee keeps coming out watery or weak-tasting. I’ve tried adjusting the grind size, using different beans, changing the amount of grounds, and even descaling the machine, but the flavor is still pretty thin.

Has anyone else experienced this with this specific model?
Any tips, settings, or fixes that helped you get a stronger cup?

The coffee beans I'm trying to brew should be fruity with medium acidity. I unfortunately don't know if it's a light/medium/dark roast as the seller did not specify that.

I am using Hario V60 01 dripper and Hario Mini Mill Slim grinder. I have tried grind sizes from 6 to 11 steps from ""0"" (the tightest setting I could get it to without applying a considerable amount of force) and the difference in taste was that it was unbearably bitter on the 6 setting and less, but still too bitter on the 11 setting and the fruity flavors were not really there. Also the grind size is a bit uneven (there were few in the order of 2-3 millimeters).

I tried following the James Hoffman V60 recipe (15g coffee, 45g bloom for 45 seconds and then 50g pours in 10 second intervals until 250g of water), and also blooming for 45 seconds and then slowly pouring the rest continuously. One weird thing is that my brew time is always a bit short (2:00 to 2:10 min). 

About water temperature, I'm using just a basic kettle, but I tried to insert a temperature probe and wait until the temperature reaches around 96 degrees C, this did not lead to a significant change. I also tried to pour the water as slowly as possible, but the flow rate was definitely not as consistent as it is with gooseneck type kettles. I'm trying to keep the kettle nozzle 2-3 centimeters above the coffee bed.

I hope that all this random info makes some sense, I'm just getting into pourover and I don't really know what I'm doing. Is there something I can try/experiment in a more methodological manner (preferably with the same equipment)?

Update to this post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/hUlFwDdUqM


As you may have already read, the mission was a failure, and I’m wondering how that’s even possible.

Let’s go back to the beginning. We were on the metro, alone, and during a quiet moment I asked her if we could grab a coffee one morning, adding that she had offered me a bunch of things before and I wanted to return the favor.
At first she seemed a bit stunned and said: “Uhh yeah okay… sorry, I was looking over there because there was a girl” (there was literally nobody), “but yeah, very gladly!”
She gives me her phone, I write my number in it, and she tells me to text her so we could arrange it.

I was over the moon, because she always seemed way out of my league.
Then 2–3 days go by without seeing each other because of missing professors and stuff… and after class I text her to organize the coffee.

And she replies: “Okay, maybe we can invite the others too.”

That hurt, I admit it.
I write back like: “Look, I meant the coffee, don’t you remember? do you want to invite the others?”

She goes: “Yeah come onnn.”

And to avoid looking desperate I say okay, that it could be fine. She adds a “yess perfect”, but I’m pretty sure this hangout will never happen.

If you read the previous post, you know she really seemed interested. So now I don’t understand: did I misread everything? Is she shy? Taking things slowly? Or did she soft-friendzone me?

I don’t know how to act now. Any advice?",1,1763330872.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1oyyi52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oyyi52/leaving_a_job_without_another_lined_up_im_a/,Leaving a job without another lined up (I’m a manager). Job gives me anxiety attacks.,"At my current job, I am a full-time salaried Graphic Designer and Social Media Manager at a startup. Started PT in college, I graduated and have been working there for over a year now as a one-person creative (photography, marketing, design, illustration, etc) for essentially three businesses in one. I also am a food runner, barista, front desk person, and café manager. 

It’s a very ambitious project and run by three 24 year olds funded by their dads. I loved this job. Every day was dynamic. I was cross trained as a barista, food runner, and front desk person so it fed my ADHD, kept me happy, productive, and working for people I genuinely love and want to see thrive. Yes I had multiple hats and often it felt overwhelming and impossible to get my work done, but I also knew I thrived in chaotic environments so it worked. I’ve made so many memories, connections, and felt successful as someone trusted and valued, not just as a worker but as a friend. 

So here’s the bad: because the site is on a historical building, to build their business, they had to get rid of a beloved part of the city. Marketing was burning me out because I knew that half the city hated us for it — for example my illustrated chalkboard street sign gets regularly spat on by the same runner. I had to clean it off the other day and it was dehumanizing. 

To add to that, I regularly get slammed with tasks. There is not much of a structured “task list” just managers giving me them verbally, and sometimes they want urgent tasks done by EOD. I’m always overwhelmed.

Here’s the kicker: recently we had staffing changes. Before, we had a café manager who got fired due to some issues, and our new general manager, who I’ll call Dan, talked with me and asked me to step up as café manager. I wanted our old one gone (he was harassing me) so I said yes. I had to work the front desk, check people in, make coffee, serve food, AND do all my design stuff while standing at the desk. It was stressful but I knew I’d said yes already and I got a raise so I couldn’t complain. They still expected me to get work done. 

Dan hired a new barista to help me have time to design and now I’m back at my desk but still managing the café behind the scenes. He is aware I’m overwhelmed and is trying to reduce my stress by giving Manager 1 the only freedom to give me tasks, but it didn’t really work or help. 

Also Dan is a belligerent asshole. Everyone now seems stressed, dejected, and frustrated. I thought I was the only one but our chef is close to quitting too. He expects perfection and if you make a mistake, he will curse, get angry, single you out, embarrass you, give you silent treatment, etc. He is respected because he has helped our business grow and clearly knows what he’s doing, but the way he talks to me is condescending and causing me to go into anxiety attacks at work. I took two sick days which is unlike me — before I was a workaholic, now I can barely get through the day without crying. I wish I wasn’t so sensitive, but walking on eggshells at work ON TOP OF everything else? Not it.

I can’t sleep at night. I basically relapsed after a year clean no SH. 

I know I’m done, but I don’t know if I can do 2 weeks. I’m terrified of not being able to find another job for months, and sinking into worse depression. If I resign at all I’m fucking them over — I carry this business in so many ways but I’m so done. 

I’m embarrassed to be quitting. I pride myself on being a resilient person, able to adapt to keep myself employed in such a bad market, but truly, I don’t think I can accept that kind of treatment after so much effort and time building this business.",1,1763330404.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Don’t worry, I’m not about to get all goopy again. But I did take advantage of having a new, government phone with a number and, whose number would have yet to have been blocked by a family member. I sent a text to my older brother, Andy, today. He and I have had some substantial differences of opinion these last few years, but I wanted to thank the man for what he has done along with the money he has spent in those efforts. I led that text off by thanking him for, I believe, bailing me out of jail after the Walmart fiasco. He didn’t mention that bail in his kind reply, and I wouldn’t be surprised if his hard head might accept credit for it, if he deserves none. Suppose he hadn’t been that bailer. I think he was, and nobody has admitted it was them. But somebody out there did, so I’ll consider them thanked now.

Two or three months ago, half my inclination to make this post could have been aimed at getting under my sister Paige’s (Sugarbelle’s) skin. This one is not. Of course, that little Stygian does leap right to the front of my mind when I consider having made something of an amends with a family member, but that is what normal people are supposed to be able to do. On a couple of other major fronts for me, I have tried a little more than usual to repair, somewhat, the relationship that I have with both my son and father. I hate to give Sugarbelle any kind of thrill, but I’ve not received much of a response from those efforts. I tend to doubt that my father believed some of the things he was probably hearing about me, which does carry a little more relief for me, because the old man has a shorter time to spend in this world. 

My son, Jake (Thunderfoot), is different. He took a little offense, when the family turmoil ensued, to me saying that he might have been too young at the time to recognize what I was up against. Of course, I was giving him a lot of reasons to be offended at the time, some of which were valid and some not. Not too many of those offenses stay in my head these days, but the offense he took to my believing he might still be a little too young to deal with that situation has remained at the forefront of my mind. My good sister pointed out to me today that a kid in their early 20s is, in some ways, no different than how most of us felt as we all approached legal adulthood. I had my Peugeot and was a bad man with a pretty good income. I wasn’t going to listen to too much about that time, which was through those dysfunctional Dennis Nearing years. I had some big head-butts at home during that time, but never with Dennis because he was too much of a chicken. I’ll give you an example of that cowardice:

1302 Winchester Apartments, Smyrna, GA. I was going through my normal after-work ritual of sitting in my room and getting baked. I was high, but my TV in there was different, which didn’t concern me. Some minutes went by before there was a knock on my bedroom door. I had the windows open and the fan on, so I wasn’t concerned when I opened the door to see my stepfather, Dennis, there. He explained the TV, and I began replying when, out of nowhere, smoke started pouring out of my damned mouth. I have experienced that phenomenon 3 or 4 times since, but had never done so at that point. Dennis’s head went back and he noticeably blinked his eyes through the smoke. “Okay”, he said, “I just wanted to let you know about the TV”. That was it. That smoke probably smelled like marijuana, but I was obviously smoking something in my room. I expected to at least hear something about it from my mother the next day, but he was obviously too big of a pussy to even tell her.

I haven’t brought Dennis up in many, if any, of my earlier posts. There is a good reason for that. He was never much to even talk about. That thought leads me right back to Sugarbelle, who actually was usually too young to remember a lot of the things that Courtney and I remember too well. On that note, I will end this with a direct shot at little Paige. This paragraph was for you, Sugarbelle. 

But I’ll leave on a good note. I might end too many posts with a link to some Talking Heads, but I rarely go back to their first LP. In my TH music hunts, I always find myself looking for a tune that uses one of my favorite instruments of all time, the xylophone. When I began imagining today’s post, an old Heads song popped into my head as possibly a title for this post. This song had always been one of my favorites, but one of the few that I liked from the ‘77 LP. I chose the title of this post very well, especially after listening to the words of this beauty:

1oyyf3i,https://i.redd.it/vcjs78nzxo1g1.jpeg,Highs and lows,"There are so many days I wish I could just find some stability. Instead, my life tends to be a yo-yo.  There are days I step out of the shower feeling grateful for the person I am turning into,  liking the person staring back at me.  There are just as many days when I wake up in a deep state of depression that neither the coffee or the shower chases away.   Days when that woman I am trying to become is nowhere to be found , days when the only thing to be found in that mirror is a hideous fool of a man.  Days when everything I gave up in pursuit of something I'm most clearly not seems like such a tragic waste.  

I'm starting to get to the point I can recognize some of the patterns to these ebs and flows.  The way that any memory of her tends to send me into a deep spiral of depression.  The way that depression causes this deep sense of fatigue and makes the rest of the day worse. The way that exercise is the only medicine I've found that truly works on depression.  The paradox that it is often so difficult to go and do the one thing you know will help when you're at the bottom of the latest trough.   

I've spent much of this fall working with a therapist trying to get past the constant heartache that came with my fiance's departure.  It's been more than 4 years since she decided that our relationship was officially over, you think I would have moved on by now. I haven't, but I'm also aware that I can't really afford to let let the mourning over the loss of that relationship completely suck away my ability to experience joy in life. 

To be honest, it's fairly questionable whether that therapy has actually produced any positive results.  Sure, it's been nice to have somebody to talk to about some of this and I was fortunate to be able to find a counselor who was at least trans friendly.  But the truth is that many of the downward spirals of the last several months have been rooted in the homework assignments I had been given in the name of trying to get over things.  The last, a handwritten letter apologizing for all those things that I wished I could tell her I was sorry for had left me feeling completely drained.  It still sits on my desk,  five pages of cursive.,  All the things I wish I had said, all the things I wish I hadn't.   The understandings I have slowly gained of what it must have felt like for her to be on the other end of that those conversations.  The understanding that her decision to leave me wasn't solely because I was trans, but was also rooted inthe fact that there had been plenty of other areas where we had struggled, and I simply didn't give her enough to hold on to,  to give her enough to make her think that it could still be worthwhile to stay in a relationship even if I did transition.  

 As for what to do with that letter,  I don't have a clue.  I suppose it'll just sit there on my desk.   It's been years since I've heard from her,  I suspect she has decided to implement a no contact rule with me, l  If that is her wish, what right do I have to interfere with her life and peace now .It's something that's certainly understandable, something that I know that the therapist she had worked with when I had come out to her was a big proponent of.   All the same, it was something that deeply hurt to be on the receiving end of,  especially when I knew the way she had remained friends with her previous exes when we had been together.   Instead, all I'm left with is regrets that don't fade with time, wounds that don't heal,  the wish that somehow I could go back and do those conversations again armed with what I know now.  The knowledge that in a world where nearly every business here likes to play country music, there will probably always be a long list of songs that are capable of completely gutting me, leaving me struggling for my composure in a public setting. 

Those questions of ""could we have made it if""....... never really go away.  Recently, I came across a study that suggested that nearly 40% of marriages where one spouse comes out as transgender survive.  The figure seemed really high to me.  I had assumed it to be in the single digits, assume that cracking your egg meant that you would be forced to make the hard choice between pursuing transition or staying married.  And yet, I've been surprised by the number of people who've replied to my posts over time who were able to keep the relationships together.  Nearly all those stories came with their own hard moments, nearly all of them required a huge amounts of work.   Yet simply knowing that something is even possible often has such an integral role in whether we put it forth effort into something in the first place.  Whether we seek out the wisdom that it takes to actually be able to do so.   Last night as I made my way home from the fields, I listened to the story of a woman who had chosen to stay with her partner through their transition. There is part of me that asked why couldn't I have found this one when I cracked my egg. There was another part of me that was simply thankful that it was out there, hoping that it would be useful for somebody else before they dealt with the longing and regret I deal with on a daily basis.

I don't know what to do with all of this.  I guess I'll keep on doing what I've always done, putting one foot in front of the other,  keep hoping that someday I'll find peace with myself, that someday I will find peace with the costs that have come with the choices I've made.  I've eventually come to a point, where I realize I don't regret transitioning, only that I wasn't able to keep my partner through it, wasn't able to keep the dreams that came along with that relationship.   I can miss her, miss everything we had hoped for and still have the feeling that this is me, even if I had to pay a horrible price for that.  I've come to the point that I've realized that I don't want to forget her, don't want to forget that relationship and love that we had, don't want to forget how amazing and wonderful she was.    Honestly, I don't want to quit loving her.   I hope that with time I can figure out a way to honor that memory without letting the regrets drag me so far down into the pits of despair.  I suppose I will  learn to carry that burden just the way you carry every other burden,  one day at a time, choosing each morning to slip the straps over your shoulders,  making your way onto your feet and then moving out.   In the meantime, I'm going to continue to hope and pray that those who follow behind me will be able to find more wisdom and strength in navigating these conflicts than I had.  I'm going to continue to hope and pray that for those who didn't do any better of a job than I did will be able to find peace and grace as well.    Best wishes, sretan put

“Trump is going to make Americans pay more for coffee, hamburgers and housing, not to get a better deal for U.S. workers or families, but to pressure Brazil to let their corrupt former president off the hook…this is a brazenly illegal effort by Donald Trump to sacrifice the economy to settle his own personal scores, and it is far outside his legal authority.”

Beginner here! Training for my first half marathon. I’m noticing after most of my longer runs (6+ miles) I’m getting intestinal cramping afterwards for a couple hours :( 

I think my pre-run nutrition is pretty OK. Usually have a bagel, coffee in the morning, and then a Gatorade before my run. Then lunch an hour or so after I get back. After that is usually when the cramping starts. I’m usually feeling better by dinner time, but it’s a real bummer.

Am I the only one like this?,"I believe I don't need friends but I really could see a benefit from having a best friend who gets it if you get it please contact me (  teenagers don't bother me please) + I'm from Benghazi 

People get shocked when I say I don’t have friends. I’m not the silent, shy type—I’m loud AF 😭. I just don’t consider anyone around me an actual friend. I don't hangout with people I don't attend social gatherings.
I’m super talkative (ADHD vibes), and honestly a very memorable person everywhere I go—mostly because I embarrass myself, and I’ve accepted that I’m socially awkward. But a big part of it is because I talk a lot and I stand up for myself. I’m peaceful unless someone attacks me in any way 😇. I’d say I’m a genuinely nice, loving person. I work with people every day, I treat them with respect, and I’ve even given lectures in front of thousands of people. Most people don’t hate me. So it’s not social anxiety or antisocial personality—I could literally sing in the middle of the street and not care. Trust me 😭

I’m probably somewhere on the autism spectrum, though.

The real issue is that I don’t connect with the culture or the personalities around me. I find most people ignorant and superficial. They all like the same things, copy-pasted, like sheep. I’m extremely independent and open-minded, and I refuse to change my personality just to fit in. I don’t “fit” into things I don’t genuinely enjoy. I hate small talk.
I hate how fake people can be—how many of them avoid honesty, sugarcoat things, or lie instead of being direct. If you don’t want to hang out, just say you don’t want to. Don’t make excuses. It’s fine.

I don’t relate to what most Libyans do or talk about.
I hate coffee shops.
I hate video games.
I hate soccer so much.
I have zero interest in cars.
I hate events and ceremonies 
I hate talking about people’s business.
I don’t care about local politics.

I don’t like going out unless it’s with someone I genuinely click with—or I go alone when I want a new experience, which isn’t often. I don’t like crowded, loud places, and I hate cigarette smoke.

My ideal social activity besides traveling abroad is sitting on a couch, talking with someone about movies, philosophy, the state of the world, mental health, psychology while eating at home something I cooked or delivery or singing karaoke.
Besides that I don't enjoy big groups ",2,1763330112.0,Libya,2,1.0,False

My partner and I moved to Westboro back in June, and while we absolutely love the area, I’m realizing I don’t actually know many people here.

I’m 32, female, married, work remotely (so the built-in socializing is basically gone), and I’ve been trying to find local social clubs… but most seem geared toward women 50+.

We’ve got a great group of friends, just none who live nearby, so I thought I’d check in here. Does anyone know of any social groups in Westboro/Hintonburg for women in their late 20s-30s/40s? Or… would anyone be interested in starting something casual?

Thinking things like meeting at a local café, trying local restaurants, climbing meetups, etc. Nothing intense, just a friendly way to meet more people my age. The women I socialize at the gym/Pilates are all retired and I'm not quite there yet! 

A bit about me!

• Two dogs
• Pretty active: running, bouldering, pilates, gym. 
• Love board games, good food, and cozy coffee shops

I have a best friend, we've been friends since junior high. We're like sisters and my family loves her. My mother treated her like her own daughter, she would cook for her when she requested her favorite dish, she would invite her in our family gathering, she would ask her to visit every Christmas to give her aguinaldo, she would do everything a mother would do for her daughter.

As my bestfriend of more than a decade, I thought I knew her. She was my safe space, She knew everything about me. My heartaches, my secret, my struggles. She was there when no one else was. She was my day one. Even in my lowest, she never left me. We knew each other to the bones. To make it short she's like me just in another body. That's how much I knew her, or so I thought.

So, these past few months my mother keeps missing money. The first time she noticed, she straight up asked me if I took money from her wallet. My sensitive ass got hurt and told her no, and that why everytime something got missing I was always the one she blames.  Then, the second time, she told me that 7k is missing from her wallet. I told her to just put Cctv so we can see whoever is stealing money from her because it's hard to point fingers especially if you don't have a proof. But since all us were busy doing our own stuff, the cctv thing was forgotten. The third time was when she went home early and asked if she could speak to me. We went to her room to talk in private. The moment we sat down, she immediately asked me how I could steal from her. I was so hurt and confused, I told her I never had steal from her and never will. She told me money had gone missing from her wallet again, and that I'm the only one who has access to her room and that everytime I'm in the house is the time when her money had gone missing. I tried to defend myself telling her to check on my things to see if I have it but she ignored it. She was CONVINCED that I was the one stealing from her. I was hurt but couldn't blame her because if I was her I would think the same thing. After our conversation, I left the house and went to my boyfriends house. I stayed for a couple of days thinking that at some point my mother will have her mmoney stolen again by the person whose been stealing from her since IT WASN'T ME and that maybe then she will realize. But to my surprise, nothing was stolen eversince I left home. I was so mad because I don't know how to convince them that I wasn't me.

So weeks go by, I had plans with my best friend, we had coffee and visited our other friend. When I got home, I came across my mother, she looks so mad and has teary eyes. She asked where's my bestfriend and wanted to speak with her. I immediately sensed that something was wrong so I asked her why. She told me that money had gone missing again and when she asked my niece who entered her room, my niece said my best friend's name. I was confused and in denial. I told her my best friend would never do that. My mom told me when that when my niece told her about my best friend going inside her room, she started to realize that every time her money was stolen, my best friend was always in the house with me. And when I asked more details about the incident earlier that day, I didn't know how to feel about it. Everything made sense. I started to have doubt on my best friend but I still told my mother that my best friend could neverrrr. After that night my mother finally decided to put CCTV.

And a month later came the worst day of my life. My best friend came to our house because we had dinner planned. When she went to my room I was still asleep. She woke me up and asked me to take a bath already so we can meet with our friends early. When I went downstairs, she followed me saying she'll grab some water. When I entered the bathroom, my brain immediately said ""THIS IS DE JAVU"" that moment was the exact same moment that happened when my mother told me that her money had gone missing and the one person that entered her room was my best friend. I felt nervous but brushed it off. Just minutes after,my brother knocked on the door of the bathroom and told me that he's going to speak to my best friend I asked him why and he showed me the cctv footage. I WAS SHOCKED. IT WAS HER ALL ALONG.

I didn't know what to do. When she was confronted by my brother she denied everything even when he showed her the footage. I tried to back her up as I didn't want her to feel that she was being ganged up on. And also in that moment I was still in denial. She kept denying it, telling us different narrative, and that the only reason she was in the room was because she was looking for my niece. But it was clear on the footage that she was rummaging through my mother's drawer where she sashes her money and her valuable stuff.

When she went home I tried to watch the footage again,trying to convince myself that maybe everything was just a misunderstanding, I watched it multiple times and ended up just feeling empty.

All this time, it was her. What's strange is I'm not mad at all. Now all I feel is sadness. I started to doubt everything we Had. Every time I opened up to her and she was comforting me, acted concerned, stayed by my side. None of that was real. I love her and I trust her so much to the point that my brain automatically filtered out the possibility. My family especially my mother also feel the same way. She wasn't mad, just sad and disappointed, after all, for her, she was her daughter too.

I don't know if I can lose her. She's my BEST FRIEND. I'm incomplete without her. I don't know what to do. She never reached out to me ever since she only reached out to our other friend trying to cover up her lies.

Should I just cut her off or should I talk to her and give her a chance to explain? If it were only for me I could forgive her, but it still hurts knowing that she also deceived my mother.",1,1763329769.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False

I'll share the back story but apologies if it's a bit long winded.

So a few months ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 or so years. Days (perhaps a week) after I broke up with my girlfriend, I received a follow request on Instagram by a woman. She had told me that she saw me at work (she's police, I'm a firefighter) and decided to add me. She messaged me first and we got to talking, trivial conversations about our pets at first, then work etc, then it evolved into flirting via DMs. We decide to meet up for coffee and it went really well, we both expressed how much we like each other. A week later, we meet up again, same kind of vibes. She had told me that she'd been single for 2 years and is happy in her life, which I'm in the same mindset (I enjoy my own company, which is why splitting up with my ex didn't bother me too much).

Now please note that I was in no way shape or form looking for another relationship or rebound so soon after my previous one. I went on this date as more of a curiosity, which ultimately, ended up biting me hard!

A few days after our second date, she messaged me while out with her friends saying that we should see each other again, to which I agreed. The agreed date came closer and she postponed due to illness, which was understandable, so we agreed on a different date. That one came, once again, she postponed. Another date agreed, but this time I had to postpone due to a training course at work. Then a day after this, I received a message saying that she doesn't see it progressing to being more than friends. I totally get this because I have been friend zoned multiple times and I also have friend zoned women in turn. I'm a 'pick my self off the ground and brush my shoulders off' kind of person so this sort of thing typically does not affect me.

Ultimately, my question is, why didn't the break up with my ex affect me but why do I feel like I had my heart ripped out by this person, who I only went on two dates with and had only known for just over a month? I've been in several long (and very many short) term relationships but this felt (still feels) like a stab to the heart!",1,1763329074.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

**2️⃣ Ask better follow-up questions.**  
Push past small talk. Ask:  
• “What’s something you’ve been excited about lately?”

I, 34f,  teach special ed and am a huge empath. I've never been one to hold a grudge forgive WAY more than I should. 

2010- 18 year old me starts dating a guy from my high school.. (S). S tells, shows and treats me SO well but says he really can't get into a full relationship as he's shipping out for army basic training in a month. I try and tell him how important it is to have a support system. He agrees but sticks with his decision to not ""officially"" date as he doesn't want to make it too hard on either of us. Saying ""it's not like I'll have a new gf a week from now, I'm really  focused on this"". Accepting his decision, we agree to spend as much time for before he leaves and enjoy the time we have. 
Fast forward a week, S slowly started  ghosting me, not picking up my calls and comes up with different excuses as to why he can't hang out.. I get a phone call from a girl who MULTIPLE of my crushes hooked up with while in the talking stage and my ex cheated on me with (R). R asks what my interest in S is and what our ""status"" is. I let her know that we were talking, I'm interested in him and would appreciate her NOT going after this one for a change. I think you see where this is going. Literally a WEEK to the day, I find out S and R are dating, after he tells me that he's not going to be dating anyone prior to shipping out. 
He ""deeply"" apologizes and wants to stay in contact. My,stupid self,  agrees and we continue to write letters while in basic training, strictly as friends.. at some point S&R break up.. when he comes home from basic, he doesn't speak to or see her and instead wants to see me. (Trust me, hindsight really is 20/20) 
We hang out a few times (I want to emphasize to this day we've never slept together) and then he ships out and is stationed across seas. While stationed we keep in contact here and there (FB/ Snap) but ultimately continue to live our own lives over the years. 

A number of years later (2019?) S is discharged and returns back to  the states. The same contact continues, nothing formal, just a distant long time friend. 

2022- we reconnect on a more romantic level after I'm dealing with a break up. We spend hrs on the phone and video chats, reminiscing and thinking about ""what could have been"" and ""what could be"". I was planning a trip to the state he's in for my sisters bach party, and had planned to arrive a couple days early and spend some time together with the idea that maybe this would be our chance to ""see what happens"", but we are NOT in a relationship.
About a month before the trip, at the bar with some friends. My friends husband is using my phone to look for music to play. S calls and he answers it, completely jovial and having a good time. No malicious intention. S FREAKS out on me saying I'm a horror person, clearly not interested and upset allowed another man to answer my phone.I try over and over to explain he's just a friend, my friends husband, he was looking for music and was joking around.
I stopped answering his calls after I told him I needed time to process his reaction, as it really didn't make sense to me and I didn't feel I did anything wrong. We aren't dating, we haven't been in the same space in 10 yrs, and everything we were talking about was an ideal situation during my trip. 
He didn't respect my need for space, And for the next few weeks I received drunk calls, text and voice mails saying that he missed me, BEGGING to go back to how things were,  but never taking accountability for his part in the matter.
When the trip came, I chose not to see him. I was hurt that he took it so far, that he didn't trust me, the things he said. I was there for my sister's bach weekend and I wasn't going to let him ruin it. Things faded and we didn't really communicate.
2025- he moves back to our home town. I see a post on FB and leave a ""congrats! Welcome home"" comment.Thinking it's been yrs since the drama happened, I'm in a good relationship, I'm not holding a grudge.
He reaches out in a private msg, asking if I want to meet up for a coffee date and catch up.. I let him know it's exciting that he's home. I wasn't sure about meeting up, if felt disrespectful to my relationship given our history. So I led him on a little and said I'd let him know. I never got back to him and we never hung out.
He's been posting and sharing lives on Tik Tok sharing his art. I've jumped in a few  just to say hi and support his content. My intention was to be supportive and help him gain more traction
Recently I received a msg basically saying I'm only commenting so I can have him back in a line up, or can keep him from being in a relationship in the future Before I had any chance to respond.. BLOCKED

The following was all transcribed for Mr Joshua Tibbets’ audio log. No additions have been made at the request of the United States Government, and United States Navy.

Entry 1. Day 1

“Hello, uh this is Joshua Tibbets. This is going to be my audio log, I was going to be a journal, but I thought that this format may be better suited to the field of work I’m about to be in, and what my findings could be. For those using this audio log as a way to record my notes following my new position, again I am Joshua Tibbets, 36 years old, and I’m a Lieutenant Junior Grade, and have been in the Navy for 5 Years. I’m stationed aboard the USS. Mcallaster somewhere off the coast of Anchorage Alaska now, and we’re heading to what I believe to be where we’re going to be scouting for Chinese subs, or so I believe. Anywho, I thought I’d make a start on this thing before I forget, I feel like a journal, or a log is something you got to stick with or you'll just never do it. Gotta make it a habit. Mess Hall is calling us for supper now, so I’ll update this again in the morning. Alright, uh over and out? See ya.”

Transmission Ended.

Entry 2. Day 2

“Okay, well good morning! This is day two on our voyage. We’ve reached our patrol border to keep a look out for the Chinese and I think there will be a briefing after breakfast. I don’t think I can bring the recorder into the briefing which is a bummer, but I’ll give the jist of what our plans are. Also, I probably should mention why I am logging all of this. Prior to our departure, myself and 4 other seamen were chosen to conduct an observation and information gathering operation on the behaviour of the Chinese subs. This information would then be sent back to HQ and be implemented to better understand how to combat their technology, weapon systems, and so on. Besides myself, there is Reynolds, Harper, Richards, and Simmons. Harper being the senior seamen of the five of us. I’m sure I’ll have a better chance to meet Simmons and Reynolds soon, and maybe pick Harper’s brain, get some stories out of him. Richards is already part of my unit so I’d say he and I are already well acquainted. Ooh alright I think it’s time for the briefing, so I’ll be back shortly.”

Entry 3. Day 2

“Right, I’m back from the briefing. The ship will be getting the majority of the crew to begin their preparations for the Chinese sub operation aboard the ship. Positions are to be manned, equipment checked. The standard run-down for an operation of this nature. However, Reynolds, Harper, Richards, Simmons, and myself are being treated as a separate unit, and are being tasked with a different post all together, and it’s not on this ship. The briefing concluded with the captain asking the rest of the crews to leave, while we stayed behind to receive our orders. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good old secret, but I thought we were all in on the same mission here? Anyways, we hung back, and approached the captain. He told us that we’d be getting picked up from the loading bay at 17:30 in a Navy Dinghy boat, and taken to another nearby Navy observation facility that specialises in submersibles. I guess we’re going in subs then? Neat. They didn’t give us too much more to go on besides that, so I guess we'll sit here and wait until tonight. I sit here now looking out the porthole of my room and see little chunks of ice floating past. Alright, I’ll update again when the boat arrives. Over and out. Or Josh out. I haven’t quite worked that part out yet.”

Entry 4. Day 2

“Okay, it’s 17:27, we got word from the captain that the boat is here to pick us up. I’ve got my bags ready, room cleared out. I rate the room a 3 out of 5 stars. Sorry Navy. Let’s hope the next stay is a bit more luxurious than my dorm cubicle. Reynolds seems nervous to leave. I think he’s got this thing about water at night? I don’t know, something weird like that. Harper was giving him shit for it, telling him to suck it up or something to that effect. Besides that, no Chinese sub activity spotted yet which is a plus. I -” INDISCERNIBLE VOICE : “Tibbets, let's get a move on, boat’s here!”

“Okay, I don’t think I got this thing wet which is good, lights all come on when my voice is picked up. BEEP BEEP- yep, it works. Cool, uh, okay. Right, so the place where we are is pretty interesting. We’re about 2 miles away from the USS Mcalister, I can see its lights in the distance. It gets dark so quickly up here. It’s only 18:15 and it could be midnight for all I know, it's that dark. This place seems to be another branch off of the Navy’s research operation, and while I’ve been told it is, and they say it is, there’s very little US Navy insignias around. The claustrophobic walkways inside the metal hallways are rusted, and dimly lit, but then will have rooms with state of the art tech. I can always hear dripping water and machinery buzzing. We’ve been shown to our dorms which is where I am now. It’s dark, real dark. I’m going to put this down now and update tomorrow after our new orders are given to us by the team here in the briefing. Tibbets out.”

Entry 6. Day 3

“Well, good morning. Not the best sleep as I’d hoped. The boat, or station, rocked all night on the rough sea. Must’ve been some bad wind. I heard what I think was Simmon’s being sea sick last night, his dorm is across the hall from mine. I think this morning we will have a better chance to get to meet one another properly. They’ll probably want us to since we’re a small team who are meant to be working together. I think I’m going to head into the break room and get some coffee, mingle with some other of the crewmates who are up. I’ll be back to update soon, just a few hours or so.”

Entry 7. Day 3

""MRE’s for breakfast and the coffee was.. Well it was okay. I got to chat with Reynolds a bit. He’s from Texas and he’s 27. He’s been in the Navy for 3 years. Single, no kids. Like me. He’s eager to see what it is we’re going to be doing here. As am I. Soon after that Simmons came in too looking worse for wear. He had some coffee and ate what he could stomach. Ironic a guy who has seasickness is in the Navy of all places. Harper broke our conversation as he walked passed dressed in uniform already, and had an energy about him like he’d already been up for hours. What is it about older guys with that? Anyways, getting off topic, he ordered that we make our way down to the briefing room, and to get dressed asap. In the briefing room we were met by three Naval scientists in semi casual scientist gowns? There were another two naval officers in uniform also. They explained to us that the task we have been put on will span the next seven days, as they have had updated information from the USS Mcalister of some confirmed Chinese Submarine activity. I got pretty excited and I could see that Reynolds and Richards were too. The man running this operation, Mr Tom Leichman explained how we would be each undergoing different tests such as pressurisation tests, isolation and confinement tests before our individual descents under the ocean to record our findings, and report them back to the team and HQ.They told us that each of us would go down for a period of three hours at a time, and only one person could go down per day due to the restraints of the submersible, and reup times of the other machinery, fuel, and Chinese sub activity. We were dismissed, and were told that the tests and descents would start this afternoon. So, a lot to take in, but I am eagerly waiting to get started today. I will keep you posted. Tibbets out.”

Entry 8. Day 3

“We went in for our first pressurisation test today just after lunch. We each got to go into this room that was behind a seriously huge bulkhead. The room was fitted to look like the inside of a submarine, however we were told that the sub we would be using was only going to be big enough to house one occupant at a time. So I guess this was just purely a test on us. We climbed into our seats and strapped in. The door was shut, and the metal wheel was spun shut to lock it. A voice over the loudspeakers would inform us on every 100 feet that we went down. When the voice started to read out the initial depths, my body started to feel a bit heavy, but as the pressure was soon adjusted, it was like nothing was different in the slightest. However, when the voice started to read out depths much below that of any operational submarine I know of, I started to feel a bit worried. Just how advanced were these subs? Was the US Navy equipped to handle something that was lurking so deep beneath the surface? Of course with other subs they were, sure, but what sub is operating at the depth of the Titanic? After we came out of the pressurisation test, I saw some confused and concerned looks on the faces of the crew. I wonder if they had the same concerns I did. Next up was the isolation test which was to simulate the event of a power outage, or light failure and we’d need to be down there until a recovery crew came. For hours we sat in that room in the complete pitch black. Some of the men, I didn’t see who, started talking to things, or seeing things that weren't there. The brain can do some scary things. Tomorrow will be our first descent for one of the crew, so I’m going to put this away and hit the hay. I’m a bit anxious, but nonetheless excited. Tibbets out.”

Entry 9. Day 4

“Alright! Good morning. Today is the day! This is day two onboard the research facility, and today we dive! Well when I say we, I mean just one of us, but as a team this is the start of this operation for us. I can’t tell if the chills I get are from nervousness or excitement. Reynolds is the first to descend today. We’ll all be taking a group photo with him before he dives down. He’s going to head to his pressure and isolation checks shortly after a light breakfast, and no coffee. I think you can guess why. I’ll come back when Reynolds is in the water. Talk shortly.”

Transmission Ended.



Entry 10. Day 4

“We’re away! Reynolds is in the water and diving down. We got to see the sub he’s going in, and yeah it’s only really just big enough for one person. The front of it is a big steel bathysphere with a porthole window and light fixtures. The rear is in the shape of a fin, and has landers and propellers attached to the side. The whole apparatus however, is connected to a link at the top of the steel dome with an industry grade hook and steel cable which returns to the research facility. I can’t say I’ve seen something like it before. Reynolds seems to be descending quickly which is good, and from what I saw, the submersible is in a stable condition, and we’re receiving good data from it. Only issue is that the subs comms system isn’t functioning, so we can’y directly get in touch with Reynolds, nor can he to us. It will be a few hours now until Reynolds comes back to the surface, so I’ll update then. If anything of importance happens before then I’ll turn this back on. Tibbets out.”

Entry 11. Day 4

“Reynolds has returned to the surface. It’s been hours since we last saw him, and what we saw when we opened the hatch to the sub was nothing I was prepared for. The steel latches are released, the wheel spun and the hatch opened, and the opened hatch let out the loudest and most harrowing screams I have heard. The scientist team went into the docking room with protective uniforms and equipment on to retrieve Reynolds from the craft. His eyes were… His eyes were white, rolled into the back of his head, and his hands… God, his hands. They looked like they were cramped and spasming at the same time trying to grasp at his throat and his head. He was utterly delicious, screaming and shouting. I’d never seen anything like it. About 45 minutes later, the scientist came out from the medic bay and relayed to us what had happened. They claimed that he’d suffered an extremely freak accident where the air in the sub was not properly working as intended, leaving him with brain damage. I’ve never seen someone with brain damage act with that much energy though, usually they’re, well, a vegetable. Looking over at Simmons, he was as white as a ghost. Tomorrow is his turn, and we’ve been assured the sub will be worked on through the night. Let’s hope everything goes smoothly tomorrow. Tibbets out.”

Entry 12. Day 5.

""Morning. Though I don’t even know who I’m saying that for, but morning nonetheless. Everyone is on edge and pretty anxious today. After yesterday’s mishap, we’ve got every right to be. Reynolds still hasn’t been seen since he entered MedBay. We’ve already been briefed on the upgrades made to the subs capabilities that were worked on overnight, and there were even tests shown to prove it. I think this helped, but Simmons was still pale. Whether that was from seasickness or yesterday's events, I wasn’t sure. After his own pressure and isolation tests were done, it was time for him to climb in, and he did so with shaky hands. Thankfully the comms system has been brought back online so we’ll be able to have an actual line of communication this time. If anything happens during Simmons’ descent, I will record the audio. Tibbets out.”

Hey Josh. Yeah uh, man it’s so dark down here. The lights illuminate the few feet in front of me but that’s about it.” “Okay nice nice, how are you feeling? See any subs down there?” SIMMONS: ‘Yeah it uh, it's pretty claustrophobic but im okay. And no, no subs ye-” “Hey Simmons? Simmons? What's up?” SIMMONS: “I - I see… I see… oh.. OH.. OH MY GOD I SEE I-” “Simmons! What was that noise! Richards what was that bang?! Shit, Shit, bring him up now!”

“We brought the sub back to the surface and recovered Simmons. If what was left of him was even...him. His head, his fucking head. It was split open like a watermelon hit with buckshot. The walls of the sun were coated in blood. I turned away as they brought him out and I couldn’t look. I heard Richards be sick, and Harper let out a disgusted grunt. This is turning into a disaster. I don’t know why the US Navy would hand this team off to a group of scientists and engineers who can’t even put a fucking sub together properly. Especially for a mission as important as this. I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep tonight, and neither will Richards if I had to guess. He will be going down tomorrow.

Entry 15. Day 6.

“As I thought, I had a pretty sleepless night. I heard screams coming from what I can only assume as the med bay. Some new instructions have been given to us by the team aboard the facility. They told us, “If you start to see movement out of the porthole, use the camera provided to you to capture an Image. If the sub detects that it is being viewed, they may be using some type of disruptive and deadly, anti material ray. It may be ultrasonic which we believe is what caused Simmons' death.” So yeah. I’m not sure what to make of all this, however I’m hopeful that using the camera in Richard's descent will give us a better Idea what we’re working with here. I’ll come back when Richards is in the water. Tibbets out.”

The closest thing I can think of is that video of a guy taking a photo of a doorway where a ghost was in his house and it's the same, just black.

1oyxsb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oyxsb8/dear_diary/,"Dear Diary,","I'm just a human. I can't take this anymore. My heart has been shattered into million pieces, I'm in so much physical and emotional pain at the moment. I never thought we won't be together. I really thought, hoped and prayed he's the one that I was going to grow old with. I lit candles for him in my church. I told my younger brother about him. I was just as broken when his senior puppy passed away as I was when mine passed away. I wanted to hold him and wipe every tear, heal his heart and soul, heal his inner child. I wanted to fall asleep next to him every night, I wanted to one day adopt the dachshund Dudley we joked and talked so much about. I've been through breakups but never like this one. I've never had a stronger feeling and desire to be in my 60's and making tea for him in our little home. I've never loved a partner so much in my life, I've never given so much of my heart, been so pure for someone and poured so much into a relationship. I think I'm forever broken, I don't believe in love anymore. Why wasn't I enough? I've been waiting for a whole year for small steps, I prayed he could do something to stop me. Now he's blocked everywhere, I haven't blocked his number and I pray he calls but I don't have the strength to pick up, nor can I hung up. We work in the same office. I'll see him two or three times per week. I can't look him in the eyes. Earlier this month we went to a wedding, we looked beautiful, he kissed me in front of everyone, it didn't matter whether it was the whole office attending the wedding. A coworker even took this beautiful picture of us. This is the picture of us I love the most, shortly I had it as my wallpaper. My body is shaking, I have tears and I think I'll drown in my own tears. Why does it feel like my heart is aching and why does my body hear when my emotions are hurt? I don't understand biology but I understand heartbreak. I wish I was enough for him to love me the same way. I know he has had only one long relationship before me but he was everything to me. I poured so much into this, I can't imagine myself with someone else. I will never love the same way. I just want him to hold me in his arms for one last time, kiss my forehead and make a dumb joke that I laugh at. I'll never hold his hand, I'll never wear the adorable slippers I bought for his flat, I'll never get water at midnight by him when I ask him to bring me a cup. I'll never scratch his back again for half an hour, I'll never put football stickers around the town with him, hear him sing in the car, smell his perfume. Why wasn't my love enough for him to change, to try and be better, to throw away the old baggage and start from scratch with me. I was ready to wait forever, I was ready to do everything, I sacrificed myself. He'll never read this but I love you. I wish I could stay, I wish you could listen when I tell you what I need to stay. You can feed me bread crumbs and I'll stay, as long as you're holding me in your arms. I can't scream no more, I can't talk no more, I can't fall apart in front of you. I was too much, we had the same argument over and over but you promised me we'll be fine. You promised me you'll get there. We'll grow old together. You said it'll all be fine. It's not fine. Was my love not enough, was my one year not enough, was everything I did not enough. I wanted to bring you to my next tattoo appointment, you said you'll bring me coffee and sweets while I'm getting my flower sleeve done. Now I have my favourite chocolate next to me and I don't wanna eat. I don't wanna drink. I don't wanna sleep. I wanna be in your arms, in your warm bed, smelling you and playing the Who am I? game. I wanna write in your mom's crossword and I wanna hold you while we talk about your (ours) dog. I loved her so much, I can't believe my baby's gone. Both of our staffies are gone. I prayed so hard for her healing, my little sweet Penny girl. And my little Rita. You would have loved her, they had so much in common. Our adorable little puppies. My heart and my soul. I wish you knew how much I imagined us as a small little family, will you even miss me? Did you even love me? Are you hurt or are you gonna forget me forever? All the sticky notes I gave you secretly in the office when we started dating and we were hiding. Our walks from the office to our area back home. Our lunches, all the movies you watched and I fell asleep in your lap. All the stupid inside jokes, all the laughs, songs we shared together. I can't get over the fact that I won't be in your arms ever again. I love you so much and I don't even know why. Maybe I loved what we could have been, I really wanted you to meet my family and get a home together. I had to walk away, I couldn't stay from the pain and betrayal of my trust. But I can't walk away too, I can't be with another one. I want to get all the Pink Floyd roses from you, get your football stickers, buy all the stuff for my new flat with you. I wish you knew how much you broke me. Would you have turned the time back? I would never unkiss you, never unhug you, never unlove you. You're everything I ever wanted in a human being, I know deep down inside that if I swallow everything, if I stay and I'm silent, if i sit and wait, maybe one day we'll be where we need to be to grow together. But I lost myself. I cried myself to bed every night, that night when I told you I was stretching at the end of your bed kneeling and I was crying my eyes out, I was praying for us. I prayed over you. I imagined us so many times with a baby, dressing it up as a cute bear or a dinosaur. I imagined us being old and me holding your old wrinkly hand in the park. I loved our slow morning, cuddles in bed and getting breakfast or lunch together in your area. I loved getting for your desk cup all the papers with quotes on them from the cafe where I get my coffee from. I love you and I wish you knew how much I fought to stay this long, how much I'll be fighting to stay away and how much I'll be regretting not growing old with you. I love you and I know you're my soulmate. I pray to God we find each other in another lifetime too and be happy until our last breath.",4,1763328643.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1oyxon2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1oyxon2/ran_into_my_ex_yesterday_after_4_years_of_no/,Ran into my ex yesterday after 4 years of No Contact — and I surprised myself,"Yesterday something happened that I’ve dreaded for years: I ran into my ex. No warning, no buildup, just a sudden “Hi 
<my name>” from behind me while I was standing outside a café waiting for my coffee.

For context, this is the same person I loved deeply, the one I went fully No Contact with in 2021. Four years of silence. No peeking, no social media, no “happy birthday” texts. Just complete distance.

So here’s how it went.

I turned around, saw her, and instinctively said hey. Gave her a quick side hug, which she reciprocated. She asked how I’d been, I asked her the same. Light small talk. Nothing dramatic. She said she was there for a walk, I joked it was far from her place. She laughed. She asked if this was my new hangout spot. I said not really, I was just grabbing coffee.

It was normal. Civil. Almost boring.

But then, in the middle of the conversation, I felt that familiar wave building — the emotional overload you can’t describe to anyone except people on this subreddit. I went quiet for a couple seconds. She noticed that I’m not trying to fill all silence, wrapped it up with a “Alright then, bye take care,” and I said, “you too! Have a good one.”

And that was it. She walked away. I walked back to my friend, got in the car, and waited for the emotional collapse I was expecting.

It didn’t come.

Sure, I felt a little sadness on the drive back. A small sting. The old ghost of what I used to feel. I even had a dream about her later — I always do any time she appears in my life in any form. But the dream wasn’t devastating. It wasn’t meaningful. It was just… a dream.

And when I woke up? I was fine.

I made my coffee, saw my parents, hung out with a friend, and went about my day. No meltdown. No spiraling. No crawling back mentally to 2021. Instead, I felt calm. Proud. Steady. Liberated.

Here’s the part I want to share with anyone struggling in the early stages of No Contact:

You don’t realize how much you’ve changed until life tests you.

Four years ago, that same interaction would have ruined me for weeks. I would have replayed every second, wondered if I should have said more, panicked about what she was thinking, checked her socials, maybe even reached out.

But No Contact gave me back something I didn’t have then: self-respect.

Not the loud kind. Not the “I don’t care about them at all” kind. The quiet kind — the type where you can stand in front of the person who broke your heart, talk to them like a human being, feel the emotions rise, and still hold yourself with dignity.

I didn’t beg.
I didn’t look desperate.
I didn’t crumble.
I didn’t chase.
I didn’t make it weird.

I just existed as myself — someone who healed enough to stay grounded in a moment that used to terrify me.

Here’s the truth:
Seeing them again doesn’t set you back. It shows you how far you’ve come.

Whether they come back or not doesn’t matter — because the power they once had over your life is gone. The old version of you who would have shattered? He’s gone too. What’s left is someone who can meet their past face-to-face without losing themselves.

If you’re deep in the pain right now, wondering if No Contact is worth it, listen carefully: it is.

It gives you back your strength.
It gives you back your dignity.
It gives you back your life.

And one day — maybe years down the line — you’ll run into them by accident. And instead of falling apart, you’ll walk away feeling lighter, stronger, and strangely proud of who you’ve become.

Stay the course. No Contact works.",12,1763328390.0,ExNoContact,2,1.0,False

1oyxncz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ynaka_/comments/1oyxncz/my_bestfriend_of_14_years_has_stolen_from_my/,MY BESTFRIEND OF 14 YEARS HAS STOLEN FROM MY MOTHER AND LET ME TAKE ALL THE BLAME,"Long post ahead, please bear with me, I really need advice.

I have a best friend, we've been friends since junior high. We're like sisters and my family loves her. My mother treated her like her own daughter, she would cook for her when she requested her favorite dish, she would invite her in our family gathering, she would ask her to visit every Christmas to give her aguinaldo, she would do everything a mother would do for her daughter.

As my bestfriend of more than a decade, I thought I knew her. She was my safe space, She knew everything about me. My heartaches, my secret, my struggles. She was there when no one else was. She was my day one. Even in my lowest, she never left me. We knew each other to the bones. To make it short she's like me just in another body. That's how much I knew her, or so I thought.

So, these past few months my mother keeps missing money. The first time she noticed, she straight up asked me if I took money from her wallet. My sensitive ass got hurt and told her no, and that why everytime something got missing I was always the one she blames.  Then, the second time, she told me that 7k is missing from her wallet. I told her to just put Cctv so we can see whoever is stealing money from her because it's hard to point fingers especially if you don't have a proof. But since all us were busy doing our own stuff, the cctv thing was forgotten. The third time was when she went home early and asked if she could speak to me. We went to her room to talk in private. The moment we sat down, she immediately asked me how I could steal from her. I was so hurt and confused, I told her I never had steal from her and never will. She told me money had gone missing from her wallet again, and that I'm the only one who has access to her room and that everytime I'm in the house is the time when her money had gone missing. I tried to defend myself telling her to check on my things to see if I have it but she ignored it. She was CONVINCED that I was the one stealing from her. I was hurt but couldn't blame her because if I was her I would think the same thing. After our conversation, I left the house and went to my boyfriends house. I stayed for a couple of days thinking that at some point my mother will have her mmoney stolen again by the person whose been stealing from her since IT WASN'T ME and that maybe then she will realize. But to my surprise, nothing was stolen eversince I left home. I was so mad because I don't know how to convince them that I wasn't me.

So weeks go by, I had plans with my best friend, we had coffee and visited our other friend. When I got home, I came across my mother, she looks so mad and has teary eyes. She asked where's my bestfriend and wanted to speak with her. I immediately sensed that something was wrong so I asked her why. She told me that money had gone missing again and when she asked my niece who entered her room, my niece said my best friend's name. I was confused and in denial. I told her my best friend would never do that. My mom told me when that when my niece told her about my best friend going inside her room, she started to realize that every time her money was stolen, my best friend was always in the house with me. And when I asked more details about the incident earlier that day, I didn't know how to feel about it. Everything made sense. I started to have doubt on my best friend but I still told my mother that my best friend could neverrrr. After that night my mother finally decided to put CCTV.

And a month later came the worst day of my life. My best friend came to our house because we had dinner planned. When she went to my room I was still asleep. She woke me up and asked me to take a bath already so we can meet with our friends early. When I went downstairs, she followed me saying she'll grab some water. When I entered the bathroom, my brain immediately said ""THIS IS DE JAVU"" that moment was the exact same moment that happened when my mother told me that her money had gone missing and the one person that entered her room was my best friend. I felt nervous but brushed it off. Just minutes after,my brother knocked on the door of the bathroom and told me that he's going to speak to my best friend I asked him why and he showed me the cctv footage. I WAS SHOCKED. IT WAS HER ALL ALONG.

I didn't know what to do. When she was confronted by my brother she denied everything even when he showed her the footage. I tried to back her up as I didn't want her to feel that she was being ganged up on. And also in that moment I was still in denial. She kept denying it, telling us different narrative, and that the only reason she was in the room was because she was looking for my niece. But it was clear on the footage that she was rummaging through my mother's drawer where she sashes her money and her valuable stuff.

When she went home I tried to watch the footage again,trying to convince myself that maybe everything was just a misunderstanding, I watched it multiple times and ended up just feeling empty.

All this time, it was her. What's strange is I'm not mad at all. Now all I feel is sadness. I started to doubt everything we Had. Every time I opened up to her and she was comforting me, acted concerned, stayed by my side. None of that was real. I love her and I trust her so much to the point that my brain automatically filtered out the possibility. My family especially my mother also feel the same way. She wasn't mad, just sad and disappointed, after all, for her, she was her daughter too.

I don't know if I can lose her. She's my BEST FRIEND. I'm incomplete without her. I don't know what to do. She never reached out to me ever since she only reached out to our other friend trying to cover up her lies.

Should I just cut her off or should I talk to her and give her a chance to explain? If it were only for me I could forgive her, but it still hurts knowing that she also deceived my mother.",1,1763328305.0,u_ynaka_,0,1.0,False

Name: Derek Baldwin

Occupation: Part-time firefight; Full-time accident prone idiot.

Appearance: Tends to dress modestly. Keeps a beard and low hair cut. 

Martial status: Full-time simp for one of the most unlikeable characters on this show. He tends to have more chemistry with any woman who isn't Ashley. However, because she is the only young white woman on this show, and the two of them are the most noticeable oddballs of cream in this coffee, he is *forced* to continue simping for her. 

He went head first into simp land when he made the decision to hide behind his paralysis to keep Ashley glued to his side out of pity. 

She found out, blew up, tried to crawl back to Andre, got the cold shoulder from him, and now she is coping pleas for Derek's deceit presumably to justify her forthcoming decision to eventually take him back (God lawd...SMH). 

He had a badass latina (I mean the woman was gorgeous) ready to risk it all, but all he could think about is Ashley (SMDH). What kind of shit is that?

Let's face it, the writers have no idea what to do with this character. 

My theory is he is part of *the quota* for this show. 

I don't completely hate the character, but I spend most of my time thinking WTF when watching him and his actions. Sigh...",4,1763328256.0,BeyondTheGatesCookout,1,1.0,False

1oyxju8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oyxju8,Anyone know this novel?,"I'd just wanted to bring my husband the dinner he'd asked for, a little surprise. But I hadn't expected to hear the one thing that would break me forever.
Out of his office, I heard him speaking in a soft and intimate tone.
“I love you, Kara. I need you.” 
“Me too, honey. I can’t wait to see you tonight.” A sweet voice with a hint of giggling muffled through the phone.
My hand went to my mouth to stifle the sob that tried to escape, but it was too late.
What had happened? How long has this been going on? 
How could he look at me, hold me, ki-ss me, and still be so lost in someone else?
I pushed the door open, gaze locked onto him. 
""Mia. Please, Mia,"" Aaron stepped towards me, voice tight. ""I need to explain.""
""What's there to explain, Aaron? You've already said everything I need to hear.""
""I didn't mean it the way you think,"" he said, his voice tightening. ""I swear. It's complicated.""
""No,"" I said, my voice sharp now, unable to keep the edge out. ""It's not complicated. You made a choice. And that choice wasn't me.""
He didn't need me. He had her.
I had been a fool. A naive fool, believing in something that wasn't real.
I was done.
————————
Mia's POV
I never thought it would end this way. Not like this. Not after everything we'd built. The life we dreamed of, the house we were supposed to grow old in, the family we swore we'd be together, forever. Aaron and I were supposed to be the kind of couple people envied. You know, the ones who seem untouchable. A perfect match. And I believed it. I believed him. Every promise he made. Every ki-ss that lingered just a little longer. Every look that said ""I'm here, and I'm never leaving.""
But that was before I found out. Before everything came crashing down, shattering in a thousand pieces I couldn't glue back together.
I stood there, frozen, in the doorway, my heart beating so loudly I couldn't hear my thoughts. I'd just wanted to bring Aaron the dinner he'd asked for, a little surprise. But I hadn't expected to hear the one thing that would break me forever.
""I love you, Kara. I need you.""
I could barely breathe as those words cut through me. My hand went to my mouth to stifle the sob that tried to escape, but it was too late. The world around me blurred as I took a step back, my vision clouded by the onslaught of tears. I hadn't meant to overhear. I never should have. But at that moment, everything I thought I knew was a lie. The man I loved wasn't the man I thought he was. The man I thought would be by my side forever had already moved on.
Kara. The name felt like acid on my tongue. I didn't even know her, but that didn't matter. She was the one Aaron wanted. And in that instant, I knew, really knew, that our future was never going to be the same. That perfect little world I'd lived in for so long had come crashing down, and there was no way to fix it.
I had questions. So many of them. What had happened? How long has this been going on? How could he look at me, hold me, ki-ss me, and still be so lost in someone else? But as I stood there, watching him laugh with Kara on the phone, I realized I didn't want the answers. Because the answers would only tear me apart even more.
He didn't even know I was there. He didn't know I'd overheard him. He didn't know that in that moment, everything changed.
And it was in that silence, that deafening quiet where I realized one simple truth: I wasn't enough for him.
His love wasn't enough for me anymore either.
Everything I had ever believed about us shattered in the blink of an eye. The promises he'd made to me, ""I'll always choose you. I'll always be here"", they meant nothing now. They were just words. Empty words he'd said without thinking, said to keep me close, to keep me believing in the lie that was our life together.
I swallowed hard, my throat tight with the weight of my betrayal. I wanted to scream at him. To confront him. To demand answers, to make him feel the same devastation coursing through me. But what was the point? It was clear now. He didn't need me. He had her.
And maybe, just maybe, the worst part of it all was that I wasn't surprised. Not really. Because somewhere deep down, I'd known. I had felt it, the distance in his touch, the absence in his eyes when he ki-ssed me. He'd been slipping away, and I'd been too blind, too wrapped up in my own need for him, to see it.
A cold, empty laugh bubbled up from my chest, and I clamped a hand over my mouth to silence it. Tears welled up in my eyes again, but I didn't let them fall. Not yet. Not until I was far away from him.
I turned around, my legs shaky beneath me as I stumbled back toward the door. But I didn't stop. I couldn't. I was done. The door closed quietly behind me, and the sound was final, too final. The silence that followed echoed louder than anything I'd ever heard in my life. The silence of a broken future. A future I'd once thought was mine.
The world outside felt too bright, too loud. I didn't belong here anymore. Not in this life. Not in the world I'd been living in, one where Aaron was my everything. The man I trusted, the man I loved. Gone. And in his place? A man who had betrayed me, who had replaced me without a second thought.
I walked aimlessly, my feet taking me down a path I hadn't planned on walking. The streetlights cast long shadows, and the air felt too cold on my skin, like the chill of abandonment seeping into my bones. My chest ached with every breath I took, and I kept walking, the sound of my footsteps echoing in my ears. I had no destination. No plan. Just an overwhelming need to escape.
Escape the life I thought I had.
I could feel the sting of betrayal with every step I took, and yet, there was something else there too. Something I wasn't ready to face, but couldn't deny. Anger. Rage, even. Because this wasn't just Aaron's fault. It was mine too. I had let myself believe that I was enough. I had let myself fall so deeply in love with him that I'd ignored the signs. Ignored the moments when he pulled away, when he wasn't fully present.
I didn't blame him entirely. I blamed myself too.
I had been a fool. A naive fool, believing in something that wasn't real. Because if it had been real, Aaron wouldn't have been able to walk away so easily. If our love had been real, he would've fought for me. But he didn't.
The tears came then, hot and fierce, as they finally broke free. I wiped them away angrily, not caring if anyone saw me. I didn't care about anything anymore. My world had fallen apart, and I was the only one left holding the wreckage.
I thought about Lucas, my son, and the life I needed to build for him. The future I'd promised him. I wasn't going to let Aaron's betrayal destroy that. I couldn't. I had to be strong for him. I had to show him what resilience looked like, what it meant to rise from the ashes.
I stood at the edge of the street, my mind reeling, my heart breaking, and I made a decision. I wasn't going to let this ruin me. I wouldn't let Aaron have that power. I would walk away. For Lucas. For me.
And so, I did.
I walked away, leaving behind the pieces of a broken future. The future I had imagined with Aaron. I walked away because I had no other choice. The weight of betrayal was too heavy to bear, and I could feel it sinking deep into my soul. But I couldn't stay there. I couldn't stay in that broken world.
And as I walked into the night, away from everything I had known, I realized that maybe, just maybe, I had finally found the strength to let go.
Mia's POV
I woke up to the sound of Lucas' laughter, sweet and innocent, echoing through the house like it always did. I should've felt a sense of peace in that sound, but today, it only made the ache in my chest worse. The truth was a weight I could no longer ignore.
Aaron had betrayed me.
And now, I was stuck in the aftermath of a lie that I couldn't untangle. No matter how many times I replayed the night I'd overheard him on the phone with Kara, the woman he claimed he was ""in love"" with, the pain still cut through me. It didn't matter that I was the one who had given him everything. The love, the devotion, the sacrifices. None of it mattered. He'd chosen her.
I let out a breath, steadying myself. Lucas needed me to be strong. He needed me to keep it together, even if my world was falling apart around me.
""Mom!"" Lucas called from the kitchen, snapping me out of my spiral.
I blinked, wiped the tears that had threatened to fall, and forced a smile. There was no room for weakness today. Not with him. Not when he needed me more than ever.
I stood up from the bed and walked to the kitchen. Lucas was already digging into his cereal, his dark curls messy from sleep, his bright eyes full of the energy only a six-year-old could have. I didn't want him to see the cracks in me, but I could feel them, deep inside, splintering with every step I took toward him.
""You ready for school, buddy?"" I asked, my voice slightly strained, but I managed to keep it steady.
He looked up and nodded enthusiastically, his spoon clinking against the bowl. ""Yep! I'm going to be the best at show-and-tell today.""
I chuckled, though it didn't reach my eyes. ""I'm sure you will. Just remember, no monster trucks this time.""
He rolled his eyes playfully, and for a split second, it was like everything was normal again. But the truth lingered in the corners of my mind, like a shadow I couldn't outrun.
I grabbed the milk from the fridge and poured him another glass, my hands shaking as I did.
Every motion felt mechanical, like I was just going through the motions of being his mom. But deep down, I wasn't sure I even knew who I was anymore.
Was I the woman Aaron had promised to love forever? Or was I just a chapter in his life he'd quickly closed?
I tried to push those thoughts away. It wasn't about me anymore. It was about Lucas. Always about Lucas. I had to keep it together for him.
I set the glass down in front of him, and he flashed me a smile that made my heart ache. ""Thanks, Mom.""
""Of course, sweetheart,"" I said, my voice tight. I leaned down and ki-ssed the top of his head, trying to hold back the tears that burned my eyes.
Just then, I heard the front door open and shut. My heart skipped a beat.
Aaron.
I froze, the air in the room thickening. I didn't have to look to know it was him. The way his footsteps echoed in the hallway was unmistakable. He hadn't been home last night, and I hadn't expected him to be.
I had told myself I'd be fine without him, that I didn't need him. But it was hard to ignore the pull of the life we had built. Even harder to ignore the love that still lingered in my chest.
""Mia,"" Aaron's voice came, low and hesitant, from the doorway.
I didn't turn to face him. Instead, I focused on Lucas, who was happily eating his cereal, blissfully unaware of the storm that had been brewing.
""I'm not ready to talk,"" I said, my voice steady but laced with the pain I could no longer hide.
""Please, Mia,"" Aaron's voice softened, stepping closer to me. ""I need to explain.""
I swallowed the lump in my throat. He needed to explain? How could he explain away the fact that he'd chosen someone else? That he'd been so willing to throw away everything we had for a woman who wasn't me?
I gripped the edge of the counter to steady myself. ""What's there to explain, Aaron? You've already said everything I need to hear.""
""I didn't mean it the way you think,"" he said, his voice tightening. ""I swear. It's complicated.""
""No,"" I said, my voice sharp now, unable to keep the edge out. ""It's not complicated. You made a choice. And that choice wasn't me.""
There was silence in the room, thick and suffocating. I could feel Aaron's gaze on my back, but I refused to turn around. I couldn't. If I looked at him, I knew I'd break. If I let him see how much this was tearing me apart, he'd only use it against me. I couldn't give him that satisfaction.
""You have to understand, Mia,"" Aaron continued, his voice pleading now. ""I never wanted to hurt you. I love you.""
I closed my eyes, feeling a sting deep in my chest. ""You love me?"" I laughed, but it was bitter, tinged with the hurt I couldn't shake. ""Is that why you were with her, Aaron? Is that why you, "" I stopped myself before I could say it. The truth was too painful to even acknowledge out loud.
""I was confused. But I swear, it's not what you think. Kara... she's pregnant. And I, ""
I turned around sharply, cutting him off.
""Pregnant? You think that's an excuse?""
Lucas, oblivious to the emotional battlefield happening around him, picked up his toy truck and started rolling it across the table, completely unfazed.
I looked at Aaron, really looked at him, for the first time since I'd overheard his conversation with Kara. His face was tired, his eyes filled with regret, but it wasn't enough. It would never be enough.
I didn't want his regret. I didn't want his apology. I wanted the man who had once looked at me like I was everything. The man who had promised me that no matter what happened, we'd face it together. But that man was gone. And all I had left was this stranger who couldn't even tell me the truth.
""I don't care about the excuses, Aaron,"" I said, my voice quieter now, but every word cutting through the air like a knife. ""You've made your choice. And now I have to make mine.""
I walked toward the living room, every step feeling heavier than the last. I could feel Aaron's eyes on me, but I didn't look back. I couldn't.
""Mia, please don't do this,"" he called after me, his voice breaking.
But I had already made up my mind.
I paused at the door, looking at Lucas as he played in his own little world. He had no idea what was going on, no idea that his entire life was about to change.
""I can't do this anymore, Aaron,"" I whispered, so quietly I wasn't sure if he heard me. But I didn't wait for him to respond. I turned the handle and stepped out of the house, slamming the door behind me with a force that echoed in my chest.
I didn't know where I was going. I didn't care. All I knew was that I couldn't stay in that house, in that life, with the man who had torn my heart into pieces.
And as I walked away, my chest tight with every step, I finally accepted the truth.
I had to leave Aaron for good.
And it was going to hurt more than anything I'd ever felt, but I had no choice. For Lucas. For me. I had to move on. No matter how much it hurts.
Aaron's POV
The house felt wrong the moment I stepped through the door. The emptiness hit me like a punch to the gut. The place we had shared, the place I'd imagined us building our future, now felt hollow. Cold.
I ran a hand through my hair, trying to shake the weight of the world off my shoulders, but it was useless. Mia's absence was a constant, like a shadow that wouldn't leave me. Her things were still here, her shoes by the door, the perfume she always wore lingering in the air. The silence was deafening without her laughter, without the hum of life that used to fill the space.
But it was what I deserved.
I'd broken her. Completely.
She hadn't even said goodbye. The door had slammed behind her, and I hadn't even had a chance to explain.
But then again, what explanation could I give? How could I make sense of the mess I'd created?
I had done this. I'd ruined us. I'd chosen Kara, chosen the easy, uncomplicated path. And now, Mia is gone. For good.
My phone buzzed in my pocket, snapping me out of the fog of guilt. I pulled it out, my heart racing at the sight of her name on the screen. Mia. I swallowed hard and immediately hit the answer button, knowing full well she wouldn't pick up.
""Come on, Mia,"" I muttered under my breath. ""Just pick up.""
The voicemail beeped in my ear, and I cursed under my breath. What had I expected? She hadn't answered any of my texts. She hadn't responded to my calls. She hadn't even opened the da-mn door when I showed up this morning. I was a ghost to her now, someone she no longer recognized.
""I'm sorry,"" I said into the voicemail, my voice cracking despite myself. ""I know I've messed everything up, but please... I need to talk to you. Please. Just... call me back.""
I ended the call, my fingers trembling as I lowered the phone.
What had I expected? A miracle? Mia wasn't going to just forgive me. Not after everything. Not after what I'd done.
But I couldn't let her go.
I couldn't let go of her.
Kara's voice echoed in my head, cutting through my thoughts. ""You have to let Mia go, Aaron. It's over. She'll never forgive you.""
Her words were harsh, but she was right. Mia wasn't going to forgive me. She was too strong, too proud. But the guilt, the constant, gnawing guilt, was eating me alive.
I had promised her forever. I had promised her everything, and now, it was all gone. I had betrayed her. I had betrayed the one person who had ever really loved me.
I sank down onto the couch, running my hands over my face in frustration. Kara was here, living with me. The woman I had chosen. But it didn't feel right. She wasn't her, she wasn't Mia.
I had made a choice, but now, I was questioning everything. The pressure of this mess was suffocating me.
The promises I had made to Kara, the promises I had made to Mia, they were all just lies now.
I thought I had been honest with myself. I thought I had chosen Kara because I wanted to, not because I was too weak to face the reality of my situation. But I hadn't realized until it was too late, until Mia walked out, that Kara wasn't the one I was in love with.
It was Mia. Always Mia.
God, how had I let this happen? How had I gotten so caught up in my own selfish desires that I forgot about the woman who had been everything to me?
The sharp buzz of my phone interrupted my thoughts again.
It's her again.
This time, I didn't hesitate. I answered before it could even ring.
""Mia?"" I asked, my voice filled with hope and desperation.
The line was silent for a long, agonizing beat. I could hear her breathing, soft, but tense.
""I'm not ready to talk to you,"" she said finally, her voice cold and distant.
It hurt. It stung to hear her say that. But I knew I deserved it.
""I understand,"" I replied, fighting the lump in my throat. ""But Mia, please... just hear me out. I never meant to hurt you. You have to believe me. I, ""
""You don't get it, do you?"" Her voice broke through the line, sharp and angry now. ""You chose her, Aaron. You chose her. Don't you dare try to justify it. I can't hear your excuses.""
I clenched my jaw. She was right. I couldn't justify it.
""I know. I messed up, Mia,"" I said quietly, feeling the weight of the words as I spoke them. ""But please, just... talk to me. Let me fix this.""
There was a long pause. For a second, I thought she might say something, might give me the chance to explain. But then, the line went dead.
I was left staring at the phone, staring at the screen like it could somehow undo the damage I had done. But it was pointless.
She didn't want to talk to me. She didn't want me anymore.
And that realization hit me harder than anything else.
I looked over at the kitchen, the one I had shared with Mia for so many years. The life we had built, the dinners we cooked together, the quiet mornings spent laughing over coffee. It felt like another lifetime now. Another reality I would never get back.
Kara was still here, of course. She had her stuff scattered all over the house, her clothes in the closet, her toothbrush in the bathroom, the whisper of her presence still lingering in every room. But every time I looked at her, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was all wrong.
She wasn't Mia.
And yet, I had to face the reality. I had made a choice, and now, I had to live with it. Kara was pregnant with my child. I couldn't just walk away from that.
But the truth was, no matter how hard I tried to convince myself that Kara was the right choice, every fiber of my being was telling me it was Mia I wanted.
I had messed up.
I had lost the woman who had been my world.
And now, I was paying the price.
I stood up and walked to the window, looking out at the world beyond the glass. The future I had imagined was slipping through my fingers, piece by piece. And there was no one to blame but myself.
I had ruined it all.
Mia's POV
I never thought I'd be here. Standing in the middle of a room that was still so unfamiliar. My fingers curled into the soft fabric of the couch, the scent of fresh paint hanging in the air. It wasn't home yet, not even close, but it had to be. For Lucas.
I let out a breath, my chest tightening as I surveyed the tiny apartment. Two bedrooms, a cramped kitchen, and a living room that would be perfect for us if I could just get the da-mn boxes unpacked. The walls were bare, the floors cold. It was a far cry from the warm, cozy house we had once shared with Aaron. The house where everything had fallen apart.
But that was the past. The ghosts of our former life haunted every inch of this new place, but I couldn't afford to dwell on that anymore. Not now. Not with Lucas looking at me like I was his whole world, like I was the only one who could fix this. And maybe, in some ways, I was.
I glanced over at him. He was sitting on the floor, happily coloring in his new little corner of the living room, completely oblivious to the emotional storm swirling around me.
The sound of his laughter should've been a comfort, but right now, it felt like a constant reminder of the weight of responsibility on my shoulders.
I had to make this work. For him.
I sank down onto the couch, pulling my knees to my chest, feeling the weight of it all press down on me. I hadn't expected this to be easy. No one told you how hard it would be to start over, how impossible it would feel when you're so deep in the rubble of your own life that you can't even see a way out.
But the moment Aaron left, I knew there was no going back. No matter how much I still loved him, no matter how much I wished things had turned out differently, there was no undoing the damage he'd caused. I couldn't raise Lucas in that environment, not with the constant tension, the lies hanging in the air. I had to protect him. And that meant walking away from the man I had once thought would be by my side forever.
I rubbed my temples, trying to get the headache away.
""Mom!"" Lucas called, pulling me out of my thoughts. His little face lit up as he stood and ran over to me. He was so full of energy, so full of life. He didn't deserve to be dragged through this mess.
""Hey, sweetie,"" I said, forcing a smile as he climbed up onto the couch beside me.
He looked up at me, his big brown eyes wide with curiosity. ""Are we gonna stay here forever?""
The question caught me off guard. I had been so caught up in the logistics of making this apartment livable that I hadn't even thought about how it might feel for him.
I swallowed, trying to keep my voice steady. ""We're going to make this our home, Lucas. It's just going to take some time.""
He nodded solemnly, as though he understood, and then went back to playing.
I watched him for a moment, my heart swelling with love and guilt. How could I have been so blind to what Aaron was doing? To how he was pulling away from us, from me? How could I have ignored the signs for so long? The lies. The secrecy. The way he'd looked at me, but not really seen me anymore.
And now, here I was, in this tiny apartment, trying to rebuild everything from the ground up.
But the hardest part? It wasn't the bills. It wasn't the packing, the moving, the late-night worrying about how I would make it all work. It was the way I still felt him in every corner of the room. The way his absence was like a shadow I couldn't escape.
I thought I'd gotten used to the silence, the way the bed felt too big without him in it, how the mornings felt incomplete without the sound of his voice. But it wasn't just the quiet that unsettled me. It was an ache in my chest. By the way, no matter how much I told myself I was better off, I still longed for him. For the life we had.
The life that was never going to come back.
And that was the part that hurt the most.
The tears welled up again, but I blinked them away, willing them not to fall. Lucas didn't need to see me break down. He needed to see me as strong, strong enough to make this work. Strong enough to be everything he needed. Because, in the end, that was all that mattered.
Not Aaron. Not the life I thought we would have.
Just Lucas.
I forced myself up from the couch and walked over to the small kitchen, trying to keep my mind busy.
I opened a cupboard, pulling out a box of cereal for Lucas. But my hands trembled, the weight of my own emotions threatening to overtake me.
Let it go, Mia. You have to let go.
The voice was quiet but persistent, echoing in my head.
I knew I couldn't keep holding on to the past. I knew I couldn't keep wondering what could've been. The truth was simple: Aaron had chosen Kara. And no matter how much I still loved him, no matter how much I wanted to believe he would come back, the reality was that he had moved on.
I was done being the woman who waited for him to choose me. I was done being the woman who let her life revolve around his decisions.
I had spent too long waiting for him to come back. And that time? It was over.
I needed to focus on the future, the future that I had the power to shape. I was the only one who could create a happy life for Lucas. I was the only one who could rebuild our world.
I just had to take the first step.
I took a deep breath and turned back to Lucas, forcing a smile. ""Alright, kiddo,"" I said, grabbing the cereal and pouring it into a bowl. ""Let's make today a good day, okay?""
He looked up at me, grinning ear to ear. ""Okay, Mom!""
It was a small victory, but it was enough. The way he looked at me with those innocent eyes made me realize just how important it was to keep going. For him. I wasn't just a victim of the past. I was his mother. I was his protector.
And for that, I couldn't afford to keep looking back.
Later that night, after I had tucked Lucas into bed and the apartment was quiet, I stood by the window, looking out at the city. The streetlights flickered in the distance, and the stars above seemed so far away, just like the life I had once known.
But I was going to make it. I had to. I had no other choice.
For Lucas.
I let out a long breath, feeling the weight on my chest finally begin to loosen.

They let me know that they replaced every single component in the machine, making it more akin to a new ENA 8 than a used one. And now it works like a dream. The grinding even sounds completely different than it used to. An indication that it was crapping out for a while. I make about 4 cups a day and they let me know that it had done about 6500 cups.

The fact remains though that within the next 2 years, I want to replace it with a new one. I’m thinking of the Z10 for the cold brew feature, but I’m really not sure.

I am 22F, I live at home, and I commute to college for undergrad. I am the youngest and the only one still at home. My relationship with my mom has gotten to a point where I feel genuinely trapped, and I am not sure how to handle it or whether talking to her would make anything better.

I feel as if I am only “allowed” to go to class and go to the gym. Anytime I leave for anything else, like studying at a coffee shop, dog sitting, or visiting my sister, I am met with coldness, guilt trips, the silent treatment, or heavy questioning. It leaves me feeling like I have done something wrong even when I haven’t. My mom is retired and never leaves the house, so everything I do gets examined or questioned.

I am a straight-A student. I do not drink, party, smoke, or get into trouble. The only thing I can imagine she is worried about is me seeing a guy or dating, but I am 22 and feel like that should not be treated as something forbidden.

A recent example: last weekend I spent the day dog sitting. When I got home, my mom asked why I “had makeup on” even though I wasn’t wearing any. She came up to me and physically touched my eyelashes to check. It felt invasive and humiliating. Even if I had been wearing mascara, why would that matter.

Part of why this hurts so much goes deeper. I came forward about SA that happened to me between ages 14–16 when I was 17. I sometimes wonder if she believes she is protecting me by questioning everything I do or everywhere I go. But it does not feel protective. It feels suffocating. Her fear has become my restriction, and I am the one paying the emotional price.

I know my mom (and dad) are not emotionally healthy people, but sometimes I wonder if she genuinely has no idea how much this is hurting me. I have never confronted her because she taught me very early on to keep the peace even if my mental health was the price. I am torn between bringing it up or just trying to set boundaries quietly.
On top of all of this, I want to add that I am not planning to move out immediately. Financially, it makes the most sense for me to stay at home until I get into medical school, so I am trying to find ways to cope and set boundaries in the meantime rather than rushing to move out right now.
I feel increasingly isolated. I do not really have friends anymore, and after being in this environment for so long, I honestly do not know how to make them. It is starting to bleed into school as well. I feel like an outlier among other students, and it is breaking my heart each class 💔 

How do I set boundaries or cope while still living at home? 

TLDR: I am 22F living at home. My mom questions or guilt-trips me whenever I leave for anything besides school or the gym, and I feel trapped. I came forward about SA as a teen, and I think she believes she is protecting me, but it feels suffocating instead. I want to stay home until medical school for financial reasons, so I need advice on boundaries and coping strategies.",3,1763327953.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

1oyxgjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1oyxgjh/aita_by_going_nuclear_response_by_going_no/,AITA by going nuclear response (by going no contact with a 'non-committal' friend) following a spat,"Hopefully this won't be too boring, but is I (36/M)  have a few conditions, particularly ADHD, Autism and I am particularly prone to rejection dysphoria, as a result of social awkwardness etc I've pretty much given on friendship and you can forget relationships up until my thirties. For most this isn't that evident but its bad enough I need to job hop every few years once people start picking up on my quirks.

  
Anyway, I tried getting into dating and after a lot of no-goes I matched with a girl who is amazing - mature, intelligent, but most of all very understanding. We talked for months, we called each other and she even became prone to falling asleep on the phone at 2am once we'd run out of things to say, and this became regular. We talked about meeting up but due to a personal issue (disability discrimination at work) we just never did - we still bonded really well and talked hours daily but we just never progressed.

I wasn't too upset about this, as I was happy to just have a strong friend, girlfriend would be nice but friendship was a good thing, but over time I started feeling frustrated because I would often give her support - she felt lonely - she had her own job problems and lost her own circle of friends - she needed to get out of the house and talk to people and no matter how much I gently nudged I could not get her to agree to go to a coffee - I even worked in the city she lived, three minutes from where she worked but it was just never convenient.

This went on for about a year, intense calls, more interaction than you'd expect even in a relationship but never anything more - no hiking, no coffee visit, no invites nothing at all you'd do with friends, and I became conscious I was becoming less of a friend and more of a therapist. I was on the phone because I was good to talk to, understanding of lifes problems - but I started to feel I was absolutely no good for anything like....going bowling.

  
I pushed this concern down in favour for the mutual support we were giving each other, but this week she fell out of with me because I cracked a bit of a joke which usually lands well but for some reason didn't. The joke was minor she had just done some DIY, it hadn't gone well and she was showing me (in her words the disaster)  and I turned it into a limerick - and then I made another. It wasn't a big spat and we didn't argue much but I got a bit told off and I did back off, but then I decided to go NC with her - don't ask me why but something just snapped and I felt like I'd lost nearly years effort on a friend that didn't even see me as worth a coffee - but would be on tap to talk about lifes woes. I went about things badly, I didn't raise the matter (I once asked why we didn't progress and it got weird) but I did something I always do when stressed and killed my phone, instant messengers and went off grid for a few days - found out today found she'd blocked me everywhere so no going back now.

I hate to admit it as near 40 year old corporate worker - but I am heartbroken - last intense friendship was back in high school and I am absolutely torn by 'starting things' by going NC, but I'm also torn because in the back of my mind I did feel I was being used - I think we could have spent years chatting and never as much as met. Then i feel torn because is it inappropriate to make the expectation to do activities with friends, let alone potential relationships?

In my head I think I had to end it, in my heart I feel destroyed - I know in real world terms this is not anyone's idea of catastrophe but I've done so much and spent so much time with her . Either way it's gone now.  AITA for stopping engaging? I know my method wasn't very good.

1oyxdr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1oyxdr3/aio_by_avoiding_my_coworker_whose_bf/,AIO by avoiding my coworker whose bf propositioned me for sex?,"So I (22F) just started at a new job a few months ago. I’m a recent grad and the position is a temporary (1 year) position where I’m placed at a company. It’s a similar program to Teach For America or City Year, but I’m not placed in a school. I share an office with Jess (25F) who joined the company through the exact opportunity I’m doing now. She and I have become friends. She has a boyfriend named Jake (25M) and my boyfriend is named Carter (24M). Jake and Carter have become friends as we’ve done some double dates together.

Unfortunately, Carter cheated on me about 2 months ago. It’s been a slow break up as I’m on the waitlist for government subsidized/affordable housing, but we are amicable. Jess and Jake know about the break up. 

Jess invited me to her Halloween party 2 weeks ago. At the Halloween party, Jake was talking about setting up one of his female friends with his male friend. I jokingly asked “when do I get set up?” At this point, Jake turned to Jess and asked “what about the shower conversation?” When I asked what this was about, they said “don’t worry about it.” I was a little confused but shrugged it off, assuming it was unrelated. 

Later that night Jake and I were alone as I was going to sleep on their couch and Jess had gone to sleep. Jake says to me “hey, look at this” and shows me a text message from Jess that says “I don’t care if you have sex with OP.” He explains that they are in an open relationship and asks if I’m interested. I immediately said “I don’t think I’m comfortable with that since I know Jess so well.” He received the response well. I asked him if this was what the shower conversation was and he said “yes.” 

Carter and I have an agreement that while we are living together, we won’t be with other people and will keep each other informed about anything romantic or sexual. He texted me while I was at the Halloween party and asked how it was going. I told him what happened because I knew I had to eventually and felt weird pretending that everything was normal.
Carter started freaking out and blowing up my phone and Jake’s. He was cussing Jake out as apparently he had told Jake that he was trying to work it out with me the day before.

I immediately left the party and avoided talking to Jess the rest of the weekend. On Monday, we agreed to get coffee before work and discuss what happened. I told her I was really uncomfortable with being propositioned. She explained to me that she has some kind of medical condition that makes sex painful for her and while she’s undergoing treatment, they are open. 

She claims that she told him in the shower that she didn’t like the idea of him propositioning me bc I’m “like her little sister” but that she can’t control him. She made a bunch of weird statements like “it’s sad bc nobody is in the wrong and it’s all a big misunderstanding” and “I don’t know why Jake asked you because he doesn’t find you attractive.” 

I found all of those comments plus the whole situation really weird and disconcerting. I talked to my mom about it and she advised that I just try and avoid her since Jess is more established in the job and even my supervisor through the program I’m working knows Jess and keeps in touch with her. Jess seems to think everything should go back to normal and keeps asking me to do things outside of work. Am I overreacting by thinking the relationship is too damaged to move past?

TLDR: My coworker is in an open relationship and thinks it’s no big deal that her bf propositioned me for sex. Now she wants to keep hanging out. Am I overreacting by avoiding her?

# Journal Entry — June 3rd, 2024 — 8:42 p.m.

If anything ever happens to me, I want there to be a record—my own words, unpolished and unedited. Maybe this is dramatic, or maybe it’s just nerves from starting over my entire life. Still, something inside me insists I track everything, beginning to end. Today I moved into a new apartment. A new chapter, a new season. I keep telling myself I’m shedding my old skin the way trees shed their blossoms in spring—messy, but hopeful. I’m exhausted from the move, but also relieved to finally have a space of my own. The exhaustion lingers, but so does a small, growing sense of comfort. I think this place could finally feel like mine. —Nora

  


The first thing I noticed about Oregon wasn’t the green—everyone talks about the green—but the *weight* of the air. The sky here sits low, almost like it’s trying to rest its chin on the rooftops. When I stepped out of the rideshare with my last suitcase, the wind smelled faintly of moss and cold metal, as if rain were always waiting just behind the clouds.

I stood on the curb for a moment, staring up at the apartment complex. Hollow Creek Residences. The building was simple: beige siding, forest-green trim, balconies dotted with plants, a few wind chimes that moved even when the air was still. 

The manager, Mr. Halstrom, met me at the bottom of the stairs. He looked like he was built out of rectangles—square shoulders, square jaw, square glasses, even a square patch where his hair refused to grow. His voice rumbled like distant thunder.

“You must be Nora,” he said, shaking my hand with both of his. “Welcome to Hollow Creek. If you need anything—maintenance, parking adjustments, replacement keys—my office is the one with the orange doormat. Hard to miss.”

“Thank you,” I said. “I’m just glad to be here.”

“Well,” he nodded, “people usually are, at first. The rain chases some away, but others find it… comforting.” He tilted his head. “Which type are you?”

“I guess we’ll see.”

He laughed, a single booming note, and helped me haul my boxes up the stairs to Unit 2 B.

Inside, the apartment greeted me with the scent of new paint and empty cabinets. The walls glowed with morning light; the carpeting felt smooth and beige beneath my feet. A tiny but charming balcony overlooked a hedge of pine. In the living room, all was bare but for the soft hum of the refrigerator and the echo of our footsteps.

“This’ll do nicely,” he said. “Quiet neighbors. The woman next door, Ellie, is very friendly. Works from home most days. I think you two will get along.”

I didn’t know then how important Ellie would become. Or how much trouble that would bring.

He gave me my keys, left me with a final square handshake, and returned downstairs.

Alone in the apartment, I let out a long breath. Relief replaced the tension I hadn’t realized I was holding in my body. My muscles slowly uncoiled—only then did I notice how much I’d been bracing myself for months.

I unpacked for hours. My belongings felt both too sparse and too heavy. Isn’t it strange how life fits into boxes, but splits apart when you try to spread it out? I stacked books on the kitchen counter because I didn’t know where the bookshelf should go. I propped my mattress against the wall until I could figure out the bedframe. My plants lined up near the balcony door—little survivors, like me.

But one corner of my bedroom remained stubbornly empty. A slanted angle of the wall is illuminated by the afternoon glow. It somehow looked *hungry*, as if it expected something to fill it. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Just interior-design frustration.

By late afternoon, I heard a soft knock.

When I opened the door, a petite woman with honey-brown curls stood smiling at me. She wore a soft blue sweater, the sleeves pushed up unevenly, and her expression radiated warm, easy energy.

“You must be the new tenant,” she said. “I’m Ellie. I’m your neighbor directly across the hall. I brought coffee because everyone needs caffeine on move-in day.”

She handed me a paper cup with a little heart drawn on the lid.

“Oh,” I said, startled but grateful. “Thank you. I’m Nora. And I absolutely do need this.”

“Thought so.” Ellie peeked past me into the apartment. “Need help unpacking? I’m great at organizing, terrible at assembling furniture, but I can definitely hand you screws and cheer you on.”

“Honestly? Yes. Please.”

She grinned. “Perfect. Let me grab my slippers. My real shoes are a lie.”

Ellie returned a minute later in fuzzy slippers shaped like sleeping foxes.

We unpacked together. I learned bits of her in the way people reveal themselves when their hands are busy. She’d lived here three years. She worked remotely, editing articles for a travel website. She knew every coffee shop within ten miles and which ones had the least pretentious barista. But she also seemed lonely in a way she tried to mask with big smiles and louder laughter. Even as we joked, I recognized the surface cheer hiding a familiar emptiness. Loneliness can spot itself in others like a reflection; feeling this, I shifted from comfort to quiet understanding.

As we arranged my bedroom furniture, Ellie nodded toward the empty corner.

“You planning something there? A reading nook? Plant corner? Shrine to your future successes?”

I sighed. “I don’t know. It feels too empty, but I can’t think of what should go there.”

She tapped her chin dramatically. “Mirror? A big decorative one? This room would look twice as big with one.”

“You think?”

“Oh, totally. And there’s this place downtown—Second Chances. They sell old furniture and restored antiques. Sometimes weird stuff, but fun weird.” She wiggled her eyebrows. “Want to check it out? I can drive.”

I hesitated. I’d barely moved in. But the idea of filling that corner, of settling the room properly, tugged at me.

“Sure,” I said. “Let me grab my wallet.”

Ellie clapped her hands. “Adventure.”

We left the apartment as the sky dimmed toward evening. In Oregon, dusk appears as if someone has dipped the world in watercolor—soft blues blend into purples. Building edges blur beneath settling clouds.

In Ellie’s car, she talked the whole way, her voice bouncing between topics.

“So what brought you here?” she asked.

“A fresh start,” I said simply.

She glanced at me. “Running from something or running toward something?”

“Maybe both.”

She nodded like she understood. “Same.”

We pulled up to Second Chances, a wide, dimly lit storefront with mismatched lamps in the window and a bell above the door that sounded like it had smoked for most of its life.

Inside, the air smelled of old wood, dust, and lemon polish. Warm but patchy lighting left pockets of shadow. In those shadows, tall wardrobes loomed like silent sentries. Every piece of furniture seemed to have a story, even if the stories never actually happened.

“Isn’t this place great?” Ellie said, spinning slowly to take it in.

“It’s… something,” I murmured. It felt like a museum of forgotten lives.

We wandered past shelves of trinkets and towering armoires until Ellie stopped so abruptly I bumped into her.

“There,” she whispered, pointing.

Against the far wall, half-caught in the glow of a mismatched lamp, stood a tall, antique mirror. Its frame was dark walnut, carved with curling floral designs and slightly uneven, giving it a handcrafted feel. The glass was clean, but the reflection looked deeper than it should have, as if I might fall forward into it instead of just seeing a copy of myself.

Ellie nudged me. “That. That is the mirror for your room.”

I stepped closer. My reflection stared back—tired, hair a mess from moving, dark circles under my eyes—but the glass softened me, as if it forgave my exhaustion.

“It’s beautiful,” I said.

“And perfect,” she added. “Let’s get it.”

A man in a green flannel appeared beside us. I swear he moved too silently for someone wearing heavy boots.

“Interested?” he asked.

“Yes,” Ellie said immediately.

“I… think so,” I added.

He smiled, but his eyes didn’t. “It’s an old piece. Hand-carved. Came in a few weeks ago.”

“Do you know where it came from?” I asked.

He shrugged. “Estate sale. The usual. But it’s sturdy. Good craftsmanship. Most people don’t make things like this anymore.”

I nodded, running my fingers along the carved wood. It felt warm, as if it had been sitting in sunlight even though this part of the shop was dim.

Ellie bounced on her toes. “We’ll take it.”

The man wrapped it carefully in quilted pads and helped carry it to her car. The mirror barely fit diagonally across the backseat.

As we drove home, I kept glancing at it in the rearview mirror. The surface caught bits of passing headlights, stretching them into long streaks as if they were being pulled inward.“You’re going to love it,” Ellie said. “It’s going to make your room feel alive.”

“Alive,” I echoed quietly. A strange word choice, but I didn’t mention it.

When we got back to the apartment, we carried the mirror upstairs—carefully, slowly—and placed it in the corner of my bedroom. It fit the space perfectly. Almost too perfectly, like the corner had been waiting for it.

Ellie exhaled dramatically. “Ugh, look at that. A masterpiece.”

“It does look good,” I admitted.

“Text me if you need anything tonight,” she said. “If you get lonely or spooked or whatever. I’m right across the hall.”

“I will. Thank you.”

She smiled, warm and sincere. “Welcome home, Nora.”

After she left, I stared at the mirror longer than I meant to. My reflection stood quietly, tired and small. Something in the image felt… expectant. I shook it off. Moving fatigue. Too much coffee. Too much emotion for one day.

I brushed my teeth, crawled into bed, and listened to the soft Oregon rain finally starting to fall. It tapped gently against the window like fingertips drumming a lullaby.

The mirror is in place now. The room feels balanced. Strange how one object can settle everything. I’m exhausted, but in a good way. I’ll write more tomorrow—my eyes won’t stay open. Nothing weird to report. Just rain and quiet and the sense that I’ve done something right today. For once. —Nora

  
  


# PART TWO

# JOURNAL ENTRY — June 18th, 2024 — 9:42 PM

The apartment still smells faintly of paint and sawdust, like the place itself is trying to pretend it’s newer than it is. I’m not sure if that’s comforting or deceitful. I’m writing tonight because the mirror feels… wrong. Not overtly—nothing dramatic enough to sound sane when put on paper—but off, like a song almost on beat but not quite.

Last night, I swore the reflection lagged a fraction of a second when I walked past it. It was the kind of delay you’d blame on a bad video call. I stood there afterward, watching myself breathe, telling myself I was imagining things. I’ve been stressed. Exhausted. Moving does that.

I haven’t told Ellie. She’d just laugh and say I need actual sleep.

Still… something feels strange. Maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m overreacting.

But writing it down makes me feel like I’m anchoring myself to something real.

—Nora



I had almost forgotten about the weird feeling around the mirror. Almost.

The morning light came in pale and slanted, filtered through clouds that never fully lifted in June. Oregon summer always takes its time arriving. The air smelled like damp pavement and someone’s distant laundry detergent. I made coffee, sat on the couch, and told myself I’d get used to living alone again. That I just needed a routine.

But the mirror kept pulling at the corner of my attention.

It didn’t help that every time I walked past my bedroom door, I caught myself glancing inside—not fully on purpose, not fully by accident. It was as if my eyes were checking for something before I had time to think about what.

I avoided the mirror for the first few days. Not intentionally, not as a rule—just the way someone avoids a sour memory. Every time I nearly caught my reflection, I felt a little pinch inside my ribs, like my body wanted to warn me before my mind understood why.

Everything else in the apartment felt normal. The pipes clanked at predictable hours. The creaky stairwell outside my door kept its same old rhythm, like an elderly dog pacing up and down the hallway. Mrs. Harrington watered her plants on the balcony and waved at me even if we made eye contact for only half a second. Familiarity was settling in.

But the mirror was the one unfamiliar thing, the one object that didn’t seem to belong to the apartment or to me. It felt like a guest that hadn’t been invited, sitting too close, listening too intently.

Ellie showed up mid-afternoon wearing a yellow raincoat even though it wasn’t raining. She said it “felt like rain,” and sometimes in Oregon that’s enough reason to carry one.

“Noraaa,” she sing-songed as she knocked twice and then twice again, her signature rhythm. “Open up—your favorite person is here!”

“You weren’t invited,” I joked as I let her in.

She strutted inside anyway, plopping onto my couch with the confidence of someone who had purchased it herself.

“I brought you pastries,” she said, holding out a small bakery box. “You looked like you needed sugar last time.”

I rolled my eyes. “I don’t *look* like I need sugar.”

“You always look like you need sugar,” she said. Then, squinting. “Also… sleep. And possibly therapy.”

“That’s just my face,” I muttered.

She laughed, her voice bright enough to push the shadows in my apartment back a few inches.

We talked for an hour—about her new coworker (“*He smells like arrogance and expensive cologne*”), about her cat’s recent vet visit, and about whether or not I was adjusting. She asked to see the mirror again.

“You haven’t decorated around it yet,” she said. “It needs a plant. Or maybe fairy lights. Or—OMG—we should put one of those vintage scarves over the corner, dramatic fortune-teller vibes—”

“I don’t want anything over it,” I said too quickly. I felt the stiffness in my voice right away.

She blinked. “O-kay, mysterious,” she teased. “I didn’t know your mirror had boundaries.”

I forced a smile. “It just looks better clean.”

“Well,” she said, clapping her hands together, “let’s get you out of this weird mood. Fresh air. Walk. Now.”

And because Ellie has the emotional force of a very cheerful tornado, I let her drag me outside.

That night, alone in the apartment again, I noticed it for the second time.

I stepped into my bedroom to set my phone on the charger, and as I passed the mirror, my reflection… hesitated.

Not much. Not dramatically. A sliver of a second, just long enough for my heart to roll over in my chest like a startled animal.

I froze. Slowly, I lifted my right hand.

My reflection followed.

But the lag—subtle as a whisper—was there.

I stood staring at it for too long. My eyes watered from not blinking. My breath stuttered.

When I stepped away, the reflection seemed to finish the motion a hair late, as if it were adjusting into place.

I backed out of the room.

All night I kept telling myself I’d miss. The human brain invents motion in stillness, fills in gaps, and tricks itself.. That I was just tired.

But the seed of dread had already been planted somewhere deep—like a thorn under skin you can’t reach.

I didn’t sleep well. Every dream felt like walking through fog with someone’s footprints appearing just behind mine.

The next morning, I put a blanket over the mirror.

I didn’t plan to. I didn’t even think about it. I was brushing my teeth when I saw the corner of the mirror through the doorway and felt my stomach twist. I grabbed the nearest thing—an old navy-blue throw blanket—and thumbtacked it across the frame.

It wasn’t graceful. Or even a good solution. But I felt better immediately, as if a wound had been covered.

Ellie stopped by later that evening to bring me soup because she decided I “sounded weird over text.”

She wandered into my room and stood there staring at the covered mirror.

“Nora,” she said, “did you seriously put a blanket over your very fancy antique mirror? Where’s the aesthetic? The drama?”

“It’s temporary,” I said.

“Why?”

I shrugged. “Just didn’t feel like looking at myself lately.”

Ellie’s face softened. “If it’s that depression thing again—”

“It’s not depression,” I said quickly.

“You sure?”

“I’m fine,” I lied. “Just tired.”

She accepted it without pushing. That’s the thing about Ellie—she can read people, but she doesn’t pry unless you ask her to.

She patted my arm. “Okay. But if you start covering other reflective surfaces, I’m staging an intervention.”

I laughed. It felt stiff in my throat.

I went to bed feeling more at ease than I had in days.

The blanket over the mirror helped. It made the room feel more normal, like I had shut something out. I fell asleep quickly.

I don’t know what woke me—maybe the wind rattling the balcony railing, maybe my own heartbeat, maybe something else entirely.

When I opened my eyes, the room was dim, lit only by the soft blue of the streetlamp outside.

And the blanket was gone.

Not fallen.

Not on the floor.

It was folded. Neatly. Precisely. Sitting on the edge of the bed, like someone had prepared it for the morning.

My breath caught. For a moment, I couldn’t even move.

The mirror stood uncovered across the room, reflecting my small, trembling shape sitting up in bed.

I stared into it.

My reflection stared back.

But I couldn’t shake it—the sense that it had been awake longer than I had.

I didn’t want to write this, but I have to. The blanket came off the mirror. Not just came off—someone folded it. I can’t explain that. I don’t know how to make that make sense.

Maybe I’m sleepwalking. Maybe I’m stressed. Maybe my brain is trying to tell me something.

But the mirror is uncovered now.

And I swear—when I looked at it tonight—I wasn’t alone in the room.

I don’t know what to do. But writing it down makes me feel less like I’m slipping.

Like stepping outside in the morning and the weather is exactly right. Not too hot, not freezing, just that clean, calm air that wakes you up properly. Or when someone lets me merge in traffic without acting like it’s a personal insult.

Even the smell of fresh coffee in the morning can flip my mood instantly. Sometimes I don’t even need to drink it, just that first smell feels like a tiny reset button.

And then there are those random moments: finding a free checkout lane, hearing a song I like by accident, or getting a small unexpected bit of good luck.

It made me realize that most of the time, it’s these tiny, almost forgettable moments that make the biggest difference.

I've been doing crosswords for many years of my life, since way before computers and whatnot, and have always enjoyed them.  Something about grabbing the morning paper and having my coffee while doing the daily crossword and word jumble.  It was just such a good routine.  I managed to change with the times, I mean things were much better when newspapers changed to soy ink instead of that old stuff that got all over everything.  Technology, man it was great! (Who'd have thunk: soy ink...)

Fast forward a few years (or many I suppose) and computers and tablets became common place.  Mice and keyboards abounded and you could see just about anything on your computer/tablet.  But not do.  And filling in crosswords using a keyboard and having to select direction each time just didn't have the same relaxing effect as having a nice piece of paper to write on.  So, I wrote off doing crosswords on a computer/tablet for many years.

Fast forward to today.  I recently decided that I wanted a tablet I could use for handwriting and so be able to quickly jot down notes I needed to remember things that needed remembering.  And I took a look at the latest e-ink offerings from the likes of Remarkable, Boox, Kindle, etc.  I settled on a Boox Note Air 5C but that's not what's important.

What was important was that I could do crossword puzzles on it.  With a stylus.  And it felt so close to actual handwriting!  When you write the ink flows immediately on the screen.  The screen isn't smooth glass so you get a bit of resistance as you write and your lines can be as thick or thin as you like.  Response is almost immediate and you can erase as well if you wish.  This is the closest thing to doing crosswords on paper that I've ever found.  So close that it has replaced newspapers for me and I can still sit down with a cup of coffee and feel like I'm holding an actual paper in my hands.  I love it!

The crosswords I'm doing right now are 15x15 grids and are in .pdf format.  I download them direct from the device or from my PC and then copy it over.   Easy stuff.  And easy to load up a few weeks of puzzles in one go.  (I do a few every day)

Anyway, while the tech isn't perfect, it has reached a point where I am very happy with doing my puzzles the old fashioned way, by writing, but on my tablet.  I can cozy up in a nice chair and practice my lower case letters!  Good times!

The airflow is smooth, the hit feels consistent, and the flavour doesn’t get muted like some other high-puff devices. Build quality feels solid too — nothing loose, no leaking so far.

Flavours I’ve come across:
• Blue Razz Ice
• Pineapple Mango Ice
• Peach Ice
• Triple Mango
• Kiwi Passion Fruit Guava
• Cola Ice
• Watermelon Ice
• Coffee Ice
• Kiwi Pineapple Ice
• Strawberry Watermelon

I picked mine up for ₹1500, which I thought was decent considering how long it’s lasting. It’s rated at 50k puffs, and while I’m not counting every drag, it definitely holds up longer than the usual disposables.

Not trying to hype it up or anything — just sharing my experience in case someone else was curious about this model. So far, it’s been a reliable daily use option for me.

So anyways, I (18F) have not been going to family events like birthdays or just simple get togethers for about a year now, but I attend Christmas, Easter, basically every holiday simply because I wish to celebrate that with some of my family members, but in order to do that I have to attend all family events to see them. 

Now to the problem: I feel very uncomfortable whenever the whole family is there simply because I am always judged. I also get overstimulated and overwhelmed very fast. 

What made me decide not to attend events like birthdays or just get togethers is this: at Christmas one year ago we were eating at a restaurant on December 26th, as the Christmas celebrations last three days in my country. We ate, everything was fine and then we went to my aunts house for cake and coffee. At her house everything was normal until I took off my zip up hoodie, my grandmother and aunt launched into a 10 minute talk of how I was too skinny and that I looked like a Skeleton and what not, now some people might say that it’s not too bad, but I have struggled with an ED, my parents found out early and didn’t let it get critical, I am very thankful for that. But I was very underweight and still am, so Idk why but it still hurt yk? I shook it off and went on about the day.

Some time later I noticed that my hair was tangled so I went to my bag and pulled out my hairbrush to brush my hair, my little cousin (10F) then noticed that I had a lipstick and a lipgloss in my bag, so she asked why I had it. I told her that I had it with me because sometimes I need to redo it if the lipstick I was wearing got smudged or faded. Then my aunt berated me that I wouldn’t need it and that the brush was unnecessary, but everyone in my family knows how Irritated I become if my hair is tangled or strainy. Then she turned to my cousin and said and I quote „please never become like that“ and I was just like huh? You have a problem with me brushing my hair and having lipstick with me? 

My eldest cousin (39M) then went to defending me saying that there is nothing wrong with me having a hairbrush and lipstick with me. That made me feel more at ease. 

I then went to my mother and told her in her mothertongue, that I wanted to leave. She understood and told my dad in her language as he learned it for her a couple years prior. An hour later we left and because I was so overstimulated that I put my earphones in and didn’t talk the whole ride home. When we got home I immediately changed into comfortable clothes, took of make up and jewelry, put my hair up and went to bed. Since then I have not attended a single birthday, I didn’t attend this years Easter either. And I don’t celebrate my birthday with family either. A lot family members have asked my parents why I didn’t attend and my parents just answered „because she dosen‘t want to“ because I said they can tell them the truth if they ask.

I thought ive gotten over my ED but ive noticed something lately

i dont know why… but every time i eat… i end up having a bit of like 20 different things and end up feeling awful… both mentally in terms of self control and physically because i believe this affects my digestion…

i can never seem to have just one meal composed of a few ingredients and call it…. instead there’s this feeling desperation to have little amounts of so many different foods…

for example: if i decide to have 2 fried eggs with a coffee for breakfast… what ends up happening is… i drink half my coffee black with a date… the other half with milk and honey … i have one egg with half a slice of sourdough… the other with a rice cake… a bite of dark chocolate… then i use the other half of the sourdough with some butter and jam to finish my coffee with it… then i feel like i need something salty and have a quarter of a slice of cheese… and then i take a fee sips of coconut water… and it just feels like total chaos by the end… it’s a bit shameful… and i feel like the only thing allowing me to do this is the comfort of living alone…

sure i didnt eat anything ‘bad’ but some form of this happens almost every time i sit down to eat and i dont know why… and there’s so much guilt afterwards because i feel like i should be able to have a normal meal… and also i feel like it is my actions that have been contributing to my poor gut health…

has anyone struggled with/experienced something like this? and does anyone have some helpful advice?

i feel like this may do with not being able to make a choice and stick with it because im not confident in any choice i make.. ",1,1763327140.0,EatingDisorders,2,1.0,False

I have a $2K hard ceiling and, at least on cursory research, Profitec Pro 300 is a solid start. 

For background we do have an old commercial Astoria CMA we Frankensteined to work at home but it's a pain in the ass. The novelty has worn off, I want my space back, but I don't want to give up on having a machine. 

While looking at the Profitec Pro 300 I spotted a refurbished pro 500 that's quite a bit cheaper than the 300 new. I looked up what the differences are and it looks like people prefer the 300 for... I don't exactly understand why. It devolves into technic gobbledygook (for me) pretty quickly. 

So first question is - do people have experience with buying refurbished machines from Clive Coffee and has it been positive? 

Second question is - is there any reason buying a Pro 500 would be worse than a Pro 300 for someone coming in blind? Neither my husband nor I are total novices, I worked as a barista for a well-regarded shop back in the day, but the landscape has changed substantially since then. I'd like a machine that can allow me to get fiddly with it but don't know what features are actually worth it or not. Like someone was trying to sell me on flow control, but I've also heard it's not worth the expense unless you're real particular because everyone sort of defaults to the same profile. 

I'm also open to other suggestions. $2K is my hard ceiling but if I spend less, that opens up the door to getting a better grinder sooner. I have a serviceable Rocky grinder right now that could hold us over for that upgrade. ",1,1763327044.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’ve wanted to for a long time, but I guess I’ve kind of been saving it for a rainy day. Anyway I teach high school and a lot of my students have been going crazy over Welcome to Derry, and a brand new Barnes and Noble just opened near my girlfriends house in Austin, and it seemed like a perfect storm for me to finally dive into IT. 

Normally when I pick up a King book I cruise through them. His books are the easiest for me to binge, I’ve read through a handful of them in one sitting. Starting IT this morning felt no different until about 50 pages in I got to the Six Phone Calls chapter, and I’ve been reading it for nearly four hours now. Stanley’s portion was incredibly disturbing and I was blown away by the emotion in it, and then everything after that I’ve been slogging through. I loved the Ben portion but even then I kept setting the book down to check my phone, watch a minute of football, make a coffee, etc.

I guess I’m making this post because I want to know from some of the IT community if this chapter is difficult for everyone to get through the first time, or if this is a sign that IT may not be my favorite. I’m gonna finish it because I see it as a King essential and I spent good money on it, but I’m kind of wondering if I should re-set my expectations and if this is a sign that IT might not be for me, or if this is a common experience and I can get excited for what comes next when I finish the chapter. 

I don’t know anyone personally who has read the book other than my uncle who read it when he was a kid so I figured this would be a good place to ask.

1oyx26o,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1oyx26o/aita_for_needing_emotional_support_during/,AITA for needing emotional support during marriage counseling when my husband secretly recorded me and played it at Thanksgiving dinner in front of our entire family?,"I had sex with my affair partner in the therapist's parking lot after every marriage counseling session for six months and my husband showed dashcam footage of it to both our families at Thanksgiving dinner.

I brought him to counseling as my emotional support person. That's what I told my husband when he asked why this guy from my book club needed to sit in our sessions. The therapist said it was unconventional but if it helped me feel safe sharing my feelings, she'd allow it.

My husband looked confused but he agreed. He always agreed to everything back then.

The affair started four months before I suggested counseling. Met him at a actual book club, not making that up. My husband worked late constantly, I was bored, and this guy paid attention to me. Basic story. We started texting, then meeting for coffee, then hotel rooms during lunch breaks.

But I got paranoid. My husband isn't stupid. He's a software engineer, detail oriented, notices everything. So I figured if I was already sleeping with someone, why not get my husband to pay for therapy to fix our marriage while I kept doing it. Genius move, right?

Wrong.

The therapy sessions were Tuesday evenings. I'd pick up my affair partner, we'd go together, sit through an hour of my husband talking about feeling disconnected while this guy held my hand for support. The therapist ate it up. She kept saying how wonderful it was that I had someone helping me feel secure enough to be vulnerable.

After each session, my husband would hug me in the parking lot and say he loved me. Then he'd leave in his car. I'd wait exactly three minutes. Then my affair partner and I would have sex in my car. Sometimes in the backseat, sometimes I'd climb on top of him in the passenger seat. We did this six times. Every single session.

My husband gave me that car for our tenth anniversary eight months ago. Pearl white SUV with leather seats and a backup camera. He said he wanted me to have something reliable and safe.

Turns out it also had a dashcam he installed that saved footage to a cloud account.

He knew everything. Every session. Every time we had sex after. He had dates, timestamps, video evidence. And he waited.

Thanksgiving at his parents' house. Both our families there. His parents, his two brothers and their wives, my parents, my sister. Everyone sitting around after dinner when my husband stands up and says he has something to share.

He pulled out his laptop. Connected it to their TV.

My mom asked if we were announcing a pregnancy. I almost threw up.

He played it all. The footage was clear. You could see my affair partner getting into my car before therapy. You could see us coming back after. Then you could see what happened next. All six sessions. He'd edited it together chronologically with dates and timestamps.

The sound was the worst part. You could hear everything we said. My affair partner talking about how stupid my husband was. Me laughing about how my husband paid for the therapy sessions where I brought my affair partner. Us talking about divorce plans and how much money I'd get.

My dad stood up and walked out without saying anything. My mom started crying. My sister called me a horrible person. His mom was screaming at me. His dad just stared at the TV with his mouth open.

I tried to explain. Tried to say my husband neglected me, that he worked too much, that I was lonely. My affair partner already left out the back door.

My husband finally spoke. He said he gave me that car as an anniversary gift because he loved me and wanted me safe. Said he installed the dashcam for security after there were break ins in our neighborhood. Said he only checked the footage five months ago because he noticed the mileage was off.

Then he said he stayed for six months collecting evidence because his lawyer told him to document everything for the divorce. He went to every therapy session knowing exactly what would happen after. Sat there listening to me talk about our problems while holding another man's hand. Hugged me goodbye knowing what came next.

He filed for divorce the day before Thanksgiving. Served me papers that morning before we left for his parents' house. I thought we were just going to dinner. He planned the whole thing.

My parents won't talk to me. My sister blocked my number. I'm staying at a hotel because my husband got a restraining order. His lawyer is using the video evidence to argue against alimony. My affair partner stopped answering my calls.

Everyone is saying I'm a monster. That I deserved this. That what my husband did was justified.

But he humiliated me in front of everyone we know. He could have just divorced me privately. He didn't have to destroy my entire life and relationships with my family.

So was I wrong or is everyone overreacting to what my husband did?

for example: if i decide to have 2 fried eggs with a coffee for breakfast… what ends up happening is… i drink half my coffee black with a date… the other half with milk and honey … i have one egg with half a slice of sourdough… the other with a rice cake… a bite of dark chocolate… then i use the other half of the sourdough with some butter and jam to finish my coffee with it… then i feel like i need something salty and have a quarter of a slice of cheese… and then i take a fee sips of coconut water… and it just feels like total chaos by the end… it’s a bit shameful… and i feel like the only thing allowing me to do this is the comfort of living alone… 

sure i didnt eat anything ‘bad’ but some form of this happens almost every time i sit down to eat and i dont know why… and there’s so much guilt afterwards because i feel like i should be able to have a normal meal… and also i feel like it is my actions that have been contributing to my poor gut health…

I am 22F, I live at home, and I commute to college for undergrad. I am the youngest and the only one still living at home, and it has been taking a huge toll on me. My home environment is wearing me down to the point where it is getting harder and harder to stay focused on the future I want.

I feel as if I am only allowed to go to class and go to the gym. Anywhere else I go is met with coldness, guilt trips, the silent treatment, heavy questioning, and this overwhelming feeling that I have done something wrong. It genuinely feels like I cannot leave the house without facing consequences for it. Even something as simple as studying at a coffee shop or hanging out at my sister’s apartment gets treated like a crime when I come home. It hurts more than I know how to explain.

This is not new, but the cumulative effects are catching up to me. My mom is retired and never leaves the house, so everything I do gets questioned. It feels like anything and everything I do must get her approval first. I'm a straight A, responsible student and I don't drink/party/smoke so the only thing I can even imagine she is worried about is me seeing a guy or dating, but I am 22 and that should not feel forbidden.

For example, last weekend I spent the day dog sitting. When I got home, she asked why I had makeup on in a tone like she had uncovered something. I told her I was not wearing any makeup, and she had to physically touch my eyelashes to check. 

I'm a premed student which is far from easy, but dealing with all of this at home makes everything feel a hundred times harder. I keep telling myself that one day I will look back and be thankful that I pushed through it or that maybe everything happens for a reason, but right now its becoming increasingly difficult to hold onto that hope. 

A part of this goes even deeper too. I came forward about SA that occurred between the ages of 14-16 when I was 17 years old. Sometimes I wonder if my mom thinks she is protecting me by questioning everything I do or everywhere I go, but she does not realize she is doing the opposite. It feels like her fear has become my restriction and I am the one carrying all the weight of it which is suffocating.  

I know my mom (and dad) are not emotionally healthy people, but sometimes I wonder if she has no idea just how much this is hurting me. I've never told her because she's conditioned me well over the years to keep the peace even when my mental health is the expense. Part of me wonders if I should bring it up or if it would only make everything worse. I genuinely do not know how to handle it.

I feel so alone. I do not really have friends and after being in this environment for so long, I honestly do not know how to make them anymore. It is starting to bleed into school too. I feel like an outlier among other students, like everyone else knows how to connect and I am just stuck in this isolated bubble. It is destroying me and breaking my heart.

If anyone has been through something similar or has advice on coping while still living at home, I would really appreciate it. I know there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but right now it is incredibly hard to see it. ❤️

**TLDR:** I am 22F and the only sibling left at home. My mom questions, guilt trips, or gets cold anytime I leave the house for anything other than school or the gym. It is affecting my mental health, my relationships, and even school. I came forward about SA at 16 and instead of becoming safer, my world became smaller.

The results have been insane for my focus, consistency and overall progress.

It’s really simple. I started waking up early and using the first hours of my day, and the first energy of my day, on my own goals. Before work, before responsibilities, before the world starts pulling on me.

For context, I’ve been a student, I work 9 to 5, I’ve had family stuff, chores, responsibilities, all of that. So I get it. But instead of waking up at 07:00 to get to work by 09:00, I wake up at 05:30 and give myself 60 to 90 minutes of deep focused work. No phone, no distractions, just silence and focus.

If I wait until after the world has taken the biggest chunks of my energy, then my goals only get the crumbs.

For me it’s coffee, journaling, a quick prayer, and then straight into work that actually moves my life forward. I do it because I want my best energy to go to my goals first, not last.

I’ll put a little extra stuff on my profile to show what my morning routine looks like for anyone interested.

If you struggle with consistency or productivity, try this for a week. The momentum you build is crazy.

I don’t feel like I have to say this, but I’ll mention it anyway. This does not mean you should sacrifice sleep to wake up early. That would be counterproductive. Just go to bed on time and get enough sleep.",10,1763326659.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False

""Spring Blossom Water! The taste of-""



*Whazmlfmmf...*



**WAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOO!**



I was jerked awake by the harsh, warbling siren of the EBS emergency warning.



*Must've fallen asleep in front of the TV…*



**WAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOO!**



A vaguely 1950s sounding voice said, ""This is a real emergency. I repeat, this is a real emergency and not a test.""



I blearily stared into the CRT, incomprehending.



*I can't be hearing that right...the...this isn't a test…*



*Oh god this isn't a test…*



""The President Of The United States has directed that we interrupt our normal program. This is the Emergency Broadcast System-""



*As if I couldn't tell that from the bright red title slide saying ""EBS EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM"" in white lettering!*



""-This is an attack warning from the Department Of Defense. Repeat: This is an attack warning from the Department Of Defense. Attack warning means that an actual attack against this country has been detected, and that immediate protective action should be taken.""



*Oh fuck oh fuck*



My heart racing, I raced into my apartment's mini-kitchen and grabbed a flashlight from one of the drawers. I hesitated for a second, and grabbed a kitchen knife, a little old paring knife with a tattered wooden handle I'd picked up from a thrift store, from another drawer.



""Follow the instructions of your local government officials. I repeat: Follow the instructions of your local government officials.""



I grabbed my half-eaten Pitstop burger off the coffee table and finished it.



*What's going on? Is it nuclear? Is-*



Another voice, this one sounding sort of muffled, came over the TV.



""This is Governor Thomas Wilson speaking. The United States is currently under assault by unknown forces who have airdropped into many metropolitan centers, large and small-""



*WHAT?!*



""Law enforcement and military forces have engaged these forces, but stragglers may enter your home with the intent to seriously harm you and your family. I would advise all citizens to use lethal force against any intruders-""



**KSSSH!**



*FUCK! Someone broke into the next apartment over through the window!*



Muffled, from the other side of the wall, I could hear…



""What *are* you? W-wait! No! Please!""



And then the sounds…



*Oh God the sounds…*



Hyperventilating because I just heard my neighbor get *murdered*, I looked through the peephole on my front door, knife in trembling hand.



I heard someone or some*thing* kick open their front door, and…



*It's a dude in a lizard costume?*



Then I looked closer.



Those teeth, yellowed like someone who's never seen a toothbrush, stained with blood. The tail, idly whipping back and forth like its *alive*, like its part of the *body*. The bloodstained claws. *The eyes catching the flickering beams of the shitty hall light like a predator's eyes do.*



It was something out of a horror movie.



I have studied costuming.

1oywwoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1oywwoh/thd_recovery_currently_day_2/,THD recovery - currently day 2,"I ended up choosing THD over hemorrhoidectomy and thought I'd log my progress here. Boy, after reading this forum AFTER my surgery I'm starting to worry, it seems everyone who's had THD has had a bad experience and/or a recurrence. Here's hoping I'm an exception. Have people here had it and just not reported back unless they're unhappy, maybe? 

I chose THD because studies showed it to be 80-90% effective (depending which I read), versus the much more painful, much longer recovery surgery being more like 90-95% which didn't seem like enough of an improvement for a much bigger amount of pain and discomfort.

I dealt with internal hemorrhoids for a good few years, just ""living with it"" for far too long and eventually getting banding on all 3 sites earlier this year. That only gave me several weeks of relief (after the last banding) before my symptoms came back.  I was never told what grade they were, but based on my reading of the definitions, I would say they were likely grade 2, with worst case being a 3 (I'll be honest, I didn't do a lot of inspection, taking self photos, etc, but the doc never mentioned protrusions needing to be fixed). In spite of not (knowingly) having problems with protrusion, there was blood in my stool more often than not, and occasionally the leaking / bleeding was really bad - a couple of times getting through my underwear and even my pants unbeknownst to me at the time. How humiliating. I'd often pack TP or tissue back there and wear tighter boxer briefs to hold it in place.

With that as the context, I had my surgery Friday, so 2 days ago now.

Day 0 - day of surgery:

I woke up not even remembering making it to the OR. I was definitely in some discomfort when I woke up, but it wasn't horrible. The hardest part was feeling like I really had to urinate, but being unable to. They gave me a bottle/urinal, and I just could not go.  I drank some juice, had some crackers, drank some water, and still could not go. They said this happens from time to time and if I didn't urinate in 8 hours I should go to the ER.  I got a ride home, traffic was awful, and I felt the whole time like I had to go - but still couldn't right when I got home. A bit later, though, I was able to and oh my goodness the relief was immense - probably more psychologically that physically.

I was given only ibuprofen and acetaminophen for my pain, and they do help a bit but I wouldn't describe any of my time so far as ""pain free"".

In terms of pain on that day, it was tough but not awful. I'd say a 5/10 or so at worst, with the drugs bringing it down to a 2 or 3. However, it was worse especially when I felt gas coming or felt the urge to have a BM that really never came. I was honestly afraid to have a BM because the pain from just the threat of one was pretty tough. I feel like I have an average tolerance for pain, but with 5/10 pain from not actually going I worried about it being 8-9/10 while going.

This is a throwaway account, so I can go full TMI / gross content in case it helps anyone:  I never really fully pooped the first day, but I did have what I guess I'd describe as leakage.  I have a bidet, and even though I wasn't really pooping, the bidet would stimulate a little movement/leakage that definitely also had mucus. The smell was awful - reminded me of the childhood prank fart spray stuff.

I probably made 7-8 trips to the bathroom that night, between napping, resting, TV etc.

Day 1 - first day post surgery:

My pain fluctuated between a 2 and maybe a 6/10 depending on if i'd recently had pain meds. I ate mostly normally, but ended up snacking on things like fruit, etc, instead of having dinner. I had a normal lunch, I had my morning coffee, but I just really didn't feel like dinner. Lots of resting all day, a few minor / minimal BMs - again sort of more like leakage stimulated by the bidet, but it wasn't until later in the day I really ""went"" a little bit.

This day was not fun, but not awful. The pain came and went, and certainly was worse at times, but only ""really bad"" for short periods. I have found that laying on my side is best, but isn't really conducive to watching TV, so I've been watching TV slouched way down to take pressure off of my butt either in bed or on the couch, just putting pillows behind my back/head.

I did feel a lot of pain when on the toilet, and because I had the urge to poop but never really did much, I had to monitor my time and make sure not to strain. Back into TMI territory, my farts were frequent and rank on this day. Wow. I'm sure it has to do with being backed up and stuff, but geez it was bad all day and also in bed / late at night. 

I did eventually poop a bit in the evening. It was a weird combination of pretty tough pain but also relief. I'd say the pain was like an 8/10 during that, but it was mercifully short lived. While it felt like there was some solid BM, there was also enough not, well, the toilet wasn't clear enough to know for sure

I walked back and forth a little more, trying to just stay off of my butt since I didn't want to be on my side all day but also didn't want to be sitting. I'd say my pain when walking was about the same as laying down on my back, not worse, which is good.  It would fluctuate a bit as time went on from taking pain meds.

Day 2 - 2nd day after surgery (today, my day of posting)

I woke up overnight in some pain and discomfort, so I went out to grab some pain meds, took them and went back to bed. Even with meds, the pain today has honestly been worse than days 0 and 1, but still manageable. 

I did have my first solid BM, and holy crap the pain was tough but as with the night before, short lived thankfully. That said, the pain level didn't go down as far after, I'm laying in bed typing this and i'd say I'm feeling about a 4/10 in pain or so despite both laying down and being about an hour out from taking pain meds. I will say it was encouraging (but it's early) that there seemed to be zero blood in either my BM or when I wiped, which is something that hasn't been the case often in the past year.

Today has been a weird combination of improvement and worse pain. It's good to have had a ""normal"" BM and to have a slightly more normal appetite, but so far (about halfway through the day) my pain and discomfort are definitely a bit worse. It's manageable for sure, but definitely unpleasant. I will likely finish watching the football game I'm watching and then roll onto my side and take a nap just to try and escape some of the discomfort.

I've definitely used both my bidet and some time in the shower to comfort myself a bit. Low pressure spray (and being careful trying not to be ""too direct"" for too long) has felt good. I did buy a sitz bath but it feels like a sort of useless purchase I won't use since I have the warm water bidet as a substitute. 

Although today is worse for the pain, I'm not really discouraged or worried about it just yet. It's slightly worse, but it's manageable. I know from past experience that when you're sick or have had surgery things do go up and down a bit, not every single day is always better than the last. 

I'll come back periodically and update, and I'll try to remember to come back several months (or longer) from now and update as well - whether the hemorrhoids come back or not. The scientific studies versus searching this subreddit for ""thd"" are wildly conflicting in terms of success, so I really hope that this holds up and I can be a success story on here for others, but time will tell.",1,1763326522.0,hemorrhoid,0,1.0,False

In my head, I always had this (obviously false) assumption that it'd be watery. The idea of pouring water into brewed espresso just didn't sound good to me.

On the other hand, I'm really not a huge fan of milk-based coffee drinks. I like them okay, but prefer black coffee usually.

Long story short, I decided to make an Americano for the first time today (never even had one before). And...hold on. Let me take another sip.

Oh, man. Rich, syrupy, subtly sweet, with a backend of light acidity. 

The kicker is I'm not even using good beans right now!

I guess this is me, reflecting on my past thickheaded assumptions, urging anyone else who has thought like me to give the Americano a shot.

When I stepped out of the alley, I found myself in a clearing surrounded by a rough ring of pine trees. The sun shone through clouds overhead. Its light fell softly but warmed my body.

I looked behind me to see what I had survived. From the other side, Out was just a brick-lined walkway, a path through the dark. It almost felt welcoming, but I knew I didn’t belong there. Not anymore.

I turned back to look at the clearing surrounding me. It was full of wildflowers and unkempt flower beds with early signs of life. In the middle of the garden stood a small, plain house. It was made of the same white wood so popular in the Square, but its wood was roughly weathered and unevenly painted. It had been lived in. It had survived. A large flutter of butterflies flew around the house in all directions. They weren’t trying to be beautiful. They simply were.

I felt at home in the garden. I had thought I felt at home in Mason County and then, for a moment, in the Square. But this was different. In those places, home was being loved for being exactly what everyone told you to be. It was belonging through obedience. Here, wherever it was, home was being free. Free to do nothing more than breathe. And to be loved anyway.

I felt the screened door to the simple house calling to me. I walked up the stairs kept together with rusty nails. I knocked three times on the door.

One. Two. Three.

Nothing happened. I sighed. I was foolish to expect anything more. No one could live in a place this peaceful.

Then a voice from inside. “One second, hon!” It was the voice of an old, tired woman, but it sounded bright. When the woman opened the door, I knew her instantly. I didn’t yet know her name, but I knew she was a woman who had lived a hard life and yet, somehow, held on to joy. Her long blonde hair was tied in a messy ponytail, and she wore a thin white button-down shirt and torn blue jeans. She wasn’t glamorous. She wasn’t even especially pretty. And her nails and her home were unmanicured. But she was happy.

“Hey there, baby!” she said warmly. She was a person who had never met a stranger. “How do you do?” she reached out her wrinkled hand to shake mine. “I’m Sandra.”

I put my hand in hers and shook unsteadily. I thought I had escaped the Square. I had just entered a new one. Sandra could feel the fear in my pulse. “It’s okay, sweetie.” She patted my hand gently. “If you don’t want to shake, you don’t have to. Hell, you can turn around and leave if you want.” She smiled playfully. She meant those words.

Before I knew what I was doing, I threw myself onto Sandra and hugged her. She had felt my fear but not judged me. She had given me a choice. Sandra put her small arms around me. I was much taller than her four-foot frame.

“Now, now, it’s alright.” Sandra took a step back and placed her hands on my shoulders. “You’re not there anymore. You’re safe.” I stared at her and wiped the tears that had begun to form in my eyes. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions. You wait on the porch and I’ll bring us some coffee.”

Nodding tiredly, I stepped back onto Sandra’s porch and found two weather-eaten rocking chairs. I sat in one and listened to the faint sound of Sandra pouring their coffee. A few minutes later, Sandra walked through the screen door holding a silver coffee service with chipped mugs and a spotted coffee pot. She poured me a cup and sat down in the other rocking chair. She patted my leg with calm firmness.

“Alright,” she said. “Whatcha got?”

I had so many questions. I thought I ought to understand who this was first. “Are you *her*…?”

“Starting with the hard one, huh?” Sandra laughed kindly. “Well, yes. And no.” I held my breath for her next words. “My name is Sandra. The local papers called me Sunny Sandy during my pageant days. That was a *long* time ago.” I thought she was trying to be self-deprecating. I gave her a polite laugh.

“It’s okay, Mikey. I know I’m not that funny.” That made me laugh from my belly. “They called me that because I was always grinning, even when my heels were hurting or the spotlight was in my eyes. My parents were old-fashioned, so they made sure I knew how a good kid was supposed to smile.”

I started to relax. Even if this woman was some strange relative of the Sandy I had just escaped, she knew what my life had been like. It had been her life too.

Sandra continued telling her story. “Well, before you knew it, a talent scout from the big city saw me at one of my pageants. He was real impressed by my talent: my puppet friend Maggie.” My heart hurt as I started to tell Sandra what had happened to her friend. “It’s okay, Mikey,” she said like she had been expecting it. “Sandy and I have been through this day more than a few times by now.”

“So…” I said after listening so far into Sandra’s story. “If *you’re* Sandra Alan, the TV host, what’s…*she*?”

Sandra sighed sadly. “That’s what’s hard to explain, Mikey. She’s…me. Or, part of me.” She could see the confusion in my eyes. “I know that doesn’t make very much sense, but it’s the best I can say. I gave every piece of myself to make *Sunnyside Square*. I didn’t even stay with my Papa after my Mama’s funeral so I could get back to the city for the finale shoot. Me and Papa didn’t talk much after that. Looking back, every time I told myself I wasn’t sad or angry or hurt, I sacrificed more of my life to the show. To the Square.”

“I know the feeling.” I had been doing the same with the campaign.

“One day, I couldn’t do it anymore. My heart just couldn’t take it. I ran away and wound up here. The next day, I tried to go back, but the studio was gone. There was only the Square. When I saw Sandy, I knew what she was. She was what I had become making the show. She was the part of me that wouldn’t let myself be anything but sunny. She told me she could help me be like her. I ended up running back here.”

I could see the resignation in Sandra’s eyes. A sadness that said she deserved that day. “Well, you can come back now, can’t you?” I said hopefully. “I know Mason County would love to see you again. No one’s heard from you in decades.”

“That’s very kind, Mikey,” Sandra said as she gently blew a butterfly off the rim of her coffee cup. “But I can’t. After the Square brought me here…” She couldn’t continue. I didn’t need her to. I knew Sandy had stolen her world.

“Well, can I stay with you?” I thought she needed a friend, but I also didn’t want to face what I had to go back to.

“You can…” Sandra explained. “But I don’t think you really want to. You still have a life to live. Your firm, your parents, Bree.”

“I don’t know. I think all they love is who they want me to be.”

“That’s because that’s the only person you’ve let them know. You’ve never been yourself with them. Or with anyone. And I’m afraid that’s partially my fault. You should be allowed to feel however you feel. Sunny or not.” Sandra set down her coffee cup and took my hands in hers. “I’m sorry she—I didn’t teach you that.”

“You did the best you knew how.”

“I did, but now you can do something different. Live your life honestly. Let the people you love know how you feel even if it’s hard. Be wild and messy and real. That’s the only way to really be good. For yourself or anyone else.”

Her words crashed into me like water breaking over a dam. She was right. I had never trusted myself to let anyone know me. I wondered if I could do anything more.

“Mikey, I’m never leaving here.” Her hands held mine like she was pleading for me to save my own life. “You still can.”",1,1763326372.0,WritersOfHorror,0,1.0,False

It’s not intentionally denying myself food, I just don’t want it whatsoever. Then lunch comes around and I just don’t feel like it, I don’t want it. Not just the cooking, I don’t want to order food either and put in the time to consume it. I spend the day drinking iced coffee and water and being busy with other things. I usually put something out to cook for dinner, then it comes down to 8pm and I don’t want the cooked food, and I end up ordering whatever I want and then binging all night yet still going to bed insatiably hungry. And repeat the next morning. 

This is causing me to waste groceries over and over again and also has obviously made me tired and cranky and unwell. Also makes weight loss a humongous challenge, and I’m almost at the diabetic mark. But no matter how bad I get, I can’t simply get myself to just make the food and sit and consume it enough times to fulfill my body’s needs. It feels impossible. I don’t know what this is or what psychology is happening! I do have depression, yes, but I’m functioning well in every single area on my meds except making myself eat. Weak and hungry all the way until I crack and eat an entire pizza and then an entire box of cinnamon bread and a bunch of bowls of cereal before bed.

When I stepped out of the alley, I found myself in a clearing surrounded by a rough ring of pine trees. The sun shone through clouds overhead. Its light fell softly but warmed my body.

I looked behind me to see what I had survived. From the other side, Out was just a brick-lined walkway, a path through the dark. It almost felt welcoming, but I knew I didn’t belong there. Not anymore.

I turned back to look at the clearing surrounding me. It was full of wildflowers and unkempt flower beds with early signs of life. In the middle of the garden stood a small, plain house. It was made of the same white wood so popular in the Square, but its wood was roughly weathered and unevenly painted. It had been lived in. It had survived. A large flutter of butterflies flew around the house in all directions. They weren’t trying to be beautiful. They simply were.

I felt at home in the garden. I had thought I felt at home in Mason County and then, for a moment, in the Square. But this was different. In those places, home was being loved for being exactly what everyone told you to be. It was belonging through obedience. Here, wherever it was, home was being free. Free to do nothing more than breathe. And to be loved anyway.

I felt the screened door to the simple house calling to me. I walked up the stairs kept together with rusty nails. I knocked three times on the door.

One. Two. Three.

Nothing happened. I sighed. I was foolish to expect anything more. No one could live in a place this peaceful.

Then a voice from inside. “One second, hon!” It was the voice of an old, tired woman, but it sounded bright. When the woman opened the door, I knew her instantly. I didn’t yet know her name, but I knew she was a woman who had lived a hard life and yet, somehow, held on to joy. Her long blonde hair was tied in a messy ponytail, and she wore a thin white button-down shirt and torn blue jeans. She wasn’t glamorous. She wasn’t even especially pretty. And her nails and her home were unmanicured. But she was happy.

“Hey there, baby!” she said warmly. She was a person who had never met a stranger. “How do you do?” she reached out her wrinkled hand to shake mine. “I’m Sandra.”

I put my hand in hers and shook unsteadily. I thought I had escaped the Square. I had just entered a new one. Sandra could feel the fear in my pulse. “It’s okay, sweetie.” She patted my hand gently. “If you don’t want to shake, you don’t have to. Hell, you can turn around and leave if you want.” She smiled playfully. She meant those words.

Before I knew what I was doing, I threw myself onto Sandra and hugged her. She had felt my fear but not judged me. She had given me a choice. Sandra put her small arms around me. I was much taller than her four-foot frame.

“Now, now, it’s alright.” Sandra took a step back and placed her hands on my shoulders. “You’re not there anymore. You’re safe.” I stared at her and wiped the tears that had begun to form in my eyes. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions. You wait on the porch and I’ll bring us some coffee.”

Nodding tiredly, I stepped back onto Sandra’s porch and found two weather-eaten rocking chairs. I sat in one and listened to the faint sound of Sandra pouring their coffee. A few minutes later, Sandra walked through the screen door holding a silver coffee service with chipped mugs and a spotted coffee pot. She poured me a cup and sat down in the other rocking chair. She patted my leg with calm firmness.

“Alright,” she said. “Whatcha got?”

I had so many questions. I thought I ought to understand who this was first. “Are you *her*…?”

“Starting with the hard one, huh?” Sandra laughed kindly. “Well, yes. And no.” I held my breath for her next words. “My name is Sandra. The local papers called me Sunny Sandy during my pageant days. That was a *long* time ago.” I thought she was trying to be self-deprecating. I gave her a polite laugh.

“It’s okay, Mikey. I know I’m not that funny.” That made me laugh from my belly. “They called me that because I was always grinning, even when my heels were hurting or the spotlight was in my eyes. My parents were old-fashioned, so they made sure I knew how a good kid was supposed to smile.”

I started to relax. Even if this woman was some strange relative of the Sandy I had just escaped, she knew what my life had been like. It had been her life too.

Sandra continued telling her story. “Well, before you knew it, a talent scout from the big city saw me at one of my pageants. He was real impressed by my talent: my puppet friend Maggie.” My heart hurt as I started to tell Sandra what had happened to her friend. “It’s okay, Mikey,” she said like she had been expecting it. “Sandy and I have been through this day more than a few times by now.”

“So…” I said after listening so far into Sandra’s story. “If *you’re* Sandra Alan, the TV host, what’s…*she*?”

Sandra sighed sadly. “That’s what’s hard to explain, Mikey. She’s…me. Or, part of me.” She could see the confusion in my eyes. “I know that doesn’t make very much sense, but it’s the best I can say. I gave every piece of myself to make *Sunnyside Square*. I didn’t even stay with my Papa after my Mama’s funeral so I could get back to the city for the finale shoot. Me and Papa didn’t talk much after that. Looking back, every time I told myself I wasn’t sad or angry or hurt, I sacrificed more of my life to the show. To the Square.”

“I know the feeling.” I had been doing the same with the campaign.

“One day, I couldn’t do it anymore. My heart just couldn’t take it. I ran away and wound up here. The next day, I tried to go back, but the studio was gone. There was only the Square. When I saw Sandy, I knew what she was. She was what I had become making the show. She was the part of me that wouldn’t let myself be anything but sunny. She told me she could help me be like her. I ended up running back here.”

I could see the resignation in Sandra’s eyes. A sadness that said she deserved that day. “Well, you can come back now, can’t you?” I said hopefully. “I know Mason County would love to see you again. No one’s heard from you in decades.”

“That’s very kind, Mikey,” Sandra said as she gently blew a butterfly off the rim of her coffee cup. “But I can’t. After the Square brought me here…” She couldn’t continue. I didn’t need her to. I knew Sandy had stolen her world.

“Well, can I stay with you?” I thought she needed a friend, but I also didn’t want to face what I had to go back to.

“You can…” Sandra explained. “But I don’t think you really want to. You still have a life to live. Your firm, your parents, Bree.”

“I don’t know. I think all they love is who they want me to be.”

“That’s because that’s the only person you’ve let them know. You’ve never been yourself with them. Or with anyone. And I’m afraid that’s partially my fault. You should be allowed to feel however you feel. Sunny or not.” Sandra set down her coffee cup and took my hands in hers. “I’m sorry she—I didn’t teach you that.”

“You did the best you knew how.”

“I did, but now you can do something different. Live your life honestly. Let the people you love know how you feel even if it’s hard. Be wild and messy and real. That’s the only way to really be good. For yourself or anyone else.”

Her words crashed into me like water breaking over a dam. She was right. I had never trusted myself to let anyone know me. I wondered if I could do anything more.

“Mikey, I’m never leaving here.” Her hands held mine like she was pleading for me to save my own life. “You still can.”",1,1763326245.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

Since im coming from a beach town in Los Angeles with so much to do within walking distance, I’d love to live in a walkable area that is either a) close to shops/coffee/restaurants etc or b) close to water or c) close to both. 

I was thinking anywhere on the east side of Providence, Wickford, Bristol, Newport (might be way out of budget but we’ll see). Is there anywhere else in the state you’d recommend with cute, walkable neighborhoods?",0,1763326243.0,providence,10,0.29,False

When I stepped out of the alley, I found myself in a clearing surrounded by a rough ring of pine trees. The sun shone through clouds overhead. Its light fell softly but warmed my body.

I looked behind me to see what I had survived. From the other side, Out was just a brick-lined walkway, a path through the dark. It almost felt welcoming, but I knew I didn’t belong there. Not anymore.

I turned back to look at the clearing surrounding me. It was full of wildflowers and unkempt flower beds with early signs of life. In the middle of the garden stood a small, plain house. It was made of the same white wood so popular in the Square, but its wood was roughly weathered and unevenly painted. It had been lived in. It had survived. A large flutter of butterflies flew around the house in all directions. They weren’t trying to be beautiful. They simply were.

I felt at home in the garden. I had thought I felt at home in Mason County and then, for a moment, in the Square. But this was different. In those places, home was being loved for being exactly what everyone told you to be. It was belonging through obedience. Here, wherever it was, home was being free. Free to do nothing more than breathe. And to be loved anyway.

I felt the screened door to the simple house calling to me. I walked up the stairs kept together with rusty nails. I knocked three times on the door.

One. Two. Three.

Nothing happened. I sighed. I was foolish to expect anything more. No one could live in a place this peaceful.

Then a voice from inside. “One second, hon!” It was the voice of an old, tired woman, but it sounded bright. When the woman opened the door, I knew her instantly. I didn’t yet know her name, but I knew she was a woman who had lived a hard life and yet, somehow, held on to joy. Her long blonde hair was tied in a messy ponytail, and she wore a thin white button-down shirt and torn blue jeans. She wasn’t glamorous. She wasn’t even especially pretty. And her nails and her home were unmanicured. But she was happy.

“Hey there, baby!” she said warmly. She was a person who had never met a stranger. “How do you do?” she reached out her wrinkled hand to shake mine. “I’m Sandra.”

I put my hand in hers and shook unsteadily. I thought I had escaped the Square. I had just entered a new one. Sandra could feel the fear in my pulse. “It’s okay, sweetie.” She patted my hand gently. “If you don’t want to shake, you don’t have to. Hell, you can turn around and leave if you want.” She smiled playfully. She meant those words.

Before I knew what I was doing, I threw myself onto Sandra and hugged her. She had felt my fear but not judged me. She had given me a choice. Sandra put her small arms around me. I was much taller than her four-foot frame.

“Now, now, it’s alright.” Sandra took a step back and placed her hands on my shoulders. “You’re not there anymore. You’re safe.” I stared at her and wiped the tears that had begun to form in my eyes. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions. You wait on the porch and I’ll bring us some coffee.”

Nodding tiredly, I stepped back onto Sandra’s porch and found two weather-eaten rocking chairs. I sat in one and listened to the faint sound of Sandra pouring their coffee. A few minutes later, Sandra walked through the screen door holding a silver coffee service with chipped mugs and a spotted coffee pot. She poured me a cup and sat down in the other rocking chair. She patted my leg with calm firmness.

“Alright,” she said. “Whatcha got?”

I had so many questions. I thought I ought to understand who this was first. “Are you *her*…?”

“Starting with the hard one, huh?” Sandra laughed kindly. “Well, yes. And no.” I held my breath for her next words. “My name is Sandra. The local papers called me Sunny Sandy during my pageant days. That was a *long* time ago.” I thought she was trying to be self-deprecating. I gave her a polite laugh.

“It’s okay, Mikey. I know I’m not that funny.” That made me laugh from my belly. “They called me that because I was always grinning, even when my heels were hurting or the spotlight was in my eyes. My parents were old-fashioned, so they made sure I knew how a good kid was supposed to smile.”

I started to relax. Even if this woman was some strange relative of the Sandy I had just escaped, she knew what my life had been like. It had been her life too.

Sandra continued telling her story. “Well, before you knew it, a talent scout from the big city saw me at one of my pageants. He was real impressed by my talent: my puppet friend Maggie.” My heart hurt as I started to tell Sandra what had happened to her friend. “It’s okay, Mikey,” she said like she had been expecting it. “Sandy and I have been through this day more than a few times by now.”

“So…” I said after listening so far into Sandra’s story. “If *you’re* Sandra Alan, the TV host, what’s…*she*?”

Sandra sighed sadly. “That’s what’s hard to explain, Mikey. She’s…me. Or, part of me.” She could see the confusion in my eyes. “I know that doesn’t make very much sense, but it’s the best I can say. I gave every piece of myself to make *Sunnyside Square*. I didn’t even stay with my Papa after my Mama’s funeral so I could get back to the city for the finale shoot. Me and Papa didn’t talk much after that. Looking back, every time I told myself I wasn’t sad or angry or hurt, I sacrificed more of my life to the show. To the Square.”

“I know the feeling.” I had been doing the same with the campaign.

“One day, I couldn’t do it anymore. My heart just couldn’t take it. I ran away and wound up here. The next day, I tried to go back, but the studio was gone. There was only the Square. When I saw Sandy, I knew what she was. She was what I had become making the show. She was the part of me that wouldn’t let myself be anything but sunny. She told me she could help me be like her. I ended up running back here.”

I could see the resignation in Sandra’s eyes. A sadness that said she deserved that day. “Well, you can come back now, can’t you?” I said hopefully. “I know Mason County would love to see you again. No one’s heard from you in decades.”

“That’s very kind, Mikey,” Sandra said as she gently blew a butterfly off the rim of her coffee cup. “But I can’t. After the Square brought me here…” She couldn’t continue. I didn’t need her to. I knew Sandy had stolen her world.

“Well, can I stay with you?” I thought she needed a friend, but I also didn’t want to face what I had to go back to.

“You can…” Sandra explained. “But I don’t think you really want to. You still have a life to live. Your firm, your parents, Bree.”

“I don’t know. I think all they love is who they want me to be.”

“That’s because that’s the only person you’ve let them know. You’ve never been yourself with them. Or with anyone. And I’m afraid that’s partially my fault. You should be allowed to feel however you feel. Sunny or not.” Sandra set down her coffee cup and took my hands in hers. “I’m sorry she—I didn’t teach you that.”

“You did the best you knew how.”

“I did, but now you can do something different. Live your life honestly. Let the people you love know how you feel even if it’s hard. Be wild and messy and real. That’s the only way to really be good. For yourself or anyone else.”

Her words crashed into me like water breaking over a dam. She was right. I had never trusted myself to let anyone know me. I wondered if I could do anything more.

“Mikey, I’m never leaving here.” Her hands held mine like she was pleading for me to save my own life. “You still can.”",0,1763326035.0,creepypasta,0,0.5,False

I once promised myself I would never work a full-moon shift again — but apparently, I’ve been so disoriented lately that I didn’t even notice I was scheduled for one. I came in for night shift like normal: slept during the day, woke up, ate, gym, nap, snack, then work. One transfer, one new admission, three high-risk escapees, and several patients reported as *“stable.”* I should’ve known better — nothing stays stable on a full-moon night.

Everything started out normally until three emergencies happened back-to-back, where three patients began deteriorating within two hours. We managed to stabilize one, another declined, and the chaos continued. When my CNA and I finally began rounding, we got to the last patient, opened the door, and boom — he was sitting on the floor like it was no big deal.

**Lord have mercy.**

This patient actually likes me — I did his post-op care and he always smiles when he sees me. He looked up like it was a casual conversation starter and said, *“Oh, you’re here?”* I tried to stay calm and asked why he was on the floor; it hadn’t even been twenty minutes since I last peeked in. He smiled again and said he wanted to go home and decided to follow his wife who had just left.

I didn’t activate a full emergency call because we had three other unstable, high-risk wanderers finally resting, and if alarms went off, they’d be roaming again like ghosts in a bad horror movie. I called my coworkers quietly instead, and thank God I had the perfect teamwork that night. We safely assisted him back into bed and completed our assessment — **patient was unharmed, thank goodness.** He later told me he just got out of bed and felt tired so he sat down.

Now, here’s where it gets… *full-moon cinematic.*

One of the interns assigned that night was giving the worst responses during emergencies. When anaphylaxis hit because a patient knowingly ate strawberries she was allergic to, I was prepping everything we needed while the intern stayed on the phone asking long, irrelevant questions instead of arriving immediately. Three times, while I was handling life-threatening issues, she kept asking:

• “What did she do?”  
• “Where did she get it?”  
• “How did it happen?”  
• “Why did it happen?”  
• “When did it start?”

**Child, not now. Come ask in person while we prep and save the patient’s life.**

I was three seconds from losing all professionalism, only held together by the Lord, caffeine, and pure survival instinct. Thankfully I only worked one night with her — the next shift I got an intern I actually enjoy working with. We barely need full sentences; he just reads my face like subtitles. We’ve been through battles, and it shows.

Back to the full-moon chaos:

The same strawberry-allergy patient was swollen and short of breath, so I called for help without alarms again to avoid triggering the wanderers. We stabilized her, and the intern arrived just as the hard part was over, casually commenting, *“Oh, looks like most of the work is done.”*

I clenched my fists and prayed the Slavic in me stayed silent.

And it didn’t stop there.

Another coworker urgently called us to her room — patient in respiratory arrest after leaving the hospital to smoke who-knows-what. No idea what substances were involved; he didn’t look like he only smoked. While trying to intubate, the same intern kept calling instead of coming, asking another list of questions. I finally said:

**“Get here immediately — now — or I’m reporting this to the highest authority on duty.”**

She arrived several seconds later and still didn’t take effective action, so we continued lifesaving measures with the team and ensured documentation and orders were signed appropriately.

**GURL!** Forty-five minutes later, another post-op patient spiked a **103.9°F** fever, was shivering, hyperventilating, had a clotting history, and missed doses due to surgery. My coworker called the intern again and explained everything over the phone *while requesting immediate presence.* The intern dismissively responded, *“It’s normal to have a fever after surgery.”*

**In what dimension is 103.9°F normal?**

I took the phone and said:  
**“You have three seconds to get here.”**

When she finally arrived — with her attending, resident, and surgeon — we stepped aside and let them manage it.

By **3:00 AM**, we were exhausted, hungry, and still hadn’t taken a break. Then my new admission arrived escorted by three police officers. I told the porter, *“No.”* He laughed until he realized I wasn’t joking. For once, the police told me to breathe first because the patient was stable, under arrest, and couldn’t go anywhere. Obviously, I completed my assessment and started my admission but left the non-immediate paperwork for later. To be honest, most patients complain about having to answer so many questions so late at night — and we all know emergency departments and detailed reports do **not** go together. I still had to review notes, medical history, diagnoses, meds, allergies, and more.

My CNA whispered,  
**“This is what they call a full-moon night shift.”**  
She was right.

To which I said,  
**“Air traffic controllers get mandatory breaks — we handle lives too. Why are we doing twelve-hour shifts with no break?”**

I eventually completed the admission after prioritizing food, charting, and sanity. Near **6:00 AM**, chaos returned — another patient possibly mixed substances after heavy medications and went into respiratory arrest. My coworker tried managing it while contacting the intern, who again delayed and asked unnecessary questions. The patient later passed away, and we learned he had a long history of illicit substance use.

Near the end of shift, the intern approached me with attitude, saying,  
**“I don’t appreciate the way you talk to me.”**

I calmly responded that emergencies require immediate bedside presence, not prolonged phone conversations. Patient safety always comes before personal feelings, and delays could cost lives. I reminded her that our unit requires teamwork, fast response, and emotional resilience — this is not a setting where ego or sensitivity can outweigh critical care. I was trying to stay professional and polite when all I wanted to say was:  
**“GURL, seriously! Get a grip! My patients come before your emotions and ego.”**

Morning finally came, and my coworker reported to our manager that the intern claimed it is *normal* to spike a fever post-op and that she dismissed my coworker and called her names, and didn’t show up until the surgeon was paged. Diary, I wasn’t aware of all the details because the intern told my coworker some of this before an emergency was declared. My coworker reported that she initially called the intern when the patient **first** appeared unwell, but the intern delayed until the fever spiked — and that my coworker had to page the surgeon just minutes before initiating the emergency process.

My manager’s response was:  
**“If the intern said it was normal, then it’s normal.”**

*Insert head-turning meme.*

Now, here’s the thing: my manager already had enemies — the number went from 80% to 97% of staff on the unit despising her. I usually stay in the background listening to the gossip, chilling with my cup of coffee or tea. Because at the end of the day, I am there for my patients — not coworkers, not family members, not managers. My priority is my patients’ wellbeing, always.

I finally gave my handoff report — my coworker looked terrified, laughed awkwardly, and said,  
**“Well… sounds like you had a fun night.”**

I requested a night off as soon as I got home.

I prayed never to experience another night like that again.

Two days later, I returned and learned another nurse confronted the same intern after being called *“stupid”* and *“unskilled.”* Now almost no one is willing to guide her — meanwhile, the other interns who collaborate, communicate, and actually respect the team are thriving, learning, and even enjoying their clinical time. Two of them are my favorites; they ask for advice, develop quickly, and work with us — not above us or against us.

Gurl, I felt bad a bit — I heard the CNAs gossiping in the kitchen that this intern may need to find a new hospital. She made so many enemies on every level, her life is becoming difficult because she has to jump through hoops to find answers, while the other interns can simply ask us and we’re happy to help. She saw herself as high-and-mighty and nurses as her servants. TBH she has too much ego to ask for help to begin with.

**GURL, pack it, I say.**

Even though she made so many enemies, if she ever asks me something, I always answer. I keep reminding her — and everyone I work with — that I am here for the patients, not for her and not for catty coworkers.

I have a few nights off before returning to the madness, and then vacation begins. I cannot wait — the cold, the snow, the comfort of home. My mother’s borscht and fresh bread are calling my soul.

10 years ago I finished cosmetology school. I was really proud of myself. It was a lot of hard work, but I did it. I got salon jobs. Loved working with clients. Didn’t always love how wasteful the industry was, but tried to do my best at not being a wasteful stylist. 

I loved what I did so much, I wanted to teach it. I worked at a beauty school for three years, but got super burnt out. (That could be its own other tale.)

Recently, I was working in a salon as the receptionist. The last 6-9 months have just been *awful*. It really made me hate the salon/beauty industry “culture”. 

I would have to calm adult temper tantrums over the phone with people who couldn’t get exactly what they want when they wanted, and thought that I could just “bump someone off the schedule” to get them in. All the people that would without batting an eye spend more than my rent on one hair service. 

Not to mention my coworkers themselves and their wastefulness. Food left in the shared refrigerator for days if not weeks to the point of spoilage. Coffees and lattes left all over the salon. The carelessness for their tools. I saw one stylist go through four hair dryers in a year because of carelessness; she would drop it constantly, leave it in her car in extreme temperatures, never cleaned it. 

I guess what I’m asking for is has anyone else here felt like they have needed to leave a career path behind because it doesn’t align with them anymore? As much as I love doing peoples hair, and helping people feel good. I can’t justify supporting that industry. Maybe it was just where I was. I just felt icky for so long working there.

Tomorrow I’m starting a new job working for an office that helps young people with autism. I won’t be one of the teachers/therapists working with the young people directly. I already feel a little better about the work I will be doing helping these families and young people.

1oywkcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1oywkcd/what_is_the_best_way_to_make_iced_coffee_at_home/,What is the best way to make iced coffee at home?,"I have been trying to make my coffee drinks at home since the cost from these coffee shops are kind of expensive to be going to multiple times a week.

Normally what I do is that I brew a pot, let it sit at room temperature and then pour it into an air tight pitcher to sit in the refrigerator over night (I don't put ice on it)

It always tastes either burnt, watered down, sour or all of the above.

What am I doing wrong? I usually follow the proper guidelines for water to coffee ratio, using a coarser ground. I have tried experimenting with different beans and I always have the same result. I use a west bend coffee maker and it has an option to brew it for iced coffee but that doesn't seem to make much of a difference.

If it isn't really possible to make iced coffee like this, would a cold brew maker be better? I have one that I got from TJ Maxx but I'm not really sure the best way to use it.

When I stepped out of the alley, I found myself in a clearing surrounded by a rough ring of pine trees. The sun shone through clouds overhead. Its light fell softly but warmed my body.

I looked behind me to see what I had survived. From the other side, Out was just a brick-lined walkway, a path through the dark. It almost felt welcoming, but I knew I didn’t belong there. Not anymore.

I turned back to look at the clearing surrounding me. It was full of wildflowers and unkempt flower beds with early signs of life. In the middle of the garden stood a small, plain house. It was made of the same white wood so popular in the Square, but its wood was roughly weathered and unevenly painted. It had been lived in. It had survived. A large flutter of butterflies flew around the house in all directions. They weren’t trying to be beautiful. They simply were.

I felt at home in the garden. I had thought I felt at home in Mason County and then, for a moment, in the Square. But this was different. In those places, home was being loved for being exactly what everyone told you to be. It was belonging through obedience. Here, wherever it was, home was being free. Free to do nothing more than breathe. And to be loved anyway.

I felt the screened door to the simple house calling to me. I walked up the stairs kept together with rusty nails. I knocked three times on the door.

One. Two. Three.

Nothing happened. I sighed. I was foolish to expect anything more. No one could live in a place this peaceful.

Then a voice from inside. “One second, hon!” It was the voice of an old, tired woman, but it sounded bright. When the woman opened the door, I knew her instantly. I didn’t yet know her name, but I knew she was a woman who had lived a hard life and yet, somehow, held on to joy. Her long blonde hair was tied in a messy ponytail, and she wore a thin white button-down shirt and torn blue jeans. She wasn’t glamorous. She wasn’t even especially pretty. And her nails and her home were unmanicured. But she was happy.

“Hey there, baby!” she said warmly. She was a person who had never met a stranger. “How do you do?” she reached out her wrinkled hand to shake mine. “I’m Sandra.”

I put my hand in hers and shook unsteadily. I thought I had escaped the Square. I had just entered a new one. Sandra could feel the fear in my pulse. “It’s okay, sweetie.” She patted my hand gently. “If you don’t want to shake, you don’t have to. Hell, you can turn around and leave if you want.” She smiled playfully. She meant those words.

Before I knew what I was doing, I threw myself onto Sandra and hugged her. She had felt my fear but not judged me. She had given me a choice. Sandra put her small arms around me. I was much taller than her four-foot frame.

“Now, now, it’s alright.” Sandra took a step back and placed her hands on my shoulders. “You’re not there anymore. You’re safe.” I stared at her and wiped the tears that had begun to form in my eyes. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions. You wait on the porch and I’ll bring us some coffee.”

Nodding tiredly, I stepped back onto Sandra’s porch and found two weather-eaten rocking chairs. I sat in one and listened to the faint sound of Sandra pouring their coffee. A few minutes later, Sandra walked through the screen door holding a silver coffee service with chipped mugs and a spotted coffee pot. She poured me a cup and sat down in the other rocking chair. She patted my leg with calm firmness.

“Alright,” she said. “Whatcha got?”

I had so many questions. I thought I ought to understand who this was first. “Are you *her*…?”

“Starting with the hard one, huh?” Sandra laughed kindly. “Well, yes. And no.” I held my breath for her next words. “My name is Sandra. The local papers called me Sunny Sandy during my pageant days. That was a *long* time ago.” I thought she was trying to be self-deprecating. I gave her a polite laugh.

“It’s okay, Mikey. I know I’m not that funny.” That made me laugh from my belly. “They called me that because I was always grinning, even when my heels were hurting or the spotlight was in my eyes. My parents were old-fashioned, so they made sure I knew how a good kid was supposed to smile.”

I started to relax. Even if this woman was some strange relative of the Sandy I had just escaped, she knew what my life had been like. It had been her life too.

Sandra continued telling her story. “Well, before you knew it, a talent scout from the big city saw me at one of my pageants. He was real impressed by my talent: my puppet friend Maggie.” My heart hurt as I started to tell Sandra what had happened to her friend. “It’s okay, Mikey,” she said like she had been expecting it. “Sandy and I have been through this day more than a few times by now.”

“So…” I said after listening so far into Sandra’s story. “If *you’re* Sandra Alan, the TV host, what’s…*she*?”

Sandra sighed sadly. “That’s what’s hard to explain, Mikey. She’s…me. Or, part of me.” She could see the confusion in my eyes. “I know that doesn’t make very much sense, but it’s the best I can say. I gave every piece of myself to make *Sunnyside Square*. I didn’t even stay with my Papa after my Mama’s funeral so I could get back to the city for the finale shoot. Me and Papa didn’t talk much after that. Looking back, every time I told myself I wasn’t sad or angry or hurt, I sacrificed more of my life to the show. To the Square.”

“I know the feeling.” I had been doing the same with the campaign.

“One day, I couldn’t do it anymore. My heart just couldn’t take it. I ran away and wound up here. The next day, I tried to go back, but the studio was gone. There was only the Square. When I saw Sandy, I knew what she was. She was what I had become making the show. She was the part of me that wouldn’t let myself be anything but sunny. She told me she could help me be like her. I ended up running back here.”

I could see the resignation in Sandra’s eyes. A sadness that said she deserved that day. “Well, you can come back now, can’t you?” I said hopefully. “I know Mason County would love to see you again. No one’s heard from you in decades.”

“That’s very kind, Mikey,” Sandra said as she gently blew a butterfly off the rim of her coffee cup. “But I can’t. After the Square brought me here…” She couldn’t continue. I didn’t need her to. I knew Sandy had stolen her world.

“Well, can I stay with you?” I thought she needed a friend, but I also didn’t want to face what I had to go back to.

“You can…” Sandra explained. “But I don’t think you really want to. You still have a life to live. Your firm, your parents, Bree.”

“I don’t know. I think all they love is who they want me to be.”

“That’s because that’s the only person you’ve let them know. You’ve never been yourself with them. Or with anyone. And I’m afraid that’s partially my fault. You should be allowed to feel however you feel. Sunny or not.” Sandra set down her coffee cup and took my hands in hers. “I’m sorry she—I didn’t teach you that.”

“You did the best you knew how.”

“I did, but now you can do something different. Live your life honestly. Let the people you love know how you feel even if it’s hard. Be wild and messy and real. That’s the only way to really be good. For yourself or anyone else.”

Her words crashed into me like water breaking over a dam. She was right. I had never trusted myself to let anyone know me. I wondered if I could do anything more.

“Mikey, I’m never leaving here.” Her hands held mine like she was pleading for me to save my own life. “You still can.”",1,1763325676.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

1oywiz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1oywiz0/review_hyatt_vivid_grand_island_oct_into_nov_2025/,Review: Hyatt Vivid Grand Island | Oct into Nov 2025," For context we've visited Cancun/Riviera Maya and stayed in different resorts at least 2x per year for the last 12 years. For this trip we were a mid-fifties couple staying 7 nights for a significant wedding anniversary. We were there over the weekend Halloween and dia de los muertos were celebrated.

**tl;dr:**

An excellent experience and we'll definitely be returning. Of note this is adults only and on the quieter side. Even the parties held for the holidays were on the more sedate side, but there was special food, activities, live music, and dancing. You can easily make things as fun as you want them to be here.

Pros:

Customer Service: Top notch throughout the resort. Vantage Club staff especially went above and beyond at every turn, both at the Vantage Club lounge and the rooftop pool bar. Was really impressed how knowledgeable they all were. The bartenders were very proactive suggesting drinks and even handing out tasters of interesting things to try. Food service in the Vantage Club lounge were also proactive ensuring the little food bar was always presented beautifully with more choice than you'd expect for such a small space.

Food: Best I've experienced in Mexico, especially the steaks. We even experienced great service in the buffet restaurant which has some wonderful local food options at every meal. Room service was surprisingly fast for a Mexican resort, and also accurate when stating how soon to expect delivery. Food was always delivered at the proper temperature well-prepared and fresh. It never seemed to matter where you went you could always get food and drinks conveniently at this resort. 

Room: Comfortable, clean, very nice mattress, great sunset view, well-stocked drinks including coffee pods.
.
Drinks: Never found the drinks at any bar tasted watered down. The top shelf Vantage Club options were multitudinous and excellent. We found all our favorites. Even the regular drinks we had at the regular bars were very acceptable versions. 

Included Excursions: Great beach club with excellent service and food and there was also a wonderful secondary beach location with all sorts of paddle boards and other non-powered equipment plus you can use a flow rider.

Included activities: Loads of included activities throughout the day every day into the evening, plus great additional activities for Halloween and dia de los muertos. Can't say enough good things about either party and it was pretty much all included at no extra charge. Especially enjoyed the tasting activities and the ones where you made items. Evening activities were on the sedate side but did include live music, dancing, good company, and great drinks. 

Gym/Exercise: The gym had plenty of nice quality equipment which was enough even at busier hours in the early am. Always found plenty of towels and supplies in the gym and saw staff proactively checking this frequently. The exercise classes, especially the early morning activities on the rooftop, were all top notch. 

Pools: Towels were always readily available for guests to have as many as they liked. Never ran into a situation where we couldn't just grab some if they weren't already waiting on whatever loungers we'd snagged. Staff was at it early every morning cleaning the pools.

Rooftop Pool: Beautiful views with the best views of sunrise and sunset you'll see anywhere. Fun watching the planes take off and land across the lagoon at the airport. The pool bar service and bartenders was always top notch and they were great about filling up my insulated mug with whatever cocktail I asked for. They also went out of their way to hand out tasters of all sorts of new cocktails from time to time throughout each day. Although bar service was slated to end at the pool at a certain time they didn't roll up the bar the instant that time arrived. Each afternoon they made sure everyone got a last drink before shutting it down which was very appreciated.

Special mention: Staff made sure to give us a lovely experience including a special treat in our room on our actual anniversary which was Thursday after we arrived. Staff in the Vantage Club lounge on the ground floor went out of their way to congratulate us when we went in for cocktails before dinner and even suggested a special cocktail we thoroughly enjoyed. Can't say enough good things about our room steward or staff in the Vantage Club lounge here.

Extra Charge: Romance dinner on the rooftop at sunset was our one splurge. Absolutely magical and the food and service were beyond top notch. Definitely recommend the platinum experience on the rooftop. We thought it was good value for money considering how special the event was for us. 

Summary:

We stayed from Tuesday to Tuesday but understandably it seemed most stayed from Saturday or Sunday until the following Saturday or Sunday. The first week we were there the resort seemed pretty empty as there were always plenty of seats anywhere you went even if you didn't get there early like we always make a point of doing. We arrived at the rooftop pool around 11 am Tuesday and still got seats right at poolside on arrival day. Also had no trouble getting seats at the Beach Club arriving at 11 am the next day. Didn't have any difficulties joining any activity. Our habit of showing up 10-15 minutes in advance meant we were inevitably the first to join in during this first week.

All the bars were great with excellent bartenders and the cocktail making classes are absolutely top notch. Even if you're not in a Vantage Club level room you can participate and get name brand liquors plus all sorts of wonderful juices and fancy mix ins by attending the cocktail mixing classes. The instructors made it fun and delicious which everyone appreciated. A couple of times when more people showed up than they had equipment for they even offered a second class so everyone could participate. 

Also can't say enough good things about the rooftop pool bar service or the Vantage Club bar, but we experienced excellence at every bar on the property. The ice cream bar in the indoor lobby area was a delight, and the pastries they also serve are really good. Loved finding them open first thing in the morning and they were always fast serving up excellent espresso drinks. You don't have to be Vantage Club to go up to the roof and enjoy the sunrise or sunset out on the deck overlooked by the gym windows.

One Con:

Come Saturday evening week two it really seemed as if the resort had filled up a lot more based on how things were filling up from that point onward. Even with a reservation we had to wait on a table at dinner on Saturday and it was the same Sunday and Monday. I believe this has since been alleviated by opening more of the restaurants as not everything was open when we were there.

In addition that second week by 8:30 am all the seats at the rooftop pool were taken even those off to one side away from the pool, we had to wait for a table at the roof top restaurant for breakfast and lunch, the first couple vans to the beach club were filled before the first even arrived, seats at the beach club filled up before 11 am, and if you didn't show up at least 15-20 minutes early for any activity you'd find it was already overfilled. Staff worked very hard to make it all transition smoothly but there were a few times when it was clear they were getting overwhelmed. I want to emphasis how patient and kind staff was throughout all of this. 

This was when we had our one truly negative experience at the resort. I'm not listing this to get anyone in trouble but rather I think they're struggling with knowing how to staff due to demand changing rapidly as it slips into higher season from a period of lower demand. The resort is pretty new so I think they'll get much better with this by next year. 

Shortly after lunch started Tuesday morning of the busier second week we lined up at the Vantage Club restaurant on the roof. After a very short wait we were seated along with another table who were seated on the other side of the restaurant after us. Somehow someone showed up to hand out menus and get drink orders at the other table across the restaurant, but no one came near ours. 

All the staff looked very busy rushing about so we figured our server was just tied up. We watched as the other table ordered their food and waited at least another ten minutes before I went to the bar to order us some drinks. It probably took 5-6 minutes for us to get them since the bartender served orders from waitstaff already received first. No problem as we were not in a hurry. By the time I sat down with the drinks the other table was already enjoying their meal. 

Twenty minutes later we still had not seen a server so I caught a server walking by. A young man was buttonholed to take our orders and apologized saying he thought someone else was waiting on us. It was a good 30 minutes before someone else brought our food and it was absolutely horrible. Cold, overcooked, and some of it wasn't even what we'd asked for.

I guess we could have complained but I don't think it was intentional. I think they were just overwhelmed and perhaps me getting drinks for us caused confusion although there were those who arrived with drinks which didn't seem to cause any confusion for them. We ended up just going down to the Vantage Club and having some sandwiches there instead. 

We didn't run into an other unexpected issues which in our experience only one thing in 7 days is top tier excellence.",4,1763325617.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

Hey guys , 
I am pretty new to the Df54 and espresso. 
I have been brewing coffee from my local Roastery.
But i am facing a little difficulty. 
Ill let you my work flow.

Shot pull number 1
1. Grind 18gm coffee (retention is 0.1-0.3gm) (10.75/11 setting , where my true zero is at -3)
2. Fill in portafilter 
3. Use RDT tool and tamp with Bomber feedback tamper + puck screen
4. Flow some water for 3-4 sec and them run the shot. 
5. 36/38 gm coffee out within 23-25 sec.


Shot pull number 2 ( coffee , grind size and puck prep remains same )

1. Wash the portafilter with tap water (cold / room temp ) 
2. Wash puck screen 
3. Repeat all the steps of shot 1. 


BUT THIS TIME the puck chokes the machine , pulls a shot in 1minute and channels everywhere. 
 
Try to pull shot 3 

And same chocking happens.

This happens every time i pull back to back shot. (And if it doesn’t choke the machine , it adds 5-6 sec to the second or later shots)

Can i please know whats the problem ..? 

1. Is my grinder inconsistent ..? ( but if it , it should choke 1st shot as well , it seems to be consistent at spoiling my shots followed to 1st shot.

2. Is it my coffee machine ( hibrew h10a) 

3. Is it water Temp. 

What is it..? Can you guys please help ..?

1oyvy86,https://i.redd.it/hq8xfiubgo1g1.jpeg,Heavy duty extension cords,"If this is a stupid question please be kind. We just bought our first home and I have very little experience with electrical beyond changing out an outlet at my old apartment. This is a bit long but I wanted to include as much detail as possible. Here’s my situation… 

We bought a bar/coffee cabinet to house our beverage fridge and to place our coffee maker on since counter space is limited in the kitchen.  The only outlet is directly behind the cabinet so I grabbed two separate short (3 feet) extension cords with flat plugs so I can plug coffee maker and mini fridge into their own, separate extension cord and the cabinet can still be mostly flush with the wall. I’d like to place a lamp next to the cabinet but there is literally no other outlet I could use without running an extension cord across the entire dining room. Here is my question… first, I know most appliances say not to use extension cords and instead plug directly into the wall. These are super old flat plug extension cords so I plan to order ones that are heavy duty and rated for these appliances. Looks like the coffee machine is 1500 watts and the fridge is somewhere around 100. Because the fridge is low I was hoping to find a heavy duty dual plug extension cord (or even medium duty, just something better than a cheap amazon extension cord) that I could plug both the fridge and the lamp into which would leave the coffee maker on its own plug. I have been unable to find an extension cord like this with a flat plug. The only ones I can find that have space for two plugs have a normal plug for the wall, not flat. The picture included here is all I can find but I’m not sure if it’s rated high enough.

Basically here’s where I’m at. Is it even safe to have these three things on the same outlet? The outlet is grounded if that helps/matters. If it is, do you think a lighter duty flat plug extension cord (Iike the picture I’ve attached)  with two receptacles for the mini fridge and lamp is safe? Again, I can’t find anything like this with two spots for plugs AND a flat plug so the cabinet can sit flush with the wall. At least not anything rated as 14AWG for example. And yes I know wireless lamps and rechargeable light bulbs exist but I just hate how often they have to be charged. ",1,1763324255.0,AskElectricians,9,1.0,False

It’s been a rough few months in my school due to having some conflicts with some classmates in my new school. So I’ve been not in the best mindset and been really needing a friend. So in October my friend from the west booked tickets to come see me. She visited me in November for four days and once she left she was telling me how she felt like she was just a convenience to me because majority of what we did was stay at mines or my other friends apartment. I understand why she was mad because she helped me clean my apartment, do laundry, and move some furniture. But she said she “goes with the flow” so I thought she was okay with whatever. 

Something she was mad about me was that I was flaking a lot. I did mention we were gonna see the beach town, a popular city in my state, parks, coffee shops, etc. and yes we didn’t see any of that but I remember she said she wanted some time to study/rest. She is also allergic to my cats so she wasn’t as energetic than most days so I thought spending more time resting would be better. Basically all we did is see this little strip and visit my friends apartment but she’s usually more upfront and she didn’t mention it bothering her so I thought she would be okay with hanging w them everyday. 

I understand why she is mad because she is a huge traveler and is not the greatest at meeting new people n such but I just think she should’ve communicated how she felt in the moment rather than waiting till she flew back to send me her feelings. I was also thinking that she enjoyed being around my new friends and that I was helping her get out of her comfort zone.

I place the eggs in, add about half a pan of water, and cover it with a medium plate flipped upside down. I turn the burner on high, and within a couple minutes steam appears. Then I turn off the heat and let it sit for 3–5 minutes.

No over-boiling, no babysitting, and no need for an egg steamer. Works for me every time.  What do you think?",2,1763324028.0,Cooking,3,1.0,False
