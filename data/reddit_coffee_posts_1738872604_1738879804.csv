1ijexvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1ijexvz/factorio_is_a_programming_masterpiece_can_we_get/,Factorio is a programming masterpiece. Can we get some deeper technical insight?,"I'm aware of the [academic paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04871) and I'd love to see more of this kind of deep analysis. I can't even imagine the various low-level optimizations. The scale of the software is also impressive - feature-complex software requires constant refactoring to reduce code complexity to keep the software maintainable. I'm super interested in the patterns and practices used.

Some questions I would have:

* Saving is lightning fast. Looks like straight stream copy. How does this work and did the requirement for fast saves cause you to make compromises elsewhere?
* Are you using OOP?
* How much assembly did you have to write? 
* Are you using a lot of intrinsics, or are you relying on compiler optimizations?
* I assume you had to optimize for cache locality? What methods did you use? Did MCM's change your strategy? 3D V-Cache? 
* Threading primitives and patterns? How did you divide and synchronize the work?
* How did you handle testing new ideas? With a game so dependent on optimization, how did you keep from spiraling down optimization rabbit holes?
* How did you design the scripting so it minimized performance impact? What kind of compromises did you have to make for scripting?
* Do you have automated testing?
* What tools are you using?
* How do you manage code changes (like, process, not source control)? What process are you using to manage new features and the development lifecycle?
* What were the biggest differences in opinion over algorithm / game design? (besides fluid simulation, of course, which seemed politically sticky from the outside =D)
* What are you using for internal documentation?
* Which algorithms surprised you?

Sorry I have a BILLION questions. I seriously cannot believe how stable this masterpiece is. The crazy attention to detail. The software community could really learn a lot from what you've accomplished. Please share before you shelve it for your next project! 

You could probably write a book on all the different challenges you faced and how you solved them. If you did, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. If you made it full-color and added images, it would make an incredible coffee-table book or nerd gift! And when the aliens find it in a million years after we've caused our own extinction, they'll know we were an advanced civilization! =P

(Also I apologize if there's something out there already with this info. I couldn't find the deeply technical, meaty stuff. FFF is good, but it's sparse).",1,1738879640.0,factorio,0,1.0,False

1ijex0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1ijex0x/in_laws_making_me_feel_depressed/,In laws making me feel depressed,"Hi everyone, I am just feeling so overwhelmed with emotions and depressed after everything that happened in my family with my in laws.
Me and my husband been together for 2 years got married this summer. He was always clear that he is very close with his family and when I just met them I really liked them, I still remember how my FIL said that they have very ""democratic family"", but now i got to the understanding it was a complete lie.
Our very first conflict happened after a few weeks of our marriage. My FIL demanded that we all fill a document where we actually had to falsify a gov document to fit his agena, but it would be under our own names. He persuaded us that he thought of all the consequences and there will be none and he will take all the responsibility in case anything goes wrong (this is impossible in practice, as in the face of law he cannot take responsibility for me ). I did not want to do it and told my husband so and he agreed with me that we should not do it, but when we called them and told him this he was crazy mad and angry at us, at my husband that he did not ""stand up for him and his words"" and at me cause i dared to go against his will. He also was insulted that there was a thought that he would risk us and we doubted his thinking of consequences, still objectively what he wanted us to do was illegal.
He kept telling my husband that I joined their family and as the oldest he is the boss now and I have to obey. Also he started to put ideas in my husband's head that if i don't listen now i will never be a good wife and will never respect them or him - it hurted me cause before this it was never a case where my husband would think I don't respect him or his opinion but he started to think that cause his father
told him so. He put a fire between us which was never there before. He also invited my parents to talk which causes a lot of stress to them as they are older and very much try to avoid any conflict, they had to meet up and his FIL was stating that i should listen to them and do as he said. My parents calmed them down and mom said just listen to them this time cause he is clearly will not stop so l had to say yes. My husband after this promised me this will never happen and it is just this one time I had to listen.
This all lasted for a week and i was so stressed and anxious, because of having a fight with my husband which we never had before, because my family was dragged into this and they were also stressed and i started to have panick attacks thinking they will divorce us, i was so scared of them and of their anger which was very quick to present, one minute they were nice to me and one minute they were against me and i felt like they wanted to destroy me. It was traumatising as i have never felt this sort of anger towards me from parents figure before.

After this we were planning a trip in a month where I thought i would be able to unwind and rest but his parents said they are coming with us and they did. I haven't healed since that event so i was not vey active during the trip I also felt lots of guilt if i wanted to be by my own or spoke less but i really was not able to enjoy myself as there was lots of anxiety. My husband was also annoyed by me not talking much when with his parents and shouted at me for this saying why would i not speak or use my phone when around them. But i tried my best also during the trip always running around bringing them tea and coffee and helping if they need anything or sitting through long dinners when i was tired.
At the end of the trip i felt very sad that i did not rest at all and only husband and his family were able to have a good time and it saddened me that he did not think of me or my comfort, only his and his family. When we left I told him I don't want to this anymore and go to trips together so often, we already traveled with them for 10 days and lived with them for 3 weeks in a span of months and they said they want to travel with us always and they will tag along every time we go anywhere. We had a big fight and husband said he would divorce me if we we don't travel with them as this is how it is in his family and he wishes to travel with them as we live abroad and he does not see them that often. But so do I, but we have never gone anywhere with my parents, and I also think that newly weds should travel together before they have kids and so on. After this he apologised and said there will also be trips just the two of us but him saying smth about divorce when it came to my comfort and his parents really hurt me and my trust in him.
Fast forward to this winter, we went to our home country and lived with his family. I was feeling better and recovered slightly by this point, tried to be understanding, but whenever we sat down to eat his father would always teach me on things how to eat/ how to dress/life so on and so on. That's ok, I would listen through it all, trying not to pay attention accepting the way that he is. Before going home, i told my husband i really missed my parents and i wish to spend a night at theirs and he is also very welcome, my family loves him and would love it if he could stay with them, but i knew he never would (in our culture for some reason wife's parents are second citizens even though i stayed with his parents the whole trip) but i never even imagined he would consider staying at mine's, but anyway we agreed i would go. I was so happy and my MIL also was ok with me going, i packed my things and my parents was already expecting me when his FIL called and said no, she cannot go, it is not allowe for a wife to go to her old home and spend a night without her husband. Omg, I broke down then and there, it hurted me so much he would forbid me from smth to do with my fam, how can he do this.
But i did not want any conflict and my husband and i agreed that next time we will live separately from them and i can travel alone next time and stay with my family. 
I also planned a trip to to another country with my dad and brother for medical reasons and my husband made me call his parents on video call to let them know of this,  which seemed more like asking for a permission from them and whilst I was on the trip his dad message to my parents saying they know what i am up to and we gave her permission to go..also he gave them advice to how to parent me and lectured them that i should wear warmer clothes and my hat if i want to be healthy, i did not feel comfortable that he now started teaching my parents who are older than him how to speak to their kid - me, i am 26 years old btw and also stating to them that he allowed me to go with them..


We already left them but for some reason i still feel very hurt and i have hard time restoring previous relationships. I still feel traumatised to this day for everything that had happened in this 6months and i am scared of the future now and feel very depressed thinking is this how life is going to be, having to have an approval to things, my husband sort of having my back but actually still making me listen to them and explaining to me that is just the way they are instead of standing up for me. I also feel disconnected from him which is really don’t want and it really hurts, i don’t want to blame this on him.

is it normal that i feel this depressed if we are not with them anymore? My life feels so grey and unhappy now",1,1738879581.0,inlaws,0,1.0,False

1ijevya,https://www.reddit.com/r/InsulinResistance/comments/1ijevya/advice_needed/,Advice needed,"Sorry that this got a bit long :/ 

Hey everyone. I need some advice on my condition because the useless doctors in my country, as I expected, didn't do their job.

So a bit about me. I'm 25, 182cm, 100kg. Terrible lifestyle, as bad as it gets. I only eat and drink junk, I don't move at all, mainly because I had a bad car accident 3 years ago and it took me a lot of time to get on my feet and I just couldn't escape this reality considering I also work from home so I'm only rotting in bed and in my chair all day. Depression, stress, bad emotions, bad mental state. If this is considered a good thing, I don't drink, smoke, take drugs, don't even drink coffee.

I decided it's time to change when I self-diagnosed with GERD. The burning sensation was terrible, as well as some of the other symptoms. Then my journey into reading about my symptoms began. Shortly after, I began jumping from diagnosis to diagnosis on my own. I went from GERD through cancer, diabetes, brain tumors, kidney failure. On top of everything I have social anxiety so it took me 3 months to get the courage to leave my comfort zone and go to a doctor.

When I went to an endo, I told her I'm 99% sure I have diabetes and low testosterone. She sent me to get most of my hormones and my blood checked. Results were terrible but interesting. My testosterone was 530 which is in the middle. At first, when I opened my results and I saw insulin was high I wanted to cry because I thought that was what diabetes means. A few minutes later I realized it was the a1c and it was at 5.3. Back then, I didn't know anything so I got confused. The endo told me I didn't have diabetes but I was worried about my stress hormones being high, prolactin and cortisol. We did a second test and prolactin went in the norm, cortisol went from 680 to 580 so a bit above the norm. 

At that time I didn't have diabetes on my mind and was focused on the stress hormones because I read that if they're high I might have brain tumors. I switched to another doctor because this one sounded inept. His conclusion was it's all due to stress and my lifestyle and that I should come back and retest my stress hormones in 2 months while making a change. Oh I'm just remembering I also had very low vit D (7.3). He prescribed me vigantol for the vitamin D and Metformin for the insulin resistance and never even bothered to explain how serious my situation there is. If I didn't bother to read up on it I'd have just thought I should drink my pills and it's nothing serious. Our main focus was on the stress hormones because I didn't bring up IR then, still not knowing how serious it is. 

After I went home and read up on here about it I wanted to blow my brains out. My HOMA is over 7 which signals severe IR. Which means I need to take drastic measures, something none of these 2 doctors spoke about. Now I'm very worried. Despite all my stress that I've always had I've never had panic attacks until a few days ago because I'm constantly thinking about this. 

What are my chances to fix my situation and never get diabetes? Considering my a1c is still in the normal range but HOMA is so high? I will make a drastic change in my diet, I will start hitting the gym and walking, I will begin drinking that medication. I don't have much hopes of permanently getting rid of IR but I want to avoid the situation where this turns into diabetes. How realistic does this sound with my a1c and HOMA current ranges? For the record, I asked and no one in my family is known to have diabetes. 

And a few other things - about this Metformin - I've seen people hate it and saying it's given them horrible stomach problems... is that only in the beginning while you're adjusting to the medication? I've also seen some label it as gold in a bottle, not sure why, perhaps because it helps them lose weight? What dosage would you say is optimal? From memory, I think the doctor said 500 but I'm unsure if that was once a day or what the dosage was. The receipt is with my dad who's gonna bring it to me by Monday.

And last, about the food - I asked chatgpt about certain foods with my condition and I wanna ask if it's fine to actually have them - eggs, protein shakes (without sugar), tomatoes, cucumbers, chicken, beef steak (the more lean parts), yogurt? Also, what are people's thoughts on Coke Zero? Is it okay to drink 80% water, 20% coke zero?

I have a GCP EVO from 2023 October. 

I have a problem with it. For the first year, I could make 4 cappucino / lattes without turning the steam wand on before light turning on. 

Just wait for the light to turn on, steam 1 pitcher, again and again and again. 

Now I’ve had some probems with it and taken it to warranty and had the steam valve changed but apart from that they found nothing wrong. 

But now I cannot steam milk for 2 coffees in a row. The second pitcher of milk doesnt come out frothy and silky smooth. And the machine seems to run out of steam.  Like it has no pressure / no water in the boiler. 

Any advices ?

1ijeua4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ijeua4/how_to_help_homeless_youth_who_showed_up_at_my/,How to help homeless youth who showed up at my door?,"Last year I was walking my dogs and ran into a boy (let’s call him Luke) who was also walking a dog. Luke asked if I needed any dog walking or sitting, which I really didn’t need, but he seemed desperate for work. One time when he dropped my dogs off he noticed me playing a video game that he also plays and asked if he could join me. I said sure and we began gaming together after the dog walking. Luke never seemed to want to go home, and as someone with a rough childhood, I get it. I let him watch my dogs while I worked night shift. He sometimes would come over beat up and bruised which he said was from school fights or skateboarding. I suspected that wasn’t the truth but he shutdown when I asked him if everything was alright at home. All I knew about his home life is that his mom is dead and that he’s scared of his dad. 

This went on for like a year, during which Luke turned 18 and graduated high school. He was trying to save up to rent his own place but it was difficult because his dad had been charging him rent since he was 16, all his dog walking money was going there. I helped him make a resume and he got a decent job at a restaurant. 

Fast forward to a few days ago, I come home from my shift around 3 am to find Luke laying outside my door. He is in rough shape, his face is bloody and beaten and he can barely stand. I help him up and bring him to my sofa where I hug him while he breaks down and tells me what happened. He is sobbing and bleeding on me and my heart breaks for him as I listen. Luke tells me his dad had been beating him up his whole life and the authorities look the other way because his dad is a sheriff’s deputy. Luke and his dad got in an argument and Luke said it wouldn’t matter anyway since he was saving up to move out. When Luke told his dad that he would soon be getting his own place, his dad attacked him worse than ever and threw him out. He threatened to kill Luke if he ever came back. Luke ran to my place even though he had to leave my spare key behind and collapsed at the door for several hours until I came back. I wiped off the blood and tended to Luke’s wounds, he has several cuts on his face and bruises all over. His wrist was sprained from when he tried to protect his face and his dad yanked it away to punch his face. I had him text his manager and call in sick to give him time to recover. I made him a bed in my sofa, my smaller dog curled up with him and they went to sleep. He woke up once in the night panicking and crying from a nightmare so I tucked him in, told him he was safe, and gave him a new ice pack for his face.

The next day he was still asleep when I left for work. I left him a burrito and coffee and advil. I came back to find Luke had cleaned the whole apartment and cooked, even though I told him just to rest. He was playing Xbox with a friend online, both my dogs were snuggled up to him and it was the first time I’d ever seen him genuinely smile. These past few days Luke has just been recovering and he seems so joyful now that he’s free of his dad. He refused to go to the hospital or file a report because he’s still afraid of his dad. He told his coworkers he got jumped. 

So I need advice please. Luke has no home or belongings. His dad has his social security card and birth certificate and Luke has his ID. I am worried about his dad finding his whereabouts, given his police resources. Luke has removed his dad from his bank account and gotten his own phone line. I want to help Luke move to the city and start a new life. Are there any resources that would assist him like free mental health resources? Or any college scholarships he can apply for?

We had to put it in the microwave to heat it up. 
I’ve tried altering the temperature settings but no luck. 

I messaged delonghi and they said 
“The coffee should be dispensed from the machine at approx. 80°C and the milk at approx. 60°C, both before they hit the cup.”
The milk was only coming up in the high 40s. 

So we therefore ended up returning it as we were also looking at the new ninja coffee machine. 
However I’m still swaying towards an automatic machine as I’m too lazy to stand there waiting for the coffee to drip and milk to froth. (Currently have a basic espresso machine)

Was mine just not hot enough because it was refurbished? Anyone else had a problem with their milk based coffees as I’ve seen a few comments about the temperatures of their milk drinks…

I used to work at this office for years that I didn't really fit in personally. It was in my field, but my background was a lot more blue-collar than most of the folks that worked there. In fact, despite my degree I got hired in a facilities position and had to fight tooth and nail to get into a technical role that matched my degrees. While there I made very few friends due to most of the staff being standoffish whenever I was around. Despite this I found myself a little group and we would go get coffee every Friday. 

In this group there was Laura, Jack, and Janet. Janet and I met in grad school and somehow ended up at the same agency. She immediately got hired in a technical role a year or 2 after i was hired. Jack worked in IT so I interacted with him frequently. Laura was in HR. Not really sure how we became friends, but I thought we were pretty tight. 

Well over the next 10 years or so we have this weekly coffee club and things are cool. Other days of the week, Laura, janet and I do lunch walks or get coffee in the morning and talk. Laura and me talked constantly. Like we'd always be the ones hanging  out together at agency functions or trainings. She was my biggest support as I fought to change jobs. Janet had little kids so she would miss work more than us so a lot of time it was just me and Laura. At one point we used the gym together each morning as each other's accountability partner. 

I'm sure that other folks there thought we were sleeping together. I'm sure some of that was straight jealousy. Laura is exactly what people think of when they say western standards of beauty. Blue eyed, blonde, very pretty. I will admit that I was attracted to her, but crossing that line was not a part of the friendship for me. I'm married, my wife has met her, likes her, and while she said she doesn't 'get' our friendship she supported it. We went to her wedding. Her husband and me get along. From our perspective it was clearly a friendship regardless what coworkers thought. 

Fast forward to covid. Jack has already taken another job so we don't do the whole group thing as frequently. Pandemic happens and after, since we don't go into the office as much, communication slows down. I have a kid, you know, life happened. At one point I start feeling a bigger divide between myself and the others. When the protests  started Laura reached out to see how I was doing but the others...well it was more like how it always is for black folk. I started to distance myself from the group. Comm. between me and Laura fall off just because of life and I get a job that is better for me mentally. (I miss the money, though)

I confide in Laura that I'm feeling disconnected from the others and I am going to pull back more. She says she gets it. Over the next few years we talk less. I have my 2nd kid and she has her 1st. They are close in age so I thought we would get them together but that just doesn't happen. I initiate text and she may respond or not. She will respond to the group chat. I start to feel that if I don't meet up with the group I don't get to see her so that happens a couple of times. It goes...fine. I don't have anything in common with the others anymore. She does. 

I'm tired of being the one to reach out. But I want to be there as a friend since all the nuttiness happening in DC is directly affecting her. But I feel like it's not being received. I don't know. Maybe this friendship has just run its course. ",1,1738879044.0,TwoHotTakes,2,1.0,False

1ijekgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ijekgo/zp6_buyers_remorse_should_i_return/,ZP6 Buyers Remorse - Should I Return?,"I want to start by thanking everyone who weighed in on my earlier post on a hand grinder (i.e. ZP6, Kinu, etc.) 

I write buyer's remorse in the title but I'm not actually disappointed for taking a chance - that's life! 

I went with the ZP6 mostly out of intrigue and to see if it suited me. 

I've brewed with it 6-7 times and it just falls flat for me.

Here's what I played around with:

* Beans: I tried two light roasts i) Washed from Peru, and ii) Natural Ethiopian 
* Temp: Tried 91C and 94C on my Stagg
* Brewer: Hario Switch paired with either Kinto papers or Cafec Abaca
* Pours: I tried Coffee chronicler's two pour method, and 4:6 method
* Grinder settings: I tried 5.5 and 6 (and at -0.1 burrs are locked for reference). 

I get it, it is just 6-7 brews with multiple changing variables. 

However, I also feel like I don't want a grinder that will be this finicky to dial in. 

These parameters and beans were fantastic on my DF64 with stock italmill burrs, and Kingrinder K2 (that I sold), and felt very forgiving. 

I am a tired dad and while the hobby is fun I don't think it will be fun if I have a very narrow dial-in zone with this grinder. 

Unrelated it's why I love my Cafelat Robot, just so forgiving. 

Thinking I will return, but if you have any relevant insights or thoughts, I am most appreciative!

1ijejw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1ijejw8/so_sick_of_shitty_ass_relatives/,So sick of shitty ass relatives,"I (f25) recently lost a dear family friend, we will call her Mary (f71), she was friend with my grandma first and she quickly became part of the family. She spent a lot of time with us, ever since before I was even born: holidays (Xmas, Easter, new year, birthdays etc), vacation, outings, we have a family owned beauty salon and she would come basically every day to have a coffee and chat.
She was like a literal grandma to me; she would give me tons of gifts, buy me lot of stuff (she basically bought all of my clothes ever since middle school), take me out for lunch and shopping, be there whenever I needed her. We would often hang out, she would hang out with my mom too, she would go with us (or just my mom) on vacation etc. She’d come pick me up from practice, she’d took me to the cinema or anywhere really, in middle school we’d hang out every Friday and when my grandma died we would visit my great grandmother every week, she taught me how to ride a bike… she was such an important and persistent presence in my life. 

It was a sudden death, just a couple of weeks after Xmas, it was harsh, no one was expecting it. 
Here’s where the “shitty relatives” come into play; she wasn’t very close to them, she actually spent years no contact with them, that’s why my family basically adopted her, and she kind of reconciled with them only 4/5 years ago after her niece died. 
The only relatives left are her SIL, her nephew and grandnephew. 
(SIL and nephew are Jehovah’s witnesses, it will be relevant later)

I went to Mary’s house to see her before they closed the casket to take her to the crematorium. 
While there I asked if I could take some stuff as a memory and asked them to tell me whenever I could come back to take more stuff (not expensive stuff ofc)
A week later they held the funeral, which wasn’t supposed to be a funeral, but more of a commemoration since she was atheist. 

Boy was I wrong. Once we arrived at the cemetery we found out they brought two Jehovah’s witnesses to say something. They probably told them a ton of lies since they spoke about what a “great relationship” she had with her nephew (she hated him), how she had her weekly coffee appointment with SIL (she was literally always with us the other 6 days of the week) and how she recently found god and faith??? 
They even added “she didn’t tell to a lot of people”, yes because it’s not true! I was cringing the whole time, so damn disrespectful. Not even a word for me or my mom. They didn’t even allow anyone to say anything else or even pay their respects before putting the urn in the niche. 

I waited two weeks and yesterday I texted Mary’s SIL to ask when could I come and get other things from Mary’s house. She said she didn’t have the keys anymore because someone stole them and that “the boys” have the keys and they won’t let anyone enter. I asked to speak to grandnephew and she said he doesn’t want to give his number out. 
So I texted nephew, I asked the same thing and he said the apartment had already been emptied and everything donated. 
I wrote a snarky reply saying “what can I say, thanks for letting me know. After this and that little scene at the funeral I now understand why Mary felt that way about you”, hinting at her actually hating him. 
My mom got really angry and sent a text to SIL as well to let her know how shitty were. 

Here’s the best part: after that grand nephew gf (let’s call her Jane) calls my mom, she says SIL promptly called her to tell her what happened with us and not to say anything (Jane said SIL was afraid of us randomly bump into each other and them talking bad about her). So she told us everything: they stolen keys, a lie (obviously), the apartment is indeed empty because nephew came in first to take what he could (probably the only expensive things Mary’s had) and then donated everything without leaving nothing to grandnephew. 
They put the house on sale, without saying anything to grandnephew. 
Also grandnephew has not been talking to them since the funeral because he is mad about the religious ceremony and all the stuff they said (he actually left during the function). Jane also tells her that Mary left 1000€ to pay for her funeral, but instead they used these money to have the lamps from Mary’s parents and grandpa removed from their gravestone (apparently that’s forbidden for JW). 

So that’s it, I feel so disgusted and angry that they had to ruin her memory and disrespect her like this I almost feel sick to the stomach. ",2,1738878682.0,exjw,0,1.0,False

I also have a 30 min commute each way. I also work in the city so I find myself doing thr shopping (both for food and also the 'get me a pair of socks' or 'get me a birthday card for my aunty', 'pop this into the post office/lockers' or 'go into the bank and sort this') - meaning I'm running errands on my lunch about three times a week too.

My bf works 9-5 and goes into the office 1 day a week. He also has a 30 min commute to the office. 

I am getting fed up because despite me waking up at 7.30 to be in the office for 8.30 and only getting back in at 6.00, whilst he wakes up at 8.58 and switches off at 5.00, I'm coming into a house which is a tip at the end of the day. 
He makes his elaborate breakfast and lunch and all the coffees and juices so the kitchen is a mess. 
He wears multiple tops for different meetings (eg he will wear a shirt to a formal client video call but then change into a t shirt for more casual team meetings) so he chucks 3 tops on the back of a seat or in the wash each day! 
The list goes on. 

I say to him he should be stepping up and making sure the house is tidy for me coming home just like to would be if he worked from the office, but he just doesn't get it? 
Also we still split the housework 50/50 and I just don't think this is fair since I'm already doing longer hours just to work.

Before anyone says I should find a job to work from home - this is impossible in my field!

1ijegts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ijegts/my_girlfriend_wants_me_to_cut_off_one_of_my/,My girlfriend wants me to cut off one of my friends. What should I do?,"Hello, my fellow redditors. Today I call upon you all to help me navigate a sticky situation. I’m not expecting an end all be all solution. But any advice or ideas on what I should do would be appreciated. I could really use some help here.

I guess I’ll start by giving you all some context that may help you to get a better picture of the whole thing. I’m a male in my early twenties and the other 2 people involved in this situation are both females in their early twenties. One of them is my girlfriend and the other is a friend. For the sake of remaining anonymous, I will refer to my friend as F. 

So I am a survivor of childhood cancer. Had it as a teenager, went through treatment and I’ve been in remission now for a few years. When I was going through treatment as a kid, I wanted to just run away from it all and tried my best not really think about what was happening in my life at the time. I was aware of a support group here locally in my city, and had been invited to be a part of it many times but I just wasn’t interested. Fast forward a few years, and as a young adult I realized how alone I felt. Dealing with the long term physical side effects of chemotherapy and carrying around all the trauma and mental health issues that became a part of my life post treatment. So, I decided to give it a shot and started going to the club meetings. They’re only once a month, so it wasn’t too much of a commitment. At first I felt really awkward and uncomfortable because I didn’t know anybody. But I slowly started to from a few friendships and acquaintances here and there. Luckily, I’ve been able to find a couple of really solid people that I would consider friends. It felt so good to have people to talk to about things that my ‘normal’ friends just can’t relate to or understand. 

So anyways, somewhere along the way I ended up becoming friends with this one girl who we will call F at he end of 2022 or maybe beginning of 2023 idk. We would text here and there and talk to each other at the events and meetings. I ended up developing a crush on her. We ended up going on one ‘date’ I guess you could call it. But it was kind of like us just hanging out. We had a picnic and talked for a few hours. I will admit that I did buy her flowers so there was definitely romantic intentions behind that I won’t lie. But anyways, we had a good time and she had told me that she wanted to go thrifting together and that I should stop by her work and get a fruit bowl or something (she works at a coffee shop). We did text back and forth for a bit after but she was slow to respond majority of the time. Which I don’t think was anything personal. She juggles college, a job and a hobby of hers that consumes a lot of her time. Her best friend also told me that that’s just how she is and she’s slow to respond to texts from everyone. So yeah, I started to lose interest and pulled back and stopped pursuing and I guess things just kinda fizzled out. Her or I would usually text the other person around the time of when another meeting was coming up to see if the other was going or not. We would see each other every now and then and make small talk/catch up at meetings but that was all. We ended up just being friends. We didn’t hang out outside of the support group or club (whatever you wanna call it) again. 

Fast forward to the end of 2023 and I ended up meeting a different girl through a dating app that would go on to become my girlfriend. And we’ve been together since. I would say that for the first few months of our relationship things were not exactly very stable. We broke up a few times but always got back together. To be fair, we both admit that we were a complete mess when we met each other. Neither of us were in a good place mentally. Now, I’m not trying to blame her but this is objectively true and she even admits it herself. My girlfriend was emotionally immature for her age and didn’t really know how to have a healthy relationship which is what lead to the majority of our fighting. Like for example, communication was a big issue. And I think that these kinds of issues stemmed from the fact that she had only had one relationship in her life prior to me and it was a very toxic one that she was not happy in. But over time and through therapy, she has grown a lot and improved massively in the areas she needed to. And me as well. I was dealing with the death of my mom as well as depression and anxiety. I would say that for the past 9 months things have been stable and solid. We’ve grown so much together and as of right now I’d say that we are 100% locked in. 

But now, here’s where the sticky situation starts. So back when I first met my girlfriend, I was in the process of writing a fiction book that was based on my life and so I was basically the main character. At the time, we had just met and she wanted to know what I do in my free time so I shared with her that I was writing a book. She asked if she could read it, so I sent her a copy of what I had so far. She only read maybe like the first 1 or 2 chapters and then never got to the rest of it. Which is fine because I ended up losing interest in writing the book and never finished it. 

Now, this ended up coming back to bite me in the butt. I don’t know why but for some reason, recently my girlfriend decided to read more of the book. And eventually, she got to the chapter where I talked about little time period of my life where I was crushing on F. She asked me about it and I felt so bad because I had lied to her. Whenever she had asked about F in the past I never told her about the fact that I had a crush on her at one point. I had told her that we were just friends. Now, I know that this was wrong and I should have been honest with her from the start. But I figured that since I no longer have any romantic feelings or interest in F and nothing ever really happened between us besides some flirting here and there and that one picnic we had, that it was best not to tell her about it. Because I knew that it would cause her to feel insecure and it would cause drama and the cancer club is supposed to be a safe space for me. So the last thing I wanted was for my girlfriend to not want me to go to the meetings because she knows that F will be there or stuff like that. I just knew that it would cause unnecessary drama and I didn’t want any of that. So I withheld certain information. But now that she read that chapter of the book and knew the truth, things changed. And I apologized to her and acknowledged that I shouldn’t have lied to her and I explained why I felt it was best to not tell her about the things that I hid. Of course she was upset, but she understood and forgave me and we moved on. However, I guess deep down she was burying a lot of feelings regarding the situation. Obviously I knew that the friendship between me and F made my girlfriend uncomfortable but I didn’t know how bad it was. In my mind, the drama had died down because I stopped going to the club meetings anyway for the majority of the last year because my health has not been the best and also, I just have other things going on in my life right now. So the topic didn’t really come up again.

But, about a week ago was the club’s annual trip to Disneyland. Which is a nice thing that the lady in charge of the club puts together with the help of some sponsors. It’s a free trip to Disneyland. It’s something nice and special that we all look forward to every year. They pick us up on a bus and drive us there and back. Our tickets are paid for and we even get gift cards to help pay for whatever food or souvenirs we want while we’re there. 

So anyways, I already knew that this trip was going to be triggering for my girlfriend since F was going to be there. Now I want to explain to you all the social dynamics of the situation. I would say that in total there were maybe 100-200 people on this trip. But we do not move around the park in one large group. We are broken up into smaller groups. There is one chaperone for every 6 participants. So the groups are either groups of 6 or 12. Now originally, we had our entire group planned out. And yes, F was going to be in my group. I will explain why in a bit. But anyways, like 2 days before the trip, my other friend who I would say I am the closest to out of everyone in the club gets covid and can’t go. So he pulls out and that changes the whole group. Because he was the glue. Half of the other people in our group were more so his friends than mine. So when he told us he wasn’t going, people broke off into other groups. So my group ended up consisting of 12 people however I really only knew 3 of them. One is F and the other two are males. The other 9 people that got thrown into our group I didn’t really know at all. So I stuck with who I knew. So within the group of 12 was a group of 4. Now, to explain why F was in my group and not a different group. The thing about this cancer club is that there are little groups or cliques within the club as a whole. And I think that’s normal and happens in any sort of large group of people. It can be kind of awkward to navigate if you are shy. F happens to be a shy person. And so she does know some other people within the club but I would say that out of all of them, I’m who she’s closest to. She doesn’t really go out of her way to strike up conversation and socialize with other people. So since I’m basically her only actual friend in the club, she naturally gravitates towards me. That’s just the way it’s always been. And I understand why. Because it’s awkward to sit next to people you don’t know as a shy person because you will just sit there awkwardly in silence. And so because I understand her position, I try my best to include her in things. Whatever group I end up in for a trip or activity is the group she ends up in as well. 

So this trip to Disney was no different. I even communicated that she was going to be in my group to my girlfriend before the trip so that she knew. And I made sure to reassure my girlfriend that nothing is going to happen and that I only want her and that I’m not interested in F. I had many conversations with her about it. I even sent her a nice text message reassuring her the morning of, and I texted her throughout the day so she wouldn’t feel ignored. I did everything I possibly could have to try and calm her nerves. But it didn’t work. At around 8pm while we’re eating dinner, I get a text message from my girlfriend. It’s a zoomed in screenshot of a group photo that the cancer club had posted on Instagram. I was in shock and also confused. Because I didn’t even know they had posted any photos of the trip. Usually it takes them a few days. But anyways I went to the clubs Instagram and sure enough they posted a group photo of all 100-200 of us. And my girlfriend took the time to stalk their page which she doesn’t even follow, saw the new group photo, screenshotted it and zoomed into the corner where I was standing and sent it to me. And of course it had to do with F. F was standing next to me in the photo. Her message was something along the lines of ‘why is she standing next to you? And why does she feel comfortable being so close to you.’ My initial reaction was ‘bro, this girl is crazy😭.’ At the time I didn’t respond because I was eating dinner at a table with everyone and I didn’t anyone to see these angry text messages. As well as the fact that I was exhausted. I didn’t sleep at all the night before the trip and at this point I had been awake for over 30 hours with no sleep. Later on when I had a brief moment to myself, I texted her trying to calm her down and give her some context but I told her we would talk more about it later because I have to go. We were on a time crunch. We still had to shop for gifts and make it back to the bus on time. So anyways, we finish up at Disney and the bus takes us to our cars and I drive home. So this is hours later I get home and I finally get to sit down and text her properly. I texted her a little bit and she said that she wanted to come over to my house the next day to talk about it in person. I agreed. But at this point I felt like the whole thing had been blown out of proportion and I was not looking forward to our conversation.

Anyways, the next day comes around and she’s at my house and we get to talking. I suggest that she speaks her peace first and she accepts. So she starts just going off. Immediately her tone is aggressive, loud and she’s swearing over and over again which is extremely out of character for her. She never curses. And every question she asked, I answered. “Why was she standing next to you in the photo?” My response, “Well, when you take a group of photo of like 200 people in front of the magic kingdom you have to be quick because everyone is trying to take pictures. And F was pushing my wheelchair all day so naturally we ended up just standing next to each other.” Also, keep in mind guys we weren’t even touching or anything. Literally just standing still and smiling at the camera. Then she starts asking other questions. “I bet she sat next to you on the bus. Didn’t she? Yeah that’s what I thought. Now tell me why. Why did you sit next to her?” My response was me explaining the social dynamics of the group and how I’m basically F’s only friend there. And my girlfriend’s response was “I don’t give a *bleep*! Why do you care? Why are you her savior? Why do you feel the need to do that?” And then I explain to her that this is literally a club for teens and young adults with cancer and it’s meant to be inclusive to everyone. And so I’m not going to go out of my way to exclude someone or make them feel awkward or uncomfortable. And it’s not just F. I’ve done this with several other people especially new people who come to their first meeting and I can tell they’re feeling a bit awkward or left out I will invite them to sit next to me and talk to them and introduce them to people. Like I’m literally just trying to be welcoming and inclusive. This is not the place to exclude people. But anyways this goes on and on for like 2 hours. And basically, she demands that I block her on everything. My girlfriend essentially gave me an ultimatum and told me that I have to block F on Instagram and delete her phone number from my contacts or else we’re breaking up. And I was just like bruh. Oh, I forgot to add that during this whole conversation, whenever she wanted to talk I let her finish her points. Whenever I talked, I was always interrupted and yelled at. So by the end of it I was now angry and I was raising my voice and telling her that this is not ok what she’s doing and that I’ve tried to stay calm and respectful this whole time while she was interrupting, yelling and cussing at me. But anyways, so yeah not only does she want me to block F on everything but there’s more. I told her that if I’m going to do that then I will need to send F a long text message explaining everything to her because she is my friend and I’m not just going to block her without communicating why because that’s rude. My girlfriend says that’s fine but demands that she wants to read the text message before I send it. She wants to be able to make me edit it and change things if she doesn’t like certain parts. And then once I make a final draft that she sees as acceptable, I can send it. 

Now guys, I don’t know about y’all but I feel like the ‘solution’ that she sees fit for this situation has everything to do with making her happy but not me. I explained to her that ok, if this is really what you want then I will do it but understand the damage that you are causing. The reason why these friendships with other cancer patients are so important to me is because it allows me to feel normal. There’s things that I talk to my cancer friends about that can’t talk to my ‘normal’ friends or my girlfriend about. And even if I tried they just wouldn’t get it. All they can do is empathize but they can’t relate. These friendships are important for my mental health. Like, I’ll cut off F if I have to but I’m getting screwed over here. I understand that as my girlfriend’s partner it is my responsibility to make sure that she feels comfortable and secure in our relationship. And I have no problem doing what it takes to achieve that. But now, we’re getting into a territory where in order to achieve that I have to lose meaningful friendships. Not even to mention the drama and how freaking awkward it’s going to be if I do this. Like bro, seeing each other at the next meeting is going to be awkward as heck. And tbh knowing how shy F is, I wouldn’t be surprised if she just stopped going to the cancer club all together. And I don’t want that. I think that’s kinda sad. It’s important for her to be a part of the community too. 

Now I will admit, in the past I did have my girlfriend cut off a ‘guy friend’ of hers from high school. And she did. Sent him a long text explaining why and blocked him. But that was an entirely different situation. The guy had a crush on her since high school and was basically just one of those sad, desperate dudes waiting in the friend zone for years praying and hoping that one day the girl will like them back. He would call her all drunk, crying and yapping about how he’s sad and lonely and needs a girl. Last year, he texted her on Valentine’s Day offering to buy her flowers and that was the final straw. I already knew that dude was waiting around like a little creep and he finally overstepped a boundary to where I was like nah he gotta go. So I feel like that’s a very different situation.

F knows I have a girlfriend and has never tried to make any advances on me or flirt with me since I’ve started dating my girlfriend. And I don’t flirt or try to make any advances either. We are platonic friends. Neither of us are trying to buy the other person flowers on Valentine’s Day or any other inappropriate stuff.

So although, it may seem like the situations are similar and there’s a bit of a double standard going on here, I beg to differ. The situation where she had to drop her ‘guy friend’ was wildly different from this situation with F. And she tried to compare the two situations like as if they’re the same but I don’t think they are.

What also frustrated me is how she assumed that I was flirting with F the whole day at Disney. And I was like bruh. Not even close. I was actually talking about my girlfriend half the time and spent the entire day going in and out of every gift shop trying to find her something cute that’s related to stitch. And the other half of the time we were talking about our health and life circumstances. And yeah, banter as well. And it wasn’t like I was alone with F. We were in a group the entire time. 

I know that my girlfriend has never met F so she doesn’t know much about her. Which probably doesn’t help. She probably sees her as a threat when in reality she’s not. F actually told the group in a conversation at Disney that she isn’t ready for a relationship at this point in her life and isn’t looking for one. Oh yeah, another thing I forgot to add, F is cool and I don’t mind having her as a friend but the more I’ve gotten to know her, the more I’ve realized that we wouldn’t even be compatible in a romantic relationship. We have different beliefs and opinions as well as attachment styles. I have anxious attachment and I can tell that she is an avoidant. Recipe for disaster. So I really have zero romantic interest in her. It’s strictly platonic. And I know my girlfriend may think she is but she’s not some wicked evil person either, I mean she literally pushed me around in a wheelchair for like 12 hours straight. (Kind off topic but no, I’m not paralyzed or have had any of my limbs amputated. The cancer I had was in my lungs and I have asthma as well so walking around for too long is hard for me which is why I was in a wheelchair. Just thought I’d throw that in there in case anyone was curious.)

But anyways, I totally understand my girlfriend’s perspective. And her feelings of insecurity and uncomfortability are 100% valid and normal and I’ve told her that. And I apologized for causing her to feel that way. And I do understand that when you are in a relationship you should always prioritize your partner if you are serious about them. And yes, I am serious about my girlfriend and do want a future with her. I love her so much and I really truly do want to be with her. And like I said, if I have to, I will cut off F for the sake of making my girlfriend feel more secure and comfortable. But I feel torn. As of right now I’ve told her that I will send F the text and then block her but I just need time to sit down and write it because these last few days have been hectic and I’ve been busy and haven’t had the time. But honestly, the more I think about it the more frustrated I get because I don’t want to do it. Because I feel like it’s unnecessary. And like I’m being forced to do it. And the fall out of this will just be very unpleasant. Might I also add that yes I know a handful of people in the cancer club that I would consider friends. However, the people I actually have a closer friendship with are my friend that pulled out of the trip with Covid and F. And I used to hang out with the Covid friend and his group of friends at the meetings but I’ve stopped hanging out with them because a lot of them are in their late teens and can be annoying and disrespectful at times due to their immaturity. So as of right now, I think I’m more likely to sit with F at the next meeting rather than my Covid friend (sorry I keep calling him that but I just never gave him an initial for this story😭) because he hangs out with a group of rude and annoying jerks. 

So yeah, truthfully I would like to have one more conversation with my girlfriend about the whole situation and see if we can find a compromise where we both feel like we walk away from the situation feeling happy, comfortable and secure. But I’m scared to even approach the topic again with any sort of push back because I’m afraid she will freak out again or threaten to break up or both. What should I do? Any advice or suggestions? Sorry if this was too long but I wanted to give you guys the full picture.


(TLDR : my girlfriend wants me to cut off a friend of mine but I’m unsure as to what I should do.)

The espresso roasting game in the desert is on point in Phoenix. So many small roasters popping up, and the flavor profiles are wild. Some of the most interesting beans I’ve tried in a while.

I don't know if Arizona is somewhere that people think about looking for freshly roasted beans and good espresso. I know I didn't. But seriously check out some of the Phoenix-area roasters. We’ve been super impressed and keep finding new ones to try.

Anyone else in AZ got roaster recs? Would love to hear what you’re brewing! And if anyone wants a rec..I have some :) ☕✨

Ever roll out of bed and wonder how to make today just *a little bit better* than yesterday? I used to hit the snooze button like it owed me money and pick up my phone before I even washed my face. But one small change turned that all around for me. Wanna know what it is?

**Ask yourself: What’s the one thing I can do today that’ll make everything else easier or unnecessary?** 🤔

Sounds simple, right? But this magic question flips your perspective on what actually matters! 

Let me tell you a quick story about last Tuesday. My to-do list was looking more like a dissertation. I started to panic, but then reminded myself of this question. Boom! Realized that tackling one pesky email thread first would remove a chain of later tasks. 

**So here’s why this question rocks:**

- **Focuses Your Energy**: It's like casting a Patronus spell on overwhelm. You streamline your day to the one thing that will make a difference.
  
- **Cuts Down the Clutter**: Ever felt like you’re putting out fires rather than doing meaningful work? This stops you from doing a million tiny things and lets you concentrate on the big fish.

- **Boosts Your Confidence**: Imagine finishing that one thing and realizing half the stress has melted away. Your inner superstar literally high-fives you. 🎉

- **Creates Momentum**: Productivity isn’t just about getting things done—it's about getting the right things done. One solid move sets the flow for the rest of the day.

*But...* what if nothing comes to mind? Ask yourself: ""If I can only get one thing right today, what do I want it to be?"" Often, clarity lurks behind what we initially think is important. 😎

**Quick Tips to Keep This Habit Alive:**

- Write the question on a sticky note and slap it on your bathroom mirror or fridge.
- Make it a morning ritual with your coffee or tea (whichever fuels your superpowers).
  
And hey, we all have those sluggish mornings where even the best habits feel like a mountain climb. Remember, just asking this question already sets the right intent for your day.

Do any of you have a morning question or ritual that amps up your productivity? Drop your thoughts or stories, wild or mundane, because that's what this community is all about—fueling each other’s adventures in greatness! 🚀✨",1,1738878322.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

# [GoldSpin](https://australiacasinos.online/casinos/goldspin): Unearthing Real Money Riches in a Brand New Aussie Online Casino

[GoldSpin: Strike gold with this bonus!](https://preview.redd.it/mfh0jnu68lhe1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e14a1075f056546b4e960c9872d8c9914ca37c9)

GoldSpin Casino is the *newest* kid on the block, launching in September *2025*. It's already making waves in the Australian gambling scene, attracting players like blowflies to a barbie.

GoldSpin doesn't mess around when it comes to welcoming new *Australian players*. They've got a three-part *welcome bonus* that could score you up to A$3000 *plus* 100 free spins. That's enough to make you feel like you've found a gold nugget the size of your fist at this promising *casino site*! This is a competitive *deposit bonus* offering.

**The GoldSpin Experience: The Good, the Not-So-Good, and the Potential**

**What Makes GoldSpin Shine Like Gold:**

* A *ridiculous* library of over 7000 games! You could play a different game every day for years and still not get through them all. Includes plenty of *table games* too.
* Over 20 *bonuses*, covering both *casino* games and sports betting – they're practically throwing free money at you. One of the *best* for *bonus* variety.
* A 5-level VIP program that rewards loyal players like royalty.
* A solid sportsbook for when you fancy a punt on something other than the pokies.
* Support in multiple languages, including, of course, Aussie English. Making it a top *Australian online casino* contender.

**What Needs a Bit More Time in the Smelter:**

* **Heads Up:** Their Curacao license is still *pending*. This means they're not *fully* regulated yet, so proceed with a bit of caution. (More on this below). It is a popular license for a *gambling site.*
* The sheer number of games might be overwhelming for newbies. It's like walking into the biggest pub in *Australia* and not knowing where to start!

**Pokie Paradise: A Glimpse at GoldSpin's Top Treasures**

GoldSpin is packed with more pokies than you can shake a stick at. Here are a few of the standouts offering decent *payout* percentages:

**Beyond the Welcome: Bonuses That Keep on Giving**

GoldSpin keeps the good times (and the *bonuses*) coming long after you've signed up. They've got promotions, free spins, and special *casino offers* galore. Check out their ""Crazy Cashback"" (up to A$500 every week) and the ""Casino Weekly Reload"" (50% up to A$250) – it's like having a mate who's always shouting you a *bonus*.

**Security: Taking it Seriously (But Still Getting Their Ducks in a Row)**

GoldSpin *says* they take security seriously, and they offer a good range of secure payment options, including crypto. **However, and this is important, that Curacao license is still pending.** While they seem committed to fair play, it's worth remembering that they're not fully licensed yet. Think of it like this: they're building a house, the foundations are laid, but the roof isn't quite on yet. This is important if you are *looking for the best* and most secure experience.

**The Final Verdict: Is GoldSpin a** ***Best Casino*** **Worth Prospecting?**

GoldSpin *Casino* has a *lot* to offer: a mountain of games, a generous *welcome bonus*, and a user-friendly platform. It's definitely one of the most exciting new *online casinos* in *Australia*. *However*, the pending license is a significant factor to consider, especially for those *looking for a solid gambling* experience, fully licensed and regulated.

Here's the deal: If you're a seasoned gambler who understands the risks and rewards of playing at a newly launched *online casino*, GoldSpin could be a goldmine. But if you're new to *online gambling* or prefer to stick with fully established, fully licensed *casinos*, it might be best to wait and see how GoldSpin develops. It's like trying a new beer – it might be your new favourite, or you might prefer to stick with your usual. It has the potential to be a *real money online casino* if their license is approved.

Give it a burl? Maybe. But keep your wits about you, and don't bet more than you can afford to lose. Explore other *online casino* options too.

Okay, I've carefully reviewed the GoldSpin section again, incorporating as many of the provided keywords as possible *while maintaining the natural, conversational, Aussie-focused tone*. This is a tricky balancing act, as overstuffing keywords can make the text sound robotic and unnatural, which is the *opposite* of what we want for Reddit.

# Your Burning Questions About Aussie Online Casinos Answered

**What is the** ***best online casino in Australia*** **for** ***real money***\*\*?\*\*

There's no single ""best"" *casino*, as it depends on your preferences. However, based on our research, King Billy, HellSpin, and QuickWin consistently rank highly. They offer a great combination of game variety, generous bonuses, secure platforms, and fast payouts. Ultimately, the *best online casino Australia real money* experience is the one that suits *you* best.

**What** ***Australian online casino*** **pays out the most?**

""Payout"" can mean a few things. If you're talking about the highest Return to Player (RTP) percentages across all games, it's tough to pinpoint one *casino*. Many top *casinos* offer games with RTPs in the 96-98% range. If you mean which *casino* has processed the biggest single wins, that information isn't publicly available (and it's largely down to luck!). Look for *casinos* with a good reputation for fast and reliable withdrawals, like King Billy and HellSpin.

**Which** ***online casino*** **is the most trustworthy?**

Trustworthiness comes down to licensing, security, and a proven track record. King Billy (licensed by Curacao) and QuickWin both have strong reputations. Generally, *casinos* licensed by Curacao, Malta (MGA), or the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) are considered reputable, though the UKGC doesn't directly apply to Aussie players. *Always* do your own research before depositing money.

**What is the** ***best online pokies*** **to play in** ***Australia***\*\*?\*\*

This depends on what you enjoy! For high RTP, ""Outback Odyssey"" (mentioned in our QuickWin review) is a good option. For exciting gameplay and big win potential, ""Starburst XXXtreme,"" ""Book of Dead,"" and ""Wolf Treasure"" are consistently popular. For a uniquely Aussie theme, try something like ""Outback Heat"" or ""Roo Riches.""

**What is the** ***best online pokie site*** **in** ***Australia*** **for** ***real money***\*\*?\*\*

Again, it's subjective, but King Billy, HellSpin, and QuickWin all offer *massive* selections of pokies from top providers. They also have user-friendly websites and good mobile experiences. GoldSpin is also a great contender, especially if you like having thousands of options.

**What is the** ***best online casino in Australia*** **for PayID withdrawal?**

While PayID is becoming increasingly popular, not all *Australian online casinos* offer it as a withdrawal method yet. From our reviewed casinos your best shot is most likely at Quickwin. However, many offer fast withdrawals via other methods, like e-wallets (Skrill, Neteller) and cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum). Always check the *casino's* banking page for their specific withdrawal options and processing times. It is becoming more popular.

Okay, let's polish this final section, keeping the tone, adding a bit more detail, and ensuring everything is accurate and helpful.

**Final Thoughts and Essential Resources: Your Toolkit for Aussie** ***Online Casino*** **Fun**

You can find more information on the **Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)** website. \[Insert ACMA website link here - [www.acma.gov.au\]](http://www.acma.gov.au])

**Playing at Offshore Casinos: Know the Risks (and Rewards)**

Many *online casinos* that accept *Australian players* are based offshore. While this doesn't automatically make them dodgy, it's important to understand that *Australian* consumer protection laws might not apply. However, many reputable offshore *casinos* are licensed by respected international regulators (like the Curacao Gaming Authority or the Malta Gaming Authority) and have strong security measures in place. *Always* do your research and choose *casinos* with a good reputation.

1ijebtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MagnificentCentury/comments/1ijebtd/the_tragedy_of_bayezid_in_kösem_season_2/,The Tragedy of Bayezid in Kösem season 2,"It's time to share my thoughts on the tragedy of my favorite Sehzade. 

From the very beginning, Bayezid’s position is difficult. After Osman’s death, he is the only remaining children of the dynasty who is not Kösem’s biological child. Unlike Osman, who lost his mother as a baby and never knew her, Bayezid had been raised by his mother, Gülbahar, for around eight years before she was exiled for plotting a coup, which was likely true but Kosem lacked convincing evidence when she condemned her so Bayezid could easily believe it was all fake. During all those years, Bayezid lived without her, growing up under Kosem with her children, yet never truly belonged. 

Kösem insists that she always treated Bayezid as her own son, but her actions tell another story. Even before she knew about Gülbahar’s return, she already viewed him with suspicion, warning her allies to ""keep an eye on him."" The moment he makes one mistake—revealing Kasım’s secret to his mother in a desperate attempt to keep her in Istanbul—she discards him, telling him that they stand together for the last time, when she would forgive her real children for similar things (like Atike’s action leading to Gevrehan for example). And every time they interacted with each other, even in their first scene, you can tell there’s a distance between them. 

We can also see that he never truly belongs with his siblings as well. He is conspicuously absent from significant family moments, even in the beginning, we see he is not there when all the siblings (except Murad of course) gather to comfort Gevherhan after Murad executed her husband. Throughout the series, his estrangement with them grows larger and larger and he shares fewer and fewer scenes with them (he’s notably completely absent at Atike’s wedding). 

Among his siblings, Kasım is his most relentless adversary. From the start, he resents Bayezid’s closeness to Murad and the Janissaries’ acclaim for him as heir. His jealousy is palpable, driving him to attack Bayezid unprovoked (when he accused him of being happy Murad ended Kosem’s regency out of nowhere) and he always runs to Kösem with any information that might cast him in a bad light. And he did those things before Bayezid betrayed his secret. 

Bayezid’s fatal mistake—sharing Kasım’s secret with Gülbahar—was an act of naivety and desperation, as Gulbahar was going to be sent back into exile and she told him Kosem was going to have her killed on the road. He never imagined it would escalate to Murad locking Kasım away with their deranged uncle, an excessive punishment considering the relatively minor nature of the offense (Murad had never even had contact with Esmanur before). But the consequences are dire: Kösem grows even colder toward him, Kasım becomes his sworn enemy, and Bayezid is left drowning in guilt. 

One of the saddest things about Bayezid is that he is caught between two loyalties, two families: his siblings and Kosem on one side, and his mother on the other. But honestly, his mother is the only one who displays unconditional love towards him. Kosem never truly saw him as a son, Murad is too busy asserting his authority and doing whatever with Farya and is becoming more cruel and emotionally distant by the hour, Kasim hates him, Ibrahim turns his back on him after his mistake, he is not close with either of his sisters. It’s no wonder he is so attached to his mother, especially since her absence was like a hole inside him for so long. 

Also while Gülbahar displays unconditional love for him and I do believe she loved him, she also manipulates him emotionally a lot (feigning illnesses) and treats him as a pawn in her power plays. Because while it’s true she wants to enthrone him to ensure his safety and she has a point, she is also power-hungry. That much is clear when upon hearing that the secret Jesuit cult has chosen a future Grand Vizier for Bayezid’s reign, she indignantly declares, “How dare they? Only *I* choose the Grand Vizier.” Her, not her son the sultan would have the true power in her dreams. 

Bayezid, however, is not a willing usurper. He loves his brother and wants to be loyal to him (poor boy). He tries to dissuade her from conspiring, but he cannot bring himself to betray her, nor can he let go of the hope that they can simply be mother and son. And then things just keep on escalating, with Gülbahar’s plans culminating in the Great Fire of Istanbul and then a triple murder attempt on Murad, Kasim, and Ibrahim. 

Gülbahar’s treachery is exposed, and I don’t think it was unfair to condemn her to death, her role in the Great Fire of Istanbul caused countless deaths and widespread suffering, but to Bayezid, she is his mother, the person he loves the most in the world and for whom he would sacrifice anything. His grief is overwhelming, and in his desperation, he devises a plan to fake her death and send her away to safety. But Gülbahar has no intention of leaving. She is too entangled in her quest for power, as well as having legitimate fears for Bayezid’s safety, to disappear quietly. 

I really hated the way the family (apart from maybe Ibrahim) reacted to Bayezid’s grief. Kasım mocks him and says he should have been executed too. Murad reminds him that the dynasty, not his mother, is his true family. His sisters are nowhere to be found. Kösem acknowledges his pain but tells him to move on and laments that he doesn’t see her as his mother (despite her never truly seeing him as her son). Seriously I get where’s coming from in telling him not to choose anger but her saying “she is your mother but didn’t I become your mother too” when she was distant from him all season was annoying and unnecessary. This isn’t about you mam. 

Kasım’s relentless campaign against him culminates in catastrophe for Bayezid: he uncovers the secret of Gülbahar’s survival and tells Kösem. Despite having no proof beyond Kasım’s word, Kösem desecrates her tomb to confirm the truth. This act alone speaks volumes about her true feelings toward Bayezid: she was never truly willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Bayezid’s one solace was Kalika, one of the only genuinely pure and sweet love stories in both shows. Their relationship was doomed from the start: a prince could not have relationships, she was a free woman, and she ran a tavern on top of that when Murad outlawed everything from coffee to tobacco to alcohol, making their love triply forbidden. Murad, who hypocritically condemned people to death for selling alcohol while being an alcoholic himself (also in general just terrible at following Islam principles despite him constantly bragging about being “The Shadow of Allah on Earth”), forced Bayezid to execute the woman he loved. It was an act of pure cruelty, designed to break him completely after Kasim told him Bayezid was conspiring him against him. These words were not enough for Murad to decide to condemn Bayezid himself, but still he wanted to break him into submission.  Kasım’s reaction—mocking him yet again—only deepened his isolation.

Bayezid didn’t really had anything else to lose, he was estranged from his siblings, he was estranged from Kosem, he could never be with his mother, and Kalika was dead. So he finally did what he had resisted for so long: he embraced the conspiracy against Murad. Unfortunately, he failed. And he could have run away with Sinan’s help and found refuge in Persia, and fight for the throne, but he decided against a war that would devastate his country, and accepted death.

He gave me a copy when I was in his office the other day. Hooray! On the way back to the car from my appointment, I passed a bank branch (rare in my country cos it’s mostly all online banking now) and remembered I had 2 cheques in my  wallet that I’d been carting round for aaaages that I needed to deposit. So went in, only to discover that the cheques were now two years old and out of date. 

Left the bank despondently, and the teller rushed after me yelling “Wait! You forgot your book!!”, brandishing “Success With ADHD” above her head. Sighed, accepted book with thanks, bought a coffee in the way back to the car. 

Realised I had no idea where I had parked the car, and in the looong flustered mission to find it in the massive mall multistory car park, forgot I was holding a (now cold) coffee and spilled it all over “Success With ADHD”. Found the car, accidentally left my coffee on the roof, and drove off. 

Made it home uncaffeinated, told my family this funny story. My daughter asked if she could borrow “Success With ADHD” and I said of course, please excuse all the coffee stains. Except… I’ve lost it. Got home, put it down somewhere, and “Success With ADHD”  disappeared into a black hole.

But planning your day doesn’t have to be an epic saga starring a 20-item to-do list. Here’s how I go from hot-mess-express to semi-organized human in about five minutes:

1. **The Brain Dump**  
   Jot down everything rattling around in your head—ideas, appointments, grocery lists, that random thought about rewatching your favorite TV show. Don’t overthink it. Just get it out.

2. **Pick Your Non-Negotiables**  
   Out of all that scribble, highlight the one or two tasks you absolutely *must* tackle today. For me, that might be finishing a report or finally scheduling that dentist appointment (why do I always put this off?).

3. **Chunk It Down**  
   Break those tasks into baby steps. “Finish presentation slides” can be mini-labeled as: gather data, design layout, review with a friend. Takes a bit of the intimidation factor away.

4. **Give It a Time Slot**  
   Think about your day like a puzzle. Where can you fit in tasks without losing your mind? Even just a rough estimate—like 30 minutes during lunch break—can help avoid the “I’ll just do it later” trap.

5. **Sprinkle in Something Fun**  
   No day plan feels right without a treat. Block out a little me-time (coffee run, video game break, or a quick walk) so you don’t lose steam by midday. Keeps you motivated and actually looking forward to ticking things off.

You know what’s funny? Whenever I skip these steps, I end up scrolling social media for an hour, convinced “I have no time.” Then my day spirals. But when I do these simple five-minute planning sessions, I magically discover pockets of time I never knew existed.

I used to think planning was only for super-organized folks who color-code their sock drawers. Turns out, all it takes is a quick brain dump, a couple of real priorities, and a dash of creativity to keep the chaos at bay.

- **Shovel first**. Clear all snow from driveways and sidewalks before it turns to ice. Salt should only be used after the snow is removed and only in areas needed for safety.

- Apply roughly **one 12oz coffee cup of salt per 500sq ft / 10 sidewalk squares**. Distribute salt evenly, not in clumps. If you see salt left over after snow and ice clears, you've used too much! Sweep up excess salt so it doesn't make its way into the ecosystem.

- Check the forecast! **If the temperature is above 32°F (0°C), salt is unnecessary** since ice will melt naturally.

- Consider using sand (or a mix of salt and sand) instead! Sand can be a better choice on hills, sloped driveways, or busy walkways where traction is the key problem. Also near vegetation, water sources, or structures where salt pollution or corrosion is a concern.

Real world example: In my area today it snowed <1"" and I see it's ~36°F this afternoon with the snow steadily melting. Tonight there's a forecasted low of 26°F, so sometime this evening I will carefully apply a little salt to high-traffic areas so that the snow runoff doesn't freeze into black ice.

I recently tried using ChatGPT to find it and I genuinely think I broke it -- it decided to start saying ""yeah I'll keep working on it I promise"". What I remember about it is as follows:

Source: I am 99% sure I came across it on Youtube.

Time period: I think the 2010s, but could easily be 00s.

Musical characteristics: I would probably describe it as indie/alternative rock. It had the usual guitar, drums etc I believe. It could've included keyboards or piano. I don't think it had synth but possibly. It was pretty slow and subdued but I remember the chorus having a bit more intensity.

Themes and lyrics: I think it was about infidelity/cheating. I can't remember if it was the singer cheating or the other person cheating. I am 80% sure it included reference to times, like at 1am this happens, at 2am this happens, at 5am etc, but I can't remember exactly what times or how many times. I strongly associate this song with something happening in the AM. I'm pretty sure this time/times were in the chorus. It may have also had lyrics to do with coffee. Generally quite a lonely, loss vibe, maybe...

If it helps, the following artists/songs put this song back on the tip of my tongue:

* Passengers - Let Her Go: Not so much the musical style but the singer's voice
* Silversun Pickups - Lazy Eyes: This is way more rocky than what I remember the song to be, but the voice and general vibe reminds me of it.
* Elliot Smith - 2:45AM: Mostly because every time I try and remember the song lyrics and sing it to myself I inadvertently hear this instead.
* Cigarettes After Sex, generally: To be honest I keep thinking it's a song from them, especially the voice, but the music is a bit more slow and subtle than the song I remember. It might also be because the words ""cigarettes"", ""after"" or ""sex"" might be in the chorus. I wouldn't say I've listened to every CAS song though so if it turns out to be one of their songs I'll go cry.

I need help sorting this because I feel not ok, I have had a tornado going off in my brain for 24 hours.

  
I am in the process of divorcing a CN. Married 26 years. Yesterday he was in sort of a manic like state, hyper, talking and he went to go to our neighbors. He was there for quite some time until he came home all messed up panicking. I asked him what was wrong and he said he needed his anxiety meds and if I wanted to talk to him to follow him to the living room. I did because he was in a very strange state and I was worried.

I shut down my computer and followed him and when I got into the room he looked strange, was obviously panicking and he was calling himself a piece of shit, which is very unusual. I asked what was going on, so he tells me he was over at the neighbors and was discussing his activities on a dating site (I am aware of it and I don't care). He met this girl who apparently looks like our neighbors daughter. Apparently he was telling our neighbor (the girls mother) about this and ended up saying something which I personally find very inappropriate. 

Right as he is saying this our neighbors husband comes home from work and the daughter comes out from the back crying saying she has no wall to her bedroom and she could hear everything. Apparently my spouse went on to try and explain what he was saying and ended up saying worse things at which point he said he was sorry and bailed. 

He finishes telling me all of this and gives me a panic attack so I try to calm myself down and figure out what the hell is going on. He asks me to please go to the neighbors and explain to them he is on so much medication for his injuries (he is) and he does not know why he said what he did (I believe this).

But now we have an issue because our neighborhood is small and regardless of reason I do not feel comfortable with what was said. I go over to the neighbors and have a conversation with them. The mother had apparently been shocked into stunned silence and hadn't said anything, the husband had already had the impression that something was going haywire with my spouse so while he was not comfortable with what was said he could understand there was a problem but asked that my spouse not come to visit unless he was there. 

I agreed to all of this and I told them I do not believe in any way my spouse ever do anything and truly feel there is something going wrong. He has never acted like this before but regardless I asked them to please tell their daughter that I was devastated she had to hear any of that and no matter what happens I would look out for her. I also told them if they had any issue with my spouse or anything to please contact me. They agreed and did not seem overly upset and understood something was going wrong.

My problem is later on in the day my spouse started to get pissed off for being misjudged (I think this is the CN coming out). How none of them checked in on him after his injury. How no one ever wanted to hang out with him or invited him over and on and on. He asked my opinion on the situation which I refused to give at first because he wouldn't like it. He ended up forcing me to give my opinion, so I get yelled at. To me this felt like he was trying any way he could to not have to feel like he did something wrong. I told him adults are responsible for knowing right from wrong and holding to those boundaries. Then I disengaged and went to bed.

Now onto this morning. I get up and go to get coffee. He is a mess, crying, his eyes are so red it's obvious he's been crying all night. To make a long story short. He tells me he's realized that he lost his virginity to r word and he thinks what he said was said out of fear. He says no one will believe him because ""men can't be r worded"" etc and that I was his crying out witness. 

I do not know a lot about r word in regards to men. I am very conflicted because he continued to go out with this person for nearly six months after, almost fathered a child with this person and maintained a friendship with this person for decades. I do not want to invalidate him but I am so confused. Because I have felt so manipulated for so long I question if this is a manipulation. But I do not want to misunderstand someone who has legitimately been r worded, I would not be ok with that.

I told him he needed to get help for being r worded and he refused saying he won't talk to someone about this only me that no one will believe a man was r worded. He then asked me to go back to the neighbors and explain that he had been r worded and what he said was out of fear. I said no because they need time to process and I don't want to pester them and I don't want to upset the daughter any further. He said he is never going to leave the house again and went to bed.

Now I am here and completely lost, I know I am not ok with what was said, I know I am super not ok that the daughter heard any of it. I have contacted my therapist but they are on vacation for two weeks. I feel like my spouse is spiraling and I have already said if I feel he is in danger to himself I will call the ambulance without hesitation.

I am sorry for this I just don't know what to do and I have no one I can talk to about this.",1,1738877044.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

I am absolutely exhausted and heartbroken by this whole experience. It's beyond frustrating that, in this day and age, you can’t even reach out to a company without jumping through countless hoops, having to publicly call them out just to get them to do their job.

My base stopped working – covered under warranty, purchased 6 months ago – and I did everything they asked. I sent photos, videos, and followed all the troubleshooting steps. This whole ordeal started on January 6th, and ever since then, I’ve just been waiting. They shipped the replacement part, but it’s been sitting in California, doing nothing. For weeks now, I’ve begged for a replacement. I told them over and over how much I need my kettle, yet all I get is silence or the same, tired responses.

Then, out of nowhere, I get an email from a new employee, telling me I need to wait another week or so. Another week??? As if my frustration hasn’t reached its peak. They don't actually know where the package is, the tracking might as well be made up. And just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, a delivery man shows up – delivering the part. A part for a coffee maker I don’t even own! I have a kettle!

Now I’m stuck emailing them again, only to wait another month. It’s honestly shameful. All I wanted was a replacement so I can have the product I paid for. Is that too much to ask?

Is there a number where I can get a hold of someone? I have been boiling my water on the stove top for a month!

The bean app now has a fully functioning loop. The loop being making your own brewing recipes. Brewing with the recipe. Tasting your cup of coffee. Evaluating your cup of coffee. Recommending changes to brewing recipe according to what you tasted. With the functioning loop, I felt it was enough for an export and upload. So check out this super early not at all finished proto of [the bean app](https://brewinghabits.itch.io/bean-bean-v1) on itch.io! (password = bean)

Uploading to itch.io was easier than I though, however there were some small snags. Font's weren't consistently being recognized and that was fixed through not relying on the default Godot font settings and instead always declaring a font for all the properties. There were some other things like the → symbol that I couldn't get working so I just used -> instead... for now lol.

[The arrow symbol defaulting to the \\""not found\\"" symbols.](https://preview.redd.it/ogunhc6d0lhe1.jpg?width=379&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63b24c5790ba78995fbef2f646fd4e7747c69976)

I made all nodes link dynamically through @ export instead of @ onready. To do this, the fastest way I found was to find the node you want to link, CTRL + click and drag it into your code. Delete the path and swap @ onready to @ export. Then go into the parent node and link the node in the inspector. This will be something I do moving forward because having things break just because a file path is something that I shouldn't be dealing with when a project is being worked on. 



[Dynamic @export nodes that are now in every scene.](https://preview.redd.it/9joxcq140lhe1.jpg?width=1321&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d44797f3646df87a04b9936e34429bdce5062b2)

I also changed many different variables making them more intuitive. So for example, instead of having 4 variables for increments, I combined it to 1 variable and used an array to store the 4 different increments. Lots of small optimizations like this, which has become more clear after developing this far with the app. When I first started the app, I don't think I could easily know why a variable should be a certain format but now that the main loop is built, it is much clear to me that smartly formatted variables will save me headaches down the road by keeping the code nice and tidy.

[Variable bloat comparison with array \(highlighted\) vs individual variables \(everything above\)](https://preview.redd.it/p236t9gk0lhe1.jpg?width=559&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a540068eabfebb4178a447a106db4cb1b846ff7e)

I had this realization with temporary vs saved properties. I have up to this point wanted to always just save every variable and property that I was using and that made sense in my mind. However, I encountered this problem where when I was making a brewing recipe, if I closed the app mid-way, it would still save half of the variables since I was saving them after every scene. It made me realize that I should use the fleeting nature of some variables to my advantage. So in a Singleton, I made some temporary variables that stored the brewing recipe variables (but didn't save them to a file) and only at the end of the brewing recipe making process, would these be saved to a dictionary. This made it so that if the app was closed mid-way, the temporary variables that were saved up to that point would be lost, which was a good thing!

I also have a instance in the code where I make a temporary dictionary from the saved dictionary, which then filters out certain unnecessary variables that I didn't need. This understanding of not saving all data and variables is something I will try to be more aware of and use to my advantage.

[Creating a new dictionary out of specific keys in a bigger dictionary.](https://preview.redd.it/4by78jnrzkhe1.jpg?width=664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee7ccc0f34ecc90aa405800134695ee80ec35800)

Many of the functions that I had made in individual scenes now needed to shift to a Singleton since I was using it in multiple places. So whenever I for example adjusted a brewing variable, that function now resides in a place where all scenes can access it (in the Singleton file) so that I don't need to reinvent the wheel each time I want to change variables. It made sense creating these functions in individual scripts in the beginning when I was trying to figure things out but as I got further into development, I realized that these functions needed to be used in more than one scene. I am considering creating another singleton file. One that stores all the functions and one that stores all the data. This would make it easier to navigate.

A big bang for my buck code was to add transitions between scenes. I coded this simple fade and added it to all of my scene transitions in a few hours. I felt that it gave a much needed polish to the movement of the app. I really want to add more of these refinements down the road but as of right now, there is a lot of functionality that still needs work and that really takes priority over smoothness and aesthetic.

[Simple fade-in transition applied when transitioning scenes.](https://preview.redd.it/hsxohjt9zkhe1.jpg?width=749&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f02b85dbd7415fcc3a10dd3ede61787a8eb1fd22)

One last big thing I did was to code dynamic nodes! Up until last month, I have mostly been placing nodes in the scene and modifying those nodes via code. I knew that I needed to have more dynamic nodes since some elements (like a brewing recipe list) could be 1 recipe or 1000 recipes and that is something that needs to be dynamically done. That was easier said than done, there were some properties that are harder to deal with than others. One example is anchors. The properties you see in the inspector aren't as easy to just use in code because ""this property can only be set in the inspector"" and I needed to dig around and find the way to manipulate said property without knowing what I needed to manipulate. So for the specific Anchor issue, instead of using Bottom Wide anchor, I manually set the anchor points through specific positional values (line 85-88 below)

[Creating nodes for the tweak page dynamically through code.](https://preview.redd.it/ixrw8rbhzkhe1.jpg?width=763&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c168a7a18d3dc1e1b36b32f3211a479910b49067)

If someone knows how to set the Bottom Wide anchor setting through code then lemme know :D

Another thing that I think is important is to make a robust tutorial of sorts because the logic to coffee brewing isn't really intuitive. So for example, to extract less from the bean (which would be to press the - button) means that you increase the grind size. This is because the coarser the grind size, the less surface area is in contact with the water, which leads to less extraction. However just looking at the app interaction, it might seem off pressing a minus button and seeing the grind size go up.

I had a solid catchup with one of my game dev friends who is working in Unreal. It is interesting to see what type of progress he is having (creating an isometric horror'ish game) vs the type of progress I am having. Two very different approaches to the same path that is game dev!

Overall I feel like the bean app is shaping up and I hope to actually finish it off in another 30 day cycle or two. For me to achieve that, I need to look into iOS and Android exports as I would love to have the app on those app stores so that will be something I look into for next time. There is also an edge case of changing two variables in opposite directions that I haven't fully implemented that I want to brainstorm and figure out how I want to function. 

See ya in another 30 days!

TL:DR - Built a version for Itch, converted connections to @ export, used temporary and saved variables with intention, added nodes through code and now focusing on now bringing the app to the common app stores!",4,1738877023.0,godot,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone, I need an outside perspective on this.  

This morning, my (21f) roommate/friend (21f) asked to borrow 30DT because she only had money on her card and needed cash ASAP. I agreed but told her I needed it back before the night ended since I had to pay my rent.  

By 9 PM, my landlord messaged me again, so I texted her asking where she was—no response. At 9:30, I was heading out with my friends and randomly ran into her on the street with her friend. I asked, “Where were you? I was waiting for you.” but didn’t mention the money in front of her friend to avoid embarrassing her. She casually said she was at a coffee shop with her friend.  

I was pissed but didn’t argue then. Later, she texted me saying I overreacted and didn’t like my tone. She explained she had a school project, which is why she was at the café. When I told her that while her school is important to her, paying my rent on time is important to me, she said that her school is a priority but my rent isn’t. I told her that’s not for her to decide and that she could have at least texted me. She claimed her phone died, but I pointed out that all her friends have my number or socials, so she could have easily reached out.  

Now she’s mad and acting like I overreacted. Did I?  

(Sorry if my English isn’t perfect, it’s not my first language.)

Any advice/wisdom/ideas will be appreciated. Obligatory apology for the long post.

32M with soon-to-be zero obligations/debt. 10 years out of college - 5 working as a fed, 1.5 gallivanting around the U.S., last 3.5 working a corporate WFH job I despise. Last 5 years, money has been iffy, 90% due to my own mismanagement/willy-nillyness. Recently reduced costs/spending habits massively (mostly from my current pitstop at my parents' house, a ridiculously fortunate option for me to have). I should be debt free in 4-5 months, barring any unforeseen circumstances.

I'm seeking advice on what to do once my debt is resolved - curious what YOU would do if you were in my insanely flexible situation, as my own ideas haven't been great.

Extra background: Currently single, no kids, basically zero obligations/ties to anywhere, anyone, or anything (I do have a cat, but unless I end up joining a traveling circus, I don't think her existence impacts this - she'll go wherever I go). Job is fully remote/WFH, but TBH, I'd happily turn in my two weeks once my debt hits zero (maybe give it an extra 1-2 months to build up a buffer). The corporate life is miserable. I'd say ""it's not for me"" but idk who this shit is for. Everything feels so fake. I do less work than I ever have, make more money than I've ever made, yet I'm more miserable than I've ever been (I'd rather be back playing in the little pop-up band that performed at amusement parks in 95 degree weather for 25$ a show). I've largely stuck to this type of work as it's what my dad deems successful - former marketing director for large snack company. He thinks he's supportive and ""just wants me to be happy"", but it has to be his way. At this point, I'm over it.

Some things to help narrow: U.S. resident, mostly considering options within U.S. for ease, but I'm open to other recommendations. Lived in every state between Florida and Pennsylvania - currently S.C. Haven't vibed with anywhere I've lived. D.C. was the closest, but it's damn expensive, and my anti-corporate (or really anti-work) vibe isn't the best fit for that city in my experience - especially with dating. Best I've felt in a city was San Diego. Never lived there, but spent extended time vacationing/working-remotely. Also expensive as hell, but where the hell isn't at this point? Recently decided to stop drinking alcohol as it has been nothing but problematic for me (2.5 months dry). I'd like to avoid places that are alcohol-centric, understanding that's a difficult ask in this country, but I know there are places out there (as an example, somewhere like Nashville or Miami would be a no). California sober btw, so I'm okay with the devil's lettuce - attempting to cutback on that too just to avoid constant escapism, but I'm okay with places that have this ingrained in the culture. Hell, might even prefer it. Think it's pretty clear where my politics lie - I'd probably enjoy places that align (who wouldn't?).

Also looking for recommendations on jobs that might be a better fit. Done therapy/career-counseling for years, attempted some careers in the ""arts"", explored grad school options - nothing really stuck. Have a music background, as mentioned above, spent some time exploring that as a career. Had some other hobbies that I explored making a career. The music one made it the furthest, but holy hell does making your hobby your career ruin the damn hobby. At least for me. It took the fun out of it and disconnected me from the reason I liked doing those things in the first place - connecting/collaborating with others. I also don't think life as a performer is fitting for me. Confidence and ego are pretty necessary, even if it's just confidence in your art. I struggle with that.

I'd really like to explore something that directly helps people. 5 years pushing paper as a fed and 3.5 years lining shareholder pockets has felt like the complete opposite of that. Others' firsthand experience has pushed me away from nonprofit work, but I'm open to that. Teaching has always been intriguing to me, and I've enjoyed my time coaching/instructing extracurriculars, but not sure that's a good idea given the current push to abolish the department of ed...

Curious if anyone can recommend jobs/companies/organizations where you feel like you're making a tangible impact, or areas of the country where this type of work or volunteering is abundant. Doesn't necessarily have to be charitable type things, can really be anything. Could be as simple as being the barista that hands you your latte to perk up your day, just anything to see that I'm helping someone feel something positive and I'm not being judged or seen as ""less than"" for having that job.

I've always dreamt of working at a coffee shop, walking to work from my little apartment or little cottage/townhome in a small-to-medium town, and being able to afford said apartment and basic necessities with a job like that. Pipedream?

Last couple things to add: Yes, I lurk r/SameGrassButGreener and have gotten some ideas on places in this country I hadn't considered before. Felt like this post was more fitting here given the added job/lifestyle stuff. If there's another sub that this is more appropriate for, please let me know.

I admit I am not the sharpest tool in the shed. I am distracted each episode because I cannot stop thinking about these things. Some of these are obviously ridiculous and funny but I am so serious. 

1. Who is paying that electric bill? What is powering the generator? 

2. Where do they get their water from and how is it not toxic like the outside? 

3. If the air outside is so toxic that people die within a few minutes, then HOW did they have so many people building this whole thing for that long? 

4. Where do they get their food? Their coffee? Diapers? Medicine? Needles for syringes? Where did the doctors go to med school? Their clothes? Feminine hygiene products?

5. WHERE DID THE CATS COME FROM?

6. The grass outside isn’t tall and looks taken care of. WHO IS MOWING THE LAWN?

7. Where are they getting makeup from? WHO IS DOING THEIR HAIR? How are they getting hair bleach and dye? 

8. Why are there fat people there? THEY HAVE TO WALK EVERYWHERE AND THERE IS NO JUNK FOOD. HOW ARE THEY FAT. 

9. If the outside is actually very green and lush, WHAT ARE THEY CLEANING OFF THE LENS? POLLEN? 

10. Where does their shit and piss go when they flush? Furthermore, WHERE ARE THEY GETTING TOILET PAPER FROM!

11. I already kinda asked this but how do they have access to Lorazepam?! IS THERE A CVS IN THE SILO?

12. Back to the cats, WHERE ARE THEY GETTING CAT FOOD FROM? PETSMART?

13. Where are they getting birth control from and how have they not ran out of it? 

14. Why do they have windows and blinds when they are literally underground? IS IT FOR THE AESTHETIC? 

15. What do they do if someone becomes or is born paralyzed? Do they have wheelchairs? Are there enough wheelchairs? OR DO THEY JUST THROW THEM OUTSIDE?

16. How do they wash their hair? Where is the shampoo coming from? No one’s hair is greasy. WHAT ARE THEY USING?

17. Where are the rest of the bodies outside the Silo? Why do we only see Allison’s & Holsten’s? It’s not like anyone can go out there and retrieve the bodies. I understand bodies decay over time, BUT WHY DON’T WE EVEN SEE THE WHITE SUITS OUT THERE? WHERE DID THEY GO?

18. Where are they getting firearms and ammunition from?

19. How do they know so much about everything else like they literally know how to practice medicine or how to grow crops or how to fix a generator BUT THEY DONT KNOW WHAT STARS ARE? 

20. Why is there a huge body of water completely underground beneath all the levels? How did it get there? ARE THERE FISH?",4,1738876577.0,SiloSeries,32,0.55,False

1ijdkjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1ijdkjy/i_cannot_keep_going_like_this/,I cannot keep going like this,"I am not living a life I’ve been proud of, nor have I been for a long time. 

Early last year I ended an extremely toxic and abusive relationship and, due to being committed to the lease and having this option open for me, moved in with my parents and continued paying for my half of pretty much everything for my ex’s benefit and then going full no-contact. The relationship and break-up themselves have fundamentally fucked me up; what I had was an intense trauma bond with a person I had been with for almost four years who, despite years of abuse both physical and verbal/mental, distancing from my family, and a derailing of the life that I was trying to build for myself, I missed for a very long time and am realizing I still do (I wouldn’t still be so angry over what happened otherwise). 

I left a dead-end office job at the same time and took a cut in my pay to work a slightly better retail environment to save money and focus on moving abroad with the goal of teaching English to non-speakers (I got a certification to do so last summer and found a program, but it doesn’t start for another like 6 months). My parents have been supportive of my plan and have opened their door to me until I can get going to Spain to have some amazing experiences and build some invaluable experience for my future. 

It sounds like a good plan. And I’m utterly fucking miserable. 

I’m 24 and, having lived on my own or with my partner for like 5 years, I’m living with my parents and eating the food off their table again. I’m working a job that is getting me nowhere fast and isn’t without problems. I’m in a part of the country that I hate, with nothing to do and no new people to meet. And I feel so alone. I realized after my breakup that I have my family (sans my sister who lives in Chicago) and that is it. I either grew apart from or was so distanced from my old friends that they’re just gone now and I didn’t even realize until my relationship ended and the whole fucking world fell out from under me. Meanwhile I live in southeast Michigan where everything is a 30 minute drive away and everyone in their early to mid 20s either has their friends and isn’t trying to make more or they’ve moved to Chicago or New York or some shit. The worst part is that my only plan is moving abroad because I don’t have any decent education or marketable experience in the job market. I got my degrees in history and English and the LEAST that anywhere relevant and decently paying (lol) needs is a master’s degree. And I don’t really even want to do anything anymore. I wanted to write fiction for a living but I feel too depressed or otherwise busy to make the time and when I do I genuinely don’t even feel like I’m good at writing anymore. I don’t see a point to it. So I sink all my free time into reading as much as I can, watching movies, consuming the art and media that I need to find something, ANYTHING. And it’s all just a fucking waste of time. So, I try going out. I drive way too far, drink way too little at a bar, alone, get too overwhelmed with anxiety to insert myself upon a group or person who’s there, and I leave. 

I miss having a partner but I don’t think I have the room in my life or my being for a relationship anymore. Even with this, I’ve had people say “oh just date for fun! You’re allowed to go out and meet people and not have it be anything!” so I try. I’ve gone out and had drinks with a few people, caught movies or grabbed coffee with others. Made out with a few, and I have an on again off again sexual relationship with a girl who works in the same building as me. All nice people. All feel like they care about my wellbeing. I have fun with all of them and I don’t have to worry in the moment. 

And I feel so utterly empty. Just, hollow. 

Like, is this what life is? Just a black cloud over everything? Nothing ever feels like the real thing, I just feel like I’m imitating an attempt at a fulfilling life but everyone can see the act that I’m putting on and how miserable I am underneath it. Meanwhile, it’ll be a year since the breakup soon and my ex seems like she’s doing great, talking about how 2024 was such a spectacular year for her and she’ll cherish even the “bad” memories (quote marks included). So I’m stuck grappling with two possibilities. Either I’m the narcissist who pushed her to act how she did and I’m the villain of the story - something that has plagued my anxiety and filled me with doubts since I left - and it was all just reactive abuse from her…but pretty much anyone that I explain these feelings and the circumstances to, in as neutral of a way as possible so that I can try to avoid bias, has given me the same “holy shit, that’s horrible, thank god you got out of that situation”. So the other possibility is that she fucked up my mind and my body and used me as a doormat while I gave every last minute, dollar, and shred of sanity to worship her and give her the life she wanted because I loved her and she was utterly miserable and nasty if she got anything less, and she gets to move on guilt free with all of her friends propping her up and telling her she’s the good guy while I turn into an anxious, depressed, hollowed out shell of who I was before the relationship. I figured a year would be enough time for me to crash out, lose my mind, and then rebuild myself into someone I could be proud of, but the truth is that beyond the good grooming, hygiene, fashion, and physical appearance that I force myself to put on because of how badly I embarrass myself with the way that I feel, I’m a fucking disaster. I got a bunch of tattoos that I get complements on and beat my ass in the gym because it’s easier to explain than SH, but I have migraines, stomach ulcers, night terrors, insomnia, and I spend any day where I’m not scraping by with the bare minimum at work in a catatonic haze, reading or trying to write or doomscrolling or just doing nothing. None of the performative bullshit makes me feel good - makes me feel anything - and I’m wondering if faking it til I make it will ever actually do anything or if I’ll just always be a wretch that can put on a two-dimensional flimsy facade of confidence and a pleasant aura when I step outside than any semi-aware person will see right through. 

I want to make the change. I want to get up and move, even when I’m frozen in depression for 90% of the time. I want to get more education. I want a better job. I want to be enigmatic and sociable, the kind of presence that is missed when gone and cherish when around. I want to feel likable. I want to live somewhere that makes me happy and where I can meet other likeminded people. I want friends and to not feel so lonely all the time. I want an apology from my ex. I want an apology from my old friends who turned me away when I needed them.

And yet, I have a few thousand to my name in the worst economy possible. I live at home. I have no means of educating. I have no marketable experience outside of the world of coffee shops. I have no realistic ambitions or means of achieving them. Rent is through the roof. I’m wracked with social anxiety. I have no friends. I have meaningless sexually tense liaisons with strangers that will lead me nowhere. I don’t know where I want to live or what I want to do with my life. I have the teaching certification, yes, but no actual means of making good money unless I move abroad, and the soonest I can do that is the beginning of the 2025/2026 school year, by which time yet another year will have dissolved away from me, and I’ll be making table scraps doing it somewhere else but possibly be even more lonely and miserable, just in a foreign country. Then I’ll know for a fact that no matter how far I run or how hard I try to start over as a new person in a place where no one knows me, I’ll never run away from myself or the cloud that hangs over me. 

Part of me wants to live fully and ambitiously and excitingly and successfully just to spite my ex and all of the “happier than ever” shit that she subtweets to me online, but I want to have a will to live beyond someone I want nothing to do with anymore. And I don’t have it. 

I’m ready to do something drastic. Whether it’s quit my job, or take an unannounced road trip, or pack up and move to a new city with no plan and just make it work, or apply to some bullshit masters program, or to do something far far more drastic, I need a change. The monotony, the sense that I’m just throwing away this life, the sense that every single person who has ever hated me is winning over me, the sense of being destined to being repulsive and unlikable forever, no matter how hard I try to be palatable to others, getting passed by my peers and siblings, the perpetual unhappiness, the anger, the loss of all direction, the loss of any hope in the world we live in. I cannot live this way anymore. Something has to change. Something has to happen. And I’m running out of strength to do all but a few things. ",2,1738876291.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False
1ijdjb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ijdjb4/what_would_you_do/,What would you do?,"Dear Reddit readers,

this is my first time posting here but I sometimes read through different topics here and on Quora where I will post as well in search for an answer. I kindly ask for a bit of your time to read through my post and answer what would you do if you were me, I am in the middle of a life threating situation for too long now. I apologize for the long post.I am a 35 yo woman. I grew up in an abusive household where I was treated badly by my biological family in 4 walls and well only when public audience was there. Alcoholic father, mother that never spoke to me when we were alone, called me on my phone or only insulted me, raised by my grandfather that lived in the same house and took me to library, parks, lakes, dancing classes, did all the stuff that mothers usually do. He died when I was 16. My 5 year older sister was tought to treat me like trash since young age. I always found family in friends and coped with it in that way. I was the best kid in the class in elementary school without any help from my folks. I was constantly threatened by police or psy ward for no reason. At the age of 14 I was taken away from home by social services bcs my father was beating me up and bcs of abuse.  They told people I was where bad kids are instead of the ones that have no home. At the age of 13 I had a suicide atempt by drinking all the pills I found and experienced clinical death which was ignored by my mother. After 6 month I was returned back into the hell house with an explaination that my family has money. In highschool I was the worst one in class by grades. I wasn’t given money for basics like a sandwich, even went to do sex for money 3 times at the age of 15 to buy shirts for school. My sister on the other hand was a golden child that wore branded clothes. I cooked my own food and did my own laundry since elementary school. At the age of 16 and 17 I worked at a car wash and paid for my summer sea vacations. I come from the capital of Croatia. During growing up I was often taken to Bosnia where my mother comes from to spend summers and vacations at my wider family householdes by myself until that became forbidden. I’ve been kicked out of the house all the time for no reason and often had to sleep where I found an opportunity to sleep, doing sex out of gratitude. They’ve been paying people to harm me since I was a teenager. My online activity was monitored and they would send men on me online that would urinate on me and do sick SM stuff which I was not aware of at the time. I was constantly called incapable, to enter university for example or to drive a car while my sister was given a car and a lisence at the age of 18. I managed to enter 2 universities and chose 2 foreign languages studies. They were pretending to be a social case all my life eventhough rich, complaining how my studies are putting them in heavy minus. I got pregnant by one paid man that performed heavy SM on me against my will which I found out during my summer scholarship in Izmir, Turkey which I got by being a good student. I opted for abortion having no support from anyone which beat me up. It crushed me and I felt like a killer, prayed to lord to forgive me on daily bases. At the age of 19 I met my ex boyfriend that was also paid by my biological family to beat me up, abuse me, take away my documents and money etc. I moved in with him and his family at the age of 19 when I left the hell house. At the age of 21 he got me pregnant against my will, said that the child is not his close to 2 months of pregnancy, my mother cursed me only when I told her and I got money from someone to terminate pregnancy again not wanting to bring a child into the world that would get beaten like me etc. I got rid of that boyfriend and went to work as a roomaid for the summer season to a 5 star hotel at the seaside to leave the horror behind me. There I met “Olga” that is important for later, a single mom.  I got back to the family house with a reccommendation letter on the table but was again kicked on the streets with violence for no reason. I had enough money for 2 months rent, met one ex boyfriend that offered housing. After this bad relashionship that involved fists in my head I went to work on a 7 star cruise ship as a room made. I got badly bullied by a woman that bullied all the room maids and even hurt one womans leg with a troley. There I met “Rea”, portugeese “friend”. I got off the ship with her after 3 months and went to see a private psychiatrist with my mother. She asked my mother why she doesn’t have a relashionsip with me and got an answer “just because”. The doctor sent her outside of the room and told me she cannot put me on pills or to psych ward bcs I am normal but recommended a womans safe house in Bosnia to get the hell away from my bio family. I walked barefoot to the holy hill to ask virgin Mary to forgive me for abortions. I went there and felt better but after a month my parents came there, convinced the people in charge that I am a drug addict that needs to be sent to rehab. I politely refused and found my first office job in Romania at the age of 24 realizing it is not possible to finish university having nothing to eat during 12-hour schedule and without a home quiet often. There I gained self confidence for the first time in my life but quit after 7 months due to one high positioned man threatening me that he will destroy me in the company if I won’t be with him. I went back to hell house but started to realize at that point that my parents are psychopats and that my father is looking at me in a way you don't look at your daughter. I found another corpo job in Romania and worked there when 25 and 26 for 14 hours unpaid overtime daily, had the best results like wherever I worked. I was not allowed to come ""home"" for vacations for no reason and spent them in London, Stockholm, Split, Porto. One time my father picked me up from the airport saying I can enter family house only to have a cup of coffee and that is when I told him my bosses name and surname. Upon comeback to the office she started calling me not normal on one to one meetings. At that time I was meeting paid dominant men both in person and online which was sick. One time when my family let me stay in hell house for a vacation at 25 only bcs company people drove me home (for the image). I went out with my girl friends and came home at 4AM, my mother hit me with her fists and called me a hooker and a prostitute foor that. At the age of 27 I traveled to Amsterdam from Romania to meet portugeese ""Rea"" from the cruise ship that changed plans to stay in the same accommodation in the last minute. After a night out with her I ended up sleeping on the bus home at night which never happened to me before. After exiting the bus on the wrong stop I got raped. I went back to Romania and continued working but couldn't deal with mobbing and rape got to me so I decided to quit. I was invited to go to Ireland by one coisine but my father told me that this cousin is a drug addict and an alcoholic, that I should suddenly come back to the hell house. I said that I would come only for a month until I find a new job but only if he doesn't hit me and scream at me. He said ok but when I got back one day he hit my head in the wall and grabbed my neck with his hand saying I must immediately sit in a car with him to go to a mental institution. I asked for a reason, an argument, he said there is none, it is bcs he says so.  He said it is that or the streets. I chose the streets, went to sleep to a man I met online then gotten a corpo job in Poland. There I stayed only for a month, until I found an ad online for club dancing in Switzerland. I decided to go and make money for a home that way but when I came there that was no dancing, if you understand. I stayed for 10 days, gotten back to my town by one friends suggestion, got an offer from one of top IT companies in my city but refused due to having no home there, went to work to Makarska as  a camp receptionist because there I had a trailer home included. Suddenly I got an office corpo job offer from Lille, France where I got a decent salary. I broke my arm there, my father wrote an email that he is dying, undergoing a surgery, that his last wish is for me to go to a mental institution. I set on the bus, gotten back to home town to see him thinking it is normal to go to see your father before he dies, no matter the bad stuff. When I came he said that he isn't dying, that it is only a minor surgery, started saying I have shitzofrenia and that he will not have peace until I am proclaimed a incapable, kicked me on the streets again. All this time my sister is doing nothing in life living in the hell house fully financed by my bio parents. I went back to Lille but my godmother made me pack my stuff saying she will offer me housing back in home town. When  I came with 40 kilo wardrobe she said that she cannot take me in bcs my father explained to her that I am a drug addict. I was not using drugs, only a joint sometimes. My mother hugged and kissed me for the first time in my life forcing me to go to psy ward with her so I went. There she told the doctor that I am banging my head against the walls (!). She was not believed by the doc so I did not stay there. I met 2 childhood friends and told them that my family is trying to lock me up in a psy ward and has convinced me that I am incapable, that I need support to go for a job interview. They knew nothing about everything written because I kept quiet all my life. They tought that bcs my parents say so it is like that (coming from loving families) so they tricked me and took me to psy ward where I did say I have suicidal thoughts bcs of my life situation and was kept there therefor. I was given emotional personality disorder with suicidal thoughts. I was poly drugged by 9 pills per day, gained 15 kilo, lost my cognitive skills, imagination, became a plant. I exited the hospital and went back to the club in Switzerland having nowhere to go (in my country even people over thirty mostly still live with their parents, as did my friends). My ex boss and a colleague from Romania sent a flight ticket to go back to work where I previously worked at the age of 24. Getting off all the meds cold turkey I lost my mind and became suicidal, attempted to kill myself. Ended up in state psy ward there, gotten out thanks to my boss and his then wife, continued working but was still not ok, the company paid for a private clinic that diagnosed depression. I had to relearn how to walk and talk.  I told them to sedate me with whatever they want but that I want my life and mind back without drugs. I weened of 8 type of pills in 8 months and started microdosing magic mushrooms. Gotten better, started walking 10km per day and working both in the office and helping my then girl friend with her job , kids, pets etc. I spent 5 beautiful years in Romania and saved 22 thousand euros wanting to buy a flat. The company gave me a psychologist that discovered to me that I have CPTSD and that I am wrongly diagnosed in my country. Once I went to my hometown to make new docs and stayed with that ex boyfiend that made me pregnant in early twenties. When visiting from Romania over the years he would say that he is not ok with my father, then that he is ""so so"" ok with him and then that they re super ok, he is a hacker. We were intimate, when I told him that I realize that he is video taping intercourse he called me crazy . It ended up with fists in my head for no reason and kicking me out on the streets. I realized by then that he was paid by my family t o do this. After I came back to Romania and refused him he put our intercourse photos all over fake profiles on social network. He said he has other camera material of me and that he hacked my webcam modelling videos, I did it for 3 months to help ""Sam"" with the rent. Back in Romania there was ""Sam"" from Slovenia living with me, we started on the same day in the company. He claimed that he is a virgin which made me comfortable living with him in roomateship first until we went official. We never had sex. He got me into crypto investing and made me believe that Revolut does not work for me, that I should use his for investing. I had 20 thousand on his account at the time. The bank said they would give me a loan to buy a home. A man appeared in the company claiming to be a big financial expert and crawled into my life. I felt sorry for him bcs nobody would be his friend. Lets call him Sean. I sensed from the second time I saw him that he was sent to Romania by my biological family to destroy me and told Sam about it. Sam gave me silent treatments, broke my arm so I couldn't work for 2 months, smashed the car I bought etc. At one point he brought his cray cray friend ""Maja"" to work with us, I fixed her a flat next to ours, she would spend 9h per day at my place not letting me sleep. I was financing her and Sam. I had a feeling that my phone is being followed. Sam then brought in his brother. 3 of us and his brothers dog lived in a 45 square meter flat, he smashed all the flat  getting drunk. I started to realize that Sam was also maybe sent to Romania by my bio family to destroy me. Psichologist warned me about Sean and Sam. I paid for another bigger flat for him, his bro and me to move in there but got attacked by his brother and thrown on the streets. Ended up at Seans place. Sean tried to take away my docs, made me rent a fake flat that turned out to be outside of civilisation, I was threatened by big bold guy, lost 2000e for the story. Eventually I couldn''t hold a work from home job no more having no home. I decided to go to Croatia where a man I knew from the business world was asking me to come to Split, Croatia to work there for him, he made it , became a millioner etc. I gave his name and surname to my father in the past. I relocated, paid for rent for 5 months cutting my long hair short for a fake job and being sexually used in the end for it. My chihahua got attacked by a random man on the streets after I got a message from an unknown person that he can see me through the cam and after I wrote to someone I am going out with a dog to the bakery, 500e for leg surgery.  When traveling there Sam hit me with his fists on Romanian Hungarian border and left me there on -20. Sean came and drove until Split. After finally realising the job will not happen I relocated to Sofia for a new work from home tech job. There I received a text in perfect Croatian from Sean that only used Slovenian with me (I speak 4 languages) saying that it is not over bcs I relocated, that I will still get locked up. They sent men under my  window to make gestures with their tongue and a man that wore a mask to look like my grandfather. I spoke to my psychologist that diagnosed CPTSD and she got me a safe place to live under the cameras in Romania, it is where women that have been through human trafficking or a lot in life live. I left the new job and relocated back there but when I reached safety they have cut my money, suddenly I couldn't access the money on my account. I knew they will try to lock me up so I've gotten 12000eur form credit house in Romania before leaving last time. Out od 32000e in crypto of my money on Sam's account I only got 5000e back. I ended up in Bucharest where an ex colleague paid for my hotel. I told someone that my battery is out over the phone, a man knocked on my door giving me a charger without a word (!). Later he picked it up. In front of the hotel there was Rea from Portugal suddenly passing by in DKNY shirt (she comes from a poor family) starring at me, that is when I knew the rape in Amsterdam was set up as well. She had nothing to do in Bucharest and was never there. When I went for a smoke outside men from balconies nextdoor would go too. My psychologist called me and told me they have entered her phone too, send me her WA screenshots which show her WA is being installed on other devices, had a panic attack on cam being worried about her own life, clients and clinic. She said she needs to cut contact therefor. On the bus towards hometown a man beat me with his fist, other man touched me, the only woman inside told me that she is on the bus because of me but that it doesn't matter, that I should join her to go to the river at 3 AM which I didn't do. In my hometown I tried going to the police but police did not believe me, I couldn't explain everything this well being scared. Sean dragged me to Slovenia lying we will be roomates. Sam came from Romania to pick me up but ended hitting me with his fists in my head and throwing me out on the streets. Roomateship was a lie. To cut it shorter I ended up in a psy ward in Slovenia in Sean's company after trying to make a police report, police said they don't care what happened in other countries. I was not believed about my phone being fallowed and got psychosis diagnosed therefor, spent 2 months there. I called my father and told him they made it, that I am locked up. My mother was dragging people from my country there pretending to be a worried mother. She told the doctor that she is scared of me so I got transported back to my country in an ambulance veachle. The doctor in hometown hospital did not understand the diagnosis since I seemed normal to her. After release my bio family took Sam and me in only bcs people now knew. I married Sam thinking it would protect me legally and opted for his abuse rather then my family's. I paid for our honeymoon. We got back to Romania for 4 months, I took another chihahua and gotten a 6 months job offer from top IT company in the world with relocation package included. I relocated by myself to Ireland therefor. There I lived in a penthouse as I called it and gotten back to normal without pharma drugs, bought clothes that were left behind in horror stories, met new people and gained valuble friendships like everywhere I lived. After the job ended I got another corpo job but struggled with getting accomodation. Sam came to Ireland and made me write the car I bought to his name. I contacted Revolut that confirmed that my devices have been hacked and account broken into, that I should contact Europol cybercrime which I never did being busy.  I received a job offer from ex employer in Romania, relocated, Sam came to bring back the dogs. He made me rent a particular apartment that smelled of insect sprays that he was using to extreme, full of insects, abusive landowner that gave me 2 different contracts with different addresses on them. They set up my new bos that started on the same day to do heavy mobbing on me. Internet and TV I paid for were not working. I took medical leave and visited the company to ask for their relastate agent. They called ambulance on me which said that I am ok and don't need to go to anykind of hospital. Police was called on my request to report illegal housing. They took me to another room, spoke to the policeman, Sam was there in my absence suddenly. When I came the policeman grabbed me and took me to psy ward. The doctor never spoke to me, only to the policeman and I spent 13 days there being sedated with pharma drugs. Sam dissapeared to his country during my stay there. Later he came back. Electricity in attick flat started to go on and off. He said he is leaving to his country to switch cars. By then I was fully convinced that Sam is a paid person to harm me. He insisted we travel by night even though I like to sleep at night. I went to the police to report that I will travel with him and that I am scared for my own life. After we crossed Hungarian Slovenian border Sam put a scarf over his nose and mouth and reliesed chemicals smell that came out of car ventilation and suffocated us all, including 2 dogs that I was holding on the window not to die. When we reached his family house it was fully smelling of chemicals/gas and suffocated us all. He was claiming that nothing is happening, that I am paranoid. He accepted to take me to the bus stop towards home city only when I told him that I will go to knock on neighbour doors to call the police (my phone was not working ofc). On the station there was a sea of police following us. When I reached Zagreb an ex colleague from Romanian job that offered housing went with me to crime police bcs I did not believe him about the housing and reporting me to his address. He lied infront of crime policeman that he will report me to his address but instead his car suddenly broke down in a middle of a busy street. I parted ways with him and had issues getting a cab to go to ""Lila"". ""Lila"" is the next door neighbour of my family house that they forced into my company during the first lockdown after being friends with her for 25 years. For years she pretended to be my supporter and against my family, gave me a place to stay once or twice. I called 112 and police told me to wait for them in a coffee shop where I ordered two coffees but got thrown out for no reason by a bribed waiter. Waiting for the bus I saw my countries army car came to the coffee shop from the distance in the end but was too late to catch them (busy street with loads of crossroads). I reached Lila's place and she was suddenly unfriendly. I called the cops and told them that I am in a safe place now, so I tought. Police transfered me to regular police not taking me seriously no more bcs I was not at the coffee place when they came I believe. After the phonecall Lila started being abusive, screamed at me, started saying that she is now ok with my bio family and that I should go to a psy ward. In time she released chemical/gas smell into the sleeping room and the rest of her house, ordered me to sleep there, both me, her and her 2 cats were suffocating. I got out of her house to catch some air and heard her saying to someone on the phone ""she noticed"" (the smell) and ""yes, she is scared"". I walked in the middle of tram tracks in the busy street being scared, spent the nigh on a busy road and went to the crime police in the morning. They didn't want to receive me but got me to an ambulance veachle. The man on the back with me released chemical smell which caused us both to suffocate. On psy ward check in it was the same smell and a fake doctor that was later a patient inside with me that got me to a bad ward with shizofrenics inside. When I reached real doctors all I could say was that I was suffocated with chemicals. I got forced stay of 1 month and gotten shitzoaffective disorder diagnosed. I then let my bio family know that they have suceeded, if I could now get back ""home"". They came to the hospital and treated me like a peace of s.it) abusing me and saying they won't let me enter the hell house. My finances were drained. I booked a plain to go back to Romania where I found out that my contract will not be prolonged bcs of long absence and bcs the papers came from Croatian and not Romanian doctor. I moved into a new rented flat where remote owner was fake, chemicals smell everywhere, washing machne did not work. Fake owner sent fake plumbers to fix the machine, they never fixed it. After complaining about it to the owner the answer was I need to move out. I took a cab to get to Flixbus to go back to my home town hospital bcs of having nowhere to go. In the cab the driver directed where exactly to sit and released chemicals/gas on me, I was left without smell and taste. Remember ""Olga"", a single mom ex co-worker? She came looking for me to the hospital but never found me. She managed to get my fathers number after we had no contact for 11 years to try to reach me and find out where I am. He told her that giving out my personal info is not ok after she told him she can accomodate me in Germany :) I opened my social media after 3 years and found her message. She came from Germany with a small kid by train to get me. My mother came to the hospital few times bringing people with her and playing to be a mother. She threatened me that something bad will happen to me in Germany + I was sedated under pills so I got scared after everything that happened. She pushed social services to place me where people that are nt able to take care of themselves live. I've been living out of civilization in corn for aprox 3 months now I believe. I now live with 4 women, one talks to herselfe and laughs, one is 74, one is 64 and pooped everywhere when she came, one is in her 50s all sedated. They all take a lot of pills. I don't take my 3 pills in secret and therefor feel better then in a hospital. My mental clarity and cognitive skills are back. Still, it is very hard to endure living here missing my independence. I am still not proclaimed as incapable on paper and hold a working capacity. Social worker said I can leave whenever I want just to let a woman in charge know. I have let both the woman in charge and social services know that I wish to leave but there is no green light from their side as of yet. The woman in charge insists I see a psychiatrist before I leave bcs of some inspection which is traumatic, going back to the hospital and having to lie about drinking pills. I wish to go to Olga, her friend would come by car to get me, travel with me by train to Germany and I would live with Olga and her 3 kids. Idea is to find a work from home job and not to leave the apartment much without her. I am very scared bcs I believe they already have a plan on how to destroy me again in Germany (being in my phone). I miss freedom, civilization, normal people, working, I am a workaholic. It is very risky to go but also tricky to stay where I am, I cannot endure living here til the rest of my life. I would travel to Germany with 120e in my pocket and need to start from 0 like every time they destroy me with a little help from my friend. What would you do? My biological parents are psychopats. Thank you for reading and God bless you.

1ijdh27,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1ijdh27/if_an_ex_wants_to_be_friends_can_i_absolve_myself/,"If an ex wants to be friends, can I absolve myself of guilt?","Broke up with my most recent ex almost a year ago. It was a terrible breakup, we were already having problems and arguing for months. I definitely didn't handle it well; instead of doing the respectful thing and calling her over to end it, I kept mulling over the decision and tried to rationalize different options, do a pros and cons list, etc. for weeks. One day we were hanging out while things were still bad and she said ""I'm confident we can work this out"" and I just blurted ""I envy your confidence but I am not."" She was clearly hurt, and I thought I shouldn't drag this out any longer even though I still felt undecided, and told her I want to break up. It was like an hour or two breakup, and my thoughts and reasoning were super stream-of-consciousness and jumbled. For a long time after I felt super guilty for how I handled it, how my decision was kinda pulled out of me, and how I couldn't even be coherent and clear with her. 

Her and I met up two months later because she felt she didn't have closure and we talked it through much more calmly. We both apologized for stuff, I knew at the time she wanted to get back together. I told her I had no intention of that. We have mutual friends so I said I want to be cordial and I'll say hi in group settings but that's pretty much the extent of us ""being friends."" Seemed like she understood at the time.

Since then, she's reached out to try to initiate conversation, or when we run into each other at group events she's asked if I want to get coffee and says she still cares about me. I keep saying no, I can't do anything 1:1. She's my ex, I still feel weird around her even in group settings and I try to limit my interaction with her as much as possible. Idk if she is still into me, she has a new boyfriend.

I sometimes still feel guilty for how I handled the breakup. But if the person I feel guilty for treating poorly still wants to be friends, can I absolve myself of that guilt? I have no intention of being friends with her more than acquaintances, so I'm kind of just looking for validation here, or for people to tell me I'm right for feeling guilty.",1,1738876065.0,internetparents,9,0.67,False

1ijdgdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1ijdgdk/rexs_empowering_power_practice_february_6th/,Rex’s Empowering(?) Power Practice - February 6th,"Rex was having trouble thinking of what lesson he would be doing. Manipulation? No, children of emotion-based gods would be better at such a lesson. A lesson on swords? Also no; he didn’t have enough experience with his own katana.



Powers? Now that sounded interesting. Sure, he did not have his own powers fully realized, but he knew enough about them to formulate a lesson on general usage of powers.



So, he went to the arena, and put together some things for a lesson; namely, he got a few dummies out for the more combat-based powers campers would have. He also got a chalkboard from… somewhere.



—



As everyone who would attend the lesson gathered in the arena, Rex pointed to the chalkboard, which read *DEVISING WAYS TO EFFECTIVELY USE YOUR POWERS AND TO LEARN UNKNOWN ONES*. For once, he wasn’t wearing anything too fancy, just a black shirt and pants alongside a red scarf.



He cleared his throat. “I am Rex Diamandis, son of Eunomia and counsellor of the Horai cabin. Today, I am continuing to serve my purpose as a counselor; this time, I will be holding a lesson, one about the powers us demi-gods have.”



Rex cleared the chalkboard, writing and drawing on it as he spoke. “First, one power can be wildly different from another, even if it is inherited from the same godly parent. For instance, I have an ability capable of weakening a random aspect in an opponent (OOC: Debuff Inducement), yet I also have an ability that simply allows me to heat something up, but only to a certain temperature (OOC: Pasteurizing Grasp).”



He finished drawing, the chalkboard now showing something on two different sides. One showed 2 stick figures in a battle, with one looking visibly weaker than the other due to the use of a debuff. The second side showed a stick figure with what seemed to be a bucket of milk, looking at it with a question mark above its head. Rex didn't seem to be a great artist, but the chalkboard drawings worked well enough. He continued. “This is to say that not every power is meant for battle. In fact, some can be quite mundane, or even seem useless. However, that mundanity gives room for creativity. For instance, the second power I mentioned is normally used to pasteurize things such as milk. However, I have found that it is quite useful for heating up hot drinks, such as coffee or hot chocolate.”



Rex grabbed a hot chocolate mug hidden on a stool behind the chalkboard. He held it for a little bit before actually drinking it. He then placed it back, continuing. “My recommendation is to find more casual and unusual uses for powers. The only way to make your godly parents’ gifts useful is to make them your own. The more you grow accustomed to them, the better you will be at using them as if they were second nature.”



He then turned, clearing the chalkboard again as he began writing/drawing something else. “Now, for the next part of the lesson, let’s talk about the unknown powers we may have. Obviously, our powers develop over time, and different aspects of them don’t become clear until later on. Excluding some of the more experienced demigods around here and other special cases, we do not have full knowledge of our abilities. My advice? Be patient and work towards discovering those powers. Perhaps specific triggers can activate them, or maybe watching a fellow camper can cause them to emerge.”



His drawing on the chalkboard was of a stickman watching another stickman doing something with a lightning bolt; perhaps he was just using Zeus' children as basic examples. In a second panel, the first stickman seemed to spontaneously learn how to do the same, albeit with a thinner lightning bolt. It was obviously exaggerated, but painted a picture of what Rex was saying.



He then turned back. “To end this lesson, I recommend you all work with cabin mates to try and come up with new ideas on using your powers, as well as trying to make unknown ones emerge. If not cabin mates, then work with those whose godly parents share similar domains with yours. Just please do not use powers on your fellow campers improperly; I have no interest in being blamed for harm of bodies, minds, or relationships. Oh, and, of course, remember your limits. Our powers can prove to be a bit much for our bodies. We may be the children of gods, but we are very much mortal.”



*For now,* Rex added in his head. He then nodded. “Dismissed. You all may do what you wish now. I intend to execute a follow-up lesson in the future. If you need anything from me, walk up to me and i may answer. Give everything your all.”



He then went to his fellow Horai cabin mates, doing just as he recommended for the lesson.",2,1738876019.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

# Truth Bullets

[Nanami File](#bullet) The victim is Byakuya Togami. Probably. Byakuya should have died at, maybe…10:35PM…ish? I think?

[DICE Directive #1 - The Friend Ship](#bullet) What ship never sinks? That’s right! The Friend Ship! Unfortunately, Hope’s Peak isn’t friendship, it’s a building, and it’s filling up with water with every passing moment. In an undetermined amount of time the entire school will be submerged. Unless…

[Adaptation is Key](#bullet) As the first floor was submerged, the astute staff working hard at DICE realized certain necessary faculties were no longer accessible. The fifth floor biology lab was converted into a room with a kitchen area and a dining area. Showers and additional sinks have been added to each communal bathroom on their respective floors. The Physics Lab on the fourth floor was turned into a theater room. Lastly, all classrooms are equipped with a basic lock that can only be locked from the inside.

[Byakuya's Adapted Library](#bullet) The library showed clear signs of Byakuya modifying to his personal preferences, with furniture shifted and personal items scattered. Some include the many books stacked on the table, a corner to write with a notebook and pens, another to sit and listen to vinyl records, and another for snacking and drinking. One particular modification is that there was originally a small glass vase on the front counter, but now only shattered pieces remain.   

[The Archives](#bullet) Byakuya repurposed the Archives, a room inside the Library, to become his sleeping quarters. The walls are lined up with shelves almost fully packed with volumes to long encyclopedias, each row being a different edition. Seemingly, the last book on one of the rows is missing. There is a sleeping bag on the floor and a small coffee table. The door to the Archives can be locked from the inside and showed no signs of tampering. 

[Uneven Coffee Table](#bullet) The coffee table inside the Archives had one of the four legs broken, needing about three inches to balance. Byakuya placed the twenty-first volume of The DICE-Revised Universal Compendium of All Knowledge™️ under the leg to fix this problem.

[Slumber Party Massacre](#bullet) Rooms are less plentiful as the school fills with water ~ so people had to get creative with sleeping arrangements. The following people have confirmed their location of rest (courtesy sleeping bags and pillows provided by DICE): 

Byakuya - Archives

Ibuki + Himiko - Classroom 2A

Mondo + Chihiro - Classroom 2B

Komaru + Mikan - Classroom 3A

Yasuhiro + Gundham - Classroom 3B

Mukuro - Classroom 4A

Kaede + Maki + Kaito - Classroom 4B

Kirumi + Angie - Classroom 5A

Korekiyo - Classroom 5B

Fuyuhiko - Classroom 5C

[Idle Hands are the Devil’s Workshop](#bullet) At 8:00 AM this morning DICE sent a personalized message to every student. It indicated that their orientation period has finished and they are now to begin the training program in earnest. Each student was given a list of tasks unique to them that must be completed before midnight unless they were tired of that whole “living” thing.

[Isolation](#bullet) Upon finding out they were being ~~forced~~ invited into a DICE Killing Game, most of the class used this as a chance to unify. Byakuya was not one of those people. Shortly after the situation was apparent to all, Byakuya claimed the library for himself and would only occasionally leave for minimum periods of time for necessities such as going to the bathroom. 

[Body Discovery](#bullet) Shortly after 11 PM a loud noise sounding like glass shattering was heard coming from the library. Ibuki, Himiko, Chihiro, and Mondo followed the noise and found the library unlocked. They found Byakuya’s corpse after walking into the library and noticing the scent of blood from the Archives room. Upon seeing the corpse the body discovery announcement rang out (11:20 PM) and the remaining class members arrived shortly after. 

[Stuck Books](#bullet) Gundham attempted to move some of the books on a shelf of the Archives and was unable to dislodge any book in the row whatsoever.

[Glass Pieces](#bullet) Fuyuhiko tried to gather the scattered glass shards. He used a book to transport the pieces but quickly abandoned the idea when the jagged edges began slicing into the book’s cover with minimal pressure.

[Knife Holder](#bullet) The kitchen knives are stored in a stand affixed to the countertop, but one of the knives is missing. The object is coated with water on the outside.

We finally ended it a week ago, and while we were both sad, I think I was more into the idea of things working out than he was. We live together, and though I have been looking for a place to go, I haven't found a good place yet, and so we remain on the lease together. It's been calm and friendly.

Today is my birthday. I have never been a fan of my birthday so I generally don't make a thing of it. He bought me a large $200 coffee maker on Amazon and a lot of coffee. He knows I love coffee and have been using a $25 drip thing since my last one broke.

It's extremely kind and thoughtful, but I feel so wrong receiving it. We will likely not live together when his birthday comes around (April), I feel slightly indebted and finances have always been disproportional (with him making way more money).

I know the gesture comes from a place of kindness but I just feel so torn receiving it. It's a gift you get a boyfriend, not an ex.

I know bringing it up will likely cause an argument or at least damper the friendly mood. I just feel so weird opening such a nice thing that I don't feel like I should have been given.

But what was Lorenz—who is now remembered as the founder of the branch of mathematics called chaos theory—really getting at?","Our story begins in the 1960s, when Lorenz was trying to use early computers to predict the weather. He had built a basic weather simulation that used a simplified model, designed to calculate future weather patterns.

One day, while re-running a simulation, Lorenz decided to save time by restarting the calculations from partway through. He manually inputted the numbers from halfway through a previous printout.

But instead of inputting, let's say, 0.506127, he entered 0.506 as the starting point of the calculations. He thought the small difference would be insignificant.

He was wrong. As he later told the story: ""I started the computer again and went out for a cup of coffee. When I returned about an hour later, after the computer had generated about two months of data, I found that the new solution did not agree with the original one. […] I realized that if the real atmosphere behaved in the same manner as the model, long-range weather prediction would be impossible, since most real weather elements were certainly not measured accurately to three decimal places.""

There was no randomness in Lorenz's equations. The different outcome was caused by the tiny change in the input numbers.”

Below are mentioned the things (exhaustive list) that I avoid during my battle of winning from candida overgrowth, possibly a systemic one. All of these listed things cause a rash outbreak which takes 2 days to completely heal. Today I am able to manage to be skin-breakout free most days if I avoid these triggers. After going through this thread for so long, after fighting and losing the battle so many days I have found the key to stay functional and happy in my days while I still battle to completely rid myself of candida overgrowth. So please, bear with me and believe me when I say, do these things for a few days religiously and you will understand. Again I wish you luck on your journeys, for all our journeys are different, but we are homo sapiens after all, we aren't all that different :) Love.

These are lesser known things and does not include the obvious things such as following a candida diet.

1. No hummus 
2. No bananas or any other sugary fruit. Infact i'd suggest no fruits for the first 30 days of you trying this out. Please just trust me 🙏🏼
3. No coffee. Mould-free, decaf, nothing. I know it's hard, but the clarity (no brain fog), skin glow, physicality you will feel after a few days will make you forget your coffee addiction.
4. Avacados and buck-wheat noodles is the only carbs im having. And I gym heavy and actively. It is enough for me.
5. No masturbation or sexual arousal of any kind. I tried to research why I cannot have any sex or even rub one out, but the histamine thing is as far as I got. Let me know if anyone has any info on why even this causes an episode as much as a sugary cola or Cappucino.
6. No milk. I avoid any milk, dairy or non-dairy. Works like a charm for me. Try it for a month?
7. No gaming!? I love gaming. I am a gamer. Souls players in the house give me a holler! But these games I guess cause stress and anxiety of some form. Any video games cause me to breakout and set me back on my journey of recovery.

It took me months to figure all of this out through trial and error. I finally have cracked it. It really works for me. These are tough to do by themselves. Doing them all together is a mountain task!!! Use your family, your friends and confide in them that you are battling something tough. Meditate, do yoga, read books, avoid too much social media. Spiraling is a thing. Stay calm during this healing period, avoid things that agitate or animate you too much. Catch your breath regularly. Take sun. Walk, run, exercise.

\- Something with more 'real' impact. Even in my experience as a barista, I made coffee, talked with people, contributed to a community, helped a coffee shop run. I'm hoping there are more sustainable careers than barista that provide this (maybe a doctor would but it feels a bit late for that at 27).

\- A career trajectory that doesn't require always working for a massive company. This could be a small 5 person accounting/law firm, or starting a private practice etc. Some career where this is in the cards.

\- Ideally something that involves people. I really enjoy talking to and working with people.

I have the coffee table above and also some similar dark/walnut colored wood benches I’d like to put at the table. I have been searching for a table that doesn’t feel too clunky and has a similar aesthetic beveled/rounded edges and thin legs, but have been coming up short. I have looked for both rectangular and oval shapes and have found anything between 47 and 60 inches long.

The closest thing I’ve found is this Castlery table, but the legs aren’t quite right.

Only just these past few months have I started to go on dating apps and speak to guys, I've not really found anyone I've been interested in until last week. I really got along with this guy, common interests and thought I was beautiful etc. In the beginning of the convo I was very clear that I'm plus size and if he's not into that that's completely fine, and he was bigger himself and emphasised that he was completely fine with my size and attracted to me. I also said that I'm not into being fetishised, he didn't drop any hints that he was into that.

We had a date tomorrow, to get coffee together. And today, after I've done my nails and toes, took a full body shower, plucked my eyebrows, used my hair and skincare that I reserve for special occasions and I was even going to bake him some cookies to try that we spoke about. He then sent me a long message about how he's into feederism and that he understands it's not for everyone and he likes me for me not his kink etc. I feel so humiliated. I feel gross and I feel like all security and confidence I had has just been destroyed. I really thought I found someone that liked me for ME myself, not because I'm fat. I sent him a voice note saying that I was clear I'm not into his fetish, and he had the opportunity to tell me then no? But instead he's told me just before our date. 

I really feel like all my trust in potential partners has completely gone. I'm a really sceptical person usually, and it took so much time for him to break down my walls all to end up doing that. I hate feeders, and I hate my body for attracting them too.",22,1738874707.0,PlusSize,14,0.89,False

Sometimes I'm a messy person and let things go a little too long... but I've really stepped up my game from how I used to be. She's mentioned she feels as if she takes on a lot of the mental load of cleaning and meal providing but I disagree. I make dinner and help clean. Sometimes her expectations are too high and she acknowledges that... she knows sometimes she cant even meet them. Today she mentioned that I don't do enough and I felt really hurt and unseen. I feel like I do a lot for her. I just want to feel like a man. Her man. What are things I could be doing better? or some philosophy's on loving women right?

I'm also trying to understand love languages as she said hers are Acts of Service. However it doesn't feel right to be cleaning up after a person or just doing labor for them. I'm here to have teamwork and not just do things for her.

Also... sometimes I feel attacked when she brings up how she wants things to be different. Sometimes it feels like she wants a different person and it hurts me. I really want this to work and to be the person she wants me to be. But sometimes I feel like my plate is too full and I can't.

I was walking home with a coffee in hand, passing through an alley behind my apartment, when I noticed a large flock of birds circling above my apartment building. As I looked up to check them out, I immediately saw three *very* bright lights high above them, just hanging there in the sky.

As soon as I spotted the lights, the birds scattered.

The lights didn’t make any sense. They were in sort of a triangle formation and moving slowly but definitely weren’t helicopters or airplanes. All three were blinking—very noticeably.

After watching for a while, I headed inside, grabbed my binoculars, and went back out. Through the binoculars, it seemed like they had some sort of shape, sorta pointy. My first thought was something shaped like the *lunar lander*—bright, shiny, and with angles and points.

I was trying to see if maybe they were objects that were rotating and reflecting the sun's light as they did so, but through the binoculars the blinking was even more intense. It was a distinct *ON / OFF / ON / OFF* like a blinker. And extremely bright.

I watched for maybe five minutes? Mostly with my naked eye or through binoculars. At some point, I decided to try filming, but because of the bright daylight, I couldn’t see my phone screen at all—so I had no idea if I was actually capturing anything. I just pointed the camera in the general direction and hoped for the best.

These lights continued to move around slowly. Eventually, two of them started to move away while one remained, and I just stopped watching and went inside.

Had a phonecall or two thrown in there as well. She seemed laid back, fun, and pretty easy to talk to.

After about 5 days of messaging back and forth we arranged to meet up in the city for our first face to face date. As we had been getting on so well we decided to go for a meal at a nice restaurant, rather than the coffee dates that I'd been trying his fat with other potential matches. So I booked the table (long before COVID, so no credit card taken), and we met up at the restaurant.

I got a feeling early on that I maybe didn't meet her expectations looks wise. She seemed a little sombre at the start of the date but we soldiered on and she seemed to relax and we started to have fun. Or so I thought.

She was pouring the wine into herself all through the meal, I thought she was nervous but she got herself a bit drunk. After the main course she excused herself to the toilet. Less than a minute later, I got a text from her in the bathroom. 

""This date is rubbish, he's brutally ugly and I'm not having fun. Can you call me in about 5 minutes and I'll pretend there's an emergency?"" She had clearly not meant to send this to me but in her drunken state had just started typing on the last message she sent (she messaged me to say she was on her way before the date started).

I beckoned the waiter over as I pulled my coat on and told her "" my wife has gone to the bathroom and I've just had a call from work. There's an emergency I have to deal with. She has the credit card, she will square up the bill"".

After some research, I went with this stainless steel one:

Pulled some decent shots since, but today I also swapped the shower screen for the IMS GA200NT Nano and noticed something weird with the water flow (see attached pics/videos). Looks like part of the water is channeling from the top of the shower plate holder, which didn’t seem right.

https://reddit.com/link/1ijcq5c/video/t42100vzwkhe1/player

After some investigating, I think this holder might not be the right fit for my machine—it seems like it should have an edge all around to ensure a proper seal, like the original one did. Right now, there’s likely a gap all around. Lesson learned! Just because something says ""Suitable for Gaggia Classic"" doesn’t mean it works for every model.

Seems like this one would’ve been the better choice:

1ijc7n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1ijc7n6/crisis_the_april_countercoup/,[CRISIS] The April Counter-Coup,"## The April Counter-Coup, Portuguese Civil War of 1974

Only a month had gone by after General António de Spínola's shocking coup d'état on March 13th when political unrest erupted in Portugal once more. With the help of underground communist networks, highly armed leftist elements in the military began a fierce counter-coup on the morning of April 17, 1974, with the goal of toppling the newly formed Junta of National Salvation. Codenamed Operação Liberdade, the well-planned uprising aimed to take control of important Lisbon installations and form a revolutionary socialist administration affiliated with the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP).

Spínola was unaware that the radical faction of the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), which had been pushed out during the March uprising, had been secretly assembling and strengthening its forces in the weeks that followed. Enraged by Spínola's alleged reversal on the decolonisation issue and his inability to completely demolish the Estado Novo's oppressive apparatus, these revolutionary commanders were resolved to seize control of the political transition and drastically shift it to the left. Most importantly, they could rely on the backing of a covert coalition of armed underground cells, far-left political organisations, and communist militants who had been planning for an anti-fascist uprising for a long time. The Brigadas Revolucionárias (BR), the covert armed wing of the PRP (Partido Revolucionário do Proletariado), which was established by Isabel do Carmo and Carlos Antunes following a break from the PCP in 1970, served as the central component of the rebel network. The BR had carried out a series of bold bombings and bank robberies to topple the faltering government in the months preceding Spínola's coup. The gang had frantically gathered weaponry smuggled from Algeria and Eastern Europe and recruited among radicalised troops and students in anticipation of a final battle.

When the DGS secret police stopped a significant arms shipment to the PCP at the port of Lisbon in January, it gave the insurrectionists an unanticipated boost to their preparations. There were enough Czech-made assault weapons, light machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, explosives, and ammo in the stockpile to outfit a small guerrilla army. Before the new authorities could catalogue and destroy the contraband, quick-thinking radicals with supporters inside the military and police were able to take away most of it to safe homes in the Lisbon industrial district when the Spínola coup took place two months later. The vital firepower for the impending uprising would come from these weapons.

The counter-coup was launched in the pre-dawn hours, with near-simultaneous strikes on strategic targets across the capital. Shortly after 3:00 AM, a heavily armed detachment of rebel paratroopers stormed the Monsanto air base on the city's outskirts, quickly overpowering the stunned garrison. Within minutes, radical navy elements seized the Salazar suspension bridge and the riverside Belém Palace, the official presidential residence. The lightning capture of the installations gave the insurgents a commanding position overlooking central Lisbon. In the meantime, insurgent-aligned armoured troops thundered out of their barracks in Mafra and Vendas Novas and quickly established blocking positions on the city's main approach roads. Using sand-bagged strong posts and roving teams armed with the characteristic Czech-made rifles from the stolen armaments shipment, the rebels had taken control of the magnificent Praça do Comércio, Bairro Alto, and important squares by 4:00 AM. To stop any loyalist counterattack, civilian collaborators set up homemade roadblocks made of burning tyres, broken cars, and construction debris.

In the pre-dawn darkness, rebel paratrooper hit teams, guided by BR fighters who knew the building's layout from their time working for a civilian cleaning company contracted to the facility, stormed the sprawling National Salvation Junta headquarters in Belém. Amid the chaos and thick smoke, an MFA unit under Captain Salgueiro Maia fought its way into the main building. Outside the council room, in a tense standoff, they demanded the immediate surrender of the Junta members and the resignation of General Spínola as interim head of state. When Spínola flatly refused, and with loyalist reinforcements from the commandos and GNR reportedly racing to the scene, Maia ordered his men to storm the chamber. In the ensuing melee, Spínola and three other Junta officers were wounded by grenade fragments before the rebels finally subdued the diehards. Bleeding from a head wound but still defiant, the general was hauled away to a waiting helicopter for ""protective custody"" at the Monsanto air base along with other captured Junta members.

Simultaneously, insurrectionist units seized the state radio and television broadcast centres, the Marconi telecommunications hub, the central post office, and the Portela international airport. Soon, the cityscape was peppered with hastily constructed rebel strongholds, frequently situated in stark contrast to the everyday routine of urban life. Baffled citizens emerging from their homes as dawn broke on April 17 were confronted with the surreal sight of shopkeepers opening for business and coffee-drinkers nonchalantly sipping their morning espresso mere metres from heavily armed checkpoints. In the revolutionary stronghold of Setúbal, militant port workers led by the PCP's Metalworkers Union occupied the city's massive industrial complex, barricading the gates and forming workers' militias openly brandishing smuggled rifles and dynamite. Roadblocks sprang up on the main arteries entering the city manned by students and unemployed youth, many sporting the Stalinist hammer and sickle or the Angolan MPLA flag. In the impoverished rural Alentejo, landless labourers rallied to the PCP's radical call for collectivisation, storming the latifundia estates and destroying land records amid scenes of ritual humiliation of conservative landowners.

In a nationwide address on rebel-controlled media, Captain Maia, flanked by representatives from the MFA, PRP, and PCP, proclaimed the overthrow of the ""fascist lackey"" Junta of National Salvation and the establishment of a Provisional Revolutionary Council. The new ruling body, he declared, would be composed of ""progressive elements of the armed forces"" and ""authentic representatives of the workers"" committed to the immediate liberation of the colonies and the construction of a socialist society along Marxist lines. With millennial zeal, Maia declared that the ""clique of reactionary generals and monopoly capitalists"" will be held accountable for their crimes against the populace and face revolutionary justice. Spínola and his fellow ""putschists"" would stand trial for treason before people's tribunals, while the parasitic monopolies and banks would be expropriated into the ""patrimony of the workers."" The Provisional Council's first order of business, he vowed, would be to dispatch ceasefire delegations to Guinea-Bissau, Angola, and Mozambique to arrange the transfer of power to the PAIGC, MPLA, and FRELIMO respectively.

The proclamation sent shockwaves through a population still digesting the leftward lurch of the March events. For conservative Catholics in the northern smallholder belt, the fiery talk of people's tribunals and collectivisation conjured nightmarish visions of Spain 1936. Rumours swirled of an imminent communist reign of terror, fuelled by reports of BR hit squads prowling the streets and Marxist students ""requisitioning"" vehicles and weapons. Anxious crowds besieged police stations and GNR barracks demanding arms to defend home and Church, as parish priests harangued the faithful to resist the godless onslaught. As word of the Lisbon events spread, spontaneous resistance erupted in the northern cities of Porto and Braga, where ad-hoc barricades of trams and furniture sprang up to thwart rebel forces. Crowds singing hymns and waving crucifixes surrounded the army garrison in Braga, appealing to the staunchly Catholic officers to honour their oaths to king and faith. In downtown Porto, a hastily assembled ""United Front of Patriotic Catholics"" seized the cathedral bells, ringing them frantically to rouse the population, while armed vigilantes confronted MFA pickets on the outskirts.

However, the MFA-PCP gamble was a massive political blunder. The counter-coup sparked widespread fear and disgust among a public already reeling from months of dizzying change, rather than uniting the nation behind the revolutionary banner. The idea of a hard-left tilt was too much for many moderate officers, even those who were deeply unhappy with Spínola. The most severe worries of a communist takeover were only reinforced by the active involvement of the long-decried PCP and its armed underground proxies, who were openly displaying Soviet bloc weapons. Loyalist military circles were shocked by the news of the counter-coup, which suddenly made the situation clear and inspired the officer corps to take action. Units that had hesitated in the early hours of confusion now rallied to put an end to what they increasingly perceived to be a communist takeover. As loyal tank columns from the Santa Margarida and Amadora bases advanced on rebel-held Lisbon and air force Fiat G.91 planes flew overhead in a display of power, the tide started to change.

In the capital, a furious street battle erupted as loyalist commandos and paratroopers counterattacked rebel positions in Bairro Alto and along the Avenida da Liberdade. Amid the rattle of small arms fire and the boom of tank cannons, ragtag bands of armed civilians, shopkeepers, and off-duty policemen joined the fray on the government side, enraged by the far-left putsch. The outnumbered rebels fell back in disarray to the working-class districts of Alcântara and Moscavide, erecting new defence lines of overturned cars and sandbags amid the warren-like streets. The Provisional Revolutionary Council, increasingly desperate, resorted to indiscriminate artillery fire on the loyalist-held city centre from its last remaining strongholds, killing scores of civilians and turning the Avenida da Liberdade into a moonscape of shattered facades and burned-out vehicles. Spínola, meanwhile, was freed from captivity in a daring raid by a GNR special operations detachment that overran his lightly guarded villa on the outskirts of Monsanto.

Arriving at the Quartel do Carmo in a GNR armoured car still wearing a bloodstained bandage, a visibly shaken Spínola struggled to assert his authority over the chaotic loyalist forces. As the general vacillated, a coterie of hardline officers led by General Kaúlza de Arriaga, a hero of the colonial wars, seized the initiative. Arriaga had initially been arrested in Mozambique on orders of General Costa Gomes, who sat on the National Salvation Junta with Spínola, for his hardline stance against negotiations with FRELIMO and Tanzania. However, members of the military police loyal to him facilitated his escape, allowing him to return to Lisbon unscathed. Wasting no time, Arriaga and his allies deployed elite units to strategic points, ruthlessly purging waverers and suspected leftists. As night fell on April 17th, a vengeful Arriaga, now the power behind an increasingly bewildered Spínola, ordered an all-out assault on the remaining rebel strongholds.

The result was a night of terror that would long haunt the Portuguese psyche. Loyalist forces, their ranks swollen by civilian vigilantes and ultranationalist militias, stormed into the working-class bastions of the revolutionaries, indiscriminately targeting suspected leftists. Summary executions, beatings, and even lynchings proliferated as a years-long litany of resentments found release in an orgy of reactionary violence. The BR and MFA holdouts resisted desperately, turning entire neighbourhoods into fortified redoubts amid the carnage. In the Lisnave shipyards, cornered militants fought to the last, only succumbing when Arriaga, his patience exhausted, unleashed a devastating aerial bombardment that left much of the area a burning ruin. By the afternoon of April 18th, the back of the Lisbon uprising had been broken. As army sappers gingerly picked their way through the rubble, haggard rebels, hands laced behind their heads, stumbled out to surrender. Spínola, eager to assert a modicum of authority, declared an uneasy truce, but not before up to 500 had perished in the convulsive violence. Among loyalists and conservatives, the taste of victory was sweet, a welcome and bloody riposte to the impudence of the left.

However, the ""normalisation"" of the capital turned out to be a lie. Word of a widespread rebellion in the rural south spread as soon as the last fires were put out. Long established among the landless labourers in the vast hinterlands of the Alentejo, the local PCP had taken advantage of the occasion to provoke the most significant jacquerie in contemporary Portuguese history. The landed estates had been overrun by peasant Soviets carrying hunting rifles and agricultural implements, flying the red banner, arresting landlords and announcing a new system of collectivised agriculture. A GNR rural patrol's poorly thought-out action, in which it opened fire on a vengeful crowd, killing twelve people, only served to fuel the fires. The insurgency spread alarmingly quickly as April turned into May. Soon, the official institutions of state power were essentially replaced by a patchwork of revolutionary committees commanded by PCPs known as ""Red Communes,"" which occupied the industrial belt from Setúbal to the Algarve. A nascent ""United Front for Faith and Fatherland"" emerged in the north, an uncomfortable coalition of far-right nationalists, parish priests, and conservative smallholders bound solely by their devotion to Salazar's national-Catholic heritage and their hate of communism. Supported by weapons smuggled across the Spanish border or stolen from nearby GNR barracks, the movement quickly established control of important towns and transportation routes north of the Mondego River.

As the opposing factions rallied, each claiming to reflect the real nature of the country, the threat of civil war loomed. The events of April presented the PCP and its far-left allies with a historic chance to finally break the bonds of imperialist capitalism and fulfil the unfinished job of the republican revolution. The septuagenarian leader of the party, Álvaro Cunhal, praised the ""heroic struggle of the working masses"" from his exile in Prague and demanded the formation of a ""unitary front of all anti-fascist forces"" in order to put an end to the reaction. In Porto, the newly-formed ""League for National Salvation,"" a hastily cobbled together coalition of conservative notables, business leaders, and military officers, thundered that the very soul of Portugal was imperilled by the ""red menace."" Only a swift restoration of order and a resolute defence of traditional values, they argued, could avert the country's descent into godless anarchy. As a gaggle of disgraced Estado Novo veterans reemerged to lend their support, the League increasingly took on the appearance of a thinly-veiled vehicle for authoritarian restoration.

With his flexibility dwindling daily, Spínola found himself wedged between revolution and reaction. Both the left and the right openly mocked his public calls for rest and moderation, and his ""inactivity"" in the face of the escalating storm earned more and more criticism from his alleged supporters. The general had to decide between being accommodating and becoming irrelevant because Arriaga was now publicly calling for a ""state of siege"" and the suspension of all political liberties. Soon, circumstances compelled him to act. The PCP-led Intersindical federation called for a national strike on May 4th, which resulted in a fresh outbreak of violence in the Setúbal industrial area that left 12 people dead and numerous others injured. An irate Spínola gave a final ultimatum on national television as the nation teetered on the edge. In addition to denouncing the ""wreckers of democracy,"" he suspended the Junta's promise to hold elections within a year and imposed a 90-day state of emergency. The ""irresponsible elements"" on both sides, he said, had forced him to declare emergency powers in order to prevent ""anarchy and civil war.""

The declaration of emergency powers proved to be Spínola's last significant act as Portugal's leader. Within days, the country descended into full-scale civil war as the communist-controlled south and the conservative north effectively split into two rival administrations. The ""Red Communes"" of the Alentejo and Setúbal industrial belt pledged allegiance to a ""People's Republic of Portugal"" proclaimed by the PCP in Évora, while the ""United Front for Faith and Fatherland"" declared a ""National Salvation Government"" in Porto. As NATO allies watched with growing alarm, Portugal's armed forces fractured along ideological lines, with units either defecting to one of the warring camps or attempting to maintain a precarious neutrality. What had begun as Spínola's promise of controlled democratisation had devolved into Europe's first civil war since 1939.",7,1738872975.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

Right at this moment I'm watching his latest music video 'Easy Lover' and crying tears of joy because I am so happy he exists in the world! He brings me so much happiness and I couldn't imagine my life without him. How did I even function pre-JYP?? Coffee before work to wake up? Nah, just give me some JYP in my headphones and I will get through the day A-okay.

I probably have some undiagnosed mental health issues probaby ADHD or bipolar or something cos I swear this amount of emotion for some 50yr old Korean man is legitimately insane.

But fuck, I'm in with this SOULMATE shit for life. Live JYP or die.",7,1738872865.0,kpoopheads,3,0.9,False
1ijc5cp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ijc5cp,[Offered] Short term sublet for a furnished master bed and bathroom in West LA starting March 1st to June 1st.,"Looking for someone to sublet my room with en-suite bathroom from March 1st to June 1st. The location is West LA/Sawtelle area in a very great and safe neighbourhood. The room will come furnished with a full size bed and a desk and tons of closet space. The rent is $1350 plus utilities (Gas, Internet and Electricity), the apartment also has a dishwasher and there is a laundry unit in the building. 

You will be sharing the apartment with my roommate, 30M, introverted extroverted guy who mostly keeps to himself. He works out of an office and is gone most of the day.

The building is close to a few coffee shops, target and a smart final, all within walking distance. 

About you: Ideally someone who’s looking for a place for 3 months, has stable income and proof and someone who likes to clean up after themselves and is easy to live with. 

Please reach out if you’re interested or if you have any questions. ",0,1738872819.0,LARentals,0,0.5,False
1ijc501,https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/1ijc501/is_this_a_realistic_business_plan_for_a_video/,Is this a realistic business plan for a video production business?,"I work in marketing and have a few years of general video production / video editing experience. Most of my work has been in corporate / mini-doc format and commercial. 

In recent months, a buddy and I have been getting more serious about it, and have acquired a lot of quality gear. 

With more experience we’re interested in starting a production house and our basic plan to start is this:

We live in a small-medium size city (100,000 people). There are a couple major cities 1-3 hours away). We’d want to start by doing some jobs on the cheap around our town to build a portfolio up, and then use those videos to shop for potential clients in the same industries but in the major cities, charging full price there. 

So for instance there’s a new coffee shop in town we’d like to shoot a video for, and use that to pitch coffee shops in the city for similar work. 

I’d love some critiques of this plan, and if you think cold contacting businesses isn’t a smart path.
