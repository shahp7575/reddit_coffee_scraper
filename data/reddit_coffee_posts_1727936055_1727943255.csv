**Market Trends:**

**Automation and Digitization:** Automation is revolutionizing the beverage processing industry by enhancing efficiency and reducing operational costs. Manufacturers are increasingly integrating smart technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced sensors into their equipment. These technologies allow real-time data monitoring, enabling manufacturers to detect and address issues before they lead to production downtime. Predictive maintenance tools analyze machine performance, predicting when repairs or maintenance are needed, which prevents costly breakdowns. Automation also helps in improving the consistency and quality of the beverages produced, minimizing human errors. The trend toward fully automated production lines is helping companies meet the growing demand while maintaining high production standards.

**Sustainability and Energy Efficiency:** Sustainability has become a key focus for beverage processing companies due to increasing environmental concerns and regulatory pressures. Manufacturers are seeking energy-efficient equipment that reduces power consumption and lowers carbon footprints. This shift is also driven by consumer preferences for eco-friendly and ethically produced beverages. Equipment designed to conserve water and reduce waste during the production process is gaining traction. For example, systems that can recycle heat and water or use renewable energy sources are increasingly being adopted. Sustainable practices also extend to packaging, where beverage companies are opting for recyclable materials and eco-friendly designs. The move toward greener operations not only helps companies comply with environmental regulations but also enhances their brand image in an increasingly eco-conscious market.

**Rising Demand for Non-Alcoholic Beverages:** The global trend toward healthier lifestyles is driving a significant increase in the consumption of non-alcoholic beverages, such as fruit juices, functional drinks, sports beverages, and plant-based beverages. Consumers are looking for healthier alternatives to sugary sodas and alcohol, and this shift is pushing manufacturers to invest in specialized equipment that can handle the unique processing needs of these beverages. Plant-based drinks, for example, require different techniques for processing ingredients like soy, almonds, or oats. Functional beverages that offer health benefits, such as those enriched with vitamins, minerals, or probiotics, also require precise formulations and equipment to maintain the integrity of their ingredients. As this market continues to expand, beverage processing companies are adapting their machinery to produce a wider variety of healthy and non-alcoholic beverages.

**Customization and Flexibility:** Consumers are increasingly demanding customized and unique beverage options, whether it’s a new flavor of a popular drink or a personalized beverage tailored to their specific tastes. This shift has led to a growing need for flexible beverage processing equipment that can easily switch between different products without significant downtime. Manufacturers are investing in modular machinery that can handle multiple beverage types on a single production line, including both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. This flexibility is also crucial for smaller, niche beverage brands that often require smaller production batches and frequent product changes. Customization capabilities allow companies to meet the demand for a wide range of beverage products, from craft sodas and kombuchas to specialty coffee drinks and flavored water.

**Expansion of Emerging Markets:** Emerging economies, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa, are witnessing rapid growth in the beverage industry due to rising disposable incomes and changing consumer preferences. As middle-class populations expand and urbanization increases, there is a growing demand for both traditional and innovative beverage products. To capitalize on this opportunity, global beverage companies are investing heavily in expanding their production capabilities in these regions. This includes upgrading existing facilities with advanced processing equipment and establishing new manufacturing plants to meet local demand. The expansion into these markets not only boosts sales but also allows companies to benefit from lower production costs and gain a foothold in rapidly growing regions.

**Market Opportunities:**

The global beverage processing equipment market presents significant growth opportunities driven by increasing consumer demand for innovative and healthier beverage options, such as plant-based drinks, functional beverages, and low-sugar alternatives. With rising health consciousness, manufacturers are investing in equipment capable of handling complex formulations and natural ingredients. Emerging markets, particularly in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa, offer vast potential due to growing middle-class populations, urbanization, and evolving consumer preferences. Additionally, advancements in automation, energy-efficient systems, and sustainable processing technologies are creating opportunities for companies to enhance production efficiency, reduce operational costs, and meet stringent environmental regulations. The trend towards customization and small-batch production also opens doors for flexible and modular equipment solutions, catering to niche and personalized beverage demands.

1fv2jy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Machines/comments/1fv2jy3/best_coffee_pod_machines_single_serve_and_pot/,Best Coffee Pod Machines - Single Serve and Pot Brewers,"After dabbling with different coffee brewing methods, I finally embraced the convenience of coffee pod machines. Each one brought something unique to the table, so here’s a rundown of my personal experiences with some of the best models out there, and what I liked—and didn’t like—about them.

### 1. Nespresso Vertuo Plus

This machine was a game-changer for me. The Vertuo Plus offers versatility in a way that other machines just can’t. Whether I wanted a single espresso shot or a larger 18-ounce cup of coffee, it handled both with ease. I really enjoyed the centrifuge technology, which spins the pods at high speed to extract the coffee, giving every cup a smooth crema. What really blew me away was the barcode-reading technology. It automatically adjusts the brewing settings based on the pod you insert, so I never had to worry about messing up the strength or flavor.

The downside? You’re locked into using their proprietary dome-shaped pods, which are pricier than standard coffee pods. Also, while the machine delivers great coffee, the large cups weren’t as strong as I expected, but for quick, consistent coffee at different sizes, the Vertuo Plus made my mornings so much easier.

**Benefits:** Versatility in drink sizes, rich crema, and hassle-free brewing. **Downside:** Cost of pods and slightly weaker large cups.

### 2. Nespresso Essenza Mini (OriginalLine)

When I was in the mood for a true espresso, the Essenza Mini became my go-to. It’s compact and delivers that rich, concentrated shot you’d expect from a traditional espresso machine, thanks to its 19-bar pressure system. The flavor was consistently bold and smooth, and I appreciated how simple the machine was—just pop in a pod, press a button, and my espresso was ready in under a minute.

The downside here is that it’s purely for espresso, so if I wanted a larger coffee, I’d have to brew multiple shots or switch to a different machine. Also, the pods can be a bit pricey, though I found third-party options that worked fine and were cheaper.

**Benefits:** Perfect espresso shots, compact design, and easy to use. **Downside:** Limited to smaller espresso drinks, and pods can be expensive.

### 3. Keurig K-Café SMART

I was impressed by the K-Café SMART because it attempts to bridge the gap between regular coffee and specialty drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. The BrewID technology is a nice touch—it recognizes the K-Cup and adjusts the brewing process accordingly, which led to more consistent coffee. Plus, the **built-in milk frother** was a win when I wanted to make quick lattes or cappuccinos without dragging out a separate frother.

However, the espresso-style drinks didn’t quite match the richness of Nespresso machines. They were fine for casual lattes, but if you’re used to a strong, true espresso flavor, it might leave you wanting more. That said, it’s a solid option for those who want versatility and variety, and I liked that I could still brew a regular cup of coffee when needed.

**Benefits:** Versatile, makes lattes and cappuccinos, and BrewID tech ensures consistent brews. **Downside:** Espresso drinks are weaker compared to Nespresso.

### 4. Keurig K-Mini Plus

If you’re tight on counter space like I was, the K-Mini Plus is perfect. This compact machine is straightforward, no-nonsense, and great for single-serve brewing. It’s small but still has a **removable water tank** and an adjustable drip tray, which I loved for its convenience. The bold brew option was great for those days when I needed an extra kick.

The main drawback was that it’s limited in features—there’s no frother or advanced brewing options, so it’s really for quick, simple cups of coffee. If you’re someone who likes a bit of customization, you might feel it’s too basic. But for me, when I was in a rush, this machine got the job done efficiently.

**Benefits:** Compact, convenient, and simple to use with a bold brew option. **Downside:** Very basic, no specialty drink options.

### 5. Bruvi BV-01

The Bruvi BV-01 really caught my attention with its **biodegradable pods** and sleek design. It’s more eco-friendly than most pod machines, which was a big plus for me. The touchscreen interface made it super easy to customize my brews, and it handled a variety of drink types from espresso to large cups of coffee. The coffee tasted great, with a smooth consistency, and knowing I wasn’t contributing to the usual pod waste was a bonus.

That said, the Bruvi is a bit of an investment. It’s more expensive than Keurig and Nespresso, and since it’s a newer system, the variety of pods available is more limited. Still, I loved the quality and sustainability focus.

**Benefits:** Eco-friendly, customizable brewing, and a sleek, modern design. **Downside:** Expensive and limited pod selection.

### 6. xBloom

As someone who enjoys a good pour-over, the xBloom was a pleasant surprise. It combines the convenience of a pod machine with the freshness of **grinding whole beans** from **paper pods**. Each pod contains whole beans, which are ground fresh before brewing. This gave me a more nuanced, complex flavor that you just don’t get from pre-ground pods. It’s perfect for pour-over enthusiasts who want that fresh taste without all the manual effort.

However, it’s on the higher end of the price spectrum, and the machine is a bit larger than some of the other pod machines I’ve used. It also takes a little longer to brew, but if you’re serious about coffee and willing to invest, this machine gives you a truly elevated experience.

**Benefits:** Freshly ground coffee from whole bean pods, amazing flavor, and pour-over quality. **Downside:** Pricey, larger size, and takes a bit longer to brew.

### 7. Cuisinart Coffee Center Grind & Brew Plus

What I liked most about the Cuisinart Grind & Brew Plus was its **dual-brew system**. If I wanted a quick single cup, I could use a K-Cup, but on weekends when I had more time, I could grind my own beans and brew a full pot of coffee. This flexibility made it a standout for me, especially when I had guests over. It also took up less space than I expected for a machine that offers both single-cup and full-pot brewing.

The downside? The grinding process can be a bit noisy, and it’s not the best at making espresso-style drinks. But for someone who likes variety, it’s a great machine for both daily single cups and larger coffee sessions.

**Benefits:** Versatile dual-brew system, great for single cups and full pots, and built-in grinder. **Downside:** Noisy grinder, and not ideal for espresso.

###Frequently Asked Questions about Coffee Pod Machines

This FAQ focuses on coffee pod machines, a popular type of coffee maker. I've gathered insights from various sources to address common questions about these machines:

**What should I consider when choosing a coffee pod machine?**  
Key factors to keep in mind when choosing a machine include:

* **Pod compatibility**: Ensure it works with your preferred pod type (e.g., K-Cups, Nespresso capsules).
* **Versatility**: Look for options like different cup sizes, brew strengths, temperature controls, and the ability to make milk-based drinks.
* **Size**: Consider the machine’s footprint and water tank capacity for your kitchen space and brewing needs.
* **Sustainability**: If eco-friendliness matters to you, explore machines with recyclable or compostable pods.
* **Extra features**: Some machines offer extras like programmable brewing, automatic shut-off, or built-in milk frothers.

**Are coffee pod machines easy to use and maintain?**  
Yes, most coffee pod machines are designed for simplicity. Just insert a pod, select your settings, and brew. Maintenance is straightforward, but regular cleaning and occasional descaling are important to keep the machine running smoothly. Many models have removable parts, like drip trays and water tanks, for easy cleaning.

**How does the coffee quality compare to other brewing methods?**  
There is general consensus that freshly ground beans using methods like pour-over or French press offer better flavor. But pod machines have their advantages:

* **Convenience**: Pod machines are incredibly easy to use and fast, making them perfect for those who value convenience.
* **Consistency**: They offer reliable brewing with minimal effort, delivering a consistent cup every time.

**Do coffee pods expire?** 

Yes, coffee pods have a ""best by"" date, usually found printed on the pod or its packaging. This date indicates when the coffee is likely to be at its peak freshness and flavor. After this date, the quality of the coffee may decline, but it is still generally safe to consume.1 However, remember that coffee pods use pre-ground coffee, so they might not be as flavorful as a cup brewed with freshly ground beans.

**Can I recycle coffee pods?** 

Yes, most coffee pods are recyclable, but the process can vary depending on the brand. For example Keurig has produced K-Cups with polypropylene (#5 plastic), making them 100% recyclable.

**What is a ""soft pod?""** 

Soft pods, unlike the hard plastic pods used by Keurig or Nespresso, are single-use coffee pods designed for drip coffee makers. They are small, flat, round pods containing coffee grounds enclosed in a filter paper. These pods are individually wrapped for freshness and offer compatibility with various coffee maker brands like Bunn, Hamilton Beach, and Black & Decker. While soft pods share a similar appearance with Easy Serving Espresso (E.S.E) pods, they are not interchangeable.

I've been applying for different roles and tweaking my resume to match the job postings. I currently run my own company and manage 10 employees, but I really want to get back into the workforce. I've been applying for jobs since October 2023 and it's been tough. I've been networking on LinkedIn, having a lot of coffee chats, and seeking referrals. Despite this, I'm struggling to secure interviews, and I think it might be my resume. I've made a lot of changes and sought input from recruiters, product managers, and hiring managers. Any feedback would be awesome. Thanks!

So basically I started consuming coffee and settled on moka pot few months ago. Since this was my first venture into coffee world, I did not want to be heavily invested, so I bought a cheap mokapot(₹550) and grinder (₹500). I tried several coffee brands and flavours.

I was seeing so many recommendations on the this sub to use better grinder, I bit the bullet anf bought Timemore C2 from Amazon (₹4200) during sept end sale {I missed the blue tokai sale bug to secure one few months ago}.

Today I tried C2 and since only one component has changed (using same mokapit, same coffee, same process), I can feel the difference in the coffee taste, it's less acidic and extracted more flavours. I am Using click 18 at the moment. I can fully recomend to switch to a better grinder.

Benefits:
- reduced time to grind by 75% (when comparing to cheap grinder)
- better taste in coffee

TLDR: Get a good grinder if you want to enjoy better coffee and want to stick to coffee for long durations.

**1. College Student T-Shirt & Cup Mockup**

https://preview.redd.it/kvs387dixhsd1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6fb06d95ffe67123c3bade075eb443aa2956fd

Keep in mind that it also allows you to create a T-shirt mockup.

Even without design experience, you'll produce a photorealistic result that turns heads.

Simply insert images, upload a logo, change colors, and you're ready to shine!

**2. Espresso Machine Coffee Mockup**

https://preview.redd.it/rk8klnzixhsd1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a52cb04ecd92fe0e7bee8de3ef44a36219a38da

After reviewing numerous coffee cup mockups, I must say this one is my absolute favorite.

It was convenient when I recently worked on coffee shop branding.

Sharing the mockup of the new paper cup on social media was received EXTREMELY WELL.

But you can use it for various other purposes—it works great on your website, in blog posts, and even in newsletters!

You're all set with minimal effort.

**3. Barista Doing Latte Art Mockup**

https://preview.redd.it/ue013npjxhsd1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffbfffe3ca8cafff3c277ed7c7b1595610d73a5a

If this isn't the most appetizing eco-cup mockup on the list, perhaps the one with the donuts below will be.

You can quickly achieve a 100% lifelike result when presenting a new design idea to your client—or even for your own promotion.

And you'll master mockup creation LIKE A PRO, even if you're a coffee shop or brand owner with no design background.

I'm sure your designer has sent you the files—just upload them to Placeit, and that's pretty much it.

**4. Three Coffee Cups Mockup**

https://preview.redd.it/ny0j3akkxhsd1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=f476cb91322b516ca504a94d63dc6311c6504604

Make your presentation of a new coffee paper cup as bold as possible. This three-in-one solution gives you the chance to make your design STAND OUT.

You can decorate all three cups with a single image, design, or logo upload and change their color with just one click.

Additionally, you can add text, a quote, a CTA (call-to-action)—whatever you like!

Con: The only thing that could make this mockup even better is the ability to add designs to each cup individually.

**5. Mockup of a Woman Holding a Coffee Cup**

https://preview.redd.it/ljrxzfelxhsd1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f8333946c7c00cf252ab9e6c16882c4a8ae36d7

I always try to include at least one mockup featuring the product in someone's hand when working on product presentations.

The same principle applies to coffee cups.

I tested this particular example EXTENSIVELY, and it turned out to be very successful. Maybe it's the shadows that make it extra special—who knows?!

The best part is that it works, and that's what matters.

The editing process is similar to other Placeit alternatives. This one also allows you to change the color of the lid.

**6. Mockup of a Paper Cup and Donuts**

https://preview.redd.it/7s9gs07mxhsd1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6cf39a2940da41e49f7312ca1df8294b4406eb1

Yes, this is the coffee cup mockup I was telling you about—coffee and donuts!

Isn't that the best combination to kick off a new day?

I love it, but I try not to indulge every day—you know, to stay healthy.

BUT—you can use it for your promotions every day. Zero calories.

(If only those donuts were edible... I mean, editable.)

**7. Coffee Packaging Mockups (for Branding)**

https://preview.redd.it/4tm3633nxhsd1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=d780c6bed898bcec022698a68b14590a7ebf260c

When I discovered this particular branding mockup featuring a coffee bag and two cups, I knew it would have a significant IMPACT—and I was absolutely right.

The quick and effortless editing process allows you to make it your own in no time.

Similar to the three-in-one version above, the only downside is that you cannot edit the coffee cups individually.

But you'll definitely achieve an incredibly realistic outcome. No one will even realize it's a [packaging mockup](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimock/comments/1frgbsk/how_to_create_packaging_mockup_quickly/), not a real photo.

**8. Coffee Cup in a Woodworking Workshop Mockup**

https://preview.redd.it/lkf5djunxhsd1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=057e8c21b828a37e79bb44f15c4883d09fc7a450

Among all the mockups on this list, this is another one of my favorites—probably because I enjoy woodworking too!

The main focus is on the (Starbucks cup?) mockup, as you cannot change or configure anything else.

The lid is black by default, and there's no option to change its color.

However, you can modify the color of the paper cup, import an image, add a logo, and even text.

It works GREAT for social media marketing campaigns or as a spontaneous post.

**9. Coffee Cup Sleeve Mockup**

https://preview.redd.it/c8jfiisoxhsd1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=36726751f312038ceccc4612c718acbda9b3fb63

No one wants to burn their hands when grabbing a freshly brewed cup of coffee.

A sleeve is essential, which you can showcase with this particular template.

The cup sleeve mockup EMPHASIZES the sleeve exclusively—in other words, you cannot change the paper cup or the lid.

This may limit some users, but if your cups are of the same style, you're in luck—just as I were!

As for the sleeve, you can enhance it with any design and color combination you desire.

**10. Coffee Mug in Hand Mockup**

https://preview.redd.it/qlxoh5npxhsd1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=601fdff14c48038afe9da89a20ccdba0a8ace1f1

So it's not all paper cups—here's a trendy coffee mug mockup that makes an IMMEDIATE impact.

It features a pierced, alternative model getting cozy with a warm mug of her favorite brew.

Instead of jumping straight into mug production, test things out first with a mockup and go from there. Zero inconvenience.

Monday a night before meet she tells me suddenly ""sorry I need to drive with my family somewhere"" and we can't meet. So we reschedule it

2nd time (a night before meet), she gets very flirty for some reason about our meet and stuff, I act chill and try to just agree without giving too much away. It seems that it has triggered her and she says ""forget it, just meet me"", so I try to say sorry that she looks good and stuff as worried that my lack of excitement made her feel sad.

Just as we're both about to end our convo and sleep. She messages, ""sorry I don't even know you and we live too far, so we won't meet, sorry"".
Then she says maybe another time (obviously most likely it means never). 

I just don't get it, it was supposed to be a new friends kind of meet and suddenly she made it like as if it was going to be some ""hot"" date or something. I believe it hurt her feelings that I didn't respond as if I was some massive flirt or something.

I did all I could to recover, complimenting her looks and everything but to no avail, we made plans but never met. I doubt the ""too far"" is actually a reality as she literally goes shopping to that town on a regular basis, at least according to what she used to tell me at the start.

Sorry for long text, please can someone help me make sense out of all this?

It is the only thing that really triggers my tummy and as such, I’ve had to avoid it for years.

I was wondering if there is anything else (legal and safe) which could replicate or somewhat replicate these effects. I’ve considered theacrine but since it is so similar to caffeine, I’m a bit afraid to actually give it a go. Any advice would be appreciated.

- The boy I moved in with became very physically abusive. He would abuse me in front of my parents at times when we would visit but didn’t say anything about it. After a few months of trying to deal with it in my own because I didn’t want to go back to my moms, it got so bad I broke down and called my dad to come get me. I had to move back in with my mom and she was furious even when I tried to explain the abuse. They didn’t believe me even though the roommate that my boyfriend and I had at the time corroborated my story to my dad when he came to get me. Even with an eyewitness they didn’t believe it could be purely his fault and that IF anything did happen, I must’ve done something that warranted it. 

- I got another job right away when I moved back to my moms. After a few months I started dating a boy at work and moved out again. I would’ve done almost anything to get out of that house. He was a heavy drug user but wasn’t abusive. I was still starving myself, was so deeply depressed, and then became vegan to restrict my diet even more and lost over 100 pounds in about a year. I was working at a bank and he was working at the restaurant still but lost his job and we had to move in with my dad. I hated the relationship and was casually texting and kinda flirting with a guy from the bank and the guy I was with found out. He left me and because I had no other transportation I lost my bank job. He moved out while I stayed with my dad. 

- It was at this time while living with my dad that I told him about my grandpa molesting me. He seemed upset at the time but we weren’t super close so he didn’t say anything about it after the initial conversation. He didn’t call any other family members to discuss it or anything. I was maybe 19 at the time. I visited my mom and step dad for dinner one night and told them the same things again and they just brushed it off and didn’t even want to have the conversation with me. I called my papaw and nana and tried to talk to them about it but they just said I should be talking to my parents about those types of things and that I was an adult now and had to be responsible for my choices. No one would hear me. It took so long for me to get the courage to say something and this was the SECOND time I had tried to reach out and no one believed me. Or cared enough to do anything. Eventually I stopped talking about it entirely and everyone went about their lives as normal. 

- I went out on foot a few days after losing my bank job to find a new job and got hired right away at a sandwich shop. I was getting a lot of attention from boys after the weight loss which I was not used to. I began dating a guy and after about 5 months I moved out of my dads and moved in with him at his parents house.  I always felt like I was running from something. Just rushing to move in with whoever wasn’t a parent of mine even if I wasn’t thrilled with everything about the relationship.

- My boyfriend’s mom didn’t like me and told us if we were going to stay together that we had to live in the shed in the backyard. So we fixed things up as best we could and we had some electricity to run a heater at night and have a light at night. We slept on sleeping bags on the plywood floor. I was always sore and cold most nights but at least it wasn’t my parents’ house. I didn’t have a car but my boyfriend did and he would take me to work when I needed. I never asked for anything because I didn’t want to be a burden. 

- I visited my parents for a weekend around this time because I hadn’t seen them in a long time and found out that a few weeks prior my abusive ex boyfriend had showed up at their house looking for me and they invited him in and had dinner with him and prayed with him. After they had been told by our ex roommate again that he had been beating me. They had him stay for dinner as a guest. They didn’t see why I was upset by it and I couldn’t push the issue. That weekend I was getting some things from the basement and my step dad had been drinking and followed me down and felt up my legs and slapped my butt while I was bent over picking up boxes and was muttering things he wanted to do to me. I quickly grabbed my boxes and ran upstairs where my mom was but didn’t know what to do. I left right after.

- I wanted to start over fresh and didn’t know what to do for my future. My bf was in the national guard and said I should join the army so I could go to school and because he would get a bonus if I signed up. I didn’t really have any friends or family at this point to talk things over with so I said yes and did it. I quickly was sent off to boot camp after signing up

- During basic training I was doing well until I started feeling ill and very depressed. I was in the hospital often and was diagnosed with different illnesses and I stopped eating to feel like I could control something. I didn’t want to be in the army, it was just another way to get far away from my family. It was just another escape route but I hated every minute of it. I don’t remember much from the Army. I felt like I was somewhere else in my mind most of the time. When I try to remember things from then it’s just kind of a black hole. 

- 3 months later I went home on winter break and my bf wanted to get married. I didn’t even comprehend the decision and just said yes if it meant I’d have a place to stay permanently that wasn’t my parents house. We got married within the two weeks I was on leave. I cried on my wedding day because I didn’t know if I even wanted to do it but didnt know where to run or what to do. I didn’t feel good about the relationship but it was better than nothing. 

- When I was shipped back to base I got more sick and was starving myself even more and tried to take a bunch of over the counter cold medicine to die. It just made me very sick and gave me the worst headache of my life. They didn’t catch me with the cold medicine but after a chunk of time passed because I’d had a plethora of health/mental health issues they gave me a medical discharge and I went home feeling like a failure.

- When I came home I had saved all of my money in hopes of moving into an apartment with my husband but I found out that he had spent the bonus he got from me signing up on games and clothes and stuff. I had also written him a letter every week in training and they were all still by the front door unopened. We fought a lot. I managed to get a job at a grocery store and we moved into a tiny apartment. 

- A few months after being at the grocery store I found out I was pregnant. I didn’t want to have any kids. I’d always disliked kids and wasn’t ready to be a mom after so much failure. But my husband wasn’t hearing any options. I felt pressured to do the “right thing”. He told his whole family before I was ready to and told my family too so I was trapped. There was nothing I could do but to just let things happen at that point. It was a really rough pregnancy and I had a lot of complications and got very sick and couldn’t make it to work a lot so I was fired from the grocery store. I managed to get unemployment from them  and the army to support us through the pregnancy. I became incredibly depressed because I felt trapped in the pregnancy and trapped into being in a life role I didn’t want. I didn’t want to be a wife or a mom. But it was the only option I felt like I had. So I stayed. I was miserable but I stayed.

- I had my first son at the end of 2012 

- I stayed home with the baby for a short time but my husband lost his job as an emt over marijuana use so 2 weeks after giving birth I had to go find a job to support us. I got a job at a fancy restaurant that had just opened. I had just had surgery to remove my gallbladder a few days before but I had to take the job opportunity while it was there. They were approving all overtime due to it being a new place with lack of staff and constant training. I was working 14-15 hour shifts on my feet. I ripped my stitches from my recent surgery halfway through my second shift but kept working through it. My body felt ill all the time. My feet were so sore I would take my shoes off and walk through the snow to my car in my socks to get some relief. Sometimes my shifts would end and start again so soon after each other that I would sleep in my car for four hours and clock back in again. 

- My husband was getting upset at the time I was spending away working and said I never saw my son but I didn’t have many other options. We fought so so much and I was so overwhelmed so I quit that job and immediately got another job at a mall. 

- My new job made less money and my husband still wasn’t working so we had to move in with his parents. His mom still hated me and I would tip toe around her as best I could but she blew up on me one day screaming and throwing things, almost hitting the baby. She screamed at me to leave. So I moved out that day. I had nowhere else to go but my parents house.

- My parents put us and my son in their dirty bug infested unfinished basement even though they had many empty bedrooms available. My husband was still smoking weed and just laying around and I could never get him to get a job. I found a job at a coffee shop right away because we had to pay my parents rent to stay there. When I was off work I would fill out tons of online applications for my husband and get him interviews but he just wouldn’t go to them. I felt like I was drowning. I reached out to an old friend from highschool who was a guy my age that had also had a baby a while back and was venting. 

- My friend and I decided to hang out at a park nearby and talk because he had recently dealt with some of the same stresses I had. All we did was talk that day. Nothing physical happened and there was no flirting or anything. When I got back to my mom’s house my husband asked where I had been and I told him hanging out with friends at the park. I didn’t want to tell him it was a guy friend because I didn’t want to upset him even though nothing happened. I didn’t realize it but he went through my phone while I was sleeping that night and saw that I met up with a guy and even though the conversation was totally platonic and normal it upset him. 

- I feel asleep the next day and took a nap between my 2 work shifts. When I woke up my son and most of his belongings were gone. My husband was gone and his car was gone. I tried calling with no answer and got scared so I called the police. After several hours of searching around they said he was at his mom’s house and that I couldn’t go get my son and would have to deal with things in court. It was a terrible day and I was so scared and upset and my mom was so angry because it was her birthday and she said I ruined her birthday.

-  I filed for divorce and went through the process and had 50% custody. Was still living with my parents because I had nowhere else to go but it was terrible every day. I was applying for better paying jobs and had an interview at a chili place. My parents dropped me off and I did the interview and they hired me and told me to show up the next day for orientation. I told my parents and they didn’t believe that they would move so fast into orientation after an interview even though they dropped me off and knew exactly where I was interviewing. They made me call the boss of the restaurant on speaker phone so they could confirm I was in fact hired and wasn’t lying to them. I was so embarrassed. The new boss sounded so weirded out by the whole thing. 

- I worked at the chili place a while and then decided to enroll in cosmetology school so I could try and make a career out of something to better take care of my son. So I was working part time, going to school full time, paying my parents rent, and taking care of my self all at the same time. I was so exhausted and was getting so burnt out. My mom got mad at me for seemingly no reason one day while my dad was visiting their house and exploded on me saying I was a whore and I ruined my marriage and everything was all my fault. She demanded to see my phone which I said no to. I wasn’t even talking to anyone because I was so busy with everything else but I was paying for everything I did and owned and said no she could not go through my phone. So she jumped on top of me hitting me and tried wrestling the phone out of my hands in front of everyone who just sat there and watched. Nobody said anything. I got up and went to go downstairs to get out of the situation and she was following behind me saying horrible things and when I wasn’t giving her the reaction she wanted and wasn’t fighting back like she wanted she slapped me across the face and spit at me and called me a cunt.

Heyy so f21 from north europe here. Would love to make new long time friends and have people to talk with. I am happily taken and have no interest in anything more than having friends. I mostly use snapchat for chatting but discord could be okay too. Let's start the talking here though. 🔮

I love anything horror, gothic, pagan, dark and peculiar. HUUUGE coffee lover as it's sometimes the only thing keeping me from insanity in the cold here. I love spending time studying and gaming. Hiking and gym too. I do like to visit a shooting range few times a month too. Interested in cars too and have one of my own too which i do spend time on. My ultimate all time fave game is skyrim but atm i spend my time playing mw3. Would love to find someone to game with!

I do study full time trying to get into med school, but i do work a bit in retail besides that. I do get busy but i always anwser when i have the time. 

My music taste is a bit weird as my fave genres are country and deathcore (i do not need to hear any ""it's not metal"" thank u, i don't care 😂). I do love the lord of the rings and have been crazy about pokemon too for a long time. Patiently waiting for terrifier 3 as it's one of my top faves. 

If ya feel like you'd like to get to know me better, send me a message. 🖤 Please tell me a bit about yourself. There's a 90% chance i won't anwser to only a ""hey"". I would prefer people around 18-30 years old. Someone who loves to keep in touch and helps me keep the convo going would be nice. 

Hope i'll hear from you. 😻

Should be a huge difference! I'm really excited, but I have some questions. 

We usually just grind the coffee, add it to the basket, tamp and pull the shot after the machine is warmed up. Now we'll be grinding into the basket, using the WDT tool, tamping and pulling the shot after the machine has warmed up. Is there anything I'm missing?

We prefer light to medium roast coffee (I drink decaf and he drinks regular that well keep in two seperate hoppers) if that makes a difference. I could also use tips on how fine to grind the beans and how to use the WDT tool (is it as easy as just swishing it around?) Thanks for the help!",1,1727940460.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I often stay awake for 3-4 days straight, and this has been an issue since I was a baby. I've tried numerous treatments; including melatonin, Lunesta, Ambien, and various sedative antidepressants, ramelteon, but nothing has helped. I also completed 12 weeks of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) without any improvement and have undergone countless overnight sleep studies.

Despite consulting many doctors over the years, none have been able to pinpoint the cause of my sleep issues. They don't believe I'm experiencing mania, and they're puzzled by my condition. I don't drink coffee and have completely cut out alcohol. I'm hoping someone here might have insights into potential medications, treatments, or lesser-known disorders that could be affecting me.

It feels like every doctor approaches my situation with the same assumptions, often attributing it to anxiety, suggesting I'm napping during the day, or recommending CBT-I again. Staying awake for 3-4 days without any stimulants isn't normal, and it's causing me significant distress. I can't function during these periods, yet I still can't sleep. I am not sure if there are any rare genetic disorders and or other things that may not be the first thought for doctors but this is absolutely debilitating. I am not exaggerating at all when I say I stay up, no nap, for 3-4 days twice a month at least.

1fv249i,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifestory/comments/1fv249i/looking_for_advice_or_wisdom_from_anyone_at_all/,Looking for advice or wisdom from anyone at all. My story (part 2) ,"** CONTINUED FROM PART 1**

- The boy I moved in with became very physically abusive. He would abuse me in front of my parents at times when we would visit but didn’t say anything about it. After a few months of trying to deal with it in my own because I didn’t want to go back to my moms, it got so bad I broke down and called my dad to come get me. I had to move back in with my mom and she was furious even when I tried to explain the abuse. They didn’t believe me even though the roommate that my boyfriend and I had at the time corroborated my story to my dad when he came to get me. Even with an eyewitness they didn’t believe it could be purely his fault and that IF anything did happen, I must’ve done something that warranted it. 

- I got another job right away when I moved back to my moms. After a few months I started dating a boy at work and moved out again. I would’ve done almost anything to get out of that house. He was a heavy drug user but wasn’t abusive. I was still starving myself, was so deeply depressed, and then became vegan to restrict my diet even more and lost over 100 pounds in about a year. I was working at a bank and he was working at the restaurant still but lost his job and we had to move in with my dad. I hated the relationship and was casually texting and kinda flirting with a guy from the bank and the guy I was with found out. He left me and because I had no other transportation I lost my bank job. He moved out while I stayed with my dad. 

- It was at this time while living with my dad that I told him about my grandpa molesting me. He seemed upset at the time but we weren’t super close so he didn’t say anything about it after the initial conversation. He didn’t call any other family members to discuss it or anything. I was maybe 19 at the time. I visited my mom and step dad for dinner one night and told them the same things again and they just brushed it off and didn’t even want to have the conversation with me. I called my papaw and nana and tried to talk to them about it but they just said I should be talking to my parents about those types of things and that I was an adult now and had to be responsible for my choices. No one would hear me. It took so long for me to get the courage to say something and this was the SECOND time I had tried to reach out and no one believed me. Or cared enough to do anything. Eventually I stopped talking about it entirely and everyone went about their lives as normal. 

- I went out on foot a few days after losing my bank job to find a new job and got hired right away at a sandwich shop. I was getting a lot of attention from boys after the weight loss which I was not used to. I began dating a guy and after about 5 months I moved out of my dads and moved in with him at his parents house.  I always felt like I was running from something. Just rushing to move in with whoever wasn’t a parent of mine even if I wasn’t thrilled with everything about the relationship.

- My boyfriend’s mom didn’t like me and told us if we were going to stay together that we had to live in the shed in the backyard. So we fixed things up as best we could and we had some electricity to run a heater at night and have a light at night. We slept on sleeping bags on the plywood floor. I was always sore and cold most nights but at least it wasn’t my parents’ house. I didn’t have a car but my boyfriend did and he would take me to work when I needed. I never asked for anything because I didn’t want to be a burden. 

- I visited my parents for a weekend around this time because I hadn’t seen them in a long time and found out that a few weeks prior my abusive ex boyfriend had showed up at their house looking for me and they invited him in and had dinner with him and prayed with him. After they had been told by our ex roommate again that he had been beating me. They had him stay for dinner as a guest. They didn’t see why I was upset by it and I couldn’t push the issue. That weekend I was getting some things from the basement and my step dad had been drinking and followed me down and felt up my legs and slapped my butt while I was bent over picking up boxes and was muttering things he wanted to do to me. I quickly grabbed my boxes and ran upstairs where my mom was but didn’t know what to do. I left right after.

- I wanted to start over fresh and didn’t know what to do for my future. My bf was in the national guard and said I should join the army so I could go to school and because he would get a bonus if I signed up. I didn’t really have any friends or family at this point to talk things over with so I said yes and did it. I quickly was sent off to boot camp after signing up

- During basic training I was doing well until I started feeling ill and very depressed. I was in the hospital often and was diagnosed with different illnesses and I stopped eating to feel like I could control something. I didn’t want to be in the army, it was just another way to get far away from my family. It was just another escape route but I hated every minute of it. I don’t remember much from the Army. I felt like I was somewhere else in my mind most of the time. When I try to remember things from then it’s just kind of a black hole. 

- 3 months later I went home on winter break and my bf wanted to get married. I didn’t even comprehend the decision and just said yes if it meant I’d have a place to stay permanently that wasn’t my parents house. We got married within the two weeks I was on leave. I cried on my wedding day because I didn’t know if I even wanted to do it but didnt know where to run or what to do. I didn’t feel good about the relationship but it was better than nothing. 

- When I was shipped back to base I got more sick and was starving myself even more and tried to take a bunch of over the counter cold medicine to die. It just made me very sick and gave me the worst headache of my life. They didn’t catch me with the cold medicine but after a chunk of time passed because I’d had a plethora of health/mental health issues they gave me a medical discharge and I went home feeling like a failure.

- When I came home I had saved all of my money in hopes of moving into an apartment with my husband but I found out that he had spent the bonus he got from me signing up on games and clothes and stuff. I had also written him a letter every week in training and they were all still by the front door unopened. We fought a lot. I managed to get a job at a grocery store and we moved into a tiny apartment. 

- A few months after being at the grocery store I found out I was pregnant. I didn’t want to have any kids. I’d always disliked kids and wasn’t ready to be a mom after so much failure. But my husband wasn’t hearing any options. I felt pressured to do the “right thing”. He told his whole family before I was ready to and told my family too so I was trapped. There was nothing I could do but to just let things happen at that point. It was a really rough pregnancy and I had a lot of complications and got very sick and couldn’t make it to work a lot so I was fired from the grocery store. I managed to get unemployment from them  and the army to support us through the pregnancy. I became incredibly depressed because I felt trapped in the pregnancy and trapped into being in a life role I didn’t want. I didn’t want to be a wife or a mom. But it was the only option I felt like I had. So I stayed. I was miserable but I stayed.

- I had my first son at the end of 2012 

- I stayed home with the baby for a short time but my husband lost his job as an emt over marijuana use so 2 weeks after giving birth I had to go find a job to support us. I got a job at a fancy restaurant that had just opened. I had just had surgery to remove my gallbladder a few days before but I had to take the job opportunity while it was there. They were approving all overtime due to it being a new place with lack of staff and constant training. I was working 14-15 hour shifts on my feet. I ripped my stitches from my recent surgery halfway through my second shift but kept working through it. My body felt ill all the time. My feet were so sore I would take my shoes off and walk through the snow to my car in my socks to get some relief. Sometimes my shifts would end and start again so soon after each other that I would sleep in my car for four hours and clock back in again. 

- My husband was getting upset at the time I was spending away working and said I never saw my son but I didn’t have many other options. We fought so so much and I was so overwhelmed so I quit that job and immediately got another job at a mall. 

- My new job made less money and my husband still wasn’t working so we had to move in with his parents. His mom still hated me and I would tip toe around her as best I could but she blew up on me one day screaming and throwing things, almost hitting the baby. She screamed at me to leave. So I moved out that day. I had nowhere else to go but my parents house.

- My parents put us and my son in their dirty bug infested unfinished basement even though they had many empty bedrooms available. My husband was still smoking weed and just laying around and I could never get him to get a job. I found a job at a coffee shop right away because we had to pay my parents rent to stay there. When I was off work I would fill out tons of online applications for my husband and get him interviews but he just wouldn’t go to them. I felt like I was drowning. I reached out to an old friend from highschool who was a guy my age that had also had a baby a while back and was venting. 

- My friend and I decided to hang out at a park nearby and talk because he had recently dealt with some of the same stresses I had. All we did was talk that day. Nothing physical happened and there was no flirting or anything. When I got back to my mom’s house my husband asked where I had been and I told him hanging out with friends at the park. I didn’t want to tell him it was a guy friend because I didn’t want to upset him even though nothing happened. I didn’t realize it but he went through my phone while I was sleeping that night and saw that I met up with a guy and even though the conversation was totally platonic and normal it upset him. 

- I feel asleep the next day and took a nap between my 2 work shifts. When I woke up my son and most of his belongings were gone. My husband was gone and his car was gone. I tried calling with no answer and got scared so I called the police. After several hours of searching around they said he was at his mom’s house and that I couldn’t go get my son and would have to deal with things in court. It was a terrible day and I was so scared and upset and my mom was so angry because it was her birthday and she said I ruined her birthday.

-  I filed for divorce and went through the process and had 50% custody. Was still living with my parents because I had nowhere else to go but it was terrible every day. I was applying for better paying jobs and had an interview at a chili place. My parents dropped me off and I did the interview and they hired me and told me to show up the next day for orientation. I told my parents and they didn’t believe that they would move so fast into orientation after an interview even though they dropped me off and knew exactly where I was interviewing. They made me call the boss of the restaurant on speaker phone so they could confirm I was in fact hired and wasn’t lying to them. I was so embarrassed. The new boss sounded so weirded out by the whole thing. 

- I worked at the chili place a while and then decided to enroll in cosmetology school so I could try and make a career out of something to better take care of my son. So I was working part time, going to school full time, paying my parents rent, and taking care of my self all at the same time. I was so exhausted and was getting so burnt out. My mom got mad at me for seemingly no reason one day while my dad was visiting their house and exploded on me saying I was a whore and I ruined my marriage and everything was all my fault. She demanded to see my phone which I said no to. I wasn’t even talking to anyone because I was so busy with everything else but I was paying for everything I did and owned and said no she could not go through my phone. So she jumped on top of me hitting me and tried wrestling the phone out of my hands in front of everyone who just sat there and watched. Nobody said anything. I got up and went to go downstairs to get out of the situation and she was following behind me saying horrible things and when I wasn’t giving her the reaction she wanted and wasn’t fighting back like she wanted she slapped me across the face and spit at me and called me a cunt.

I'm looking for a scope for my AR. I've narrowed it down to a second focal plane 1-4x, for a few reasons. They're generally lightweight and affordable, and I'm only ever going to shoot this thing out to 300 yards at the most, *maybe* 400 every once in a while. However, I'm hoping to put it on an early 2010's period build, and as a result I want the scope to be period correct. I've found a few options that all look good, but I'm having a hard time choosing and I'd like some advice.

**Option #1: Trijicon AccuPoint 1-4x24 (TR24R reticle)**

https://preview.redd.it/tzep108gbhsd1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cd47d345c8f03a22f967d8b0b4dd30a123aedeb

It's been around for a pretty long time, seen a lot of good reviews. Much better than the original 1.1-4x model from the early 2000s. It's got two styles of reticle, one is a basic duplex reticle and the other is a weird 4.2 MOA triangle. From my basic research, the triangle seems to be the best option. At 4x it will cover all impacts between \~50-350 yards with a 200 yard zero, though at 1x it grows to \~16.8 MOA which isn't too bad out to 25-50 yards or so but isn't very useful beyond that.

https://preview.redd.it/ebhb7dnychsd1.png?width=1614&format=png&auto=webp&s=320fdb65b056f61807cd80921289be112ee63543

* Length: 10.3"" 
* Weight: 14.4 oz
* FOV: 97.5-24.2 ft
* Eye relief: 2-3.5""
* Adjustments: .25 MOA
* Cost: \~$760

Pros:

* No batteries to worry about
* Decent reticle at 4x
* Solid construction 
* Pretty good light transmission

Cons:

* At 1x, the reticle is 16.8x16.8 MOA, which is pretty hard to use at longer ranges
* Tritium/fiber optic illumination can wash out in certain situations
* No provisions for elevation or windage holds

**Option #2: Leupold Mark 3HD 1.5-4x20 (BDC reticle)**

https://preview.redd.it/j7tchwa3dhsd1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=e456d4825e71f679bbced16c2408c3c29bf34249

Technically it wasn't produced until 2018(?), but it's fundamentally an updated Mark AR Mod 1 1.5-4x20 which was around in my desired time frame. It's much better quality than the Mark AR and has very good light transmission and glass clarity. I debated between the SPR and BDC reticles and eventually figured the BDC reticle would be simpler to use. Leupold doesn't say what ammo or ranges it's calibrated for, but I'll probably have to figure out my rifle's holds anyway so that's not a huge issue. I have two other Leupolds, so I'm giving this one some extra consideration based on how well those two work.

* Length: 9.5"" 
* Weight: 13.1 oz
* FOV: 74.2-29.3 ft
* Eye relief: 3.7-4.2""
* Adjustments: .1 MIL
* Battery life: 300-1800 hours
* Brightness settings: 8
* Cost: \~$700

Pros:

* 1/4 turn from 1.5x-4x
* Great light transmission
* Lightest scope on the list
* Bright dot
* Lifetime warranty

Cons:

* 1.5x minimum magnification, not a huge problem but it might be a bit annoying
* Figuring out the BDC calibration could be a hassle
* No windage stadia

**Option #3: Steiner P4Xi 1-4x24 (P3TR reticle)**

https://preview.redd.it/e7zaxeu8ihsd1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d38234e3b7d54fa5565e4a7ba479992b59ba6d0

I've seen almost universal good reviews about this one. Wasn't available commercially until 2016, but it was available to LE for a few years prior. Wonderful glass, bright red dot, solid construction. Reticle is calibrated for both 5.56 and 7.62, has rangefinding elevation marks for longer range shooting. The few complaints I've seen about the P4Xi mainly come from the turrets being a bit mushy when adjusting them, but I'm not gonna be dialing any of these scope anyway so it's not an issue. Steiner also advertises a 10 hour battery life which is obviously a problem, but other people report it's more like 750 hours.

* Length: 10.3"" 
* Weight: 17.3 oz
* FOV: 110-27.5 ft
* Eye relief: 2-3.5""
* Adjustments: .5 MOA
* Battery life: 10 hours (according to Steiner's website), 750 hours (according to others)
* Brightness settings: 11 (only 5 are for daylight use)
* Cost: \~$600

Pros:

* Great light transmission
* Cheapest scope on the list
* Bright dot
* Reticle is easy to use

Cons:

* .5 MOA adjustments
* Potential battery life concerns
* Seen people report reticle wires and lenses coming loose from minor impacts

**Option #4: US Optics SR-4C (MRAD reticle, dual focal plane)**

https://preview.redd.it/tapwds89nhsd1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66b08f8563ecdeb63ec8f77cc6e98b2ecff71aae

US Optics used to make a lot of really good scopes that unfortunately are no longer in production. The SR-4C was often compared to high end Nightforce and Leupold scopes and I've seen very few complaints about them. The reticle is a simple MRAD crosshair and works very well for rangefinding. It uses a dual focal plane setup where the reticle is first focal plane while the red dot is second focal plane, which prevents the red dot from blooming at high magnification. Illumination is nearly red dot bright and is interestingly controlled by buttons instead of a dial. The biggest issue, besides finding one, is that they were $2,000 when they were new, so even a used one will be almost 3x the cost of the Trijicon.

* Length: 9.25"" 
* Weight: 19.8 oz
* FOV: 110-33 ft
* Eye relief: \~3.7""
* Adjustments: .2 MRAD
* Battery life: 10,000 hours (low setting)
* Brightness adjustments: 12
* Cost: \~$2,000

Pros:

* Great reticle
* Great illumination
* Widest FOV in both 1x and 4x
* Most brightness settings
* Shortest scope on the list

Cons:

* Discontinued, hard to find
* Heaviest scope on the list
* Most expensive scope on the list

1fv2124,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1fv2124/long_distance_crush/,Long distance crush?,"So for backstory, I met this guy last year in May. We hit it off, met through mutual friends/family (my cousin really) for a festival, we were nearly inseparable. Almost all our group pictures we are right next to each other, duo pictures I noticed if I didn’t have my bag with my water bladder on, his hand would have been on my back.  He bought me a drink one night (I don’t drink really), made me drinks at the resort we were at, paid for some of my rides (didn’t charge me on Splitwise and told me not to worry about it) and even held my hand and let me lay on his shoulder, held my head up if it slipped, for the whole ride back to the resort the last day. I realized I had developed a crush, problem was, he was 32 (now 33) and lives in Alaska. 

I’m from Florida and I’m now 22 (just a month shy of 21 when we met).

The only reason I bring any of this up is…
I’m in Alaska. And we’re messaging. And I feel those butterflies that I felt when I was in Las Vegas. I don’t think he likes me but he’s like sort of asking questions now instead of just recommending hiking trails and things to go see in the area.  Also asked what area we are staying in currently. And asked if my granny was okay when I said we had to go look for her on the glacier (I should’ve added more details, she just wandered like maybe 50 yards onto the moderate trail looking for us). Thing is. We leave Saturday to go to a different city that is an 8 hour train ride away… and he’s working the time that I’m here in his city. 
But because he asked me about where we are staying, it made my heart flutter and my stomach do flips. I wish I could actually meet up with him but idk if he’s talking to anyone up here still cuz at the time he was but it wasn’t serious and he has told me that when I apologized cuz a mutual friend told me about this mystery girl. 
Aside from that tho.
I’m really hoping he asks me to get coffee or something… but I really also doubt it. I had a dream about him last night before I had even messaged him about hiking. I messaged him before we left our state to tell him we’d be in town and what days but that’s when he said he has work. I feel like I’m getting ahead of myself honestly. I don’t know how I feel about even feeling the effects of this crush again because I didn’t think it would be so heavy on my mind but all day while hiking I’m envisioning myself hiking one of the days we’re here with him and I know that won’t even happen. It sucks.
I want to like ask him if we could meet up before or after he works or maybe Friday night but it really doesn’t seem like that is going to happen… I’d rather him ask me anyways just because I don’t want to feel rejection or getting turned down cuz the last time we spoke was pretty much him shutting me down and I get it. I’m 22, 11 year age gap isn’t appealing I wouldn’t think, I’m really not even his type honestly, and I live in Florida so anything would be long distance. But I can’t help but wish his stomach did flips when I teased him about his dead battery or his heart fluttered when I said how much I love this state already and how I wish I could move up here.
But I know it’s probably not the same affect or hell, no affect even.

I hate crushing so much dude. It always ends up me getting turned down or something like that.",2,1727939446.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Today, I went to college for assignment checking and some community work (I'm the Vice President of a club, so I have responsibilities). There's this girl who has been hitting on me for the past two months. I recently went through a breakup, and I kind of believe she's the reason behind it, so I decided to stop talking to her. I've been ignoring her for the past week because I’m still trying to recover from the breakup.

Anyway, today she approached me and asked if I wanted to grab a coffee with her. I declined because honestly, I’m still pretty heartbroken and stressed with college exams coming up. She kept insisting, and it was starting to irritate me. I tried to keep calm, but eventually, I snapped and shouted at her in front of her friends. I wasn’t yelling aggressively, but I definitely raised my voice because it was getting to a point where she wouldn't take no for an answer.

After I got home, I started feeling guilty. I messaged my her friends about the situation, and they all said I was wrong for being rude to her. Now I’m conflicted. On one hand, I feel like maybe I should apologize, but on the other hand, I’m dealing with a lot right now—exams, the breakup, everything.

Testing The Genius Wave kicked off with an ambitious goal. Aimed to see if this could really be the game-changer for cognitive abilities, a strict routine was set. Here's how it all went down:

# 

Mark your calendar! Every day, like clockwork, set aside time - precisely 7 minutes after breakfast. Why after breakfast? Well, who doesn't enjoy a side of brainwaves with their morning coffee?

Get comfy - Find that sweet spot in your home where the noise of the outside world fades away. For me, it was the cozy corner by the window, bathed in sunlight and away from the hustle.

Wear headphones - Yes, those fancy ones you only use for special occasions. It turns out soundwave entrainment needs crisp, clear sound to work its magic on your brain.

Close those peepers - Shutting your eyes helps shut out the world. With just you and The Genius Wave, it's less about seeing and more about feeling.

Focus on breathing - Deep breaths in and out set the stage for relaxation and open-mindedness toward the sounds you’re about to hear.

Reflection time – After each session, jot down any changes in mindset or sudden bursts of inspiration on paper (or whatever digital note-taking app you prefer). Noticing patterns over time can be quite enlightening!

Rinse and repeat – Same time, same place, every day for 90 days straight without skipping a beat... or a wave in this case.

Weekly wrap - up sessions included reviewing notes taken throughout the week to identify any significant shifts in anxiety levels, focus, energy levels... or lack thereof.

Pairing with physical exercise – Three times a week, I combined my listening sessions with light jogging or yoga to test if movement encouraged stronger effects; mind-body connection was the buzzword here.

Sharing experiences – Once a week discussions with other testers provided insights into their journeys and added motivation to stick with it even when skepticism tried to creep in.

Final assessment involved comparing notes from Day 1 to Day 90; looking for improvements in mental well-being, creative thinking ability, learning processes enhancements, and yes… whether it made financial planning feel less like navigating through a stormy sea.

The journey had its ups and downs but followed these steps faithfully promised an adventure—a quest towards unlocking potential hidden within waves… sound waves that is!

But, something started shifting. Focus sharpened, ideas flowed more freely, and get this - stress began melting away like ice cream on a hot sidewalk.

Weeks turned into months, and the changes were not subtle; they were monumental. You'd think a superhero had zapped my brain with powers. Work tasks I used to dread now seemed like puzzles waiting to be solved - enjoyment replaced worries.

**Cons**

Let's delve into the less sparkly side of The Genius Wave, shall we? It's not all brain-boosting sunshine and rainbows. Remember, every silver lining has a cloud or two lurking about.

Limited Availability

Official Website Exclusivity

Stock Warnings Stir Concern

Potential Doubts on Effectiveness

Accessibility Concerns for Some Users

90-Day Money-Back Guarantee Leaves Some Skeptical

Here's the thing—getting your hands on The Genius Wave feels a bit like snagging a ticket to a sold-out concert. It's only available on the official website, which means, if you're the type to browse through different platforms before making a purchase, you're out of luck. Talk about putting all your eggs in one basket.

Then, there's the ominous stock warning. It's like the manufacturer is saying, ""Hurry up, or you'll miss out!""—cue the dramatic music. It stirs up a bit of FOMO, doesn't it? Suddenly, you're not just buying a cognitive enhancement tool; you're racing against an invisible clock.

Accessibility, or shall we say the lack thereof, also raises eyebrows. It's like being part of an exclusive club, but not everyone's invited. If you're not tech-savvy or prefer the good old-fashioned in-store shopping experience, you might feel a bit left out in the cold.

And let's not forget the 90-day money-back guarantee. While it sounds reassuring, it's also the source of some skepticism. It raises the question: If it's so effective, why would I need 90 days to change my mind? It's like going on a date and thinking, ""Well, if it doesn't work out, there's always the return policy.""

So, while The Genius Wave promises to be your brain's best buddy, it's not without its quirks and qualms. Like any relationship, it's a mix of the good, the bad, and the ""hmm, let's think about this.""

Personal Experience and Observations

I gave The Genius Wave a shot, skeptical but hopeful. My routine? Seven minutes every day, in the quietest corner of my house. Imagine that - just seven minutes! At first, it felt like just another task added to my day.

But, something started shifting. Focus sharpened, ideas flowed more freely, and get this - stress began melting away like ice cream on a hot sidewalk.

Weeks turned into months, and the changes were not subtle; they were monumental. You'd think a superhero had zapped my brain with powers. Work tasks I used to dread now seemed like puzzles waiting to be solved - enjoyment replaced worries.

Creative projects no longer gathered dust in the corners of my imagination but danced vividly before me begging for attention – an unexpected reunion with creativity I never knew I missed so dearly.

Imagine, if you will, a tool so seamlessly integrated into your life, it feels like second nature. Yet, the outcomes are akin to having a personal wizard dedicated to enhancing your cognitive and emotional realms. Users proclaim feeling like they've been given a secret key to unlocking potentials they didn’t know existed within them. The Genius Wave, in essence, is like your personal sherpa guiding you through the mental fog, leading you towards peaks of clarity, energy, and creativity. All this, with just seven minutes a day? It might sound like a fantasy novel subplot, but it’s as real as the benefits users are raving about. Who thought theta waves could be the unsung heroes in our quest for mental wellness and productivity?

**Cons**

Let's delve into the less sparkly side of The Genius Wave, shall we? It's not all brain-boosting sunshine and rainbows. Remember, every silver lining has a cloud or two lurking about.

Limited Availability

Official Website Exclusivity

Stock Warnings Stir Concern

Potential Doubts on Effectiveness

Accessibility Concerns for Some Users

90-Day Money-Back Guarantee Leaves Some Skeptical

Here's the thing—getting your hands on The Genius Wave feels a bit like snagging a ticket to a sold-out concert. It's only available on the official website, which means, if you're the type to browse through different platforms before making a purchase, you're out of luck. Talk about putting all your eggs in one basket.

Then, there's the ominous stock warning. It's like the manufacturer is saying, ""Hurry up, or you'll miss out!""—cue the dramatic music. It stirs up a bit of FOMO, doesn't it? Suddenly, you're not just buying a cognitive enhancement tool; you're racing against an invisible clock.

Accessibility, or shall we say the lack thereof, also raises eyebrows. It's like being part of an exclusive club, but not everyone's invited. If you're not tech-savvy or prefer the good old-fashioned in-store shopping experience, you might feel a bit left out in the cold.

And let's not forget the 90-day money-back guarantee. While it sounds reassuring, it's also the source of some skepticism. It raises the question: If it's so effective, why would I need 90 days to change my mind? It's like going on a date and thinking, ""Well, if it doesn't work out, there's always the return policy.""

So, while The Genius Wave promises to be your brain's best buddy, it's not without its quirks and qualms. Like any relationship, it's a mix of the good, the bad, and the ""hmm, let's think about this.""

Imagine sitting back, eyes closed, headphones on, and letting these carefully crafted soundwaves do their magic. Sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel, right? But here's the kicker – it's all backed by both traditional and modern science. So yes, we're talking real deal benefits: skill improvement, better brain health, you name it.

Now skeptics might raise an eyebrow. A program that can simply make you smarter or more creative just through listening? It begs the question if this is just another marketing initiative wrapped in scientific jargon or truly a revolutionary tool to synchronize your brain for peak performance.

Let’s explore how The Genius Wave stands up to its claims—moving onto delving into the nitty-gritty science behind it all.

**What we like**

Exploring The Genius Wave felt like embarking on a quest to unlock the hidden powers of my mind. Developed by an MIT-trained neuroscientist, this audio program promises a blend of science and magic—think brain power meets wizardry.

Quick Activation of Theta Waves: It's not every day you find something that promises to sync your brain waves with sound waves in just 7 minutes. The idea of activating theta waves for clearer thoughts and improved focus? Sign me up!

Ease of Use—Just Press Play: No gadgets, no wires, no biofeedback machine needed. Just headphones and a digital track that turns any space into your personal lab for brain training—be it your cluttered desk or that cozy coffee shop down the street.

90-Day Money-Back Guarantee: There's comfort in knowing you can take a leap into the world of cognitive enhancement with a safety net. Didn't turn into Einstein? Get your money back—but hey, feeling smarter is pretty much guaranteed.

Free Bonuses to Boost Your Journey: Who doesn’t love extras? Especially when they help solve problems and promote emotional intelligence—and did someone say ""The Secret Behind Activating Money & Wealth""? Yes, please.

Positive Vibes from Customer Reviews: Reading through experiences where folks felt sharper and more creative? It’s like seeing those five-star ratings on your favorite pie recipe online—you know it’s good before even tasting it.

Transformative Effects Beyond Brain Power: Stress relief, deeper learning, even aspirations getting a clarity boost... It's like discovering that the key to Narnia was in your pocket all along but for unlocking your full potential.

Diving into The Genius Wave felt less like a test and more like uncovering secrets of the universe—or at least the ones hidden within our neural pathways. With headphones as my wand and sound waves as my spells, embarking on this journey was akin to stepping into a realm where mental fog dissipates to reveal the bright skyline of cognitive enhancement.

**What we didn’t like**

Diving into The Genius Wave wasn't all smooth sailing. Despite its flashy promises, some parts definitely left us wanting.

Exclusive to the official website - You can't just hop onto Amazon or stroll into your local tech store and grab The Genius Wave. It's locked behind the gates of its official site, making it a tad inconvenient for those of us who love comparing prices or reading reviews on familiar platforms.

Stock issues - Ever tried to get tickets for your favorite band, only to find they're sold out? That's the vibe here. The manufacturer keeps reminding us about ""limited stock,"" which feels more like an annoying marketing tactic than a genuine stock issue.

Awaiting results can test patience - Imagine staring at seeds in a pot and waiting for them to sprout — that’s kind of what waiting for results felt like. They said ""give it time,"" but how much time does one need to possibly see their genius visualization come to life?No quick fix – Sure, syncing up to theta states sounds exciting until you realize it's not an instant switch for creativity or problem-solving magic; it’s more about setting the mood than directly boosting brainpower 

**The Science Behind The Genius Wave**

Dive into the world where soundwaves meet brainwaves, creating a cocktail of cognitive superpowers. It's like your mind is on a spa day, every day, thanks to The Genius Wave and its groundbreaking science.

**How The Genius Wave Works**

The Genius Wave kicks into gear when you hit play, diving straight into the science of soundwaves. These aren't your average tunes; they're meticulously crafted by neuroscientists to tap directly into your brain's Theta waves.

Picture it — just by listening, you're sending a VIP invitation to enhance your cognitive skills, emotional intelligence, and even physical health. This method doesn’t just skim the surface like scrolling through endless self-help videos online; it dives deep to root out cognitive hitches by restoring those all-important theta waves.

Imagine donning headphones and being enveloped in sounds that could have been curated by a DJ from the future – except this DJ wants to crank up your brainpower, not just make you dance.

It’s like giving your mind a workout without lifting a single weight or solving complex math problems. In just 7 minutes a day - less time than it takes to brew coffee - The Genius Wave sets its sights on elevating everything from concentration and creativity to stress relief and sleep quality.

All aboard for an auditory journey designed not only for tranquil moments of meditation but for powering through life with enhanced perception and zest!

**The Power of Soundwaves in Enhancing Cognitive Abilities**

Understanding how The Genius Wave operates opens the door to exploring the magic of soundwaves on cognitive functions. These waves tune into the brain’s natural rhythms, nudging it towards greater harmony and efficiency.

Sound has this uncanny ability to influence our mental state, encouraging theta wave activation for a boost in creativity, focus, and clarity. Imagine sitting back, closing your eyes, and letting these tones recalibrate your mind's inner workings.

Soundwaves don't just hit play on a better mood; they work hard behind the scenes. They engage with our brains on a level that fosters relaxation while sharpening memory retention and decision-making skills.

The Genius Wave: A 90-Day Test

I dove into The Genius Wave for a wild 90-day ride, expecting to emerge as the next Einstein—spoiler alert, I didn’t—but boy, was it an adventure. Every day felt like a mix of science experiment and personal quest, with my brain on the line; talk about high stakes!

**Testing Procedure and Routine**

Testing The Genius Wave kicked off with an ambitious goal. Aimed to see if this could really be the game-changer for cognitive abilities, a strict routine was set. Here's how it all went down:

# 

Mark your calendar! Every day, like clockwork, set aside time - precisely 7 minutes after breakfast. Why after breakfast? Well, who doesn't enjoy a side of brainwaves with their morning coffee?

Get comfy - Find that sweet spot in your home where the noise of the outside world fades away. For me, it was the cozy corner by the window, bathed in sunlight and away from the hustle.

Wear headphones - Yes, those fancy ones you only use for special occasions. It turns out soundwave entrainment needs crisp, clear sound to work its magic on your brain.

Close those peepers - Shutting your eyes helps shut out the world. With just you and The Genius Wave, it's less about seeing and more about feeling.

Focus on breathing - Deep breaths in and out set the stage for relaxation and open-mindedness toward the sounds you’re about to hear.

Hit play – This is where you dive into The Genius Wave’s world: seven minutes of sound designed to kickstart your brain into a state of heightened awareness and creativity.

Reflection time – After each session, jot down any changes in mindset or sudden bursts of inspiration on paper (or whatever digital note-taking app you prefer). Noticing patterns over time can be quite enlightening!

Rinse and repeat – Same time, same place, every day for 90 days straight without skipping a beat... or a wave in this case.

Weekly wrap - up sessions included reviewing notes taken throughout the week to identify any significant shifts in anxiety levels, focus, energy levels... or lack thereof.

Pairing with physical exercise – Three times a week, I combined my listening sessions with light jogging or yoga to test if movement encouraged stronger effects; mind-body connection was the buzzword here.

Sharing experiences – Once a week discussions with other testers provided insights into their journeys and added motivation to stick with it even when skepticism tried to creep in.

Final assessment involved comparing notes from Day 1 to Day 90; looking for improvements in mental well-being, creative thinking ability, learning processes enhancements, and yes… whether it made financial planning feel less like navigating through a stormy sea.

The journey had its ups and downs but followed these steps faithfully promised an adventure—a quest towards unlocking potential hidden within waves… sound waves that is!

Diving into The Genius Wave felt like hopping on a rollercoaster—exciting, a bit terrifying, and loaded with ups and downs.

Pros

Embarking on the journey with The Genius Wave feels like stumbling upon a hidden oasis in the desert of daily stress and cognitive overload. Picture this: activating theta waves for a lush garden of cognitive and emotional prosperity—yes, it promises that and delivers in spades. Let’s paint a picture of the myriad benefits that sprout from embedding The Genius Wave into your daily routine.

Users proclaim feeling like they've been given a secret key to unlocking potentials they didn’t know existed within them. The Genius Wave, in essence, is like your personal sherpa guiding you through the mental fog, leading you towards peaks of clarity, energy, and creativity. All this, with just seven minutes a day? It might sound like a fantasy novel subplot, but it’s as real as the benefits users are raving about. Who thought theta waves could be the unsung heroes in our quest for mental wellness and productivity?

**Cons**

Let's delve into the less sparkly side of The Genius Wave, shall we? It's not all brain-boosting sunshine and rainbows. Remember, every silver lining has a cloud or two lurking about.

Limited Availability

Official Website Exclusivity

Stock Warnings Stir Concern

Potential Doubts on Effectiveness

Accessibility Concerns for Some Users

90-Day Money-Back Guarantee Leaves Some Skeptical

Here's the thing—getting your hands on The Genius Wave feels a bit like snagging a ticket to a sold-out concert. It's only available on the official website, which means, if you're the type to browse through different platforms before making a purchase, you're out of luck. Talk about putting all your eggs in one basket.

Then, there's the ominous stock warning. It's like the manufacturer is saying, ""Hurry up, or you'll miss out!""—cue the dramatic music. It stirs up a bit of FOMO, doesn't it? Suddenly, you're not just buying a cognitive enhancement tool; you're racing against an invisible clock.

Accessibility, or shall we say the lack thereof, also raises eyebrows. It's like being part of an exclusive club, but not everyone's invited. If you're not tech-savvy or prefer the good old-fashioned in-store shopping experience, you might feel a bit left out in the cold.

And let's not forget the 90-day money-back guarantee. While it sounds reassuring, it's also the source of some skepticism. It raises the question: If it's so effective, why would I need 90 days to change my mind? It's like going on a date and thinking, ""Well, if it doesn't work out, there's always the return policy.""

So, while The Genius Wave promises to be your brain's best buddy, it's not without its quirks and qualms. Like any relationship, it's a mix of the good, the bad, and the ""hmm, let's think about this.""

But here's the kicker – it's all backed by both traditional and modern science. So yes, we're talking real deal benefits: skill improvement, better brain health, you name it.

Now skeptics might raise an eyebrow. A program that can simply make you smarter or more creative just through listening? It begs the question if this is just another marketing initiative wrapped in scientific jargon or truly a revolutionary tool to synchronize your brain for peak performance.

Let’s explore how The Genius Wave stands up to its claims—moving onto delving into the nitty-gritty science behind it all.

**What we like**

Exploring The Genius Wave felt like embarking on a quest to unlock the hidden powers of my mind. Developed by an MIT-trained neuroscientist, this audio program promises a blend of science and magic—think brain power meets wizardry.

**What we didn’t like**

Diving into The Genius Wave wasn't all smooth sailing. Despite its flashy promises, some parts definitely left us wanting.

Exclusive to the official website - You can't just hop onto Amazon or stroll into your local tech store and grab The Genius Wave. It's locked behind the gates of its official site, making it a tad inconvenient for those of us who love comparing prices or reading reviews on familiar platforms.

Stock issues - Ever tried to get tickets for your favorite band, only to find they're sold out? That's the vibe here. The manufacturer keeps reminding us about ""limited stock,"" which feels more like an annoying marketing tactic than a genuine stock issue.

Awaiting results can test patience - Imagine staring at seeds in a pot and waiting for them to sprout — that’s kind of what waiting for results felt like. They said ""give it time,"" but how much time does one need to possibly see their genius visualization come to life?No quick fix – Sure, syncing up to theta states sounds exciting until you realize it's not an instant switch for creativity or problem-solving magic; it’s more about setting the mood than directly boosting brainpower 

**The Science Behind The Genius Wave**

Dive into the world where soundwaves meet brainwaves, creating a cocktail of cognitive superpowers. It's like your mind is on a spa day, every day, thanks to The Genius Wave and its groundbreaking science.

**How The Genius Wave Works**

The Genius Wave kicks into gear when you hit play, diving straight into the science of soundwaves. These aren't your average tunes; they're meticulously crafted by neuroscientists to tap directly into your brain's Theta waves.

Picture it — just by listening, you're sending a VIP invitation to enhance your cognitive skills, emotional intelligence, and even physical health. This method doesn’t just skim the surface like scrolling through endless self-help videos online; it dives deep to root out cognitive hitches by restoring those all-important theta waves.

Imagine donning headphones and being enveloped in sounds that could have been curated by a DJ from the future – except this DJ wants to crank up your brainpower, not just make you dance.

It’s like giving your mind a workout without lifting a single weight or solving complex math problems. In just 7 minutes a day - less time than it takes to brew coffee - The Genius Wave sets its sights on elevating everything from concentration and creativity to stress relief and sleep quality.

All aboard for an auditory journey designed not only for tranquil moments of meditation but for powering through life with enhanced perception and zest!

Sound has this uncanny ability to influence our mental state, encouraging theta wave activation for a boost in creativity, focus, and clarity. Imagine sitting back, closing your eyes, and letting these tones recalibrate your mind's inner workings.

Soundwaves don't just hit play on a better mood; they work hard behind the scenes. They engage with our brains on a level that fosters relaxation while sharpening memory retention and decision-making skills.

The Genius Wave: A 90-Day Test

I dove into The Genius Wave for a wild 90-day ride, expecting to emerge as the next Einstein—spoiler alert, I didn’t—but boy, was it an adventure. Every day felt like a mix of science experiment and personal quest, with my brain on the line; talk about high stakes!

**Testing Procedure and Routine**

Testing The Genius Wave kicked off with an ambitious goal. Aimed to see if this could really be the game-changer for cognitive abilities, a strict routine was set. Here's how it all went down:

# 

Mark your calendar! Every day, like clockwork, set aside time - precisely 7 minutes after breakfast. Why after breakfast? Well, who doesn't enjoy a side of brainwaves with their morning coffee?

Get comfy - Find that sweet spot in your home where the noise of the outside world fades away. For me, it was the cozy corner by the window, bathed in sunlight and away from the hustle.

Wear headphones - Yes, those fancy ones you only use for special occasions. It turns out soundwave entrainment needs crisp, clear sound to work its magic on your brain.

Close those peepers - Shutting your eyes helps shut out the world. With just you and The Genius Wave, it's less about seeing and more about feeling.

Focus on breathing - Deep breaths in and out set the stage for relaxation and open-mindedness toward the sounds you’re about to hear.

Hit play – This is where you dive into The Genius Wave’s world: seven minutes of sound designed to kickstart your brain into a state of heightened awareness and creativity.

Reflection time – After each session, jot down any changes in mindset or sudden bursts of inspiration on paper (or whatever digital note-taking app you prefer). Noticing patterns over time can be quite enlightening!

Rinse and repeat – Same time, same place, every day for 90 days straight without skipping a beat... or a wave in this case.

Weekly wrap - up sessions included reviewing notes taken throughout the week to identify any significant shifts in anxiety levels, focus, energy levels... or lack thereof.

Pairing with physical exercise – Three times a week, I combined my listening sessions with light jogging or yoga to test if movement encouraged stronger effects; mind-body connection was the buzzword here.

Sharing experiences – Once a week discussions with other testers provided insights into their journeys and added motivation to stick with it even when skepticism tried to creep in.

Final assessment involved comparing notes from Day 1 to Day 90; looking for improvements in mental well-being, creative thinking ability, learning processes enhancements, and yes… whether it made financial planning feel less like navigating through a stormy sea.

The journey had its ups and downs but followed these steps faithfully promised an adventure—a quest towards unlocking potential hidden within waves… sound waves that is!

Personal Experience and Observations

I gave The Genius Wave a shot, skeptical but hopeful. My routine? Seven minutes every day, in the quietest corner of my house. Imagine that - just seven minutes! At first, it felt like just another task added to my day.

But, something started shifting. Focus sharpened, ideas flowed more freely, and get this - stress began melting away like ice cream on a hot sidewalk.

Weeks turned into months, and the changes were not subtle; they were monumental. You'd think a superhero had zapped my brain with powers. Work tasks I used to dread now seemed like puzzles waiting to be solved - enjoyment replaced worries.

Creative projects no longer gathered dust in the corners of my imagination but danced vividly before me begging for attention – an unexpected reunion with creativity I never knew I missed so dearly.

Accessibility, or shall we say the lack thereof, also raises eyebrows. It's like being part of an exclusive club, but not everyone's invited. If you're not tech-savvy or prefer the good old-fashioned in-store shopping experience, you might feel a bit left out in the cold.

And let's not forget the 90-day money-back guarantee. While it sounds reassuring, it's also the source of some skepticism. It raises the question: If it's so effective, why would I need 90 days to change my mind? It's like going on a date and thinking, ""Well, if it doesn't work out, there's always the return policy.""

**Testing Procedure and Routine**

Testing The Genius Wave kicked off with an ambitious goal. Aimed to see if this could really be the game-changer for cognitive abilities, a strict routine was set. Here's how it all went down:

# 

Mark your calendar! Every day, like clockwork, set aside time - precisely 7 minutes after breakfast. Why after breakfast? Well, who doesn't enjoy a side of brainwaves with their morning coffee?

Get comfy - Find that sweet spot in your home where the noise of the outside world fades away. For me, it was the cozy corner by the window, bathed in sunlight and away from the hustle.

Wear headphones - Yes, those fancy ones you only use for special occasions. It turns out soundwave entrainment needs crisp, clear sound to work its magic on your brain.

Close those peepers - Shutting your eyes helps shut out the world. With just you and The Genius Wave, it's less about seeing and more about feeling.

Focus on breathing - Deep breaths in and out set the stage for relaxation and open-mindedness toward the sounds you’re about to hear.

Hit play – This is where you dive into The Genius Wave’s world: seven minutes of sound designed to kickstart your brain into a state of heightened awareness and creativity.

Reflection time – After each session, jot down any changes in mindset or sudden bursts of inspiration on paper (or whatever digital note-taking app you prefer). Noticing patterns over time can be quite enlightening!

Rinse and repeat – Same time, same place, every day for 90 days straight without skipping a beat... or a wave in this case.

Weekly wrap - up sessions included reviewing notes taken throughout the week to identify any significant shifts in anxiety levels, focus, energy levels... or lack thereof.

Pairing with physical exercise – Three times a week, I combined my listening sessions with light jogging or yoga to test if movement encouraged stronger effects; mind-body connection was the buzzword here.

Sharing experiences – Once a week discussions with other testers provided insights into their journeys and added motivation to stick with it even when skepticism tried to creep in.

Final assessment involved comparing notes from Day 1 to Day 90; looking for improvements in mental well-being, creative thinking ability, learning processes enhancements, and yes… whether it made financial planning feel less like navigating through a stormy sea.

The journey had its ups and downs but followed these steps faithfully promised an adventure—a quest towards unlocking potential hidden within waves… sound waves that is!

Personal Experience and Observations

I gave The Genius Wave a shot, skeptical but hopeful. My routine? Seven minutes every day, in the quietest corner of my house. Imagine that - just seven minutes! At first, it felt like just another task added to my day.

But, something started shifting. Focus sharpened, ideas flowed more freely, and get this - stress began melting away like ice cream on a hot sidewalk.

Weeks turned into months, and the changes were not subtle; they were monumental. You'd think a superhero had zapped my brain with powers. Work tasks I used to dread now seemed like puzzles waiting to be solved - enjoyment replaced worries.

Creative projects no longer gathered dust in the corners of my imagination but danced vividly before me begging for attention – an unexpected reunion with creativity I never knew I missed so dearly.

**How The Genius Wave Works**

The Genius Wave kicks into gear when you hit play, diving straight into the science of soundwaves. These aren't your average tunes; they're meticulously crafted by neuroscientists to tap directly into your brain's Theta waves.

Picture it — just by listening, you're sending a VIP invitation to enhance your cognitive skills, emotional intelligence, and even physical health. This method doesn’t just skim the surface like scrolling through endless self-help videos online; it dives deep to root out cognitive hitches by restoring those all-important theta waves.

Imagine donning headphones and being enveloped in sounds that could have been curated by a DJ from the future – except this DJ wants to crank up your brainpower, not just make you dance.

It’s like giving your mind a workout without lifting a single weight or solving complex math problems. In just 7 minutes a day - less time than it takes to brew coffee - The Genius Wave sets its sights on elevating everything from concentration and creativity to stress relief and sleep quality.

All aboard for an auditory journey designed not only for tranquil moments of meditation but for powering through life with enhanced perception and zest!

**The Power of Soundwaves in Enhancing Cognitive Abilities**

Understanding how The Genius Wave operates opens the door to exploring the magic of soundwaves on cognitive functions. These waves tune into the brain’s natural rhythms, nudging it towards greater harmony and efficiency.

Sound has this uncanny ability to influence our mental state, encouraging theta wave activation for a boost in creativity, focus, and clarity. Imagine sitting back, closing your eyes, and letting these tones recalibrate your mind's inner workings.

Soundwaves don't just hit play on a better mood; they work hard behind the scenes. They engage with our brains on a level that fosters relaxation while sharpening memory retention and decision-making skills.

Users feel their anxieties soften as confidence takes stage—all thanks to carefully crafted auditory experiences designed to match human mind's intricate frequencies. This sonic adventure doesn’t stop at stress relief; it powers through enhancing interpersonal relationships by fostering clear communication skills, emboldening users to create their ideal future with unmistakable confidence and prowess.

The Genius Wave: A 90-Day Test

I dove into The Genius Wave for a wild 90-day ride, expecting to emerge as the next Einstein—spoiler alert, I didn’t—but boy, was it an adventure. Every day felt like a mix of science experiment and personal quest, with my brain on the line; talk about high stakes!

**Testing Procedure and Routine**

Testing The Genius Wave kicked off with an ambitious goal. Aimed to see if this could really be the game-changer for cognitive abilities, a strict routine was set. Here's how it all went down:

# 

Mark your calendar! Every day, like clockwork, set aside time - precisely 7 minutes after breakfast. Why after breakfast? Well, who doesn't enjoy a side of brainwaves with their morning coffee?

Get comfy - Find that sweet spot in your home where the noise of the outside world fades away. For me, it was the cozy corner by the window, bathed in sunlight and away from the hustle.

Wear headphones - Yes, those fancy ones you only use for special occasions. It turns out soundwave entrainment needs crisp, clear sound to work its magic on your brain.

Close those peepers - Shutting your eyes helps shut out the world. With just you and The Genius Wave, it's less about seeing and more about feeling.

Focus on breathing - Deep breaths in and out set the stage for relaxation and open-mindedness toward the sounds you’re about to hear.

Hit play – This is where you dive into The Genius Wave’s world: seven minutes of sound designed to kickstart your brain into a state of heightened awareness and creativity.

Reflection time – After each session, jot down any changes in mindset or sudden bursts of inspiration on paper (or whatever digital note-taking app you prefer). Noticing patterns over time can be quite enlightening!

Rinse and repeat – Same time, same place, every day for 90 days straight without skipping a beat... or a wave in this case.

Weekly wrap - up sessions included reviewing notes taken throughout the week to identify any significant shifts in anxiety levels, focus, energy levels... or lack thereof.

Pairing with physical exercise – Three times a week, I combined my listening sessions with light jogging or yoga to test if movement encouraged stronger effects; mind-body connection was the buzzword here.

Sharing experiences – Once a week discussions with other testers provided insights into their journeys and added motivation to stick with it even when skepticism tried to creep in.

Final assessment involved comparing notes from Day 1 to Day 90; looking for improvements in mental well-being, creative thinking ability, learning processes enhancements, and yes… whether it made financial planning feel less like navigating through a stormy sea.

The journey had its ups and downs but followed these steps faithfully promised an adventure—a quest towards unlocking potential hidden within waves… sound waves that is!

Personal Experience and Observations

I gave The Genius Wave a shot, skeptical but hopeful. My routine? Seven minutes every day, in the quietest corner of my house. Imagine that - just seven minutes! At first, it felt like just another task added to my day.

But, something started shifting. Focus sharpened, ideas flowed more freely, and get this - stress began melting away like ice cream on a hot sidewalk.

Weeks turned into months, and the changes were not subtle; they were monumental. You'd think a superhero had zapped my brain with powers. Work tasks I used to dread now seemed like puzzles waiting to be solved - enjoyment replaced worries.

Creative projects no longer gathered dust in the corners of my imagination but danced vividly before me begging for attention – an unexpected reunion with creativity I never knew I missed so dearly.

The Genius Wave: Pros and Cons

Imagine, if you will, a tool so seamlessly integrated into your life, it feels like second nature. Yet, the outcomes are akin to having a personal wizard dedicated to enhancing your cognitive and emotional realms. Users proclaim feeling like they've been given a secret key to unlocking potentials they didn’t know existed within them. The Genius Wave, in essence, is like your personal sherpa guiding you through the mental fog, leading you towards peaks of clarity, energy, and creativity. All this, with just seven minutes a day? It might sound like a fantasy novel subplot, but it’s as real as the benefits users are raving about. Who thought theta waves could be the unsung heroes in our quest for mental wellness and productivity?

**Cons**

Let's delve into the less sparkly side of The Genius Wave, shall we? It's not all brain-boosting sunshine and rainbows. Remember, every silver lining has a cloud or two lurking about.

Limited Availability

Official Website Exclusivity

Stock Warnings Stir Concern

Potential Doubts on Effectiveness

Accessibility Concerns for Some Users

90-Day Money-Back Guarantee Leaves Some Skeptical

Here's the thing—getting your hands on The Genius Wave feels a bit like snagging a ticket to a sold-out concert. It's only available on the official website, which means, if you're the type to browse through different platforms before making a purchase, you're out of luck. Talk about putting all your eggs in one basket.

Then, there's the ominous stock warning. It's like the manufacturer is saying, ""Hurry up, or you'll miss out!""—cue the dramatic music. It stirs up a bit of FOMO, doesn't it? Suddenly, you're not just buying a cognitive enhancement tool; you're racing against an invisible clock.

Accessibility, or shall we say the lack thereof, also raises eyebrows. It's like being part of an exclusive club, but not everyone's invited. If you're not tech-savvy or prefer the good old-fashioned in-store shopping experience, you might feel a bit left out in the cold.

And let's not forget the 90-day money-back guarantee. While it sounds reassuring, it's also the source of some skepticism. It raises the question: If it's so effective, why would I need 90 days to change my mind? It's like going on a date and thinking, ""Well, if it doesn't work out, there's always the return policy.""

So, while The Genius Wave promises to be your brain's best buddy, it's not without its quirks and qualms. Like any relationship, it's a mix of the good, the bad, and the ""hmm, let's think about this.""

I don't think i'm addicted but i just feel off and tired if i don't drink multiple cups of coffee throughout the day and especially in the morning.
a few days ago i was super anxious because of school and i think i drank 9 cups of black coffee and it made me feel like shit for 2 days straight. i felt so nauseous and i had the worst headache imaginable.i realized that that happens whenever i drink coffee
so yesterday i searched it up and found that its an addition. this might sound stupid but i thought coffee was good for us

my question is how do you feel after quitting? what do you drink in the morning to wake up? why is caffeine even considered an addiction? and do i have to stop drinking coffee completely or just drink it in a moderate amount?

Anyhoo, has anyone asked about paying daily for the vehicles? If I put myself in lyft's place I'd say it's better to get all 7 days before drivers get a dime to ensure it's gotten. 

Fair enough. I'm sure plenty of drivers screwed them somehow so to be fair they're not in business to lose money. 

But paying one day at a time wouldn't require much more computer power to keep up on. Maybe a few more lines on a page, tougher to check on errors by hand. Whatever. What it would do is allow drivers to have money in hand daily for charging or gas, breaks, coffee. 

But most of all it would take away that feeling that were busting our ass 3/4 days straight and getting zero at the end of it. I'd be sure to stay out more if I got paid to do it.

1fv1qkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/1fv1qkl/type_me_based_on_the_questions_that_are_pinned_on/,Type me based on the questions that are pinned on the board!,"Hi! So I’ve been unsure about my mbti Type for a while and I was kind looking for some answers? I’ve typed myself as Istp, Estp, Estj, and Entj before, all which are thinkers but based on my answers here I’m starting to think I have a little more feels in my bones.

If the answers are confusing, I’m very sorry! They said to elaborate and when I elaborate I tend to get off topic or ramble, this is just me trying to answer it as genuinely as I can. I’m super interested to hear some interpretations! If you need some clarification I’ll gladly answer your questions :)))

Here it is

• How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

Hi! I’m 18, male, he/him. I like to keep it simple, but to elaborate, I wear a lot of streetwear because it's comfortable and stylish. I often pair it with graphic tees to stand out. The baggy look works well for almost anyone. I also wear zip-up hoodies frequently—my favorite is a grey one from Forever 21. It goes with any outfit and is practical since I can easily take it on and off. So, I'd say I dress mainly for comfort, style, and practicality.

• Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 10, but that’s it.

• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

Growing up, I moved around a lot, which had a big impact on me. I struggled to fit in, dealt with strict parenting, and faced academic challenges. As a kid, I constantly changed my personality to fit in, which left me confused about my true self. I sought social validation and wanted to be seen as ""the smart one,"" but I often felt insecure and struggled with tests.

In middle school, I made online friends, which felt easier than trying to fit in at school. I began questioning why I felt the need to always put on an act. While I was still adjusting my personality, I eventually started to feel more comfortable with myself.

High school was mixed for me. During the pandemic, I was lazy but stayed connected online. By graduation, I had become more open and social. I realized people genuinely liked me for who I was, which helped me embrace my true self. Now, I'm much more comfortable and social.

• What do you do as a job or career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I’m a college student and don’t have a job just yet.

• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

If I had to spend the weekend alone physically, I'd watch a lot of shows and draw since it's one of my hobbies. I'd feel refreshed and relaxed. I think being away from people helps me feel free. However, I would feel uncomfortable if I couldn’t talk to anyone at all. I like discussing things, sharing ideas, and gaining new perspectives, which I find refreshing and insightful. I enjoy sharing things I find interesting and bonding over them.

• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

It’s a mix of both. I enjoy going for walks while listening to music or exploring the area to try new foods when I can. I don’t drive yet, but I’d love to drive around and visit places with friends once I can. Indoors, I enjoy drawing and playing games. Games keep me focused, and I can concentrate on drawing if I have something playing in the background, like a podcast or music. As for sports, I never really committed to any because they made me feel bored or stressed, but I’m slightly better than average at volleyball.

• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about—is it environmental or conceptual?

I’m not very curious, but I like deep dives into topics that interest me. My ideas often help me understand concepts better. For instance, the idea that gravity is like a trampoline helped me visualize and grasp it: the surface bends and pulls towards the center.

I've also developed thoughts about people's behaviors that help me decide who I want to interact with or avoid. In general, I'm interested in how things function, and I enjoy breaking down concepts to understand things that confuse me. Most of my ideas are to help me learn or do things faster so I can understand them. I tend to notice patterns and make connections.

I enjoy learning about:

Physics: Even though I wasn't great at it, I loved understanding how the concepts fit together.
People: Observing behavioral patterns helps me understand others better. I also enjoy watching deep dives into social dynamics.
Art: I like understanding which color combinations maximize vibrancy and how to design compelling characters.
• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

I prefer working alone but wouldn't mind joining a group of competent people. If I had to lead, I think I’d be good at breaking tasks down and explaining why they’re important to motivate others. If someone’s work isn’t up to my standards, I’d offer feedback or suggest adjustments—and then ask if they agree. I don’t enjoy leading, but I do like seeing tasks get done. In group dynamics, I prefer being assigned a task and doing my best while interacting with teammates if needed. If things aren’t up to par, I tend to step in and offer suggestions. I think collaboration only works well if everyone knows what they're doing.

• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art. If not, describe what forms of art you appreciate.

Yes, I mostly do digital art. My style is cartoony and stylized, focusing on character illustration and design. I create a lot of original characters for shows I like and sometimes give them backstories to fit into those worlds. My favorite part is working on facial expressions and poses to capture each character's personality.

• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

For me, the present and future are what matter most. You can't change the past, but you can shape the future. Mistakes can’t be undone, but they can be learned from. I focus mainly on the present—what I can do right now to make up for the past or to feel good while keeping the future in mind.

• How do you act when others request your help? If you decide to help them, why would you?

I try my best to help if I can, especially for friends or people I like. If it’s someone I dislike, I often make excuses not to help, like saying, ""Oh, ____ is better at this than me; ask them."" I don’t help people who give me a bad impression, but if I see potential in them as a kind, interesting person, I become enthusiastic and curious.

• Do you need logical consistency in your life?

Not really. Life isn't always about making the right decisions; it’s about making the decisions you want, as long as they’re ethical. You can’t just make decisions based solely on facts—people’s emotions are facts too. Of course, there’s a limit, as you can’t be too unreasonable. I like doing things I enjoy, even if they don’t benefit me long-term, as long as they don’t hurt anyone.

• How important are efficiency and productivity to you?

Efficiency matters to me only when I want to get things done quickly so I can return to whatever I was doing. It's not always important, but it is when solving a problem that’s preventing me from doing what I want.

• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

Not really. I only try to control others when they’re bothering me by telling them off a little, like saying, ""Okay… that’s a little weird; maybe don’t do that."" It’s more of a suggestion, but it tends to set them straight. Otherwise, I let people be, as long as they don’t bother me.

• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

I collect art books to support my favorite artists and because I enjoy having collections of artwork. I also collect some manga and art guides to understand different thought processes. Aside from that, I love judging movies—if they have an impact on me, if the message was well-delivered, and if the writing is strong. I also like trying new foods and have a goal to try all the coffee shops around my area. I enjoy creating characters with backstories because I love compelling characters in media, especially specific tropes. Lastly, I enjoy PvE combat games and collecting items to decorate my room.

• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

I like breaking things down into their smallest components and understanding how they fit into the bigger picture. I ask a lot of questions to get clarification, which can be annoying to some, but it helps me learn. Repetition is key for me to retain information.

• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks, or do you wing it?

I tend to wing projects. I do each part as best I can and see where it goes, sometimes asking for opinions along the way. I enjoy improvising.

• What are your aspirations in life, both professionally and personally?

I’d love to have a stable job that doesn’t take up too much time—ideally remote so I can work from anywhere—and maybe travel the world. Or just get rich.

• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

I’m not really afraid of much, but I do fear not being good enough for people and being rejected. It makes me feel worthless.

• What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

The highs are when I gain some sort of accomplishment or achieve what I set out to do.

• What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

The lows are when I find myself overwhelmed by my emotions due to something embarrassing that I can't get out of my head, and I end up beating myself up over it.

• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

I’m pretty attached to reality, especially when something fun is happening. However, when I’m bored, I tend to space out, but I can easily snap out of it if someone calls my name.

• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

If I were in a blank, empty room, my first thought would be figuring out how to get out. I'd probably start trying to kick the walls or look for some way out.

• How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

I tend to procrastinate until the last minute, at which point I make a definitive decision and stick with it because I convince myself that I can't change it at that point.

• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

Emotions are important, and I am affected by them quite a bit. However, I try to make a conscious effort not to let my emotions directly influence my actions. For instance, if someone makes me angry, especially if I have to see them daily, I try to understand and remind myself that it's not my problem. But I do need to express those emotions to someone else before I can let go of the anger.

I tell myself to stay objective and that there are more important things to focus on than being angry and cursing someone in my head. Usually, I talk to my friends or find a distraction to help. Still, internally, I might feel angry and want to yell, but I know better than to actually do that.

• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

I often agree with people just to appease them if I see that arguing isn’t worth it or won’t go anywhere. I let go of my own logic in those moments, realizing that it’s just a waste of time.

• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or do you believe they know better? If you do break rules, why?

I generally follow rules but dislike bad ones. Authority figures should know better than to create unnecessary or harmful rules. If there are bad rules, I’d encourage others to break them, though I’d try to stay out of trouble myself. However, I would break the rules if I knew I was in the right, especially if there were others with me.

So let’s make some friends maybe. A bit about me, I’m a certified personal trainer. I’m a full time coach for my workout program movewell on the join ladder app if anyone is familiar. I was born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Met my now husband while attending  Michigan State University. Moved to Austin Texas 5 years ago but we still spend plenty of time in mich. We don’t have any kids. Just our fur babies.

I also work on social media. I do running content. So not only am I helping with workout ideas and routines, I also review running outfits. A lot of companies send things in for me to try so I’m never short on any running / workout outfits. I’ve been sober for the past month, have not had any alcoholic beverages. Been drinking other substitutes that are non alcoholic beverages but still taste a bit similar! I like coffee, getting coffee is my favorite thing to do in the morning.

Anyone else from the Austin Texas area or maybe from Michigan? There’s a good chance someone might even actually know me on here from my brief description. Do let me know if anyone does know, that would be pretty cool. Small world moment.

Username is totally unrelated to my name btw. There was a character in book that I read and his name was King Casey so I took inspiration from that.

1fv1lzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/cdifficile/comments/1fv1lzv/constant_reoccurring_cdiff/,CONSTANT Reoccurring cdiff,"Hey guys I could really use some advice or help because at this point i’m truly desperate. 

 My first ever symptoms started I want to say around October 2023. I kept having diarrhea and had the worst pain imaginable on my lower abdomen, I was loosing weight like severely (I lost about 52lbs) I’ve been told I have an ulcer in my stomach that has burned through the lining, however  this pain was different at the time they had no Idea what it was and wrote it off as unknown abdominal pain. Every time I’d be laughed at in the ER or be told I had Munchausen due to how frequently I was coming in. That was until I went to my phlebotomy training in Dec and threw up what looked like coffee grounds then passed out in the bathroom. I felt so sick like I was going to d*e until they checked my vitals injec. sights and knew it was something worse they said I was pale and that by heart rate was very very high (normally mines resting  at 58 bpm) well they sent me straight to the ER where they treated me better but mentioned it could possibly be cdiff but said that I did have an ulcer and it was probably just that gave me famotidine and a nausea med. 
In February I started to  and told them that the other ER suspected my pain to be something serious (at the time i didn’t remember the whole mention of cdiff) where they again laughed at me and then saw on ct scans that my appendix was about to burst weirdly my kidneys and liver were also having off results. Well they told me I needed to see a gastroenterologist due to the severity and of course I didn’t have insurance for any of this. Well I went to a gastroenterologist just for her to talk to me 5 mins (not about any med issues) and just sent me to the lab to go buy a fecal test. I did the test and the results came back positive with Cdiff. Finally I knew what the issue was. 

The biggest struggle for me (not knowing for years that I had cdiff) is that at 18 I weighed healthily at 138lbs now i’m lucky if I can even see 85-90lbs the lowest I dropped was to 70lbs and the doctors all assumed it was anorexia but in reality I couldn’t even get an appetite let alone stomach the food I’d force myself to eat because of whatever it is that keeps causing the cdiff. Mind you i’m in my early 20s, DONT take any meds besides occasional ibuprofen, or famotadine and DO NOT take antibiotics ooorrr eat after using the bathroom. I have bad OCD with cleaning and it causes me to wash my hands 2 in a row and I shower every other day so I know i’m not like dirty if you know what I mean. Realistically from doctors pov I shouldn’t be getting this but they don’t know why I am. 

After getting it the second time I got treated after spending about 1k on vancomycin :/ and then got it again in July took more medication this time I got insurance thank god. And made sure to act as if every time I used the bathroom the toilet and my hands had the plague so i’d wash my hands spray the toilet with bleach and all surfaces that could have been in contact and wash my hands again. But then shit hit the fan reaaaalll quick because my toilet stopped working so my roommate and I are stuck using the same toilet (still clean it the same). Well now he got it im not sure even how! And then I got it again for the 4th time in August 31st. It gets worse. My roommate keeps getting denied for insurance even though he doesn’t even make enough but that’s a whole different situation. Annnd he has kidney stones so he’s sicker than I even am and in so soooo much pain (he also works 72hrs a week yes i have proof 72 freaking hrs A WEEK and is just not ok health wise annnnd only gets 1 day off if that!) Well he can’t afford to buy the medication so both of us were just stuck dealing until september came and I had to go to seattle. I had a doctor explain that I could literally kill someone if I gave it to them which really scared me. So he gave me meds and suspects I could have colitis and that’s what’s causing my reoccurring symptoms. Well I take the meds and go to seattle to come back home to BOTH yes BOTH CATS having diarrhea and vomiting symptoms. The vets also laughed and said it was impossible for a cat to contract Cdiff due to human to feline contact well sure enough I paid about 1k for the cats to be tested with EVERYTHING just to be told they also have cdiff and meds were $200. Sadly we couldn’t afford annnyy of this and only got one of our cats meds she’s the only one in the house without it and this breaks my heart but she’s in my room all day alone because i’m scared to get her sick again (our other cat has it but was and is more healthy than she was she was about to die) and now the three of us still have it and are all literally just dying I really don’t know what to do part of me feels like the bacteria grew throughout the house cause the cats use the litter box then walk on the floor jump on the couch god I’m just so stressed thinking about it I feel like everything Is just filled with Cdiff bacteria and I don’t know what to do or how to stop getting It i should be living like a normal adult but instead i’m literally staying home and can’t even have a job due to how bad the symptoms are and needing to always take time off of work due to health issues and not wanting to literally kill others. Please any and all advice would be appreciated it’s been hard not to get depressed I feel so stuck and disgusting. I just want it to go away permanently and for my roommate to be Ok…",1,1727937547.0,cdifficile,1,1.0,False
1fv1lxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fv1lxr/aita_for_maybe_destroying_his_life/,AITA for (maybe) destroying his life,"Hello, I'm 23M and my ex jake (fake name) is 35M. We met through a dating app. During our second date, he asked me if i wanna be his bf. Me being excited since i never got into any relationship i said yes (will be my biggest regret) even though he's not fully my type. He told me in the second date that he has a wife still i said yes without thinking abt any consequence that it might cause.

The first few weeks were nice actually bcs i've never felt special in my life. He treated me quite well, like any other loving bf. But after the 2 months when the sparks had started to fade, I started acting differently. I stopped being excited before meeting him. I started to notice the incompatibilities between us, which mainly came the age and background thing; we think v differently (maybe bcs im from academia and hes not). 

So, I started looking for others (i know i'm a horrible human being). And i found another guy lets say tyler(fake name) 23M, which is my current bf. We share so many similarities and i love him so much. We started texting while i was still with my ex. He knows the story with my ex but not this specific detail.

Okay so back to jake. One day (2 months in) he found out abt me cheating and he asked me to choose one, him or my cur. I didnt choose anyone bcs the thing with tyler wasnt very promising at that time, basically i dont want to lose anyone. So me and jake broke up that day. It was my first break up and it hurts. I cried the whole night. The next day jake texted me asking me to come back with him. I said yes (another mistake). All of this happenned while i was still texting with tyler. Jake knew this but cant do anything since i said we're just gaming buddies

After a week or so, me and tyler become closer and closer and we decided to go gym together regularly. While i was constantly making excuses to not go gym with jake. I barely met jake, once or twice a week. He kept asking if i still text tyler where i lied.

3 months in, jake's wife found out abt me and they got divorced. A few days later me and tyler got together. I wanted to dump jake but the tiny tiny leftover kindness in me telling me to wait for a while before leaving him. A few weeks passed by, me and tyler become more and more closer. I started to worry abt the jake situation ruining my current relationship. So i dumped jake, few weeks after he got divorced.

1 months passed by (5 months since first i got together with jake), every day he's begging me to go back to him. And every day i replied with no by saying ""i was just curious"", ""i didnt actually love him"", etc. Sometimes when i got very annoyed by his constant texting i replied with harsh word like talking abt his body like that. (Before u guys said just block him, i tried and he kept making another account to contact me, so its useless). He even threatened to tell my family that im gay if i didnt meet him (im still closeted and live in a conservative family). So i met him telling him i wanna focus with my phd and not wanna be in a relationship anymore. And he stopped texting me

For a while.

1 moths later he came to my house asking me if i wanna grab some coffee. I said no. He threatened me again by outing me to my family. So we made an agreement with several points, but the main point is i reply to his text and meet once a week, he will never say anything to my fam, and we will never get back together (i know this agreement favored me but he's desperate at thi point, i will tell u guys later). This was the point where i told tyler abt all the situation with jake. He was okay with it and he's happy that i was being open with him.

Okay so we're going back to before i broke up with tyler for the 1st time, when things started to become stale. Basically when jake's wife found out abt me she wanted to meet me and report me to the police or meeting my family. Jake defended me and chose to divorce his wife to be full-time with me, in which he said the sacrifice. All this without telling me anything.

So recently jake told me this and we got into heated argument. My argument was why not speak abt this and discuss. I said ""i never asked for any sacrifice and u know i cheated yet u still stupidly leftyour family"". In his defence he said "" i didnt want her to out me to my family"". 

Now his mental health went down to the point of he almost going crazy (from the trauma). He's alone now with all his family and friends left him (bcs his wife out him). I felt bad so i started to check him daily. Every day whenever i visit him he ask me to go back with him but i always reply with no. He doesnt know im with tyler and i will never tell him bcs that would hurt him. I care abt him now bcs i feel guilty. I dont want him to hurt himself. Thats why i check on him daily but he always cry everyyime he sees me so i dont know what to do.I feel like anything i do will harm him.",2,1727937540.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False
1fv1la7,https://www.reddit.com/r/eotu/comments/1fv1la7/eotu_fanfiction_part_2/,Eotu fanfiction part 2,"The lab was quiet, a thick veil of silence blanketed the workspace, interrupted by the occasional typing on a computer or the wet slurping noises of coffee.

The man too was silent, he was bent down over a large glass vivarium inside of which a monstrous tarantula was resting peacefully atop a towering vertical branch. It was asleep, it's glossy black eyes devoid of expression.

The man observed the creature, it seemed calm and yet could be so deadly when it wanted to. He glanced over to the tarantulas huge black fangs, glistening in the light from the heat lamp above and imagined what they could do if they were human sized.

A voice boomed from behind him.

- Ah! I see you've familiarized yourself with Bloody Mary!

The man turned around sharply to view the new arrival. It was a man, tall and bulky with a thick, long beard that stretched all the way down to his chest. His hair was curly and his eyes a deep black. He was smiling broadly as if nothing could please him more than to see the stranger observing his tarantula.

- We call her that because she can be really ferocious when she wants to. Don't let her calm demeanor fool you.

The bearded man stared lovingly into the tank.

- Indian ornamental, he said proudly, very common in the pet trade!

Of course, the man already knew this. He had been fascinated by animals of all kinds since he was little. Seeing this beautiful spider before him was awe inspiring, he inspected every inch of her body, her joints, her ligaments and large silvery abdomen that contained the vital organs.

This creature had potential, he could see it. But before he could form the general blueprint of his idea he was interrupted yet again by the bearded guy.

- Come! He said while putting his hand on the man's shoulder, I will show you your desk!

The man shrugged, he hated physical contact. And the bearded mans giant hands were unusually warm to the touch.

Nevertheless, he followed him through the rows of lined up desks filled with terrariums of all sorts untill finally reaching a spotless white table with an equally spotless white office chair waiting for him.

His previous terrarium had already been placed on the table along with a duffel bag filled to the brim with various equipment.

- Well, this is it! The bearded man said. If you need anything just ask the controller!

The man was eager to begin work. There was much that needed to be done, and the equipment was calling to him, begging to be used. But one thing was missing from the great table.

- Where would I find the jelly? He inquired.

- Oh you won't be needing that! Said the bearded man. This substance is extremely volatile and we can't risk bringing it out of the vessel in it's unrefined state!

A shock rushed through the man's brain as he tried to process what he just heard.

- You aren't going to provide jelly for the tests!? He exclaimed.

- Now now my good friend, there's no reason to be surprised, said the bearded man, the primary purpose of you're experiments should be to study the behavior of these ants! Figuring out what makes them immune to these effects.

- But how am I supposed to do that without jelly? He desperately asked.

- All in good time. Now, why don't you get started at typing a behavioral matrix for your ants? He asked. When the time is right, proper tests will proceed.

And he left the man at his desk after giving him one last tap on the shoulder.

Inside, the man was fuming.

Not only was he being infantilized by this condescending corporate buffoon, but apparently his work had no greater purpose than to merely study the ants! What about his mission? His previous work? The incredible powers of the jelly were right there, he could taste it!

All in good time they said, soon the said. But they did not understand, his ants needed constant exposure, otherwise they might risk losing their immunity. And then lord knows when a new compatible subject may appear.

He needed to act fast, for his research, for all of mankind.

He looked into the terrarium where the colony had grown significantly since he last saw them.

- behavioural matrix? He muttered. I'll show then behavioural matrix!

He knew where the vessel was located, he had been there before, the first time he every layed eyes on the jelly and saw his reflection in it's smooth surface.

All he needed was a jar.

He made his way to the vivarium section of the lab and grabbed an empty glass container resting on a shelf.

That's when he noticed that the tarantula was awake, and watching him. It's multiple soulless black eyes locked on the glass jar in his hands.

For a second, the man had the uncanny feeling that the creature had some kind of mental connection to her owner but he quickly shrugged off that idea and exited the main lab into the corridor.

The door made an all to loud sound when he opened it and stepped into the hallway.

The corridor was empty, and lined with rows of white doors. The man walked tensely to the end of the hall, fearing that the bearded man would appear out of nowhere and ask him where he was going with his empty jar.

He had almost reached the right door now, his heart was racing, it was now or never.

He reached for the handle and pulled but was met with resistance. The door was locked, of course. His heart sank to his stomach. What a fool he had been, to assume that anyone would have unlimited access to the jelly.

He was sweating abundantly now, but brought himself to calm down and inspect the lock. It was a standard office one and evidently you needed both a key and a four digit code to open the heavy metal door.

All in good time. He swallowed, and tried to appear relaxed as he made his way back to the lab. For now, he would inspect his equipement and see what he had to work with.

As he made his way back to his desk he was constantly expecting for his coworkers to question his trip to the hallway but they were all too absorbed by their computer screens to even notice his return in the silent atmosphere of the workspace.

He opened the duffel bag and laid out it's contents neatly on the table.

This was his third unpleasant surprise of the day. The scalpels were rusty and one of them was slightly bent. His surgical scissors had evidently not been used in a long time, judging from the thick layers of grime covering the blades. And to top it off none of the transposition canisters had been cleaned from the remains of the previous inhabitant, and one of them was missing a lid.

He was feeling more frustrated than ever, apparently he was the only one that saw purpose in his work. Management hadn't even took the care to bring him proper equipement. Why must everything allways go against his will?

Now, for the few positive parts of the collection. The curette was in acceptable condition and there was a neat collection of needles ranging from 10 centimeters in length to being no longer than a paperclip. But the real star of the show came out when he shook the duffel bag to see if there was anything remaining.

An electric surgical saw, top of the line. With a streamlined shape and a circular, well polished blade.

Now THIS, was something he could use. He checked if the saw had batteries but saw that it was lacking, and made his way towards the equipment closet with new energy. Perhaps he could take some peices of equipement there for his own purposes, he was sure that they would be more of use in his experiments than collecting dust in the closet.

But just as he was about to reach out to grab the handle a loud, blaring alarm went off in the entire building. The man's heart made a loop in his stomach, and he begun to panick. Surely they hadn't heard his thoughts about stealing equipment from the closet had they? Or had they seen surveillance footage of him trying to open the door to the overflow vessel? He hated himself in that moment, to think he was stupid enough not to check for security cameras before attempting to steal jelly.

But all of his worries were soon dismissed when he saw the other scientists in the lab rise from their chairs and make their way towards the exit in a nonchalant way, some of them walking past him to inspect a sheet of paper that hung on the wall near the lab door.

The man glanced over at it, it was the weeks menu. This was just the lunch hour alarm. He laughed internally. Of course that was what got these animals moving. Not the prospect of scientific research but instead the promise of a serving of cold potato salad and a glass of milk.

""Stuff yourselves then."" He muttered. ""I'll be handling the lab I your absence.""

He had no interest in food, the work must go on.

The lab was quiet now with most scientists gone. He quite liked it. It was not only calmer and less oppressing but he also felt more important having this entire lab to himself.

He glanced at the clock, he had more than enough time to ""borrow"" some proper equipement from the other desks before the other returned. But not too much, so as to not draw attention, just a scalpel there and a pipette there and perhaps a few clean transposition canisters while he was at it. But first he needed something, ""batteries!""

He looked over to the counter where the tarantulas terrarium was resting, and besides it, a cardboard box of A++ batteries, just the ones he needed.

As he made his way towards the terrarium he noticed once again the uncanny silhouette of the spider observing him from it's hollow. He shuttered, he wished the arachnid had gone to lunch with the others.

Suddenly, he had a vision. And right then he knew what to do. It was going to be large, menacing, perhaps something with wings...

He allowed his thoughts to drift as he inspected the spiders body and formed the last details of his plan. And for the first time since his arrival in the lab, he smiled. He inched closer to the tarantula, towering over it, almost bringing himself to seizing it but he knew he couldn't, yet.

The spider began to back away into it's nest. The man saw fear in it's eyes and he loved it, he loved the power it brought him.

""Yes, yes retreat to your hollow."" He thought.

""You'll be joining my experiments very soon.""

1fv1k5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1fv1k5a/mixed_signals_from_lesbian/,Mixed signals from lesbian ,"So I'm a gay girl and this lesbian (she/they) at my college seemed to be coming on to me for a few weeks. I was really attracted to them, probably more than I've ever been attracted to anyone in my life, and got the vibe that she was into me too. 

She would seemingly take little detours around the campus just to talk to me when she had no classes in those areas until, one day, she literally asked me where I lived and then invited herself to my apartment with wine (wine!!). *Not* a coffee shop at 3pm, *not* a casual hangout with mutual friends - but the two of us alone at *my place* with *wine*.

I was so fucking thrilled about it because I had a shitty coming out experience and have finally reached a point where I'm ready for something genuine.

During the same conversation where she invited herself to my place, it had come up that my scooter wasn't working and that I lacked the ""Home Depot"" lesbian skills to fix it, so they offered to bring their toolbox and fix it for me. Later that night, I jokingly sent her a little juicy text and asked her when she ""wanted to swing by with her toolbelt"" (which was clearly a reference to a strap-on). About an hour later, she responded with ""whenever! my schedule's a little crazy but honestly whenever.""  
  
The next morning in school, she was surrounded by her friends who were all laughing at me throughout the day. I don't know if they had heard of our juicy text conversation, but it sure seemed like they had.

But then she started distancing herself from me. 

I thought I'd give them some space in case they'd changed their mind and a few days later, they said they'd prefer to just hang out during the day instead and asked me if they could bring their dog to my place. She specifically added that she didn't want to ""rush too much."" I of course said that was okay and that I wouldn't rush her into anything, which she responded to with a heart emoji.

**But then I found out that she was engaged.**

I specifically found out right after I sent her a little flirty text saying how she'd distracted me in class, which was *way* *less* *sexual* than the text I'd sent her about her ""tool belt."" I don't know if her girl saw the text or whatever, but that's when she broke the news to me. And when I called her out on how she should have let me know sooner, before inviting herself to my place with wine since that was inappropriate under the circumstances, **she never texted me back.** 

Almost two weeks have passed by since and she didn't approach me until today. When she did, she said I'd been ghosting *her* but that she was sorry if she'd given me the wrong impression and said she really loved her fiancée. They also said they invite themselves to other people's apartments all the time and just love to drink wine. It seemed genuine, but then she said she never ***even knew that I was queer.*** 

That part *really* threw me off because even though I'm hella feminine (chapstick femme here), I'd made sure to let her know in every damn conversation that I was a lesbian. On top of that, a mutual friend of ours (also a lesbian) definitely knows I'm gay, so it just made no sense.

At the end of the conversation, it seemed like she wanted to give the possibility of a friendship another try and made it very clear she's not leaving her girl, but I'm left feeling hella confused and hurt and I don't know what to think or if a friendship would even be remotely healthy for me. I don't think it would be. 

HELP!

Was it just my ego? Did I assume based on the fact that I'm a femme and they're a masc that I'd be appealing to them? Am I too quick to assume shit? And if they really just wanted a friendship, why would they take such a long time to attempt to clear things up?",2,1727937311.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

Yes, get a cushion to hold against your stomach. 
Yes, get a pregnancy pillow for bed. 

Here's my brief story:
Had an attack out of the blue over Christmas in 2023. I phoned 111 at the time and they suspected gallstones. The lovely nurse said that i could go to A&E but all they'd be able to do there is manage the pain, so i decided to not to bother. By the time I'd stopped writhing around and vomiting enough to phone 111 I was over the worst anyway. 

I spoke to my GP on the phone - she bought me in for blood tests and booked an ultrasound. I had the ultrasound at the end of January which confirmed stones. 

Back to the GP and they referred me for surgery. 

Between then and seeing the surgeon i read all about gallstones and realised I'd actually been having symptoms for ages! I started eating low fat and was quite pissed off when the weight didnt fall off me 😊

Saw my surgeon in August, so about an 8 month wait. I had no big attacks in that time. She explained the risks of surgery and said I had 3 options. I could watch and wait, I could keep the referral open for 6 months and make a decision later or I could have surgery. When I opted for surgery she told me that most people did, because they were terrified of another attack. She booked me into her diary at that appointment and told me it would be 2nd October. 

It went quiet for another few weeks then I got my appointment letter and an appointment for pre-op. 

Pre op was EKG, blood tests, height, weight, blood pressure. 

Yesterday (eviction day) i was told to arrive at the hospital at 11.30am. I needed to shower before I came in, remove jewellery and couldn't eat after 7am, but could drink water until i was admitted. 

Nurses were fantastic! Everyone I met was lovely! 

I was taken to a bed, had to give a urine sample to check I wasn't pregnant. The nurse checked that i was the right person, expecting the right operation and then I put compression stockings on and a gown. I was in a single sex ward, 4 beds. 

The surgeon came to see me and we filled in a consent form. 

The anaesthetist came to see me and we filled in more forms ( allergies, reactions to previous anaesthetic etc). She explained what would happen - id be walked down to the theatre, there'd be more checks that I was the right person and right procedure, there'd be lots of people about all attaching me to various monitors and putting in a cannula. 

All true. I climbed onto the trolley myself, wearing gown, knickers and stockings. There was a heat pad underneath me and another on top of me and then a blanket. 

They asked me to breath into a mask. I counted 4 breaths and then I zonked out. 

Woke in Recovery, very confused. The nurse immediately asked if i was in pain and when I said that I was she gave me more painkillers - i was already on IV paracetamol and ibuprofen. 

I stayed in recovery for a bit then was wheeled back to the ward. I had coffee and biscuits, needed to be able to pass urine and then allowed home. 

I got to the hospital at 11.30
Went to theatre at 2.10
Came out of theatre at about 3.20
Woke up at 4.10
Back to the ward at 4.30 then could go home at 6.

Feel great today! Incisons ache, theyre not painful. The gas pain is annoying but manageable. I slept ok, partially upright on a pregnancy pillow. Im keeping on top of my paracetamol and ibuprofen - they sent me home with morphine but I can't see me needing to use it. 

Hope this helps - i couldn't find much information about what to expect on the day and I read a lot of bad experiences so wanted to give another side. 
Once i was in the hospital the nurses were so reassuring - everything ran like clockwork. ",1,1727937162.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Despite the fact that controller support is being actively worked on for the console port (and will be backported to PC!) I didn't want to wait 6 months or more for a native feature that I could already have - right now!

Despite a couple of *quirks* that you'd expect from a jury-rigged system, it worked extremely well and would thoroughly recommend to anyone who is willing to tinker. 

# Prerequisites:

I used ReWASD, which is a paid program to remap controllers. I bought this years ago since, at the time, it was the only program that could remap the Xbox Elite paddles. Since then, it seems that the native Xbox Accessories app in Windows will actually let you remap buttons to keypresses now; you might be able to get very close to my current setup using only free software like Joy2Key or simliar. Now that ReWASD has moved to a stupid subscription model I would not recommend it going forward.

# Layout theory:

Given Satisfactory has **SO MANY** dedicated buttons, I had to use a combination of button presses, button holds (if the button triggers for longer than say 300ms, a different key is pressed), as well as shift toggles (where a dedicated button \*shifts\* the rest of the buttons onto a secondary mapping list). I also noted that the existing radial menus, like the scanner and the quick select shortcut, worked extremely well using a thumbstick. The more of these in the future, the better!

# Control map:

**Sticks:** movement and camera (as usual for all FPS games). Left click was crouch, right click was toggle sprint. Since I play inverted on controller, but the menus required 'normal' mouse directions, I had to set the mouse input as inverted in Satisfactory to get the directions to work properly. It's always really disconcerting if I have to occasionally use the mouse in first person!

**Triggers:** mouse buttons. Surprisingly, it seems the RMB is very underutilised and could probably be utilised more.

**Start/Back:** were menu and map, respectively

**Face buttons:** A for jump. X for interact. B for esc/cancel. Y for inventory. B was set to hold for dismantle - that way I can tap B to exit a menu, but hold B when I wanted to deliberately remove a building. Holding X to quick select similar buildings was rather awkward since I'd also have to use my other thumb to actually select from the radial menu using the right stick, and wasn't ideal.

**Shoulder buttons:** Both were set to mousewheel scroll up and down. This worked great for hand item selection, but rather average in actual scrolling windows - since I had to tweak ReWASD to not scroll continuously but instead single press so as not to overshoot my preferred hand tool.

For shoulder button holds, LB became the building picker (MMB) and was by far the most used interaction. RB was mapped to R as reload/build mode etc. I actually didn't use it for reloading at all - turns out just clicking your mouse does it automatically when your rebar gun or rifle is empty - so it just stuck to the usual R key functions.

**Dpad:** The Dpad has a lot of potential functionality, but I didn't really capitalise on it as much as I could have. The primary buttons were set to the arrow keys for nudging. For the holds, I had Left for the build menu, Down for H (hands and hold), Right for the scanner, and Up for the flashlight. 

**Paddles:** Having the Elite controller gives me an advantage that Coffee Stain won't have when they rebuild the UI and bindings! Having said that, using the paddles was also not really capitalised upon (I only used 3 of the 4) and I probably could have optimised my bindings better for fore efficiency^(TM). I had one for Ctrl (for snapping) and one for Alt (for hotbar scrolling with the bumpers), but I really didn't use the various hotbars enough to make it worthwhile. The third paddle was mapped as the Shift button, as below...

**Shift Buttons:** For simplicity, I used the Shift buttons mapped from 1 to 9 as the hotbar shortcuts across the face of the controller. 1, 2, 3 were Left, Up, Right on the Dpad, 456 as Left Up Right on the right stick, then finally 789 as XYB on the face buttons. To select 1 I'd hold the Shift paddle and then press left on the Dpad, and then I'm ready to string up some power lines! The shift buttons really didn't work great on the stick, but if I'd put 4 on the Dpad AND the face buttons for 8 shortcuts in total I would have been very happy with that. I didn't want to shift any more extraneous buttons than the number keys since it's so much to remember.

# Drawbacks:

Being able to mouse with the stick for most menus was ideal, as was pressing B (esc) to leave most menus - although it doesn't work on ALL menus so I think there's some UI inconsistency at play. I didn't have any way to access the codex from the controller - it was always easier and faster to type N and do maths or search with the keyboard, and I don't see any way that could be rectified on a console sadly. Likewise, the dismantle filter (G) I didn't know what to do with, but I so rarely made mistakes (HA!) that I didn't really use it much at all. 

Trying to aim onto small or distant buildings - like placing powerlines - was difficult with the lack of precision.

# Advantages:

Being able to toggle hold a building, then nudge around with the Dpad meant that building was honestly a breeze, even with the lower precision of a controller. I was honestly just as fast placing buildings, manifolds, blueprints, whatever by hand with the snapping that I would have not been any faster than 110hrs had I been exclusively on KB&M. But by far the biggest advantage was the lack of pain - I can only stand KB&M for a couple of hours in any game before I get really bad pain from wrist/carpal tunnel, and I do not ever get the same pain when using a controller even from 6hrs+ in any game. 

# Conclusion:

Despite the initial hurdles, and trying to map buttons to where they would 1) make sense (A is *always* jump!) and 2) not clash with inputs was definitely doable. I probably could have made more use of the left trigger and more holds (like the Y button) and avoided the paddles to increase the general 'mappability' to other players with standard controllers, but it would all be to personal preference anyway. I definitely recommend a controller, and can now definitively say it's possible to complete the game with it!",4,1727936922.0,SatisfactoryGame,2,1.0,False

I have always been very shy and never been in a relationship or really dated before (and still haven’t). With the son, he didn’t seem super interested in me or my roommate in general despite us being strangers in his house and honestly I wasn’t that interested either. But the more I got to be around him and got to know him, the more I liked him. He pretty much embodied everything I’d ever wanted in a guy. I eventually worked up the nerve asked him to see a movie with me which went really well just in terms of getting to know him. We did become a lot more friendly after but nothing really changed. We also hung out a few more times in group settings but never one on one again. Beyond that nothing really happened other than small moments in conversations and him noticing things about me that he’d bring up in passing (remembering the books I’ve read, my love of coffee over tea, etc.). 

As I said before I’m kinda shy and very awkward at times and so I feel like I didn’t fully show him myself and didn’t really express how much we had in common which ended up being quite a lot. Also I feel like I didn’t show him that I liked him while I was there and even blocked a few moments where it seemed like he was testing the waters. 

We did end up texting back and forth for around 5 months after I left (July to Dec). It was never serious (very sporadic on his end but he’d told me he was bad at texting and also that he didn’t want long distance as that’s why him and his ex broke up). However it’s over a year later and I still can’t let go of my feelings for him. Honestly I think it’s more due to the circumstances (being in a gorgeous country that I’ve wanted to live in forever, his family being the absolute best, and having read too many wattpad books growing up where this kind of thing happened) but also I really did like him. I feel like I just regret not being clear that I did like him while I was there and really I don’t know how to get over him.

Also thought I’d provide some tips for people putting their first one together; they’re not the end-all of tips but what I find has helped me out based on my circumstances. ✨

1. Regarding space, I’ve read that she doesn’t seem to mind where it is, what it looks like, and in fact, the ancients used to put Her altar close to the floor or even in caves. I placed mine in my closet because I don’t have much space in my room. 

2. There are some items iconic to her — keys, garlic, eggs, candles — which I consider a non-negotiable for myself since I have a space where I’m free to worship Her. I also recommend putting some items of your culture to personalise your altar and create a connection with Her. I placed a lotus herb burner and a lotus leaf incense burner because the lotus in Chinese culture means purity, rebirth, and divinity—how she has led me to do things out of honest intention as I’m trying to “shed” my old ways and attune myself to Her divinity.

3. Really, really, really consider your space and your worship habits. If you look at my previous altar, you’d notice I really went all out. The reorganisation meant I finally got having to do a “WOW” altar out of my system and focusing instead on my habits = I pour coffee into a goblet everyday for Her and then replace it with fresh water so I decided to move it closer to the altar edge to prevent spillage. I also removed some items by considering what the statue already has; the snake figurines as there’s already one on Her statue for example. This new reorganisation has made it easier for me to clean it everyday instead of waiting till Deipnon and having to do an intense cleanup. 

4. To clean it, I like to soak a micro fibre towel in Khernips and then wipe the altar down before using a dry one to sop up excess water. I also like to drop 3 drops of an oil blend (specially made for Her) onto Her statue and burn lavender incense till it burns completely. Next, I pour moon water over Her statue and let it air dry before placing it back. I then rearrange everything and burn lavender incense for Her. I know some people claim they energetically cleanse Her altar every Deipnon but I don’t as I believe it’s the most “powerful” space in my room as it’s sanctified based on everyday my prayers to Her but to each their own—though I have cleansed it before I first placed Her on on it. 

5. Consider substitute items if you’re unable to procure the original. I fill a goblet of pomegranate juice for her as oddly, it’s very hard to come by pomegranates in my country’s supermarkets. I also know some who place crystal eggs instead of raw eggs so do what you can with what you have!

6. Have fun doing it and express your own creativity because that’s the most important. And if you love how you did your altar while ignoring the “rules” or “regulations” that don’t make sense to your situation, then you’d be even more inclined to spending time at the altar worshipping Her.
