1jiiddp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetPeople/comments/1jiiddp/32f_chat_anyone_would_like_to_chat_and_see_where/,"(32F) [chat] Anyone would like to chat and see where things go? In this moment of feeling mentally and spiritually drained, for reasons you can look at the post I posted recently. But for now, let's get to know each other.","Random trivia facts are in my head right now and other things people have asked me. 

I should address games I failed to mention. 

When I played the old Sonic games as a kid, I assumed I could use Tails to cheat across the map. 

Favorite Sonic characters are Shadow Sonic, Knuckles, and Amy.

Minecraft makes me sleepy, so it's a great game to have to fall asleep to, but it's somewhere buried in my room; I have to find it.

Fortnite, I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I never played it. That is because I always got up to co-op online gaming with my friends with Nintendo games that I honestly forgot about looking at Fortnite, oops. That's just how my mind is. If you ever want to ask for my Nintendo Code, sure, that's fine, and also I can tell you what my Fall Guys profile is as well.

I do have the McDonald's Rayquaza kids meal box and Charizard. I wasn't able to score the other boxes like Dragonite because I kept on getting Charizard. I did manage to get some of the different mini posters that had Rayquaza on the mini poster; I even got the Rayquaza card and the holographic Pikachu card. In the future, I will be looking out to get the Dragonite kids meal box and any of the mini flyers I'm missing.

Do you have any other interests? Besides, what communities do you tell us to go look at on the mobile Reddit app to see what you're into?

Let's see. Sure.

There have been quite a heap of comments that I got from people that have told me that he is into theater arts, woodworking, crafts, art projects, crafting, and learning about different types of cultural backgrounds, and I will say this: if this is the type of person you are, that's really cool. I tend to get along with the type of video game nerds that have other hobbies like this/are introverted; those are my kind of people that are awesome friends. I really love having friends that get enthusiastic about sharing something he created from an art project or craft project. I also will let friends just text about video games for the whole day; that's fine by me, haha. I will say though for the person that messaged me about culture backgrounds, yes, that is a high interest. The main reason why I love cultural backgrounds is to learn about occultist lore, folklores, and folktales from Japan or other Asian video games. Gab Smolders and CJU have also played a lot of indie Asian horror games based on folklore and folktales passed down to Asian cultures.

I previously asked if Fatal Frame is worth playing; well, that depends on what kind of gamer you are. Do you like reading things, or do you like breezing through things? If you have no interest in reading and are only looking for some good scares, then sure, but if you're looking for a good plot/story, then this is a game that requires you to read the folklorist notes and other notes to fully understand the folklore behind old Japanese occultist beliefs. 

I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I personally think my favorites based on the Japanese occultist beliefs of interest are Fatal Frame 4, Fatal Frame 5, Fatal Frame 3, Fatal Frame, and Fatal Frame 2. Keep in mind this is based on the SUBJECTS of Japanese folklore/folktales and what INTERESTS ME THE MOST. This has nothing to do with gameplay ranking but subjects of interest. I hope that makes sense in a way.

I know the game Kuon and have seen Let's Plays of Kuon.

I know games similar to the Clock Tower series and have seen Let's Plays of the Clock Tower series; personally, 3 is my favorite.

I also know of the Xenosaga series as well.

I found the Plague Tales series sadder than the Last of Us cash grab.

I know of the Croc games as well; as you can see, my video game knowledge is very vast, haha.

I'm sure if you gave me a video game title, I could either have heard of it or seen a Let's Play. My video game knowledge is vast.

I would just ask me if I heard or knew about this game; if I kept typing what games I knew, we would be here the next afternoon, haha.

Someone asked who my favorite DMC character is. 

V, Nero, and Lady.

Favorite DMC Games

3 and 5.

Worst was 2.

But every DMC fan will tell you 2 was the worst. I love all DMC games but 2. But 3 or 5 is my favorite if asked.

You can tell me what the worst video game you have ever played is, based on controls, camera angles, and story.

I'm an Alan Wake fan here; what a trippy story, cool stuff.

I still am subscribed to the Angry Video Game Nerd on my YT account.

Speaking of Let's Plays. Someone sent me a message that he enjoys watching Let's Plays because of anxiety; I get that. I don't like high-level stressful games or games that require you to use stealth and hearing, which, don't get me wrong, is an awesome concept for video games. But I'm not really good at those kinds of games; I really am not. That also includes premium trophy runs.

So, I'd rather just see someone else play them instead. Sometimes I just like to sit back and relax with a movie version of a video game. What I mean by a movie version is there are YT content creators that turn the whole video game into a movie by using all the cutscenes, and some YT content creators add cutscenes and boss fights only. Sometimes, I just like to sit back and just see the video game without any common battles or just having to level up. Instead I can just sit back and just see the video game in almost a cinema-style way. I do have one online friend who dislikes Let's Plays, and he would rather just play the video games himself and not see someone else play the video game instead. I have nothing to say towards my online friend because all video gamers have their own likes and dislikes. What matters the most is if you can disagree in a respectful manner and have healthy disagreement debates without being toxic to one another.

I also like blind boxes, blind bags, and anything related to getting a mystery. Speaking of video games, do you know that Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have blind boxes and bags? Yeah, this is something that is just way far back in time, but yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have come out with blind boxes and bags, even Yu-Gi-Oh! has as well, which one day when I get my own space I want to start collecting those.

Have I ever gotten a chase from a blind bag?

Yes, from Monogram International Godzilla 3D Foam Bag Clip – Classic Series 5, and this was only one blind I opened. I got the Godzilla classic 1954 chase.

I've had Hokkaido Butter snacks before; they're really interesting.

Chat request:

I don't reply/respond to comments; chat requests are accepted. Thanks for tuning in during this very tiring spiritual time. If you would like more information on what to send in your chat request besides Hi, how are you doing? What's up? You can look at my comments I posted/replies, my older post, and the communities I'm in; that should help. But the reason why I don't reply/respond to comments is normally when I go to check my notifications because I've put my notifications off for comments; normally, it's criticism, so to solve that problem, I've muted those kinds of notifications. 

I also would say that yesterday I washed all my bedding, just put everything in the dryer, started the dryer, and just grabbed some extra sheets in the closet, used those to cover me on my bed, and fell asleep. Sometimes you just can't give a $$$$ anymore, you know? But one step at a time, I will get there. I just—how should I say this in expression? Being spiritual, I feel pain differently from others, and also being on the spectrum, I feel pain/grieving in different ways than others. It's just hard, but yesterday I did manage to clean my room and start to purify the energies in my room, meditate with Hades, and then just take a relaxing shower and meditate. Before I close out these posts, I wanted to say thanks to some of the members that were kind to me and messaged me to see if I could be your friend, a friend in aid. Thanks, that means a lot. 

I will say after my post I made recently, I'm not sure how I feel currently about just pausing my relationships and putting them on hold. It's just sometimes you just want to give up the battle, you know, when you know you're not good enough and you feel a lesser importance, then you just don't see a point, no way out. I'm glad that in this community some of the members messaged me to see how I was doing and to let me know that I'm not alone in this. Because to me personally, I thought my thoughts and theories about some people are just bound to have friendships only, and that is their given curse. I'm glad there were people out there that thought the same as me, so that was nice to know that with my weird way of how I perceive relationships and this bleak outlook on life, there are others that think just like me.

It's good to have friends like this, because I think I'm just way too weird to have friends. The way I think is weird, but I mean the spectrum mind makes you think not normally anyways. You process things differently than a normal person would; for some people, it's extremely hard to grasp that concept. But the truth is, these people are hidden gems on this subreddit. I came to realize there are people out there that relate to me. The thing is, it's just called self-doubt, and just like one of my online friends has told me, I don't acknowledge my self-worth; well, that's because I don't want to acknowledge my full worth, and it's better to leave things as is and forget about it.

I'm going to go watch some Let's Plays on YT, relax with the cats, and drink some Alini energy drink or make myself some iced coffee, watch the time go by, the stillness in the darkness, and just mentally and spiritually recover. Thanks to the people on this subreddit that want to take the storm tides with me, thanks so much. Sometimes when you sit in the darkness listening to the dark storms with you.

For people wondering about random facts about me, I do iced coffee at night because coffee only works for two or three hours, and then I'm tired. I'm always naturally tired, so caffeine doesn't have a very bad effect unless it's over 200 mg of caffeine; then I start to feel ill, haha. I'm a wee one, you see.

If I were an ice cream flavor based on my personality, what would I be and why?",1,1742789419.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

1jiibo1,https://youtube.com/@benmorningcoffees?si=btx1jRpQphhT1hXz,Turning My Morning Coffee into YouTube Content — Advice Wanted!,"Hear me out — I’ve started documenting my morning coffee-making routine on YouTube. Nothing fancy, just me making pour-overs in the quiet of the morning. The idea is to create content around something I’m already doing, with minimal effort, because between work and life, I don’t have the bandwidth to plan elaborate videos. It’s more of a “point the camera, do my thing, and share the process” kind of vibe.

I’m curious about growing this into something more. Right now, I keep it simple: one longer video of the full process and a shorter one that captures the highlights. It’s slow and personal, almost like a morning ritual captured on film. I figure if I’m already making coffee, why not press record? But I wonder if I’m missing opportunities — should I be talking through the steps, adding music, or maybe sharing thoughts over coffee?

For those of you who’ve grown a channel or have a passion project like this, what helped you build an audience? Should I lean into the peaceful, ASMR feel of it, or add more personality and storytelling? I want to stay true to the idea of documenting something I love without turning it into a second job.

I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1742789092.0,lookingforfriendship,0,1.0,False
1jii96r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eatingdisordersover30/comments/1jii96r/feeling_so_isolated_and_invalid_in_my_struggle/,Feeling so isolated and invalid in my struggle because my ED never gets called out by the universe,"I’m so frustrated and alone with all of my life fears.  (TL DR: praise for ED behaviors and being told I’m healthy makes it damn hard to see where the problem is ….I feel massive in size and like a fraud in heart) 

I don’t want this shit in my medical records and I don’t want a therapist or to be referred to HLOC…I don’t want a dietitian.  I have no intention of bringing more debt into my life nor do I crave a diagnosis.  I’ve had more than enough therapy and long ago scratched the itch to be diagnosed.  I’m very far gone from wanting any of that attention in my life.  In my 20s and 30s I wanted this eating disorder addressed in the real world and to tackle it….

It’s not like that anymore at this age.  It’s a private battle that no one knows of - and because of that,  it’s easy to forget it’s a problem.  I do however, want perspective on my situation without having to say a word .

I’m more than content to handle my mental health struggles alone.  What I do want, what I do pray for, are signs from the universe that if my ED is an actual problem (if there’s consequences beyond the mental obsession) then alert me to that universe—without the bullshit  that comes with involving the system.  So if I’m causing harm, let me know universe. Let the conversation happen where it may.  Maybe all I need and truly have wanted is to be asked “are you eating enough?” Or “you look tired, are you getting enough to eat?” Or someone to tell me I need to eat.  Again, I don’t want the hoopla of “coming out” to a professional—but I want a sense that maybe I’m doing something wrong.  So I can motivate myself to do better.  I look to clues in my medical interactions and blood work - is there a problem?

What do you do when instead of that small sign from the universe to “do better” the sign is “keep it up!”  I’m having some physical discomfort and went to the dr (they’re a nice dr but absolutely awful in tackling mental health issues beyond empathic listening).  I like my dr as person so I don’t want to badmouth, they genuinely mean well but fall flat on helping with mental health (severe depression and anxiety are what I’ve copped to over the years). For a doctors office, I feel like I’m the only patient who ever has said they have anxiety, just based on how inept they are… 

I stick with the office because I hate change and hate meeting new providers…it would be stressful to find a new doctor and I’ve been going here years.  The problem is deep down I know he’ll always miss the mark with the ED…even when my labs have been bad, it comes with little concern or hardly any questions.  I’ve been there in some shitty states (not recently) and I think a different doctor would’ve probed me more on the eating.  I feel both let down and relieved it’s not been called out during this years long relapse.  

He declared me in good health based on labs and said I should exercise as much as makes me happy ——why does hearing that make me feel so confused? How can I feel run down all the time and be healthy ? I feel like I’m gaslighting myself and the universe will never tell me to slow down.  Never tell me to take it easy.  Never ask me if I’ve had enough to eat.  Even with pain, it wasn’t a concern about exercising-just so much praise for my habits.   And this is what happened when I faced the dentist with all my malnourished teeth—I was so afraid I would be discovered and confronted and then disappointed when not only was nothing asked, the dentist said I inspired her to work out after chatting with me.  Again, not wanting a grand intervention but a sign from the universe that my ED has ….consequences? 


At my appointment for this pain, my dr and I talked about running trails and the advice was along the lines of how awesome my dedication to fitness is ….maybe he’s right ? I mean, if he declares me in good health,  why am I looking for a problem? *Why ? Because sometimes I want a reason to ease up on the ED…only my life will never give me that sign.*

So basically,I don’t look like have an ED…professionals praise my exercise and there’s no physical reason to be wiped out. 

So where are my signs universe? Where is that moment of care, where the world tells me to rest and eat…why must the only message be “keep doing everything you’re doing”

More hunger ? More eating with my hands in front of the sink because I don’t know how to eat a real meal? More tracking my weight before the coffee, after the coffee but before the workout …..  this is what flashes before me when some iteration of “keep it up” gets tossed my way.    Keep all of that up? I’m looking for a break, not blank slate encouragement. No one will ever declare it a problem unless I do…and I just want something to inspire me to eat, rest ….and that hasn’t happened in a very long time.   

I’m so triggered, here I’m in pain and yet I feel like I have to keep exercising because no one told me to stop or slow down.  ",1,1742788998.0,Eatingdisordersover30,1,1.0,False

So I (24M) matched with this (22F) a few weeks ago and immediately over chat we hit it off. We had the same nerdy interests and sense of humor, it seemed too good to be true. So, I asked her out for drinks, and the first date went incredibly well. It ended up lasting 4 hours and probably would’ve went longer if we didn’t have to be up early the next day. I paid for everything including her uber ride home. 

We continued to text and she seemed to get more and more attached to me, honestly, maybe even too attached. I didn’t really mind this, though, and I kept the same energy she had. So, I planned a 2nd date which I had just planned to be a 2 hour museum date; however, we had such a good time it turned into a 10 hour (you read that right) journey around the city. We grabbed coffee, got dinner, and just walked around the city. Again, if I didn’t have to be up early, the date would’ve went longer. (I also paid for everything except her train ride home). Throughout the date, she kept talking about all these plans for me to help her make easter baskets for the kids she nannies, having her teach me swiss, etc. etc. (This was a week ago). 

So, the next few days after the date, we continue texting and she keeps getting more and lovey-dovey and, again, I was fine with this. However, this all came to a screeching halt one morning where, all of a sudden, she became cold and disinterested. Her texts become colder and shorter, she stopped texting me good morning/good night and today (a week out from our last date) she hasn’t texted me at all but HAS been posting on instagram and she 100% knows I’m seeing her posts. Now, she DID go on a trip with her friends this weekend, so who knows what happened there and maybe that’s related, but the coldness started a day or two before the trip. 

Of course, we’re not exclusive so if she has found another option that is better for her then that is fine, I just feel a little left in the dark, confused, and hurt to be honest. She hyped everything up so much, I would at least like an explanation as to WHY I haven’t heard from her. 

So my question is: do I reach out to her and see what’s up, or do I just move on? ",1,1742788973.0,ghosting,1,1.0,False

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/QmbnAtb3KB): **March 6, 2025**

Ok Reddit I need some unbiased outside opinions because I truly feel like I’m going crazy dealing with this situation. 

I (28F) and my partner (28M) have 2 children together and have been married for 8 years, for those 8 years I’ve either been on birth control when we were preventing pregnancy or tracking my cycle when we were trying to conceive (adding this just to give the community the context that reproductive responsibility has always fallen on my shoulders). 

Recently we discussed the possibility of being done with children since we have our 2 and the family really feels complete, my partner is in agreement that a third child is off the table for him as well. So with that I thought “great! I can bring up sterilization for either him or I”, the reason I wanted this is because I’ve had every form of birth control before and none of them ever left me feeling 100% okay so I wanted to be done with birth control completely since we both agreed we’re done. 

It’s been about 3 months since our talk about more children so I brought up either getting a vasectomy for him or me getting a salpingectomy (removing my fallopian tubes), what I thought would be a productive conversation completely blew up. He outright refused a vasectomy and when I was okay with that and said I’d happily get a salpingectomy he completely flipped his shit on me, screaming at me about how he forbids it from happening and he won’t allow me to damage myself like that. I ended up just leaving the conversation and headed to get our kids from school but on the way I ended up calling my gynecologist to schedule a consultation for the salpingectomy after making sure I won’t need my spouse’s approval. 

So Reddit AITAH if I go through with the sterilization against my partner’s wishes?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments** 

**OOP responds to multiple comments about women needing their husbands' approval for this to take place with the sterilization** 

> **OOP:** Actually yes sadly, my friend had hers done a few months ago and her gynecologist required a sit down consultation with both her and her husband as well as a form stating that they understood the procedure and agreed to it signed by both parties

**Commenter 1:** Ew. He just tipped his hand to how he REALLY feels, and it's unsavory.

You're NTA, and I hate that you're questioning that. Your body. Your choice. You're done with kids, and this is a logical step.

Why does he feel this way so strongly on both of you? What has him so twisted?

> **OOP:** I honestly wish I knew, he seemed supportive of our friends (both men and women) who have had sterilization procedures

**OOP's location**

> **OOP:** US, Louisiana 

**Is the husband usually that controlling?**

> **OOP:** No he’s never shown any controlling behavior before, it’s completely blind sided me

**OOP should hide her birth control so her husband can't get to them**

> **OOP:** Thankfully I have the IUD, it’s been a bitch to my period but it’s done the job

&nbsp;

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/v9L6k2X63M): **March 7, 2025 (next day)**

Due to the support and advice I found on here I managed to get the confidence and level headspace needed to try to have another conversation with my partner. 

After getting our children to their school/daycare for the day I went to our local coffee shop to pick us up each a cup, I figured it can either be seen as a show of care or a peace offering. Once I got home he was sitting at our island doom scrolling through TikTok (I think we’ve all been there), I decided standing across from him would be a bit of a better choice so I gave us our respective cups and asked if I could get his attention for a conversation. 

Well what I hoped would be productive turned unproductive quickly as he sighed with an eye roll and turned off his phone, I started by asking the big question of if he wanted anymore children, I even suggested he doesn’t think about what I said on the subject and just tell me his feelings about more children; with that he answered a firm no and told me as he said before a third child is and will always be off the table. I then asked him if he had any fears or concerns about surgeries/medical procedures, he said no to this question as well. 

So I asked if he understood the procedure and what it entailed and he said yes he does which is why he doesn’t want me to get it done, in his words I wouldn’t be a woman if I got any part of my reproductive organs (what makes me a woman) removed and he refuses to allow me down that path. I then followed up by asking about his getting a vasectomy and he said it’s pretty much the same thing for men and he won’t let anyone take away if manhood. 

The final question I managed to ask was did he just expect me to be on birth control forever and this man looked me in m face and said it’s worked so well for me already why change things up, guys as I stated in my previous post I am miserable and in debilitating pain with birth control. At the end of this I just grabbed my coffee and went sit on our porch just trying to wrap my head around the conversation while he sit in the house acting like nothing is wrong and we’re just having a normal day off together…..

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I'm trying to find a respectful way to ask this but not coming up with anything so I'm just going to ask. Does your husband have any sort of intellectual impairment? The idea that you aren't a woman if you have surgery is so ridiculous that I can't believe a person with a 3 digit IQ would suggest that.

Is there any possibility that he'd participate in couples counselling?

> **OOP:** As far as I’m aware he’s perfectly fine mentally, I even would’ve called him intelligent before these recent discussions

**Commenter 2:** So he's already told you and shown you he doesn't care that you are in pain. What else can we tell you honey, he doesn't care for you in the same way you care for him

> **OOP:** I’m definitely realizing that, makes me feel like everytime he’s taken care of me due to the birth control issues was just a lie

**Has OOP considered about other types of birth control before going on the sterilizing journey** 

> **OOP:** Considering I’ve work with my actual doctor very closely since I’ve turned 18 to find a birth control that works well from me and they agree that my problems are caused by my birth control- for example being a bloody pain filled mess unable to get out of bed during my periods- I think I’ll stick to my doctor’s evaluations

**OOP explains the side effects**

> **OOP:** So my “minor” side effects are a heavy blood flow that I am constantly ruining clothes during my periods, pain so bad that I’m either unable to get out of bed or I pass out from it, depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts, and weight gain. The best times of my life is when I was off of birth control while we were trying to conceive our children, if wanting to be able to feel like that all the time is over emotional then I guess I am.

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/FdfiMWH4it): **March 9, 2025 (two days later)**

Hey Reddit I just wanted to give a small update, I’ve been reading all of your comments on my last two post I swear! I appreciate all the advice and kind words, sometimes even the unkind words because it gives me more to think about.

So to start I’ve been at my sister’s with the children all weekend, I told my husband that she was feeling lonely and wanted us to stay over, he believed it as we usually try to do this once a month. I called off of work Monday so my sister and I can meet with the divorce lawyer that handled her divorce, I’m unsure if divorce will be the path I go down but I want to get my ducks in a row before laying it all down for my husband.

Also I would like to answer some questions that I saw a lot of in my last post:

- Yes I still plan to go through with the sterilization, I absolutely don’t want anymore children even if this ends in divorce. I plan to tell him it’s getting done no matter what he says or believes.

- There will definitely be no sex with him anymore, I feel like I lost all attraction and respect for him.

- The children don’t know what going on, they just think it’s a fun time at auntie’s house.

- Condoms are a no, I exist because of a broken condom 😂

- I currently have an IUD and while yes it has been the best birth control I’ve been on I still cannot function properly for a week out of the month due to pain, bleeding, and depressive episodes.

- No he hasn’t done anything like this before which is what caught me so off guard with everything. Disagreements in our relationship have up until now been able to be discussed and compromised on.

- We grew up in a deep catholic community but fell away from the church years ago.

**Commenter 1:** 

> I plan to tell him it’s getting done no matter what he says or believes.

**Stop right there.** He will clean out your bank accounts. Get this done quietly and quickly. 

**Do not under any circumstances warn this man.** Do not dismiss the seriousness of this moment. This is how you get dead.

> **OOP:** Thankfully our finances for the most part are separated, the only joint bank account we have is for bills and child expenses

**OOP's thoughts on getting the procedure**

> **OOP:** I want the procedure for myself no matter my relationship status, I want to be done with birth control without a chance of children no matter where the future takes me. As well as the fact that this procedure reduces the risk of cervical cancer significantly which it’s common in my family so that’s a plus. I haven’t fallen out of love with him per say but I truly hold no respect for him right now with how he’s treated me over this, I’m unsure if we will divorce but I feel like it might be for the best especially if to him this will “damage me”.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Last Update for a bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/wFtfKySa6N): **March 17, 2025 (eight days later)**

So I would like to start off by saying thank you everyone for the amazing support I’ve received throughout the comments and messages, I know I haven’t replied in awhile but I have been reading it all. ♥️ 

Now to start off I’ll update everyone on the meeting with the lawyer, I was able to talk through my options as well as what legally would by my husband’s and what legally would be mine. I know my next steps of things would lead to divorce and I feel confident in taking those steps if needed. 

After the meeting I went back home and got settled back in. I ended up just doing normal task until the kids got home and when my husband got home i suggested getting the children to bed early so we can talk, so we did just that. He ended up starting the conversation by saying if I plan to get the sterilization then he wants a divorce because he can’t be with someone who doesn’t share his same values. 

At that moment I knew this was it for us, so I informed him of my consultation this week for the surgery and my intention to go through with it no matter what. There was honestly a lot of back and forth, I want to say it lasted for 3 hours before he said he’s done and left the house. He’s been staying at his mom’s and hasn’t really asked about the children staying with him, I have offered per the suggestion of my lawyer but to no avail. 

Currently I’m getting a legal separation agreement written up so hopefully start the divorce process peacefully or as peacefully as possible. The kids ask about him but I just keep telling them he’s helping grandma for a bit, I’m not sure how to tell them he won’t be back, thankfully my therapist suggested a children’s therapist to me so I plan to set them an appointment soon. 

I’m honestly not too sure where everything went wrong with us, I always felt like we had true love but maybe I was just naive to any of the other signs.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Some advice; document everything because he's going to make this as ugly as possible. Remain calm and civil at all times and, no matter what, don't ever lose your temper. If you're going to meet with him try to have someone come with you.

> **OOP:** I’ve already been keeping communications through text but I’ll definitely have someone with me if we meet. I know he plans to come this weekend to get some things but my sister has been staying with me so she’ll be here.

**OOP explains on the providers doing the procedures without needing spousal approval when many others require it**

> **OOP:** Thankfully that’s becoming less common, it seems a lot of providers are stating (at least in my area) when they’re open to doing these procedures without a spousal consent. My friend’s doctor wouldn’t even schedule her a consultation without her husband coming along

**Does OOP's partner know she met with a lawyer?**

> **OOP:** I haven’t mentioned meeting with a lawyer yet, I didn’t want to throw any gas onto the already lit fire especially with the kids home. His mom thinks we can still work it out and his dad seems to be staying out of it from what I’m understanding.

**Commenter 2:** So he wants to be able to force you to have more children he won't interact with? Cya by documenting everything and recording whatever you can and the home that he abandoned if he ever comes by. Always make sure any interactions with him in the future are verifiable whether by witnesses or recordings even if he says he's bringing his mom with him have your own witness there and possibly even record it.

He may try to push you into arguments with him and then record it when you blow up at him not showing the fact that he's been needing you for an hour. Like I said cya all of your interactions going forward need to be documented.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

I got laid off recently. I have been applying to 100+ jobs so far and tailored my resume based on JD, etc. Did not hear back from single company asking for a screening interview.

To be honest I felt so defeated and a couple weeks ago I started to reach out to everyone I know. I didn't want to reach out initially because I didn't want them to know I got laid off because, I guess I was ashamed by it? (it's a small industry)

Their advice was to reach out to people who are VP and up who has hiring power for which I don't have a direct connection always. (Basically 2nd degree connections). And they also said lots of jobs are posted these days are not real jobs; meaning they already have internal candidates therefore external people are not even considered, or some jobs aren't even posted as they have a waiting list of people who want to work there...

So I do need to get myself in that 'waiting list' queue and start to reach out to people that I am not that Any tips for this?

The little light blinks on occasionally.  However (and maybe this is expected), when I hit the pour button (to push water through the portafilter) I see the temperature rapidly decrease down into the 90s then 80s. Is this expected, do I need to let the machine warm up longer, pr do some sort of ""surfing"".

Like, I can just barely taste the subtle flavours of it, although I don't mind it if it's early in the morning, since it's not as harsh on an empty stomach.

I usually brew at 100c, 7-8g in a 90ml gaiwan, following 10-15-20-25 second increments until I make a full cup. Works great for raw puer, strong body, bitterness and full flavour. 2021 Gas has been my favourite raw puer so far. Nothing comes close to the flavour it has. I've tried teas like Red Loon, Lumber Slut, Old Reliable, but they are just not for me. The colour is deep brown and looks like coffee, but tastes nothing of the sort of the richness of flavour I'm after.

But so far, the only ripe puer that stood out to me was 5th Wave from White2Tea. Good bitterness, rich flavour, savouriness, very close to ""shitty diner coffee"" as they say. So, I'm looking for more suggestions on strong ripe puers from White2Tea if you have any? The stronger, the bolder, the better!

What gives?","All of my friends constantly tell me how wonderful  of a person I am. That I’m so nice, pleasant, and friendly. We have great conversations and we show mutual interest in each other. They always say “we totally need to hang out and grab a coffee sometime”. Yet, everytime I initiate and attempt to schedule a day to hang out, they bail. Every time! Key detail is that none of these friends know each other. 

Friend #1 is a former coworker, my “best friend” on the job. Someone who was so close to me she even visited me in the clinic when I gave birth. She nearly cried when I left, and constantly tells me how much she misses me and wants to meet up with me. So naturally, I invited her to grab a coffee, and she bailed last minute. She apologized and promised to reach out to me to reschedule, and never did. 

Friend #2 is someone I met at a gymnastics class of our children. She’s become such a friend, buying me and my kids random gifts, always offering to pick up my kid, plan outings together. But when I invited her over my place for brunch, she said she’d have to check her schedule and would get back to me. Never did. No clue why! 


Friend #3 and #4 were both my best friends from childhood. They don’t know each other. We recently hit it off so well chatting online and they each suggested we meet up for coffee. They both said they’d let me know by x date. Well, x day came and went, and I haven’t heard from either of them since.

I came to my local parish last year spring of 2024. I fell in love with this beautiful faith. At the time I was going through a break up and was physically ill. I was struggling with addiction to cigarettes and weed. And gave it up. Ive never been so happy not only for the closeness I've felt to God and all the faith has to offer but also the church family. My church is small and has a warm welcoming community. The priest is especially kind and welcoming. He used to be a counselor for many years and I found myself opening up to Him and telling Him about the breakup and my family situation( messy family situation (it's kinda like the duggars but Mabe worse idk) most of them are in a different state and we have been estranged I've been rejected for about 8 years.) I realized I started to lookup to my preist as almost a father figure and crave His approval. Before I leave church I  need to get His blessing or make sure everything was alright by saying goodbye and seeing a smile. I explained this to Him and have talked with Him He has been very understanding and kind. I have anxiety and OCD. I find myself trauma dumping to. So anyways There is someone I know at the church from before. He was a distant friend of my ex. We have a polite friendship because of that and got to talking about the faith we had such good conversations about the faith and God  I asked if He would become my sponsor. He said that boys can't be sponsors to girls but Mabe His wife well call her Ruth could be. Me being a people pleaser said ok and that I would ask her. Now I never really had met Ruth before but had seen her at church she seemed reserved and the 'perfect' Orthodox Christian girl. But I admired her and their virtuous marriage. I thought ok I asked her and she accepted. Now her husband (the friend) is the preists son. So they are all a family. Well anyways  Ruth asked me one day if I wanted to go on a drive with her to see her parents about 4 hours away and her kids she has two little kids. Ok so we had a good drive except I trauma dumped and talked way too much. (This has been normal in my family especially with us sisters we have all talked alot)She talked to and shared stuff but I definitely talked more. obviously I never got over the trauma of family situation that happened in my past. Well anyways it all went ok but Ruth has never asked me to do something like that again though she has asked me out for coffee to catch up( her sponcer duties) well at a hallows eve party last year I mentioned I had a good time on our drive/ trip to her husband and he said ""Ruth said you can talk for hours!) embarrassed I said something like oh yeah I do talk alot and he said do you know why? I think the conversation was interrupted from there. I've noticed Ruth seems agitated around me. We met for a conversation and she told me kindov abruptly that I need to learn the creed(preparing to be baptized) and that Father may not want to be my spiritual Father and I would need to ask Him. She repeated this twice. I said ok and Later asked Him. He readily agreed. Well sometimes I'll notice little quips from Ruth. Like My younger sister visited me from out of state and I told people and church she was visiting and how excited I was for them to meet her
My sister had said on the phone she wanted to come and see my church. But once she came she made excuses to not come(eventually she did come and likes it and wants to come again). I had mentioned it to Ruth who asked about her and I said yeah I'm not sure if she will end up coming but she said she would! Ruth said well I wouldn't come either I would just say no. In response to how I was being to pushy. I shut up real quick and immediately felt a depression come over me. I try so hard to people please and make sure everything is ok. She was right but I just felt so defeated. Before I left church that day I asked Father if we could meet. (I wanted to talk with Him about this.) we met and went on a walk I told Him about what Ruth has said and if I was in the wrong.He was a bit surprised this was what I wanted to talk about and told me He's not sure how exactly He can help,but I said I appreciate His opinion and think very highly of what He has to say. He said that I talk quite a lot and it may one of my passions and to work on that. We talked more and all and all it was a good conversation. I having anxiety texted him afterwards and apologized for keeping Him too long (I had lingered a bit longer talking asking questions after our meeting) and He reassured me all was well. Well anyways I went to service the next day and later He called me asking what it was that Ruth had said He and Ruth were on speaker phone with in the car and He was being lighthearted about it. I repeated what she said and reassured them that I appreciate her constructive criticism (which I do) she is not afraid to be herself or for the most part tell me like it is when it comes down to it. It was lighthearted conversation. I called Father later and asked if Ruth was offended( this was mainly me seeking reassurance) He assured me all was well and apologized He brought it up. Well anyways Father had given out his number for texting a while back and we often set up times to meet. I had some questions for upcoming baptism and He couldn't meet but He could answer the questions over textwhich was fine. Well anyways now I need to talk with Him about lent and fasting because I haven't been doing a good job of it. I'm not sure what exactly is expected of me as a catachumin and really I should have talked with Him about this before. My baptism is approaching and I've started smoking a bit again. I'm so depressed. Isolated from family and realizing I've started to make church family my real family. Father hasn't texted back yet for a time to meet and I texted Him after church this morning. It's been since this morning and I think he has usually responded quicker before like in several hours but not like the whole day goes by. I feel like he knows I'm needy and wants space? I don't know what to do I'm wanting to step back and let Him be the preist but I feel so alone and depressed. I've been excited to be baptized on Lazarus Saturday I feel like the demons are attacking me. I do know what to do I'm tired of feeling anxious all the time but I'm scared I'm being shut out.

Well, folks, after months of battling scope creep (aka procrastination), managing high-risk stakeholders (aka my anxiety), and executing countless study sprints, I can finally say… **I PASSED THE PMP!**

It was a brutal project. 
The budget? My sanity. 
The timeline? Constantly at risk. 
The resources? A mix of Andrew Ramdayal PMP Prep course , Mohamed Rahman Mindset Principles, ThirdRock’s Cheat Sheet and sheer willpower. 

Study Hall?
More like Stress Hall. But an amazing resource that helped me really prepare for the exam.

The exam itself felt like a high-stakes RAID meeting where I was the only one without an agenda. Every question had me second-guessing my existence—**“What would PMI do?”** became my new mantra. But somehow, against all odds (and with a lot of coffee), I made it through.

For anyone still grinding: trust the process, follow the framework, and remember— **Lessons Learned: Don’t Give Up!**

If you have any questions about the exam, study resources, or just need a pep talk, feel free to reach out. Happy to help!

Now, excuse me while I initiate the **“Celebrate & Recover”** phase of this project.

And of course, I wore blue for the exam and didn’t wanted to take any risks 😅

It feels like he has already fallen into a routine when it comes to spending time together.  In the 3 months we've been seeing each other we have spent the majority of out time at his house or mine. We have only actually been ""out"" 5 times. First date to dinner, second date bowling. Then a lot of time at his place because my kids are home. Only 3 other times we've actually been out and that was at my request and with my planning. Twice with other people.

So we see each other most often on the 2 days during week that my children see their dad for a few hours.  I have tried talking about things that interest me and he seems excited and always says let's plan. I'll send him links to activities.  But we don't seem to actually do anything.

The neon sign outside flickered over Route 66 in Gallup, New Mexico, casting a sickly glow through the window. It was 2 a.m., and the last trucker had just stumbled out, leaving a crumpled five-dollar tip. Nori’s feet ached, her apron sagged with loose change, and her life felt as stuck as the gum under the stools. Divorced a decade ago, her son now a mechanic in Albuquerque, she’d been slinging hash at the Desert Rose Diner for 15 years. Dreams? Those had dried up with the desert dust.

She locked up and trudged to her single-wide trailer a mile down the road, the stars sharp against the black sky. Inside, she kicked off her sneakers and collapsed onto the couch. A box in the corner caught her eye—one she hadn’t touched since the divorce. It was labeled ""Nori’s Stuff,"" scrawled in her ex-husband’s handwriting. Curiosity tugged at her exhaustion. She dragged it over, dust puffing into the air, and pried it open. Old Polaroids, a cracked mug, and there, at the bottom, her high school camera: a Canon AE-1, its leather strap brittle but intact. Memories flooded back—snapping photos of mesas at sunrise, winning a county fair prize at 17, dreaming of art school before life took over.

Looks to me like a triangle consolidation. The volume appears to have tapered off. Even within the consolidation, the volume looks stronger to the upside than the downside. 
 
An upside breakout here could be very interesting. 
 
We are still months away from next harvest… and the harvest is forecast to be quite low because of the bad weather in Brazil this year. 
 
Volcafe forecasts a deficit of 8.5 million bags for 2025-2026 crop year, wider than the 5.5 million bags deficit for 2024-2025.
 
Positioning has improved. Speculators peaked at 80k long contracts on Feb 03, 2025, but down to 56k long contracts as of last Friday. 
 
The market remains in backwardation. I’m seeing $3.91 for May, $3.85 for July, $3.78 for September, $3.68 for December, $3.59 for March 2026, $3.45 for May 2026, and $3.28 for July 2026. 
 
My fundamental long thesis has been revolving around Chinese demand. Fresh ground coffee is now 40% of demand in coffee, displacing some instant demand, and is forecast to reach 80%. 
 
The market, as expected, has been moving up the quality ladder, which should benefit Arabica over Robusta. 
 
Luckin Coffee now operates 22,000 stores in the country, with its famous 9.9 yuan pricing for a basic cup. They plan to expand into the rest of Southeast Asia. 
 
Cotti coffee has been a rapidly growing upstart. They now have 10,000 stores in China. They have an insane goal of opening 40,000 locations in the next 9 months, for a total 50,000 stores by the end of 2025. 
 
The Chinese demand wave in coffee has been a long time coming. I think we are on the steep part of the adoption curve here. 
 
In my process with commodities, I look for a fundamental thesis on supply and demand, confirmed by a technical picture. I look to buy a commodity in a deficit where I can forecast a growing deficit. I look to enter when positioning is not too crowded, or size small if positioning is overextended. I try to buy commodities in backwardation, and ideally buy a few months out, to benefit from the effects of “normal backwardation”. And I look to buy when I see a general commodity bull market.

My bf and I are both Asian 29M. I've been with my boyfriend for almost 13 years (this May will mark 13 years), and we've been in a long-distance relationship for 2.5 years. We both live and work abroad, so we rarely get to see each other. About 5-6 months ago, we went through a rough patch in our relationship and took a short break. He made an effort to mend things, and I agreed, trying to reconnect with him more. Things seem to be better now, but I still feel uncertain.

A few people have DMed me on IG and TikTok, and we’ve chatted as friends—nothing more. Last Sunday, I went for coffee with one of these friends, and we just talked about life in the country we're currently living in (we're from the same hometown back home). Before going, I told my boyfriend about it—I wasn’t hiding anything. But after I reposted a story with that friend, my boyfriend seemed upset. He then asked me to delete all the slightly ""thirst trap"" photos from my IG (don’t judge me—I enjoy working out, so I sometimes post pictures showing off my abs).

I’ve never crossed the line beyond friendship with anyone while being in a relationship with my boyfriend. This has been my first and only relationship. On one hand, I cherish it because how long it is, but on the other hand, I feel confused because my emotions seem to be fading, and I’m curious about other feelings.

Try a customized detox that's actually based on science, not trendy nonsense. Here’s a quick breakdown:

# What’s a Custom Detox Anyway?

* **Personalised Assessment:** Your naturopath or nutritionist will deep-dive into your habits, diet, and medical history—think therapy, but for your gut.
* **Diet Makeover:** Bye-bye processed foods and sugar; hello, fresh veggies, fruits, and fibre. Your fridge won't recognise itself.
* **Supplement Support:** Probiotics, antioxidants, or milk thistle might join the party to help detox pathways.
* **Lifestyle Tweaks:** More sleep, less stress, and regular yoga or meditation (yes, Netflix yoga counts).

# Detox Types to Choose From:

* **Liver Detox:** Give your liver a break—ditch alcohol and embrace broccoli, beets, and other veggies that your liver secretly loves.
* **Gut Detox:** Cut gluten, dairy, and high-FODMAP foods. Welcome fermented goodies like kimchi and sauerkraut. Your gut bacteria will cheer.
* **Heavy Metal Detox:** If mercury and lead scare you, specialized detox diets, chelation (supervised!), and binders help you safely evict these unwelcome guests.

# Perks of a Custom Detox (Spoiler: They’re Actually Good)

* **Energy Boost:** Less toxins = more energy. No promises you'll stop needing coffee, though.
* **Digestive Bliss:** Expect less bloating and happier digestion. Your jeans will thank you.
* **Radiant Skin:** Clearer skin without filters—imagine that!
* **Weight-Friendly:** Ditch processed snacks, naturally eat fewer calories, and reduce inflammation. Goodbye, stubborn pounds.
* **Immune Boost:** Balanced nutrition = stronger defenses. Germs, beware.
* **Fewer Cravings:** Break up with sugar and processed food. It’s not you—it’s definitely them.

**Important Note:** Always talk to a qualified healthcare provider before jumping into any detox plan. Your body deserves more than ChatGPT's or Googles opinion.",2,1742786593.0,NaturopathyAUS,0,1.0,False

And you don’t know me, but I’m a deeply melancholic person. Maybe because I always put myself in situations where I know I’ll end up missing something.

This all started because I was looking at pictures of summers back home. People from Spain may relate—beach summers.

I remember those days, and honestly, it’s hard to explain them to people who haven’t lived them because there’s nothing quite like a Mediterranean summer. The endless days, the long sobremesas, the sounds of clinking glasses and music blending from nearby tables, whole afternoons spent lying under the sun. Vermouth with chips and olives, cooking paella or carbonara at 30°C (yes, really). Then the post-beach shower to check tan lines, the siesta, shopping along the boardwalk, ice cream, waffles, wearing all white. Nights at clubs, drinking on the beach, fireworks. But also, evening walks with my family, braided hair, carnival rides on the Costa Brava.

I miss all of it so much. And that’s why I cherish every trip home.

People who have never lived away from home might not fully understand, but it’s such a strange feeling. What are you supposed to do when home is also here, in Chicago?

I’ve overthought this for years. Every year, the same thing. But I’ve finally made peace with it. My heart is split in two, and choosing one place over another doesn’t mean I’m leaving anyone behind. I’ve proven to myself that I can keep my people close, no matter where they are. And I’m so grateful for my mom, who picks up my calls even when it’s 2 a.m. back home, and for everyone who keeps track of Chicago time—yes, it’s a 7-hour difference.

My mom has been my biggest pillar in this journey, and I couldn’t be more grateful for her, my dad, my grandma, my siblings, and my childhood friends—the ones who still add me to birthday party group chats even though they know I won’t be there. Thank you.

I’ve learned to live in the present, to celebrate my wins here in Chicago, with the amazing people around me. I found my little piece of home here. They know things about me that I might never tell my friends back home, because our experiences are just different. And that’s okay. We get each other in this stage of life.

Sometimes, I think, wow, I’ve spent almost all of my 20s in Chicago. I have no clue how to buy a house in Spain, let alone find a job there. But I know that’s just another challenge that’ll help me grow, just like moving here did.

Coming from Spain—with its sun, beaches, Mediterranean lifestyle—to this city of skyscrapers and movie-like scenes felt like jumping off a cliff without knowing where I’d land. At first, it was terrifying. The streets were different, the pace of life was faster, the food… well.

But today, Chicago, you’re making me cry.

I know you better than my hometown, and for all the things that drive me crazy, you’ve given me so much to love. The neighborhoods, each with their own personality, just walking around, thrifting, hopping from one coffee shop to another. The Riverwalk, where you can just sit, talk, and watch the city move around you. I’ll never defend the CTA, but I’ll always stand by the bus.

I love waking up to see the sunrise over the lake or catching the sunset at the beach. Walking the lakefront, longboarding down the path with the skyline. Chicago summers are their own kind of magic—joining a random sports league just for the fun of it, being excited for the nice weather, afternoons after work at Wrigley Field. Taking the Metra to see friends in the suburbs, where life slows down just enough—bonfires, weekend trips to Michigan or Lake Geneva, camping. The festivals—the street fests, the food festivals, the fireworks.

I’m grateful for the people I’ve met from all over the world, who have become some of the most important people in my life.

Life here can be stressful—in an individualistic society where I constantly fight to stay true to myself. A lot of these struggles are invisible to others. Most people don’t understand what it’s like to leave everything behind and dive into the unknown. But those same struggles have shaped me in ways I never imagined.

What a ride—highs, lows, laughter, tears—but I wouldn’t change a thing. I deserve to celebrate myself, because I know how much I’ve fought for this.

My story, my experiences—they’ll live with me forever. And for that, I feel lucky.

But I feel ready now. After 8 years, it’s my time to leave.

Thank you, Chicago. Thank you, Spain.

The magic of home is that leaving feels great, but coming back feels even better.

I got laid off one month ago. I have been applying to 100+ jobs so far and tailored my resume based on JD, etc. Did not hear back from single company asking for a screening interview.

To be honest I felt so defeated and a couple weeks ago I started to reach out to everyone I know. I didn't want to reach out initially because I didn't want them to know I got laid off because, I guess I was ashamed by it? (it's a small industry)

Their advice was to reach out to people who are VP and up who has hiring power for which I don't have a direct connection always. (Basically 2nd degree connections). And they also said lots of jobs are posted these days are not real jobs; meaning they already have internal candidates therefore external people are not even considered, or some jobs aren't even posted as they have a waiting list of people who want to work there...

So I do need to get myself in that 'waiting list' queue and start to reach out to people that I am not that Any tips for this? Should I just send a LinkedIn message and be like I would like to have some sort of informational interview or coffee chat to learn more? ",2,1742786056.0,Layoffs,0,1.0,False

Hi, 
I have just found out them at my GF 36F off 18 months has lied to me about her relationship with her personal trainer. I am 38M He is a good friend of her brother. When we started going out she had been training with him for 6 months-ish. He was texting her asking her to go to samba classes and other activities. Weird I thought but glad she told me and I said “it is a bit weird but I get he is a friend. I would be uncomfortable but I wouldn’t deny her doing something like with friend. She denied that there was anything sexual between them. She was very firm that she saw him as a brother and nothing more. She got very defensive at times and said that she still wanted to continue to PT with him as she felt she hadn’t finished training etc - This PT has a massive reputation for sleeping with his clients and having affairs and freely admits that he doesn’t “do” relationships plus even my GF admits he flirts all the time. Weirdly keep hearing him saying that he “doesn’t sleep with clients”. Anyway, GF super keen I meet him on some socials with her brother to show what a great guy he was. Fast forward to the present, she drunkenly admitted to me that she did kiss him (before we met) and meeting up with him to discuss a training plan. She told me that they only kissed and nothing more and he didn’t want anything more than sex and she said she wanted a husband etc and said it would just be training. Obviously I feel betrayed at the lie - more so because she admitted the next day that she wouldn’t have told me they had kissed. Apparently, her brother and family were all aware of this kiss and even worse, I was at dinner with them way back at the start of our relationship and I said that I trusted her but I didn’t trust the personal trainer. They all said I could trust her. 
During the confession she told me that she has had 3 affairs with married men. 2 fairly recently in the past 5 years and has been faithful since our relationship started. She is still friendly with the first married man she had an affair with and still meets up for coffee every few months. The affair ended over 15 years ago (she did tell me at the start of our relationship about him but said he was just a. Friend and it wasn’t sexual). The other married man was friend of her brothers and her brother knew about it. I’m not sure on the details on the other affair. Other than she has blocked him as he was very persistent that their affair continued.
This has now made me move all my stuff out because I don’t feel I can trust her and feel betrayed and a fool for being oblivious to all of this plus I felt quite angry and just felt it better to give us both some space. I did try to keep my calm and hopefully got my point across that it’s not about the kiss (we weren’t even together) but that fact that she lied to me and didn’t seem to have wanted to tell me. I’m trying not to be judgemental about her past but I just keep seeing all these red flags and I’m really worried about what our future relationship is going to look like. 
I also worry about her family giving her terrible advice about not telling me. 
I feel I need to get her to break contact with her personal trainer and the married man. I was going to ask her for her view about these affairs (not sure if she was in a relationship at the time either). Was also thinking about couples counselling to provide a safe place to explore these issues. Any thoughts or ideas how I can proceed or should I just end it now. Am I overreacting? I was hoping to marry and have children with this woman…and it’s making me feel sick thinking through all the options.

1jihbpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/1jihbpq/absolute_spiderman/,Absolute Spider-Man,"We see Peter Parker waking up in his apartment looking at the time realizing he better get ready if he wants to got to class so Peter showers gets dressed making sure he has everything he needs while walking out of his apartment he thinks to himself ""Another day of the old Parker luck hopefully I still have it or maybe this is the day it will run out but so far seems ok"". While walking he made it to esu front entrance he sees his best friend Harry Osborne. 

Harry: ""Pete on time again wow you're close to breaking the record for perfect attendance how do you do it""? 

Peter: ""Just the old Parker luck Harry never once let be down always there when I need it""

Harry: ""Very cocky bud I'll give you that just wait until the day that you'll be late for once"" 

Peter: ""Pfft me late I highly doubt that Parker’s are known to not give up especially when it comes to having responsibilities"" 

Harry: ""Hmm I'll take some notes but hey without your luck I wouldn't be able to do great in class Pete"" 

Peter: ""I wouldn't call it luck Harry more like helping my friend passing his classes because that's what friends do for each other"" 

Harry: ""Fair point I mean we did grew up together you me and Eddie we had great times together he was kinda like a big brother to us"" 

Peter sighs : "" Yeah I wish we knew what happened to him he was always good at brighten the mood"" 

Harry: ""Me to pal it hasn't been easy through this semester without Eddie but I'm sure his ok I mean the guy use to workout remember"" 

He looks at his watch saying that they should be heading to there class before they are late now both Peter and Harry reached there class going inside taking a seat getting ready for the lecture. 

Peter looking spots Felicia the girl who's been on his mind when he first started in college Harry notices and says. 

Harry: "" Come on just ask her out already you literally bean staring at her for a while now"" 

Peter responses: ""It's not easy as it looks my friend trust even my Parker luck won't work on her or any girl for that matter""  

Harry chuckles a bit: "" Pete let your buddy Harry tell you about the ladies they ain't gonna come to you that's not how it goes you gotta go to them before some other dude tries to go for it himself it's very simple"" 

Peter rolls his eyes: ""Thanks for putting it in my head I'll be sure to tell my therapist that I imagine the girl I like is with another guy"" 

Harry replies in a jokey way: "" anytime buddy I'm always here"" 

The two laugh when the professor comes in and tells the class to be silent getting ready to teach them the subject today. 

""For new comers in this class let me introduce myself I am Professor Otto Octavius some of you already know who I am and how I teach my students I expect everyone to be at there very best do I make myself clear"" 

Everyone in the classroom says yes

Prof Oct: ""Ok today we will be learning about different types of energy the very thing the world needs the most but sometimes it can either be a good thing or a bad thing that's why we are trying to find ways to make it pure no effects nor problems a way to control it without issues""

While writing notes down Peter glimpse at Felicia thinking maybe Harry is right maybe he should just go for it I mean what's the worst that can happen unless she rejects him in a bad way than maybe his screwed. 

Prof Ock: ""Mr Parker I hope you dozing off means you're focusing on what I'm trying to teach"" 

Peter snaps out of it: ""Uh..ye.yes professor Octavius I was just really in the zone on the energy thing"" he laughes nervously.

Prof Ock: ""Very well alright everyone that is enough for today remember to study for your final next week remember this test will be your last grade and if you do well you'll pass this class I wish all of you the best of luck"" 

Before leaving Octavius ask Peter if he could have a word with him for a bit. 

Harry whispers: ""Welp it looks like your luck might run out nice knowing you bud""

Peter: ""Let's hope not, Hi professor Octavius sorry about the dozing off part just been a lot on my mind and ""

Prof Oct cuts him off: ""I understand Peter but I just wanted to make sure you're focused your a great student top of the class which is very impressive just don't want it to go to waste you have the chance to make something of yourself remember that"" 

Peter replies: ""I know professor don't worry nothing is gonna stop me from doing my best""

He leaves the classroom seeing Harry waiting for him outside 

Harry: ""Well well did the old Parker luck finally run out please leave nothing out"" 

Peter: ""It's still there pal"" Peter being funny. 

Harry: "" Damn it so close guess another bites the dust"" 

Peter: ""Seems so Harry hope you didn't bet on me unless you want the wrath of Norman Osborne"" 

Harry: ""Very funny Pete if the science thing doesn't work out you could always be a comedian anyway at least that was our only class for today thank god"" 

Peter: ""Until tomorrow when we have Professor Tooms for engineering class"" 

Harry grunts: ""That guy is pretty creepy his kinda like a vulture but hey at least we are close to the semester ending and it's nothing but freedom"" 

Peter: ""True at least it gets me time to go to work more and earn some money"" 

Harry: "" Dude how can you love work I'm surprised you aren't bored of it especially having doing the same thing everyday"" 

Peter simply replies: ""Well living in New York isn't cheap Harry plus I enjoy what I do I'm not exactly struggling my life is pretty much going well so far sure it can be difficult sometimes but I was always taught to not give up so that's what I do""

Harry: ""Ok I get it you really sound like you're aunt and uncle""

Peter: ""Hey they aren't wrong they always knew how to give good advice well I gotta get going can't be late for work"" 

Harry: ""Oh please you being late is when pigs fly buddy the way your going I'm sure everything will be fine I'll talk to you later Pete""

They both said goodbye to each other walking away while on his way to work he sees Felicia sitting waiting for the bus to come Peter didn't know what to do should he just walk another way or stay quiet unless Peter should just listen to Harry's advice although it sounds like something he would maybe he can just be himself.

Peter waving his hand: ""Hey Felicia"" 

Felicia turns around: ""Hey Peter I see the prize student comes before me"" 

Peter nervously: *oh yeah uh I don't really see myself as anyone special I just do what I have to do college isn't exactly a picnic*

Felicia smiles: well at least your doing good me not so much it hasn't been easy for me and my mom"" 


Peter: ""I'm sorry to hear that at least your trying your best that's what counts the most""

Felicia: ""I know it's just my whole life felt like I haven't been so lucky no friends I'm pretty much an outcast people would call me black cat cause I bring some type of bad luck my mom is going through a lot to ever since my father went to jail for robbing some guy who ran a wrestling show now she works double shift just to pay for my tuition I work part-time in a animal shelter mostly with cats"" 

Peter with a little sadness on his face and showing his caring side: ""You know if you need help with school work or need someone to talk I'm always here I understand life is hard but there's hope for you to be better than who you're father was it's never bad to ask for help"" 

Felicia: ""Thanks Peter I guess it's a date than I'll see you around""

Peter pauses: ""yeah sure wait what""

After the little chat between them Peter kept walking to work finally making it to Parker industry using his card to enter inside and head to his office after getting settled he begins to checking on some results when he hears someone call his name. 

""Peter on time again I'm glad you were able to come in today I was worried something might have happened you could have called"" 

Peter: I'm fine nothing to worry about I'm not a little kid anymore Dad"" 

Richard P: ""No matter how old you are I'm your father it's my job to worry son how was class today"" 

Peter: ""It was good Harry was his usual self and we have a final next week he can't wait for break neither can I you won't be alone to do the work by yourself"" 

Richard P: ""Just like his father just more into business than socializing back than he was still trying to prove to be the superior one but eh Norman was always liked that"" 

Peter: ""I'm surprised you're still friends with him kinda seems like very secretive guy"" 

Richard P: ""Norman can be like that sometimes especially running a company he even wanted us to start together but there was some questionable things I'll tell you about it later""

The news come on the TV the reporter says: ""Another gang has been stop by the vigilante known as Spider-Man this past year this masked man has stop one crime after another little is known about this vigilante some say his a hero while others think his a menace the debate is still going on about this meanwhile theses gangs numbers has increased Hammerhead,Tombstone and Sliver Maine in a all out war overwhelming the police trying to do there best to push them back so far nothing has worked Captain Stacey had this to say""

Captain Stacey: ""All I can is that we are trying our very best to stop this gang war all we ask is for the people in New York to be patient with us I promise you will never have to fear these monsters""

Another reporter: "" what about the vigilante spider man his been also handling the gangs as well"" 

Captain Stacey: ""who ever this Spider-Man is must realize that we are the law that we don't need a spider masked vigilante interfering with police business we'll deal with these punks ourselves if his seen by us he will be arrested on site"" 
 
TV reporter: ""As you can see the police will keep doing there best to stop this gang war from cause more chaos I'm Betty Brent of channel one news signing of""

Richard P turns off the TV: ""What’s this world coming to first gangs now a vigilante I'm not really a big fan of this Spider-Man but it's whatever"" 

Peter smiles replies: ""I don't know dad he seems pretty cool especially the costume""

Richard P confused on Peter’s comment 

Peter: ""Just an opinion""

Richard P: ...Right well don't work to much Peter don't forget to lock up and shut down everything before you leave we are having dinner in Ben and May's place tonight don't forget"" 

Peter: ""I won't I promise I'll be there"" 

His father leaves the room while Peter looks at the cameras to make sure nobody is around to see him now in his father's lab he opens up a case revealing his suit after putting it on Peter swings around the city thinking to himself. 

Spider-Man(thoughts): ""These gangs are starting to get bigger but hey since the semester is coming to an end I'll have more time to go after them I always saw superheroes fighting crime on TV I'll admit it's a bit challenging sometimes especially since these guys are maniacs"" 

Spider-Man notices some gang members stealing some high tech weaponry so he decides it needs to be stop he jumps and lands on the floor adds a quip.

Spider-Man: ""Hey guys how's everyone doing you know if you wanted something the gift shop is over there they got shirts,cups hoodies but guns I think you have to be a certain age to play with those"" 

Gang member says:"" kill this freak"" 

Aiming there guns at him firing at Spider-man quickly dodges the coming rounds knocking them out one by one.

Spider-Man: ""Guys come on can we just talk about it maybe get some coffee getting to know each other""

Another gang member: ""get the magna gun""

One member gets the gun and blast it at Spider-man he quickly evades the blast realizing that these weapons are way more advanced than he thought he was able to take the blaster and use it to destroy the rest of the weapons the rest of the members were defeated grabbing one of them. 

Spider-Man: ""Alright let's play tell me what's Tombstone planning to use these weapons for if you say the right answer you win the prize jail time"" 

Gang member says: ""I ain't telling you nothing"" 

Spider-Man drops him than catches him to scare him: ""you better hurry my arm is getting tired"" 

Gang member: ""Ok ok it's to even the fight against Hammerhead and Sliver Main these guys love to fight crazy so we wanted to do the same that's all I know I swear""

Spider-Man:""See that wasn't so hard hmm now I gotta figure out were these weapons are coming from"" 

Suddenly he gets hit with a blast sending him to a wall feeling dizzy saying maybe he should go on vacation next time. 

""Well look what we have here Spider-Man I've always wanted to see you in person now I think I just hit the jackpot"" 

Spider-Man man sigh: ""And people say my costume sucks buddy I don't know who you're tailor is but you need to get a refund mister""!?

Shocker: ""Boy you can call me Shocker Mr H knew you would be a problem luckily he got the right man for the job""

Spider-Man: ""Great I really did jinx myself today look pal I gotta be somewhere soon so let's wrap this up yes""

Shocker: ""Oh your going somewhere alright hell"" 

he releases a shock wave at him Spider-Man is able to get out of the way in time shooting his webs trying to wrap up Shocker but just breaks them easily the two give each other blows the fight lasting a while. 

Shocker: ""Just give up bug there's no way this will end so why not make my job easier and hold still""

Spider-Man: ""I got a better idea"" breaks his wrist gauntlets "" so what were you saying"" 

Shocker:""What no this can't be this ain't over web head next time I'll get my cha!? 

Webs his mouth shot and leaving him for the police he swings away hoping to make it on time which he kinda does but the Parker luck had to run out Peter apologize for being late and of they said it was ok and sat down having dinner. 

Uncle Ben: ""It's good to see you again Peter haven't visited me and may for a while""

Aunt May: ""Oh Ben remember he works and goes to college that's very time consuming""

Peter: ""Sorry guys sometimes when I'm doing to much I forget I promise to visit more""

Uncle Ben: ""Don't worry about it kiddo just hope you're dad isn't working to hard""

They all started to laugh 

Mary P: ""Don't worry Richard and Peter love to work hard especially for science and all that nerd stuff"" 

Richard P: ""If I remember correctly you fell in love with a nerd and had a great child who's also a nerd like his old man so either way it's a win"" 

Peter: Come on guys I'm right here plus being nerd is pretty cool nothing wrong with it 

Richard P: ""That's my boy see Mary it's cool""

Mary P: ""If you say so just warning you mister our son is a nerd cause of you but hey I'm glad either way my son is passing his classes in college we are very proud of you Peter""

Peter smiles: ""Thanks Mom""

After dinner Peter went to throw the garbage out than uncle ben decided to help him out after finishing up the two talked. 

Uncle Ben: ""You came a long way Peter to become the man I always knew you would be""

Peter: ""Thanks Uncle Ben but there's something I wanted to ask if you had power should it be used for helping others or yourself"" 

Uncle Ben: ""Well son that all depends on person or you power is what you choose to do with it as long as you are responsible for it than your path is clear""

Peter: ""Yeah I understand it just feels if I wanna help others they don't see it that way""

Uncle Ben smiles: "" Peter in a world like this there are others who may see you as a nobody nut what's important is how you feel it doesn't matter what others think as long as you know who you are and do the best you can your a great man Peter never change that understand""

Peter: ""Yeah I think I do thanks Uncle Ben for the advice"" 

Uncle Ben: I'm glad champ I'm going back inside I'll see you in the house and Peter remember with great power comes great responsibility remember that"". 

Ben goes inside Peter follows shortly after meanwhile in an abandoned train yard where Tombstones has his meeting with his gang 

Gang member: ""Sorry boss the weapons were destroyed and Shocker got caught it was by that Spider-Man"".

Tombstone in the shadows: ""So in other words you failed"" 

Gang member: ""Boss no it was just""

Tombstone grabs his neck snapping it dropping his body on the floor.

Tombstone: ""This is what happens when you fail me it seems I've underestimate this Spider-Man he could be a threat to everything I built unless he would make a great ally against Hammerhead and Sliver Maine Beetle ""
Beetle: You have a job for me Mr H 

Tombstone: ""Yes I want you to keep tabs on this vigilante for now until I decide what must be done Spider-Man can really help us with our issue""

Beetle: ""What if he refuses""

Tombstone with an evil smile: ""End him""

1jihbfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1jihbfg/new_cat_pouncing_on_resident_cat/,New cat pouncing on resident cat,"We got a new cat (2.5M) 2 months ago from a local rescue, where he lived for a year surrounded by lots of other cats. Our resident cat (6F) has been an only cat the entire time we’ve had her (~5 years) so we expected there would be a decently long adjustment period.  We have followed the Jackson galaxy intro system and each cat gets a good amount of their own, separate space (new cat gets all of upstairs essentially). They eat meals on opposite sides of a baby gate, interactions have always been paired with food and play etc. Because they’ve been doing pretty good overall, I’ve started doing more supervised interactions where I play with both of them separately and break up staredowns with toys and treats. A couple of weeks ago I had to end the interaction when new cat pounced on resident cat, who had let her guard down (slow blinks). I’ve walked things back and done smaller interactions again always with food etc. 

The past couple of days they were doing good! And just now I let new cat out into the main living space while resident cat was resting on the sofa. When she saw him, she growled signaling she wants to be left alone and he listened. He explored and we played (he’s very high energy) and eventually he looked sort of like he was chilling out under our coffee table. However, he was staring at resident cat and it was hard to break his gaze with play. Resident cat was half asleep and had clearly felt like she could let her guard down…. And then new cat jumped up on the sofa and swatted at her. They started hissing and fighting in a similarly if not more violent way than the first incident, and I threw a blanket over new cats head and took him to his space upstairs. I’m not sure what to do next aside from starting the introduction process over. Resident cat was relaxed and had been successfully drawing new cats energy and attention with play, yet he still chose to attack her.

So I got the recipe from: https://thebigmansworld.com/keto-ice-cream/

I totally recommend his recipes, btw! Check out his keto popcorn - life changers!

Anyways.. I made that and I also bought Coolway keto chocolate ice cream and realized that it tastes the same.

However I didn’t have an ice cream maker and the version I made wasn’t properly churned so it was just hard. 

Instead of dealing with that I started making almond milk ice cubes and adding them to the blender when I make myself a protein powder shake. I choose a stevia sweetened protein powder that is chocolate cake flavor. I add a pinch of xantham gum and a spoon of peanut butter. In total I add 240ml of almond milk (half ice cubes, half liquid).

It has been the best meal of my days, cause I am crazy about frozen treats.

I decided to get myself an ice cream maker and today I blended my usual shake ingredients but I poured them into the ice cream maker and I made myself the best PB Chocolate keto friendly ice cream EVER! Ahh I added a tbsp of powdered erythritol and monk fruit.

If you have an ice cream maker, you gotta try this!

Yes. I've posted this photo in comments a few times. I think it's time to take an honest look at these beans. They were roasted by a local Italian-American family who've been in the roasting business for over 90 years.   
  
Even if you have the most expertly dark roasted beans, brewing them like a light roast just won't work. If you put darker beans through the longer shots at higher temperatures, as you would with your latte-colored beans, you're going to extract far too much, over cooked solids. This will result in a bitter, burnt, ashy cup full of alkaloids and undesirable phenolic compounds.  And wouldn't you know it,  that's exactly the general complaint made by the weekly anti-dark-roast posts full of third wave bandwagoneer upvotes.

The other common complaint is that such dark, oily roasts are to be blamed for clogging grinders. I have two grinders: one crappy cone and a DF54 flat burr.  I've almost exclusively used the beans you see above in my DF54 for a whole year, 2-4 shots per day, and the thing remains amazingly clean. The two times I've opened it up to clean it, the only thing that needed cleaning were the holes where the screws go to secure the burrs. Otherwise, it literally remains shiny. In full disclosure, the cone burrs never remained as clean, but they also never came anywhere near clogging.

From reading the complaints, it would seem that people who relish dark roast bashing do not understand how to properly brew it and I suspect that they do not actually like traditional, Italian-style espresso, and maybe even the flavor of coffee itself.  *And that's fine*. It's just not very smart nor useful to go on and on about what you've heard but don't really know enough about.

Are there beans that look like this that are not properly roasted and/or brewed, and will taste like a campfire no matter what you do? Of course. That's Starbucks' purpose for existing.  But, I promise, properly dark roasted beans, properly brewed will give you a deep, dark, rich, cacao experience on its own as a cup of espresso, and make your milk drinks burst with a coffee richness that no reasonable amount of milk can erase.",1,1742785453.0,espresso,15,0.54,False

I shot an email to my favorite local place, we had a good long informal interview, and I was hired on the spot. I was so excited to be a barista and have been there for just over 6 months; I learned how to make all the drinks and memorized the food menu in about 2 months. It’s my first service job of this kind and I’m really proud of my growth. 

Now, I’m ready to quit.

The biggest issue is the owner, not to be confused with our awesome manager. The owner has and has had a lot of health and mobility issues since opening the place, and I must commend them for still trying to run the business despite it all. But it’s no excuse for their practices. 

Comments about our employee’s weights (all of our baristas are young women). Using Italian roast (or dark if we’re out) instead of an espresso blend. Allows dogs in the building against health code. Only scheduling two people on days we’re supposed to be busy to save money on payroll (we need 3). Asked them about my raise when I became a keyholder and replied “you’re a keyholder now?” Puts the manager on the floor and then gets mad at them for not doing manager tasks. Taking coffee from the airpots, “killing it” with no effort to start a new pot and/or taking coffee for themself and walking away while there’s a line to the door. I could go on.

What really did it for me was when they allowed a man into the shop - the one who was “banned” for s****lly harassing a 19 y/o female employee - with no warning and genuine confusion as to why my coworker and I looked so panicked when he entered. I asked why he came in and they ended their explanation with “he made a mistake that was sensationalized.” Yep.

Our longest-serving barista is about to leave. I’m leaving soon and I know another barista with plans to leave. My manager is most likely leaving at the end of April. Did I mention we only have a whopping 5 baristas right now? That’s how bad it is. I’ve heard of shitty owners in places like this but find it hard to believe there’s worse out there (and I’m SO sorry if you’ve experienced worse). 

It makes me sad to think I once genuinely enjoyed the work I was doing and the service I was providing, now my other baristas and I are miserable when we show up to work. We’ve all formed a tight bond over this experience, but it sucks all my energy and just doesn’t feel worth it to stick around anymore.

Hey there! This is my first time on this reddit, but I'll try to write out enough information for readers to get a good idea of me. 

If you're TLDR: If you lack sleep, but love to just hang out and talk for long hours without judgement, joke around, or even discuss deep topics-I'm probably your guy! I'm pretty smart!  One important thing I also wanna mention though. I'm looking for people who 'actually' seek genuine friendship though. Not 'greet, then never remeet' like a buffet. Look, if we don't get along, it's all good. But at least be 'trying', ya know. I'm not too big a fan of shallow circles-Quality beats quantity! Friendship is a two way street. 



That out the way...!



About my character: I'm near impossible to offend, so if you're a joker, it's totally fine and welcome. If not, and you love to talk about deeper subjects, that's also welcome and fine. If you're shy or insecure, but wanna branch out and learn more about people-you're more common than you know! I'm American but have traveled and lived over a decade literally around the world; from Asia, to Europe, to the Middle East-so I have tons of stories to tell or even traveling advice is you want! I've probably been to close to 12 countries or more.

  
I love Japan and Japanese culture! Even the weeby stuff. I can talk about anime, but don't expect me to know 'so' many. I mostly just watched the older stuff like .Hack/Sign, Cowboy Bebop, Naruto Shippuden, Violet Evergarden, Your Lie in April, Ghost in the Shell, Samurai Champloo, out the top of my head. I've watched some dramas, both J-Drama and K-Drama, and 'anime movies' as well. If you wanna show me stuff to watch together and talk about, just know I'm picky, but if it's good I'll watch it! Haha

Personally wise, I can be amazingly funny (Depending how high your tolerance is!). I can keep a convo rolling, and also spark them fine and well, so long as the conversation has a form of reciprocation. (Don't be an utter potato-partial one's are acceptable though!) Do you like conversations even outside just the current games were playing? How about Gaming Theory and Philosophy or even Philosophy itself? Or life!Want to learn people? I'm (mostly!) good with them! I can be a shoulder to lean on or learn from, so long as we don't go down TOO negative lane on a daily basis, ya know. Sometimes is alright though!



The reason you see I made what 'actual' game titles 'generic' is because, what's coop, I've mostly grown tired of. (CURRENTLY, anyways. Hopefully newer, more interesting ones we can play together will release in the future. Gaming market is pretty, oof, these day, ya know?) I've done a LOT of League of Legends-my heart can't take anymore! I also played FFXIV for YEARS. I was deep into the RP community too! Second most recent was Throne and Liberty, but I burnt through all the content and left during the drought. Granblue Fantasy Relink-also ran through the content! Latest has been MONSTER HUNTER WILDS! Love the game-but waiting on next tier difficulty drop! If you're really into it, I don't mind logging in for a few hunts though. Just know I won't be as passionate since I farmed everything haha. 

  
These days I'm just buying random games on Steam. Lately has been Assassin's Creed Shadows. Before that has been Trails of Dawnbreak II, Final Fantasy Rebirth...(I still need to beat Final Fantasy Rebirth.) And there is a massive list of unfinished just...sitting there. If you have games you like to stream and talk during, wanna watch mine, or just wanna vibe, it's all good.

Games close to my heart: Nier series-and ELDEN RING! Yes. Now I'm also waiting on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Stellar Blade, and Elden Ring NIGHTREIN (WE CAN PLAY THIS TOGETHER)

Reese sadfishes, flirts with a new man and apologizes to her viewers


Reese went live at a flea market in Nashville today and a guy named Adam wanted to say hello to her and her stream. He's very tall and Reese is making it obvious to her chat that she's flirting with him. She touches him and then says ""You don't mind if I touch you, do you?"" Reese is a hypocrite because she has told her chat many times that no one should touch another person without getting permission first. She tells him she's turned on by having to look up at him. She asks if Adam was attracted to her by her smell and then he leans over and smells her. He's not married and she's delighted by that.

Reese's friend and frequent chatter AngieMo comes on camera to say hi to Adam. Reese says she forgot that AngieMo was with her. So rude. Reese goes to hug Adam and take a picture with him and AngieMo says Reese has found a boyfriend. Reese asks him if she's too chubby. They exchanged phone numbers. She keeps patting him repeatedly. Then Reese and AngieMo walk away and talk about Adam. Reese says she didn't ask him if he's a virgin because that would be depressing. ""I think he would be a nice friend to have,"" she says.

Then Adam shows up in Reese's chat and Reese tells him that it's weird that his birthday is on New Year's Eve. That's when she and Tommy fell in love and then when they got engaged. She says she felt very safe and calm around Adam.

She shows a pink cast-iron furniture set and starts raving about how cute it is and says she wants it. The bench from that set costs $125 and then she tells her chat that she doesn't know how to bargain. Then the seller says that the whole set would cost $200. People send her enough superchats to pay for the set but then Reese tells AngieMo to try to get an even lower price from the seller.

Reese says she might go to a gun show because it would be a good place to meet men.

She does another livestream from her house later. She said at the flea market that anytime she feels sad or depressed, she can just get on a livestream and hundreds of people will jump on and help her feel better.

A chatter tells Reese she's been waiting for Reese to answer her email and she's starting to think that Reese won't do it. Reese says she's just really behind on answering emails and that no one should be offended if it takes her a long time to answer them.

She says she thinks she scared Adam already. If Reese didn't, her chat probably did. Her chatters were really prying for more information about him. She says she was wearing the expensive perfume that a frequent chatter gave her so she smelled really good. Reese keeps promoting that perfume but doesn't tell her chat that if they buy that perfume from her YouTube link that she gets a commission on it.

She says she texted Adam twice and then started panicking that he didn't remember her. Then he texted her back after a few hours. She's reading their texts back and forth, which is rude. She tells Adam he has no expectation of privacy because they met on a livestream. She says she thinks it's great that he works a lot and isn't home much. Reese should remember that even when Jeff worked from home, she continually pestered him multiple times a day for affection and assurance.

Reese says she knew that Tommy was going to make money by selling his YouTube channel to an AI company. She says if she were motivated by money she just would have stayed with him. She says if she came into a bunch of money tomorrow, she would never tell her YouTube channel about it. Reese says she didn't announce when Jeff gave her money after their divorce. Of course she didn't. She talked about Jeff owing her that money continuously and made people worry for her financially but she didn't share the good news when he paid her.

Reese says she has found out more shocking things about Tommy and that she's very glad she got away from him. She says it's time to move on from him. She says she's sorry to everyone because she feels like she and Tommy both let their viewers down. ""It was a fairy tale for all of us,"" she says, adding that many of her fans are still having a very hard time getting over the breakup. ""I had everything to do with that bomb going off,"" she says. She claims she doesn't want to talk about Tommy anymore.

Reese says she appreciates everyone who has stuck with her through a lot of bullshit and she insists that she doesn't want to be destructive anymore.

She says she's going to meet for breakfast or coffee with the woman who owns the cafe where she streamed several days ago, adding that the woman likes Reese's channel and that she recently lost her husband.

And I woke up not as sad, but still a heavy feeling.

I'm imagining the last time I'll get to see her in person. The last time I get to touch her, hear her, and even smell her.

The last time her shadow would hug mine.

The last time I get to tell her a good joke, remind her of a funny story we both experienced, the last time I get to ask her about her day in front of me or beside me or while eating or drinking coffee, wasting time together.

The last time I get to ask her out, the last time I get to take her for granted.

I'm imagining giving her parting gifts.

A Rattan bag, because she loves that kind of material. I figured I'd give her a new one in case she needs a spare but I'll have it custom made with her nickname or initials, maybe sunflowers because she loves sunflowers as earrings or necklaces.

A new pair of running or walking shoes because she loves walking to places instead of paying for a ride hailing service. She thinks walking 2 km at 4 pm in humid weather isn't a terrible idea. I also saw her last pair had signs of stitching and repairs since 60 days ago and I couldn't forget about it.

She already has a mug I bought her for Christmas from a famous coffee shop in a mountain region. Maybe I'll also gift her coffee beans so she can have the first month of her new life with good coffee from home.

And every minute of that last day would be heavy, as if my smiles and laughters were lifting hundreds of pounds. As if my eyes had their tearducts glued shut, so tears won't come out.

Every small hug we have, forcefully controlled so my arms wouldn't tighten around her, and so I wouldn't shake, so I would let her go.

I would wish that last day or night to not end. I would internally scream ""please stay please stay please stay"" as I wish her good luck and take care just before I leave her.

And it will be the most depressing time of my life.

Having met the most amazing, adventurous, smart, funny, and purpose driven woman when I was already prepared to try love again, and be visibly, forcefully, so damn happy that she's going to have a life without me.

Because that's the most mature thing I could do and that's what I want her to remember me as, not some desperate idiot clinging onto a relationship that never had time to even simmer or sprout from the ground.

The saddest days I'll have, then, would be her leaving and her coming back, because I'm now afraid of seeing someone else make her happy in my stead, even though I know for a fact that at the same time I should want it.

I couldn't give her the peace and comfort she demanded, and as much as I want to try again, I'm not sure if she'll even entertain the thought, the thought of me.

Me, randomly telling her about my day and her replying with the dumbest looking gifs and memes. Me asking about how she is, what her weekend was like, and her telling me it's all mundane so I try to make her laugh digitally.

Or me being unsure about living on my own, and her reassuring me that I could do it because she did it after running away from home with barely any money, and I had lots of it with a supportive family.

So I moved out because she believed in me, and so I can hang out with her more because my new place would be nearer or at least be more accessible thanks to the MRT and her being 15 minutes from SM North.

The irony is just when I moved closer, that's when our hearts grew apart. One misunderstanding, one misinterpretation, text lost in digital translation, and it killed the soil where the seeds of our deep friendship were hastily thrown and clumsily watered and grown.

She said she didn't want anything serious, and I reassured her it wasn't; that I saw her as a little sister.

That was the truth at the time. I was always honest with her. I saw her as this intimate friend who knows my secrets and skeletons, until she said she's not planning on returning.

Right now I do love her. I'm now sure of it. I didn't think much of it first, that maybe this is just some infatuation that I shouldn't take seriously in my 30s.

Now that I am certain my days with her are numbered, and it will all be so damn hastily spent with me begging for more time before we end our time together.

Our little first date, a random friendly hangout, a French movie that made me see a woman giving birth in 4k and coffee dinner.

It started with an out of the blue 3:30 pm text and my reply that said ""I'll be there by 6"" not because I wasn't eager, but because Metro Manila traffic from my real address grounded me in reality. I rushed and made it just 5 minutes prior.

I may not have peace in the coming days, weeks, months. Maybe not even after she leaves. However, I trust myself enough to move forward but in pain, with a heart that's burdened by the weight of what could be the biggest what if of my life.

I'm now thinking of maybe pursuing her in Ireland, or maybe trying to stay connected as much as I can, and maybe go there even for just a month to be a good friend again.

Her ""senor Robertoo"" she rants with, the always busy friend she calls at 1 am because she's having a panic attack and me stopping my world so I can help hers turn.

But that's all in the future, a place I dread to visit knowing one thing that will happen.

All I know is, I have to work harder, so she'll see that I'm doing well, that I'm also just as ambitious as her.

That I'm not a loser. That I'm still the same man who was so good at his craft that her eyes couldn't help but be fixated with mine, as I told her about random food facts, supplements, and weight loss science or trivia about coffee, our favorite drink.

She hates her eyes because of her Graves disease, with how bulged they are (only a tiny bit), but I adored them from the very first night they saw mine. I told her:

""I like your eyes. They glow when looked at. When you were asking me about random food stuff and I was looking at them, it felt like you were looking at my soul.""

She replied:

""Whoa, yeah. I get too intense sometimes. Did you feel na I was hounding you for answers?""

I said:

""I wouldn't call that intense. More like I get lost in them. Parang ganun.""

Her:

""Sometimes I feel like I scare people off.""

And me:

""If people are scared of you being curious, then that's on them.""

It was in that bar in Intramuros, as we were having a quick break after 2 hours of walking with a tour group last November. I went behind the counter, pretended to be a barista and asked her ""so, what can I get you"" and I leaned across the table to meet her gaze and smile and curiosity.

That was the first time I saw her. I didn't pay attention at first, but I knew I loved talking to her. I was attracted by how she was amazed at ideas and facts I found dull or ""everyday.""

The night after, I said she should join us at a year end pool party because I found her fun to hang around with.

Little did I know that was the beginning of something happy, with an ending that's tragic for me, but the very best for her.

In the end, I thought I was the hero of this movie, but it was her autobiography after all, and I'm just the character whom the audience will feel sad about.

The other guy in the movie. The main guy wasn't me, but I was the one who was there while main guy wasn't even in the script or the trailer or the books.

Hopefully, I make the audience proud, too.",1,1742784831.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

She said yes but it would have to be after spring break since she was leaving the next day. Throughout the week we had been texting and the convos seemed to be going really well. The only problem is she takes forever to respond, sometimes a day. She even posted some pictures on Instagram early in the day one time and only responded at night. It seems pretty obvious that she’s not interested anymore however when she does respond, she continues the convo well and asks thoughtful questions back, which is why I am kind of confused.

Storytime on how I’ve been arguing with a guy I met there for 2 weeks now. 😞” we listen we don’t judge “,"Ok so I matched with a guy there 2 weeks ago and we have been combative and toxic 😫 before we have actually even linked. Right now we are absolutely not meeting and we’ve blocked each other on social media and contacts. How we got there ? Because we are both crazy obviously and too alike it’s scary. We started off strong like conversation , chemistry and all. The first thing we kind of got into a back and forth about is us meeting up. He said that he wanted to meet me for coffee and then go back to his place. I said coffee ..sure but going to his place no. Now we are both on the same page about what we are looking for currently which is fwb, however I stated I wanted to be friends first and the benefits come after. Essentially getting to know each other , learn if we actually like the other on a friend level before fwb. I told him I wanted something consistent and that’s closed off meaning we exclusively are sleeping with each other. He agreed to everything he had been celibate for the past 7 months and he’s very selective and everything sounds what he’s looking for. But he’s like why can’t you come over after coffee and I’m basically letting him know it’s because I’m not doing anything sex wise and I don’t want it to lead further. He’s like so what’s even the point of us linking. 😭 so I reminded him then and there about what I just explained I’m looking for and if it’s not something he wants we can just part ways no bad blood. He’s like no it’s cool I understand. After that we just keep butting heads about little things and I’ll admit im used to being in control and so is he so we clashed. But we really wanted to see it through. We ended up getting into it real bad and he blocked me. So I messaged him on Instagram 🥴 and of course he responds and unblocked me. By the way he’s very sassy, but idk I guess we got addicted to the conversations outside of us butting heads and what could be’s. But today it came crashing down when we got into a 3 hour argument over me linking with someone last week. So recall he blocked me , we didn’t speak for days until I messaged him on Instagram and he unblocked me. In between that time I linked with another guy I met on bumble. I told him about it when we started back talking (today ) and he went off and started calling me everything under the sun. But it’s this toxic cycle of arguing and then making up which we like too much. I told him he was  sadistic and he said I was a masochist which I believe has some truth to it. But everything he said stung and it keeps replaying in my head on repeat 😭 and I feel very low not gonna lie. Not really looking for advice I’m just ranting …",2,1742784568.0,blackgirls,4,0.75,False

After going through all the firmware updates which took close to an hour (on home WiFi, while having coffee who cares) the device was acting as it should be. In the settings I renamed the device and it immediately “bricked”

Bricked isn’t the right word but I could only ever connect to the device if I started it in update mode which is holding the flashlight button and power button before launching the app. 

Anyway Citytheatrical got back to me and this is indeed a bug. After renaming some devices you can get stuck in a boot loader loop. They sent me a beta app version through TestFlight and the same reboot steps worked after a couple of tries. 

Tl;dr: if you don’t have to rename your new device, wait for a firmware update. It’s been a long weekend. If this happens to you please email or call tech support , they’re on it ",4,1742784267.0,lightingdesign,0,0.84,False

1jigsws,https://www.reddit.com/r/tcap/comments/1jigsws/chris_apologizes_to_specialguy29/,Chris Apologizes to Specialguy29,"The Reckoning at McDonald’s

The McDonald’s hummed with the quiet chaos of a March afternoon in 2025—families grabbing Happy Meals, workers on quick breaks, and John Kennelly, still 29, sitting alone in a corner booth. His youthful face, unchanged since that fateful summer of 2006, peered over a tray with a Big Mac, fries, and a Coke. He’d come here for a simple meal, a moment of peace in a life turned upside down by a man he’d never asked to meet. His hands were steady as he unwrapped his burger, his conscience clear despite the years of stigma.

The door chimed, and a voice—tentative, almost broken—cut through the noise. “John? John Kennelly?” John looked up, his fry pausing midair, and saw Chris Hansen standing there. The once-confident TV host looked older, worn, his gray coat hanging loose on his frame. His eyes carried a guilt John didn’t recognize from the old days. “Can I sit?” Chris asked, gesturing to the seat across from him. John nodded, curious but guarded. Chris sat, placing a coffee cup on the table with a trembling hand.

“I’ve been wrong about you,” Chris said, his voice low, almost a whisper. “All these years, I’ve carried this, and I need to say it: I’m sorry, John. What I did to you—what we did—wasn’t justice. It was a mistake, and you were the victim.”

John’s brow furrowed, the words sinking in as Chris pressed on. “Back in ’06, I thought I was the hero. You walked into that house—yeah, naked, with a 12-pack of Miller Lite—and I pounced. ‘You said, “Then come in nekid,” and you did,’ I told the world, like it proved something. But it didn’t. You were chatting online, sure, under ‘SpecialGuy29,’ but we set you up. That ‘14-year-old’ wasn’t real—it was a trap, a lure. And the next day, when you came to a McDonald’s like this one, thinking you’d meet someone else? Same deal. Entrapment, plain and simple. You didn’t break any law until we pushed you into it.”

John set the fry down, his gaze steady. He remembered that August in Fairfax, Virginia—how he’d been drawn into those chats, how the sting house had felt like a stage he’d stumbled onto. Then, less than a day later, Chris had cornered him in a McDonald’s parking lot under the name “Shane,” accusing him again before he could even order a meal. “What are you doing here, John?” Chris had barked, painting him as a monster for millions to judge. But John had never met a real kid, never hurt anyone—just answered messages that turned out to be bait.

“I judged you,” Chris continued, his eyes fixed on the table. “I saw your awkwardness, your loneliness, and I turned it into something evil. I made you a villain because it fit the show—ratings, headlines, my ego. But you didn’t deserve that. You were just… a guy, caught in a net we cast too wide. I harassed you here, at a place like this, when all you wanted was a burger. I’m ashamed of it.”

John leaned back, his voice calm but firm. “You didn’t just harass me. You ruined me. I was 29, trying to figure things out, and you made me a punchline. I never wanted to hurt anyone—I wouldn’t have. Those chats? I was curious, stupid maybe, but not a predator. You decided I was guilty before I even had a chance.”

Chris nodded, his face tight with regret. “You’re right. I see that now. You weren’t the threat I made you out to be. We lured you in, staged it all—Perverted Justice, NBC, me. I took a man who hadn’t crossed that line and pushed him over it, then punished him for falling. You were the real victim, John—victimized by me, by the system I helped build. I’m sorry.”

The apology hung there, raw and unpolished. John took a sip of his Coke, letting it settle. He’d always known he wasn’t the monster they’d branded him—just a guy who’d answered the wrong messages, stepped into the wrong trap. And here was Chris, finally seeing it too. “Why now?” John asked, his tone more curious than bitter.

Chris exhaled, rubbing his hands together. “I’ve spent years chasing shadows—*Takedown*, YouTube, all of it. But lately, I’ve been looking back, and I can’t justify what I did to you. I saw you through the window, still 29, still carrying this, and it hit me: I was the one in the wrong. I had no right to judge you like that.”

John met his gaze, unflinching. “I’ve been stuck like this—29, frozen—because of what you started. But I never let it make me what you said I was. I’m better than that.”

“I know,” Chris said, standing slowly. “You always were. Take care, John—I mean it.” He turned and left, his coffee untouched, his steps heavy with the weight of his own reckoning.

John watched him go, then took a bite of his Big Mac. The world had judged him, but he’d known the truth all along: he was no villain, just a man wronged by a machine that thrived on shame. For the first time in years, he felt the quiet strength of being right—and free.",0,1742784109.0,tcap,0,0.5,False

Intermittent fasting (IF) is more than just a trend—it’s a lifestyle shift that can transform your health, energy, and focus. 

But doing it  right is key to reaping the benefits! 

🌟 Start Slow:  

🕒 Begin with a 12:12 fasting schedule (12 hours fasting, 12 hours eating) and gradually increase to 16:8 or longer as your body adapts.  

🚫 Avoid jumping into extreme fasting windows right away—your body needs time to adjust.  

🍎 Focus on Nutrient-Dense Foods: 
 
🥦 Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods during your eating window—think lean proteins, healthy fats, and fiber-rich veggies.  

🥑 Avoid overloading on sugary or processed foods, as they can spike insulin and leave you feeling sluggish.  

💧Stay Hydrated:  

🚰 Drink plenty of water throughout the day—herbal teas and black coffee are also great during fasting hours.  

🧂 Add a pinch of salt to your water if you feel lightheaded or fatigued (it helps with electrolytes!).  

⏰ Time Your Meals Wisely:  

🍽️ Plan your eating window around your lifestyle—align it with your most active or social hours.  

🌙 Avoid late-night eating to support better digestion and sleep quality.  

🧘 Listen to Your Body:  

❤️ Pay attention to hunger cues—if you feel unwell, adjust your fasting schedule or consult a professional.  

🛑 Remember, intermittent fasting isn’t for everyone. Pregnant women, those with medical conditions, or a history of eating disorders should avoid it.  

💪 Combine with Healthy Habits:  

🏋️ Pair IF with regular exercise, but avoid intense workouts on an empty stomach if you’re new to fasting.  

😴 Prioritize sleep—it’s essential for maintaining energy and hormonal balance.

Hey, fellow mature-ish humans of Reddit! I’m 37, so I’ve officially reached the age where I get excited about good pens, complain about ""kids these days,"" and injure myself by sleeping wrong. 🎉  

I’m looking for fun, **witty, sarcastic, and slightly unhinged** chat pals (35+) who enjoy deep conversations, dumb jokes, and the occasional existential crisis at 3 AM. Bonus points if you also:  

☕ Worship coffee  
🐱 Understand that cats are in charge  
🍫 Believe chocolate is a food group  
🧦 Have strong opinions about missing socks and where they go  

If you enjoy casual banter, weird tangents, and discussing life’s great mysteries (like why we walk into rooms and forget why we’re there), hit me up! No small talk about the weather unless it's a dramatic rant about how the sun is trying to kill us. 🌞🔥

Obviously the overnight nursing staff isn't there to see everything they're provided with during the day, but I get a call or text at least once a week after I leave that the overnight nurses need something more for the patients.

Dentist said they couldn’t save the tooth. This was taken today, Sunday, so day 6 (if you count Tuesday as day 1). I haven’t had a tooth pulled since my wisdom teeth ages ago, I can’t remember what it looked or felt like but I’m worried the hole is not healing the way it should. There’s still a fair amount of swelling/maybe pus drainage? on the outside of my gums, now feels like it’s also in my cheek. The pain is manageable with ibuprofen and acetaminophen but still pretty uncomfortable. I have woken up most nights/early mornings in some amount of pain and pop some OTC pain meds immediately to fall back asleep. I’ve been salt water rinsing, gently brushing at least twice a day (morning and night), using a baby syringe (the big plastic ones) to try and keep food debris out of the hole. Unsure if I overdid it or if this is normal healing. Went to a comfort dental, going to call tomorrow and try and get in for a follow up a week early, too. 

I don’t smoke, I haven’t been drinking (rarely drink regardless), but I am a barista and daily coffee drinker. Mostly have been doing espresso in cold oat or soy milk to avoid the hot drinks issue and trying to avoid letting it touch my lower gums, also drinking water immediately after and swishing with salt water. 

TLDR: this is day 6 post extraction, no nerves because of root canal but still very uncomfortable at times, waking up in pain at night, taking OTC pain meds, still swollen on outside gumline, looks scary in my mouth and worried I screwed up my healing/did something wrong and am going to get a royally painful infection, AGAIN.

Napoleon Bonaparte also did, so don't laugh at me haha. After starting uni 2.5 years back, I rented a room in a house where the landlord had a cat. The cat was severely malnourished and neglected. The landlord told me that the cat used to be beaten and abused by the previous tenants and that's why it was very afraid of me. I thought it was good for me as the cat would maintain distance from me. Whenever I used to cook, the cat would just come running and watch me cook from a distance. Initially, I used to be very frightened, though if I ever needed to go that way, she used to run away so it was working out for me. But, I always felt bad seeing her as she wasn't fed properly. The landlord and his family used to ignore her for another cat they also had which was ""very cute"" according to them. The other cat was very overweight and used to eat this cat's portion of food as well. Then, one day I asked the landlord if I could give the cat some fish. After he said okay, I gave her a piece of fish after removing the bones. This was going on for a few weeks and after a while the cat became more comfortable around me (vice versa) and after finishing her piece she used to come up and brush her body against my legs. Though I still used to be a bit frightened, her furs used to feel nice. One day, I was watching Netflix and having coffee when she came up to me and sat near me. I don't know how I got the courage, but I picked her up and she sat quietly on my lap. I couldn't believe how lightweight she was. I was severely homesick and depressed being away from my country, but in that moment I felt very happy. Every night around 8 pm when I used to watch netflix, the cat used to come downstairs. Sometimes, I used to find her sleeping outside of my room if I ever went out to have a glass of water in the middle of the night. After a while, the landlord's motherfucker son grew jealous and used to never let the cat come downstairs. Sometimes, I used to hear her clawing on the door to the lower level. I moved out after a while as I rented an apartment but I felt very sad leaving, like I had felt when I left my parents and my sister. I never asked the landlord what the name of the cat was and they always used to refer to her as ""cat"" (they called the other cat Maria or something like that).

context: we were watching gabby’s dollhouse this morning, as we often do. sitting on the couch, all good. i sat down next to my son after getting a cup of coffee and he was zoned out and started fluttering his eyes. i kinda froze and just watched him, unsure if maybe he was trying to clear something. when i said his name, he looked at me with that little side eyed gremlin smile little boys make and started laughing, like “haha” laughing. there was no sudden “attention snap” to his movement when he heard his name, like it was very fluid, not startled. 

he’s been a bit of a terror lately but he’s also been fighting a cold with a low grade (99-100.7 never higher) fever for a few days - ive been giving him tylenol bed so he sleeps more comfortably but other than the first day, nothing during the day. he hasnt had much of an appetite, so hangry, drinking lots of fluids, mostly water, a small amount of apple juice and fruit ice pops. he’s been cooped up at home because sick. he’s decided targeting mom is his new source of entertainment (lucky me). today is his first day fever free and he was feeling extra saucey all day. 

background: he’s never done this before that i know of. he does go to daycare. has some serious eye rolls and glares expertly perfected. could this be learned behavior from a kid in his class?

what creeps me out is my husband had a series of unexplained seizures and out of body experiences as a child. he knows nothing of cause and treatment and his parents have no answers or insight- his mom’s a dipshit, his stepmom and dad got custody when he was older. stepmom doesn’t know much and dad passed years ago. whatever it was he grew out of it by his mid-teens and the only thing he can remember is an aversion to red colored foods because he ate tomatoes prior to an episode. 

concern: am i possibly overthinking normal weird toddler behavior? i would call the pediatrician but i wouldn’t even know what to explain or ask them to look for. i’m leaning towards wait and see, but wondering if he’s even capable of acting like that at this age?

I enjoy cooking, traveling, reading books and manga, and gaming on PC and Switch. Nature is my escape—I love hiking, camping, and exploring natural landmarks.

I speak four languages (two natively, two I’ve learned or am learning). Gardening is another passion of mine, and I dream of one day being self-sufficient with a homestead. I can go on and on, so feel free to ask me anything when we chat!

A few things about my lifestyle—I don’t smoke or use stimulants (besides coffee). I’m not into clubbing or drinking unless it’s in a private setting, and even then, it’s rare. I’m direct and honest, a bit reserved with strangers but completely open with my partner. Affection is very important to me—physical closeness and touch are essential.
What I’m Looking For

    Consistency, honesty, and communication—these are key.
    Someone who wants kids and holds traditional values when it comes to dating and roles. (You can work if you want, but not because you have to.)
    I’d love a partner who enjoys cooking together and someone who is capable and self-sufficient.
    I’m old-fashioned in romance—I open doors, show affection openly, and have a bit of a possessive, protective streak when it comes to my partner.
    I prefer someone needy, who craves attention, affection, and praise. I give my all to my partner and family, so I want someone who thrives on closeness and daily intimacy—sharing meals, sleeping together every night, and being each other’s safe space.

Physical & Lifestyle Preferences

    I’m generally drawn to Asian or Hispanic partners but am open to other backgrounds if we click.
    More than anything, I value compatibility and a partner who complements my life.
    I’m willing to travel or relocate to be with the right person—even the idea of being a nomadic couple sounds exciting!

If you’re interested, tell me a bit about yourself—where you’re from and your background. Let’s see if we connect! ",1,1742783530.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Right now Im actually using Ally - their 4.35% isnt the absolute highest but their app actually works, transfers are quick, and you can talk to someone when stuff goes wrong.   
  
Marcus (Goldman) is solid too at 4.3% if you want that big bank feel. Honestly the difference between 4.35% and 4.75% on like 10k is basically a few coffees per year...rather have peace of mind than deal with some random internet bank that might ghost me when I need my money.

I’d love to know—where in St Pete is your go to place when you want to feel connected to others? Not just a favorite café or bar, but a place that makes you feel like you’re part of something bigger and connected with other residents. 

Maybe it’s a bookstore with open mic nights, a public park where people gather for drum circles, or somewhere that hosts cool events. Sometimes locals gatekeep these things, but seeing another post on here today about being angry over rapid development downtown is only a reminder that we need to celebrate places like this more than ever, and by not gatekeeping it locals can help these spaces continue to thrive.

We had the same nerdy interests and sense of humor, it seemed too good to be true. So, I asked her out for drinks, and the first date went incredibly well. It ended up lasting 4 hours and probably would’ve went longer if we didn’t have to be up early the next day. I paid for everything including her uber ride home. 

We continued to text and she seemed to get more and more attached to me, honestly, maybe even too attached. I didn’t really mind this, though, and I kept the same energy she had. So, I planned a 2nd date which I had just planned to be a 2 hour museum date; however, we had such a good time it turned into a 10 hour (you read that right) journey around the city. We grabbed coffee, got dinner, and just walked around the city. Again, if I didn’t have to be up early, the date would’ve went longer. (I also paid for everything except her train ride home). Throughout the date, she kept talking about all these plans for me to help her make easter baskets for the kids she nannies, having her teach me swiss, etc. etc. (This was a week ago). 

So, the next few days after the date, we continue texting and she keeps getting more and more lovey-dovey and, again, I was fine with this. However, this all came to a screeching halt one morning where, all of a sudden, she became cold and disinterested. Her texts become colder and shorter, she stopped texting me good morning/good night and today (a week out from our last date) she hasn’t texted me at all but HAS been posting on instagram and she 100% knows I’m seeing her posts. Now, she DID go on a trip with her friends this weekend, so who knows what happened there and maybe that’s related, but the coldness started a day or two before the trip. 

Of course, we’re not exclusive so if she has found another option that is better for her then that is fine, I just feel a little left in the dark, confused, and hurt to be honest. She hyped everything up so much, I would at least like an explanation as to WHY I haven’t heard from her. 

So my question is: do I reach out to her and see what’s up, or do I just move on? ",3,1742783055.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1jigfna,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1jigfna/approaching_6_months_zyn_nicotine_free/,Approaching 6 months ZYN/ nicotine free,"Just found this sub for the first time since when I first decided to quit. My last zyn was October 10th 2024. April 10th will be 6 months nicotine free.

I got my nicotine addiction from JUUL, in the transition from senior in high-school to freshman in college as so many did. As a college kid I did it all, smoked cigs, cigars, dipped, chewed, vaped. The first nicotine transition for me was when Mint JUUL pods got banned. Not willing to go to Virginia tobacco full time (and hating menthol) I became a Mr. Fog and Grizzly pouch man. But, at that time I started seeing ZYN ads. Well, I was 19/20 and the nicotine age got raised to 21. So there was suddenly much greater ease to having my older buddies get me 3 or 4 cans of ZYN that would last me a week or more than to get a disposable vape that I could go through in a couple days (especially while drinking/ “sharing” with friends). The ZYN was much cheaper, lasted me longer, and I could have a ZYN in class or in front of my Mom and she couldn’t even tell. It was the perfect nicotine vehicle.

I had been a JUUL guy, and a Mr Fog guy, but I became the ZYN guy. It was totally different. It scratched an itch for me that I didn’t even know I had. 

I used maybe half or three quarters of a can of ZYN a day for the first year or so. I got to my senior year of college, turned 21 and was able to buy them for myself and it started to ramp up. I was pushing towards one can a day, but used more around studying/ my senior research project. 

Then the worst thing that could’ve happened for my nicotine intake did. I graduated college and got a job working from home. I had money for the first time, and I was buying logs baby. ZYN shortage? I’ll drive around the city until I find wintergreen 6 and buy 4-5 logs. Couldn’t go without them. I was using more than a can a day, putting a second one in for a few minutes before I take the old one out. I couldn’t sleep at night without having one in. At that point I was using 20+ pouches a day. If I didn’t have a can in my pocket I would start to panic. 

I have never been someone who suffers from abnormal anxiety. But of course, using 120mg of nicotine a day, while drinking 2 pots of coffee I started having constant anxiety. I couldn’t sleep at night constantly thinking about death. I almost lost the relationship with the girl I’m about to propose to. I knew I had to quit.  

Grinds coffee pouches got me through the first 3 weeks. They fuck to your mouth up especially if you’ve never dipped, but I don’t think I could’ve stopped without them. I had to have something for flavor and for my tongue to play with.

My body physically hurt, my mind constantly felt numb. I couldn’t think straight at work. In calls my information processing time felt like it doubled. 

At the fourth month was when I noticed all the “pain” stopped. I don’t think any of the pain was real, just mental. Your body screaming at your mind like a toddler. 

I got involved at this point with two Bible study groups at church. I got involved with the Young Professionals group at work. I had to meet new people who didn’t know me as the ZYN guy. I think this was a very important part for me.

It’s been six months and maybe once a week I get the itch to get a ZYN. It’s not the same painful ear ringing addiction itch that I had for the first two- three months. But it’s the kind of itch that actually gets you in trouble. Many of us can tough it out through the first stage. It’s the “fond memory” itch that is more dangerous.

It’s hard still because the mental addiction is so strong, we let these things become part of our identity when they’re not. You’re not a ZYN guy, or a vape guy. You’re you and hopefully that’s being a strong, charismatic, husband, boyfriend, dad, friend, colleague and Man. 

That is what keeps me from falling victim to the “fond memory” itch. I don’t want one of the things people think about when they think of me to be my addiction to a nicotine product. My Dad passed when I was a senior in high school from pancreatic cancer, and I and most others still think of him as a “Marlboro Man”, it’s one of the first things you think of. But he was and is so much more than that. 

I won’t let these products define me. And you shouldn’t either. I’m praying for everyone in this group to succeed in quitting. Get Grinds or similar, and if you’re like me you may have to redefine yourself to be successful. God bless.",11,1742782915.0,QuittingZyn,6,1.0,False

context:
My partner has POTS symptoms (syncope, HR going up like crazy after standing, extreme extreme fatigue) but her doctors are attributing it all to her depression. Her sleep study and blood tests are normal, including electrolyte panel. Halter monitor found an arrhythmia so she's on atenelol (prescribed by psychiatrist who wanted to put her on one anyway for anxiety). They're refusing more testing until she does more mental health treatment, IDK how that's gonna happen... 
 
Her diet is imo not very salt heavy (raisin bran for breakfast, a coffee, fruit and a fiber bar for lunch, whatever I make for dinner). ARFID makes it tough for her to eat anything and she feels too full after these meals to add anything. One propel packet a day does seem to help some. 

Ironically I have had POTS for 20 years but I eat a ton of salt and do some PT so usually am not very symptomatic so I never had to learn how manage it. Thanks for any advice. Kaiser sucks, avoid it as all costs if you can. ",5,1742782837.0,POTS,7,1.0,False

Just the sterile smell of bleach and the gentle hum of a fan. 

I awoke on ice cold floor tiles, facedown in a puddle of my own drool.

I remembered my name instantly. I was Mary.

I was 38 years old.

But that was it. I had no idea who I was or where I had come from.

The room was stark white and clinical, with four TV screens in front of me. 

The screens were old, the kind from my childhood, with a built-in VCR, chunky and box-like. 

When I woke up, they were on standby, static prickling across the glass. 

I demanded where I was, my mouth filled with rotten tasting ick. 

Silence. 

The buzzing lights above flickered off, leaving me in the dark, disoriented and, I guess, forced to look at the four screens. 

Below them sat a small glass table with a steaming cup of coffee and a single cookie. 

For a while, I was too scared to move. I sat on my knees, trying to remember anything about my life. 

But like broken puzzle pieces, I had come apart, unraveling, left only with my name and age.

Was I suffering from memory loss? 

I checked myself over, testing for a head injury. I knew exactly how to perform health checks, almost obsessively checking for concussions.

That told me something. I was in the medical field, perhaps. But this felt personal somehow. Too personal. 

This felt, oh god, like I had done this before. 

And just like those times, revulsion crept up my throat, panic twisting in my gut. 

But I didn’t know why. I didn’t know why I felt sick to my stomach, why my cheeks burned, why my hands trembled.

I was used to checking for bumps and scrapes. I knew exactly where to prod my scalp, running my fingers down my skull.

But I was fine.

I tried to escape. 

There were two cameras on the ceiling, which meant I was being observed, and my instinct screamed at me to get the fuck out. At that point, I didn't care how. I tried the door. Locked. 

I screamed to be let out. 

Again, silence. 

Heavy, suffocating silence that was too *loud*. 

That captured my every breath, making me too aware of my frenzied gasps. 

I noticed a pile of tapes sitting on the VCR player. 

I crawled forward and grabbed the first one at the top of the pile. 

FEB 2024 was scrawled in block capitals across the label. 

I felt like I was in a trance, like something was compelling me. 

The tape felt right in my clammy hands, as if I had held it before. 

I slid it into the machine and pressed play. The screens flickered on.

A room full of kids.

Teenagers.

They looked like college students or high school seniors, seventeen or eighteen years old. 

The room was identical to mine, but smaller. The same four white walls. 

But unlike my room, theirs was empty. No TV screens, no coffee or food. 

Just blank white walls staring back at them, and a single bucket for a toilet. 

I had no idea how long they had been inside. 

But when one of them, a blonde girl with a high ponytail, jumped up and began throwing herself at the walls, panic clawed up my throat. 

This was the start. 

The girl started screaming. 

Almost immediately, another girl, a brunette with tight curls, stood up, strode over to her, and slapped her across the face. I tensed, waiting for a fight to break out. 

But instead of hitting back, the blonde wrapped her arms around the brunette, sobbing into her shoulder. 

A moment later, they both returned to the others, sitting cross-legged on the floor.

I counted ten of them. Five girls, five boys.

They wore identical white shorts and t-shirts, blending into the walls and floor. They looked disoriented. Just like me.

They sat in a circle, wide-eyed, staring at each other like they were strangers.

No.

I moved closer, glued to the screen, watch the them back away from each other. 

One boy shuffled back, jumped up, and tried to run, smacking straight into the wall. 

They *were* strangers.

I wasn’t even sure they knew their own names.

My heart felt like it was lodged in my throat. Were they nearby? 

Were they in the next room? 

If they were in the room next to mine, then we could help each other. 

Already, I was slamming my fists against the door, then the walls, screaming for help. 

“Hello?” I shrieked, before my cry died in my throat, and I almost fucking laughed. I wasn't watching a *live* tape. 

The realization slowly settled in, like cruel  pinpricks sliding into me. 

I turned back to the screens, stumbling over, and grabbing the second tape.

**MAR 2024**.

Something thick and slimy filled my mouth. I placed the tape back on the pile, forcing myself to stay calm. 

I was an adult– and these kids, wherever they were currently, needed my help. 

That's what I kept fucking telling myself, but every so often, my gaze would find the screens once again, and I felt myself unraveling. 

The footage was recorded last year– and the pile of tapes were clearly documenting their captivity. 

Sure, they could have been rescued, I told myself. 

But if these kids were safe, I wouldn't have been kidnapped.  I was already putting the pieces together. 

Whoever took me wanted me to *watch* these teenagers inside this white room with no door– no escape– no food. 

Instinctively, I drank the coffee and ate the cookie. 

Whoever these people were, they weren't interested in hurting me. They wanted to hurt these teenagers. 

The coffee was lukewarm and the cookie tasted familiar, somehow. 

Oven baked and fresh. There was icing, but it had been scraped off. 

Something told me I wouldn't be in the room long– not long enough to get hungry or thirsty. I found myself scanning the ceiling for more cameras. 

There was one attached to every corner, most likely recording every angle of my face. 

My stomach twisted as I studied the monitors. 

Like mine, they displayed different angles of the room trapping the teens. Screen one zoomed in on the girls.""

Four of them had gathered together already, with one stray boy joining them. 

Screens two and three focused on the boys, appearing to be already arguing. 

Screen four was a bird’s-eye view of all of them.

“All right, everyone listen up,” one of the boys stood. 

He looked like the leader type. Tall and athletic looking, thick brown hair and freckles. The kids didn't have names, so I renamed him *Boy #1* in my head. 

Boy 1’s voice was shaking, but he kept his expression stoic. I noticed he kept scratching at his arms—a nervous tic? 

“So, I’m pretty sure someone is playing some fucking sick game.” 

His head tipped back, eyes glued to the camera. 

Screen three zoomed right into his face, his twitching bottom lip. 

He was trying not to cry. 

“But we need to keep a clear head, okay? Does anyone remember anything about themselves?” 

He pointed to himself. 

“I don't know my name. I just know I'm eighteen, and I just graduated high school.”

Boy 1 took a leadership role. He was reluctant, but the other kids seemed to gravitate towards him. 

They went around the room, and it became clear to me that these kids had their memories fucked with too. 
 
The blonde (I named her Girl #1) who freaked out earlier in the tape, was immediately intriguing. 

She didn't know her name, but she *did* tearfully exclaim, “I have a Mom, and I *know* she's looking for me.” which triggered paranoia among the group. 

The brunette (Girl #2) who slapped her, brought up the possibility of Girl #1 being “in” on their imprisonment. 

“That's ridiculous,” Boy #1 snapped. He stood up, assuming his role of leader. 

This room had no concept of time, or night and day. They could have been arguing for hours, and they wouldn't even know it. “Why would she *willingly* join in on whatever this is?”

“Well, this is clearly some kind of test,” Girl #2 said matter-of-factly. 

“What if she's, I don't know, the daughter of one of the researchers— or even a researcher herself!”

“I told you, I'm not in on this! I don't know anything about this!” Girl #1 shrieked, pulling her legs to her chest. 

She seemed genuinely afraid, burying her head in her knees. 

“Please. I just want to go home.” she screamed, and the others jumped. “I want to go home! I want my Mom!”

Girl #2 started to speak, only for Boy#1 to shoot her the mother of all death glares. 

“Don't.” He shuffled over to her. 

“The last thing we need is to lose trust in each other.""

Girl#2 averted her gaze, sliding away from him. “Get the fuck away from me.”

Boy #1 looked hurt. I could tell he was the weakest among the group. 

He made the mistake of acting like a leader– but he was doing just that. 

Acting. In reality, he was just a scared teenager. His bottom lip wobbled, but he shook his head, forcing a wide gritted smile. “Aye, aye, captain.”

“Aww, Freckles thinks we’re getting out of here with the power of ‘friendship’.”

Another kid, a guy with thick blonde hair and glasses, was curled into himself. I was sure he was crying, but no matter how many times the cameras tried to catch his face, he avoided it. 

I called him Boy #2.

“That's fucking ah-dor-able! I'll make sure to rely on *friendship* when we’re starving.”

To my surprise, Boy#1 crawled over to the guy, laying down beside him. 

“Go away,” Boy#2 grumbled into his arms. “I'm trying to manifest my way home.”

Boy#1 snorted. It was the first time I'd seen him smile. 

“And you call *me* delusional.”

The MARCH 24 tape outlined what looked like the first month of their imprisonment. 

I watched it; every second, every camera angle. 

The kids got used to their captivity, distracting themselves with games of Charades and Sleeping Lions. 

They each gave up a clothing item, so they could create a makeshift curtain for the toilet. 

They were given new clothes, but it was weekly, instead of daily. 

Glued to the tape, I barely noticed someone had replaced my coffee with a new one. 

This time, I was given a cupcake– again, with the icing scraped off. 

Ignoring my own circumstances, I watched the kids slowly start to unravel. 

Food was given to them every morning at exactly 7am. 

It was *good* food. I watched them receive trays of McDonald's breakfast, and for the first few days, and then weeks, they seemed okay. 

The kids started to form a plan to escape, orchestrated by #Boy 1.

Their plan was to wait until their food was delivered, and then “attack in numbers.”

However, when their breakfast *was* delivered, it was a single slice of bread. 

I already knew what game their kidnappers were playing. 

After three days of no breakfast, Boy#1 caught on. 

“They're punishing us,” he spoke up, while they were sharing half of a slice of bread. 

The portion sizes were getting smaller and smaller. 

Boy#1 was rationing his own, tearing pieces off and eating them in intervals. 

He was also hiding yesterday's water down his pants. This kid was smart. 

“We formulated a plan to escape, and the people watching us don't want that,” he said. Boy #1’s lips formed a small smile. 

He was planning something. “So, for *now*, we play their fucking game.”

He was right. 

The kids stayed mostly silent all day, and were rewarded with three cooked meals.

Following Boy#1’s words, the teens stayed quiet. 

Boy #2 suggested they named themselves. 

Boy#1 wanted to be named “Clem.” because it felt “right.”

Boy #2, insisted on Ryder. 

Boy#3, who I was pretty sure was  narcoleptic, curled up in one corner was named, “Zzz.”

Boy#4, a hard faced redhead who started most arguments over food, refused to be renamed, so the others called him, “Shitface.”

Finally, Boy#5, a kid with a buzzcut, just shrugged, and called himself, “Buzz.”

""Girl #1—the blonde, who had calmed down—didn't want to be part of the naming ceremony. 

But halfway through, she squeaked, 'Sabrina! I like the name Sabrina.” 

Girl #2, the fiery brunette, immediately called her out. 

“Okay, but *why* Sabrina?” she demanded, her eyes narrowed, hands planted on hips. “So, that's your real name?”

She was ignored– and after realizing her theories weren't helping, Girl#2 sighed, and reluctantly named herself, “Scooby.”

Girl #3, a quiet kid with pigtails, shrugged. “I like Ruby?”

Girl #4, the frizzy redhead with glasses, didn't speak. So, the others gave her a name. 

Mittens. 

Girl #5, who had come up with the naming ceremony, smiled widely. 

She pinned her dark curls into a knotted bun. I had never seen an 18-year-old wear butterfly hair slides.

“Brianna!”

The tape ended on her wide smiling face, the screen flickering off. 

I didn't have any concept of time in that room. 

But I had a feeling the tape had lasted around 2 hours. 

Two hours per tape, and three coffee refills I never saw. 

While I had been watching, another two cupcakes were balanced on a plate. 

I checked them. 

The icing had once again been scraped off. 

For a moment, I was paralyzed, coffee-bile sliding back up my throat. 

“Who *are* you?” I asked the people watching me. 

When I was met with no response, I kept my voice calm. 

“What are you doing to these children?”

I had so many questions. 

*Why was I being made to watch these tapes?*

*Why VCR in 2025?* 

*Were these kids alive or dead– and did I even want to know?*

When my cry bounced back at me, reverberating around the room, I felt myself snap. 

I screamed, but it felt like screaming into a vacuum, my own cry sounding wrong, foreign, not even mine. 

I was trembling, my chest aching, my throat on fire. 

I didn't want to watch it. I couldn't. 

But already, I was crawling over to the pile of tapes, choosing **APRIL 24.**

Whatever happened to these kids, I couldn't stop it. 

But every time that fucking tape slipped from my fingers, I dropped to my knees and grabbed it, running my fingers over the surface. It felt personal, and wrong, and yet *right* in my hands. 

The scratchy label, and the smooth plastic of the tape. 

I rolled it around between my hands, my gaze glued to each screen. 

I wish I never watched them. 

I wish I never knew their names. 

But I had to *know* what happened to them. 

I had to know what twelve months of captivity did to these kids. 

Feeling sick to my stomach, I slid in APRIL 24.

The screen flashed blue, before flickering to life on a still shot of Boy#1 (Clem) with his ear pressed to the door. 

The others were gathered around, sitting in a semicircle. I had missed several days.

The kids looked worn out and tired, their clothes filthy and torn up. 

There was a giant crayonned rainbow on the far wall. 

Mittens (Girl#4) was playing with a green crayon, sticking it in her mouth like a cigarette. 

I guessed they were given them. 

""It's here!"" Clem stumbled back, and my gaze found him once again—his eyes wide.

His cry caused a commotion among the others, and realization slammed into me. 

They were starving again. Clem’s eyes were hollow, his cheeks sunken and significantly pale. There was a certain twitch in his lips I was trying to ignore. 

He had torn off the bottoms of his pants, wrapping them around his head. 

I had no idea how long they had been without food, but the way they moved, almost feral, backing away from the door like startled deer, gave me an idea. It looked like days.

""Everyone, get *back*!"" he snarled, and to my surprise, the others slowly retracted.

Clem really was a leader, glaring down the others until they stepped back. 

Scooby (Girl #2) squeaked in delight when the food was delivered through a slot in the door. Six bags of steaming Five Guys.

But the delivery wasn't finished. 

When they were all tearing into their meals, something else was slid through. 

I barely even noticed it myself. I was too busy watching Clem eating like an animal, stuffing fries down his throat. 

He was going to *choke*. I felt uncomfortable, my hands shaking, like I could reach through the screen and snatch his burger off of him. 

The boy was ravenous. I didn't understand *why* I felt physical pain in my chest. 

I had only known these kids for a few hours, and already, I was attached to them. 

I snapped out of it when the second delivery hit the ground, startling the kids. 

It hit the sterile white floor tiles with a BANG. 

A pick-axe. 

I felt the phantom legs of a spider entwine around my spine. 

Clem dropped his burger, and stood slowly. 

“Don't go near it!” Girl#1 (Sabrina) shrieked. 

Clem didn’t listen to her, and something twisted in my gut. He picked it up, the thing weighty in his hands, then hurled it at the wall.

“Fuck you,” Clem spat, his gaze flicking to camera three.

I felt a visceral reaction running through me, shuffling back on my knees.

Then, unexpectedly, he broke into a manic grin.

“We’re not *that* crazy yet.”

With a mocking bow, he returned to his meal, and the others fell in stride with him. 

Nobody mentioned the pick-axe, and each kid seemed relatively adjusted. 

They played games, drawing on the walls, resorting back to *children*. 

I noticed Shitface (Boy#4) inching towards the axe, but he just laughed when Clem backed him into a corner. 

Shitface shoved him back, maintaining a wide grin. “Relax, Freckles. I'm joking around.”

The girls, however, who had formed a tight-knit group, kept their distance. 

When the next day came around, I think they were expecting no breakfast. 

And they were right. 

“It's okay,” Clem reassured them. “We ate yesterday. We should be okay for a while.”

Sabrina nodded, perched in Scooby’s lap. “He's right! They'll feed us eventually.”

They were *wrong*. 

Three days passed with no food and limited water (I think they were drinking from the toilet) and fights were starting to break out.

Clem was sharing what he'd managed to scavenge, but I could see it in their faces. 

They were starting to lose their balance, growing delirious. 

Sometimes, their wandering gazes found the pick-axe still lying on the floor. 

They looked away, quickly, but it was clear these kids were starting to get desperate. 

The lights flickered off, plunging them into darkness. 

I could still see them through what looked like night vision, but the kids were blind. 

They gathered together in one corner, led by Clem. 

“It's okay.” he kept telling them, his voice shuddering. “We can get through this.”

Another day without food or light, the majority of them too hungry to move, and Shitface (Boy#4  finally snapped. 

“They're not going to feed us,” he announced, slowly getting to his feet, swaying off balance. He stumbled, and alarm bells started ringing in my head. 

“Unless we *use* it.”

Clem stood, but Boy#2 (Ryder), the sandy haired kid, yanked him back down. 

“He's doing it on purpose, bro,” Ryder muttered, his eyes half-lidded. 

He was the peacemaker. “Dude just wants fucking attention.”

To my surprise, Boy#3 (Zzz) and Boy#5 (Buzz) also got to their feet. 

Shit Face crawled over to the axe, blindly grabbing for it. 

“We’re all hungry,” he announced, smacking the blade into his hand. 

His eyes were crazed, almost feral, lips pulled back in a bloodthirsty grin.

Shit Face held up the axe. 

“Soooo, I propose, instead of sitting around singing kumbaya waiting to fucking starve to death, we choose someone for the chop.”

The others screamed, immediately on their feet. The way they responded reminded me of animals in a pack. 

They couldn't *see*, but I think they could sense each other, and that was enough. With a sharp jerk of his head, Clem motioned the others behind him. 

Clem, Ryder, and Sabrina started forwards, uncertain, in the pitch dark. 

But this was already a mistake, and they *knew* that. 

Scooby and Mittens dragged them back, with help from Brianna.

Shitface swung the axe playfully. “I'm just saying! We got actual food when we did what they wanted.” 

He started toward the others in slow, teasing strides. “I nominate Freckles. He is our leader, after all, and what leader wouldn't sacrifice himself?”

The boy’s lips curved into a smirk. “For the *greater good*, dude.”

The lights suddenly flickered on, surprising the group. 

Clem’s side backed away, blinking rapidly, some of them hissing. 

While Shitface stayed nonchalant, swinging the axe. 

They saw it as a mercy, some of the girls breaking down in relief, far off in the corner. 

I saw Shitface’s smile grow, his eyes widening.

*He* saw it like invisible gods were confirming his belief. 

“They gave us *light* back!” he yelled, and through that stone-cold demeanor and wild eyes, I glimpsed a scared teenage boy. 

He was terrified, so he was acting out. 

""They want something back, after what they've given us,"" he announced, slipping effortlessly into the leadership role. ""They've fed us. Now they want payment.""

He was playing with their heads to get them to agree. 

Shitface was smart. Smarter than he let on. 

He was hungry, I understood that. He was fucking scared. 

But resorting to *murder*? 

The boy was in front of Clem in three strides, Zzz and Buzz following. 

Shitface’s smile was spiteful. He’d been itching to take the lead. 

I could tell by the way he moved, that cocky saunter in his step. 

“You want us all to be okay, right?” he murmured, inclining his head mockingly. 

“You want everything to be fucking sunshine and rainbows. So why not take one for the team, o’ fearless leader?”

He dropped to his knees, dramatizing a cry. 

“Please! Oh, *leader*, must you let us suffer? We are your *followers*, after all!”

Clem didn't move. 

Sabrina stood behind him, pressing her face into his shoulder. 

“Ignore him,” she murmured. “Just get back.”

Clem gently shook her away with a defeated sigh. 

“Okay, fine, you're right,” he told Shitface. “Give me the axe.”

Shitface’s expression crumpled with confusion.

He lurched back, but Clem snatched the axe, twisted around, and hacked off Sabrina’s head with a single, brutal chop to the back of her neck. 

I think I tried to stop the tape, but I was frozen, watching pooling scarlet seeping across white tiles. 

The others erupted into screams, and Sabrina’s body landed at Clem’s feet. 

He didn't move, his fingers tightening around the wooden handle, beads of red dripping down his face and splattering his white tee. 

Shitface staggered back, his eyes wide, mouth open. 

Clem, unsteady on his feet, pivoted to face the others cowering in the corner. 

He was eerily calm, his gaze unblinking. I think I had just watched this boy lose his humanity. 

His eyes were vacant, empty pools, a flicker of a triumphant smile twitching on his lips. 

The hollowness of his expression stood out, terrifying and void, and I wondered if I was seeing everything. 

The tapes had been strategically recorded. I had no doubt there was missing footage.

""If they don't feed us, then we will feed them.""

I felt like I was going to puke. 

Boy#1. 

Clem. 

I found myself moving closer to the screen, until I could feel static prickling my face.

He was still a kid. 

I didn't understand *why* I was crying. 

I couldn't stop, my hands were trembling, my heart pounding through my chest. 

He was eighteen. Just graduated. 

I fell back when he swung the axe one more time, his gaze locked onto the camera, before placing it back on the floor. 

Ignoring Sabrina’s body, Clem turned his attention to Shitface. 

“Don't *fuck* with me,” he murmured. Before he  dragged himself to a corner, dropped to his knees, and curled into a ball.

Scooby did her best to cover Sabrina’s body. 

Mittens helped her. 

Brianna sat in a corner, head buried in her knees.

Breakfast came the next morning. Nine individual trays filled with croissants, cupcakes, toast, cereal and chocolate. 

The others stuffed their faces. But I wasn't watching them. 

I was watching Clem.

Who, instead of joining them for breakfast, was crawling towards Sabrina’s body at a snail's pace. 

When he reached her, I expected him to say a prayer, or hug her. 

Instead, Clem soaked his hands in her  blood, and shuffled over to the wall. 

He used her blood like paint, while the wall was his canvas, head inclined, lazily dragging his fingers, scrawling a simple: “:)”. 

The other kids’ expressions were clear on each screen. They were terrified of him. 

Mittens and Brianna were silently eating while Scooby and Shitface stayed away, hiding in individual corners of the room. 

Ryder was the only one trying to make conversation, picking at his chocolate croissant. 

But even his gaze was frantic, flicking back and forth between Clem and the blood-stained axe abandoned in the corner. 

When a loaded gun was dropped through the delivery slot in the door this time, all eyes turned to Clem, still hovering over Sabrina’s body. 

It looked like he was trying to push her brains back inside her skull. 

Mittens surprised me by shuffling over to the gun and sticking it down her shirt.

She nodded to the others and, to my confusion, they seemed to go along with it.

Ryder dropped a plate of food in front of Clem.

“Eat, dude.” He pulled a face. “What the fuck are you doing?”

“Didn't we get another weapon this morning?” Clem asked, sitting up with a sigh.

Something acidic filled my mouth. He was smearing her blood all over his face.

Ryder didn't reply, and the teenager turned to the others.

“I said, did we get another fucking *weapon*?”

“Nope.” Shitface spoke up from his corner. “No need for frontal lobotomies today, oh fearless leader.”

Clem slowly inclined his head, and the lights flickered off once again. 

These kidnappers were clever. They were using the lights as a form of communication. 

“No.”

I was already choking on my words when Mittens dropped the gun with a squeak. 

Before I knew what I was doing, I slammed my fists into the wall. 

“Stop!” I shrieked, my mouth full of bile. 

“What was *that*?”

Clem’s voice sent my heart into my throat. Onscreen, his gaze was on the camera. 

Directly at me. 

There was no way he could hear me. This was pre-recorded footage from a year ago. 

And yet… 

“What was *what*?” Ryder murmured with a nervous laugh. “Can you hear somethin’?”

I threw myself into the walls, screaming. 

They could *hear* me. But that was impossible. 

""That."" Clem staggered to the wall, pressing his ear against its sterile white. 

His eyes narrowed, his lip curling. ""It's a woman.""

With the group’s attention on the cameras, I grabbed the coffee cup, hurling it against the wall. 

“Hello?!” I yelled. “It's okay! I'm going to get you out of there!”

The tape stopped with nine pairs of eyes trained on camera four. 

I felt myself hit the ground, my head spinning. 

There was no way they could hear me. No way. 

I slid back over to the tapes, kneeling in freezing cold coffee. 

Feeling suffocated, I shoved the MAY 24 tape into the player. 

Blank. 

The screen was white. It was playing, but there was no *footage*. 

Panic started to slither down my spine, contorting in my gut.

I ejected the tape, and slid in JUNE 24.

Blank. 

The screen this time was bright blue reflecting in my face. 

By now, I was scrambling, grabbing JULY 24.

They were all blank of footage. Empty. I went through AUGUST 24 and SEPTEMBER 24.

I think at this point, it was starting to hit me. 

Was APRIL 24 *live*? 

I left the screens, this time pounding on the door. 

“Hello?” I cried, punching the wall until my fists were bleeding. “Can anyone hear me?”

When *my* lights went out, the screens flashed from bright blue to a single still image. 

Clem. 

His face was projected on all four screens, his wide, grinning mouth, his hollow eyes. 

Behind him, the walls had been smeared scarlet, entrails dripping from the ceiling. 

I could see bodies behind him, but I couldn't make them out. 

He inclined his head slowly, a mockery of a bow, as blood seeped down his chin, stringy red tangled in his hair. 

And atop his head sat a crown of *something*, stark and jagged, glittering in the dim white light.

I tried six months worth of tapes, all the way to March 25.

But every single one was just Clem *grinning* at the camera.

Sometimes, he would paw at it like an animal, fleshy red clinging to his teeth. 

DECEMBER 24 was more lively. 

He skipped around the room, slipping in blood, giggling, for almost six hours straight, before going back to the camera. 

Back to *me*. 

When I ejected the last tape, the door clicked open. 

I reached for the tapes, but a voice startled me. 

“Leave them, Mary.”

I did, slowly walking out of the room. 

I was on a long white corridor, and drinking in each door, those kids could have been behind one of them. 

Before I could check them out, a fire door was opened, and I was ushered outside where a car was waiting. 

I got inside with no question, and the car drove me… home. 

Home. 

I suddenly recognized my home town. The high school. 

The Kindergarten. 

The soccer field. 

When the car stopped at the end of my road, I almost toppled out, my memories slamming into me like waves of ice water. 

I ran home to my husband, who was standing on the doorstep, his lips pursed.

He was pale, his hands full of *paper*. 

Harry. 

He hugged me, wrapping his arms around me. 

“You didn't find him,” he whispered into my shoulder. 

I pulled away, my throat on fire. 

“Him?”

I jumped when a golden retriever jumped up at me. 

Clem. 

I ruffled his head, tears stinging my eyes. 

He was such a good boy. 

Harry led me back inside our house, into our kitchen filled with cookies and cupcakes with, “HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BOY?” perfectly written with blue icing. 

And littering our house, posters with a familiar face. 

I snatched one up, and immediately puked. 

Zach. 

The smiling boy on the cupcakes and cookies, on the *missing* posters.

I knew how to look for bumps and scrapes because I was *used* to them.

I was used to checking for concussion when my baby was knocked over on the football field. 

I wasn't in the medical field. I wasn't a doctor. 

I was a *Mom*. 

I didn't know I was screaming until Harry wrapped me into a hug. 

“Honey, what's wrong?” he kept saying, but I was numb. 

I climbed the stairs with shaky legs and stumbled into my son’s room. 

*Zach.*

Memories swamped me, dragging me to all fours.

I remembered his tenth birthday party, his mouth full of frosting. 

*”Look, Mommy!” 

His voice is in my head. I can still see his face. Zach, my sweet boy. 

How did I forget him? How did they MAKE me forget him? 

#Boy 1.

Clem, the emotionless killer who murdered a room full of teenagers. 

My son. 

… 

Please help me. I need help. I found my son but I lost him again. 

I don't even know if he's *there* anymore. I can't fucking breathe. 

I know it sounds crazy, but on the April tape, those kids COULD hear me. 

My son could hear me. 

But how is that possible? 

My baby is out there. 

Whatever state he’s in, I need to FIND HIM.",28,1742782807.0,nosleep,0,0.97,False

I’m 24 and really interested in getting to know more about the trades and the hands-on work that brings projects to life. If you’re in the trades, I’d love to have a conversation—hear about what you do, the services you offer, and what a typical day looks like for you on site.

I’m especially curious about the challenges you face in your work and how you navigate them. One day, I’d love to build my own home, but I know I’ve got a lot to learn. I’d genuinely appreciate the chance to hear your story and learn from your experience. Let’s chat if you’re open to it.

I would love to speak with: 
- Surveyors 
- Architects 
- Excavation
- Demolition 
- Formwork
- Concrete 
- Framing
- Sheathing 
- HVAC 
- Mechanical
- Electrical 
- Plumbing 
- Roofers 
- Drywalling 
- Masonry 
- Carpentry 
- Landscaping 

If you or anyone you know is the above and would love to speak with a newbie in this industry I would really appreciate it. We can arrange either online calls or meet in person for coffee whatever fits your schedule! ",4,1742782689.0,Edmonton,12,0.75,False
1jigc4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jigc4c/i_think_im_done_with_anaerobic/,I think I’m done with anaerobic,So from what I gather this seems to be a common timeline. Been into specialty coffee for about four years. Anaerobic blew my mind initially the flavors punch you in the face. Red rooster worka sakaro was the one tasted like strawberry in a great way. But for the past two months I’ve done nothing but light roast washed coffees. Initially I wanted to challenge myself to figure out how to brew better ultra light roasts. I got a bag from hydrangea of an anaerobic on a whim about 3 weeks ago that I opened today and the funk just hit me hard. I brewed nice and easy lower temp lower agitation but it was too much I couldn’t finish it. It’s a high quality bean no off flavors really but the funk was too much. I think i unwittingly converted myself to the lighter side. Weird how senses change and evolve and the scope of coffee flavors can be so different.,26,1742782603.0,pourover,26,0.88,False

1jigbz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jigbz4/girl_takes_forever_to_respond/,Girl takes forever to respond,"Hi guys, I recently met this girl at a party. We were talking for a short while and we seemed to hit it off pretty well. I asked her for her Instagram and she typed it in my phone. I left the party right after because I had somewhere to be and she ended up following me on Instagram literally like 5 min after. I messaged her the next day saying it was nice to meet you and what not and asked if she’d be down to get coffee sometime. She said yes but it would have to be after spring break since she was leaving the next day. Throughout the week we had been texting and the convos seemed to be going really well. The only problem is she takes forever to respond, sometimes a day. She even posted some pictures on Instagram early in the day one time and only responded at night. It seems pretty obvious that she’s not interested anymore however when she does respond, she continues the convo well and asks thoughtful questions back, which is why I am kind of confused. Is she just being nice and should I just take this as a hint and back off?",1,1742782591.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1jigbqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jigbqv/why_cant_i_do_anything/,Why can’t I do anything?,"I’m in a bit of a rut as I haven’t been enjoying my work due to sales pressure (I’m a sales rep). The company is toxic and it has been getting to me. The constant dramas that happen and the amount of communication and micromanagement make me shut down. I’m at the stage where everything I have to deal with is too hard. 
I do suffer from depression but am normally quite functional. Work has always been part of my identity and I would always love to work and take great pride in it. This isn’t normal for me. 
Even tasks like the supermarket or vacuuming is too hard. Writing shopping lists make me shut down. Hobbies have completely left my interest. Instead on the weekend I sit and think. Maybe go for a walk or get a coffee, that is it. 
I’m not entirely sure why I am feeling like this and am looking for some advice on how to deal with it as I feel I might just resign which I can’t really afford to do. help 
Any advice is much appreciated :) ",2,1742782568.0,depression,3,1.0,False
