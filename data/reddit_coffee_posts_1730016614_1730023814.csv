I've had this hardware for years, but I have only really drank espresso in milk drinks. I'm now interested in trying to make good shots of espresso to drink plain, finding and trying good specialty coffee beans, improving the milk drinks I already make, etc., and I've watched a number of videos to try to figure out what I need most to make this a viable (but still affordable) hobby at home.

My question here is pretty much all in the title. Obviously, my machine is on the lower end, so I'm sure it's **a** bottleneck - but I'm also aware that my grinder's adjustments are too large to dial in a roast. Not to mention, I'm led to believe the conical burr could make it difficult to appreciate the separate flavors in a given roast profile compared to a flat burr.^(1)

With all of that in mind, is it more of a priority to upgrade my espresso machine to something in the $500-$1000(+) range, to upgrade my Sette 30 adjustment assembly to the [270's](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Sette-Adjustment-Assembly-UPGRADE/dp/B09NRZNJ4Q), or to upgrade to a \~$500 flat burr entirely? Assuming I eventually upgrade the machine as well as upgrade/buy a grinder, what should my priority be, and within or without those budgets do you have recommendations for my situation?

Thank you!

I've stopped drinking coffee a little over a month ago after drinking it ever since university. I don't remember a time when I wasn't overdoing it. I never really questioned the effects it had on me because I'd forgotten how to even be without it. 

I have noticed some of the positive changes I was hoping for: I am less angry in general (I used to get worked up a lot at work) and my energy is much more stable during the day, but the one thing I wasn't expecting is that I started sleeping less. 

I used to think I had some sort of chronic but non-problematic oversleeping problem. I would always sleep until my alarm, even if I'd put it 10 hours away. I was never up early, even if I went to bed early, which I very often did. I'd feel fine with 7 or 8 hours, but on most nights, I always got more just because I'd sleep early and wake up right before work. So I would sleep 10 or 11 hours a lot, which would sometimes make me drowsier or more tired. 

And all of a sudden, the oversleeping went away. I wasn't expecting it at all as I had assumed it was just how my body worked at this point. I had heard that quitting coffee made you sleep better, but it didn't matter much to me as I always felt like I had good sleep (but did I?). I usually didn't struggle to fall asleep, and always felt like I was getting more than enough, literally. But the week after I stopped coffee, I started getting up between 5:30 and 7 without an alarm, feeling perfectly awake, when I would have woken at 9 with an alarm otherwise. I also started waking up pretty much at the same time everyday, which wasn't the case before. If I go to bed later, I obviously get up later, but still nowhere near as late as I used to.  

The day before yesterday, I had a cup of coffee for the first time since I quit, and I overslept again. The coffee was kind of a test as I was curious to see how it would affect me. I was accompanying a relative at a hospital appointment and they bought me a cup from the hospital vending machine, so I thought I'd drink it. Obviously it was pretty weak coffee, but the day after, I woke up past 10am. 

I'm guessing this is due to better quality sleep and so I need less? Has anyone experienced something similar? I'd always assumed that I could only be a morning bird with coffee, but maybe it's the opposite...

tldr; I used to oversleep regularly and it stopped immediately when I stopped coffee, wondering if anyone has experienced the same.

1gd7ffa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gd7ffa/parents_are_too_forceful_i_feel_trapped/,Parents are too forceful - I feel trapped,"I (22 f) live with my parents. Both my parents are really staunch born again christian's and throughout my life my sister (who now lives in a different country) and I have been expected to follow suit.

let me preface this whole thing by saying that I have a really complicated relationship with faith and God myself. there's a lot to it but when I boil it down I think it comes to the fact that it's something that's been expected of me, forced on me since birth, but i've just never connected with it enough. I do believe in Jesus, and I think i'm finding my own way into a relationship with God, but I know that any relationship I have with God will look much different to my parents' relationships with him.

my parents are not receptive to my struggles at all. I don't know if they're just completely blind or if they ignore it, but I don't hide the fact that I struggle with my faith. in fact, I have openly spoken to them about it recently, when my dad was trying to force me into doing an alpha course and I just didn't want to. of course the discussion I wanted to have about me being an adult and needing to make my own decisions turned into an argument and I got told that I was a disappointment and ended up having to do the course anyway.

I guess this is my problem, I don't know how to get the point across to them that faith is my personal decision, and them trying to force me (what prompted me into writing this post actually is my mom being incredibly angry that I decided not to go to church today) into christian activities and roles really just makes me want nothing to do with it at all. I have told them that I hate this, but they cannot see things from my perspective.

for more context, I cannot move out because I am a university student, so accommodation is almost impossible for me to afford, especially seeing as i'm paying for my degree alongside my parents (which I am grateful for), and I have a disability, which only makes my parents baby me even more.

i'm just incredibly tired of having to fake everything about my life for their sakes. i'm just like a normal person my age. I want to go out with friends and feel okay about doing stuff like drinking and dating but they are so controlling that I feel like the version of me they see is so far from who I really am. my dad even went so far one time as to tell me (after I told my parents I was going for coffee with a friend from university) that I don't need secular friends and shouldn't do that.

I feel completely alone, and it‚Äôs such a hard situation. I love my parents so much, and i‚Äôm incredibly grateful for all that they‚Äôve done and given me in my life, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they haven‚Äôt been hard people to live with. and they have done some things in the past which I won‚Äôt elaborate on, but things that have destroyed my trust in them and shown me that all they really seem to care about is my belief in god. I don‚Äôt think they care about me and what I actually want in my life. they‚Äôre so consumed by me and my sister being christian‚Äôs that they don‚Äôt care if they force us into it. 

I feel so hopeless about this situation. I truly feel like I have no options here, I can't speak to my parents because they are incredibly disrespectful towards anything I feel and are just plain mean and dismissive. how do I get them to see me as an adult who is allowed to make my own decisions? how do I get them to back off on all things regarding faith? I don't want to hurt them in the process of finding my independence but at this point how else do I get out of this loop i'm trapped in? as long as they continue being overbearing and oppressive towards me I will never be in a good place with God. how do I tell them this stuff when I know that they will turn it around on me and make me feel like the worst person alive? I feel like i'm going crazy. I need help and they just can't see that. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do at all. I feel like i‚Äôm drowning. 

if anyone has any advice at all, i‚Äôd be incredibly grateful. and if you read all of this I really appreciate you. it‚Äôs so hard not having someone to talk to about this stuff. I feel so alone.

1gd7dir,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gd7dir/can_i_just_simply_adjust_brew_recipe_to_match_the/,Can I just simply adjust brew recipe to match the water hardness? ,"Hi folks

I used to have a local water source that is cheap and worked very well for coffee brewing without having to add any minerals. Not that this local source tailored water recipe for coffee brewing or anything. I was just lucky. 

However, when I order this time the water from this particular source no longer tastes the same. It tastes flat and dry and astringent. The acidity is dimmed. I suspect the water becomes....softer? 

For a short-term remedy, I resort to bottled water. I found that the brand that I bought has the TDS of 14. Coffee tastes better but remains relatively flat compared to my good old days. In the long run, I still don't know what to do because I am not sure if I'm ready to go into the rabbit hole of water recipes, commercial or DIY.

While I wait until next morning with the intention to grind finer, I guess my question in between is whether it is okay (or comparable) to simply grind finer, adding more agitation, or increase temperature to match with the changing hardness of water? Is it inevitable that I have to install the Reverse Osmosis Filter, buy Epsom Salt, and Baking Soda, and the 0.1g sensitive scale and the TDS meter in the long run? 

Just so you know, my current brewing recipe's grind size is pretty coarse. Like 71 clicks on Q2, using V60, 92c temperature, 1 minute bloom, followed with 2 pores (3 pores in total), 5-6g/sec flow rate. Washed light roast beans. Just descaled the kettle recently so it's unlikely an issue. The recipe worked really well before the water quality changes. 

Thank you in advance.

1gd7bdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ornery_Story_972/comments/1gd7bdm/antistealth_situations_thief_1/,Anti-stealth situations. Thief 1,"**Introduction**

The game is one of my favorites, I play it every year, both the base game and the Fan Missions. Still, I have to say, it still has childhood illnesses, but what game doesn't? In fact, there are a lot of frustrating things in it, although frustration is very individual, everyone's tolerance is different. Even years later, there are fixed situations that for me make the experience of stealth bitter, as I said, stealth can work differently for everyone, for me Splinter Cell and Hitman games are mercilessly difficult, because the mechanics of stealth are not simplified and not so clear, but Thief- in stealth is just so simple and provides a kind of casual experience, which is why I keep coming back to the game. supplemented with various fantasy elements, it made this game even more high-quality for me, in fact, that's why I stick to it even today, since Thief 2, because they created a much more beautiful and varied environment, but it lost a lot of the horror atmosphere, but not negatively. After all, among the FMs there are excellent works that touch heavily on horror, just one of many: ""Rose Cottage"" and the not-so-old 2020...

\------------

I should also add that I am not a good player, I consider myself a particularly weak player, I often lose my focus, I give up quickly, I have phase delays, unfortunately this also holds me back in real life, but this still makes me appreciate and stick with the game as long as I live. So not only professionals can love the game, but also weak players can stick with it, it can give them a delightful experience as well. We are not the same.

However, I never liked its story, it didn't even capture me, I seriously couldn't tell its story even to this day, I'm so not a fan of this story, but that's why I still love the game. This is approx. it's like mario, a minimal story, which consists of saving the princess and getting a kiss from her, and approx. that's all. But I think it's one of the most creative and fun games, I play it all the time. I love Thief for its world and atmosphere and stealth, but not for its story.

\------------

Well, I thought I'd remove the picture and re-edit the post, because I already got the answer in the comments, and there's really no point in keeping it there anymore, because these are subjective gaming experiences, which I'm going to explain here.

On the other hand, the whole post I made was thoughtless on my part, the fact that something frustrates or annoys me in a game, I didn't explain it in more detail, the picture turned out to be terribly small, supplemented by a couple of figures, what I had to say didn't come through, but I don't blame anyone for that, I see my own shortcoming in it, because the message I wanted to present in the picture really doesn't come through from an outside perspective.

**Well, then comes the explanation. Which is completely subjective and completely different from the established mechanics of the game.**

First of all, I would like to state in advance that over the years I have developed a *different style of stealth play,* so e.g. I use water arrow and moss arrow as rarely as possible, because it destroys the realism, in my opinion, as these tools would leave a strong mark, the moss concretely makes the scene dirty, the water arrow is even more acceptable outdoors, but it would leave a strong water mark indoors

I empathize with the guards, but I can no longer cooperate with the monsters, there is sword fighting if necessary...

https://preview.redd.it/d9g4c1n1n9xd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5160c2d09a9acacd5906aeb105c7a943c366bb81

So you can see in the picture that the game suddenly becomes very difficult from one moment to the next, we are still on **stage01**, the location is **LordBaffordManor**,

I am progressing very well with stealth and suddenly I arrive in this room, where I suddenly freeze, there is no moss arrow, there is water - arrow, as a beginner player here, I would mainly use this one, because it is clear, as much as

I would have used the water arrow up to this moment, if not, then the stealth will stop, because I will definitely make a mistake, since I live on a tile surface, I have too few options, and there are a problem in thief 1, our slow walking is not always steady, but suddenly it takes a big step without expecting it, of course, after many years I know that this is part of the game, that it is difficult to do the slow walking, because sometimes it is really big steps and just when I'm next to the guard, it's clear that ""instant death"" or the end of sneakiness.

https://preview.redd.it/26jjie6tp9xd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac3b3b45271b09ca827b080a307ed0d77cc44ce1

So I expect this **stage02 - Break From Cragscleft Prison** to be a bit more difficult, and indeed it is, but my stealth still works until I get here, I'm already ""freezing"" here and I have no idea how to get through when one of the most difficult mechanics is already included:

1 the guard walks around randomly, which makes predictability worse, it's hard,

the fake shadow where I hide I'm still in full light, there's a metallic surface, the noisiest surface, it's also on maximum, the torch can be turned off, it helps, but if I don't want to cross like this, then the guard who turns around randomly will suddenly give me the creeps, and that's it, the point is that everything here is almost mechanically set to difficult, but my statement is not entirely true, because instead of torches, lamps should have been used, which they didn't it can be turned off, and we're only a quarter of the way through stage02.

**There are other annoying parts, I'll add, it's only the worst when I don't use water arrow, if I use it, it's less frustrating:**

https://preview.redd.it/35r7i6muq9xd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7037ab1b9e3321c0ba0383f4fa7cc95f20ca3495

**Stage05: Thiefs Guild**: I like this stage too, but my favorite is still the **Assassins** stage (10/10).

Here I am forced to use the water arrow, only because the cooks walk up and down randomly, because there are two of them, and this makes stealthing very difficult here, if I don't use the water arrow according to my playstyle, then at a very high level I have to burn my brain by downing two coffees to be able to keep an eye on where he is walking. But with a lot of reloading, but if I want to save myself from that, I just put out the torch. This is also an unexpected difficulty pushed into the sky.. for me. I'm nowhere near the pro taffer.

**epilogue**

These are not bad things, I say again, but rather noteworthy stages from the point of view of game development, which moved me out of the stealth experience. The game was released in 1998, many things have changed, it started as a heretic clone, then it wanted to be an RPG game, and then it finally became an action-stealth, as for the action, it came to the end, I have no empathy for the monsters there anymore, the chichi- pooh, done. :)

Thief 2 was created to compensate for these shortcomings of Thief 1, sparing all frustration and difficulty, I think it succeeded and this is a good point in the history of the game. Thanks LookingGlassStudio.üëç",1,1730021868.0,u_Ornery_Story_972,0,1.0,False
1gd7aon,https://i.redd.it/hn8vgtczq9xd1.jpeg,Issue with ratio and output with fellow Aiden ,"So I‚Äôve noticed something today that is somewhat confusing. I chose the guided brew for the verve profile and chose 2 cups (300ml) 18.7grams of coffee. The output however was 256g and not 300g of brewed coffee. I did zero the scale right before the first drop so there‚Äôs not an issue with the scale. I wonder though if there‚Äôs a bug issue or if some of the pre programmed 2cup=300ml disappears as some of it is steam‚Ä¶? Has anyone else encountered this?  Brew finished when 41 seconds was remaining of the brew. 

As far as taste is concerned the coffee tasted great, somewhat strong perhaps but other than that pretty good. I‚Äôm just confused by the output.

I just had a few Q‚Äôs and concerns that I wonder if anyone has the answers to before my prescriber gets in touch‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôve been prescribed methylphenidate MR. I‚Äôm slightly worried about going on a stimulant as I also have anxiety and have had different experiences on various stimulants - e.g I can‚Äôt drink coffee or redbull as they make my heart beat VERY fast and I feel very anxious but also SO sleepy and cannot concentrate. However I once did cocaine and it was the best experience of my life, I felt no anxiety and have never felt so much mental clarity (I never did it again as I know it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd find hard to stop). I‚Äôm not sure if it will be similar to either of these things but if anyone has any idea if it could cause similar anxiety to caffeine a heads up would be great so I can prepare.

Generally, how easy is it to continue working etc. during titration? I WFH most days and my job is very chill so not worried about getting in trouble, but I do have a fairly high workload and I‚Äôm concerned about struggling to do anything during the day. 

I‚Äôm also worried that it just won‚Äôt work for me at all as I‚Äôve been on numerous antidepressants in my life and haven‚Äôt felt a single thing on any of them üòÖ I know that it only lasts 12 weeks so what if I don‚Äôt find something that works for me in those 12 weeks??

They are in 7th grade now. Our families have been friends since that time as well and invite each other here and there over the last several years. The mom and I are friends and have had spa days together, go out for breakfast or coffee every so often. We always talk about how we want the girls to have friends and worry about them not having friends or feeling included, etc. We try to get the girls together for birthdays and other events. I am also their troop leader for Girl Scouts.

This year, the mom told me that she didn't get a chance to do something for her daughter's birthday due to her work schedule. So, I offered to take her daughter and my daughter out for dinner and a fun evening. I got the girl balloons, a card and took them to a nice restaurant where the wait staff sang to her and put a candle in her dessert, etc. Afterwards, I took them to Target and told B to pick out any gift she'd like for $50. She picked a few things, then changed her mind and said she wanted an Amazon card which I was totally fine with. The stores that had Amazon cards were closed as it was 10pm at the time and Target didn't sell Amazon cards. So, I told her I'd bring her the card in a few days at our next scout meeting which I did. Girls seemed to have a great time laughing and joking. They seemed so happy.

I thought I did something nice for the girl since she didn't get to have a birthday party or anything, and I was happy that both my daughter and she had a great time.

A week later, today, I was taking the girl scout troop to an escape room. B was in the car with us and talking with another girl. I'll call her C, about how they did an escape room that they did together last week with 2 friends from school (where my daughter goes too). Turns out B invited C and a few friends the next day after I took her out, to have a small party at an escape room. I didn't say anything or mention anything. I just said, oh that sounds fun. Then she proceeded to tell me that she didn't invite my daughter to join because she thought my daughter wouldn't like escape rooms because it wasn't shopping at Target (insinuating that my daughter isn't smart or cool enough to do escape rooms and ditsy only wanting to shop at Target). Then I said nicely, well she enjoyed it today (they had just finished and we were driving home - my daughter loved it and was very involved in solving the mystery, etc.). Then B said, well, my friend that I invited doesn't like to make new friends (but my daughter knows that girl well). I told B very kindly, she didn't have to justify anything and doesn't have to explain (she was the one who brought up the escape room and then started defending her actions).

In any case, I told myself internally that people are not obligated to invite my daughter. Sometimes people can't invite everyone, etc. My daughter thankfully didn't hear the conversation as she was further back in the car talking to other girls. I keep trying to tell myself I don't have a right to be upset. But I can't help but feel angry. The day before, I went all out taking her out and trying to help her have a nice birthday, meanwhile, she plans one and doesn't invite my child. I even go get her an Amazon card for $50 and give it to her at our scout meeting. Then, I am driving them around as the scout leader, and her mom doesn't include my daughter in an event that is the very next day!  Sorry, I am just venting. I feel like I do so much for others to make them happy but then they leave my daughter out. My daughter is a sweet girl. She can be shy, but she is kind and fun as I witnessed when I took the two girls out and at the troop event. I am just hurt for her and upset with my friend that she didn't think to include my daughter.

1gd75tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamemaker/comments/1gd75tm/script_executes_again_after_return_statement/,Script executes again after RETURN statement - SOLVED,"I was about to ask for help when I band-aid solved it. So here it is in case anyone ever runs into it.

So I've had this script, which is pretty much a complete copy of this [official gamemaker tutorial](https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/coffee-break-tutorial-easy-typewriter-dialogue-gml), with some extra local variables for easier reading. For some reason, the script was executing twice. I have debugged around it, the script was not called twice by any other event.

It reached the `return` statement at the end of the script with the proper output, then instead of exiting, started the script over once more, with the proper output as the starting point, mangling it again.

    /// functionstring_wrap(text, width);
    /// param  {string}    text    The text to wrap
    /// param  {real}      width   The maximum width of the text before a line break is inserted
    /// descriptionTake a string and add line breaks so that it doesn't overflow the maximum width
    function scrStringWrap(_text, _width) {
    var _text_wrapped = """";
    var _space = -1; //location of the space character, we start with a ""false""
    var _char_pos = 1; //counter to see where we are, string_copy starts at 1, unlike an array
    var _full_length = string_length(_text);
    while (_full_length >= _char_pos) {
    var _copied_string = string_copy(_text, 1, _char_pos);
    var _copied_width = string_width(_copied_string);
    if (_copied_width > _width) {
    if (_space != -1) {
    _text_wrapped += string_copy(_text, 1, _space) + ""\n"";
    _text = string_copy(_text, _space + 1, string_length(_text) - (_space));
    _char_pos = 1;
    _space = -1;
    }
    };
    if (string_char_at(_text,_char_pos) == "" "") {
    _space = _char_pos;
    };
    _char_pos += 1;
    };
    if (string_length(_text) > 0) {
    _text_wrapped += _text;
    };
    return _text_wrapped;
    }

I feel like it is a bug in the system, but the issue was that the script had `_text` both as a parameter, and as local variable inside of the script. So renaming the variable inside of the script, in this case the `_text = string_copy(_text, _space + 1, string_length(_text) - (_space));`

to `_text_the_rest = string_copy(yaddayadda)` did the trick.",3,1730021181.0,gamemaker,1,1.0,False

Unfortunately, the books that I thought would appeal to me turned out to be boring.

My taste:
I enjoy books about military, war, politics and business. I also read some otome isekai and danmei.

I would prefer if the main character is strong willed, not a pushover and physically strong as well as mentally strong. Would prefer if they are morally grey or black.

The main character should have a big goal (I,e winning a war, becoming rich or powerful, becoming a monarch etc) and ideals.

I would prefer no romance and a plot driven story.

But if there is romance, then I would prefer if the love interest is not domineering and has a lovable personality in a way that complements our MC. Would prefer if the love interest has a moral compass and a good person. I want that golden retriever energy. Would prefer if the romance is a small part of the overall story. 

I have read a few books where the powerful protagonist becomes a damsel in distress when the love interest appears and I HATE that.

Would prefer if the main character faces adversity. 

Would prefer if the main character is smart and cunning and capable of solving their problems.

No slice of life. No, wanting to open a coffee shop is not a big goal.

Ein Toffee Nut Coffee ist ein Kaffeegetr√§nk, das mit einem Sirup aus Karamell- und Nussaromen verfeinert wird. Die Aromen von Toffee (Karamellbonbons) und Nuss verleihen dem Kaffee eine s√º√ülich-nussige Note und machen ihn zu einer beliebten Wahl in der k√§lteren Jahreszeit, besonders zur Herbst- und Winterzeit.

Das Getr√§nk kann auf verschiedene Weisen zubereitet werden z.b.: 

1. Hei√üer Toffee Nut Latte: Moinkaffee mit  aufgesch√§umter Milch verr√ºhren, fertig. 
Vielleicht noch zus√§tzlich mit Sahne und Karamell- oder Nuss-Topping.


2. Eiskalter Toffee Nut Latte: Die kalte Variante wird mit Eisw√ºrfeln zubereitet und bietet denselben nussigen Geschmack in einem erfrischenden Format.


Der Toffee Nut Coffee ist vor allem durch Ketten wie Starbucks bekannt geworden, die ihn regelm√§√üig in der Wintersaison anbieten.

Yesterday I was in Boots spraying away at different perfumes, mostly on card but a couple that I was really interested in went on my skin. I ended up becoming quite nose blind, and smelling of a mixture of different scents which wasn't helpful at all. 

Additionally, I was recently on holiday in Majorca and found a bottle of Moschino Fresh which I really like, but I didn't end up buying it because when I sprayed it on my skin it smelled weird (I was wearing suncream at the time and I think the two combined). I regret not buying it as a result.

1gd6why,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gd6why/is_she_interested/,Is she interested? ,"It has been years since I broke up and lost confidence to meet/talk properly to a girl. Today while traveling by air, a girl sat beside me middle seat (me in aisle another dude same age I guess in window). 

Me minding my own business (reading manhua the whole way blasting through calvin Harris songs) with occasional peeks to her (natural male instinct) the whole flight was smooth.

During the decent to land I was peeking to the window a lot the see if we reached or not (if I can see the land from above) and basically ignoring her cuz it might feel rude to stare at her a lot, suddenly I felt someone poked my arm twice. I saw my right removed my üéß and I hear her asking what manga was I reading earlier.

This made me think she was willing to talk and we started random talk. I had to wait at arrivals for my mum and she had a connecting flight which was 3 hrs later so I asked her for some coffee and conversation. The conversation was smooth and an hr went by smoothly. 

Atlast even I forgot the time and it was 10-15 min more than my mum landed from other flight she told me herself that ur mum must have landed and I should leave too. Before leaving I asked her social and we shaked hand me finally telling that maybe we can meet later after we come back (basically we both went to our hometown and lived the same city hence somtime we meet later)

I know for lot of u this question might be crazy noob but for me after last breakup it's hard to even meet new people.

Maybe this might help boost my morale so any experienced person or went through almost same situation need ur earger help ( good and bad both)

Also if any smooth talkers give hints or convo starter if ur suggesting I send her message to social (if I am doing this wrong please correct me about that too)",1,1730020019.0,dating,1,1.0,False

Illuminating every shadow within. /

Sinking yourself with all my pain. /

1gd6rdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1gd6rdt/fast_food_companies_are_so_desperate_for_workers/,Fast food companies are so desperate for workers they are hiring people who can't speak English in the US,"I go to McDonalds once in awhile either for ice cream or coffee. 

I wanted a carmel mocha. Literally just coffee with a squirt of caramel and chocolate and maybe a bit of milk too. I went through the drive through and heard a very strong Spanish voice from the speaker. I said what I wanted, and they got very confused. So, I didn't realize that McDonald's changed their menu apparently since I last ordered this years ago, so to a native Spanish speaker, I guess my order must have been confusing since they don't have caramel mochas on the menu anymore. It's called something else now. But what really got me was they this person didn't even know what a mocha was. They got really confused, and I was like, yeah I want a mocha with caramel. I had successfully ordered this at this McDonald's before the week prior, so I knew it was possible. But they got the order wrong and gave me a blended drink instead. This happened twice when I went to this McDonalds. 

Then I went to a different McDonalds and ordered a drink. The lady there was a Spanish speaker and their accent was a little hard to understand. I remember there was a bit of confusion there too, but she was overall a nice worker.

Then yesterday, I went to Wendy's because they have Krabby Patties there. Crazy, I know. I knew it was just a regular burger, but I wanted to get it so I could tell others that I had tried a Krabby Patty. Anyways, so I just wanted the burger, not the meal, but I guess that isn't possible? I wouldn't know because, guess what? There was a language barrier. Everyone working there was Spanish, but I when I asked the lady at the register if I could get just the burger, instead of telling me that it wasn't possible, she instead placed an order for the whole meal. 

I work with bilingual people at my job, so I'm used to hearing a Spanish accent and it's not that hard to understand. But I'm floored at how many fast food places have Spanish workers that can't speak English in a northern state where the most popular language is English! If you live in an area where the most popular language is \_ and it's spoken by everyone, shouldn't you learn that language? 

If I lived in another country like Japan, I would have to learn the language. It only makes sense because I've surrounded by people that mostly speak Japanese. I know English is pretty well known over there too, but Japanese is the norm. 

Overall, I shouldn't be eating at fast food restaurants anyway, because their food is awful and they do not care about the health of the public.

My higher self reached out to me, inviting me to leave this simulation we call reality. I feel an overwhelming confusion; I don‚Äôt know what to do. Before sleeping, I had spent a long time meditating, searching for answers to the essence of existence itself, and now, at 2:30 in the morning, I‚Äôve woken from what might have been a dream... but it felt so real, so visceral, as if every fiber of my being had truly experienced it.

This presence told me that my time in this earthly world had come to an end, that it was time to return home, to the place we all come from. But I was given a choice: to stay or to go. I‚Äôm standing at a crossroads, like Neo facing a choice in *The Matrix*. I don‚Äôt know what decision to make. If I go back to sleep, will the offer come again? I‚Äôm tired of this world, yet the unknown beyond terrifies me. Will I leave in a physical sense, abandoning this body? Or will only my soul transcend?

I don‚Äôt know if I should accept the invitation or cling a little longer to this existence. I‚Äôm tempted to make myself some coffee, to fight against sleep to avoid making that choice again... and yet, at the same time, I feel a peace within me, as if part of me already knows my fate.

If anyone has a word of guidance for this moment, I‚Äôd be grateful. And if you never hear from me again, it will be because I‚Äôve chosen to leave.

Writing in my blog and reddit has been a beautiful experience, a bridge to share my thoughts and emotions. If I go, I hope one day we meet again in another realm. And if I decide to stay, I‚Äôll keep writing.",3,1730019164.0,spirituality,6,0.8,False

I am wondering if there is anyone around Plymouth who speaks Spanish that would be happy to help me practice conversation with them.

I had a friend in Plymouth but he has moved back to Spain for work and I miss practicing the language with him a lot. I am around a level B1 at present.

I know people may suggest Duolingo (I do use this but it's not the be all and end all) and suggest getting a Spanish tutor, but I'd like to learn on more of a friendship basis than a teacher student scenario.

I'd be happy to buy coffee and nibbles at a coffee shop in exchange for any help :)

I‚Äôm not going to weigh myself Wednesday but I will next Sunday. 

First off, reduced food noise and not feeling bothered by food is a miracle I could only dream of, as someone who usually obsesses over food. Some little things I have encountered, can anyone advise how to get round the first one?

1. Brain fog and having early nights, nothing substantial but I catch myself at work zoning out but then again I am bored beyond belief at work. Find myself quite tired a bit earlier than normal, is this due to reduced food intake?

2. Not going to the loo as much, I‚Äôm eating smaller amounts so naturally won‚Äôt be going, I am drinking a lot of water to combat this though. 

3. Suppression seems to be strongest morning to late afternoon and I could be inclined to have something in the evening, I have managed not to so it‚Äôs probably working more than I realise. I have got
Protein bars at the waiting.

My regime is essentially 10,000 steps, weight training or cardio and around 1200 calories a day. Usually protein and vegetable, whilst avoiding too many carbs. 

One thing I have noticed is Pepsi Max tasting quite sweet, I used to drink 2 litres or less a day, quite easy with a pint glass. I have stopped drinking it because I‚Äôm worried about it spiking insulin and making mounjaro not work? I see a lot of conflicting information regarding Pepsi max or diet drinks‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôve left it be. I‚Äôd love to still drink the same amount I can‚Äôt lie, as it was always a vice, I don‚Äôt drink alcohol and I don‚Äôt smoke, I have never done drugs. 

I love a morning coffee too, and wondering if I should avoid that too now? I‚Äôm very open minded and committed to making this work. 

Sorry for the overload of information! Any help and advice would be phenomenal!

","I first laid eyes on Sandra at our local coffee shop, The Brew Haven. She was sitting at the counter, her long, auburn hair cascading down her back, and her hazel eyes scanning a book. I couldn't help but notice her slim figure and the way her smile lit up the room when she laughed at something she read. I couldn't resist the urge to introduce myself.

""Mind if I sit here?"" I asked, gesturing to the stool next to her.

She looked up, her eyes meeting mine, and smiled. ""Not at all.""

""I'm Jake,"" I said, extending my hand.

""Sandra,"" she replied, shaking my hand. ""Nice to meet you, Jake.""

We spent the next hour talking about everything and nothing. I learned she was an art student at the local college, and I told her about my job as a graphic designer. She was funny, intelligent, and had a laugh that could make anyone feel at ease.

Over the next few weeks, we met up regularly, always at The Brew Haven. Our conversations grew deeper, and our laughter more frequent. I found myself looking forward to these meetings more than anything. I started to feel something more than just friendship, but I wasn't sure if she felt the same way.

One afternoon, as we sat in our usual spots, I worked up the courage to ask her out on a proper date. ""How about dinner on Friday?"" I suggested.

She looked at me, her eyes sparkling. ""I'd like that, Jake.""

Friday night arrived, and I picked her up at her apartment. She looked stunning in a little black dress that highlighted her curves. We went to a cozy Italian restaurant, where we shared a bottle of wine and laughed over stories from our past. The chemistry between us was electric, and I could feel the tension building as the night went on.

After dinner, we walked back to her place, hand in hand. As we stood outside her door, she turned to face me. ""Would you like to come in for a drink?"" she asked softly.

I nodded, my heart pounding in my chest. We stepped inside, and she poured us each a glass of wine. We sat on the couch, our bodies close, and started to kiss. It was soft and gentle at first, but it quickly became more passionate. Our tongues danced together, and I could taste the wine on her lips.

""You taste amazing,"" I whispered, pulling her closer.

She smiled against my lips. ""So do you.""

Our hands began to explore each other's bodies. I ran my fingers through her hair, while she traced the lines of my jaw with her fingertips. I could feel her breath on my neck as she began to kiss and nibble on my earlobe.

""I've wanted to do this since the first time I saw you,"" she whispered.

I let out a low groan, my cock already hardening in my pants. ""Me too,"" I replied.

She stood up and took my hand, leading me to her bedroom. As soon as we were inside, she turned to face me and started to undress me. She unbuttoned my shirt slowly, her fingers brushing against my chest, making me shiver with anticipation.

""You have an amazing body,"" she said, her eyes scanning my chest.

I smiled, feeling a wave of confidence wash over me. ""So do you,"" I said, letting my hands explore her curves.

She slipped out of her dress, revealing a black lace bra and matching thong. I could see the outline of her nipples through the fabric, and I couldn't resist the urge to touch them. I reached behind her and unhooked her bra, letting it fall to the floor. Her breasts were perfect, with small, pink nipples that begged to be sucked. I obliged, taking one into my mouth and swirling my tongue around it.

""Oh god, Jake,"" she moaned, her hands gripping my hair.

I moved to the other nipple, giving it the same attention. I could feel her body trembling under my touch, and I knew she was getting just as turned on as I was.

I lowered my hand to her panties, rubbing her pussy through the fabric. She was already soaking wet, and I could feel her heat through the thin material. I slipped a finger inside her, and she let out a soft moan.

""You're so wet,"" I whispered.

She nodded, her eyes filled with desire. ""I want you inside me, Jake.""

I slipped off her thong, revealing her perfectly shaved pussy. I could see her clit peeking out from under its hood, and I leaned down to give it a gentle lick. She gasped, her hips bucking against my face.

""That feels so good,"" she whispered.

I continued to lick and suck on her clit, my fingers exploring her wet folds. She was writhing against me, her moans growing louder with each passing second. I could feel her getting closer to the edge, and I wanted to be inside her when she came.

I stood up and quickly undressed, my cock rock hard and ready. I grabbed a condom from my wallet and put it on, then turned to face her. She was lying on the bed, her legs spread wide, inviting me in.

I climbed onto the bed and positioned myself between her legs. I rubbed the head of my cock against her wet pussy, teasing her.

""You're driving me crazy,"" she whispered.

I smiled and slowly pushed myself inside her. She was tight, and I could feel every inch of her pussy as I slid deeper.

""Oh god, Jake,"" she moaned. ""That feels amazing.""

I started to move, slowly at first, then faster and harder as she urged me on. I could feel her nails digging into my back, and I knew she was close to coming.

""Harder, Jake,"" she begged. ""Faster.""

I obliged, my cock slamming into her with force. I could feel her pussy clenching around me, and I knew she was close.

""I'm going to come,"" she whispered.

I leaned down and captured her mouth in a passionate kiss as she came, her body shaking with the force of her orgasm. I continued to thrust into her, my own orgasm building with each stroke.

""Come with me, Jake,"" she whispered.

I couldn't hold back any longer. I thrust into her one last time and came, my body shaking with the force of my orgasm. I collapsed on top of her, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

We lay there for a moment, our bodies still joined, before I slowly pulled out of her. I could see the satisfied smile on her face, and I knew that this was just the beginning of something amazing.

We lay in bed together, our bodies entwined, as we talked and laughed. I could feel her breath on my chest, and I knew that I wanted to stay with her forever.

As we drifted off to sleep, I knew that this night was just the start of something special. I couldn't wait to see what the future held for us.

The next morning, we woke up to the sound of her alarm clock. She rolled over and smiled at me, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

""Good morning,"" she said, her voice husky with sleep.

I smiled back at her. ""Morning.""

She leaned in and kissed me, her hand reaching down to stroke my cock, which was already hard again.

""I want you to fuck my face this time,"" she whispered.

I raised my eyebrows, surprised but excited by her request. I rolled onto my back, and she positioned herself between my legs, her mouth inches from my cock.

She looked up at me, her eyes filled with desire. ""Is this okay?"" she asked.

I nodded, my breath catching in my throat. ""Yeah, it's okay.""

She took my cock in her hand and guided it to her mouth, her tongue swirling around the head before she took me in deep. I let out a low moan, my hands tangling in her hair as she began to suck me off.

She was amazing at it, her mouth moving up and down my shaft, her tongue swirling around the sensitive head. I could feel my orgasm building, and I knew I wouldn't last long.

""I'm going to come,"" I warned her.

She looked up at me, her eyes filled with determination. ""Come in my mouth,"" she whispered.

I couldn't hold back any longer. I thrust my hips up, my cock deep in her throat as I came. She swallowed every drop, her eyes watering slightly as she took it all.

I pulled her up to me, kissing her deeply. ""That was amazing,"" I whispered.

She smiled, her cheeks flushed with excitement. ""I'm glad you liked it.""

We lay in bed for a while longer, talking and laughing before we finally got up to start our day. As we showered together, I couldn't help but feel a sense of contentment wash over me. I knew that this was the start of something special, and I couldn't wait to see where this relationship would take us.

Over the next few weeks, our relationship continued to grow stronger. We spent as much time together as possible, exploring each other's bodies and learning what made the other tick. One night, as we were getting ready to go out to dinner, Sandra had an idea.

""You know, I've always wanted to try something a little different,"" she said, a mischievous smile on her face.

""Oh yeah?"" I replied, raising an eyebrow. ""What do you have in mind?""

She bit her lip, her eyes sparkling with excitement. ""How about we have sex on the toilet seat?""

I laughed, taken aback by her suggestion. ""The toilet seat?""

She nodded, her smile growing wider. ""Yeah, I think it could be kinky and fun.""

I smiled back at her, intrigued by her idea. ""Alright, let's do it.""

We skipped dinner and went straight to her apartment. As soon as we were inside, she led me to the bathroom and closed the door behind us. She sat down on the toilet seat and spread her legs, inviting me in.

I stepped between her legs and began to kiss her, our tongues dancing together as we explored each other's mouths. I could feel her hands roaming my body, her fingers tracing the lines of my muscles.

I broke away from her kiss and began to trail kisses down her neck, my hands reaching up to cup her breasts. I took one into my mouth, sucking and biting gently on her nipple.

""Oh god, Jake,"" she moaned, her hips bucking against me.

I moved to the other breast, giving it the same attention. I could feel her body trembling under my touch, and I knew she was getting just as turned on as I was.

I lowered my hand to her pussy, rubbing her through her panties. She was already soaking wet, and I could feel her heat through the thin material. I slipped a finger inside her, and she let out a soft moan.

""That was so much fun,"" she said, her voice breathless.

I smiled back at her, my heart filled with happiness. ""It really was.""

We cleaned up and got dressed, our bodies still tingling from the amazing sex we had just had. As we left the bathroom, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement wash over me. I knew that this was just the start of something special, and I couldn't wait to see what other adventures awaited us.

Over the next few weeks, our sex life continued to grow more and more adventurous. We tried new positions, new locations, and even new toys. One night, as we were lying in bed, Sandra turned to face me, her eyes filled with a mischievous gleam.

""You know what I've been thinking about lately?"" she asked, her voice husky with desire.

I raised an eyebrow, intrigued. ""What's that?""

She bit her lip, her cheeks flushing with excitement. ""I've been thinking about giving you a handjob while you fuck my face.""

I let out a low groan, my cock already hardening at the thought. ""That sounds amazing.""

She smiled and leaned in to kiss me, her hand reaching down to stroke my cock through my boxers. I could feel it growing harder and harder under her touch, and I knew that I wanted to feel her hand wrapped around it.

I quickly undressed, my cock rock hard and ready. She took it in her hand, her fingers wrapping around the shaft as she began to stroke me slowly. I let out a low moan, my head falling back against the pillow as I savored the sensation.

She continued to stroke me, her hand moving up and down my shaft with perfect rhythm. I could feel my orgasm building, and I knew I wouldn't last much longer.

""I'm going to come,"" I warned her.

She looked up at me, her eyes filled with determination. ""Come on my hand, Jake.""

I couldn't hold back any longer. I thrust my hips up, my cock exploding in her hand as I came. She continued to stroke me, milking every last drop from me. I let out a low groan, my body shaking with the force of my orgasm.

She brought her hand up to her mouth and licked my cum off her fingers, her eyes locked onto mine. ""That was so hot,"" she whispered.

I smiled back at her, my heart filled with happiness. ""It really was.""

We lay in bed together, our bodies entwined, as we talked and laughed. I could feel her breath on my chest, and I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.

1gd6nuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1gd6nuh/aitah/,AITAH,"My daughter has been friends with a girl since kindergarten, I will call her B. They are in 7th grade now. Our families have been friends since that time as well and invite each other here and there over the last several years. The mom and I are friends and have had spa days together, go out for breakfast or coffee every so often. We always talk about how we want the girls to have friends and worry about them not having friends or feeling included, etc. We try to get the girls together for birthdays and other events. I am also their troop leader for Girl Scouts. 

This year, the mom told me that she didn't get a chance to do something for her daughter's birthday due to her work schedule. So, I offered to take her daughter and my daughter out for dinner and a fun evening. I got the girl balloons, a card and took them to a nice restaurant where the wait staff sang to her and put a candle in her dessert, etc. Afterwards, I took them to Target and told B to pick out any gift she'd like for $50. She picked a few things, then changed her mind and said she wanted an Amazon card which I was totally fine with. The stores that had Amazon cards were closed as it was 10pm at the time and Target didn't sell Amazon cards. So, I told her I'd bring her the card in a few days at our next scout meeting which I did. Girls seemed to have a great time laughing and joking. They seemed so happy. 

I thought I did something nice for the girl since she didn't get to have a birthday party or anything, and I was happy that both my daughter and she had a great time. 

A week later, today, I was taking the girl scout troop to an escape room. B was in the car with us and talking with another girl. I'll call her C, about how they did an escape room that they did together last week with 2 friends from school (where my daughter goes too). Turns out B invited C and a few friends the next day after I took her out, to have a small party at an escape room. I didn't say anything or mention anything. I just said, oh that sounds fun. Then she proceeded to tell me that she didn't invite my daughter to join because she thought my daughter wouldn't like escape rooms because it wasn't shopping at Target (insinuating that my daughter isn't smart or cool enough to do escape rooms and ditsy only wanting to shop at Target). Then I said nicely, well she enjoyed it today (they had just finished and we were driving home - my daughter loved it and was very involved in solving the mystery, etc.). Then B said, well, my friend that I invited doesn't like to make new friends (but my daughter knows that girl well). I told B very kindly, she didn't have to justify anything and doesn't have to explain (she was the one who brought up the escape room and then started defending her actions). 

In any case, I told myself internally that people are not obligated to invite my daughter. Sometimes people can't invite everyone, etc. My daughter thankfully didn't hear the conversation as she was further back in the car talking to other girls. I keep trying to tell myself I don't have a right to be upset. But I can't help but feel angry. The day before, I went all out taking her out and trying to help her have a nice birthday, meanwhile, she plans one and doesn't invite my child. I even go get her an Amazon card for $50 and give it to her at our scout meeting. Then, I am driving them around as the scout leader, and her mom doesn't include my daughter in an event that is the very next day! AITAH for feeling hurt and somewhat angry that she would say, I didn't invite her because I didn't think she'd like it since it wasn't shopping at Target??? Sorry, I am just venting. I feel like I do so much for others to make them happy but then they leave my daughter out. My daughter is a sweet girl. She can be shy, but she is kind and fun as I witnessed when I took the two girls out and at the troop event.

","I was standing in the lobby of my office building, waiting for the elevator to take me to my floor. It was a typical Monday morning, and the last thing on my mind was anything other than my morning coffee and the pile of work awaiting me. The elevator doors slid open, and in walked the most stunning man I had ever seen. He was tall, with dark hair and piercing blue eyes that seemed to hold a world of mystery. I couldn't help but stare.

""Good morning,"" he said with a smile, his voice deep and smooth. ""You're on the 15th floor, right?""

I was taken aback, but managed to nod. ""Yes, I am.""

""Mind if I join you?"" he asked, a hint of mischief in his eyes.

""Sure,"" I replied, stepping into the elevator and pressing the button for my floor.

The elevator began to ascend, and I could feel the tension growing between us. He stepped closer, his hand brushing against mine. ""You know, I've seen you around before,"" he said, his voice low and seductive. ""But I don't believe we've officially met. I'm Lucas.""

""I'm Natalie,"" I managed to say, my heart racing.

He leaned in, his breath hot on my ear. ""Natalie,"" he whispered, ""you're even more beautiful up close.""

I felt a shiver run down my spine. ""Thank you,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

The elevator came to a stop, and the doors opened. Lucas took my hand, his fingers intertwining with mine. ""How about we get coffee sometime?"" he asked.

I nodded, unable to find the words. ""I'd like that,"" I finally said.

A few days later, we found ourselves sitting in a cozy caf√©, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filling the air. Lucas was charming and witty, and I found myself laughing more than I had in a long time. As the morning wore on, the tension between us grew.

""You know,"" he said, leaning in, ""I've been thinking about you all week. About what I want to do to you.""

I felt my cheeks flush. ""Is that so?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded, his eyes darkening. ""Yes. I want to kiss you, Natalie. I want to taste every inch of your body.""

I leaned in, our lips meeting in a deep, passionate kiss. His tongue explored my mouth, sending shivers down my spine. I could feel the heat between us, the desire growing with each passing second.

""Your place or mine?"" he asked, his voice husky.

""Yours,"" I replied, unable to contain my excitement.

We made our way to his apartment, our bodies pressed tightly against each other. As soon as the door closed behind us, he was on me, his hands exploring my body. I could feel the bulge in his pants, the evidence of his desire.

He led me to his bedroom, his hands never leaving my body. He pushed me gently onto the bed, his body covering mine. We kissed passionately, our tongues dancing together. I could feel his hard cock pressing against my thigh, and I wanted it inside me more than anything.

He broke away from my lips, his mouth trailing down my neck, his teeth nibbling on my earlobe. I moaned softly, my hips arching against him. He continued his journey down my body, his lips finding my nipples. He bit gently, sending shockwaves of pleasure through me. I gasped, my hands gripping the sheets.

He looked up at me, a wicked grin on his face. ""You like that, don't you?"" he asked.

I nodded, my breath coming in short gasps.

He continued his journey down my body, his lips finding my pussy. He licked and sucked, his tongue driving me wild. I could feel my orgasm building, my body tensing. He slipped two fingers inside me, curling them just the right way. I came with a scream, my body convulsing with pleasure.

He moved up my body, his cock hard and ready. He slipped inside me slowly, his eyes never leaving mine. I could feel every inch of him, filling me completely. He began to move, his hips thrusting against mine. I wrapped my legs around him, pulling him deeper inside me.

""Fuck me, Lucas,"" I moaned, my hips meeting his thrust for thrust.

He picked up the pace, his cock sliding in and out of me with ease. I could feel my orgasm building again, the pleasure overwhelming. He leaned down, his mouth finding mine. We kissed passionately, our bodies moving in sync.

I could feel him getting close, his body tensing. I wanted to taste him, to feel him cum inside my mouth. I pulled away from him, my hand wrapping around his cock. I stroked him slowly, my eyes locked on his. He groaned, his body shuddering.

I leaned down, my mouth finding his cock. I took him deep, my tongue swirling around the head. He groaned again, his hands gripping my hair. I could taste him, feel him growing harder in my mouth. I took him deeper, my nose pressing against his abdomen. He came with a shout, his cock pulsing in my mouth. I swallowed every drop, my eyes locked on his.

We collapsed onto the bed, our bodies slick with sweat. He pulled me close, his arms wrapping around me. We lay there for a moment, our bodies pressed tightly together.

""That was incredible,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

He smiled, his eyes darkening. ""Just wait,"" he said. ""We're just getting started.""",1,1730018287.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False

As I sit here, pen in hand, my heart races with anticipation. I imagine a love story that transcends time and distance a tale woven with threads of laughter, shared dreams, and stolen glances. Let me paint our canvas with the hues of romance, and together, we'll create a masterpiece.

üåü **Picnics Under the Sun:**
Imagine us on a sunny afternoon, nestled in a cozy corner of the park. The checkered blanket spreads beneath us, and we feast on strawberries, cheese, and laughter. Our fingers brush as we reach for the same grape, and in that simple touch, I feel the universe conspiring to bring us closer.

üåÜ **Weekend Escapes:**
Weekends are our secret elixir‚Äîthe antidote to mundane routines. I envision us escaping to quaint towns, hand in hand. We'll explore cobblestone streets, sip coffee in hidden caf√©s, and dance under moonlit squares. Our hearts will collect memories like seashells on a shore, each one a testament to our love.

üåô **Late Nights and Starry Skies:**
When the world sleeps, we'll be awake. Our conversations will stretch into the night, fueled by vulnerability and curiosity. We'll share childhood stories, our fears, and the constellations we've named after each other. And when fatigue tugs at our eyelids, I'll whisper, ""Stay a little longer; the stars are listening.""

üåê **The Long-Distance Symphony:**
Distance won't dim our flame; it'll stoke it. Our love letters will traverse oceans, carrying promises and longing. We'll synchronize our playlists, so when you listen to that song, you'll know I'm humming along. And when we finally reunite, our embrace will rewrite the laws of physics two souls collapsing into one.

üìú **Our True Love Story:**
Our story won't be a fairy tale it'll be better. It'll be the kind where we stumble, learn, and grow. We'll celebrate anniversaries of first kisses, silly arguments, and the day we decided to be each other's forever. And when wrinkles grace our faces, we'll sit on our porch swing, reminiscing about the journey that led us here.

üåπ **In Closing:**
So, my dear future girlfriend/wife, let's embark on this adventure. Whether our love blooms across continents or flourishes in the same neighborhood, I promise to cherish every moment. You are the unwritten chapter in my heart, and I can't wait to fill those pages with laughter, love, and shared sunsets.

Yours, forever and always,

We both met in clg 2nd year as 1st year was in covid lockdown. She is a muslim and I am a Hindu. For us, it was love at first sight but it took time to realize those feelings. Our common friends warned me about her as her family is very traditional but I wanted to hear it from her so I asked her out on a date. Had a good talk with coffee. I asked her generally will her parents accept if she liked somebody from the other faith and she told me that she can convince her parents. Eventually we got in a relationship and she admitted to liking me too from the first time we met. I was very serious about her and had planned everything from impressing her parents and doing everything in my power to be liked by her parents. I always felt really protective of her even before we started dating.

I regularly went to the gym to look good, I studied hard and even started working part-time and investing to earn some money for our future. We both loved each other and even lost our virginity to each other in 3rd year. We shared everything with each other, there were no secrets between us. We both respected each other's faith and I told her I will never ask her to change her faith or change her diet for me because I like everything about her. In our college placements, we both got placed. I cracked a 20+ LPA SDE job and she unfortunately got less than she deserved around 4.5 LPA but even if she didn't get a job I would have taken care of everything. We both went to different cities for work around January. I surprised her by visiting her in April.

Everything was going perfect then around June, she started talking less to me and even started avoiding me, eventually I asked her what's wrong and she told me that she knew that things will have to end between us one day because her parents will never accept a Hindu guy. I asked her why she is already giving up and she told me that she always knew but hid this from me because she loved me. I was angry. I felt like my world has shattered. I asked her to take her time and think about this and not rush her decision. She started responding hours after my texts and sometimes not replying at all. 2 weeks back I had asked her how she is feeling and she told me ""Bhai, you should move on to somebody who would actually be good for you and stop texting me."" BC itna ganda kata h na mera. I just feel like a part of me has died and I don't know if I will ever be able to love someone like I loved her.",5,1730018184.0,RelationshipIndia,4,0.78,False

Unfortunately, the books that I thought would appeal to me turned out to be boring.

My taste:
I enjoy books about military, war, politics and business. I also read some otome isekai and danmei.

I would prefer if the main character is strong willed, not a pushover and physically strong as well as mentally strong. Would prefer if they are morally grey or black.

The main character should have a big goal (I,e winning a war, becoming rich or powerful, becoming a monarch etc) and ideals.

I would prefer no romance and a plot driven story.

But if there is romance, then I would prefer if the love interest is not domineering and has a lovable personality in a way that complements our MC. Would prefer if the love interest has a moral compass and a good person. I want that golden retriever energy. Would prefer if the romance is a small part of the overall story. 

I have read a few books where the powerful protagonist becomes a damsel in distress when the love interest appears and I HATE that.

Would prefer if the main character faces adversity. 

Would prefer if the main character is smart and cunning and capable of solving their problems.

No slice of life. No, wanting to open a coffee shop is not a big goal.

\~\~\~\~\~

  
2.17.

Major Mary Phillips slumped in her chair in the conference room. She was exhausted. A cup of coffee rested in her hand, the eighth since she‚Äôd awoken that day. She was getting an average of four hours a sleep per night since the Yonohoans had arrived, and she had lost track of the last time she‚Äôd had a real meal. She‚Äôd been subsisting on energy bars and whatever take out her aides delivered while she either spoke directly with the Yonohoans or gave presentations, either repeating the same information endlessly or providing to-the-moment updates on the situation to her superiors and others who were being read into the situation.

She had hoped that with time her responsibilities would lesson, but apparently the Yonohoans kept asking for her specifically in their communications request. They were often directed to her peers, often with her apologies that she was busy and assurances that the other contacts were her equals, but the Yonohoans expressed a willingness to wait until she was available that bordered on sadistic.

Fortunately she wasn‚Äôt giving this presentation. She just needed to be present and remain awake for it.

Eventually the room was filled, and Mary sent a signal to the Yonohoans that everyone was present. Immediately the hologram appeared of former Sergeant Diego Cruz, startling half of the attendees who weren‚Äôt used to the slow integration of the Yonohoan communication devices and practices yet.

‚ÄúHello everyone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn case you don‚Äôt know me, I‚Äôm the NCO who first boarded the Yonohoan flagship and eventually went native. I was discharged from my commission in the field by Captain Moon, but I retain my loyalties to Earth. It‚Äôs the planet where my family lives, and my body will break before I allow it to come to harm.‚Äù

He paused a moment. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a Yonohoan Oath. It‚Äôs a strong one, and the Yonohoan‚Äôs take their oaths very seriously. Especially that one. You are expected to say it about your homeworld. If you ever hear a Yonohoan make this oath about Earth, it means that they are seriously considering immigration and integration with our culture, to the point where they may forsake their previous obligations.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs many of you are aware, I am a sworn brother to the person you believe to be the Yonohoan leader, Eolai. This is a simplification of the actual Yonohoan social structure. Eolai‚Äôs official rank would be more equivalent to a five star general than a head of state. Their civilian government defers to him on any matter which acquires his interest, however. This is not done out of fear but out of respect for the sacrifices he makes for their people.

‚ÄúHe is authorized to make oaths and promises which the government is obligated to uphold for the duration of his lifetime. Which will last for quite a while. He was born almost three hundred years ago, but thanks to the use of stasis technology he is only my age, approximately twenty-eight years old. He will continue to be placed in and out of stasis for the rest of his life until he dies either a natural or violent death. In addition, with the advanced medical capabilities of the Yonohoan society, their average lifespan for their men is approximately one hundred and eighty years *without* the use of stasis.

‚ÄúIn other words, I suggest that you take his negotiations very seriously, because his oaths can continue to impact Yonohoan policy for many of our generations.‚Äù

The hologram paused for a moment, and Mary watched the man take a drink from an invisible glass or bottle of water. He continued.

‚ÄúIt is my opinion that Eolai is an advocate for humanity and Earth, and that attempts should be made to cultivate a relationship with him. Because of the oath that I exchanged with Eolai, he is formally obligated to personally defend Earth and its people for the duration of the lives of my immediate family on Earth. If Eolai engages in battle, you can expect the entirety of the Yonohoan military to respond in his defense.

‚ÄúEolai is also particularly important in the larger galaxy and universe due to his heritage. Many interstellar treaties were negotiated by his father or his father‚Äôs allies. These treaties do not have specified durations or end dates measured in fixed amount of time, but are rather based on the lifespan of individuals and their families. One key phrase in many treaties is ‚Äòuntil the death of the Last Son of Eodar.‚Äô Eolai was selected before birth to be Eodar‚Äôs final son. That means that when he dies, the political landscape of the entire universe will shift.

‚ÄúSo, yeah. He‚Äôs kind of a big deal. Does anyone have any questions at this time regarding Eolai and his role in Yonohoan society?‚Äù

‚ÄúEodar is also the name of the rogue agent who is suspected of infiltrating Earth, is it not?‚Äù one of the generals in the room inquired. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm curious as to the relationship between Eolai and Eodar.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is a complicated subject. In order to explain it, we‚Äôll have to cover a piece of technology that was abused in the past during the Liberation wars. Specifically what many of you have taken to call the ‚ÄòReplicator.‚Äô It is possible, using the replicator, to create a fully functional living human with a lifetime of memories, experiences, and skills taken from an original subject whose ‚Äòimprint‚Äô was acquired. The use of this technology to create living humans has been illegal for thousands of years thanks to the negotiations and treaties for which the Yonohoan war hero Eodar is responsible.

‚ÄúEodar had his imprint harvested repeatedly over the duration of the long war. There are records of thousands of versions of him, taken while he was serving in many different positions. He was an infantry man, a scout, an officer, a researcher, a negotiator, a politician, a diplomat, and ultimately a peacemaker. It is presently unknown which version was printed out and sent to Earth.

‚ÄúAccording to Yonohoan tradition, it doesn‚Äôt matter which version of Eodar is on Earth. All that matters is that he is there. Any land upon which Eodar walked is considered historic, and any land where he died is close to sacred,‚Äù Diego explained.

‚ÄúThat said, we believe that this is a young version of Eodar, from before he rose to prominence. He will likely not remember his many grand accomplishments and believe that he is a small cog in the war machine. He self-identified as a forward scout, implying that he is from the early stages of the war. Specifically while the human forces were ramping up and pushing back the old empire. It was common to send children onto a planet in order to integrate into their society to identify threats and abuses that were being done against the human population.‚Äù

Mary frowned and raised her hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, you said children? Eodar is a child?‚Äù

Diego looked at her and frowned. ‚ÄúWas that not previously available information? Yes. *This* Eodar was born tens of thousands of years ago, but he has only lived for twelve years.‚Äù

Diego looked away and then corrected himself. ‚ÄúActually it is more accurate to say that he only believes that he has lived for twelve years. Physically he would resemble an adolescent Yonohoan. However, he might have only been printed out a few months ago. He might even be so young to believe that he is the original Eodar and that little time has passed between his birth and the present. The use of Replication technology on children was reprehensible, but it was used extensively during the Liberation Wars by all sides. Harvesting an imprint is fatal, ladies and gentlemen. It was a common practice when it was deemed necessary not to explain to the poor kids what was happening so that they wouldn‚Äôt be afraid. If he wasn‚Äôt told before they harvested him, he‚Äôs probably very confused about his place in the universe. We don‚Äôt know who printed him or for what purpose. All that I‚Äôm certain of is that it wasn‚Äôt the Yonohoans.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat makes you certain of that?‚Äù one of the men, Mary couldn‚Äôt remember the man‚Äôs rank, inquired.

‚ÄúYonohoans would consider it sacrilege to print an Eodar. His beliefs are based upon ancient Yonohoan traditions which mean that every time he is printed by their replication technology, his soul is pulled from the afterlife and forced to return to a life of torment and the service of humanity. Although there was a lot of sorrow when the last Eodar died, there was also celebration for the fact that his soul was finally free to walk the halls of his ancestors, as he believed was the fate that awaited him,‚Äù Diego explained.

‚ÄúSo you believe that there is another player, as of yet identified, involved in this scandal?‚Äù the man pressed.

‚ÄúYes sir, that is what both I and Eolai believe.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you believe that you should handle Eodar once we find him?‚Äù someone else inquired.

‚ÄúThat is not my decision to make, Ma‚Äôam. I would recommend caution. He defeated Eolai, who is a trained combatant enhanced by Yonohoan military technology, as well as slaughtering an entire ship filled with Topokans. He‚Äôs dangerous. That is without getting into the politics of the situation,‚Äù Diego explained.

‚ÄúHow do you recommend that we proceed, sergeant?‚Äù Mary asked.

‚ÄúWith extreme caution, Ma‚Äôam. I realize that you‚Äôre not going to stop searching for Eodar. I believe that it would be best, once he‚Äôs located, to observe from a distance before making contact. I know I said that he‚Äôs a kid, but I would not recommend underestimating him because of his age.‚Äù

There was a lapse of silence, then another question was asked regarding the nature of the interstellar treaties and how that impacted Earth.

‚ÄúWe are not a signatory to any interstellar treaty,‚Äù someone objected. ‚ÄúHow does that effect us?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn this galaxy, as is common throughout the universe at large, Earth is considered to be what is called a human Darkworld. The official definition of a Darkworld is a world inhabited by humans which due to choice or historical events has disconnected from the larger information nets that are utilized by Brightworlds. There are specific provisions and laws regarding our treatment. Now that we‚Äôre reaching out to the stars, the expectation will be that we integrate into one of the three major empires of the Milky Way.

‚ÄúWe can attempt to maintain our independence, but we‚Äôll be a very small fish in a very large pond. Right now everyone is clamoring to know more about us. They want to learn about our history and culture. That will eventually change as we become more familiar and people lose interest.

‚ÄúOur relationship with the Yonohoans *should* give us a significant advantage. They‚Äôre not as large as the empires of this galaxy, but their culture is largely independent and autonomous. I *strongly* recommend attempting to reach a mutual defense pact with them, ladies and gentlemen. They might be a relatively small society, but if someone declares war on them or one of their allies, half of the universe is required by treaty to go to war in their defense.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the main reasons why the universe is at peace.‚Äù

The discussion continued for some time. During the first break, Mary slipped into the back of the room, forgoing the use of the bathroom despite the growing need, and made a call to one of her subordinates to expand the search for the rogue agent.",0,1730017280.0,HFY,2,0.5,False

I‚Äôm not gonna get into what we or my wife have going on but what I will say is am I wrong for no longer wanting to be apart of this church when my old pastor was told that I am constantly getting up to use the bathroom or get coffee which isn‚Äôt true. It‚Äôs weird and it rubbed me the wrong way and maybe this is a wild assumption but I think it‚Äôs logical to think that the pastor of one church probably reached out to this pastor of our current one to try and council us. Old pastor says he never saw me act like that during service and at his church and at that time I still wasn‚Äôt sure I believed in God. 
I took it LESS seriously then. I‚Äôm sorry but this is just extremely weird and off putting and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve grown in my faith enough to know that while people disappoint God does not.

I look up from my work for a moment to catch a short relief back into the real world and I make eye contact with you,

You're beautiful, Are you an art or fashion student? Your outfit is phenomenal.

This is the most real interpretation of Cupid's arrow I could ever imagine, we both blush and look away. I continue my work for some reason and you put on your headphones, giving me the world's worst excuse to not say anything to you.

I eventually leave to go to my next class,

I'm too afraid to say anything.

As I leave I look at the painting of the forest burning for more than a few moments, as I think about my future, and decide to turn around and see if I could even walk up to you, but as I turn the corner back to the central area, your friend has already come to study with you, further discouraging me from going up to you.

I'm afraid and don't know how to deal with this kind of fear.

I leave.

I see you again, maybe a month later at the coffee shop near the railroad tracks, as I'm studying, I see you again,

you're with the same friend.

I

again,

Fear? Indecision? Some amalgamation of my past forming up to now?

Probably.

I don't know

I think that's my problem.

Is my memory a curse? Or is this something else.

1gd676q,https://i.redd.it/ym4xx9tcc9xd1.jpeg,Character of the week! ,"‚ú®Brewster & The Roost ‚ú®

Who is Brewster? 

Brewster is an NPC, he‚Äôs a blue rock dove, otherwise known as a pigeon, and he's identified by his distinct look: small round glasses, black mustache, and butler-esque style. He also has the voice of a grumpy villager. Brewster may be a bit stand-offish at first, but he's very friendly once you get to know him. Plus, he's always around to serve up piping hot beverages for your villager and everyone else on your island. üèùÔ∏è‚òïÔ∏è

How to find Brewster: 

You need to have at least a 3 star rating on your island! You also need the art wing added to your museum and you MUST have donated at LEAST one of each of the following: 

* Sea creature 
* Fish
* Fossil 
* Bug 
* A work of art 

Once you‚Äôve done this the next time you speak to Blathers at the museum he will be waiting with a thought bubble above his head. üí≠ Then Blathers will bring up his long time friend and ask you to look for him, he‚Äôll give you Brewsters photograph and tell you about his love for gyroids! After this you can head to the dock and speak to Kapp‚Äôn, pay the 1,000 book miles for a boat tour and head out! Once you arrive at the island explore and find Brewster and talk to him. When you‚Äôve arrived back at your island speak to Blathers again and he‚Äôll tell you that the museum will be closed the following day for renovations. ü•∞

What to do in The Roost: 

Now that you've got your coffee shop, what can you do? Well, The Roost is open 24/7 for your coffee needs. ‚òïÔ∏è You can stop by and use 200 bells on a delightful beverage. You can people watch as your favorite NPCs cycle in and out of the cafe, and you can even call characters to the coffee shop provided you have the amiibo using the amiibo Call Center!! You can also invite your friends, and the whole gang can enjoy a coffee together ü•∞ If you do invite a group, make sure you're not the last to sit. üòâ The final person has the option of paying for the group, splitting the bill, or getting an invoice. Sadly, if you don't have the money, some of your friends will be drinking water. üò¨ üòÇ That's not all!! As you purchase coffee daily and drink it hot as ""intended,"" Brewster will give you the option of taking coffee to-go. You can also eventually add pigeon milk if you really want to. Coffee to-go costs a bit more, though, at 300 bells a cup. Eventually, he'll even give you a few recipes, like one for cookies shaped like our favorite winged barista. ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è",2,1730016864.0,DodoCodeCommunity,1,1.0,False
