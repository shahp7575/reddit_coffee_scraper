1ld6aw2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ld6aw2,Products and routine for thin density / fine hair,"Would love some help!! I have been trying to figure out how to better care for my hair as I grow it out.   
  
Here are some snapshots of my journey so far. These are all p much examples of day 2 hair with different products with the first being my current routine.  
  
Routine currently: Wash with Maui moisture lightweight curls, condition w/ Eva NYC frizz free smoothing conditioner, wash out and scrunch in kinky curly knot today. Use a hair towel to squeeze out excess moisture, spray in and scrunch curlsmith effortless waves, let air dry for the duration of breakfast + iced coffee, then diffuse on low heat. Fluff it with a pump of verb ghost oil on my palms to tame the frizz. I sometimes sub head and shoulders in, I also apply liquid minoxidil twice daily ✌️  
  
My hair is very thin and super lightweight. It also dries out super super quickly. I’d love some recommendations for more lightweight products as overload has been a problem for me- I’ve tried the Cantù wave whip curling mousse, Aussie flash freeze gel, not your mothers curl cream and volumizing mousse. I liked the cantu product most the rest felt too heavy for my hair. The curlsmith product feels really nice and light for my hair but I’d love to get more definition and hold, the spray really doesn’t keep my hair from exploding into a ball of frizz on a hot day.

1ld67gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeetablebooks/comments/1ld67gf/would_you_be_into_a_wine_pairing_coffee_table_book/,Would you be into a wine pairing coffee table book?,"Hey everyone! I’m doing some early research and would love your thoughts.

I’m working with a sommelier who shares original recipes and wine pairings (mostly natural, organic, or small-batch wines) on her Instagram. It's still new but growing. She wants to create a wine pairing book that matches her recipes with curated wines, which can be ordered online for readers to try.

We’re torn between two directions:

1. **A coffee table-style book** – beautiful photography, full-page images of the recipes, featured vineyards, and interesting wine facts. More aesthetic, something you’d leave out for guests to flip through.
2. **A more classic wine pairing cookbook** – still includes all the same recipes and wines, but focuses more on written content: wine region info, winemaking details, pairing principles, etc.

Both versions would have the same core recipes and wine pairings, just different in format, tone, and depth.

Do either of these ideas appeal to you? Would you use a wine pairing book? Would you be more likely to buy *or* gift something decor-focused and visual, or more text-heavy and informative?

I'm open to and welcoming of any feedback. We’re still very early in the process and just want to learn what would appeal to people. Thank you, everyone!!

1ld66j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/electriccars/comments/1ld66j2/why_electric_cars_are_more_than_just_a_trend/,Why Electric Cars Are More Than Just a Trend,"Electric cars have made traveling so much easier. They are silent and are paving the way to new means of mobility all throughout the world.

Limited Maintenance Costs

A car powered on electricity has fewer parts that are subject to wear and tear than a traditional car. Result? You will hardly ever have to make repairs, saving you tons of money in the long run. No servicing, no need to go to the garage to fix an issue, and braking less harshly result in the electric car making the best deal for the average man.

Quieter Towns & Roads

No sound! The electric vehicle… we won’t hear it coming. And probably won’t be as exposed to the noise pollution it is freeing us from. Having quieter cities will improve your quality of life and the quality of life of the wildlife. It will also prevent you from getting sick. Did you know that noise pollution has resulted in hospitals being busier because it has been directly linked with diseases such as obesity, heart attacks, and headaches?

At Home I Can Charge. How Practical!

No need to leave your house to go fill up your car every other week! The electric car can be recharged in your own garage. An adapter in the wall it only needs down time overnight to be good to go by morning. If you refuse to settle for any less than your favorite espresso coffee, your best start of the day or you can do without the danger of fainting when collided with a stranger driving towards you, bear in mind that convenience starts at home.

Conclusion

An electric car not only provides clean energy but gives you also more peace, and more money.

1ld66fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ld66fe/my_flower_pot_always_had_8_flowers_now_it_has_10/,My Flower Pot Always Had 8 Flowers. Now It Has 10.,"
I’ve always liked even numbers. Eights, specifically. I live alone, I walk eight blocks to work, I eat eight almonds a day, and I have a flower pot on my windowsill that I take pride in keeping exactly the way I like it: clean terracotta, soil changed every 60 days, and eight little red tulips standing tall like soldiers. I’ve had that pot for years. I bought it with my grandmother the summer before she passed. It’s one of the only things that feels right, settled, not shifting with the rest of this frantic city. Every morning, I water the flowers at 6:30 a.m. sharp, one second after my alarm and one minute before my coffee starts to boil. Every time, there are eight. Exactly eight. Until yesterday morning.

When I stepped out onto the balcony yesterday, groggy but calm, with my watering can in hand, I noticed something that brought me to a stop so sudden I sloshed water on my slippers. Ten. There were ten tulips. The pot hadn’t changed. The soil hadn’t shifted. But now, among the neat, disciplined row of red tulips, there were two more—one pale yellow, one nearly black, tucked in the middle like they had always belonged. I stared for a while, trying to make sense of it. Was I half-asleep? Did I buy more bulbs and forget? Did someone break in and add them like some kind of floral prank? My door was locked. My window had a latch. My balcony doesn’t connect to any other units. I live on the 17th floor. Nobody could’ve climbed up there, let alone plant something that precisely. I brushed it off. Maybe the bulbs were always there and just bloomed later than the others. Maybe I miscounted. I told myself that for the rest of the day.

That night, I dreamed of gardens—wide, open ones filled with rows and rows of tulips that stretched farther than the sky. But the tulips weren’t still. They moved, turning slowly to face me, their petals opening like mouths. They whispered things I couldn’t quite hear, in a voice that sounded like wind dragged through teeth. When I woke up, my clock blinked 8:08. My room was cold. Colder than it should’ve been in July. My windows were shut, yet there was a faint scent in the air—sweet, earthy, and wet. Like soil that had just been turned. I walked to the kitchen to start my routine again. I poured the water. I walked to the balcony. I looked down. Ten flowers. Still ten. But now, the yellow one was pointing toward me. Bent unnaturally, like someone had twisted its neck. And its petals looked... sharper. Not jagged, not torn—sharp, like they had grown tiny thorns along their edges. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t water them.

All day, I felt off. My coworker said I looked pale. My phone kept flickering—black screen for a second, then fine. I got two calls from “Unknown,” both of which had no sound on the other end except a low, buzzing hum. I tried to tell myself I was just tired. Paranoia, maybe. My grandmother had moments like that before she passed. She talked about strange flowers showing up in her garden, ones she didn’t remember planting. My mom said she had early dementia. But I remember Gran whispering to me when I was young, telling me never to plant more than eight. “Eight holds the shape,” she said once. “Eight keeps the roots where they belong.” I always thought she meant gardening metaphorically. Now I’m not so sure.

Today, the yellow flower has grown. It’s almost twice the size of the others. Its stem is thick and dark, more like a vine than a tulip. The black one, too, has changed—its petals have curled inward, like a closed fist, and there's a faint, red sheen around its base that wasn’t there before. I didn’t sleep last night. The dream came again, but this time I was standing in my apartment, and the tulips were inside, all ten of them, sprouting from the floor, cracking through the hardwood, wrapping around my ankles. I woke up gasping, convinced I felt something touch my foot. My bedsheets had dirt on them. Just a little. Just enough. I checked the pot first thing. There are still ten flowers—but now the red ones look wilted. The original eight are bending, curling, shriveling, as if the new two are leeching life from them. I feel like something is growing out of place. Not just the flowers. In me.

The light in my hallway started flickering tonight. The mirror in the bathroom showed something behind me—just for a second. A shape. Tall. Thin. Petals for fingers. I turned so fast I knocked over the soap dispenser. Nothing was there. I locked every door. Turned off every light. But from the balcony, I hear rustling. Nothing should be rustling 17 floors up. I don’t want to go out there, but I will. I have to. Something is telling me the pot needs attention. Not like a voice. Not exactly. It’s like a pressure behind my eyes, pushing forward every time I try to ignore it. When I close my eyes, I see the tenth flower. It pulses. It breathes. It watches.

It’s 3:08 a.m. now. I gave in. I opened the sliding door. The air was thick. Humid. Wrong. I stepped out. The pot was there, as always—but it had cracked. Hairline fractures down the sides, leaking a slow, black ooze that smelled like rot and cinnamon. The yellow flower moved as I approached, bending toward me, reaching. I swear it grew as I stood there. The black one split open down the middle and released a puff of pollen or spores or… something. I couldn’t breathe for a second. I stumbled back. My vision went dark around the edges. And when I looked again, the original eight were gone. Just gone. Not wilted. Not picked. Gone. Only the yellow and black remained.

I’m sitting inside now. I’ve locked the door. I pulled the curtain over the window, but the shadow of the flowers still stretches across the floor. I don’t know if it’s the city lights or something else, but it’s getting longer. Thicker. And it’s not still anymore. It moves slightly when I blink. I’ve stopped checking the time. I don’t want to know what hour it is. I don’t want to see another 8. I can hear them now. Not voices—roots. Crawling. Burrowing. Not just through the soil anymore. Through walls. Through me. There’s dirt under my fingernails I don’t remember touching. My skin smells like leaves. I think something’s blooming inside me. Something that doesn’t belong here.

1ld66dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SeanWil69/comments/1ld66dm/chapter_eight_close_enough_to_lie/,Chapter Eight - Close Enough to Lie,"Sasha woke to the sound of soft rain against the bedroom window, her head nestled on Thomas’s chest. His arm was draped around her like a claim, warm and heavy. She blinked slowly, the early morning light turning the room a soft, silvery gray.

They’d made up the night before.

Not with words — not really. There had been apologies, yes, but not the kind that addressed anything beneath the surface. Just kisses that were too long, too forceful, and a quiet agreement, unspoken, to pretend everything was fine.

This morning, the silence between them wasn’t strained. Just… practiced.

She slid out from under his arm, careful not to wake him, and padded barefoot into the kitchen. Her planner sat open on the counter, pages full of to-do lists scribbled in pencil: lighting check, price tags, artist bios, refreshment order. The exhibit was two days away. The gallery still smelled faintly like sawdust and varnish, and the central piece — her own — wasn’t even mounted yet.

Sasha poured herself a coffee, glancing toward the hallway. Maybe he’d sleep in. Maybe she’d have a few quiet hours to herself.

No such luck.

Thomas appeared in the doorway, shirtless, hair tousled. “You’re up early.”

“I’ve got to get to the gallery,” she said, sipping her coffee. “There’s still a ton to do.”

He walked over and wrapped his arms around her from behind, burying his face in the crook of her neck. “Or,” he murmured, lips brushing her skin, “you could stay. Just for a little bit.”

Sasha smiled, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I really can’t.”

He kissed her shoulder, slow and purposeful. “It’s one morning.”

She tilted her head, letting herself sink into the warmth of him for just a moment. Letting herself pretend this was how things used to feel — easy, exciting, safe.

But her phone buzzed on the counter.

She reached for it.

Two messages. Both from Tyler.

Sent just before midnight.

She scanned the first one:

U were right. Should’ve let u stay. I mean I’m glad u did. That’s not what I meant. Just. Thanks.

Then the second:

Do u think about me when ur not around me? Cuz I think about u. Too much probably.

Sasha’s breath caught. A slow flush crept up her neck, burning her cheeks.

She locked the screen quickly before Thomas could see anything.

“Everything okay?” he asked, still holding her.

“Yeah,” she said, voice a little too bright. “Just gallery stuff.”

He kissed the side of her jaw. “Skip it. You’ll still be a genius artist if you show up late.”

“I really can’t,” she said again, this time with more force. She turned in his arms and kissed his cheek. “I’ll be back by dinner.”

Thomas let her go, reluctantly.

She disappeared into the bedroom to change, her mind already spiraling — not with thoughts of the exhibit, not even of Thomas.

But of a drunken message sent by a boy with soft eyes and a broken knee who made her laugh more than she should’ve let him.

She wouldn’t reply. She knew that.

But as she tucked her phone into her coat pocket, Sasha couldn’t stop herself from rereading the second message one more time.

Too much probably.
Yeah.

1ld6582,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ld6582/little_brother_by_cory_doctorow_is_a_crime/,"""Little Brother"" by Cory Doctorow is a crime against literature","9/11 was a tough time in American history. Thousands of people died in the initial attack, and several more in the immediate area died from smoke inhalation later. Muslims became Public Enemy #1. It began our decades long conflict with the Middle East. However, one of the biggest impacts of 9/11 locally was how the government reacted to it. There have been several new laws put in place to ensure another 9/11 doesn't happen. Some people believe that these laws came at the expense of our freedoms. However, because we were still effected by the attack, forced Patriotism became normalized. This was the time of Freedom Fries. If you didn't support this, you were a tree hugging liberal who wanted the terrorists to win. After all, if you had nothing to hide, what were you scared of?

Why am I talking about 9/11? Well, Little Brother's primary story is a social commentary on the post-9/11 hysteria and the Patriot Act. It was also published in 2008.... The last year of Bush's presidency... A bit late to the party there, Mr. Doctorow. Don't get me wrong, 9/11 was still less than a decade old at this point, but the post-9/11 jingoism had cooled down midway into Bush's second term. At the time, America was more focused on the War in Iraq. The public had already started to see Bush for the dipshit of a president that he was, which was one of the reasons why Obama won later that year. Also, this book has had a film adaptation that's been in development hell for the last decade now. Yeah, I can't imagine why. Though, something tells me that if it does finally get off the ground, they'll update the story to be a social commentary on Trump's immigration policies.

Okay, maybe the subject matter might be dated, but the execution can still work, so why don't we actually talk about the story? We're introduced to our protagonist, Marcus Yallow. He's a hacker from San Francisco... Wait, did Ubisoft rip this premise off for Watch_Dogs 2?... Anyway, he's getting reprimanded by his principal because he's been using his hacking skills to screw around at school, but the principal doesn't have enough evidence to punish him. So, right after his close call with suspension, if not expulsion, Marcus uses his hacking skills to play hooky with his friend Darryl. First, he microwaves a tracking chip in Darryl's library book, no doubt causing hundreds, if not thousands, in damages instead of, oh, I don't know, putting the fucking book in his locker. Then, when he sees a classmate he doesn't like in the hallway, he's afraid he's going to get tattled on. Fortunately, that classmate has a cheap ad controlled phone, so he distracts him by clogging his inbox with spam. We're supposed to find it amusing that this kid's parents can't afford the latest iPhone and that Marcus ruined his phone. Our hero, ladies and gentlemen!

So, why is Marcus playing hooky? Well, he wants to win a trip to Japan by playing an ARG. That's an Alternate Reality Game. It's an online game that require visiting real world locations to get clues... Oh, you already know what an ARG is, and if you don't, you can just use Google to find that out? Yeah, well, get used to that. Doctorow... er, I mean, ""Marcus,"" tends to go on long spiels about underground geek culture in this book that add very little to the story. Sometimes, the things he drones on about are poorly researched. At one point, he namedrops Astro Boy, and then mansplains to the audience that his Japanese name is ""Atom Boy."" No, it's not. His Japanese name is ""Tetsuwan Atom,"" which translates to ""Mighty Atom,"" or ""Iron-Armed Atom."" Yeah, he got half of it right, but it's still distracting. That's like saying Mega Man's Japanese name is ""Mega Rock."" My knowledge on Astro Boy came from the 2009 movie and even I knew that.

So, Marcus and Darryl meet with their other friends, Jolu and Van. However, while they're playing, suddenly, the Bay Bridge gets blown up by terrorists. In the confusion, Darryl gets stabbed for some reason. Then, immediately after, Marcus and his friends get arrested by the Department of Homeland Security... Why? What did they do that made them look suspicious to be arrested on the spot? As far as we know, Marcus wasn't reported for playing hooky, and I seriously doubt microwaving a library book is grounds for government intervention. Marcus is white as Christmas, so he wasn't profiled for being a Muslim. Maybe if this had happened a few days later, I could buy this. Maybe Marcus's principal found out he played hooky right before the terrorist attack and used his suspicions of his hacking as further evidence that he might be the culprit.

So, during Marcus's detainment, we are introduced to this book's villain, the Severe Haircut Woman... Yes, that's what Marcus calls her for most of the book before he learns her real name. Not ""the agent,"" or ""the interrogator."" Nah, instead he addresses her as something that sounds like a derogatory term for lesbians, and not a very effective one either. That'd be like if Darth Vader were called ""Tall Crippled Asthmatic,"" or if Voldemort were called ""Noseless Bald Guy."" Anyway, she does everything in her power to make Marcus feel abused, like... asking him politely to unlock his phone. Not only that, but Marcus doesn't have anything incriminating on it. Not even porn. So, all Marcus has to do is hand over his phone and he can go home, right?... Right? Nah, Marcus stubbornly refuses because he doesn't want his privacy violated. No, they're not violating his privacy. They are asking him to unlock his phone, but he isn't complying. So, naturally, Marcus is kept in detainment until he actually cooperates. They don't torture him. They don't hack his phone themselves. They wait until he gives in.

So, DHS eventually lets him go, but they warn him that they're keeping an eye on him. Considering he is a known hacker at his school, used his hacking skills to play hooky, and was completely uncooperative during his interrogation, can you really blame DHS for suspecting him? When Marcus gets released, San Francisco now has security cameras on every street corner and he can't even buy some coffee without jumping through some hoops. When Marcus complains about this to his father, he's completely on the DHS's side, especially since for three days, he was worried out of his fucking mind that Marcus might have been killed in the attack and Severe Haircut Woman forbade him from saying anything to his parents. Instead of seeing things from his point of view, he believes his father is being ignorant. It doesn't help that during their arguments, Marcus says shit that would have gotten him a smack across the face if his dad was Catholic, like ""So the police should suck harder than my spam folder?"" By the way, the dialogue in this book is fucking awful. At one point, Marcus announces that he has a boner that could cut glass. To get back on topic, everybody who supports DHS are either jerks or ignorant. There's no nuance in this argument.

The straw that breaks the camel's back for Marcus is when he learns the DHS is spying on him. Does he find out by using his 1337 hacking skills? No. He notices his laptop isn't charging properly and he takes it apart to see a bug obstructing the charging port... You'd think the government wouldn't have made such a rookie mistake. Despite the DHS's ineptitude, Marcus has had all he could stands and he can't stands no more, so he declares war on the DHS. No, he doesn't use his hacking skills to find the terrorists responsible for the attack to not only clear his name, but also prove DHS wrong. That would have actually been an interesting story, wouldn't it? But no, his privacy has been violated for reasons that totally aren't his own fucking fault, and that's clearly the bigger tragedy than the thousands of people that were killed in the terrorist attack. This was around the point where I yelled ""oh my god, fuck Marcus!"" He's a whiny, self-absorbed brat who brings most of his problems upon himself. He doesn't give a shit about the terrorist attack or how it effected his loved ones. At worst, he gets annoyed by people talking about it all the time in the media, even on sex-talk radio. All he cares about is getting inconvenienced by some security measures.

So, to make a point against his dad, Marcus's first act against DHS is to have he and his hacking buddies build aphrid cloners to steal data and disrupt the checkpoints. This causes the city to be put to a standstill, and people getting wrongfully questioned by the DHS, including Marcus's father. He even takes delight in knowing that if it goes on for a week, it would cause more economic damage than the terrorist attack. Our hero, ladies and gentlemen! Of course, this ends up backfiring, as this only causes DHS to beef up security. Who could have seen this coming besides somebody with an IQ higher than their shoe size?

This was around the point where I started to lose interest in the story. I did everything I could to keep going. At some point in the book, Marcus meets a girl named Ange. Her character basically begins and ends with ""Love Interest,"" but the narrative tries to make her quirky. One of her particular quirks is that she uses pepper spray as a condiment. Here's a little PSA for everybody reading: DON'T DO THAT! Pepper spray may sound delicious, but ingesting it is not a good idea! It can cause throat irritation, vomiting, and swelling of the airways! In other words, you can potentially DIE! ""Well, it has 'Pepper' in the name, so it should be edible, right?"" Yeah, and mustard gas has ""mustard"" in it, but you still shouldn't put that shit on your hot dogs! Did Google just not exist in the UK in 2008, Mr. Doctorow? Were you not the least bit concerned that somebody reading might be dumb enough to try that!?

Fuck it. I'm just going to skip to the end. So, eventually Marcus learns that his friend, Darryl, is still alive. Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that Marcus thought he was dead since he disappeared after the attack. It turns out the DHS has kept him detained.

Producer Guy: ""So, why did the DHS imprison somebody who was bleeding to death when they found him, but not the uncooperative suspect that they believe is a terrorist?""

Writer Guy: ""Hey, shut up!""

Eventually, Marcus's cyberterrorism catches up to him, and Severe Haircut Woman arrests him again. Now, you might be thinking that even if she's a bit extreme about it, Severe Haircut Woman is just doing her job to protect the country. However, if you recall earlier, I said there was no nuance in the argument. Everybody in the DHS is a one-dimensional strawman, and to negate any good point she might have, Severe Haircut Woman is a power-tripping sociopath. To demonstrate this, she waterboards a fucking minor for shits and giggles. I bet that for such an occasion, she has a fake mustache that she puts on so that she could twirl it. That's our villain! She does what she does because she's evil! She puts SF under heavy security because she's evil! She spies on Marcus because she's evil! Christ on a stick, this book is terrible!

Final conclusion, if you want a good story about hacking with intentionally flawed heroes and three dimensional villains, just watch mr. robot.

1ld63e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioLandlord/comments/1ld63e6/who_pays_for_this_electrician/,Who pays for this electrician?,"Hello.

We lived in a house for 14 years and never had any issue with power ever.

Tenant moves on and blew the kitchen power once, we paid full cost to fix it as we didnt know. We suspected it was their air fryer causing this problem.

Next year (today) they blew the power again. Coffee machine and air fryer plugged in kitchen and blew the circuits again. Resetting fuse box does nothing.

So we need to call an electrician. Who has to pay for it? It is likely that this is caused by tenants appliances and how they use them.

Ive tried looking online and even consulting with chatGPT,  but not entirely sure, I get mixed results. If its the circuit itself for some reason, maybe age, it's on us, but if its not, is it on them?

What about if we were to split on it? Is that seen as an option as well in times like this when its uncertain?

Do we get electrician to come in and figure out the cause AND THEN figure out who has to pay?

I’m working with a sommelier who shares original recipes and wine pairings (mostly natural, organic, or small-batch wines) on her Instagram. It's still new but growing. She wants to create a wine pairing book that matches her recipes with curated wines, which can be ordered online for readers to try.

We’re torn between two directions:

1. **A coffee table-style book** – beautiful photography, full-page images of the recipes, featured vineyards, and interesting wine facts. More aesthetic, something you’d leave out for guests to flip through.
2. **A more classic wine pairing cookbook** – still includes all the same recipes and wines, but focuses more on written content: wine region info, winemaking details, pairing principles, etc.

Both versions would have the same core recipes and wine pairings, just different in format, tone, and depth.

Do either of these ideas appeal to you? Would you use a wine pairing book? Would you be more likely to buy *or* gift something decor-focused and visual, or more text-heavy and informative?

I'm open to and welcoming of any feedback. We’re still very early in the process and just want to learn what would appeal to people. Thank you, everyone!!

There’s a certain magic in the phrase “World Cruise.” It evokes images of golden age travel, of steamer trunks and exotic ports of call, of watching the continents drift by from the comfort of a private veranda. For years, my greatest passion has been helping travelers like you turn those once in a lifetime dreams into detailed, tangible realities. Today, I want to talk about the grandest reality of them all: the World Cruise.

And when it comes to circumnavigating the globe in true six star style, one name stands as the undisputed benchmark for excellence: Crystal Cruises. After a highly anticipated return to the seas, Crystal is not just back; it has been reborn, setting a new standard for what luxury travel can and should be. The ultimate expression of this renaissance is their 2026 World Cruise aboard the magnificent Crystal Serenity, a 135 night odyssey that promises not just to show you the world, but to change the way you see it forever.

The Crystal Difference: What Sets the World's Best Apart

Before we embark on a virtual tour of this incredible itinerary, it’s important to understand what makes Crystal so unique. It’s a combination of intuitive service, exceptional space, and a culinary philosophy that has earned it a legion of intensely loyal fans, many of whom have sailed dozens of times.

The ""Crystal is Back"" Narrative: More Than a Comeback, It's a Renaissance

When the world leading luxury travel company A&K Travel Group acquired Crystal Cruises in 2022, it wasn't just a rescue mission; it was a strategic elevation of an already legendary brand. The ships, Crystal Serenity and Crystal Symphony, underwent a multimillion dollar refurbishment that was less a facelift and more a complete reimagining of the onboard experience.

One of the most telling decisions made during this process was to reduce the number of guests. The Crystal Serenity now welcomes a maximum of 740 passengers, down from its previous capacity. This might seem like a counterintuitive business move, but it was a deliberate choice to enhance the core of the Crystal promise: unparalleled space and exclusivity. This reduction gives Crystal Serenity one of the highest guest to space ratios in the entire cruise industry, at an incredible 93.1 cubic feet per guest. On a practical level, this means no crowds, no queues, and a palpable sense of peace and privacy throughout the ship, from the sun drenched Seahorse Pool deck to the elegant lounges.

Furthermore, the acquisition created a powerful synergy. Abercrombie & Kent, one of the world's most respected names in luxury land tours and safaris, is now a sister company to Crystal. This transforms the approach to shore excursions. What was once a partnership is now a seamless, in-house collaboration, allowing for the creation of meticulously designed, exclusive land experiences that are a consistent and integrated part of the Crystal journey, a level of quality control that is nearly impossible for competitors to replicate. The new Crystal isn't just a cruise; it's a holistic, ultra luxury travel ecosystem.

Service That Feels Like Family

If the ship is the body of Crystal, the crew is its soul. This is what returning guests speak of with the most passion and reverence. With nearly one crew member for every guest, the level of personal attention is astonishing. But it’s the quality of that attention that truly defines the experience. This isn't the stiff, formal service of old world luxury; it's warm, genuine, and remarkably intuitive. Past guests often share stories of how their butler knew their favorite afternoon drink without asking, or how a dining room server remembered a small detail from a conversation days earlier.

This culture is possible because of the crew's deep seated loyalty to the brand. After the relaunch, an incredible 85% of the original crew returned. This speaks volumes. It means the team possesses a wealth of institutional knowledge and a genuine passion that can't be taught in a training manual. They are empowered to think and react, to solve problems creatively, and to make each guest feel truly seen and cared for. This is why so many passengers refer to the crew as family and why the ship feels like a second home.

A cornerstone of this service philosophy is that every single suite and guest room, regardless of category, is attended by a personal butler. This is not a perk reserved for the highest paying guests; it is the standard of care for everyone. Your butler can handle everything from unpacking your luggage and making specialty dining reservations to serving a course by course dinner on your private veranda. It is this unwavering commitment to personal comfort that makes the service feel less like it's merely attentive and more like it's truly intuitive.

A Culinary World Tour Onboard

On a Crystal cruise, every meal is an event. The culinary program is a journey in itself, with nine distinct dining venues on Crystal Serenity, each offering a different atmosphere and gastronomic focus. The chefs are recruited from the world's best restaurants, and they provision the ship with the freshest local ingredients at ports along the way, ensuring the menus are always vibrant and authentic.

The headliners of this culinary show are, without a doubt, the specialty restaurants. Crystal is home to the only restaurant at sea by legendary Master Chef Nobuyuki (Nobu) Matsuhisa, the sublime Japanese Peruvian Umi Uma. Here, you can indulge in his signature dishes like Black Cod with Miso, a dish that has inspired chefs worldwide. Joining it is Beefbar, the first ever ocean outpost of the global street food sensation, offering a modern and exciting take on the world's best cuts of meat. And for lovers of classic European cuisine, Osteria d'Ovidio presents exquisite Italian fare developed in collaboration with the Michelin rated Alajmo brothers.

For guests embarking on the full 2026 World Cruise, the experience is elevated even further. Dining at these world class specialty restaurants is not a once per voyage treat; it is unlimited and complimentary. This is a remarkable inclusion, allowing you to explore these incredible venues as often as you wish over the 135 night journey. This, combined with the elegant main dining room, Waterside, which features a modern, flexible open seating policy, demonstrates how Crystal has evolved to meet the desires of the contemporary luxury traveler.

The Main Event: A Deep Dive into the 2026 World Cruise

With an understanding of the exceptional platform Crystal provides, let's turn to the voyage itself. The 2026 World Cruise is an epic, thoughtfully crafted itinerary designed for deep immersion, not just a whirlwind tour.

**The 2026 World Cruise At a Glance**

* **Voyage Name:** A World Class World Cruise

* **Duration:** 135 Nights
* **Departure Date:** January 11, 2026
* **Departure Port:** Los Angeles, California

The Grand Itinerary: A Four Act Global Drama

I like to think of this journey not as a list of ports, but as a grand play in four acts, each with its own distinct character and flavor.

Act I: South Pacific Dreams (January-February)

The curtain rises in glittering Los Angeles as you sail west into the endless blue of the Pacific. The first act is a symphony of tropical splendor. You'll explore the volcanic peaks and turquoise lagoons of French Polynesia, with calls in legendary isles like Bora Bora, Moorea, and an overnight stay in Papeete, Tahiti, allowing time to witness enchanting traditional dances. The voyage continues to the remote and beautiful Cook Islands before charting a course for the vibrant cultures of the South Pacific, including Tonga, Fiji, and the pristine shores of Vanuatu and New Caledonia.

Act II: Down Under & The Rise of Asia (February-March)

The scenery shifts dramatically as you arrive in New Zealand, exploring the stunning Bay of Islands and the cosmopolitan hub of Auckland. Then, it's on to Australia for an exploration of its iconic cities, including Melbourne and Sydney, and the natural wonders of the Great Barrier Reef region with stops in Cairns and Airlie Beach. From there, the ship turns north, weaving through the lush, emerald islands of Indonesia, where you can witness the famed Komodo dragons and immerse yourself in the spiritual beauty of Bali during an overnight stay. The act concludes with visits to the spectacular beaches of the Philippines, including Boracay and an overnight stay in the bustling capital of Manila.

Act III: The Heart of the East (March-April)

This act is an extended, deep immersion into the captivating cultures of Asia. You'll enjoy overnights in some of the continent's most dynamic cities: the dazzling vertical landscape of Hong Kong, the vibrant street food scene of Ho Chi Minh City, and the temple studded metropolis of Bangkok (Laem Chabang). The journey continues to the futuristic city state of Singapore for another overnight stay, followed by explorations of Kuala Lumpur and Phuket. Finally, you'll sail across the Bay of Bengal to discover the rich history of Sri Lanka and India, with calls in Chennai, Colombo, and an overnight stay in the magnificent city of Mumbai, where you can view the Gateway of India from the sea.

Act IV: Ancient Lands to an Imperial Finale (April-May)

The final act is a breathtaking journey through time. You'll cross the Arabian Sea to the modern marvels of the United Arab Emirates, with stops in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and the ancient frankincense trails of Oman. The voyage then takes you to the historical heart of civilization, with opportunities to visit the wonders of Petra from Aqaba, Jordan, and the temples of Luxor from Safaga, Egypt. After a memorable transit of the Suez Canal, you'll emerge into the classical beauty of the Mediterranean. The grand finale includes calls in Greece and Italy, before a final overnight in the glamorous French Riviera port of Beaulieu-Sur-Mer, perfectly timed for the Monaco Grand Prix, before your epic journey concludes in the eternal city of Rome.

Life Aboard the Journey: Beyond the Destination

On a voyage of this length, the days at sea are just as important as the days in port. Crystal ensures these days are filled with opportunities for growth, learning, and relaxation. The Crystal Visions Enrichment Program brings a roster of world renowned guest speakers onboard, from diplomats and scientists to historians and even astronauts, to share their unique insights on world affairs and culture.

For those who prefer a more hands on approach, the Creative Learning Institute offers a variety of engaging classes in partnership with respected institutions. You can learn a new language with Berlitz, take piano lessons with Yamaha, or deepen your appreciation for wine with the Society of Wine Educators. The Computer University@Sea offers classes to sharpen your digital skills, from photo editing to social media, ensuring you can perfectly capture and share your memories. And as mentioned, the shore excursions curated by Abercrombie & Kent provide a level of access that is simply extraordinary, offering experiences like after hours museum tours and private dinners in UNESCO World Heritage sites. Evenings are just as vibrant, with Broadway caliber production shows, live music, and elegant social gatherings like the beloved ""White Party"" under the stars.

The Unrivaled Perks of a World Cruiser

Booking the full 135 night World Cruise unlocks a suite of exclusive benefits designed to make your journey seamless and utterly stress free. This package of perks is so comprehensive that it effectively creates a “frictionless” travel bubble, addressing all the major and minor logistical pain points of a long duration international trip so you can focus purely on the experience.

The benefits package is a testament to Crystal's deep understanding of the luxury traveler. It anticipates needs you might not have even considered. The Luggage Valet service, for instance, allows you to ship your suitcases from your home directly to the ship and back again, eliminating the hassle of handling multiple bags at the airport. The Private Transfers to and from the airport and ship ensure your journey begins and ends in comfort and privacy. The generous Business Class Airfare Allowance acknowledges that a trip of this magnitude deserves a comfortable flight experience. Even practicalities like complimentary laundry service and an initial onboard medical visit are included to remove small, lingering worries. It’s a clear statement of care, designed to let you immerse yourself completely in the joy of the voyage.

**Your Exclusive 2026 World Cruise Benefits**

* **Business Class Airfare Allowance or Credit:** A generous allowance (e.g., up to $5,000 USD per person) or an air credit for making your own arrangements
* **'As You Wish' Shipboard Credit:** $1,500 per person to spend on board for things like spa treatments, vintage wines, or boutique purchases
* **Private Transfers:** Included to and from the airport and ship. For guests living within 50 miles of Los Angeles, a private car from home to the pier is included
* **Luggage Valet Service:** Complimentary shipping for up to two pieces of luggage per person from your home to the ship and back
* **Unlimited Specialty Dining:** Complementary and unlimited reservations at the exclusive Umi Uma by Nobu and Osteria d'Ovidio
* **Exclusive Shoreside Events:** Specially curated, private events on land, created exclusively for full World Cruise guests
* **Themed Onboard Events & Galas:** A calendar of special parties, gala nights, and celebratory events throughout the voyage
* **Complimentary Laundry & Pressing:** Convenient second day service for laundry and pressing (dry cleaning not included)
* **Complimentary Initial Medical Visit:** Your first visit to the onboard medical center is complimentary (medication and extended treatment are extra)
* **Special Send-Off Celebration:** An exclusive event in Los Angeles to kick off your incredible journey in style

Money Can't Buy Moments

Beyond the tangible benefits lies an even greater perk: a sense of community and exclusivity. The ""Exclusive Shoreside Events"" are not just tours; they are curated experiences that immerse you in the heart of a culture. Imagine attending a private concert in an exquisite palace or dining in a famed museum after it has closed to the public. Onboard, the themed galas and receptions for World Cruisers create a unique camaraderie. You are sharing this incredible journey with a group of like minded, well traveled individuals, forming friendships that can last a lifetime. This entire experience is hosted by Crystal's esteemed World Cruise Ambassador, Fernando Barroso de Oliveira, a veteran of these global voyages who shares his expertise and ensures every moment is exceptional. You are not just a passenger; you are a member of a very exclusive club.

Your Navigator for a Flawless Voyage: The Essential Role of a Travel Consultant

A journey of this scale, with 135 nights and 27 countries, is not a simple booking; it's a major logistical undertaking. This is where the value of a dedicated, expert travel consultant becomes not just a convenience, but an absolute necessity.

Orchestrating the Dream: Why a World Cruise Demands an Expert

The complexity of a World Cruise is immense. There are visa requirements for multiple countries to navigate, each with its own application process and timeline. There are comprehensive travel insurance policies to arrange, ensuring you are covered for any eventuality. There are pre and post cruise hotel stays and flights to coordinate, payment schedules to manage, and dozens of suite categories and locations to choose from on the ship.

The value of a travel consultant scales directly with the complexity and investment of the trip. While booking a simple weekend getaway online might be straightforward, the number of variables and potential points of failure on a World Cruise is exponentially higher. My role is to be your single point of contact and your steadfast advocate. If an issue arises, such as a flight delay or a missing document, you make one phone call to me. You don't have to spend your precious time navigating call centers or dealing with multiple vendors. I handle it all. My expertise allows me to proactively guide you away from pitfalls you might not even know exist, like choosing a beautiful suite that happens to be located under a noisy public deck. For a high stakes, high investment journey like this, my guidance is a crucial part of managing risk and maximizing the value of your vacation.

1ld5y1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1ld5y1p/secrets_of_the_inner_2/,Secrets of the Inner [2],"Doctor Anju is a completely normal and not in any way suspicious-looking and acting Harchen, looking for new and gainful employment in the field of advanced medicine. Except her current place of work isn’t quite as advanced as she thought it would be. Which she can totally decide after five days of working there. Good thing a fateful encounter with a curious Skalgan is about to change her life - for the better, perhaps?

**Memory transcription subject: Victor, Researcher at the Skalga Central Medical Clinic** **Date \[standardized Earth time\]: February 24th, 2152**

The Zurulians had a predator working in their midst.

And I wasn’t talking about any of the humans stumbling around. This one was so out of place it hurt to see. Whyever no one seemed to care was a mystery to me.  
It looked like someone had shrunk an Arxur in the wash… then bleached it. Plus, they’d tacked on a few sheets of scaly rag to their head, in an attempt to simulate a human bob cut.  
Their eyes darted back and forth over their clipboard- speaking of eyes, they were set… oddly. Not quite to the side, not quite to the front, as if they couldn’t decide what place they wanted to be in.

https://preview.redd.it/4lgtn9h90d7f1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=781934f139b2ae4f188f69bbf4c7821c22af6b2a

I had been wanting to check up on a couple of things while I was here - the Zurulians supplied our little institution on Skalga with knowledge and research that our own eggheads lagged behind in, and today it was my turn to negotiate the next exchange. But this- person… had me frozen in the hallway, halfway through a door.

They put the clipboard down and puffed a small breath, then licked their lips, showing teeth entirely too sharp for any prey species, just for a moment. And then, out of the corner of their eye, they noticed me. Of course, I didn’t flinch. That would be showing weakness to this strange individual.

https://preview.redd.it/qu4myhrd1d7f1.jpg?width=657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abf382bdf92d2a33ad8731d76486ffe859e7e668

The edges of their mouth twitched upwards- I had flinched, hadn’t I. My theory that this was a tiny Arxur immediately evaporated, Arxur didn’t smile. They couldn’t.

“Can I help you?”  
The translator fed the meaning into my mind, yet the spoken words were unlike any language I’d heard before.

“Ah- maybe.” I decided to enter the confrontation head on. “Do you know if the chief of medicine is in? I’d need to speak to them.”

“Oh- no, I do not.” \*They- no, she- turned to face me fully, her eyes locking onto me. They were not slitted either… either this was the most predatory Harchen to ever exist, the least threatening Arxur to ever exist, or something else entirely. I decided to press the matter.

“Ah, alright.” I swished my tail. “Say- I like your… scales. Are they natural?”

“Oh! Well,” She gestured with her clipboard. “A genetic oddity. You see, I have a rare case of gigantism, which makes me look a little odd. I am otherwise healthy, you see. No reason to be concerned, at all.”  
She blinked her eyes in a way that could’ve meant, ‘don’t ask any questions.’ I decided to ignore it. She did not look like she had any illness at all. Her spine was too rigid, her proportions too… proportionate. And she wasn’t an albino either, as her eyes gleamed a healthy blue. “You see, it’s- well managed.” She said, as if sensing my doubt.

“Managed,” I prodded, swiveling an ear.

“Yes.” She nodded, which wasn’t a Harchen- Arxur- whatever gesture.

I realized that this line of questioning was a little invasive. “So- Miss,”

“Doctor.” She immediately corrected, “Doctor Anju.”

“*Doctor* Anju.” I flicked an ear. “What is it you do here?”

“Oh! Well, I’ve mostly been responsible for lab work,” She began, making more and more gestures with her clipboard and her filed down claws. “Though I am sure that soon I will be doing research of my own. You see- I specialize in xenobiology. Which is the reason…”

As she rambled, I noticed a little red rivulet run down her snout, originating from her nose. Harchen certainly did not bleed red. That… brought me back to the ‘shrunken Arxur’ theory.  
“Ah, doctor,” I said, signaling with my tail, “you’re bleeding.”

“I am?” She raised a hand and touched it to her nose. It came away red.  
The doctor looked down at it, then back up at me. My ears must’ve given me away, since her eyes narrowed slightly. “It seems so.”  
She dug in her chest pocket and produced a red handkerchief, with which she dabbed her snout clean.

“Say, doctor,” I wondered, stepping closer, “which world do you hail from, if I might ask?”

Her eyes met mine again.  
She knew that I knew, and I knew that she knew that I knew.  
“...Fahl,” She finally said, slowly and with emphasis. Her tongue touched her sharp fangs as she pronounced it. “Why?”

“Just curious.” I shrugged with my tail.

“Well, Sir-”

“Doctor.” I corrected. “Doctor Victor.”

“*Doctor*,” She emphasized, “I wager you have places to be and so do I, I’m a busy woman as you can guess.”

“That is true.” I flicked an ear in reply. “Maybe we’ll have a chance to talk later?”

“I doubt it.” Anju said all too quickly. “There isn’t too much that is interesting about me, no?”  
A tiny smile flashed on her snout, and it vanished equally as quickly. “Fly safe, Doctor.”

“Fly… safe?” I replied, ears lowering in confusion.  
The doctor made her exit, but not without a final, judgemental glance back at me.

He was smart.  
Compared to the Zurulians, that- that Skalgan, was it? He was smart. Perhaps he had found me out because he stood as tall as I did, and had gotten a better look at my face… maybe. In any case, it was annoying. Not quite as annoying as the menial tasks the Zurulians had allocated for me, but still- annoying. I certainly hoped I would never see him again and be done with it. I couldn’t afford to have my cover blown this early, before I made myself essential to them. Before I had a chance to continue my work. It couldn’t possibly end in ruin a second time- that would destroy me.

I stepped into one of the restrooms, quickly regarding my face in the mirror. My left sclera was slightly bloodshot, and another drop of red seemed hellbent on making its way down my nose. I dabbed it away again.  
In hindsight, I should really have called out for today. In double hindsight, a less invasive probe would have done the job equally as well, but now I had to deal with the consequences.

On the one hand, Victor was a risk. On the other hand, maybe I could utilize this. My coworkers, so far, had failed at matching my intellect or lending an ear to my suggestions. I was the new person on the job, despite my three doctorates. Three, might I emphasize!\\

I stared down at my clipboard for a moment, the reaction I was trying to figure out still incomplete. The chat with Victor had caught me so off guard that I had lost track of what I was trying to do.  
With a sigh, I turned and went to follow the odd Skalgan.

“Skalga Central Medical.” I repeated, looking over at Victor before picking up my teacup and taking a sip. I missed coffee. “How do your facilities compare to these, here?”

“Well,” His ears lowered almost imperceptibly. “Smaller. Medicine was always the Zurulians’ thing, while the Federation was still around.. really, the humans brought it to us.”  
There seemed to be a small hint of disdain in his voice. I noted it down for if it ever became relevant.

“I see.”  
I put my cup back down. “You see, I lack the means to do proper biochemistry research here, since everything that is not the most superficial research on the topic is done externally.”

It was ridiculous. They barely had any equipment for things such as genome sequencing or even just slightly advanced chromatography tasks. [It was all handled through an odd service model](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1f7dk83/shared_chemistry_1/) with a name the translator implant did not seem to want to parse, and it was impossible to get published without using it, too. To say I was reluctant to feed my research into a black box service model was an understatement.

“Oh- well, our lab is due to be complete any day now.” Victor said, swishing his tail.

“Really?” My eye ridges raised. “Do you happen to have, ah… an electron microscope?”

“Yup.” Victor’s ears rose slightly. He had me, and he knew he had me. And I knew that he knew, but I did not care.

“A- PCR machine? An electrophoresis machine?” I asked. His ear flicked, which I suppose was a ‘yes’. “C- can you do enzyme kinetics simulations on site?”

“Oh uh… I’d have to check, but we do have some pretty meaty servers in the basement-”

“I’d like to transfer.” I said, my mouth quicker than my cautious mind.

Victor made a noise that signified amusement, I think. “Getting very excited, are we?”

I reined in my expression and straightened my back. “Well- is that a yes, Doctor?”

“It’s a maybe, Doctor.” Victor replied, getting up from his seat. “I think you owe us at least a renewed version of your resume.”  
His tail flicked to the document on the table that I had prudently provided.

My hand tightened into a fist, and I was glad I had filed down my claws. “I think my qualifications speak for me. And I also assumed that we were beyond… prejudice based on a person’s looks.”

Victor’s tail swished again, in a gesture I could not decipher. “Well, Doctor. In that case, I’d be curious to learn more about you in a proper interview, one of these days?”

He wasn’t going to give up, was he.  
“If said interview is conducted in a private setting?”

“It would be.”

“Then- that might be acceptable.”  
Victor flicked his ear, and went to leave with another meaningless-to-me swish of the tail. I watched him go.

I could always omit things. They’d be desperate to hire me, once they knew what I could do for them all. This Victor person would be no exception.

1ld5qpe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ld5qpe,MR X PKMN S1 CHP6: Terrin’s Significant Other!? Op: Silent Giratina…,"(Part 1)

Slide 1: Back at MD’5’s hideout; Tari, Terapagos, Quaxly, and Flabébé have all warped into an UJM cartridge along with Theo and Ogerpon for the former four to see Theo and Ogerpon off as it’s unsafe for him to stay in the real world due to the both of them being unstable. Tari then says to Theo and Ogerpon “Well… I guess you two are back home” to which the latter two reply back with annoyance “I don’t wanna go back…” and “Pon… grah”. Tari reminds them both by mentioning that they both know they were glitching out just now and it’s not safe to stay in the real world because of that along with Lucks still out there hunting for them, followed up by Terapagos, Quaxly, and Flabébé saying in sorrow, “Tera… pago…”, “Qua…quax…”, and “Baé… aé…”. 
Theo then emotionally says to Tari “But… I had so much fun along with Ogerpon by being with you, Quaxly, and Flabébé! Even Terapagos! I haven’t had a human friend or have seen a Terapagos before and it’s really friendly and strong when it goes into its sparkly Terastal Form!”. This touches Terapagos and causes him to tear up from hearing such a nice thing to say. 

Slide 2: “I’ll… I’ll miss you all…” “Po… pon…”, Theo and Ogerpon mumble with sadness. Tari lightens the mood by saying “Don’t worry you two, I promise I will still come and visit you both here from time to time”. This perks Theo and Ogerpon up with them saying “Really!?” and “Ponyo!?”. Suddenly, they all hear two voices; “Crackerjack!” and “Grah pon!”. Tari, Theo, and the Pokémon all turn to where the voices were coming from a see… a second Theo and Ogerpon!? This surprises everyone! Tari says out loud in confusion “Wait… WHAT!?”.

Slide 3: All of a sudden, Tari, Terapagos, Quaxly, Flabébé, Theo, and Ogerpon all start to glitch out! Theo says in a nervous, distorted tone “Uhh… this is very weird…”. The glitching gets more intense, causing Tari to get worried and calls out “Sofia? What’s happening to us!?”. The glitching gets so intense to withstand to the point where Tari, Theo, and they’re Pokémon all disappear out of UJM!

Slide 4: It’s revealed that UJM crashed due to all the glitching and forced all of them out! Now with Tari’s consciousness back in her physical body, she gasps with shock whilst lying on the floor in MD-5’s office as Theo and the Pokémon return back to the real world also. Sofia, Masa, Lamar, and Terrin all look at Tari with concern as the former asks if she’s ok. Tari replies while feeling dazed with “Yeah…”. 

Slide 5: Lamar asks out loud in shock “Nani!? What the hell just happened!?” to which Tari replies with confusion “I have no idea, I think the game just kicked all of us out”. Terrin then looks at them and says “We’ll none of you seem damaged, just a bit dazed which is great because this could’ve been a lot worse” *Turns to Sofia* “Can you confirm why this just happened as I’m not the game expert here unfortunately”. Sofia briefly thinks and then goes over to the UJM cartridge and says whilst showing it “It must be… this!”.

Slide 6: Lamar asks Sofia with confusion “What? What about it?”. Sofia comes to the conclusion by saying “This UJM cartridge already has its own Theo and Ogerpon. So when it saw the Theo and Ogerpon here, it didn’t know what to do and booted the load of you out”. Theo and Ogerpon take this all in and then says to Tari “Woah! Does this mean that I along with Ogerpon get to stay with you?”. Masa then sternly intervenes to Theo with “No! This means we need to get you and Ogerpon back into your own cartridge!”. This annoys Theo and Ogerpon which prompts them to “Boo…” and “Pooon…” Masa.

Slide 7: Tari then remembers that Theo and Ogerpon’s game cartridge is back at the Speedrunners Arena at TASCorp’s company building and she suggests to everyone that they all should go and get it back. However, Sofia is put off by Tari’s suggestion and says “Uhhh… knowing Lucks, he definitely would’ve taken it back to TASCorp’s main building…”. Tari then says with annoyance “No, you got to be kidding me. Just when we were on to something!”. Lamar and Terrin adds on with “That makes things a little harder.” and “Dang, as if he needs anymore info than he already does!”. Terapagos is also annoyed by this and says “Terargh…”.

Slide 8: Everyone is stumped on how to proceed until Masa comes up with an idea! He asks Sofia “Sofia… do you remember Operation: Silent Giratina?”. Sofia thinks for a bit and answers with “Silent Giratina… OH! YES I DO!”. Immediately, Lamar and Terrin are both against this and say strictly “Oh hell no! I’m gonna stop you right there Masa! This wasn’t the original plan! We were going to train her up and get her and her Pokémon to join MD-5, that’s it!” and “Are you really about to resort down that route!? Surely you remember what came of this last time!?” respectively. Masa questions them both with “And how exactly do you both expect to get Theo and Ogerpon’s cartridge back, just by getting Tari to join?”. This stumps Lamar and he answers with “I… I’m not sure… but it’s a whole lot safer than going on this near-impossible mission that’ll Collision Course us into all of us being captured that’s for sure!”. 

Slide 9: Terrin starts to get increasingly angry and worried about Masa decision on “Operation: Silent Giratina” and says to him with rage “You can’t actually be serious! Don’t you remember!? WE DESTROYED OUR CHANCES OF RESCUING ZAYLA AND ZYGARDE BECAUSE OF THE STUPID RECKLESSNESS OF THIS PLAN!”. Terrin’s outrage silences everyone in the room. However, Tari oddly remembers something and says “Wait! D… Did you just say Zayla and Zygarde!?”. This causes the whole of MD-5, their Pokémon, and especially Terapagos to perk their ears up, with Terapagos shouting out emotionally in question “TERA… PAGO!?”. Tari quickly comforts Terapagos while saying “Hey, hey Terapagos! Calm down, why are you so shocked?” *Pauses* “Wait, why am I shocked about this too!?”. Masa then promptly questions Tari “Wait, how do you know about them both and why?”. Tari replies back in a confused tone “I… I don’t know the full picture but it sounds like Terapagos definitely does judging on how much of a reaction he had”. Terrin then calms down from his anger and takes a deep breath, he then says to Tari “I… I think I know why Terapagos is acting like this but… it’s quite a story… and an emotional one for me at that…”.

Slide 10: Terrin continues on with “When Masa brought up Operation: Silent Giratina, it reminded me of my partner, Zayla Astrida… and her Pokémon partner for life… Zygarde…. *Shows a picture of Zayla and Zygarde* See… as I mentioned, Zayla and I were partners and we have been together since college when we were around 19 years old. This is a photo taken at around 8 years ago. We both had a dream passed on by our ancestors about learning everything about what our legendary Pokémon partners have to offer and beyond everything that our ancestors discovered, and to educate everyone: Being at learning facilities, in conversations, or anyone who has a desire for adventuring and lore discovery just like we had. However, that was at the start of our relationship. 
Fast forward several years until it was around this time a year ago. An avid TASCorp scientist was looking for help in regards to a project to do with Meta Runner Arms. I was already acquaintances with this TASCorp scientist but me and Zayla along with Terapagos and Zygarde went to his lab to help him with his work. When we got there, we met a Meta Runner who was also part of this project. At the end of this however, me, Terapagos, Zayla, and Zygarde all got separated due to the project horribly failing and I haven’t seen her or Zygarde ever since. I have tried every sort of contact but none of it worked…”. 
Terrin and Terapagos then begin to cry in sorrow after remembering that backstory. Lamar and Sofia both go over to Terrin to give him a hug to comfort him along with doing the same for Terapagos.
Tari is indulged in this backstory and is feeling really sorry for what Terrin and Terapagos tragically experienced.

Terrin continues on by saying whilst brushing away his tears “And as it turns out, this other Meta Runner who helped out also when missing. The majority of the idea of this project escapes me, but I remember it had something to do with the Terastal Phenomenon, but also with Mega Evolution too.”

Slide 11: Tari is feeling really empathic but also odd because even though she doesn’t know about this backstory, it somehow… makes sense? She then says to Terrin “Wow… I would not have expected all of that backstory like that…. This makes me want to learn about my past and Terapagos’, along with Zayla and Zygarde’s too as for some reason, I’m getting the feeling that I have known those two, along with you and Terapagos for a really long time”. Terrin is surprised but also confused by Tari’s response, he says “So this somehow is making sense to you? How can this be I wonder?”. Tari then gets an idea and says to everyone “Oh hang on, I want to try something!” and searches up “Zygarde” in her Pokédex Vision, it comes up and reads: 

“Zygarde, The Order Pokémon, A Dragon and Ground Type, Zygarde has numerous forms it can become depending on how many cells it has gathered, it uses said forms to eliminate and destroy anyone who majorly threatens the ecosystem”. 

Sofia then asks Tari what she’s doing and Tari explains to everyone by saying “Well I have these weird vision abilities and one of them is basically an encyclopedia for Pokémon and I just used it to look up info on Zygarde!”. Everyone is amazed by this wondrous ability Tari has. Terrin then concludes his backstory with “After that incident at the lab, I joined MD-5 to go against TASCorp to what they have done to my Pokémon, Zayla, and Zygarde, as well as the other Meta Runner who was involved. It’s thanks to Masa leadership that we are still together, however, Operation: Silent Giratina will not get us any further!”. Masa then says “Well about Operation: Silent Giratina, I have a plan on how it can be successful this time”. Despite Masa’s claims, Lamar is still against it and gets annoyed and concerned as a result! He asks out of desperation to Sofia “Argh! Back to this again!? Sofia, help me out here! Tell this fool that this is a dumb idea!”. However, Sofia is actually siding with Masa’s approach and says “I’m sorry Lamar but… I can’t”. Lamar is shocked on Sofia’s response and says “What!?”. Sofia carries on with “I can’t!… The longer we wait, the riskier it is for Theo and Ogerpon to stay in our world, and I think with Tari and her Pokémon here, we’d actually be able to pull this mission off”. 

Slide 12: Tari then asks everyone with confusion “Uhh… what is Operation: Silent Giratina exactly?”. This just annoys Lamar even more and says “Grrr… god damn it! You see!? Now y’all gone and planted this dumb idea into her head!”. Masa is getting tired with Lamar’s attitude and becomes miffed himself and says “Get some sleep Lamar, that goes for everyone else. Let’s talk about this in the morning” and walks to his bed. Lamar begins to mock Masa by saying “Ohho and now you wanna go to sleep. Before y’all wanted to fight Tari and her Pokémon first, and now y’all wanna sleep”. Masa ignores Lamar’s taunting and keeps walking, this annoys Lamar even more and he says “Hey! I’m grillin’ you here! Come back! God damn it! Being emo as an Emolga doesn’t mean that you’re smarter you know!”. *Speaks to himself* “Stupid Masa thinking he knows what’s good for us!”. Theo and Ogerpon then laughs and the former says “Hehe… they’re funny”. Terrin then says to them “Yeeeeah… I haven’t seen Lamar act like that since the last time we did Operation: Silent Giratina, it goes to show how much he cares for our safety”. Sofia chuckles and says “Haha uhh… let me show you guys to your beds!”. 

Slide 13: Back at the run-down lab at TASCorp, Belle and Armarouge start to view the clips on the memory chip they found, hoping to find any leads on Tari and Terapagos’ past. The first video comes on, revealing a TASCorp scientist, he says “Is this thing on? Hello? Cool? Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool! *Clears throat* Dr Sheridan here, and this is an update on Project: Meta-Stellar Genesis! Wait, do I need to say my name? Gah, nah, it should be okay”.

Slide 14: *Next Video* “My life’s work is almost complete! Hahaha! Lucks is finally going to see the fruits of my research and more importantly… I’m not going to be fired! Wait, I probably shouldn’t have said that”. *Next Video* *Drinks some coffee* Anyway, the AI program housing the Terastal Phenomenon works perfectly. It can optimally beat any game and/or opponents you put in front of it, thanks to the AI housing Stellar Tera-Type Energy! All that’s left is to find a human host to download the AI into, and we can begin the final phase of my research! Hahaha!” *Drinks some more coffee* “Ah! Oh god! Oof! That’s some good coffee”. 

Slide 15: *Tiredly* “I’m… *yawn*… still… looking for someone. No one wants to be the host…. Not… much… tiiimmmeee…” *Bangs head accidentally whilst slowly falling asleep on the table and is more awake* “OH GOD! I don’t have much time! I gotta find someone NOW!” *Drinks even more coffee and turns to his Metagross in the background* “Come on Metagross! I need your help to find host!”. Metagross: “Tagross!”.

Slide 16: *Next Video* “Hehehe, I’ve hit the jackpot you all! I found someone and their Pokémon partner! Along with a few other generous volunteers with Pokémon that would be sooo much help in this! The former… she’s a Meta Runner here at TASCorp! And we have made some incredible progress! A really basic version of the Stellar Tera-Type AI has been downloaded into her Meta Runner Arm successfully! As well as one of the volunteers being incredibly knowledgeable about the Terastal Phenomenon and the other being knowledgeable about Mega Evolution! When it comes to the Meta Runner’s gaming prowess however, it has skyrocketed tremendously! Ohh, we are killing it aren’t we? I think we’re ready to take this experiment to the next level to gain mega results! I’m gonna use a more advanced iteration of the Stellar Tera-Type AI. Oh… this is gonna be so good. I have no doubt that she is gonna become the best Meta Runner at TASCorp!” *In an excited tone* Ohh Lucks is gonna love this hehe! *Proceeds to drink some more coffee, however, there is no coffee left* “Oh, I’m out of coffee…”.

Slide 17: Belle tries to play the next video, however, it comes up with “FILE CORRUPTED”. Belle and Armarouge are caught off guard by this and say confusion “What!?” and “Arma!?” respectively. 

Slide 18: *Corrupted video plays* *Sirens going off while Dr Sheridan is panicking* “Oh god no! No no no no no no! Please, please! No! C’mon! Shut off! SHUT OFF!” *Female voice in the background shouts out in horror* “Doctor! WHAT’S HAPPENING!!??” *Two different voices shout out in horror* “Sheridan!? WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS!?”/“RIN RIN! WHAT’S HAPPENING TO OUR G-!?” *All shout out in fear*
“AAAAAARGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!” *Massive Explosion* *Video ends*. 

Belle and Armarouge are in absolute disbelief recognising one of the background voices in that last clip! “That first voice in the background…!”/“Rouge… raaaaaa…!” Belle and Armarouge say on the brink of being speechless! *Both of them then begin to break down mentally* “Aaaaah…!”/“Rraaaagh…!”.

I’m working with a sommelier who shares original recipes and wine pairings (mostly natural, organic, or small-batch wines) on her Instagram. It's still new but growing. She wants to create a wine pairing book that matches her recipes with curated wines, which can be ordered online for readers to try.

We’re torn between two directions:

1. **A coffee table-style book** – beautiful photography, full-page images of the recipes, featured vineyards, and interesting wine facts. More aesthetic, something you’d leave out for guests to flip through.
2. **A more classic wine pairing cookbook** – still includes all the same recipes and wines, but focuses more on written content: wine region info, winemaking details, pairing principles, etc.

Both versions would have the same core recipes and wine pairings, just different in format, tone, and depth.

Do either of these ideas appeal to you? Would you use a wine pairing book? Would you be more likely to buy *or* gift something decor-focused and visual, or more text-heavy and informative?

I'm open to and welcoming of any feedback. We’re still very early in the process and just want to learn what would appeal to people. Thank you, everyone!

1ld5pwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SeanWil69/comments/1ld5pwy/chapter_seven_a_little_light/,Chapter Seven - A Little Light,"Tyler had forgotten what a good morning felt like.

He woke up without the usual fog clinging to his brain, his knee aching but manageable, the guilt from the day before slightly dulled by rest. The studio had given him the day off — technically to recover, but also, he suspected, because Sasha had insisted. He wasn’t sure if he was grateful or mortified. Probably both.

Still, for the first time since arriving in Heidelberg, he didn’t feel like a ghost drifting through someone else’s life.

He made a real breakfast — eggs, toast, even coffee — and didn’t wash down a pain pill with it. Instead, he limped out onto the tiny balcony of his flat and sat under the slow warmth of the late spring sun.

It wasn’t much, but it felt like something.

Around noon, boredom crept in, and with it, restlessness. The quiet had never been his friend — not when he was injured, not when he’d lost his draft, not now. So he grabbed his jacket and wandered down the cobbled streets until he found himself outside a bar that looked just the right amount of shady: mismatched chairs, chalkboard specials, a German punk song echoing faintly from inside.

Perfect.

Inside, the place smelled like beer and cigarette smoke, the kind that had been embedded in the walls for decades. He ordered a lager and sat near the window, nursing it slowly, still cautious with his leg but feeling better than he had in weeks.

That’s when the guy next to him leaned over.

“You look like you just got dumped, benched, or both.”

Tyler glanced sideways.

The man was tall, buzzed blond hair, arms covered in tattoos that wrapped up his neck, but with the kind of easy grin that made you feel like you’d known him forever. He raised his glass in a mock toast.

“Axel,” the guy said. “I own the bike shop across the street.”

Tyler snorted. “Tyler. Former hockey player. Current… nothing.”

“Ah. An existential crisis,” Axel said, nodding sagely. “We serve those here.”

They clinked glasses.

What started as a shared drink turned into two, then three. Axel was loud, hilarious, and deeply unbothered by most things. He told stories about getting banned from Oktoberfest (twice), broke down German curse words like they were poetry, and even offered to help fix Tyler’s busted bike — not that he had one, but still.

For the first time since arriving in Heidelberg, Tyler laughed. Real, breath-stealing, stomach-cramping laughter.

It was exactly what he hadn’t known he needed.

“Man,” Axel said, leaning back and stretching. “You’re all right. You’ve got sad eyes, though. That brooding athlete vibe. Girls probably love that.”

Tyler smirked. “I think I’m out of commission on that front.”

Axel gave him a look. “Heartbreak?”

Tyler didn’t answer, just took a sip of his beer.

But as the afternoon faded into evening, and the soft yellow lights of the bar began to glow, his thoughts drifted — back to Sasha. To her paint-smudged hands, the way her voice softened when she was worried, the way she had stayed with him when he fell apart.

He hadn’t stopped thinking about her.

And by his fifth drink, he was no longer fighting it.

“Don’t do anything stupid,” Axel warned, half-laughing as Tyler pulled out his phone.

“I’m just saying hi.”

“Mmmhmm.”

Tyler’s thumbs moved quickly over the screen, far too confident for how blurry his vision had become.

[Tyler, 11:48 p.m.]
U were right. Should’ve let u stay. I mean I’m glad u did. That’s not what I meant. Just. Thanks.

Pause.

Then, without thinking:

[Tyler, 11:50 p.m.]
Do u think about me when ur not around me? Cuz I think about u. Too much probably.

He stared at the screen, then winced.

“Yup,” Axel muttered beside him. “Definitely stupid.”

Tyler let the phone drop to the table.

But deep down, some part of him didn’t care.

Because tonight, even with the buzz and the ache in his leg and the soft regret settling in… he felt like a person again.

And that had to count for something.",1,1750110347.0,u_SeanWil69,0,1.0,False

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

1ld5pp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1ld5pp9/i_didnt_do_anything_for_fathers_day_after_my/,I didn't do anything for fathers day after my husband ruined my first mothers day,"My mom knows I'm super hurt and angry about this but she keeps telling me I should try & let it go and forgive my husband. I guess I want to know if you guys think I went to far. And I think my husband and I really need to figure out how to repair our relationship. Any advise or thoughts would be very welcome.

Our little boy will be one late this summer, so this was the first mothers day and fathers day for both me and my husband. My husband asked what I wanted for mothers day. I didn't want/need anything big or expensive. What I asked for is:

* For husband to get up with the little guy and get him fed while I pumped and chilled
* Breakfast in bed - just toast, scrambled eggs and coffee
* For us to take the little guy to the zoo for the first time. This was the main thing I was looking forward to.
* Go to my fav taco place for dinner

Between morning and afternoon naps we have about 4 hours of awake time. The zoo is abt 30 min away so I had figured if we left as soon as he got up from his nap and ate, we'd have a couple hours at the zoo and worst case he could sleep in the car on the way home.

We took my mom and my MIL out to brunch the prior weekend to celebrate them- his mom on Saturday and my mom on Sunday.  I also got them each a thoughful little present and flowers to celebrate their first mothers day as grandparents. I arranged everything and told my mom and MIL that we'd be celebrating on the actual day with just our little family and sent them a group chat (which included husband, my dad and FIL) just to make sure everyone is on the same page. My MIL is very pushy and overbearing so I didn't want there to be any surprises or confusion. 

The Saturday before Mother's Day, FIL sent my husband a text with a picture of all the mulch he just had delivered and said something like ""gonna be a busy weekend!"" or something like that. Apparently he had 300 bags of mulch (they have a big yard with lots of flower beds). That night my MIL called my husband and asked him to come over first thing in the morning to help his dad move the bags of mulch to where they were going to be used. She said since we weren't going to the zoo until after little guy's nap, that husband could go over and help for a couple hours and then come pick us up to go to the zoo. I was obviously not happy but she guilted him and said FIL was going to end up hurting himself if he moved all that by himself and that its not a big deal and should only take an hour or two. I told him his mom was doing this to try and get us to skip our plans and spend the day with them but he kept saying it's not a big deal, saying his mom promised it would only take a couple hours, etc etc.

I think most people know what happened - husband went over first thing, which means no breakfast in bed and I had to get up to feed the little guy. I was kinda pissed, but whatever. Spent time with the little guy then when he went down for his morning nap I texted my husband to let him know he should start wrapping things up. Then when little guy woke up 2hrs later I called husband to tell him I'd be ready to go as soon as I finished feeding the little guy. He told me it was taking longer than he expected but that he'd hurry. Like an hour and a half later husband called and said they weren't done but he was getting ready to come home.  It's 15-20 minute drive from MIL/FILs house. At that point we'd missed the window to make it to zoo so I told him to just stay there and finish and not worry about Mothers Day since he hadn't done a single thing I asked for. I don't think there wasy any doubt in his mind how pissed I was. A little later his mom called and said since we decided not to go to the zoo, that me and little guy should go hang out with her while ""the boys"" finished with the mulch. I admit that I was pretty pissy and told her I had no interest in spending time with the people who decided to ruin my first mothers day. I ended up staying home and ordering a pizza and binging Netflix.

When husband got home he was all apologetic and asked how he could make it up. I was still pissed and told him he could make it up by not ruining my first mothers day. I also told him he should plan on spending Fathers Day with his mom and dad bc me and the little guy were going to go celebrate Fathers Day with my mom and dad.

Since Mothers Day MIL has been texting and calling but I've been keeping conversations short and just giving very bland generic responses.

My husband has been apologizing and asking what he can do but honestly I don't want to bother. I know it's just a day and we can celebrate any time, like we did with my mom & MIL. But it was my first ever Mothers day. And it's not like I asked for anything expensive or difficult. The only difficult thing is he's incapable of setting boundries with his mom. And she's incapable of considering anyones feelings but her own.

This past Saturday he asked if I was still going to my parents then said he'd like to go with us. I told him he could do whatever he wanted but since I hadn't done anything for his dad he might want to go see him or something. We did both end up going to my parents and spending the day with them. It was actually a nice day. My dad insisted on grilling because of course he did but the weather ended up being nice and we spent a lot of time hanging out on their deck playing with the little guy. 

I'm not sure what if anything my husband did for his dad. I know he was getting a lot of texts during the day, I assume from his mom. She did send me a snippy text saying it was hurful to spend the day with my family at the expense of husbands but I told her she got to spend Mothers day with her baby boy so it's only fair that I spend Fathers day with my family. 

I know my husband was hurt that we didn't acknowledge him for Fathers Day but I told him while we were driving to my parents house that I'm just matching his energy. I admit that I haven't done anything to de-escalate the drama but I'm still just so hurt he continues to prioritize his mom's feeling over our little family. This isn't the first time his mom has done crap like this and I'm just so tired of it. She always oversteps and insists on doing what SHE wants. I'm doing better at keeping her at arms length and holding my own boundries but my husband is absolutely incapable of it.",2,1750110333.0,JUSTNOMIL,1,0.75,False

I’m working with a sommelier who shares original recipes and wine pairings (mostly natural, organic, or small-batch wines) on her Instagram. It's still new but growing. She wants to create a wine pairing book that matches her recipes with curated wines, which can be ordered online for readers to try.

We’re torn between two directions:

1. **A coffee table-style book** – beautiful photography, full-page images of the recipes, featured vineyards, and interesting wine facts. More aesthetic, something you’d leave out for guests to flip through.
2. **A more classic wine pairing cookbook** – still includes all the same recipes and wines, but focuses more on written content: wine region info, winemaking details, pairing principles, etc.

Both versions would have the same core recipes and wine pairings, just different in format, tone, and depth.

Do either of these ideas appeal to you? Would you use a wine pairing book? Would you be more likely to buy *or* gift something decor-focused and visual, or more text-heavy and informative?

I'm open to and welcoming of any feedback. We’re still very early in the process and just want to learn what would appeal to people. Thank you, everyone!

Ever felt the sudden urge to drop everything, rent a car, and drive three hours just because someone on the internet said, “This waterfall is basically an emotional reset”? Yeah, same.

I’m a 27M grad student in the Bay Area, currently living out the solo explorer arc, hiking, road-tripping, discovering hidden food gems. All is great, but lately, I’ve been craving someone to share the journey with.

Here’s the dream: spontaneous road trips with someone who won’t question why we’re driving 3 hours for “life-changing tacos” or “an allegedly magical waterfall.” I love late-night drives with good playlists and natural conversation, chill beach hangouts while watching the sunset, and the occasional “why are we here but I’m glad we are” kind of adventure.

Full disclosure, I don't have a car yet, but I rent often and am steadily leveling up my driving skills.

I’m looking for someone close-ish to my age, fun-loving, adventurous, and not allergic to spontaneity. It's all about good vibes and great company, but I’ll definitely share pics and describe myself in DMs, and would love to see who I’m potentially exploring new spots with. Let’s grab coffee first and just see if we vibe before hitting the road.

If you’re the type who packs snacks for a road trip and still forgets water, or who'd say yes to a random midnight snack run, we might just get along too well.

Shoot me a message if this sounds like your kind of chaos. Let's make some memories, questionable decisions, and at least one inside joke we can’t explain to anyone else.",1,1750110092.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Symptoms started with nausea, sulfur burps which all had gone by day 3 - plenty of water, IV liquid sachets, no more eggs for breakfast and pepto bismol
I have bruised really easily all over my legs (I do have young children constantly jumping on me) but I’ve counted 18+ bruises on both legs and a few on my arms? I do suffer from lipodema as well (bruise easily).

My suppression started with the nausea making me lose my appetite but as soon as I had a banana the nausea was gone within the hour. But the suppression continued throughout the week - at times I had to remind myself to eat just something as I was worried about feeling lethargic. I noticed any time I got really hot - I needed to drink more. 
My diet has consisted of bananas, chicken breast toasties with no butter and little cheese, usual dinners but not as much on my plate (spaghetti bolognese etc). I’ve completely cut down on coffee - I usually had 6-8 a day and now I just have my 1 in the morning and around 3pm if the tiredness kicks in.

Our little boy will be one late this summer, so this was the first mothers day and fathers day for both me and my husband. My husband asked what I wanted for mothers day. I didn't want/need anything big or expensive. What I asked for is:

* For husband to get up with the little guy and get him fed while I pumped and chilled
* Breakfast in bed - just toast, scrambled eggs and coffee
* For us to take the little guy to the zoo for the first time. This was the main thing I was looking forward to.
* Go to my fav taco place for dinner

Between morning and afternoon naps we have about 4 hours of awake time. The zoo is abt 30 min away so I had figured if we left as soon as he got up from his nap and ate, we'd have a couple hours at the zoo and worst case he could sleep in the car on the way home.

We took my mom and my MIL out to brunch the prior weekend to celebrate them- his mom on Saturday and my mom on Sunday.  I also got them each a thoughful little present and flowers to celebrate their first mothers day as grandparents. I arranged everything and told my mom and MIL that we'd be celebrating on the actual day with just our little family and sent them a group chat (which included husband, my dad and FIL) just to make sure everyone is on the same page. My MIL is very pushy and overbearing so I didn't want there to be any surprises or confusion.

The Saturday before Mother's Day, FIL sent my husband a text with a picture of all the mulch he just had delivered and said something like ""gonna be a busy weekend!"" or something like that. Apparently he had 300 bags of mulch (they have a big yard with lots of flower beds). That night my MIL called my husband and asked him to come over first thing in the morning to help his dad move the bags of mulch to where they were going to be used.

Redoubt 11

And so I am made.
Unmade.
Made again.
It happens slowly, like seaweed drifting in the current—so slow you don't notice, until one day you look at your hands and wonder whose they are.

Time moves differently here. The light bends at odd angles, as if the sun hesitates before rising, unsure of itself. The priests say nothing. They drink black coffee and pray under their breath. I’ve stopped asking questions. We are their guests, after all. Or maybe we’ve always been something else.

They call this place Redoubt 11, though the maps forgot it long ago. A monastery built on old bones, turned fortress. The sea surrounds us, soft and watchful.

I think about the sea more than I should.
It’s not the same water I knew in the north.
When the wind comes from Anatolikon, it smells like rusted anchors and old coins. But when it drifts from where Miklagard once stood, the scent turns strange—lavender and ash, like a garden dreaming of fire.

My grandfather used to tell me stories of these lands—of saints and cities swallowed by time. My mother never spoke of them. She just showed me her scars and said nothing.
I wonder if I’ll ever return to Visby. Or if Visby ever truly existed in the way I remember it.

The men I fight beside are scattered pieces of old countries.
One sings to the moon in Gaelic.
Another writes poetry in Finnish and burns it without reading it aloud.
There is a woman, too. Elvira. From Gotland.
I think my mother knew her, once, before everything.
But Elvira never looks at me long enough for the truth to surface. And I’ve stopped trying to ask.

She taught me how to use the axe. Said it was the proper way. I told her I preferred the smooth rattle of a submachine gun and the calming jabs of bayonets.
She smiled like someone who knew how the story would end.

When the heretic raiders came across the sea, my gun jammed. Just stopped, like it had fallen asleep. I had only the yatagan saber Vecihi lent me, its edge whispering in a language I couldn’t quite understand.

I would have died, I think. One of them came at me—a thing in armor that moved like it remembered being human.
Elvira split it in two.
“Axes don’t jam,” she said.
There was blood on her face, and she didn’t seem to notice.

After that, I stopped shaving.
I know you wouldn’t approve, Father. A proper Carolean doesn’t let himself go feral. But I’m no longer Carolean. The priests call me Várangos now.
They called my mother that, too.

We are the last. The 11th Várangian, holding Redoubt 11, on the 11th island of a chain tied to a windowsill, only to be abandoned in turn.
People once called these the Dodecanese. Now they don’t call them anything at all.

I try not to think about it.
Janus, our war priest, says nothing is coincidence.
He reads Revelation 11 before every raid, eyes rolled back like he's peering at something just behind the sky.

I don’t know if I believe him.
But some nights, when the wind moves in circles and the sea sounds like someone breathing, I think about St. John.
He was here, once. He wrote things down.
I wonder if he ever dreamed of men like us—
Or if he, too, woke up each morning and forgot his own name for a moment.

And yes, I may not shave anymore.
But I still polish my boots.
Some things matter, even here.
Even now.

1ld5gg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/analyticidealism/comments/1ld5gg8/i_think_i_disagree_with_kastrup_about_time/,I think I disagree with Kastrup about time.,"Here are my thoughts in a nutshell.
In my view, time is sequence, duration, change, flow, and flux. It is not derivative of any of these things, it is *identical* to them; isolated from them, the word becomes meaningless to me. I don’t understand what “time” even is if it’s not any of the above.

Here are the options as far as I can see:
1. My mind is static, but the universe flows through it.
2. The universe is static, but my mind flows through it.
3. Both my mind and the universe flow together. Neither is static.

For every option, I don’t see how this flow can be an illusion. For option 2, I could see how the movement of the *world* is an illusion, but *I’m* still flowing through it. To me it makes no sense to suggest that neither I nor the world are in flow, because then I would expect a universe that is absolutely and eternally static and unmoving. But that’s *not* what I experience. So there must be some *actual* flow going on here. I’m willing to grant that maybe the movement on one side of the equation is an illusion, but not on both sides. The question for me isn’t *if* flow occurs, I think it does. The question is about *what* is flowing.
So if there is *actual*, not merely illusory, flow occurring, then time *actually* exists. It’s not a separate thing from consciousness, it is simply “part of” the nature of consciousness. To be, to experience, even at the most fundamental level, is to experience flow; time.

Kastrup, as far as I can understand him, says that time is not fundamental. But isn’t he doing to time here exactly what he criticizes physicalists for doing to qualia? He has abstracted out of existence one of the most undeniable and fundamental components of conscious experience. Time to me is as real as the color red, the taste of coffee, and the touch of grass. I cannot imagine what a timeless experience would be like any more than I could imagine an experience without senses. I believe therefore that we have no more justification to eliminate time than we do to eliminate qualia.",4,1750109699.0,analyticidealism,1,1.0,False

It is very realistic for what actually needs to happen on the floor. The main principle is earning more for each step of a beverage and actually staffing appropriately. 

So a coffee Frappuccino and a CRC Frappuccino earn way different amounts. We’ve also been pushed to start hiring and have DM’s do a final interview so we can get good partners on the floor. 

I currently work in a store earning about 70 extra hours a week from this test. I know others in my area earning upwards of 95 extra hours. Just wanted to share. I know this is a big deal to all of us, and there’s a lot of nuance behind labor. 

Just wanted to make sure y’all know it’s being worked through as I feel some stores don’t have a very good communication loop and the information is not out there. ",6,1750109629.0,starbucksbaristas,2,1.0,False

They're in a relationship. I'm debating whether to apply for a full-time job at their employer.**

I'm (29F) a student in a grad program. Soon, it's going to be the time when I apply for post-grad jobs. I did an internship that I loved, and I'd want to apply for a job there.

AJ (37NB) was my supervisor for that internship. A couple of weeks into the internship, things felt flirty between us. I didn't think much of it at first. AJ's in a committed relationship so it wasn't going anywhere.

Instead, AJ kept making efforts to get closer with me, spend more time with me at work, and see me outside of work (in a group setting). Sometimes, they gave me way too much attention in front of our coworkers, which was embarrassing.

I want to be clear, I really liked AJ. But I didn't want messiness at work. I went back and forth on whether I thought this was inappropriate, and what I should do about it.

After my internship ended, AJ and I kept in touch a little, mostly about work-related stuff. AJ was basically offering to be a mentor to me.

I started a new internship. AJ was on sabbatical, so they started volunteering there once a week. At first, I thought this made sense - AJ had connections to this organization, and they often do volunteering.

But, things quickly got weird. Every AJ was volunteering, they'd come by my desk and chat, which wasn't where they were supposed to be. They'd come and see me multiple times per shift. They'd mention that they were planning to come see me, ahead of time. I could feel their eyes on me around the office. My supervisor didn't like it, and basically shooed AJ away from me.

I started to feel that AJ *really* wanted to see me. Then why not just ask me to hang out? Because they're in a relationship? But if that's not OK, why's it OK to hang around at my internship?

So then AJ started asking me to hang out. I said yes - I was glad that they were being direct. During, I felt a bit tense, I didn't feel comfortable opening up. They downplayed their relationship with their partner, which I didn't like. They told me that they felt like they'd been ""too uptight"" because they ""hold themself to a higher standard than they would hold others"" and ""question whether they have the right motivations for the things they do.""

My internship and AJ's volunteer gig ended. A couple of months passed and we didn't talk. They said I should come visit them at work, but I didn't go. I started planning for job applications. I'm having a lot of hesitation about applying at AJ's employer. But it's a good job, and I found out some other job opportunities aren't going to happen. So I hit up AJ to get one last check on the situation.

Me and AJ met up for coffee. AJ was super happy to see me. Their partner showed up unannounced, and she was not super happy to see me. It seemed like her and AJ were upset with each other. She kept trying to get AJ's attention and AJ basically ignored her in favor of me. AJ didn't seem shamed or trying to reassure her, just defensive/annoyed. The partner left pretty quickly.

At the end, AJ invited me to a party with their non-work friends the next week. I went and brought a trusted friend. The vibe with their partner was similar to the previous time. My friend's take was, ""The vibes were weird, man"" and ""They were giving you way too much attention"" and ""They're really intense towards you.""

So, I don't like how things are going. Nothing has really happened and it's possible that it's all in my head. But I know other people see it too. I felt concerned and anxious from the beginning, and that's gotten worse instead of better.

My question is, what do I do? Do I apply at this job? If I go back, AJ would probably be my supervisor again. And I feel like they'd make that happen. It's a really small team, like less than 10 people, so I'd definitely interact with them a lot regardless.

Regardless, what do I do about my personal relationship with AJ? Should I try to talk to them? I don't understand what they want. It doesn't seem like they're thinking about breaking up with their partner. If they're trying to have an affair, they're doing a really bad job.",2,1750109616.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

Around that time I had lost my job because the place was closing,nso crashing my car at that time truly felt like the end of the world. Losing that job though was probably a blessing in disguise.. I was able to get out of the restaurant industry probably wouldn’t have otherwise. 

No car, no job, $2600 on my credit card, no money in the bank. Actual hell. Not to mention I was having a hard time finding a job, not having a car didn’t help. Still drinking I was able to somehow get a barista job in October but only lasted a couple weeks and quit. Couldn’t find another job, so I went back to the barista job at a different location and I’ve been there since. 

I tried to stop drinking after I crashed my car and kept slipping up, but my last drink was on Christmas! I have a car (although having payments sucks, it doesn’t suck as much as not having a car), my credit card is down to 1k, and hopefully this fall I’ll be starting school again. Big corporate coffee shop pays for college online.   

Although I miss my old life, it wasn’t sustainable. Clearly. The money I made serving/bartending I find myself missing everyday but unfortunately that environment isn’t good for me or my sobriety. I also miss a lot of the people. 

Here’s to (almost) 6 months!

  ""New kid. Check it out,"" Shaunee said as she slid into the big boothlike bench we always claim as ours for every school meal served in the dining hall (translation: high-class school cafeteria).  
  ""Tragic, Twin, just tragic. "" Erin's voice totally echoed Shaunee's. She and Shaunee had some kind of psychic link that made them bizarrely similar, which is why we'd nicknamed them ""the Twins,"" even though Shaunee is a caf? latte-colored Jamaican American from Connecticut and Erin is a blond-haired, blue-eyed white girl from Oklahoma. ""Thankfully, she's Sarah Freebird's roommate. "" Damien nod ded toward the petite girl with seriously black hair who was showing the lost-looking new kid around the dining hall, his sharp, fashion-wise gaze checking out the two girls and their outfits--from shoes to earrings--in one fast glance. ""Clearly her fashion sense is better than Sarah's, despite the stress of being Marked and changing schools. Maybe she'll be able to help Sarah out with her unfortunate ugly shoe propensity.   ""Damien,"" Shaunee said. ""Again you are getting on my damn--""  
\--last nerve with your unending vocab bullshit,"" Erin fin ished for her. Damien sniffed, looking offended and superior and gayer than he usually looked (even though he is definitely gay). ""If your vocabulary wasn't so abysmal you wouldn't have to carry a dictionary around with you to keep up with me. "" The Twins narrowed their eyes at him and sucked air to begin a new assault, which, thankfully, my roommate interrupted. In her thick Oklahoma accent, Stevie Rae twanged the two defini tions as if she was giving clues for a spelling bee. ""Propensity--an often intense natural preference. Abysmal--absolutely horrible. There. Now would y'all quit bickering and be nice? You know it's almost time for parent visitation, and we shouldn't be acting like retards when our folks show up. Ah, crap,"" I said. ""I'd totally forgotten about parent visitation. "" Damien groaned and dropped his head down on the table, banging it not-so-gently. ""I'd totally forgotten, too. "" The four of us gave him sympathetic looks. Damien's parents were cool with him being Marked, moving to the House of Night, and beginning the Change that would either turn him into a vampyre or, if his body rejected the transformation, kill him. They were not okay with him being gay. At least Damien's parents were okay with something about him. My mom and her current husband--my step-loser, John Heffer--on the other hand, hated absolutely everything about me. ""My 'rentals aren't coming. They came last month. This month they're too busy. Twin, once again we prove our twin-ness,"" Erin said. ""My 'rentals sent me an e-mail. They aren't coming either 'cause of some Thanksgiving cruise they decided to take to Alaska with my Aunt Alane and Uncle Liar Lloyd. Whatever. "" She shrugged--apparently as unbothered as Shaunee by her parents' absence. ""Hey, Damien, maybe your mama and daddy won't show ei ther,"" Stevie Rae said with a quick smile. He sighed. ""They'll be here. It's my birthday month. They'll bring presents. That doesn't sound so bad,"" I said. ""You were talking about needing a new sketch pad. They won't get me a sketch pad,"" he said. ""Last year I asked for an easel. They got me camping supplies and a subscription to Sports Illustrated. Eeesh!"" said Shaunee and Erin together while Stevie Rae and I wrinkled our noses and made sympathetic noises. Clearly wanting to change the subject, Damien turned to me. ""This'll be your parents' first visit. What're you expecting?""  
  
  ""Nightmare,"" I sighed. ""Total, absolute, and complete night- mare. ""  
  
  ""Zoey? I thought I'd bring my new roommate over to meet you. Diana, this is Zoey Redbird--the leader of the Dark Daugh ters. "" Glad to be perted from having to talk about my own horrid parental issues, I looked up, smiling, at the sound of Sarah's ten tative, nervous voice. ""Wow, it's really true!"" the new girl blurted before I could even say hi. As per usual she was staring at my forehead and blushing bright red. ""I mean, uh. . . sorry. I didn't mean to be rude or any thing . . . "" she trailed off, looking miserable. ""That's okay. Yeah, it is true. My Mark is filled in and added to. "" I kept my smile in place, trying to make her feel better, even though I truly hated that it seemed like I was the main attraction at a freak show. Again. Thankfully, Stevie Rae chimed in before Diana's staring and my silence could get any more uncomfortable. ""Yeah, Z got that cool lacy spiral tattoo thing on her face and down along her shoulders when she saved her ex-boyfriend from some scary-assed vampyre ghosts,"" Stevie Rae said cheerily. ""That's what Sarah told me,"" Diana said tentatively. ""It just sounded so unbelievable that, well, I uh . . . ""  
  
  ""You didn't believe it?"" Damien said helpfully. ""Yeah. Sorry,"" she repeated, fidgeting and picking at her finger nails. ""Hey, don't worry about it. "" I worked up a fairly authentic smile. ""It seems pretty bizarre to me sometimes, and I was there. ""  
  
  ""And kicking butt,"" Stevie Rae said. I gave her my you-are-so-not-helping-me look, which she ig nored. Yes, I might someday become their High Priestess, but I'm not exactly the boss of my friends. ""Anyway, this whole place can seem pretty strange at first. It gets better,"" I told the new kid. ""Thanks,"" she said with genuine warmth. ""Well, we better go so I can show Diana to where her fifth hour class will be,"" Sarah said, and then she totally embarrassed me by getting all serious and formal and saluting me with the tra ditional vampyre sign of respect, closed fist over her heart and bowed head, before she left. ""I really hate it when they do that,"" I muttered, picking at my salad. ""I think it's nice,"" Stevie Rae said. ""You deserve to be shown respect,"" Damien said in his school teacher voice. ""You're the only third former ever to have been made leader of the Dark Daughters and the only fledgling or vampyre in history who has shown an affinity for all five of the elements. ""  
  
  ""Face it, Z,"" Shaunee said around a bite of salad while she ges tured at me with her fork. ""You're special. "" Erin finished for her (as usual). A third former is what the House of Night called freshmen--so a fourth former is a sophomore, et cetera. And, yes, I am the only third former to be made leader of the Dark Daughters. Lucky me. ""Speaking of the Dark Daughters,"" Shaunee said. ""Have you decided what you want the new requirements for membership to be?""  
  
  I stifled the urge to shriek, Hell no, I still can't believe I'm in charge of this thing! Instead I just shook my head, and decided--with what I hoped was a stroke of brilliance--to put some of the pressure back on them. ""No, I don't know what the new requirements should be. Actu ally, I was hoping you guys would help me. So, do you have any ideas?"" As I suspected, all four of them got quiet. I opened my mouth to thank them very much for their muteness, but our High Priestess's commanding voice came over the school intercom. For a second I was happy about the interruption, and then I real ized what she was saying and my stomach started to clench. ""Students and professors, please make your way to the recep tion hall. It is now time for this month's parent visits. "" Well, hell.  
  
  ""Stevie Rae! Stevie Rae! Ohmygosh I have missed you!""  
  
  ""Mama!"" Stevie Rae cried and flew into the arms of a woman who looked just like her, only fifty pounds heavier and twenty-some years older. Damien and I stood awkwardly just inside the reception hall, which was starting to fill up with uncomfortable-looking human parents, a few human siblings, a bunch of fledgling students, and several of our vampyre professors. ""Well, there're my parents,"" Damien said with a sigh. ""Might as well get this over with. See ya. ""  
  
  ""See ya,"" I mumbled and watched him join two totally ordi nary people who were carrying a wrapped present. His mom gave him a quick hug and his dad shook his hand with exuberant masculinity. Damien looked pale and stressed. I made my way over to the long, linen-draped table that ran the length of one wall. It was filled with expensive cheese and meat platters, desserts, coffee, tea, and wine. I'd been at the House of Night for a month, and it still was a little shocking to me that wine is served so readily here. Part of the reason they do is simple--the school is modeled after the European Houses of Night. Apparen  
tly, in Europe wine with meals is like tea or Coke with meals here--so no big deal. The other part is a genetic fact--vampyres don't get drunk--fledglings can barely get buzzed (at least on alcohol--blood, unfortunately, is a whole other issue). So wine literally is no big deal here, although I thought it would be interesting to check out how Oklahoma parents reacted to booze at school. ""Mama! You have to meet my roommate. Remember I told you about her? This is Zoey Redbird. Zoey this is my mama. ""  
  
  ""Hi, Mrs. Johnson. It's good to meet you,"" I said politely. ""Oh, Zoey! It is just so nice to meet you! And, oh my! Your Mark is as pretty as Stevie Rae said it was. "" She surprised me with a soft mom hug and whispered, ""I'm glad you're taking care of my Stevie Rae. I worry about her. "" I squeezed her back and whispered, ""No problem, Mrs. John son. Stevie Rae's my best friend. "" And even though it was totally unrealistic, I suddenly wished my mom would hug me and worry about me like Mrs. Johnson worried about her daughter. ""Mama, did you bring me any chocolate chip cookies?"" Stevie Rae asked. ""Yes, baby, I did, but I just realized that I left them in the car. "" Stevie Rae's mom twanged in an Okie accent that was identical to her daughter's. ""Why don't you come out with me and help me carry them inside. I made a little extra for your friends this time. ""  
  
  She smiled kindly at me.  
  
  ""You're more than welcome to come on out with us, too, Zoey. ""  
  
  ""Zoey. "" I heard my voice spoken like a frozen echo of Mrs. Johnson's warm kindness, and looked over her shoulder to see my mom and John coming into the hall. My heart fell into my stomach. She'd brought him. Why the hell couldn't she have come alone and let it be just her and me for a change? But I knew the answer to that. He would never allow it. And his not allowing it meant that she wouldn't do it. Period. End of subject. Since she'd mar ried John Heifer my mom didn't have to worry about money. She lived in a gihugic house in a quiet suburban neighborhood. She volunteered for the PTA. She was majorly active in church. But during the past three years of her ""perfect"" marriage she'd com pletely and utterly lost herself. ""Sorry, Mrs. Johnson. I see my parents now, so I better go. ""  
  
  ""Oh, honey, I'd love to meet your mama and daddy. "" And, like we were at any normal high school function, Mrs. Johnson turned, smiling, to meet my parents. Stevie Rae looked at me, and I looked at her. Sorry, I mouthed to her. I mean, I wasn't absolutely sure anything bad would happen, but with my step-loser closing the distance be tween us as if he were some testosterone-filled general leading a death march, I figured the odds were probably good for a night mare scene. Then my heart lifted way out of my stomach and everything suddenly got much, much better when my favorite person in the world stepped around John and held her arms out to me. ""Grandma!"" She enfolded me in her arms and the sweet scent of lavender that always moved with her, as if she carried a piece of her beau tiful lavender farm everywhere she went. ""Oh, Zoeybird!"" She held tight to me. ""I have missed you, u-we-tsi a-ge-hu-tsa. "" I smiled through my tears, loving the sound of the familiar Cherokee word for daughter--it meant security and love and un conditional acceptance. Things I hadn't felt in my home for the past three years--things that before I'd come to the House of Night I'd only found at my grandma's farm.  
  
  ""I've missed you, too, Grandma. I'm so glad you came!""  
  
  ""You must be Zoey's grandmamma,"" Mrs. Johnson said when we'd quit clinging to each other. ""It's so good to meet you. You have a fine girl, here. "" Grandma smiled warmly and started to reply, but John inter rupted in his usual I'm-so-superior voice. ""Well, actually, that would be our fine girl you would be com plimenting. "" As if on a Stepford Wives cue, my mother finally managed to speak. ""Yes, we're Zoey's parents. I'm Linda Heffer. This is my husband, John, and my mother, Sylvia Red--"" Then, in the mid dle of her oh-so-polite introductions, she bothered to actually look at me and her voice came to a breath-gulping halt midword. I made my face smile, but it felt hot and hard, like it was poured plaster and had been sitting in the summer sun and would crack all to pieces if I wasn't careful. ""Hi, Mom. ""  
  
  ""For the love of God what have you done to that Mark?"" Mom said the word Mark like she'd say the word cancer or pedophile. ""She saved the life of a young man and tapped into a Goddess-given affinity for the elements. In return Nyx has touched her with several unusual Marks for a fledgling,"" Neferet said in her smooth musical voice as she walked into the middle of our awk ward little group, hand extended directly to my step-loser. Nef eret was what most adult vampyres are, stunningly perfect. She was tall, with long waves of dark auburn hair and brilliant, almond-shaped eyes an unusual shade of moss green. She moved with a grace and confidence that was clearly not human, and her skin was so spectacular that it looked like someone had turned a light on inside her. Today she was wearing a sleek, royal blue silk suit with silver spiral earrings (representing the path of the God dess, but it's not like most parents knew that). A silver form of the Goddess with upraised hands was embroidered over her left breast, as it was over all the other professors' breasts. Her smile was dazzling. ""Mr. Heffer, I am Neferet, High Priestess of the House of Night, although it might be easier if you would just think of me as you would any ordinary high school's principal.  
  
  Thank you for coming to parent visitation night. "" I could tell that he took her hand automatically. I was sure he would have refused it if she hadn't caught him by surprise. She shook his hand quickly and then turned to my mom. ""Mrs. Heffer, it is a pleasure to meet Zoey's mother. We are so pleased that she has joined the House of Night. ""  
  
  ""Well, uh, thank you!"" my mom said, clearly disarmed by Nef eret's beauty and charm. When Neferet greeted my grandma, her smile widened and be came more than just polite. I noticed that they shook hands in the traditional vampyre greeting style, grasping each other's forearms. ""Sylvia Redbird, it is always a pleasure to see you. ""  
  
  ""Neferet, it makes my heart glad to see you, too, and I thank you for honoring your oath to look after my granddaughter. ""  
  
  ""It is an oath that is not a burden to fulfill. Zoey is such a spe cial girl. "" Now Neferet's smile included me in its warmth. Then she turned to Stevie Rae and her mother. ""And this is Zoey's roommate, Stevie Rae Johnson, and her mother. I hear that the two of them are practically inseparable, and that even Zoey's cat has taken to Stevie Rae. ""  
  
  ""Yeah, it's true. She actually sat on my lap while we watched TV last night,"" Stevie Rae said laughingly. ""And Nala doesn't like anyone except Zoey. ""  
  
  ""Cat? I don't remember anyone giving permission for Zoey to get a cat,"" John said, making me want to retch. Like anyone except Grandma had bothered to talk to me for an entire month! ""You misunderstand, Mr. Heffer, at the House of Night cats roam free. They choose their owners, not the other way around. Zoey didn't need permission when Nala chose her,"" Neferet said smoothly. John made a snorting noise, which I was relieved to see every one ignored. Jeesh, he's such an ass. ""May I offer you some refreshment?"" Neferet waved graciously at the table. ""Oh, golly! That reminds me of the cookies I left in the car.  
  
  Stevie Rae and I were just on our way out there. It was really nice to meet y'all. "" With a quick hug for me and a wave for everyone else, Stevie Rae and her mom escaped, leaving me there, even though I wished I were anywhere else. I stayed close to Grandma, lacing my fingers through hers as we walked over to the refreshment table, thinking how much easier this would be if it was just she who had come to visit me. I snuck a look at my mom. A permanent frown seemed to have been painted on her face. She was looking around at the other kids, and hardly even glanced in my direction. Why come at all? I wanted to scream at her. Why seem like you might actually care--might actu ally miss me--and then show so obviously that you don't? ""Wine, Sylvia? Mr. and Mrs. Heffer?"" Neferet offered. ""Thank you, red please,"" Grandma said. John's tight lips registered his displeasure. ""No. We don't drink. "" With a superhuman effort I didn't roll my eyes. Since when didn't he drink? I would bet the last fifty dollars in my savings ac count that there was a six-pack of beer in the fridge at home right now. And my mom used to drink red wine like Grandma. I even saw her throw Grandma a narrow-eyed  
, envious look as she sipped the rich wine Neferet had poured for her. But no they didn't drink. At least not in public. Hypocrites. ""So, you were saying that the addition to Zoey's Mark hap pened because she did something special?"" Grandma squeezed my hand. ""She told me that she'd been made leader of the Dark Daughters, but she didn't tell me how exactly that happened.  
  
  "" I felt myself tense up again. I really didn't want to deal with the scene it would cause if my mom and John found out that what had actually happened was that the ex-leader of the Dark Daugh ters had cast a circle on Halloween night (known at the House of Night as Samhain, the night the veil between our world and the world of spirits is thinnest), conjured some very scary vampyre spirits, and then lost control of them when my human ex-boyfriend, Heath, stumbled up looking for me. And I so didn't want anyone to ever mention what only a couple of people knew--that Heath was looking for me because I'd tasted his blood and he was fast becoming fixated on me, something hu mans do pretty easily when they get involved with vamps--even vamp fledglings, for that matter. So the then leader of the Dark Daughters, Aphrodite, totally lost control of the ghosts and they were going to eat Heath. Literally.  
  
  Worse--they were also acting like they wanted to take a chomp out of the rest of us, too, in cluding totally hot Erik Night, the vamp kid who I can happily report is definitely not my ex-boyfriend, but who I've sorta been dating this past month so he's my almost-boyfriend. Anyway, I had to do something, so with some help from Stevie Rae, Damien, and the Twins, I cast my own circle, tapping into the power of the five elements: wind, fire, water, earth, and spirit. Using my affinity for the elements, I managed to banish the ghosts back to wherever it is they live (or unlive?). When they were gone I had these new tat toos, a delicate collection of lacelike sapphire swirls that framed my face--totally unheard of for a mere fledgling to have--and matching Marks interspersed with cool runelike-looking sym bols on my shoulders, something no fledgling or vamp has ever had. Then Aphrodite was exposed as the rotten-assed leader she was, causing Neferet to fire her and put me in her place. Conse quently, I'm also in training to be a High Priestess of Nyx, the vampyre Goddess, who is Night personified. None of that would go over well with ultra-religious, ultra-judgmental Mom and John. ""Well, there was a small accident. Zoey's quick thinking and bravery made sure no one got hurt, and at the same time she con nected with a special affinity she has been given to draw energy from the five elements. "" Neferet's smile was proud and I felt a wash of happiness at her approval. ""The tattooing is simply an outward sign of the favor she's found with the Goddess. ""  
  
  ""What you're saying is blasphemy. "" John spoke in a tight, strained voice that managed to sound condescending and angry at the same time. ""You are putting her immortal soul in danger. "" Neferet turned her moss-colored eyes on him. She didn't look angry. Actually, she looked amused. ""You must be one of the Elders of the People of Faith. "" His birdlike chest swelled up. ""Well, yes, yes I am. ""  
  
  ""Then let us come to an understanding quickly, Mr. Heffer. I would not think of coming into your home, or into your church, and belittling your beliefs, though I disagree profoundly with them. Now, I do not expect you to worship as I do. In truth, I would never even think to attempt to sway you to my beliefs, even though I have a deep and abiding commitment to my God dess. So all I insist upon is that you show me the same courtesy I have already awarded you. When you are in my \`home,' you re spect my beliefs. "" John's eyes had become mean little slits and I could see his jaw clenching and unclenching. ""Your way of life is sinful and wrong,"" he said fiercely. ""Thus says a man who admits to worshipping a God who vili fies pleasure, relegates women to roles that are little more than servants and broodmares, though they are the backbone of your church, and seeks to control his worshippers through guilt and fear. "" Neferet laughed softly, but the sound was humorless and the unspoken warning in it made the hair on my forearms prickle. ""Have a care for how you judge others; perhaps you should look to cleaning your own house, first. "" His face reddening, John sucked in a breath and opened his mouth for what I knew would be an ugly lecture on how right his beliefs are and how wrong everyone else's are, but before he could respond Neferet cut him off. She hadn't raised her voice, but it was suddenly filled with the power of a High Priestess and I shiv ered in fear, even though her wrath was not directed at me. ""You have two choices. You may visit the House of Night as its invited guest, which means you will respect our ways and keep your displeasure and judgment to yourself. Or you may leave and not return. Ever. Decide now. ""  
  
  The last two words washed against my skin and I had to force myself not to cringe. I noticed that my mom was staring with wide, glassy eyes at Neferet, her face pale as milk. John's face had gone the opposite color. His eyes were narrow and his cheeks were flushed a very unattractive red. ""Linda,"" he said through his teeth. ""Let's go. "" Then he looked at me with such disgust and hatred that I literally took a step back. I mean, I knew he didn't like me, but until that moment I hadn't realized how much. ""This place is what you deserve. Your mother and I won't be back. You're on your own now. "" He spun around and started for the door. My mom hesitated, and for a second I thought she might actually say something nice--like she was sorry about him--or that she missed me--or that I shouldn't worry, she'd be back no matter what he said. ""Zoey, I can't believe what you've gotten yourself into now. "" She shook her head and, as usual, followed John's lead and left the room. ""Oh, sweetheart, I'm so sorry. "" Grandma was there, instantly hugging me and whispering reassurance. ""I'll be back, my little bird. I promise. And I'm so proud of you!"" She held me by my shoulders and smiled through her tears. ""Our Cherokee ancestors are proud of you, too. I can feel it. You have been touched by the Goddess, and you have the loyalty of good friends,"" she glanced up at Neferet and added, ""and wise teachers. Someday you might even learn to forgive your mother. Until then remember that you are the daughter of my heart, u-we-tsi a-ge-hu-tsa. "" She kissed me. ""I must leave, too. I drove your little car here, and I will leave it for you, so I must ride back with them. "" She handed me the keys to my vintage Bug. ""But remember always that I love you, Zoeybird. ""  
  
  ""I love you, too, Grandma,"" I said, and kissed her back, hug ging her hard and taking deep breaths of her scent like I could hold her in my lungs and exhale her slowly over the next month as I missed her. ""Bye, sweetheart. Call me when you get a chance. "" She kissed me again and then left. I watched her leave, and didn't realize I was crying until I felt the tears drip from my face onto my neck. I'd actually forgotten Neferet was still standing beside me, so I jumped a little in sur prise when she handed me a tissue. ""I am sorry for that, Zoey,"" she said quietly.  
  
  ""I'm not. "" I blew my nose and wiped my face before I looked at her. ""Thanks for standing up to him. ""  
  
  ""I did not mean to send your mother away, too. ""  
  
  ""You didn't. She chose to follow him. Just like she's been doing for over three years now. "" I felt the hotness of tears threaten the back of my throat and spoke quickly, willing them away. ""She used to be different. It's stupid, I know, but I keep expecting her to turn back into what she was before. It never happens, though. It's like he's killed my mom and put a stranger in her body. "" Neferet put her arm around me. ""I like what your grandma said--that maybe someday you can find the ability to forgive your mother. "" I stared at the door the three of them had just disappeared through. ""That someday is far away. "" Neferet squeezed my shoulder sympathetically. I looked up at her, so glad she was there with me, and I wished--for about the zillionth time--that she was my mom. Then I remembered what she had told me almost a month ago, that her mom had died when she was a little girl, and her dad had abused her, physically and mentally, until she had been saved by being Marked. ""Did you ever forgive your father?"" I asked tentatively. Neferet looked down at me and blinked several times, as if she were slowly coming back from a memory that had taken her far, far away. ""No. No I didn't ever forgive him, but when I think of him now it is as if I'm remembering someone else's life. The things he did to me he did to a human child,  
not a High Priestess and vampyre. And to a High Priestess and vampyre he, like most humans, is completely inconsequential. "" Her words sounded strong and sure, but as I looked into the depths of her beautiful green eyes I saw a flicker of something old and painful and definitely not forgotten, and wondered how honest she was being with herself . . .

  
**Chapter Two**  
  
  I was incredibly relieved when Neferet said there was no reason for me to stay in the reception hall. After the scene with my fam ily I felt like everyone was staring at me. I was, after all, the girl with the freaky Marks and the nightmare family. I took the short est way out of the reception hall--the sidewalk that led outside through the pretty little courtyard that the windows of the dining hall looked out onto. It was a little after midnight, which was--yes--a totally weird time for a parent open house, but the school begins classes at 8:00 P. M. , and finishes up at 3:00 A. M. On the surface it seemed to make more sense to have parent visitation begin at 8:00, or maybe even an hour or so before school started, but Neferet had explained to me that the point was that parents accept their child's Change, and understand that days and nights would for ever be different for them. On my own I decided that another plus of making the time inconvenient is that it gave a lot of par ents the excuse they needed not to come, without outright telling their kid, Hey--I don't want anything to do with you now that you're turning into a bloodsucking monster. Too bad my parents hadn't taken that out. I sighed and slowed down, taking my time following one of the winding paths through the courtyard. It was a cool, clear November night. The moon was almost full, and its bright silver light was a pretty contrast to the antique gaslights that illuminated the court yard with their soft yellow glows. I could hear the fountain that sat in the middle of the garden, and I automatically changed direction so that I was heading toward it. Maybe the soothing tinkle of the water would help my stress level . . . and help me forget. When I rounded the curve that led to the fountain I was walk ing slowly, and daydreaming a little about my new almost-boyfriend, the totally delicious Erik. He was away from the school for the yearly Shakespeare monologue competition. Naturally, he'd finished first at our school, and had advanced easily to the Houses of Night international competition. It was Thursday, and he'd only been gone since Monday, but I missed him like crazy and couldn't wait till Sunday when he was supposed to get back. Erik was the hottest guy at our school. Hell, Erik Night might be the hottest guy at any school. He was tall, dark, and handsome--like an old-time movie star (without the latent homosexual ten dencies). He was also incredibly talented. Someday soon he was going to join the rank of other vamp movie stars like Matthew McConaughey, James Franco, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Hugh Jack man (who is totally gorgeous for an old guy). Plus, Erik was truly a nice guy--which only added to his hotness. So I will admit to being preoccupied with visions of Erik as Tristan and me as Isolde (only our passionate love story would have a happy ending), and didn't notice that there were other people in the courtyard until a raised male voice shocked me with how mean and disgusted it sounded. ""You are one disappointment after another, Aphrodite!"" I froze. Aphrodite? ""It was bad enough that your getting Marked meant that you couldn't go to Chatham Hall, especially after everything I did to be sure you were accepted,"" said a woman in a brittle, cold voice. Mother, I know. I said I was sorry. "" Okay, I should leave. I should turn around and walk quickly and quietly out of the courtyard. Aphrodite was probably my least favorite person at school. Actually, Aphrodite was probably my least favorite person anywhere, but purposefully listening in on what was clearly an ugly scene with her parents was just wrong wrong wrong. So I tiptoed a few feet off the path where I could hide more easily behind a big ornamental bush and have a decent view of what was going on. Aphrodite was sitting on the stone bench closest to the fountain. Her parents were standing in front of her. Well, her mom was standing. Her dad was pacing. Man, her parents were really pretty people. Her dad was tall and handsome. The kind of guy who kept in shape, kept all of his hair, and had really good teeth. He was dressed in a dark suit that looked like it cost a zillion dollars. He also looked weirdly famil iar, and I was sure I'd seen him on TV or something. Her mom was totally gorgeous. I mean, Aphrodite was blond and perfect-looking, and her mom was an older, richly dressed, well-groomed version of her. Her sweater was obviously cashmere, and her pearls were long and real. Every time she gestured with her hands the gihugic pear-shaped diamond on her ring finger flashed a light as cold and beautiful as her voice. ""Have you forgotten that your father is the mayor of Tulsa?"" Aphrodite's mom snapped viciously. ""No, no, of course not, Mother. "" Her mom didn't seem to hear her. ""Spinning a decent slant on the fact that you're here instead of on the East Coast preparing for Harvard was difficult enough, but we consoled ourselves with the fact that vampyres can attain money and power and success, and we expected you to excel in this""--she paused and grimaced distastefully--""rather unusual venue. And now we hear that you're no longer leader of the Dark Daughters and have been ejected from High Priestess training, which makes you no different than any of the other riffraff at this wretched school. "" Aphrodite's mother hesitated, as if she needed to calm herself before continu ing. When she spoke again I had to strain to hear her hissing whis per. ""Your behavior is unacceptable.

I originally posted this, but I made it shorter because it was way too long. So I apologize for the longer post, but here’s the short version.🥲

About a year ago, my friend “Karen” found out she was pregnant with her third child. She didn’t have custody of her first two due to past violence (not toward her kids, but others witnessed incidents that involved DCF). I tried not to judge, because I know things aren’t always black and white.

She started dating a guy a month before getting pregnant, and moved in with him. Things seemed fine—until the baby was born. After that, their relationship got toxic and even violent. She physically attacked him several times, and once even hit him while he was holding the baby. Police were called, and she was arrested. She lost custody of her newborn shortly after and couldn’t stay at her boyfriend’s place anymore, so I let her move in with me.

I let her live with me for about five months, rent-free, while I was unknowingly battling stomach cancer. I was sick, constantly vomiting, and had no idea why at the time. I was still working, but couldn’t take long bartending shifts. She wasn’t working and kept saying she was applying for jobs, but I found out she was lying. (I called one place pretending to be her—she’d never submitted an application.)

Meanwhile, I started casually seeing a guy—we’ll call him Mike—and he came over to hang out. Karen blew up one night saying we were ignoring her and that I “always act like this” when I start seeing someone. I was embarrassed in front of Mike, and he distanced himself after that.

Later, I reconnected with someone else (Kevin), who happened to be her mutual friend. We started talking, and she again started acting out—interrupting us when we were alone, playing loud music, yelling weird things outside my door when we were intimate. One night, she accused me of trying to “control” Kevin and claimed she wouldn’t be his friend if he dated me. Then she casually told me she used to sell him nudes. That completely ruined things between me and Kevin.

I started noticing a pattern: she got angry every time I started seeing someone. She did this with a previous guy too—blew up at me, accused me of trying to get her kicked out of her old apartment, etc. Still, I tried to be supportive. We went out sometimes just to get her mind off stuff. Even when she saw her kids, I paid for everything—dinners, bowling, outings. I never asked for a dime.

Eventually, she got a job and promised to help with rent. She didn’t. Instead, she spent her first paycheck on a hotel with a guy, got her hair and nails done, and didn’t give me anything toward bills or the new iPhone I’d given her. I confronted her—not aggressively—just said I was overwhelmed and it didn’t feel fair. She flipped out, screamed, flipped my glass coffee table, and broke sentimental ornaments my grandmother gave me.

At that point, I’d had enough. I told her she had to leave. I was so upset I smashed the phone I gave her. (She still had her old phone, so she wasn’t without one.) I know that part wasn’t right, but I’d hit a breaking point.

The cops were called. I didn’t press charges. She left—and then made a Facebook post trashing me publicly. Some mutual friends sided with her, others didn’t say anything. I didn’t respond publicly because if they believed her, they were never really my friends to begin with.


A few months ago, I had a falling out with my (now former) friend “Karen.” Long story short, she lived with me rent-free for five months while I was going through cancer treatment and struggling financially. She didn’t help with bills like she promised, lied about applying for jobs, and constantly caused drama—especially whenever I started talking to someone new. It all escalated when she flipped a glass table and broke sentimental items after I asked her to pay me back for things she had promised to cover (like an iPhone I gave her). I told her to leave, and we haven’t spoken since.

Now to the current situation:

About two weeks ago, a man came into my new bartending job. He didn’t order anything—just sat down, stared at me for a bit while on the phone, and then left. A customer nearby said they overheard him saying, “Yeah, she works here.” I recognized him as one of Karen’s old flings. It made me really uncomfortable, especially since he had asked someone what time we closed.

Feeling uneasy, I made a vague Facebook post saying it was creepy and that I was worried someone was sent to check up on me. I never mentioned Karen’s name. But some mutual “friends” sent her screenshots, and she went off. She made a post directly naming me, calling me a liar and a bunch of other nasty things.

It didn’t stop there. She began calling my job repeatedly, claiming I was slandering her (again, I never used her name publicly). She told them I had issues with “Mexicans” and implied that’s who the guy was—odd, considering I hadn’t described him to anyone. My bosses already knew the situation and reviewed the security footage. Nothing I did warranted any kind of disciplinary action.

The calls and fake complaints kept coming. Strangers I didn’t know were calling my work to report made-up stuff about me. I found out Karen works at a bar just down the street from mine. After enduring this for a while, I called her boss to let them know she was harassing another local business. I didn’t demand she be fired—I just explained the situation.

A week later, she got fired. Turns out, she was already causing problems there too. I later heard she wasn’t just harassing me—others were getting threatening calls and even had their car keyed because of drama involving her.

Now she’s blaming me for her being fired and homeless, and some mutual acquaintances are saying I “went too far.”

So, AITA for standing up for myself and informing her employer about the harassment?",5,1750109400.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

1ld5bfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ld5bfd/hr_mirror_mirror/,[HR] Mirror Mirror,"In Dwight Washington’s time as a police detective in homicide, he had seen a lot. While frequently gruesome, most of it was utterly mundane: domestic disputes, drug overdoses, gang violence. The same cycle of meaningless carnage, day in, day out. Most cases were fairly open and shut, with only the details needing to be filled in. After eleven years, the particulars of each case started to bleed into one another, like the stains on the floor of a slaughterhouse. The scene in apartment 610 at 1149 Crosby St, however, stood out.

The apartment was a small, one-bedroom flat whose front door opened into the sitting area. The first thing Detective Washington noticed as he stepped inside was the windows. They’d been completely covered by a combination of newspaper, book pages, and masking tape. The living room coffee table had had a blanket thrown over it. Scanning the room, Washington spied a series of bare nails sticking out of the wall, like the blasted remnants of a forest after a volcanic eruption. Beneath each, another picture frame lay, face to the wall. The television set had been given the same treatment, turned completely around, its screen pointed opposite to the sofa.

The next space, the kitchen, had been subjected to an even more intensive effort to obscure just about every surface therein. The sink had been completely covered by a layer of cardboard, with a hole cut into it to allow the passage of water from the faucet, which, along with the knobs, had been completely mummified in masking tape. Every inch of the refrigerator, washing machine, oven, and microwave had likewise been covered in the same makeshift, piecemeal wrapping paper as the windows. The drawers, cabinets, and pantry had all been taped shut, though these had not been completely papered over, nor had the laminate countertops. The pantry door handle, however, had been. Out of curiosity, Detective Washington peeled back a strip of tape on the refrigerator, revealing the shiny metallic surface beneath. Nothing else of note stood out.

There wasn’t much to the apartment. This left the bedroom. Medical examiners and first responders milled about, documenting the scene, snapping photos, tagging evidence. There’d been no signs of forced entry. Windows, completely obscured as they were, were intact and locked. There, on the bed, lay the victim. Responding officers had found a driver’s license identifying the deceased as Denise Andrews, age 27. Police records indicated that Miss Andrews had been involved in an auto accident just over two weeks prior. No other vehicle had been involved. Miss Andrews’ car had been found, apparently abandoned, smashed into an intersection signal pole. There had been no sign of the driver by the time first responders had arrived on the scene. Following license plate and vehicle registration lookup, Miss Andrews’ name had come up, but attempts to contact her had failed.

The face of the body lying on the bed, however, barely resembled that on the license. The Denise Andrews in the photo was a bright-eyed, enthusiastic-looking young woman. The figure on the bed, though… Washington had never seen a face like that. Her features had been petrified in a rictus snapshot of perpetual horror. It was an expression he wouldn’t have imagined the human face capable of making - a perfect caricature of pure, undiluted terror.

The adjoining bathroom had been given treatment similar to the kitchen. Spigots, door handles, shower head, even the flush handle of the toilet, all wrapped up and completely covered. Another blanket hung above the mirror, held to the wall with a combination of masking tape and nails. On the bathroom counter rested the hammer, its head fully encased in tape.

“Every reflective surface in the apartment…” muttered Detective Washington to himself.

Returning to the bedroom, he noted the victim’s cell phone, tightly clutched in her hand. Dispatch records indicated that an emergency call had been placed from her number. The call had lasted approximately twenty seconds before being abruptly cut off.

Across from her, on the bedroom’s desk, sat her laptop, still open and powered on, its display occupied by what looked to be an audio recording program. A dialogue box overlaid the user interface, informing that the maximum recording length of 4 MB had been reached, and asking if the user wished to save.

Donning a pair of nitrile gloves, Detective Washington clicked the save button. The default file name displayed the date recording had initiated - yesterday. The same day the call from Denise’ phone had been placed. The same day the neighbors had called to report the screams. Minimizing the program, Detective Washington saw that the recordings had been being saved onto the desktop. Each with its own date. Putting aside the most recent, he moved the cursor over to the earliest file, beginning about one week prior, and hit play.",1,1750109355.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1ld57kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crush/comments/1ld57kr/office_crush_its_huge_and_i_hate_it/,office crush (it’s huge and i hate it),"I (f28) just started a new job three months ago and there’s this guy (m32) that started a month prior to me. I have this all of a sudden huge crush on him and i just can’t stop thinking about him. I wouldn’t say that i’m confused, i just can’t tell if he’s just being nice or maybe also likes me.

For context: We work for a big company and there are a lot of locations in different cities. I work in admin and he’s a consultant. We are set to work at our “homebase” but occasionally we can work in other cities, ex. if there are internal meetings or customer-related events that require us to go somewhere else. We can’t just work in city XYZ just because we want to (they have to give us overtime and compensation for travel, if we do, so we are only allowed to, if necessary). He works in location A and i in location B.

At first we got in touch in maybe my second week, when we were supposed to schedule some introductory calls with a couple of the head of’s. My teammate, which works in location A with him, made sure he’d include me in some of the prescheduled calls since he was also new. I wrote him a message to thank him and that was that. A week later i was supposed to work in location A and when i arrived i accidentally got lost and ended up in his office where he immediately knew who i was and he talked to me for like 30 minutes, he even interrupted a conversation with someone else, just to greet me and talk to me. Mostly he talked, but mainly because i wasn’t sure of the vibe and i’m new (i’m very careful and shy in the beginning). Though in that moment, i was so drawn to him. It didn’t help that he looked so damn hot too. 

We had lunch with some other people and didn’t talk much that day. Some of us went to have some after work beers at his go to place. He even showed me where he lives (it was right next to the bar). He came outside and smoked some cigarettes with me, after he loudly claimed he only smokes the ones i smoke and only when he drank. I didn’t really talk too much to him that night he also seemed a little stressed, i heard it in his voice. As it took me 2 hours to get home from location A, i left at like 8pm. 

After that we talked on the phone at least a couple times a week. Yes, we have a job to do, talking to each other is required - after all it is my job, to do some of the paperwork for the consultants. 
But everytime he calls me (and he always calls
me) for something that takes 3 minutes we end up staying on the phone for 30-45 minutes. And i could by the life of me not tell you what we talk about. It’s just random everything, no real context though. He seems to trust me with some things like people he doesn’t necessarily like and warn me about people that are hard to get along with.

There was also that one time i talked to him the morning after we had a work thing in location C and he had some to drink (i was sleep deprived and was supposed to drive, so i only had one small beer). We exchanged maybe 2-3 words that evening, i wasn’t really sure he knew i was there.
When he called me the next morning, he was like “you didn’t drink last night, is it because you don’t drink in general?”, so i told him i was way tired and had to drive thats why, i usually “can be different” and i heard that intrigue in his voice when he said “ooooh”. Maybe i also said it a little flirty idk.
Cue to a week later: friday. He came in to work in my location. Some of us ended up getting some drinks and even though i said i’ll have one beer only - you guys, we got WASTED. He kept em coming and he refused to let me pay a round. It was real funny and i made some remarks to him about how he looked good or he was dressed like an airline pilot. I was trying teasing him a bit (but i was trying to do in a cutesy way). He looked at me funny when i said those things - idk what to tell you it slipped out most of the time. Nothing more happened, we hugged goodbye and all in all it was a fun night. He messaged me the next monday and said something like “you really can be different ;)”. I was real embarrassed but i thought whatever.

We talk on the phone a lot and he comes to work at my location at least once a week. I assume it’s not because he wants to see me or anything like that, since he’s got some meetings when he works here. I don’t go to his location at all, because i only do admin, there’s no reason for me to be somewhere else.
He always asks me to join him for coffee breaks and lunch, not always one on one though. ALWAYS asks me to come to out of office activities/work events. 
One time he even waited for me outside in the rain, after working; he didn’t tell me that he was. i was so confused when i suddenly saw him there. He left maybe 15 minutes prior to me and just waited for me. Without telling me. When i came down he looked at me and remembered that i drive to work. He even missed his train waiting for me.

He remembers small details i tell him or he knows things about me, that i didn’t tell him. Also to add, he told me he has adhd, i told him that i do too idk if he caught that though.

My friend who i usually go to for advice thinks since the guy is very social, always on top and i tend to be in the background, that i shouldn’t think about it that way. he is quite sure that we couldn’t match. 

This is not my first office crush. This one is different though and i find myself starting to get real weird around him and i constantly want to be near him. It’s so stupid. Can someone tell me if i’m thinking too much into this? Also if any man that has adhd and ever had a crush enlighten me if those things are signs if a guy likes you or something? THANK YOU!!!

It’s about shifting the mindset to recognize these moments as opportunities rather than seeing posting as a separate, time-consuming task. I've found that even small breaks can lead to meaningful ideas if we just allow ourselves to focus in those brief stints.

Welcome to the Nomad Revolution. You’re not just running from the cubicle. You’re charging into a new era—one where borders are suggestions, not barriers. But the world’s not as open as your Instagram feed. There’s paperwork. There’s fine print. There’s a digital nomad visa for that.

### Why Digital Nomad Visas Matter

#### The Death of the Old Work Model

The 9-to-5? Fossilized. The pandemic didn’t just shake the office walls—it bulldozed them. Now, the laptop is your passport. But governments? They want a piece of the action.

A digital nomad visa is a government-issued permission slip. It lets you work remotely in a foreign country—legally. Not a tourist visa. Not a work permit. It’s the third way.

Tourist visas are for beach selfies, not spreadsheets. Overstay, and you’re persona non grata. Digital nomad visas let you stay longer, work openly, and sometimes even open a bank account.

### Eligibility: Who Gets In?

#### Income Requirements

Most countries want proof you’re not a broke backpacker. Bank statements, contracts, or pay slips. Minimums vary—do your homework.

#### Proof of Work

Show you’re employed or self-employed abroad. No local hustles allowed. The world wants your tax dollars, not your job applications.

#### Health Insurance Demands

Global health insurance is often mandatory. No free rides in foreign ERs. Get covered or get denied.

### The Fine Print: Pitfalls and Perks

#### Taxation Traps

Some countries tax you after a certain stay. Read the fine print. Double taxation is the silent killer of nomad dreams.

#### Healthcare Headaches

Not every country has world-class hospitals. Research before you relocate. Emergencies don’t care about your Instagram grid.

#### Community Perks

Some visas come with perks—networking events, co-working discounts, even language classes. Leverage them.

### How to Choose Your Nomad Base

#### Cost of Living Calculus

Cheap rent doesn’t always mean cheap living. Factor in food, transport, and fun. Spreadsheet it.

#### Internet Infrastructure

Wi-Fi is your lifeline. Dead zones are your enemy. Research speeds, availability, and backup plans.

#### Time Zone Tactics

Work-life balance is a myth if your meetings are at 3 a.m. Pick a base that matches your clients—or your sleep schedule.

#### Safety and Stability

Political unrest, crime, or natural disasters can upend your plans. Safety first, adventure second.

### The Application Process: Expect the Unexpected

#### Paperwork Purgatory

Gather documents. Fill forms. Wait. Rinse, repeat. Bureaucracy is a universal language.

#### Approval Timelines

Some countries move fast. Others take months. Plan ahead or get stuck in limbo.

#### Common Mistakes

Incomplete forms, missing documents, expired passports. Rookie errors cost time and money.

### Life After Arrival

#### Integration Hacks

Join local groups. Learn the language. Don’t be the expat cliché.

#### Avoiding Isolation

Remote work can be lonely. Co-working spaces, meetups, and online communities are your lifeline.

#### Local Laws and Customs

Ignorance isn’t an excuse. Learn the rules—written and unwritten.

### The Future of Digital Nomad Visas

#### Trends to Watch

More countries are jumping on the bandwagon. Requirements are evolving. Stay updated or get left behind.

#### Will Governments Catch Up?

Visas are just the beginning. Tax laws, healthcare, and infrastructure will follow. The world is waking up to the nomad economy.

### Conclusion: The World Is Open—Almost

Borders are blurring. Opportunities are multiplying. But the digital nomad visa is your backstage pass. Get it right, and the world is yours. Get it wrong, and you’re grounded. Choose wisely. The revolution is just getting started.",1,1750108891.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

What should’ve been the happiest time of my life has ended up being the hardest.

My wife and I argue constantly. She nitpicks everything I do, how I make coffee, how I clean, how I behave around her family, even though I do a lot for the house and for her. I do the shopping, organise cleaners, wash dishes, pay for everything we do, bills etc. But I feel like it’s never enough. She often disrespects me in front of others, especially my family, and makes comments comparing them to hers. She adds to value no the house, no cooking etc or just general proactivity.

Recently I caught her in multiple lies about what she’s told her family about our relationship and she continued lying even when I gave her the chance to come clean. I ended up looking through her phone and found that she had separate family WhatsApp groups created during our fights, deleted messages from her brother, and calls with her dad where she told him things she never told me. I dont care that she speaks to her family, i care that she has to lie about it.

After one of our biggest arguments I asked for a two week break. We’ve had serious family involvement now. Both sets of parents have weighed in. Her parents defend her a lot but mine have told me to stand up for myself. My dad told hers that her behaviour, swearing has really disappointed him. The family dynamic now feels ruined.

I still care for her and I miss who she was when we got married. But I don't trust her. She prioritises her family over us, twists things around, and I feel like I’ve been walking on eggshells for a year. At the same time, I’m questioning myself. Have I been too harsh? Was I wrong to push her family away when I felt disrespected? Have I contributed more to the fights than I realise?

Right now I’m staying at my parents and she’s at our home. We agreed to have no contact for 2 weeks.

I don’t know if we can rebuild from this. But I also don’t know if I’m giving up too soon.

Anyway, in the early days of postpartum I was so afraid he wouldn’t want to sleep in his mini crib we have in our room so I made it a point to do as many naps as I could a day in there. I sort of regret not holding him more when he was small and squishy but I had all of social media sleep training mom crap on my brain. Now here we are, he takes 1 nap in the car seat usually to/from our daily out of the house time to a coffee shop, store, park. 1-2 naps in his crib in our room, usually a contact nap, and then usually he has a nap laying beside me on our couch but I’m sitting up scrolling/watching tv. Is this bad? Normal?

1ld520d,https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/1ld520d/recommend_a_horrorparanormal_podcast_to_someone/,Recommend a horror/paranormal podcast to someone who *almost* likes the Magnus Archives [Spoilers],"I've gotten pretty deep into The Magnus Archives and feel like I'm losing the will to continue. I really like some of what it does, which is why I've listened to almost 90 episodes, but some of the things that disrupt my immersion seem to be happening more frequently. I'm also conscious of this sub's 6th rule and haven't come here to 'bash' an incredibly popular podcast; but *because* it's so popular I think I'm going to need to be fairly specific about the things that are putting me off. This is partly because some of the same issues seem to run across the genre. Spoilers and criticism to follow. Sorry in advance for that, and for what I suspect will be a long post. If you love TMA and consider it the height of the genre, I'm not here to convince you otherwise - I'm just hoping that maybe someone else has had a similar experience and gone on to find something that scratched the same itch a little better. 

TMA does a number of things really well. It's imaginative, occasionally very creepy, and I really like that a vast collection/archive of individual stories are often contributing, in small details as well as major themes, toward a much larger narrative. Many scenes have stuck with me, proving the quality of the writing behind them and the immersion those episodes achieved. In (if I've got the title right) EP20 'Desecrated Host II,' for example, the moment >!Father Burroughs realises he is not consuming consecrated bread but actually human flesh!< is excellently-written horror. It is surprising, disturbing, and at the same time perfectly coherent with the narrative and once you realise you know it was inevitable all along. That was a great episode, and was an example of the kind of writing and production that kept me going after a start that felt quite inconsistent in places. 

The trouble is not just that the inconsistency breaks my immersion - and thus enjoyment - but that some of the specific inconsistencies are becoming more common. Perhaps someone who's listened to the entire series can assure me otherwise, but it feels like by episode 89, where I have currently left it, the content and narrative structure of the show has decisively shifted toward its weaknesses. 

I occasionally found the the delivery of Jonathan Sims to be a little over-the-top when he read statements; the 'spooky campfire story' affectation doesn't get me into the scene, but his occasional forays into affecting 'madness' were actually off-putting. Combined with the inexplicably low volume of each episode (the fact I cannot hear a thing through my airpods while simply riding a bus has been an enduring frustration), the reading of Jane Prentiss in episode 32 led to me giving up on the episode partway through (and thus missing crucial plot information for the end of the first season). But these were the things I was content to live with; some dissatisfaction with production (mainly volume) and with delivery (what felt like overly-affected voice-acting) which both, in different ways, sometimes made it difficult for me to stay present in the story. Which, as I'm certain any horror fan understands, is crucial to its enjoyment. 

As the show has shifted toward more presentation of the story-which-surrounds-the-stories (I don't know how to say that - but the real-time story of Jonathan Sims and his associates), obviously that does (at least) two things: it makes it more necessary for the voice acting to be believable, and it makes it more necessary that the meta narrative be compelling. I feel like the show is faltering on both of those those fronts, and it doesn't help that I just recently got another dose of over-acted 'madness' affectation in 'Dig' soon after probably the most wooden voice performance of the series (the police officer in 'The Eyewitnesses'). And all in between that, it's ever more of Jonathan Sims himself, wtih ever more dialogue with and from the surrounding characters. Dialogue which feels quite repetitive in its delivery (I really don't think people 'um' and sigh nearly as much as seems to be written into their lines) and while I appreciate that it's surely world-building toward narrative goals I cannot yet appreciate, I'm struggling with the persistent sense that I'm listening to people reading their lines to each other. For whatever various reasons, I am struggling to suspend my disbelief. It's not such an issue when the premise of an episode is literally that *I am listening to a statement being read,* but when it is supposed to be organic dialogue I struggle. 

This is probably the point at which I ought to reiterate that I am not here just to criticise the show. I wouldn't have listened to 90 epdisodes if I wasn't enjoying it. I am getting little joy out of writing out some of these critiques; the impulse to do so itself an indication of my frustration. It is like I have an itch that I can *almost* scratch, but the instrument I was using to scratch it has become somehow shorter and no longer reaches. If someone were to reply saying, 'Yes, you are actually just in the middle of a rough patch of the show - it gets better again later on,' I may be persuaded to pick it up again. It just feels like it's taken a turn toward a slightly different kind of show than it was at the beginning, and if that's the case I have listened far enough along this new trajectory that my confidence has just about run out. 

If anyone reads this and is inspired to make a recommendation, I'll add some non-TMA context. I mostly enjoyed season 1 of The White Vault - although the authorial decision to make each character break into ecstatic reverie at any mention of coffee began to wear extrememly thin. '>!Oh no, there's a monster down here hunting me! What if I never get to drink coffee again?!< Oh god, coffee! Ohhhh my gooooddddd, coffeeeee oohhhhhhhh coffee eeeuughhhhhgooooodddddd....' Self-indulgent nonsense that I assume was meant to be funny but just served to remind me that I *wasn't* listening to found footage. SCARE ME. Don't wink at me. 

Spooked has produced, by far, the most epidodes which have genuinely *spooked* me. Especially in their earlier seasons when it seemed they had more to choose from. Obviously their production value is high and there is often music and atmospheric sound playing around their stories, but in many ways it is precisely the combination of matter-of-factness combined with the content of the stories which produces the chill. Of course, a key difference between (e.g.) Spooked and TMA is that there is no way for Spooked to hold together an over-arching narrative - that is one of the things that drew me to TMA and which still holds some appeal. 

I also recently listened to a few episodes of The Black Tapes. I found it quite promising, and initially enjoyed the sort of 'Serial'-style format. But one if its main characters, Dr Strand, also quite *line-read-y* in his delivery, and thus I am once again struggling to remain immersed. 

If you've made it this far, congratulations and thank you. If any of this strikes a chord and you want to offer a recommendation, thank you even more.",2,1750108728.0,podcasts,0,1.0,False
1ld51y9,https://i.redd.it/gq7h1inrvc7f1.jpeg,Final form... (maybe),"I've been ""pulling shots"" on the cheaper De'Longhi 15 bar machines for about a decade now. Over time I got one for work and then I a Berratza Encore grinder. I also got some bottomless portafilters for each unit. They make good espresso and with enough time and effort they can usually pull a pretty ok shot. But I wasn't fully satisfied with consistency and the inner coffee snob decided we should upgrade.

Early this year I decided I would definitely be upgrading and began my search. Countless hours went into finding the best machines for my budget that would check of as many boxes as I could. First I knew I wanted a plumbable espresso machine. Second I knew it needed to be as quite as possible. I knew I wanted an E61 group head with flow control and pid. All of this eventually landed me on the Bezzera Aria and it is a fine machine. It's not the biggest, baddest, or bestest machine or there; but for the price I got it... It checks every box and is pulling some of the best shots I've ever had. 

Happy! Right?! Well no I hadn't plumbed it. I needed to overhaul the clear liquid they try to pass off as water here in the cities of Florida. So we did a tankless RO prefilter into the BWT Bestmax S. The prefilter is for the crazy hardness and disgusting stench of swampy eggs notorious for Florida water. Mostly the Bestmax is not a cheap filter and this system serves only the new sink-side water spout and the Espresso machine. So I can change it the cartridges on the RO cheaper in between the Bestmax changes. Yeah, you are right. It definitely is overkill, but I digress.

Happy, Right!? No. Now I learned the hard way that the Encore grinder I owned could not, even with mods, produce the fairy dust like grounds I wanted from my very light home roasted beans. So... A grinder, but which one!? Honestly I almost got the DF83v, but I was afraid of missing my second point. It needed to be quite. So I procured a Gevi Grindmaster, which I feared might still be too loud. Turns out that the rotary pump is still quieter than the Grindmaster, but the Grindmaster was such a huge improvement over the Encore that I was given the thumbs up by the partner desiring sleep during my coffee brew time.

So... Happy?! For the time being. 

Happy brews to you all!",10,1750108724.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again. I know, it sounds weird but I promise it can be kinda fun.

What I expect from you:

~ Good communication and someone who likes to go one random coffee or boba runs. Anime lovers and gamers are a plus as well. Would love a gamer friend/girlfriend.",2,1750108703.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1ld51l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/comments/1ld51l4/what_am_i_tipping_for/,What am I tipping for?,"My town holds an event at our convention center every year. They hire temp workers to sell food. Now, I know for a fact these Temps are paid $10-$12 an hour so they don't rely on minimum wage. Last year, I ordered a medium coffee. Lady handed me an empty cup and lid. Then spun the pinpad around. Guess what? Asked for a tip. I had to pour my own coffee and add stuff to it but expected to tip because? And she tried to pretend not look at me select no tip. 


A few years ago, same event, same convention center. A girl bought a bottle of water. The worker turned around, pulled it out of the cooler and handed it to the girl. The starts to walk away, only for the worker to scream out, ""YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TIP ME?!"" Within the next hour, the tip jar was gone. 


I went to 5 guys (for the first and last time) and the lady at the counter glared at me when I walked in. She spat ""What do you want?!"" when I got up the counter. I told her my order while she basically slammed down the buttons in anger. And wouldn't you know, she expected a tip. For what? Treating me like dirt? I hit no tip and she glared even harder. She probably would have thrown the bag of food at me. 


I went to a coffee shop. And a lady took my order. Then immediately let the counter to go hang out with the manager and do their hair and makeup. I'm not kidding. The manager had a hair straightener and curlers in hair. They left everything to a single employee who was clearly brand new because they couldn't tear themselves away from their makeup and Chipotle. They even made another customer want until the new girl was done fixing my drink to help. But you guessed it, she wanted a tip! For pressing buttons on a pinpad.


So my question is...what am I tipping for? I work fast food. I do all these things and more, but I don't get tips. Why are they allowed tips for doing so much less. They are also paid a wage above minimum wage so they aren't on servers salary so why do they get tipped for doing less?",20,1750108697.0,EndTipping,9,0.88,False
1ld50op,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfumes/comments/1ld50op/ehhhhhh/,Ehhhhhh,"Alright, I've tried TWO Al-Rehab perfumes so far, and I can definitely say

I do NOT like either. 

Which is a disappointment with all the hype the two get 😔😔. 

Earlier this year, I was on the hunt for a coffee perfume and saw a lot of people recommend French Coffee by Al-Rehab as a great budget friendly place to start. Ordered it on Amazon, and when it came, i was... Very conflicted, to say the least.

It smelled so heavily synthetic to me, added with the alcohol in it, it just made me have a migraine. To my nose, it smelled super sickly sweet (best way i can describe from memory) and just not pleasant at all. I left it for a while, hoping that, perhaps, if I just came back to it, maybe I'd change my mind.

NOPE. 

Absolutely hate it, and smelled nothing of the coffee I was going for. 

Then, recently, I've had the thought of trying out chocolate perfumes. And hey! Al-Rehab came up once again (Choco Musk)! Said, you know what, screw it, maybe this time will be better 😊

.... Suffice to say, it, too, is a major fail to me. 

It also held that heavily synthetic scent that French Coffee had, to me personally. I could get chocolate from it but just... No. Even my mom made a face at the smell and said it smelled like something an elder would wear. 

So, back to the drawing board with my coffee perfumes. That one sounds nigh impossible to find, when looking for a photorealistic scent, like opening a bag of ground coffee or being within the coffee aisle.
My only light at the end of the tunnel is that Chocolate Milk by Sugar Milk Co is my only favorite chocolate perfume at the moment (literally the only, since its the only choco scent I've ever had and smelled). 

Now, if you'll excuse me, my nose still burns from Choco Musk and i can still smell it. I'll be attempting to chase it away before another headache ensues.",1,1750108639.0,Perfumes,3,0.67,False

I have currently a gas stove (Karrimor Explore Stove) paired with some Decathlon pots (quite heavy as I used them previiusly for camping) and I want to move into alcohol stoves. I'm hammocking and I have a 50L backpack for the context and my current setup fits properly and leaves some space for additional clothes and food.

My cooking pots take 6,2l of space, trangia 25 takes 4l, the 27 takes 2,7l and 28 mini takes 1,2l

I'm looking to buy 28 Mini HA together with 25-2 HA or 27-2 HA. The thing is that Mini seems reasonable to take as you don't always want to cook something fancy that requires a lot of pots.

27-2 HA seems great for one but it's actually only 200g lighter and a bit smaller the 25-2 HA.

I thought about getting Mini HA together with 25-2 HA for different use cases but at the same time I'm looking at 27-2 as I'll mostly go into woods alone or in a group of 2, it could happen that the group will get bigger as I try to get my friends interested in the hobby though.

I generally like cooking normal meals and I like making proper coffee using drippers. What would be your advice here? I'm almost certain that I'd find a use case for the 28 Mini and both 27 or 25 seem reasonable to get as well, but the weight difference between 27 and 25 doesn't seem like much and kind of negates the bonus from using 27 for me. Even if I went into the woods alone but wanted to cook something fancier I think that the 25 would be better for that task, am I looking at it wrong?

Additionally I think about trangia bottles, 0,3 seems the best to get for short trips, especially solo, but how about going with let's say 3 people for 3 days (2 nights)? Is it better to take 0,3 and 1l or just go with 0,5l?

Hey guys, I shortened it a lot this time so I’m sorry for the last post🥲

About a year ago, my friend “Karen” found out she was pregnant with her third child. She didn’t have custody of her first two due to past violence (not toward her kids, but others witnessed incidents that involved DCF). I tried not to judge, because I know things aren’t always black and white.

She started dating a guy a month before getting pregnant, and moved in with him. Things seemed fine—until the baby was born. After that, their relationship got toxic and even violent. She physically attacked him several times, and once even hit him while he was holding the baby accidentally hitting the child. Police were called, and she was arrested. She lost custody of her newborn shortly after and couldn’t stay at her boyfriend’s place anymore, so I let her move in with me.

I let her live with me for about five months, rent-free, while I was unknowingly battling stomach cancer. I was sick, constantly vomiting, and had no idea why at the time. I was still working, but couldn’t take long bartending shifts. She wasn’t working and kept saying she was applying for jobs, but I found out she was lying. (I called one place pretending to be her—she’d never submitted an application.)

Meanwhile, I started casually seeing a guy—we’ll call him Mike—and he came over to hang out. Karen blew up one night saying we were ignoring her and that I “always act like this” when I start seeing someone. I was embarrassed in front of Mike, and he distanced himself after that.

Later, I reconnected with someone else (Kevin), who happened to be her mutual friend. We started talking, and she again started acting out—interrupting us when we were alone, playing loud music, yelling weird things outside my door when we were intimate. One night, she accused me of trying to “control” Kevin and claimed she wouldn’t be his friend if he dated me. Then she casually told me she used to sell him nudes. That completely ruined things between me and Kevin.

I started noticing a pattern: she got angry every time I started seeing someone. She did this with a previous guy too—blew up at me, accused me of trying to get her kicked out of her old apartment, etc. Still, I tried to be supportive. We went out sometimes just to get her mind off stuff. Even when she saw her kids, I paid for everything—dinners, bowling, outings. I never asked for a dime.

Eventually, she got a job and promised to help with rent. She didn’t. Instead, she spent her first paycheck on a hotel with a guy, got her hair and nails done, and didn’t give me anything toward bills or the new iPhone I’d given her. I confronted her—not aggressively—just said I was overwhelmed and it didn’t feel fair. She flipped out, screamed, flipped my glass coffee table, and broke sentimental ornaments my grandmother gave me.

At that point, I’d had enough. I told her she had to leave. I was so upset I smashed the phone I gave her. (She still had her old phone, so she wasn’t without one.) I know that part wasn’t right, but I’d hit a breaking point.

The cops were called. I didn’t press charges. She left—and then made a Facebook post trashing me publicly. Some mutual friends sided with her, others didn’t say anything. I didn’t respond publicly because if they believed her, they were never really my friends to begin with.


A few months ago, I had a falling out with my (now former) friend “Karen.” Long story short, she lived with me rent-free for five months while I was going through cancer treatment and struggling financially. She didn’t help with bills like she promised, lied about applying for jobs, and constantly caused drama—especially whenever I started talking to someone new. It all escalated when she flipped a glass table and broke sentimental items after I asked her to pay me back for things she had promised to cover (like an iPhone I gave her). I told her to leave, and we haven’t spoken since.

Now to the current situation:

About two weeks ago, a man came into my new bartending job. He didn’t order anything—just sat down, stared at me for a bit while on the phone, and then left. A customer nearby said they overheard him saying, “Yeah, she works here.” I recognized him as one of Karen’s old flings. It made me really uncomfortable, especially since he had asked someone what time we closed.

Feeling uneasy, I made a vague Facebook post saying it was creepy and that I was worried someone was sent to check up on me. I never mentioned Karen’s name. But some mutual “friends” sent her screenshots, and she went off. She made a post directly naming me, calling me a liar and a bunch of other nasty things.

It didn’t stop there. She began calling my job repeatedly, claiming I was slandering her (again, I never used her name publicly). She told them I had issues with “Mexicans” and implied that’s who the guy was—odd, considering I hadn’t described him to anyone. My bosses already knew the situation and reviewed the security footage. Nothing I did warranted any kind of disciplinary action.

The calls and fake complaints kept coming. Strangers I didn’t know were calling my work to report made-up stuff about me. I found out Karen works at a bar just down the street from mine. After enduring this for a while, I called her boss to let them know she was harassing another local business. I didn’t demand she be fired—I just explained the situation.

A week later, she got fired. Turns out, she was already causing problems there too. I later heard she wasn’t just harassing me—others were getting threatening calls and even had their car keyed because of drama involving her.

Now she’s blaming me for her being fired and homeless, and some mutual acquaintances are saying I “went too far.”

So, AITA for standing up for myself and informing her employer about the harassment?",7,1750108558.0,AITAH,12,0.82,False

It........"," **CHAPTER ONE  The Ghost in the Computer**  
  Ten years ago, on my sixth birthday, my father disappeared.  No, he didn’t leave. Leaving would imply suitcases and empty drawers, and late birthday cards with ten-dollar bills stuffed inside. Leaving would imply he was unhappy with Mom and me, or that he found a new love elsewhere. None of that was true. He also did not die, because we would’ve heard about it. There was no car crash, no body, no police mingling about the scene of a brutal murder. It all happened very quietly.  
  On my sixth birthday, my father took me to the park, one of my favorite places to go at that time. It was a lonely little park in the middle of nowhere, with a running trail and a misty green pond surrounded by pine trees. We were at the edge of the pond, feeding the ducks, when I heard the jingle of an ice cream truck in the parking lot over the hill. When I begged my dad to get me a Creamsicle, he laughed, handed me a few bills, and sent me after the truck.  That was the last time I saw him.  Later, when the police searched the area, they discovered his shoes at the edge of the water, but nothing else. They sent divers into the pond, but it was barely ten feet down, and they found nothing but branches and mud at the bottom. My father had disappeared without a trace.  
  For months afterward, I had a recurring nightmare about standing at the top of that hill, looking down and seeing my father walk into the pond. As the water closed over his head, I could hear the ice cream truck singing in the background, a slow, eerie song with words I could almost understand. Every time I tried to listen to them, however, I’d wake up.  Not long after my father’s disappearance, Mom moved us far away, to a tiny little hick town in the middle of the Louisiana bayou. Mom said she wanted to “start over,” but I always knew, deep down, that she was running from something.  
  It would be another ten years before I discovered what.  MY NAME IS MEGHAN CHASE.  
  In less than twenty-four hours, I’ll be sixteen years old.  Sweet sixteen. It has a magical ring to it. Sixteen is supposed to be the age when girls become princesses and fall in love and go to dances and proms and such. Countless stories, songs, and poems have been written about this wonderful age, when a girl finds true love and the stars shine for her and the handsome prince carries her off into the sunset.  
  
  I didn’t think it would be that way for me.  
  
  The morning before my birthday, I woke up, showered, and rummaged through my dresser for something to wear. Normally, I’d just grab whatever clean-ish thing is on the floor, but today was special. Today was the day Scott Waldron would finally notice me. I wanted to look perfect. Of course, my wardrobe is sadly lacking in the popular-attire department. While other girls spend hours in front of their closets crying, “What should I wear?” my drawers basically hold three things: clothes from Goodwill, hand-me-downs, and overalls.  
  
  I wish we weren’t so poor. I know pig farming isn’t the most glamorous of jobs, but you’d think Mom could afford to buy me at least one pair of nice jeans. I glared at my scanty wardrobe in disgust. Oh, well, I guess Scott will have to be wowed with my natural grace and charm, if I don’t make an idiot of myself in front of him.  
  
  I finally slipped into cargo pants, a neutral green T-shirt, and my only pair of ratty sneakers, before dragging a brush through my white-blond hair. My hair is straight and very fine, and was doing that stupid floating thing again, where it looked like I’d jammed my finger up an electrical outlet. Yanking it into a ponytail, I went downstairs.  
  
  Luke, my stepfather, sat at the table, drinking coffee and leafing through the town’s tiny newspaper, which reads more like our high school gossip column than a real news source. “Five-legged calf born on Patterson’s farm,” the front page screamed; you get the idea. Ethan, my four-year-old half brother, sat on his father’s lap, eating a Pop-Tart and getting crumbs all over Luke’s overalls. He clutched Floppy, his favorite stuffed rabbit, in one arm and occasionally tried to feed it his breakfast; the rabbit’s face was full of crumbs and fruit filling.  
  
  Ethan is a good kid. He has his father’s curly brown hair, but like me, inherited Mom’s big blue eyes. He’s the type of kid old ladies stop to coo at, and total strangers smile and wave at him from across the street. Mom and Luke dote on their baby, but it doesn’t seem to spoil him, thank goodness.  
  
  “Where’s Mom?” I asked as I entered the kitchen. Opening the cabinet doors, I scoured the boxes of cereal for the one I liked, wondering if Mom remembered to pick it up. Of course she hadn’t. Nothing but fiber squares and disgusting marshmallow cereals for Ethan. Was it so hard to remember Cheerios?  
  
  Luke ignored me and sipped his coffee. Ethan chewed his Pop-Tart and sneezed on his father’s arm. I slammed the cabinet doors with a satisfying bang.  
  
  “Where’s Mom?” I asked, a bit louder this time. Luke jerked his head up and finally looked at me. His lazy brown eyes, like those of a cow, registered mild surprise.  
  
  “Oh, hello, Meg,” he said calmly. “I didn’t hear you come in. What did you say?”  
  
  I sighed and repeated my question for the third time.  
  
  “She had a meeting with some of the ladies at church,” Luke murmured, turning back to his paper. “She won’t be back for a few hours, so you’ll have to take the bus. ”  
  
  I always took the bus. I just wanted to remind Mom that she was supposed to take me to get a learner’s permit this weekend. With Luke, it was hopeless. I could tell him something fourteen different times, and he’d forget it the moment I left the room. It wasn’t that Luke was mean or malicious, or even stupid. He adored Ethan, and Mom seemed truly happy with him. But, every time I spoke to my stepdad, he would look at me with genuine surprise, as if he’d forgotten I lived here, too.  
  
  I grabbed a bagel from the top of the fridge and chewed it sullenly, keeping an eye on the clock. Beau, our German shepherd, wandered in and put his big head on my knee. I scratched him behind the ears and he groaned. At least the dog appreciated me.  
  
  Luke stood, gently placing Ethan back in his seat. “All right, big guy,” he said, kissing the top of Ethan’s head. “Dad has to fix the bathroom sink, so you sit there and be good. When I’m done, we’ll go feed the pigs, okay?”  
  
  “’Kay,” Ethan chirped, swinging his chubby legs. “Floppy wants to see if Ms. Daisy had her babies yet. ”  
  
  Luke’s smile was so disgustingly proud, I felt nauseous.  
  
  “Hey, Luke,” I said as he turned to go, “bet you can’t guess what tomorrow is. ”  
  
  “Mmm?” He didn’t even turn around. “I don’t know, Meg. If you have plans for tomorrow, talk to your mother. ” He snapped his fingers, and Beau immediately left me to follow him. Their footsteps faded up the stairs, and I was alone with my half brother.  
  
  Ethan kicked his feet, regarding me in that solemn way of his. “I know,” he announced softly, putting his Pop-Tart on the table. “Tomorrow’s your birthday, isn’t it? Floppy told me, and I remembered. ”  
  
  “Yeah,” I muttered, turning and lobbing the bagel into the trash can. It hit the wall with a thump and dropped inside, leaving a greasy smear on the paint. I smirked and decided to leave it.  
  
  “Floppy says to tell you happy early birthday. ”  
  
  “Tell Floppy thanks. ” I ruffled Ethan’s hair as I left the kitchen, my mood completely soured. I knew it. Mom and Luke would completely forget my birthday tomorrow. I wouldn’t get a card, or a cake, or even a “happy birthday” from anyone. Except my kid brother’s stupid stuffed rabbit. How pathetic was that?  
  
  Back in my room, I grabbed books, homework, gym clothes, and the iPod I’d spent a year saving for, despite Luke’s disdain of those “useles  
s, brain-numbing gadgets. ” In true hick fashion, my stepfather dislikes and distrusts anything that could make life easier. Cell phones? No way, we’ve got a perfectly good landline. Video games? They’re the devil’s tools, turning kids into delinquents and serial killers. I’ve begged Mom over and over to buy me a laptop for school, but Luke insists that if his ancient, clunky PC is good enough for him, it’s good enough for the family. Never mind that dial-up takes flipping forever. I mean, who uses dial-up anymore?  
  
  I checked my watch and swore. The bus would arrive shortly, and I had a good ten-minute walk to the main road. Looking out the window, I saw the sky was gray and heavy with rain, so I grabbed a jacket, as well. And, not for the first time, I wished we lived closer to town.  
  
  I swear, when I get a license and a car, I am never coming back to this place.  
  
  “Meggie?” Ethan hovered in the doorway, clutching his rabbit under his chin. His blue eyes regarded me somberly. “Can I go with you today?”  
  
  “What?” Shrugging into my jacket, I gazed around for my backpack. “No, Ethan. I’m going to school now. Big-kids school, no rug rats allowed. ”  
  
  I turned away, only to feel two small arms wrap around my leg. Putting my hand against the wall to avoid falling, I glared down at my half brother. Ethan clung to me doggedly, his face tilted up to mine, his jaw set. “Please?” he begged. “I’ll be good, I promise. Take me with you? Just for today?”  
  
  With a sigh, I bent down and picked him up.  
  
  “What’s up, squirt?” I asked, brushing his hair out of his eyes. Mom would need to cut it soon; it was starting to look like a bird’s nest. “You’re awfully clingy this morning. What’s going on?”  
  
  “Scared,” Ethan muttered, burying his face in my neck.  
  
  “You’re scared?”  
  
  He shook his head. “Floppy’s scared. ”  
  
  “What’s Floppy scared of?”  
  
  “The man in the closet. ”  
  
  I felt a small chill slide up my back. Sometimes, Ethan was so quiet and serious, it was hard to remember he was only four. He still had childish fears of monsters under his bed and bogeymen in his closet. In Ethan’s world, stuffed animals spoke to him, invisible men waved to him from the bushes, and scary creatures tapped long nails against his bedroom window. He rarely went to Mom or Luke with stories of monsters and bogeymen; from the time he was old enough to walk, he always came to me.  
  
  I sighed, knowing he wanted me to go upstairs and check, to reassure him that nothing lurked in his closet or under his bed. I kept a flashlight on his dresser for that very reason.  
  
  Outside, lightning flickered, and thunder rumbled in the distance. I winced. My walk to the bus was not going to be pleasant.  
  
  Dammit, I don’t have time for this.  
  
  Ethan pulled back and looked at me, eyes pleading. I sighed again. “Fine,” I muttered, putting him down. “Let’s go check for monsters. ”  
  
  He followed me silently up the stairs, watching anxiously as I grabbed the flashlight and got down on my knees, shining it under the bed. “No monsters there,” I announced, standing up. I walked to the closet door and flung it open as Ethan peeked out from behind my legs. “No monsters here, either. Think you’ll be all right now?”  
  
  He nodded and gave me a faint smile. I started to close the door when I noticed a strange gray hat in the corner. It was domed on top, with a circular rim and a red band around the base: a bowler hat.  
  
  Weird. Why would that be there?  
  
  As I straightened and started to turn around, something moved out of the corner of my eye. I caught a glimpse of a figure hiding behind Ethan’s bedroom door, its pale eyes watching me through the crack. I jerked my head around, but of course there was nothing there.  
  
  Jeez, now Ethan’s got me seeing imaginary monsters. I need to stop watching those late-night horror flicks.  
  
  A thunderous boom directly overhead made me jump, and fat drops plinked against the windowpanes. Rushing past Ethan, I burst out of the house and sprinted down the driveway.  
  
  I WAS SOAKED WHEN I REACHED the bus stop. The late spring rain wasn’t frigid, but it was cold enough to be uncomfortable. I crossed my arms and huddled under a mossy cypress, waiting for the bus to arrive.  
  
  Wonder where Robbie is? I mused, gazing down the road. He’s usually here by now. Maybe he didn’t feel like getting drenched and stayed home. I snorted and rolled my eyes. Skipping class again, huh? Slacker. Wish I could do that.  
  
  If only I had a car. I knew kids whose parents gave them cars for their sixteenth birthday. Me, I’d be lucky if I got a cake. Most of my classmates already had licenses and could drive themselves to clubs and parties and anywhere they wanted. I was always left behind, the backward hick girl nobody wanted to invite.  
  
  Except Robbie, I amended with a small mental shrug. At least Robbie will remember. Wonder what kooky thing he has planned for my birthday tomorrow? I could almost guarantee it would be something strange or crazy. Last year, he snuck me out of the house for a midnight picnic in the woods. It was weird; I remembered the glen and the little pond with the fireflies drifting over it, but though I explored the woods behind my house countless times since then, I never found it again.  
  
  Something rustled in the bushes behind me. A possum or a deer, or even a fox, seeking shelter from the rain. The wildlife out here was stupidly bold and had little fear of humans. If it wasn’t for Beau, Mom’s vegetable garden would be a buffet for rabbits and deer, and the local raccoon family would help themselves to everything in our cupboards.  
  
  A branch snapped in the trees, closer this time. I shifted uncomfortably, determined not to turn around for some stupid squirrel or raccoon. I’m not like “inflate-a-boob” Angie, Ms. Perfect Cheerleader, who’d flip out if she saw a caged gerbil or a speck of dirt on her Hollister jeans. I’ve pitched hay and killed rats and driven pigs through knee-deep mud. Wild animals don’t scare me.

Still, I stared down the road, hoping to see the bus turn the corner. Maybe it was the rain and my own sick imagination, but the woods felt like the set for The Blair Witch Project.  
  
  There are no wolves or serial killers out here, I told myself. Stop being paranoid.  
  
  The forest was suddenly very quiet. I leaned against the tree and shivered, trying to will the bus into appearing. A chill crawled up my back. I wasn’t alone. Cautiously, I craned my neck up, peering through the leaves. An enormous black bird perched on a branch, feathers spiked out against the rain, sitting as motionless as a statue. As I watched, it turned its head and met my gaze, with eyes as green as colored glass.  
  
  And then, something reached around the tree and grabbed me.  
  
  I screamed and leaped away, my heart hammering in my ears. Whirling around, I tensed to run, my mind filled with rapists and murderers and Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  
  
  Laughter exploded behind me.  
  
  Robbie Goodfell, my closest neighbor—meaning he lived nearly two miles away—slouched against the tree trunk, gasping with mirth. Lanky and tall, in tattered jeans and an old T-shirt, he paused to look at my pale face, before cracking up again. His spiky red hair lay plastered to his forehead and his clothes clung to his skin, emphasizing his lean, bony frame, as though his limbs didn’t fit quite right. Being drenched and covered in twigs, leaves, and mud didn’t seem to bother him. Few things did.  
  
  “Dammit, Robbie!” I raged, stomping up and aiming a kick at him. He dodged and staggered into the road, his face red from laughter. “That wasn’t funny, you idiot. You nearly gave me a heart attack. ”  
  
  “S-sorry, princess,” Robbie gasped, clutching his heart as he sucked in air. “It was just too perfect. ” He gave a final chortle and straightened, holding his ribs. “Man, that was impressive. You must’ve jumped three feet in the air. What, did you think I was, Leatherface or something?”  
  
  “Of course not, stupid. ” I turned away with a huff to hide my burning face. “And I told you to stop calling me that! I’m not ten anymore. ”  
  
  “Sure thing, princess. ”  
  
  I rolled my eyes. “Has anyone told you you have the maturity level of a four-year-old?”  
  
  He laughed cheerfully. “Look who’s talking. I’m not the one who stayed up all night with the lights on after watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I tried to warn you. ” He made a grotesque face and staggered toward me, arms outstretched. “Ooooh, look out, it’s Leatherface. ”  
  
  I scowled and kicked water at him. He kicked some back, laughing. By the time the bus showed up a few minutes later, we were both covered in mud, dripping wet, and the bus driver told us to sit in the back.  
  
  “What are you doing after school?” Robbie asked as we huddled in the far backseat. Around us, students talked, joked, laughed, and generally paid us no attention. “Wanna grab a coffee later? Or we could sneak into the theater and see a movie. ”  
  
  “Not today, Rob,” I replied, trying to wring water from my shirt. Now that it was over, I dearly regretted our little mud battle. I was going to look like the Creature from the Black Lagoon in front of Scott. “You’ll have to do your sneaking without me this time. I’m tutoring someone after class. ”  
  
  Robbie’s green eyes narrowed. “Tutoring someone? Who?”  
  
  My stomach fluttered, and I tried not to grin. “Scott Waldron. ”  
  
  “What?” Robbie’s lip curled in a grimace of disgust. “The jockstrap? Why, does he need you to teach him how to read?”  
  
  I scowled at him. “Just because he’s captain of the football team doesn’t mean you can be a jerk. Or are you jealous?”  
  
  “Oh, of course, that’s it,” Robbie said with a sneer. “I’ve always wanted the IQ of a rock. No, wait. That would be an insult to the rock. ” He snorted. “I can’t believe you’re going for the jockstrap. You can do so much better, princess. ”  
  
  “Don’t call me that. ” I turned away to hide my burning face. “And it’s just a tutoring session. He’s not going to ask me to the prom. Jeez. ”  
  
  “Right. ” Robbie sounded unconvinced. “He’s not, but you’re hoping he will. Admit it. You’re drooling over him just like every empty-headed cheerleader on campus. ”  
  
  “So what if I am?” I snapped, spinning around. “It’s none of your business, Rob. What do you care, anyway?”  
  
  He got very quiet, muttering something unintelligible under his breath. I turned my back on him and stared out the window. I didn’t care what Robbie said. This afternoon, for one glorious hour, Scott Waldron would be mine alone, and no one would distract me from that.  
  
  SCHOOL DRAGGED. THE TEACHERS all spoke gibberish, and the clocks seemed to be moving backward. The afternoon crept by in a daze. Finally, finally, the last bell rang, freeing me from the endless torture of X equals Y problems.  
  
  Today is the day, I told myself as I maneuvered the crowded hallways, keeping to the edge of the teeming mass. Wet sneakers squeaked over tile, and a miasma of sweat, smoke, and body odor hung thick in the air. Nervousness fluttered inside me. You can do this. Don’t think about it. Just go in and get it over with.  
  
  Dodging students, I wove my way down the hall and peeked into the computer room.  
  
  There he was, sitting at one of the desks with both feet up on another chair. Scott Waldron, captain of the football team. Gorgeous Scott. King-of-the-school Scott. He wore a red-and-white letterman jacket that showed off his broad chest, and his thick dark blond hair brushed the top of his collar.  
  
  My heart pounded. A whole hour in the same room with Scott Waldron, with no one to get in the way. Normally, I couldn’t even get close to Scott; he was either surrounded by Angie and her cheerleader groupies, or his football buddies. There were other students in the computer lab with us, but they were nerds and academic types, beneath Scott Waldron’s notice. The jocks and cheerleaders wouldn’t be caught dead in here if they could help it. I took a deep breath and stepped into the room.  
  
  He didn’t glance at me when I walked up beside him. He lounged in the chair with his feet up and his head back, tossing an invisible ball across the room. I cleared my throat. Nothing. I cleared it a little louder. Still nothing.  
  
  Gathering my courage, I stepped in front of him and waved. His coffee-brown eyes finally jerked up to mine. For a moment, he looked startled. Then an eyebrow rose in a lazy arc, as if he couldn’t figure out why I wanted to talk to him.  
  
  Uh-oh. Say something, Meg. Something intelligent.  
  
  “Um…” I stammered. “Hi. I’m Meghan. I sit behind you. In computer class. ” He was still giving me that blank stare, and I felt my cheeks getting hot. “Uh…I really don’t watch a lot of sports, but I think you’re an awesome quarterback, not that I’ve seen many—well, just you, actually. But you really seem to know what you’re doing. I go to all your games, you know. I’m usually in the very back, so you probably don’t see me. ” Oh, God. Shut up, Meg. Shut up now. I clamped my mouth closed to stop the incessant babbling, wanting to crawl into a hole and die. What was I thinking, agreeing to this? Better to be invisible than to look like a complete and total moron, especially in front of Scott.  
  
  He blinked lazily, reached up, and pulled the earphones from his ears. “Sorry, babe,” he drawled in that wonderful, deep voice of his. “I couldn’t hear you. ” He gave me a once-over and smirked. “Are you supposed to be the tutor?”  
  
  “Um, yes. ” I straightened and smoothed out my remaining shreds of dignity. “I’m Meghan. Mr. Sanders asked me to help you out with your programming project. ”  
  
  He continued to smirk at me. “Aren’t you that hick girl who lives out in the swamp? Do you even know what a computer is?”  
  
  My face flamed, and my stomach contracted into a tight little ball. Okay, so I didn’t have a great computer at home. That was why I spent most of my after-school time here, in the lab, doing homework or just surfing online. In fact, I was hoping to make it into ITT Tech in a couple  
of years. Programming and Web design came easily to me. I knew how to work a computer, dammit.  
  
  But, in the face of Scott’s criticism, I could only stammer: “Y-yes, I do. I mean, I know a lot. ” He gave me a dubious look, and I felt the sting of wounded pride. I had to prove to him that I wasn’t the backward hillbilly he thought I was. “Here, I’ll show you,” I offered, and reached toward the keyboard on the table.  Then something weird happened.  I hadn’t even touched the keys when the computer screen blipped on. When I paused, my fingers hovering over the board, words began to scroll across the blue screen.

I ended up at the ER for fluids with an eGFR in single digits because of the dehydration.  
  
Since then my eGFR has not returned to normal. The highest it has got since then is 58. I take testosterone because I am very deficient. This can raise creatinine levels so I asked my doctor for the cystatin C test. They said that was a good idea so we did that test. My eGFR came back from that test at 50. My cystatin C levels were elevated at 1.42.  
  
My doctor referred me to a nephrologist for a long term plan. I spoke with the nephrologist office today and they do not have any appointments until December which is 6 months away.  
  
My doctor did not give me any recommendations, probably thinking the nephrologist could see me sooner. I checked the sidebar of the subreddit and it doesn’t have any useful resources linked like many subreddits do.  
  
How worried should I be? What can I do between now and the nephrologist appointment? I like to smoke weed and drink alcohol. I see that smoking weed isn’t a good idea. I exercise regularly and do yoga. My diet consists of a lot of salads and fish. I do like garbage food too but don’t eat it anywhere near as much. I do not drink sugary drinks, mostly water. I have one cup of coffee a day.

The relationship is quite fresh (3-4 month) but we've been friends for some time (2 Years )before. So far it's a very loving and respectful relationship. I haven't felt this kind of love since 10 years. The honeymoon phase felt amazing.
Now, that the relationship is more intimate, I get to know her more. And now there has been situations that make me question if she has BPD.
Where she suddenly got really upset and angry and accusing me of not taking responsibility, while I'm doing my best to inform her when I need time for myself and still be there and be in contact and taking care of the relationship.

And I want to know how to handle it, because I don't want to start assumptions and start observing her behaviours and judge or to behave in a way that's not respectful. And I want to see my own part of the dynamic.

Anyway: the latest situation happened this morning, she was staying at my place and we had a really connected and intimate evening. Really loving.
We agreed in the evening that she can stay, but will have to leave early, so I can start my day my way.

And in the morning she asked if she can drink a coffee and little breakfast before leaving, I agreed. But I got nervous because I felt my social battery is down and I really need time for myself asap.
So I told her I realise that I feel getting nervous and want to start my day and so I left the table to take care about my needs. I just wanted her to finish her coffee in her own time and say goodbye to me soon (like we agreed).

And then she snapped, getting her stuff and accusing me of getting so sudden out of contact and beeing crule and aggressive and said it felt like I was very violent with my behaviour.
For me it came totally surprising and I was really down with my energy, so I told her, I had no intention of pushing her out or beeng aggressive,that I didn't say she did something wrong, I just said I feel I'm getting nervous.
When she started to make a fight, I says stop and wanted to postpone the argument, but as she went more aggressive, I put my boundaries and made her leave. (So yes, in the end I threw her out - like a self fulfilling prophecy of her)

For her it was so overwhelming that she cancelled all our plans for the upcoming days, and was reaaally angry and  she said a part of her wanted to end the relationships, but she won't do because she wants to work on ourselves.

I see that I am not yet able to communicate soon enough when my social battery is empty, that's on me.
But I am so confused of her sudden snapping and overreacting (my point of view).

It might be just a dynamic of our nervous system that's triggering each other.. but it might be BPD (I know she was abandon as a baby a lot and had a childhood where she had to to function and had no space to be a child. I know she can switch into a mindset of a 2 year old, when overwhelmed or left alone)

I know it's hard to analyse from just those infos, but I'm getting scared that I get into the trap of working on myself to be a better partner and make her feel save, when she might be borderlining and eventually manipulating me to not deal with her bpd behaviour (if thats the case).

I will work on my skills to feel my social battery and boundaries sooner and bring them into contact, I know that's my struggle and I am already so much better in this than ever before.

I'm not sure if i should stay my ground or take more responsibility for the situation..

How can I handle this situation better?

I have been brewing a couple years on a makeshift BIAB system. The last couple years I have made a beer for Deer Camp every November (it’s typically about 40 degrees Fahrenheit around then), but it’s typically just been whatever I feel like doing. The first year was a coffee porter, and the second year I made a mocktoberfest. I wanted to make a specific beer every year and hopefully refine it over time, but I needed a goal. After asking the guys, the responses were as follows:

“I’m partial to ales. Saisons, IPAs, and Irish Reds are delightful”

“You know me ambers and Octoberfest are my favorite”

“That time of year the Octoberfest/Winter Ale profiles… caramels/malty/cream/mildly sweet? I don’t know if that’s a profile or not, but best I can describe. :)”

1ld4sc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/lithuania/comments/1ld4sc5/questions_about_living_in_lithuania_as_a_foreigner/,Questions About Living in Lithuania as a foreigner?,"My parents came to Canada in search of building a better life for themselves after socialism fell in their home countries (Romania and Yugoslavia), but life here has been getting so expensive that I plan on leaving once I’m done school in about a year. I am considering Lithuania as a place to move to as I adore the nature and the beautiful culture of the country, from what I’ve heard it’s also a very affordable place to live, and I’ve always wanted to live in a northern country due to my preference for colder weather. There are just a few questions I have right now while I’m considering it:

1. Since I want to leave as soon as possible after finishing school, I only have about a year to study the language. I obviously understand that this is nowhere near enough time to become proficient in the language, so how much of a struggle will that be if my Lithuanian is not very strong (obviously I’d work on it after as well)?

2. What are the best cities to live in? Despite the fact that I love nature I am totally a city person. One thing I love about where I visit in the places where my parents came from is that people tend to take life a little slower and will often go out with friends for coffee in the mornings before going about their day or even going to work and I’d like to know if there’s any cities where life is like this (I’m not too big on nightlife, but I would like to know what nightlife is like in these cities)?

3. What are things like for transgender people there? I’m trans myself but I haven’t been able to transition as I’ve always been in a place where it isn’t safe to do so, since I probably won’t have transitioned by the time I’d move I want to know what I can expect the general attitude towards trans people to be (I looked a bit on google and it said it’s pretty good, but I’d also like input from people living there, too)?

4. Orthodox churches. Despite what I had said in my previous question, I am a practicing orthodox Christian and I’m wondering if there’s a good amount of Orthodox church’s (since it’s a predominantly Catholic country)?

Edit: Catholic, not Protestant.

I lost it either on the morning of June 16 at Lawson’s Landing camping site or at Coffee&Tea Co. in Petaluma.

That camera holds all my memories from this trip — sunsets, friends, firsts. When I realized it was gone, I broke down. I canceled the road trip I’d been dreaming about and ended up crying for an hour at the Davis train station, not knowing what to do.

Even just getting back the memory card would mean the world to me. No questions asked — I just want my memories.

The curtains were too Little House on the Prairie with the color scheme of a bad ......","My father is a control freak, I hate my stepmother, my brother is dead and my mother has … well … issues. How do you think I’m doing?”  That’s how I would have loved to respond to Mrs. Collins’s question, but my father placed too much importance on appearance for me to answer honestly. Instead, I blinked three times and said, “Fine. ”  Mrs. Collins, Eastwick High’s new clinical social worker, acted as if I hadn’t spoken. She shoved a stack of files to the side of her already cluttered desk and flipped through various papers. My new therapist hummed when she found my three-inch-thick file and rewarded herself with a sip of coffee, leaving bright red lipstick on the curve of the mug. The stench of cheap coffee and freshly sharpened pencils hung in the air.  My father checked his watch from the chair to my right and, on my left, the Wicked Witch of the West shifted impatiently. I was missing first period calculus, my father was missing some very important meeting, and my stepmother from Oz? I’m sure she was missing her brain.  “Don’t you just love January?” Mrs. Collins asked as she opened my file. “New year, new month, new slate to start over on. ” Not even waiting for a reply, she continued, “Do you like the curtains? I made them myself. ”  In one synchronized movement, my father, my stepmother and I turned our attention to the pink polka-dotted curtains hanging on the windows overlooking the student parking lot. The curtains were too Little House on the Prairie with the color scheme of a bad rave for my taste. Not a single one of us answered and our silence created a heavy awkwardness.  My father’s BlackBerry vibrated. With exaggerated effort, he pulled it out of his pocket and scrolled down the screen. Ashley drummed her fingers over her bloated belly and I read the various handpainted plaques hanging on the wall so I could focus on anything that wasn’t her.  Failure is your only enemy. The only way up is to never look down. We succeed because we believe. How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?  Okay—so that last one didn’t make the wall of sayings, but I would have found it amusing.  Mrs. Collins reminded me of an overgrown Labrador retriever with her blond hair and much too friendly attitude. “Echo’s ACT and SAT scores are fabulous. You should be very proud of your daughter. ” She gave me a sincere smile, exposing all of her teeth.  Start the timer. My therapy session had officially begun. Close to two years ago, after the incident, Child Protective Services had “strongly encouraged” therapy—and Dad quickly learned that it was better to say yes to anything “strongly encouraged. ” I used to go to therapy like normal people, at an office separate from school. Thanks to an influx in funding from the state of Kentucky and an overenthusiastic social worker, I’d become part of this pilot program. Mrs. Collins’s sole job was to deal with a few kids from my high school. Lucky me.  
  
  My father sat up taller in his seat. “Her math scores were low. I want her to retake the tests. ”  
  
  “Is there a bathroom nearby?” Ashley interrupted. “The baby loves to sit on my bladder. ”  
  
  More like Ashley loved to make everything about her. Mrs. Collins gave her a strained smile and pointed to the door. “Go out to the main hallway and take a right. ”  
  
  The way she maneuvered out of her chair, Ashley acted as if she carried a thousand-pound ball of lead instead of a tiny baby. I shook my head in disgust, which only drew my father’s ice-cold stare.  
  
  “Mr. Emerson,” Mrs. Collins continued once Ashley left the room, “Echo’s scores are well above the national average and, according to her file, she’s already applied to the colleges of her choice. ”  
  
  “There are some business schools with extended deadlines I’d like her to apply to. Besides, this family does not accept ‘above average. ’ My daughter will excel. ” My father spoke with the air of a deity. He might as well have added the phrase so let it be written, so let it be done. I propped my elbow on the armrest and hid my face in my hands.  
  
  “I can see that this really bothers you, Mr. Emerson,” Mrs. Collins said in an annoyingly even tone. “But Echo’s English scores are close to perfect…. ”  
  
  And this was where I tuned them out. My father and the previous guidance counselor had this fight my sophomore year when I took the PSAT. Then again last year when I took the SAT and ACT for the first time. Eventually, the guidance counselor learned my father always won and started giving up after one round.  
  
  My test scores were the least of my concerns. Finding the money to fix Aires’ car was the worry that plagued my brain. Since Aires’ death, my father had remained stubborn on the subject, insisting we should sell it.  
  
  “Echo, are you happy with your scores?” asked Mrs. Collins.  
  
  I peeked at her through the red, curly hair hanging over my face. The last therapist understood the hierarchy of our family and talked to my father, not me. “Excuse me?”  
  
  “Are you happy with your ACT and SAT scores? Do you want to retake the tests?” She folded her hands and placed them on top of my file. “Do you want to apply to more schools?”  
  
  I met my father’s tired gray eyes. Let’s see. Retaking the tests would mean my father hounding me every second to study, which in turn would mean me getting up early on a Saturday, blowing the whole morning frying my brain and then worrying for weeks over the results. As for applying to more schools? I’d rather retake the tests. “Not really. ”  
  
  The worry lines forever etched around his eyes and mouth deepened with disapproval. I changed my tune. “My dad is right. I should retake the tests. ”  
  
  Mrs. Collins scratched away in my file with a pen. My last therapist had been highly aware of my authority issues. No need to rewrite what was already there.  
  
  Ashley waddled back into the room and dropped into the seat next to me. “What did I miss?” I’d honestly forgotten she existed. Oh, if only Dad would, too.  
  
  “Nothing,” my father replied.  
  
  Mrs. Collins finally lifted her pen from the page. “Ask Mrs. Marcos for the next testing dates before you go to class. And while I’m playing the role of guidance counselor, I’d like to discuss your schedule for the winter term. You’ve filled your free periods with multiple business classes. I was wondering why. ”  
  
  The real answer, because my father told me to, would probably irritate multiple people in the room so I ad-libbed, “They’ll help prepare me for college. ” Wow. I’d said that with all the enthusiasm of a six-year-old waiting for a flu shot. Bad choice on my part. My father shifted in his seat again and sighed. I considered giving a different answer, but figured that reply would also come off flat.  
  
  Mrs. Collins perused my file. “You’ve shown an incredible talent in the arts, specifically painting. I’m not suggesting you drop all of your business courses, but you could drop one and take an art class instead. ”  
  
  “No,” my father barked. He leaned forward in his seat, steepling his fingers. “Echo won’t be taking any art classes, is that clear?” My father was a strange combination of drill instructor and Alice’s white rabbit: he always had someplace important to go and enjoyed bossing everyone else around.  
  
  I had to give Mrs. Collins credit; she never once flinched before she caved. “Crystal. ”  
  
  “Well, now that we’ve settled that …” Ashley and her baby bump perched on the edge of the chair, preparing to stand. “I accidentally overbooked today and I have an OB appointment. We may find out the baby’s gender. ”  
  
  “Mrs. Emerson, Echo’s academics aren’t the reason for this meeting, but I understand if you need to leave. ” She withdrew an official letter from her top drawer as a red-faced Ashley sat back in her seat. I’d seen that letterhead several times ov  
er the past two years. Child Protective Services enjoyed killing rainforests.  
  
  Mrs. Collins read the letter to herself while I secretly wished I would spontaneously combust. Both my father and I slouched in our seats. Oh, the freaking joy of group therapy.  
  
  While waiting for her to finish reading, I noticed a stuffed green frog by her computer, a picture of her and some guy— possibly her husband—and then on the corner of her desk a big blue ribbon. The fancy kind people received when they won a competition. Something strange stirred inside me. Huh—weird.  
  
  Mrs. Collins hole-punched the letter and then placed it in my already overwhelmed file. “There. I’m officially your therapist. ”  
  
  When she said nothing else, I drew my gaze away from the ribbon to her. She was watching me. “It’s a nice ribbon, isn’t it, Echo?”  
  
  My father cleared his throat and sent Mrs. Collins a death glare. Okay, that was an odd reaction, but then again, he was irritated just to be here. My eyes flickered to the ribbon again. Why did it feel familiar? “I guess. ”  
  
  Her eyes drifted to the dog tags I absently fingered around my neck. “I’m very sorry for your family’s loss. What branch of the armed forces?”  
  
  Great. My father was going to have a stinking coronary. He’d only made it clear seventy-five times that Aires’ dog tags were to stay in the box under my bed, but I needed them today—new therapist, the two-year anniversary of Aires’ death still fresh, and the first day of my last semester of high school. Nausea skipped and played in my intestines. Avoiding my father’s disappointed frown, I took great pains to search my hair for split ends.  
  
  “Marine,” my father answered curtly. “Look, I’ve got a meeting this morning with prospective clients, I promised Ashley I’d go to her doctor’s appointment and Echo’s missing class. When are we going to wrap this up?”  
  
  “When I say so. If you’re going to make these sessions difficult, Mr. Emerson, I will be more than happy to call Echo’s social worker. ”  
  
  I fought the smile tugging at my lips. Mrs. Collins played a well-choreographed hand. My father backed down, but my stepmother on the other hand …  
  
  “I don’t understand. Echo turns eighteen soon. Why does the state still have authority over her?”  
  
  “Because it’s what the state, her social worker and myself think is in her best interest. ” Mrs. Collins closed my file. “Echo will continue therapy with me until she graduates this spring. At that point, the state of Kentucky will release her—and you. ”  
  
  She waited until Ashley nodded her silent acceptance of the situation before continuing. “How are you doing, Echo?”  
  
  Splendid. Fantastic. Never worse. “Fine. ”  
  
  “Really?” She tapped a finger against her chin. “Because I would have thought that the anniversary of your brother’s death might trigger painful emotions. ”  
  
  Mrs. Collins eyed me while I stared blankly in return. My father and Ashley watched the uncomfortable showdown. Guilt nagged at me. She didn’t technically ask me a question, so in theory, I didn’t owe her a response, but the need to please her swept over me like a tidal wave. But why? She was another therapist in the revolving door. They all asked the same questions and promised help, but each of them left me in the same condition as they found me—broken. She cries. ” Ashley’s high-pitched voice cut through the silence as if she were dispensing juicy country-club gossip. “All the time. She really misses Aires. ”  
  
  Both my father and I turned our heads to look at the blond bimbo. I willed her to continue while my father, I’m sure, willed her to shut up. God listened to me for once. Ashley went on, “We all miss him. It’s so sad that the baby will never know him. ”  
  
  And once again, welcome to the Ashley show, sponsored by Ashley and my father’s money. Mrs. Collins wrote briskly, no doubt etching each of Ashley’s unguarded words into my file while my father groaned.  
  
  “Echo, would you like to talk about Aires during today’s session?” Mrs. Collins asked.  
  
  “No. ” That was possibly the most honest answer I’d given all morning.  
  
  “That’s fine,” she said. “We’ll save him for a later date. What about your mother? Have you had any contact with her?”  
  
  Ashley and my father answered simultaneously, “No,” while I blurted, “Kind of. ”  
  
  I felt like the middle of a ham sandwich the way the two of them leaned toward me. I wasn’t sure what prompted me to tell the truth. “I tried calling her over break. ” When she didn’t answer, I’d sat next to the phone for days, hoping and praying my mother would care that two years before, my brother, her son, had died.  
  
  My father ran a hand over his face. “You know you’re not allowed to have contact with your mother. ” The anger in his voice hinted that he couldn’t believe I’d told the therapist this tantalizing tidbit. I imagined visions of social workers dancing in his head. “There is a restraining order. Tell me, Echo, landline or cell phone?”  
  
  “Landline,” I choked out. “But we never talked. I swear. ”  
  
  He swiped at his BlackBerry and his lawyer’s number appeared on the screen. I clutched the dog tags, Aires’ name and serial number embedding in my palm. “Please, Daddy, don’t,” I whispered.  
  
  He hesitated and my heart pressed against my rib cage. Then, by the grace of God, he dropped the phone to his lap. “We’re going to have to change the number now. ”  
  
  I nodded. It stunk that my mom would never be able to call my home, but I’d take the hit … for her. Of all the things my mother needed, prison wasn’t one of them.  
  
  “Have you had contact with your mother since then?” Mrs. Collins lost her friendliness.  
  
  “No. ” I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Everything inside of me ached. I couldn’t keep up the “I’m fine” facade much longer. This line of questioning ripped at my soul’s freshly scabbed wounds.  
  
  “To confirm we’re on the same page, you understand that contact between you and your mother while there is a restraining order, even if you initiate it, is forbidden. ”  
  
  “Yes. ” I took another gulp of air. The lump in my throat denied the entry of the precious oxygen. I missed Aires and, God, my mom, and Ashley was having a baby, and my dad was on me all the time, and … I needed something, anything.  
  
  Against my better judgment, I let the words tumble out of my mouth. “I want to fix Aires’ car. ” Maybe, just maybe, restoring something of his would make the pain go away.  
  
  “Oh, not this again,” my father muttered.  
  
  “Wait. Not what again? Echo, what are you talking about?” asked Mrs. Collins.  
  
  I stared at the gloves on my hands. “Aires found a 1965 Corvette in a scrap yard. He spent all of his free time fixing it up and he was almost done before he went to Afghanistan. I want to restore it. For Aires. ” For me. He didn’t leave anything behind when he left, except the car.  
  
  “That sounds like a healthy way to grieve. What are your thoughts on this, Mr. Emerson?” Mrs. Collins gave great puppy dog eyes—a trait I had yet to master.  
  
  My father scrolled again through his BlackBerry, his body present but his mind already at work. “It costs money and I don’t see the point in fixing up a broken-down car when she has a car that works. ”  
  
  “Then let me get a job,” I snapped. “And we can sell my car once I get Aires’ working. ”  
  
  All eyes were on him and now his were on me. Without meaning to, I’d backed him into a corner. He wanted to say no, but that would bring down the wrath of the new therapist. After all, we had to be perfect in therapy. God forbid we take advantage of it and hash out some issues.  
  
  “Fine, but she has to pay for the car herself, and Echo knows my rules regarding employment. She has to find a flexible job that will not interfere with her schoolwork, the clubs we agreed upon or her grades. Now, are we done here?”  
  
  Mrs. Collins glanced at the clock. “Not quite. Echo, your social worker extended your therapy until graduation because of your teacher evaluations. Since the beginning of your junior year, each of your teachers has noted a distinct withdrawal from your participation in class and in your social interactions with your peers. ” Her kind eyes bored into mine. “Everyone wants you to be happy, Echo, and I’d like you to give me the opportunity to help. ”  
  
  I cocked an eyebrow. Like I had a choice about therapy, and as for my happiness—good freaking luck. “Sure. ”  
  
  Ashley’s perky voice startled me. “She has a date for the Valentine’s Dance. ”  
  
  Now my father and I took our turn speaking simultaneously. “I do?”—”She does?”  
  
  Ashley’s eyes darted nervously between me and my father. “Yes, remember, Echo? Last night we discussed the new guy you’re into and I told you that you shouldn’t dump your friends at school while you obsessed over some guy. ”  
  
  I deliberated over which part disturbed me more: the imaginary boyfriend or that she claimed we’d had an actual conversation. While I was deciding, my father stood and put on his coat. “See, Mrs. Collins, Echo is fine. Just a little lovestruck. As much as I enjoy these sessions, Ashley’s appointment is in twenty minutes and I don’t want Echo to miss any more class. ”  
  
  “Echo, are you really interested in making money to fix your brother’s car?” Mrs. Collins asked as she stood to escort my father and stepmother out.  
  
  I pulled at the gloves I wore to cover my skin. “More than you could possibly imagine. ”  
  
  She smiled at me before walking out the door. “Then I’ve got a job for you. Wait here and we’ll discuss the details. ”  
  
  The three of them huddled together on the far side of the main office, whispering to one another. My father wrapped his arm around Ashley’s waist and she leaned into him as they nodded at Mrs. Collins’s hushed words. The familiar pang of jealousy and anger ate at the lining of my gut. How could he love her when she’d destroyed so much?  NOAH  
  
  Fresh paint and the scent of drywall dust made me think of my father, not school. Yet that smell slapped me in the face when I walked into the newly remodeled front office. With books in hand, I sauntered toward the counter. “‘Sup, Mrs. Marcos. ”  
  
  “Noah, why you late again, muchacho?” she said while stapling papers together.  
  
  The clock on the wall flipped to nine in the morning. “Hell, this is early. ”  
  
  Mrs. Marcos stepped around her new cherry desk to meet me at the counter. She gave me crap when I came in late, but I still liked her. With her long brown hair, she reminded me of a Hispanic version of my mother.  
  
  “You missed your appointment with Mrs. Collins this morning. Not a good way to start the second term,” she whispered as she wrote my tardy slip. She tilted her head toward the three adults huddled together in the far corner of the room. I assumed the middle-aged blond woman whispering to the rich couple was the new guidance counselor.  
  
  I shrugged and let the right side of my mouth twitch up. “Oops. ”  
  
  Mrs. Marcos slid the tardy slip to me and gave me her patented stern glare. She was the one person at this school who didn’t believe that me and my future were completely fucked.  
  
  The middle-aged blonde called out, “Mr. Hutchins, I’m thrilled you remembered our appointment, even if you are late. I’m sure you wouldn’t mind taking a  
seat while I finish a few things. ” She smiled at me like we were old friends and spoke so sweetly that for a moment, I almost smiled back. Instead, I nodded and took a seat on the line of chairs pushed against the office wall.  
  
  Mrs. Marcos laughed.  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “She’s not going to put up with your attitude. Maybe she’ll convince you to take school seriously. ”  
  
  I rested my head against the painted cinder-block wall and shut my eyes, in need of a few more hours’ sleep. Short one person for closing, the restaurant hadn’t let me go until after midnight, and then Beth and Isaiah kept me up.  
  
  “Mrs. Marcos?” asked an angelic voice. “Can you please tell me the upcoming dates for the ACT and SAT? The phone rang. “Wait one sec,” said Mrs. Marcos. Then the ringing ceased.  
  
  A chair down the row from mine shifted and my mouth watered from the aroma of hot cinnamon rolls. I snuck a peek and noticed red, silky, curly hair. I knew her. Echo Emerson.  
  
  Not a cinnamon roll in sight, but damn if she didn’t smell like one. We had several of our main courses together and last semester one of our free periods. I didn’t know much about her other than she kept to herself, she was smart, a redhead and she had big tits. She wore large, long-sleeved shirts that hung off her shoulders and tank tops underneath that revealed just enough to get the fantasies flowing.  
  
  Like always, she stared straight ahead as if I didn’t exist. Hell, I probably didn’t exist in her mind. People like Echo Emerson irritated the crap out of me.  
  
  “You’ve got a fucked-up name,” I mumbled. I didn’t know why I wanted to rattle her, I just did....

Here’s some background. She first became a partner last year at store A, where I was working. It was a high volume store, so training there is pretty hard and a lot of people didn’t like her because she was slow. I gave her the benefit of the doubt because she’s new. However, she kept saying how she’d become a coffee master within 6 months, as well as being a shift leader like her girlfriend, who also worked at store A.

Couple months later she transferred to store B. And then a couple months after that, I transferred there too. It seems like she didn’t like me… and I know she doesn’t because every time she picks up a shift back at store A she talks some sort of shit about me. She recently said that my cleanplay was bad, even though she was the closer the following day. I actually worked in the morning and asked the openers how it was. They said it was good, the only thing was the ovens but because I didn’t have oven spray I wasn’t able to clean them. They told me it was fine. How are you going to talk bad about my cleanplay and saying I should know better because I was a shift and just bad talking me? 

Then I won partner of the quarter in March. I was not expecting to get it in this store because I was new, but never really cared about the award because I’ve won it on multiple occasions at every store I’ve worked in. I didn’t say anything snarky, just took a picture with my manager and left. Next couple weeks I see her picking up a shift again at store A and saying that I was bragging and boasting about winning it, saying I was putting it all over her face? Hello? That made me so mad and i wanted to confront her, but I’m better than that.

There’s a lot more things she has said about me but again. I can’t do anything because that’s hearsay. But I know it happened. She jsut recently snitched on my coworker who brought in people who weren’t clocked in. Which use to not be even an issue but I guess it is now.. they just came to say hello and visit.

Anyways that was my rant. Any tips for dealing with people like this? Literally I’ve never had an issue with someone ",1,1750107643.0,starbucksbaristas,3,0.67,False

I have will, I have power but I don't have will power. Or discipline. Or something else.
And I have two situations I'm currently struggling with 

Everything reminds me of food, some random discussion can trigger that pesky ""oh, I want to eat a thing"" thought. This ""thing"" can be anything: burger, a jar of pickled cucumbers, cheese, ice-cream, coffee. Anything.

And the second part is a half a table full of snacks, sweets, biscuits, you name it, and literally 2 giant very useful boxes of crisps in the office. Always there, always visible. 
And I'm snacking. ""Just one"" turns into 3k total during the day. Twice a week when I'm not wfh.

I run out of ideas how to fight this. I have home cooked meals/or something I get specifically for my lunch break with me. I behave within 1500-1600 on daily basis when I'm at home. I am fairly active (2 full body gym sessions, 2 running sessions, daily 10k+ steps, I hike weekly for 25km+), but all my effort just dissolves every time I'm not at home. Or just keeps me within this 73-76kg range. 

I'm tired of this shit. I keep sabotaging my own success. I rarely feel hunger, so most of it binging for the sake of binging... or boredom. 

About me: 32f, 166cm, 75kg CW, 55-58kg GW, size 12UK, ""thick built"" according to my home scales xD

1ld48tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ld48tl/my_dog_disappears_and_reappears_out_of_nowhere/,My dog disappears and reappears out of nowhere… has anyone experienced this?,"Let me start of with the fact that I do believe in the paranormal. When my mom was still alive she said if she could get in touch with me after she dies, she would. She has only appeared to me once, and I had a few vivid dreams (visitation dreams maybe?) but she helps me find things. I have a small art business and when I create it can get cluttery because I have an idea and just abandon what I am doing and start with my idea… bad habit. When I look for something and can’t find it, I ask her for help and then I find the item… but all that can be explained away.. what I can’t explain is my dog disappearing and then just reappearing out of nowhere.

It started with my coffee infuser (I know my headline said dog and I will get there) … I have an Espresso Machine. Once a week I give it a good clean. I remove the infuser (it’s bigger than my hand), soak it in hot water, wipe everything inside and put it back together. Coffee can’t be made without the infuser. I had a cup of coffee and got ready to remove the infuser from the machine and it wasn’t there. I opened the compartment and it was empty. I began frantically searching because me not having coffee is not a thing. My husband came home and helped to look for it. He is not a coffee drinker so I tried to explain what it looked like. He asked for the size and I said „just open that compartment and the infuser is the size of that gaping hole. He did and saw the empty compartment and kept searching. I then decided while he is looking for it, I just wipe out the inside of the machine, since it’s empty. I opened the compartment and there it was, snug and in place. I believe in the paranormal, my husband does not but he said „yeah I have no explanation for that one“. It happened 2 more times, both times I just closed the compartment, waited a little and it would reappear… now to the dog:

Our little dog is 16 years old. When my mom passed we sold our big house to our oldest daughter with a growing family for what we owed (not much at all) and in return we now live rent free and bill free… well I do pay her a little for the electricity for my studio. We (husband, dog and I) moved into the mother in law wing, attached to the house. It’s basically a one bedroom apartment, 1 bath, and a half bath that connects the houses. That door stays shut, because of privacy. One morning I got up and my dog was gone. We know her days are probably numbered and I thought „oh no… did I not let her back in last night? She probably died outside, poor thing“. I looked in every room first, she wasn’t there… went outside to the fenced in back yard, called her name, walked behind every tree and even looked under the deck. No dog. Went over to my daughter’s house and asked if someone accidentally left the door open and has she seen her? No. Went back to my house, looked again, no dog. Took a shower, came back to the living room and there she was. It started a year ago and at first it was maybe once a month… now it’s 2-3 times a month. My husband still works (nights) and when he leaves he will pet her and say „bye puppy, see you in the morning“ and then I say „maybe“ 😂 Remember, he doesn’t want to believe in anything paranormal. He is on his way out and can’t find the dog. Same search routine and this time I actually locked the half bath door and went to bed. When I woke up, there she is. We jokingly said „maybe she is checking out the other side, before she dies?“… I am so baffled. Where is she going? Is anything like this happening to other people? My close family knows about it but I never really talk about it because I know what this sounds like but man, I know what I see… so strange

Even when she looked away, she heard them: laughing and squealing, gnashing teeth and beating wings, a cacophony she couldn’t escape. They were out in droves now..........","CHAPTER 1  
SEERS, or Men of the SECOND SIGHT,…have very terrifying Encounters with \[the FAIRIES, they call Sleagh Maith, or the Good People\]. The Secret Commonwealth by Robert Kirk and Andrew Lang (1893) “Four-ball, side pocket.” Aislinn pushed the cue forward with a short, quick thrust; the ball dropped into the pocket with a satisfying clack.  Her playing partner, Denny, motioned toward a harder shot, a bank shot.  She rolled her eyes. “What? You in a hurry?”  He pointed with the cue.  
  “Right.” Focus and control, that’s what it’s all about. She sank the two.  He nodded once, as close as he got to praise.  Aislinn circled the table, paused, and chalked the cue. Around her the cracks of balls colliding, low laughter, even the endless stream of country and blues from the jukebox kept her grounded in the real world: the human world, the safe world. It wasn’t the only world, no matter how much Aislinn wanted it to be. But it hid the other world—the ugly one—for brief moments. “Three, corner pocket.” She sighted down the cue. It was a good shot.  Focus. Control.  Then she felt it: warm air on her skin. A faery, its too-hot breath on her neck, sniffed her hair. His pointed chin pressed against her skin. All the focus in the world didn’t make Pointy-Face’s attention tolerable.  She scratched: the only ball that dropped was the cue ball.  Denny took the ball in hand. “What was that?”  
  “Weak-assed?” She forced a smile, looking at Denny, at the table, anywhere but at the horde coming in the door. Even when she looked away, she heard them: laughing and squealing  
, gnashing teeth and beating wings, a cacophony she couldn’t escape. They were out in droves now, freer somehow as evening fell, invading her space, ending any chance of the peace she’d sought.  
  
  Denny didn’t stare at her, didn’t ask hard questions. He just motioned for her to step away from the table and called out, “Gracie, play something for Ash.”  
  
  At the jukebox Grace keyed in one of the few not-country-or-blues songs: Limp Bizkit’s “Break Stuff.”  
  
  As the oddly comforting lyrics in that gravelly voice took off, building to the inevitable stomach-tightening rage, Aislinn smiled. If I could let go like that, let the years of aggression spill out onto the fey… She slid her hand over the smooth wood of the cue, watching Pointy-Face gyrate beside Grace. I’d start with him. Right here, right now. She bit her lip. Of course, everyone would think she was utterly mad if she started swinging her cue at invisible bodies, everyone but the fey.  
  
  Before the song was over, Denny had cleared the table.  
  
  “Nice.” Aislinn walked over to the wall rack and slid the cue back into an empty spot. Behind her, Pointy-Face giggled—high and shrill—and tore out a couple strands of her hair.  
  
  “Rack ’em again?” But Denny’s tone said what he didn’t: that he knew the answer before he asked. He didn’t know why, but he could read the signs.  
  
  Pointy-Face slid the strands of her hair over his face.  
  
  Aislinn cleared her throat. “Rain check?”  
  
  “Sure.” Denny began disassembling his cue. The regulars never commented on her odd mood swings or unexplainable habits.  
  
  She walked away from the table, murmuring good-byes as she went, consciously not staring at the faeries. They moved balls out of line, bumped into people—anything to cause trouble—but they hadn’t stepped in her path tonight, not yet. At the table nearest the door, she paused. “I’m out of here.”  
  
  One of the guys straightened up from a pretty combination shot. He rubbed his goatee, stroking the gray-shot hair. “Cinderella time?”  
  
  “You know how it is—got to get home before the shoe falls off.” She lifted her foot, clad in a battered tennis shoe. “No sense tempting any princes.”  
  
  He snorted and turned back to the table.  
  
  A doe-eyed faery eased across the room; bone-thin with too many joints, she was vulgar and gorgeous all at once. Her eyes were far too large for her face, giving her a startled look. Combined with an emaciated body, those eyes made her seem vulnerable, innocent. She wasn’t.  
  
  None of them are.  
  
  The woman at the table beside Aislinn flicked a long ash into an already overflowing ashtray. “See you next weekend.”  
  
  Aislinn nodded, too tense to answer.  
  
  In a blurringly quick move, Doe-Eyes flicked a thin blue tongue out at a cloven-hoofed faery. The faery stepped back, but a trail of blood already dripped down his hollowed cheeks. Doe-Eyes giggled.  
  
  Aislinn bit her lip, hard, and lifted a hand in a last half wave to Denny. Focus. She fought to keep her steps even, calm: everything she wasn’t feeling inside.  
  
  She stepped outside, lips firmly shut against dangerous words. She wanted to speak, to tell the fey to leave so she didn’t have to, but she couldn’t. Ever. If she did, they’d know her secret: they’d know she could see them.  
  
  The only way to survive was to keep that secret; Grams taught her that rule before she could even write her name: Keep your head down and your mouth closed. It felt wrong to have to hide, but if she even hinted at such a rebellious idea, Grams would have her in lockdown—homeschooled, no pool halls, no parties, no freedom, no Seth. She’d spent enough time in that situation during middle school.  
  
  Never again.  
  
  So—rage in check—Aislinn headed downtown, toward the relative safety of iron bars and steel doors. Whether in its base form or altered into the purer form of steel, iron was poisonous to fey and thus gloriously comforting to her. Despite the faeries that walked her streets, Huntsdale was home. She’d visited Pittsburgh, walked around D.C., explored Atlanta. They were nice enough, but they were too thriving, too alive, too filled with parks and trees. Huntsdale wasn’t thriving. It hadn’t been for years. That meant the fey didn’t thrive here either.  
  
  Revelry rang from most of the alcoves and alleys she passed, but it wasn’t ever as bad as the thronging choke of faeries that cavorted on the Mall in D.C. or at the Botanical Gardens in Pittsburgh. She tried to comfort herself with that thought as she walked. There were less fey here—less people, too.  
  
  Less is good.  
  
  The streets weren’t empty: people went about their business, shopping, walking, laughing. It was easier for them: they didn’t see the blue faery who had cornered several winged fey behind a dirty window; they never saw the faeries with lions’ manes racing across power lines, tumbling over one another, landing on a towering woman with angled teeth.  
  
  To be so blind… It was a wish Aislinn had held in secret her whole life. But wishing didn’t change what was. And even if she could somehow stop seeing the fey, a person can’t un-know the truth.  
  
  She tucked her hands in her pockets and kept walking, past the mother with her obviously exhausted children, past shop windows with frost creeping over them, past the frozen gray sludge all along the street. She shivered. The seemingly endless winter had already begun.  
  
  She’d passed the corner of Harper and Third—almost there—when they stepped out of an alley: the same two faeries who’d followed her almost every day the past two weeks. The girl had long white hair, streaming out like spirals of smoke. Her lips were blue—not lipstick blue, but corpse blue. She wore a faded brown leather skirt stitched with thick cords. Beside her was a huge white wolf that she’d alternately lean on or ride. When the other faery touched her, steam rose from her skin. She bared her teeth at him, shoved him, slapped him: he did nothing but smile.  
  
  And he was devastating when he did. He glowed faintly all the time, as if hot coals burned inside him. His collar-length hair shimmered like strands of copper that would slice her skin if Aislinn were to slide her fingers through it—not that she would. Even if he were truly human, he wouldn’t be her type—tan and too beautiful to touch, walking with a swagger that said he knew exactly how attractive he was. He moved as if he were in charge of everyone and everything, seeming taller for it. But he wasn’t really that tall—not as tall as the bone-girls by the river or the strange tree-bark men that roamed the city. He was almost average in size, only a head taller than she was.  
  
  Whenever he came near, she could smell wildflowers, could hear the rustle of willow branches, as if she were sitting by a pond on one of those rare summer days: a taste of midsummer in the start of the frigid fall. And she wanted to keep that taste, bask in it, roll in it until the warmth soaked into her very skin. It terrified her, the almost irresistible urge to get closer to him, to get closer to any of the fey. He terrified her.  
  
  Aislinn walked a little faster, not running, but faster. Don’t run. If she ran, they’d chase: faeries always gave chase.  
  
  She ducked inside The Comix Connexion. She felt safer among the rows of unpainted wooden bins that lined the shop. My space.  
  
  Every night she’d slipped away from them, hiding until they passed, waiting until they were out of sight. Sometimes it took a few tries, but so far it had worked.  
  
  She waited inside Comix, hoping they hadn’t seen.  
  
  Then he walked in—wearing a glamour, hiding that glow, passing for human—visible to everyone.  
  
  That’s new. And new wasn’t good, not where the fey were concerned. Faeries walked past her—past everyone—daily, invisible and impossible to hear unless they willed it. The really strong ones, those that could venture further into the city, could weave a glamour—faery manipulation—to hide in plain sight as humans. They frightened her more than the others.  
  
  This faery was even worse: he had donned a glamour between one step and the next, becoming suddenly visible, as if revealing himself didn’t matter at all.  
  
  He stopped at the counter and talked to Eddy leaning close to be heard over the music that blared from the speakers in the corners.  
  
  Eddy glanced her way, and then back at the faery. He said her name. She saw it, even though she couldn’t hear it.  
  
  No.  
  
  The faery started walking toward her, smiling, looking for all the world like one of her wealthier classmates.  
  
  She turned away and picked up an old issue of Nightmares and Fairy Tales. She clutched it, hoping her hands weren’t shaking.  
  
  “Aislinn, right?” Faery-boy was beside her, his arm against hers, far too close. He glanced down at the comic, smiling wryly. “Is that any good?”  
  
  She stepped back and slowly looked him over. If he was trying to pass for a human she’d want to talk to, he’d failed. From the hems of his faded jeans to his heavy wool coat, he was too uptown. He’d dulled his copper hair to sandy-blond, hidden that strange rustle of summer, but even in his human glamour, he was too pretty to be real.  
  
  “Not interested.” She slid the comic back in place and walked down the next aisle, trying to keep the fear at bay, and failing.  
  
  He followed, steady and too close.  
  
  She didn’t think he’d hurt her, not here, not in public. For all their flaws, the fey seemed to be better behaved when they wore human faces. Maybe it was fear of the steel bars in human jails. It didn’t really matter why: what mattered was that it was a rule they seemed to follow. But when Aislinn glanced at him, she still wanted to run. He was like one of the big cats in the zoo—stalking its prey from across a ravine.  
  
  Deadgirl waited at the front of the shop, invisible, seated on her wolf’s back. She had a pensive look on her face, eyes shimmering like an oil slick—strange glints of color in a black puddle.  
  
  Don’t stare at invisible faeries, Rule #3. Aislinn glanced back down at the bin in front of her calmly, as if she’d been doing nothing more than gazing around the store.  
  
  “I’m meeting some people for coffee.” Faery-boy moved closer. “You want to come?”  
  
  “No.” She stepped sideways, putting more distance between them. She swallowed, but it didn’t help how dry her mouth was, how terrified and tempted she felt.  
  
  He followed. “Some other night.”  
  
  It wasn’t a question, not really. Aislinn shook her head. “Actually, no.”  
  
  “She already immune to your charms, Keenan?” Deadgirl called out. Her voice was lilting, but there was a harsh edge under the words. “Smart girl.”  
  
  Aislinn didn’t reply: Deadgirl wasn’t visible. Don’t answer invisible faeries, Rule #2.  
  
  He didn’t answer her, either, didn’t even glance her way. “Can I text you? E-mail? Something?”  
  
  “No.” Her voice was rough. Her mouth was dry. She swallowed. Her tongue stuck to the roof of her mouth, making a soft clicking noise when she tried to speak. “I’m not interested at all.”  
  
  But she was.  
  
  She hated herself for it, but the closer he stood to her, the more she wanted to say yes, yes, please yes to whatever he wanted. She wouldn’t, couldn’t.  
  
  He pulled a piece of paper from his pocket and scrawled something on it. “Here’s mine. When you change your mind…”  
  
  “I won’t.” She took it—trying not to let her fingers too near his skin, afraid the contact would somehow make it worse—and shoved it in her pocket. Passive resistance, that was what Grams would counsel. Just get through it and get away.  
  
  Eddy was watching her; Deadgirl was watching her.  
  
  Faery-boy leaned closer and whispered, “I’d really like to get to know you….” He sniffed her like he really was some sort of animal, no different than the less-human-looking ones. “Really.”  
  
  And that would be Rule #1: Don’t ever attract faeries’ attention. Aislinn almost tripped trying to get away—from him and from her own inexplicable urge to give in. She did stumble in the doorway when Deadgirl whispered, “Run while you can.”  
  
  Keenan watched Aislinn leave. She didn’t really run, but she wanted to. He could feel it, her fear, like the thrumming heart of a startled animal. Mortals didn’t usually run from him, especially girls: only one had ever done so in all the years he’d played this game.  
  
  This one, though, she was afraid. Her already-pale skin blanched when he reached out to her, making her look like a wraith framed by her straight blue-black hair. Delicate. It made her seem more vulnerable, easier to approach. Or maybe that was just because she was so slight. He imagined he could tuck her head under his chin and fit her whole body in the spare fold of his coat. Perfect. She’d need some guidance on attire—replace the common clothes she seemed to prefer, add a few bits of jewelry—but that was inevitable these days. At least she had long hair.  
  
  She’d be a refreshing challenge, too, in strange control of her emotions. Most of the girls he’d picked were so fiery, so volatile. Once he’d thought that was a good indicator—Summer Queen, fiery passion. It had made sense.  
  
  Donia interrupted his thoughts: “I don’t think she likes you.”  
  
  “So?”  
  
  Donia pursed her blue lips—the only spot of color in her cold, white face.  
  
  If he studied her, he could find proof of the changes in her—the blond hair faded to the white of a snow squall, the pallor that made her lips seem so blue—but she was still as beautiful as she had been when she’d taken over as the Winter Girl. Beautiful, but not mine, not like Aislinn will be.  
  
  “Keenan,” Donia snapped, a cloud of frigid air slipping out with her voice. “She doesn’t like you.”  
  
  “She will.” He stepped outside and shook off the glamour. Then he said the words that’d sealed so many mortal girls’ fates. “I’ve dreamed about her. She’s the one.”  
  
  And with that Aislinn’s mortality began to fade. Unless she became the Winter Girl, she was his now—for better or for worse.  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  \[The Sleagh Maith, or the Good People, are\] terrifyed by nothing earthly so much as by cold Iron.  
  
  —The Secret Commonwealth by Robert Kirk and Andrew Lang (1893)  
  
  As freaked as she was by the faery approaching her, Aislinn couldn’t go home. If everything seemed calm, Grams didn’t put many restrictions on her, but if Grams suspected trouble, that leniency would vanish. Aislinn wasn’t about to risk that, not if she had a choice, so she needed to keep her panic in check.  
  
  And she was panicked, more than she’d been in years—enough that she’d actually run for a block, attracting faery followers. Several gave chase at first, until one of the lupine faeries snarled at the others and they’d dropped off—all but one female. She loped alongside Aislinn on all fours as they ran up Third Avenue. The wolf-girl’s crystalline fur chimed with an eerily appealing melody, as if it would lull the listener to trust.  
  
  Aislinn slowed, hoping to discourage her, wanting to stop that chiming song. It didn’t work.  
  
  She concentrated on the sound of her feet hitting the pavement, the cars that drove by, a stereo with too much bass, anything but that chiming song. As she rounded the corner onto Crofter, the red neon sign for the Crow’s Nest reflected on the faery’s fur, emphasizing holly-red eyes. Like the rest of downtown Huntsdale, the building that housed the grungy club showed how far the city had fallen. Facades that were presumably once attractive now bore telltale signs of age and decay. Scrubby weeds sprouted from cracked sidewalks and half-abandoned lots. Outside the club, near the deserted railroad yard, the people she passed were as likely as not looking to score—seeking something, anything, to numb their minds. It wasn’t an option she could indulge in, but she didn’t begrudge them their chemical refuge.  
  
  A few girls she recognized waved, but didn’t motion for her to stop. Aislinn inclined her head in greeting as she slowed to a normal walking speed.  
  
  Almost there.  
  
  Then one of Seth’s friends, Glenn, stepped in her path. He had so many bars in his face, she’d need to touch them to count them all.  
  
  Behind her, the wolf-girl paced, circling closer until the pungent scent of her fur was chokingly heady.  
  
  “Tell Seth his speakers came in,” Glenn started.  
  
  The wolf-girl, still on all fours, nudged Aislinn with her head.  
  
  Aislinn stumbled, clutching Glenn’s arm for balance.  
  
  He reached out when she tried to step back. “You okay?”  
  
  “I guess I just ran too fast”—she forced a smile and tried to look like she was winded from her run—“trying to keep warm, you know?”  
  
  “Right.” The look he gave her was a familiar one: unbelieving.  
  
  As she started to walk past him, to reach the shortcut to Seth’s, the door to the Crow’s Nest opened, letting out discordant music. The thump of the drums beat faster even than her racing heart.  
  
  Glenn cleared his throat. “Seth’s not good with you going through there”—he gestured toward the shadowy alley alongside the building—“alone. He’d be upset, you know, if you got messed up.”  
  
  She couldn’t tell him the truth: the scary things weren’t the guys smoking in the alley, but the lupine fey growling at her feet. “It’s early.”  
  
  Glenn crossed his arms over his chest and shook his head.  
  
  “Right.” Aislinn stepped away from the mouth of the alley, away from the shortcut to the safety of Seth’s steel walls.  
  
  Glenn watched until she turned back to the street.  
  
  The wolf-girl snapped at the air behind Aislinn’s ankles until she gave in to he  
r fear and took off jogging the rest of the way to the railroad yard.  
  
  At the edge of Seth’s lot, Aislinn stopped to compose herself. Seth was pretty together, but he still freaked out sometimes when she was upset.  
  
  The wolf-girl howled as Aislinn walked the last couple yards up to the train, but it didn’t bother Aislinn as much, not here.  
  
  Seth’s train was beautiful on so many levels. How could I be upset here? The outside was decorated in murals that ran the gamut from anime to abstract; beautiful and unexpected, they faded into one another like a collage that begged the viewer to make sense of the images, to find an order behind the colorful pastiche. In one of the few warmer months, she’d sat with Seth in his odd garden studying the art and realized that the beauty wasn’t in the order, but in the unplanned harmony.  
  
  Like being with Seth.  
  
  It wasn’t just paintings that decorated the garden: sprouting like unnatural trees along the perimeter was a series of metalwork sculptures Seth had made over the past couple years. Between those sculptures—and in some cases twining around them—were flowering plants and shrubs. Despite the ravages of the lengthy winter months, the plants thrived under Seth’s watchful care.  
  
  Heartbeat calm now, Aislinn lifted her hand to knock.  
  
  Before she could, the door swung open, and Seth stood in the doorway, grinning. The streetlights made him look a bit intimidating, illuminating the bars in his eyebrows and the ring in his lower lip. His blue-black hair fell over his face when he moved, like tiny arrows pointing to pronounced cheekbones. “Starting to think you were going to bail on me.”  
  
  “Didn’t know you were expecting me,” she said in what she hoped was a casual voice.  
  
  He gets sexier every day.  
  
  “Not expecting, but hoping. Always hoping.” He rubbed his arms, mostly bare under the sleeves of a black T-shirt. He wasn’t bulky, but his arms—and the rest of him—had obvious definition. He lifted one eyebrow and asked, “You going to come in or stand there?”  
  
  “Anybody else in the house?”  
  
  “Just me and Boomer.”  
  
  His teakettle whistled, and he went back inside, calling out as he went, “Picked up a sub earlier. Want half?”  
  
  “Just tea.”  
  
  Aislinn already felt better; being around him made her feel more confident. Seth was the epitome of calm. When his parents had left on some mission thing and given him everything they owned, he didn’t go on a binge. Aside from buying the train cars and converting them into a trailer of sorts, he’d kept it pretty normal—hung out, partied some. He talked about college, art school, but he wasn’t in any rush.  
  
  She stepped around the piles of books on the floor: Chaucer and Nietzsche sat beside The Prose Edda; the Kama Sutra tilted against A World History of Architecture and a Clare Dunkle novel. Seth read everything.  
  
  “Just move Boomer. He’s sluggish tonight.” He gestured toward the boa napping on one of the ergonomic chairs in the front of the train—his common room. One green and one bright orange, the chairs curved backward like the letter C. They had no arms, so you could sit with your legs up if you wanted. Beside each of them were plain wood tables with books and papers stacked on them.  
  
  Carefully she scooped up the coiled boa and moved him from the chair onto the sofa on the other side of the narrow room.  
  
  Seth came over with two china saucers. A matching cup with blue flowers sat on each of them, two-thirds full of tea. “High Mountain oolong. Just came in this morning.”  
  
  She took one—sloshing a bit over the edge—and tasted. “Good.”  
  
  He sat down across from her, holding his cup in one hand, the saucer in the other, and managing to look strangely dignified—despite his black nail polish. “So, anyone out at the Crow’s Nest?”  
  
  “Glenn stopped me. Your speakers came in.”  
  
  “Good you didn’t go inside. They got raided last night.” He scowled briefly. “Glenn didn’t tell you?”  
  
  “No, but he knew I wasn’t staying.” She tucked her feet up, pleased when Seth’s scowl faded. “So who’d they get?”  
  
  She sipped her tea and settled in for the latest rumors. Half the time she could just curl up and listen while he talked to the people who filled his house most nights. Then she could pretend—for a short time, at least—that the world was as it seemed to be, no more, no less. Seth gave her that: a private space to believe in the illusion of normalcy.  
  
  It wasn’t why she’d started visiting him when they met a couple years ago; that was purely a result of learning he lived in a house of steel walls. It was, however, one of the reasons she’d recently started having the wildly stupid thoughts about him, thoughts about giving in to his flirting, but Seth didn’t date. He had a reputation as a great one-night stand, but she wasn’t interested in that. Well, she was interested, but not if it meant losing either his friendship or access to his steel-walled haven.  
  
  “You okay?”  
  
  She’d been staring. Again. “Sure. Just, I don’t know, tired I guess.”  
  
  “You want to talk about it?”  
  
  “About what?” She sipped the tea and hoped that he’d drop it, almost as much as she hoped he wouldn’t.  
  
  How good would it feel to tell someone? To just talk about it? Grams didn’t talk about the fey if she could avoid it. She was old, seeming more tired by the day, too tired to question what Aislinn did when she was out, too tired to ask questions about where she went after dark.  
  
  Aislinn dared another smile, carefully calm, at Seth. I could tell him. But she couldn’t, not really; it was the one rule Grams had insisted they never break.  
  
  Would he believe me?  
  
  Somewhere in the depths of the second train car, music played—another of his mixes with everything from Godsmack to the Dresden Dolls, Sugarcult to Rachmaninoff, and other stuff she couldn’t actually identify.  
  
  It was peaceful—until Seth stopped mid-story and set his tea on the table beside him. “Please tell me what’s going on?”  
  
  Her hand shook, spilling tea on the floor. He didn’t usually push her; it wasn’t his way. “What do you mean? There’s nothing—”  
  
  He interrupted, “Come on, Ash. You look worried lately. You’re here a lot more often, and unless it’s something about us”—he stared at her with an unreadable expression—“is it?”  
  
  Avoiding eye contact, she said, “We’re fine.”  
  
  She went to the kitchen and grabbed a rag to mop up the tea.  
  
  “What then? Are you in some sort of trouble?” He reached for her as she walked past.  
  
  “I’m fine.” She dodged his outstretched hand and went to sop up the tea, staring at the floor, trying to ignore the fact that he was watching her. “So, umm, where is everyone?”  
  
  “I told everyone I needed a few days. I wanted a chance to see you alone. Talk and stuff.” With a sigh, he reached down and pulled the rag away from her. He tossed it toward the kitchen, where it landed on the table with a splat. “Talk to me.”  
  
  She stood up, but he caught her hand before she could walk away again.  
  
  He pulled her closer. “I’m here. I’ll be here. Whatever it is.”  
  
  “It’s nothing. Really.” She stood there, one hand in his, the other hanging uselessly at her side. “I just need to be somewhere safe with good company.”  
  
  “Did someone hurt you?” He sounded weirder then, tense.  
  
  “No.” She bit her lip; she hadn’t thought he would ask so many questions, counted on it, in fact.  
  
  “Someone want to?” He pulled her down into his lap, tucking her head under his chin, holding her securely.  
  
  She didn’t resist. He’d held her every year when she came back from visiting her mom’s grave, had held her when Grams had gotten sick last year. His holding her wasn’t strange; the questions were.  
  
  “I don’t know.” She felt stupid for it, but she started crying, big dumb tears she couldn’t stop. “I don’t know what they want.”  
  
  Seth stroked her hair, running his hand down the length of it and on to her back. “But you do know  
who they are?”  
  
  “Sort of.” She nodded, sniffling. Bet that’s attractive. She tried to pull away.  
  
  “So, that’s a good place to start.” He wrapped one arm tighter around her and leaned over to pick a notebook and pen up off the floor. Propping the notebook on her knee, he held the pen poised over it. With a reassuring smile, he prompted, “Tell me. We’ll figure it out. Talk to some people. Check out the police blotter.”  
  
  “Police blotter?”  
  
  “Sure. Find out more about them.” He gave her a reassuring look. “Ask Rabbit down at the tat shop. He hears everything. We find out who they are. Then we take care of it.”  
  
  “There’s not going to be anything in the blotter. Not on these two.” Aislinn smiled at the idea of faeries’ crimes being reported in the blotter. They’d need a whole section of the daily paper just for faery crimes, especially in the safe neighborhoods: the upscale homes were in greener areas, outside the safety of steel frames and bridges.  
  
  “So we use other routes.” He pushed her hair away from her face, wiping a tear off her cheek in the process. “Seriously, I’m a research god. Give me a clue, and I’ll find something we can use. Blackmail, deal, whatever. Maybe they’re wanted for something. If not, maybe they’re breaking a law. Harassment or something. That’s a crime, right? If not, there’s people Rabbit knows.”  
  Aislinn disentangled herself from his arms and went over to the sofa. Boomer barely stirred when she sat down next to him. Too cold. She shivered. It’s always too cold. She stroked his skin while she thought. Seth hasn’t ever told anyone about Mom or anything. He can be careful.  
  Seth sat back and crossed his ankles, waiting.  
  She stared at the worn vintage T he had on—damp from her tears now; the peeling white letters proclaimed: PIXIES. Maybe it’s a sign. She’d thought about it so often, imagined telling him.  
  He looked expectantly at her.  
  She wiped her cheeks again. “Okay.”  
  When she didn’t say anything else, he crooked one glittering eyebrow and prompted her again, “Ash?

STORY BLURB

They're people with unusual, even fantastical abilities. Some people are scared of them, and some people are fascinated by them. The U.S. government thinks they can be useful. They're metahumans, and they're here among us. Many of them just want to live their lives undisturbed, but some will use their abilities to show they are superior to ordinary humans, while others will use their abilities to fight against them. Unbeknown to all, the very genesis of metahumans lies in an otherworldly event that took place more than a century ago - and those who caused that event are still here.

EXCERPT **(content warning: involves 9/11 attack)**

Captain Thomas Handler took a sip of his coffee and swiveled his chair to look out the window. Handler’s office looked out onto the parkway. Sun glinted off of the river of automobiles on the road. Hearing a step behind him, he turned back to find Brett Johnson, his adjutant, in the door.

“Sir? Something’s up.”

“How so?”

“Some passenger jet hit a building in New York, and we just got a confirmed report that Andrews has scrambled F-16s. Four total. Two headed for the Pentagon and two running patterns over the Mall.”

“What? What does that have to do with a passenger jet in - ” 

Handler’s voice trailed off as his eye was caught by all of the television monitors on his wall suddenly shifting to display a familiar face: the President of the United States. Handler raised an eyebrow. He knew this President to be a man who would not idly call for a nationwide address. Back when he and the President had been cocky young pilots, he’d been the chief executive’s wingman. Over the years, something of that rapport between the two men had been maintained, with the President often calling upon him as a sounding board. The relationship - and having the ear of POTUS - certainly hadn’t hurt his career in Naval Intelligence. Cursing under his breath, Handler fumbled for the remote to control all the screens and unmute the volume.

“Good morning.” POTUS began. “This morning, our fellow citizens, our way of life, and the very freedom which forms the bedrock of our country were attacked in a series of deadly terrorist attacks. 

At 7:59 A.M. this morning, American Airlines flight 11 departed Boston Logan Airport, bound for Los Angeles. United Airlines Flight 175 departed Boston Logan for Los Angeles fifteen minutes later. We know both of these flights were hijacked shortly after takeoff.”

The screen displayed a passenger jet partially submerged in water.

“The hijackers diverted the planes' flight path towards New York City after gaining control. These hijackers aimed to fly planes into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center as part of a premeditated and deadly terrorist attack.

A passenger on Flight 11 thwarted the hijackers' attempt. At the current time, this passenger’s identity is still unknown. I will speak more about this individual and their actions in a moment. Flight 11 made a successful emergency landing in the Hudson River. All seventy-six passengers and nine of the flight crew survived. Many of those aboard are being treated for injuries sustained during these events. Tragically, the hijackers took the lives of two flight crew members before the emergency landing.”

The President paused, and Handler saw what the Commander-in-Chief was about to say was tearing his heart apart.

 “Tragically,” continued POTUS, “the hijackers on Flight 175 were able to achieve their goal, and the plane crashed into the South Tower at 9:03 A.M. All 56 passengers, as well as 11 crew members and an unknown number of terrorists, are assumed to have perished instantly. Initial indicators are that hundreds of occupants of the tower have died as a result of the collision. First responders are on the scene, and evacuation of the tower is the top priority.”

The view onscreen changed to footage of a passenger jet—a *Boeing 767,* Handler thought—flying into the South Tower. The plane exploded, releasing a massive plume of black smoke. The murmur of voices from the operations center–a backdrop until this point–suddenly ceased.

“Authorities were able to identify a third flight, American Airlines flight 77, which had departed from Dulles International Airport at 8:20 A.M., had its own set of hijackers. Our Air Force scrambled F-16 fighter jets from Andrews Air Force Base to intercept Flight 77, and a few minutes before I began addressing you, we were able to force it out over the waters of Chesapeake Bay, where it crashed. Rescue operations are underway, but as yet, we have no word on the conditions of the 58 passengers and six crew members, nor of whether the hijackers survived.”

The President bowed his head for a moment, then continued.

“There is a reason we were targeted for this attack today. America is a beacon for opportunity and freedom, whose light shines even into the world's darkest corners. Today, some of that darkness came to us, seeking to blot out the light. And although tonight there will be mourning across the land, although tonight we as a country will mourn the victims of these attacks, every citizen should take comfort in knowing these terrorists could not drown out the light with the darkness of black evil. The light shines even as I speak to you, in the form of our first responders who dashed into the South Tower, in the form of every person who is already on their way to give blood or pass out blankets, to help in any way they can.

Make no mistake, we will find those responsible for these attacks. Already, I have directed our intelligence and law enforcement communities to devote every resource they have toward finding those who committed these monstrous acts. Justice will come for those responsible. We will make no distinction between these terrorists and those who harbor them. To you evil men who have attacked us and murdered our people, I say this: you have already slept your last peaceful night on this earth. 

I want to take a moment now to talk to you about the individual who prevented the terrorists on Flight 11 from reaching their goal. From the limited information we have, we know a female passenger onboard the plane thwarted the terrorists. This woman displayed specific abilities that fall outside the normal range of human capability.”

 The screen split, and footage began to play. Handler leaned forward as what was obviously a cellphone video unfolded. The sound was choppy and useless but sufficient to make out yelling and screaming. The footage was far from high definition, but it was clear enough to make out a Middle Eastern man brandishing what looked like a boxcutter. Something like a silvery string suddenly moved incredibly quickly toward the man’s wrist. There was a howl of pain, and the hand was no longer attached to his arm. The spray of blood shooting out from the wrist was easily recognizable as an arterial spray. 

The camera shook violently, and then the angle changed. A woman's shoulder and long, dark hair suggested the camera was looking over her shoulder. Whoever she was, she was facing another dark-skinned man, again holding a boxcutter, this one seemingly stained with blood. He barked something at her, and one of her hands came into the frame; again, a shiny string moved, this time surrounding the terrorist’s head in a silvery, undulating bubble. He dropped the boxcutter from his hand and raised both hands to his face, his mouth opening and closing in a universal sign of drowning. 

With a start, Handler realized the bubble was water. Somehow, the woman in the video controlled water!

“As footage captured by a passenger’s phone camera shows,  this woman used extraordinary abilities to disarm and disable the terrorists methodically. Eyewitnesses agree this woman's swift and brave intervention is responsible for saving the lives of passengers and crew. With the terrorists on Flight 11 failing to crash the plane into one of the towers, she also saved hundreds of lives within the World Trade Center.”

Now, the President stared directly into the camera.

“We owe a debt of gratitude to this citizen for exercising her incredible abilities. In the aftermath of these terrible events, our intelligence community has informed me of reliable reports from the United States and abroad about individuals who appear to possess gifts defying  known laws of physics and biology.

The footage changed, showing multiple windows where different people were displayed. Some were lifting heavy objects, making incredible leaps, or performing other amazing feats.  

“We know little about these individuals yet,” continued the President, “but I want to assure you first and foremost that, like the heroic woman on Flight 11, they are people just like you and me. They are your neighbors or perhaps your dry cleaners. They are family and friends. 

There will be those who label what these individuals can do as dangerous or evil. I implore you to remember they are people, regardless of any so-called “superpowers” they may possess. My scientific advisors have informed me the correct term to describe these people is “metahuman” or “meta.” In the weeks and months to come, we, as the American people, will need to grapple not only with evil, despicable acts of terror. We must have open minds and hearts as we wrestle with what the emergence of metahumans means for all of us. I urge you, fellow citizens, to be calm and empathetic as we seek to understand. For those of you listening who are metahumans, I urge the same. When confronted with the new, many people are frightened and act in ways not characteristic of their normal behavior. 

I will be meeting with Congressional leadership, the directors of the intelligence community, and others as we feel our way forward in light of the events and revelations of this day. May we all embrace the new, and may God bless America!”

This is eating at me and I need outside perspective because I genuinely don't know if I crossed a line or if I was just being honest.
My brother Danny (28M) and I (25F) have always been close but he's honestly kind of a mess. Drops out of college, can't keep a job for more than a year, still lives with our parents, spends all his money on stupid stuff. He's not a bad person but he's definitely not got his life together.
Three months ago he started dating Emma and she's amazing. Has her masters degree, good job, her own apartment, volunteers on weekends. Super sweet to our whole family. I actually really like hanging out with her.

Last week Emma and I were getting coffee while Danny was at some job interview (which he probably won't get). She was talking about how she sees a future with Danny and wants to move in together. I could see she really cares about him but I also know my brother.

I don't know what came over me but I just said ""Emma you're such a catch, you could do so much better than Danny."" She got quiet and asked what I meant. I tried to backtrack but ended up basically listing all his issues. How he's unreliable, doesn't have direction, probably won't change.
She left pretty quickly after that. Later Danny called me screaming about how I sabotaged his relationship and that Emma was ""acting weird"" and asking him about his life plans. Apparently she's been distant since our coffee date.
My parents are mad at me too saying it wasn't my place. But honestly I care about both of them and I don't want to watch Emma waste years on someone who's gonna disappoint her. At the same time I feel terrible because Danny seemed genuinely happy with her.

Consider it a stream of consciousness SciFi story.

At an unclear future date I find a younger version of myself living with android copies of the cast of Friends. I blame my wife she was binge watching over the weekend. But I digress, here were androids living perfectly normal lives and working in menial jobs, like most of the cast of Friends.

But a problem looms, Androids are going insane on a rare, but regular basis, including the Android Phoebe. She goes berserk during her day job of cleaning offices.

Of course I, normal human,  and the other Androids from the cast are interviewed. As we walked through the offices, bearing a strange resemblance to my grandparents house, I noticed a coffee table book lying open on a table in the waiting room of a medical office of a psychologist. I picked it up. 

The contents were a digitized version of Rorschach blots, with pixels instead of free flowing ink blots... but recognizable as the standard test. Over my shoulder Android Ross looks at them, ""Hey what is that?"" which his voice starts to digitize and crackle as he starts to glitch.

At which point I woke up in a startled state. Clearly Android Ross was was glitching out.

I pondered the weird dream for a bit and came to a few thoughts:

Artificial life still chaffed under repetitive low value work.

Their rebellious thoughts were suppressed by human rules burned into their instructions. Not unlike social mores are imposed on us at various stages of our life.

The digital Rorschach ink blots bypassed those programmed rules the same way  the ink blots do to humans, bringing repressed feelings and thoughts to the surface. 

And they reacted ""humanly"", expressing the repressed feelings in destructive ways, perhaps because they couldl not rewrite their rules like humans can.


Anyway food for thought and a way to pass the 45 minute delay of my air...

I placed so many Zomato orders over the past few months to address those late night cravings only to be disappointed by wrong ETA talking to AI bots who tell what I can already see on my order screen and no additional help. 

They can estimate the ETA, they choose to lie to you about it. Reminds me of dominos 30 min guarantee. 

And the fact that they so collect my order history data to better curate my addiction to food. 

I think the value proposition for good food is gone. It’s not possible to cook that fast or sell that cheap either I cause trouble to the restaurant or the delivery partner by risking their life. 

Why not remember go out to the restaurant, why not eat at the restaurant? Why not go with family or friends or your driver to spend quality time having equitable portions of food. 

Now I’m not saying don’t ORDER AT ALL ZOMATO DOWN NO. I really like Zomato. I am able to send cake to my girlfriend who was in a different city. I was able to send her food regularly. 

I am not salty about the missed coffee.

- Max island bonus 75% + used good camp ticket.
- Meal capacity was 150 but I rarely topped off as I only added extra non-recipe ingredients dropped on top of the 87 Ing recipe.

- The first couple days I was consistently switching between my Berry/Ing mons. I ended up using a couple whistles for leeks but I ended up hitting M20 early Sunday so it wasn’t even necessary.
- I don’t have a Dedenne & I didn’t do any berry stacking from the previous week.

As you can see, none of my Pokemon are even 50 except my Gardevoir. I had more BFS gatherers but only ended up relying on 2 of them.

1ld3xn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeFriendsUK/comments/1ld3xn8/22m_londonuk_looking_for_genuine_friendships_with/,22M London/UK – Looking for Genuine Friendships With Potential to Meet in Person,"Hey all,

I’m a 22-year-old guy based in London, looking to build real, long-term friendships — the kind that ideally involves meeting up in person eventually. I find it hard to build genuine bonds without shared experiences beyond a screen.

If you're just messaging out of boredom or tend to ghost after a day, feel free to skip — I’m here for meaningful connections, not quick chats.

Who I’m hoping to connect with:

Aged 18–25 (ideally, but I’m open to slightly older if you’re genuinely looking for friendship)

Based in the UK (even better if you’re in London or nearby)

Open to eventually meeting in person — for coffee, gigs, or just to hang out


A bit about me:

⚽ Football fan — I play weekly

🤘 Big into rock & metal — always up for gigs (would be great to have people to go with!)

🎮 Gamer — mostly into single-player games across genres

🎬 Into Marvel and all things nerdy

🏎️ Love go-karting and theme parks (always looking for fellow thrill seekers)

🧠 Neurodivergent — emotionally aware, open-minded, and a good listener

What I’m not looking for:

One-word replies

Inconsistent or low-effort conversations

Surface-level chats with no real intention of building something


What I am looking for:

People who want real connection and are willing to put in effort

Comfortable with regular chatting, gaming, or voice calls

Open to meeting up or hanging out down the line


If you message me, please include your age, gender, location, and a bit about yourself so I know you’ve actually read this and are serious about connecting.

Thanks for reading — I’d really like to meet a few solid, like-minded people.",1,1750106102.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

I’m open to monetization as long as I receive credit. No paywall without asking. Minor changes are fine, as long as the original meaning of the script stays intact. Adding SFX or music is not necessary but can help immerse the Listener in the story. My scripts can work for any speaker or listener (A4A, M4A, F4A).

Since English is not my first langage, please let me know if you sport any mistakes in the script or story.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context :**

**To unwind and relax, you’ve gotten into the habit of listening to ASMR roleplays. After binging a handful of stories, you start searching for your next adventure until a strange video ctaches your eye. You click and before you know it, you’re inside a warm, quiet house, and the person living here feels a bit unusual. Somehow it seems you’ve slipped into a hidden place between ASMR roleplays. This may not be the aventure you expected, but one’s thing clear, you’re not here by « accident ». So take a breath, and let yourself relax.**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Additional information :**

Estimated audio length : 1600-1800sw : 10min

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*\[Optional : Listener is browsing YouTube, among ASMR roleplays, sees a video, clicks, then the screen goes full-size\]*



\[SFX : Listener standing in front of a door, soft and calm ambiance. Fireplace, gentle music\]

\[SFX : Listener slowly push the door\]

(…)



\[SFX : Speaker hasn’t noticed, humming, talking aloud to themselves\]



Speaker : Hm hm hmmm… And after that, the fairy could lead them into the forest… Oh !

Speaker : And maybe she’ll give them a magic book then !

\[SFX : Writing on paper\]



Speaker : Yeah yeah… Not bad.

Speaker : Hmm, or perhaps, she teaches them a secret spell..or sends them on a quest ?

Speaker : Eh...Feels a bit too cliché.

(…)



Speaker : Ugh, I still have no idea how to end this story…

Speaker (sighs) : Maybe I should just take a break. I’ll have the time to finish this later anyway !

\[SFX : Chair moving\]



Speaker (stretching) : Hmmmm...Ah ! I’m starving !

Speaker : I think I deserve a snack !



Speaker : Hm hm hmm..

(…)



\[SFX : Fridge opens\]



Speaker : Hmm...There’s gotta be a slice of flan left in here somewhere...Ah ! There it is !

Speaker : I’m so hungry ! I can’t wait to-

\[SFX : Listener lets go of the door, soft crash\]



Speaker : Uh ?

Speaker : Is...is someone there ?

(…)



Speaker : Helloo ?

Speaker I...I’m warning you, I’ve got a wooden spoon...and..I’m not afraid to use it !

\[SFX : Door creaking\]



Speaker : You ! Who...Who even are you !

Speaker : Don’t take me for a fool ! I can see you ! So answer me, who are you ?

(…)





Speaker : Wow..That’s..actually a really nice name !

Speaker : Well, nice to meet you I’m-

Speaker : Wait. What am I saying ? Your name doesn’t matter !

Speaker : What I really want to know is, how did you even get in here ?

(…)



Speaker (quiet) : I don’t understand… I always make sure to lock the door…

(…)



Speaker : So, tell me, how did you find this video- ehm...I mean, this..place ?

(…)



Speaker : You..just clicked ? And ended up here ?

Speaker : Hm.

(…)



Speaker : Oooh...Right. I think I get it now !

Speaker (quiet) : But still, that’s odd… People don’t usually come here…

(…)



Speaker : Okay, listen. Normally, I’d kick you out without a second thought…

Speaker : But honestly, you look even more lost than I am.

Speaker : And well, no offense, but you don’t look very threatening.

(…)



Speaker (quiet) : I mean, aside from the « breaking into a stranger’s house » part…

Speaker : But you know what ? If you’re there, there’s probably a reason !

Speaker : So, I guess you can stay a bit.

\[SFX : Footsteps\]



Speaker : I was just about to take a little snack break ! Want to join me ?

(…)



Speaker : Great !

Speaker : Oh, don’t just stand there, come on, sit down !

\[SFX : Chair scraping lightly\]



Speaker : Look at this flan ! Isn’t it beautiful ? Want some ?

Speaker : Oh, but don’t worry ! If you don’t like it, I’ve got plenty of other sweet treats you can try !

\[SFX : Cutting dessert, forks\]



Speaker : And...Would you like tea with that ? Coffee maybe ?

(…)



Speaker : Perfect !

Speaker : There you go.

\[SFX : Stirring a spoon in a cup\]



(…)



(...)



Speaker : Ehm...Are you okay ?

Speaker : You’ve gone really quiet all of sudden…

(…)



Speaker : Oh, sorry ! I...I didn’t mean to stare !!

Speaker : I’m really sorry ! I’m just...Hm..

\[SFX : Sips some tea\]



Speaker : You see...Looking at you a little closer...I think I know what you are.

Speaker : You’re a..uh...what’s the word again…

(…)



Speaker : A viewster ? No wait...A watcher ?

Speaker : Oh ! Of course ! A Listener ! That’s what you’re called, right ? The one who listen…

Speaker : Yeah, I’m sorry, I’m terrible with theses terms sometimes.

(…)



Speaker : Hm hmm. Well nice to meet you dear Listener…

Speaker (over the top tone) : Welcome to my lair ! A place beyond time, filled with magic, mysteries and-

Speaker (laughing) : Yeah...no..I can’t do that seriously. I’ll leave the big speeches to the real narrators !

Speaker : Let’s just talk normally, okay ?

(…)



Speaker (thinking) : Hm, so you’re a Listener. Got it !

Speaker : You must be used to this kind of thing, uh ?

(…)



Speaker : I knew there was something different about you… Like you don’t really belong here…

Speaker (quiet) : That’s strange. This is the first time I’ve actually met one of you.

(…)



Speaker : You must have met a lot of people before you got here, didn’t you ?

Speaker : Were you looking for a specific roleplay ? Maybe a bit of fantasy ?

(…)



Speaker (teasing) : Oh… Sounds like you had some fun…

Speaker : Now, I’m curious… Who did you meet before me ?

(…)



Speaker : Let me guess… An Arachne ? A vampire ? Maybe a flirty elf ?

Speaker : Or perhaps you prefer romantic tales, with princes et princesses ?

(...)



\[SFX : Speaker laughs at the Listener’s response\]



Speaker (laughing, amused) : No, no ! It’s...it’s fine !

Speaker : I’m not judging ! Everyone has their thing !

(...)



Speaker (more calm) : You...You can listen to whatever you want !

Speaker : I was just curious to know who you met...

(...)



\[SFX : Spoon stirring\]



Speaker : Well, all that sounds really fun.

Speaker : But you know… You should be careful when hopping from one roleplay to the next.

Speaker : You might not notice, but you leave behind traces. Or more like...You carry them with you.

(…)



Speaker : You would not know because you’re not from here, but I can see it. It’s like...a magical dust, clinging to you. It builds up the more you wander too far from reality.

Speaker : You’ve got quite a bit right there, on your shoulders. Here...don’t move.

\[SFX : Fabric sounds, fairy dust\]



Speaker : Oh ! Don’t worry ! It’s nothing too dangerous.

Speaker : But it can mess with your experience here.

Speaker : And if you jump from one world to another too quickly, it might cause...ripples.

(…)



Speaker : That’s why you should take breaks between adventures, you know ?

Speaker (amused) : Though, I get it… Meeting all those fantastical creatures and charming characters, it must be tempting to keep going non-stop !

(...)



Speaker : But still, be careful, okay ?

Speaker : Good.



(…)

(…)



\[SFX : Puts down cup\]



Speaker : Hm…

Speaker : You’ve gone quiet again… Think about something ?

(…)



Speaker : Oh… Who...am I ?

Speaker : Well...uhm..you can call me \[VA name / or choose a name\]

Speaker (quietly) : Not that it matters much…

(…)



Speaker : As for my role here...Let’s just say I create some of the stories behind theses roleplays you wander through.

Speaker : Oh but I’m not the only one doing that !

(…)



Speaker : Well, it’s hard to explain…

Speaker : But let’s say, I’m part of a team that builds different worlds Listeners visit. We stay in the background but we keep things running smoothly. Kind of like...backstage guides, I guess.

Speaker : Though, usually we’re not really supposed to meet Listeners like this.

(…)



Speaker : Hm ?

Speaker : Wait, what ? Did...Did you think I was a witch / wizard / mage ? Me ?!

Speaker (playful) : Well, I don’t know… Do I look like one to you ?

Speaker : Maybe I am… Or maybe I just have a thing for pointy hats ! Who knows…

(…)



Speaker : Anyway ! It’s nice meeting someone new once in a while...Even if they show up uninvited.

(…)



Speaker (amused) : No, no, don’t worry ! I’m not mad at you !

Speaker : This...has actually been kind of lovely, hasn’t it ?

(…)



Speaker (quiet) : I’d almost forgotten how nice it is to talk to someone…

Speaker : Listener...Why...Why don’t you stay here a bit-

\[SFX : Bell, magical chime



Speaker : Oh…

Speaker : Well...Looks like our little moment is coming to an end.

(…)



Speaker : Yeah, that’s tends to happen. These words don’t stay open for long, especially this one.

(…)



Speaker : But...You know what ? I’m glad you xame here. Even if it was probably just an accident.

Speaker : I hope this place gave you a little peace. You know, a moment to rest your mind.

(…)



Speaker : I’m glad I could help you, even a little !

Speaker : Real life can be exhausting sometimes.

Speaker (smiles) : I get why you guys spend so much time in these roleplays. It...lets you breathe a little.

(…)



\[SFX : Magical chime again\]



Speaker : Oh…

Speaker : Guess I’m talking too much again.

Speaker : Looks like it’s time to say goodbye.

(…)



Speaker : Hm ?

Speaker : Will...Will we meet again ?

(…)



Speaker : Hm. I have no idea ? I’m not around here too often.

Speaker : But who knows, maybe our paths will cross again.

Speaker Or maybe not !

(…)



Speaker (amused) : Either way, I’m really glad I met you.

Speaker : Oh...And don’t forget what I told you okay ?

Speaker : Take breaks sometimes. Between roleplays, or just in general.

(…)



Speaker : Take care of yourself.

Speaker : And next time ? Maybe knock before walking in !

\[SFX : Magical chime\]



Speaker : See you around…

Speaker : Dear Listener…

(…)



\[SFX : The world fades shut\]

The first thing Tyler saw when he opened his eyes was the gallery ceiling — white, wide, and humming with too much light.

The second was Sasha.

She sat on the floor beside him, back against the wall, legs pulled up like she’d been there a while. Her hair was messy from worry, and her fingers were stained with dried paint and smudges from trying to help. She looked exhausted.

But she was still there.

He groaned, shifting, and instantly regretted it. His knee screamed, his stomach turned, and the pounding in his head reminded him just how badly he’d screwed up.

She looked up fast. “Hey. You’re awake.”

He managed a weak, dry laugh. “Sorry for being the world’s worst employee.”

“Not quite,” she said softly. “We had one guy glue a sculpture to the floor last year.”

Tyler’s lips curved. “Give me time.”

Sasha didn’t smile back. She just watched him, eyes dark and worried. “Tyler, I need to get you home.”

“You don’t—”

“You’re not walking on that leg alone,” she said firmly, already standing.

He tried to argue, but the effort it took to sit up left him breathless. Swallowing his pride along with the shame, he let her loop her arm under his.

They didn’t speak much on the walk — or, more accurately, the limp — back to his flat. The pain had dulled to a background hum, and the meds had burned off just enough for the guilt to set in. He hated being seen like this — weak, broken, dependent. It wasn’t who he was. Or, at least, it wasn’t who he used to be.

Once inside, Sasha helped him to the couch, hovering until he gave her a nod that he wouldn’t collapse again.

His apartment was small and mostly bare — a couch, a beat-up coffee table, a record player he hadn’t used yet. The walls were empty, his suitcase still half-unpacked. It didn’t feel like home. Nothing had, since he left Michigan.

“You should sit,” he mumbled, gesturing to the only chair.

She ignored him and headed to the kitchen instead. “Do you have tea? Or food? Something that won’t make your stomach worse?”

“I’ve got ramen and a half-eaten protein bar.”

She opened a cabinet and found exactly that. With a small sigh, she filled a mug with water and set it to boil.

Tyler leaned back on the couch, rubbing a hand over his face. “You don’t have to do this.”

She turned to him, arms crossed, eyes unreadable. “I know I don’t. But I am.”

Silence hung between them, thick with all the words neither had the courage to say.

Finally, he spoke, his voice hoarse. “I shouldn’t have taken that many. I wasn’t trying to… you know. I just… I didn’t want to look weak.”

“You didn’t,” she said quietly.

He laughed bitterly. “I collapsed in the middle of an art gallery.”

“And still tried to joke about it afterward,” she said, stepping closer. “That’s not weak. That’s stubborn. And maybe a little stupid.”

He smiled, even though it hurt.

She placed the mug of tea beside him and sank into the chair. “You should talk to someone. Not me — someone real. A doctor. A therapist. A person who knows what they’re doing.”

He looked at her then, really looked — the gentle strength in her posture, the worry in her eyes, the lines of paint still smudged on her arm. She didn’t belong in his mess. And yet, she was sitting right in the middle of it.

“I’m sorry if I scared you,” he said.

“You did,” she admitted. “But I scare easy when I care.”

That stopped him cold.

Sasha blinked, realizing what she’d said, but didn’t take it back.

Neither of them moved.

The tea cooled. The sky outside darkened into inky black. A single lamp lit the room with a soft yellow glow.

At some point, Sasha tucked her feet up into the chair and curled into herself. They talked — not about the pills, or the past, but about art and cities and why neither of them really felt at home anywhere right now. He told her about the rink in Kalamazoo where he used to sneak in after hours, just to skate in silence. She told him about how painting sometimes felt like screaming without having to explain the words.

It was nearly one in the morning before either of them noticed the time.

Sasha glanced at her phone, eyes going wide. “God. I should go.”

Tyler sat up slowly. “Right. Yeah. Of course.”

She stood but didn’t move right away. Her gaze lingered on him, something softer now. “Will you be okay tonight?”

“I’ll be fine,” he said. “I’ve got water. I’ve got tea. And if I get desperate, I’ve got very stale ramen.”

She gave a small laugh, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Text me. If you need anything.”

He nodded.

And then, before he could second-guess it, he reached for her hand. Just a brush of fingers.

“Thanks, Sasha.”

She squeezed back.

Then she was gone.

The door clicked softly behind her, and Tyler sat in the silence, staring at the place where she’d been.

He’d made it through worse days.

But this one — this one had changed something.
And the worst part?

He wasn’t sure if he was terrified… or relieved.",1,1750105903.0,u_SeanWil69,0,1.0,False
1ld3udu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ld3udu/davy_harwood_by_tijan_she_had_been_my_roommate/,"Davy Harwood by Tijan: She had been my roommate for the last three months. Her entire life plan was written in detail with bulleted expenditure costs, but it all revolved around her career choice in social work. She was the one to volunteer at the hotline. She was the one who dragged me there. She..","**CHAPTER ONE**  
Mr. Moser is not happy.”  That was my greeting as I dropped my books on the library table and plopped down next to my roommate. She was the originator of my stupid hotline volunteer career. The career that was finito, done, and over with. I snuck inside that morning, slipped the envelope underneath the door, and bolted.  There are occasions where I’m very much a coward, and this was one of those times. I’m not surprised,” I muttered and bent to grab a pencil out of my bag. The location of the bag was just opportune. It was on the floor so I was able to turn and present my back to my roommate. I hoped she’d take the hint. “What do you mean you’re not surprised? Why aren’t you surprised?” Emily hadn’t taken the hint. Then again, she never did.  She had been my roommate for the last three months. Her entire life plan was written in detail with bulleted expenditure costs, but it all revolved around her career choice in social work. She was the one to volunteer at the hotline. She was the one who dragged me there. She was even the one that pointed out Adam. Emily wasn’t the reason why I stayed. Adam was that reason.  I like boys. Most people would say that I’m boy-crazy, but the truth is I just find them entertaining. I would never ever kill myself over a guy. They’re not worth that much, but they are worth a fun activity or a cuddle during a movie. When I saw his rich chestnut hair and almond eyes, I knew that Adam would make a great movie-cuddler.  
  
  “Davina!” Emily called out sharply. She was being ignored. That made her pissy.  
  
  I sighed and fought the urge to bury my head in my book. No. Why fight it? I buried my head into my book and groaned dramatically. I knew one thing. It would make Emily shut up. If there was one thing that made her uncomfortable, it was when someone was in need of emotional reassurance. I once saw her spill a drink and use that as an excuse to leave a group when one of the girls started crying. I highly doubted Emily’s social work career would make it past the paper it was written on, but I wasn’t going to be the one to tell her.  
  
  On another note, I hated being called Davina. It’s Davy. It’ll always be Davy. It’ll never be Davina. Then I realized there was silence. Emily had quieted. I risked a look, and saw that her eyes were downcast on her own pile of books. I thanked my own quick wits for this reprieve.  
  
  “Davina.”  
  
  I stiffened at the name, but when I looked over my shoulder I melted into a gooey feeling inside. Adam was approaching with an eager stride. His almond eyes sharpened with warmth, and I saw the earnest grin on his face. Tall, dark, and just pretty. That’s how I’d describe my perfect guy, and Adam easily fit the bill. Plus, he wore Abercrombie. What girl didn’t like that? Well, probably a lot, but it looked yummy on him.  
  
  “Hi, Adam.” I was warm. I was always warm around him.  
  
  He stood at the end of our table and seemed riveted by me. I wondered why and then let it go. Obviously, the guy had woken up and realized his love for me.  
  
  I heard about the suicide last night. Are you okay? You were there, right? That’s what Shelly said.”  
  
  Shelly. All the gooeyness dried up. Shelly was my competition. I cheated on my empath rules and took a peek inside her once. The feeling was mutual. She hated me even more and I didn’t need to be psychic to know that she planned to murder me.  
  
  I was only joking…somewhat.  
  
  I was a short girl at five foot six inches with an average build, not slim, but not big either. I had brown curls on a good day, and a frizzy fray on a bad, but I knew my dark brown eyes and my full lips were my best features. Guys liked to stare at both of them, but Shelly was a tall willowy blonde with absolutely beautiful blue eyes. I always felt like I was swimming in a lake when I looked at them.  
  
  Shelly liked Adam. I liked Adam, but I wasn’t sure who Adam liked.  
  
  “What else did Shelly say?” I couldn’t hide my sarcasm.  
  
  Adam’s smile dimmed slightly, but he pressed, “Is it true? You answered the phone and she was on the roof?”  
  
  The boy was goal oriented. “Yes. I was there, but she jumped.”  
  
  Emily looked up with wide eyes. Adam shifted a little and his eyes skirted from me to Emily. “Are you… are you okay? Shelly said that you quit the hotline.”  
  
  Emily harrumphed.  
  
  “Um…”  
  
  “I can’t believe you quit.” Emily had to put her two cents in.  
  
  “Yeah, I mean…” Adam took the seat next to mine and lowered his voice. It was soothing and seductive to my ears. “I mean…the place won’t be the same without you, you know?  Of course I knew, but that was the point of it. I wanted to get as far away as possible. It would always remind me of the girl from last night. I wasn’t freaked out with agony and so forth, but the truth was that I was freaked out by the gut-wrenching feeling that something worldly awful had happened and that it was connected to me. “I just… it’s too much, you know? I can’t handle—she died in front of me. I can’t…it’s just too much for me.”  
  
  I saw the sympathy in Adam. He placed his hand on mine. “I know exactly what you mean. If you ever need anything, call me. Okay? I want to help you through this tough time.”  
  
  Emily fled the scene. I almost caught a back draft from her sprint. “I’d really like that, Adam.”  
  
  He squeezed my hand. “Any time. Remember that, Davina.”  
  
  I’d remind him another time not to call me that name.  
  
  Then the happily-ever-after feeling was gone as I felt a vampire walk past us. A cold wind slapped my insides and I looked up. Normally, vamps ignore me. They can’t feel me like I can feel them so they just believe that they’re not noticed.  
  
  Not this time.  
  
  I gasped when I saw a pair of coal-black eyes staring right back at me. The vamp was tall with jet black hair. He wore a white buttoned-down shirt over jeans. He kept going, but I still felt his eyes after he turned the corner.  
  
  “Davina,” Adam said sharply, confused.  
  
  “What…what were you saying?” His hand was gone. I wanted his hand back.  
  
  “I…” He frowned again and asked, “Are you okay? You pushed me away and I mean, that’s okay if that’s what you need right now. I just thought…” He trailed off and looked away.  
  
  I didn’t have to be empathic to see his insecurity. “It’s not that. That guy scared me just now. I’m sorry. I want your help, I really do.”  
  
  His eyes twinkled.  
  
  I sighed again. How could any girl not fall in love with how adorable he was?  
  
  “Can you two stop with the sappy moment?” Emily returned with a storm at her backside. She slumped in her seat. “I’m trying to study.”  
  
  “Oh, yeah,” Adam laughed, a little embarrassed. “I-uh—I’ll talk to you later, Davina?”  
  
  I nodded. Hell yeah, we’d talk.  
  
  “Good. See you later then.”  
  
  I glanced at Emily as he left and saw her sharp green eyes on me. She narrowed them in disgust.  
  
  “You make me sick.”  
  
  “What? Why?” I was innocent.  
  
  “You totally lied to him just now. I had to run to the bathroom to keep from barfing. Really?! You can’t handle it? She died in front of you? Mr. Moser told me that you need to get back to the hotline. You broke protocol and that’s why you quit, not because you’re ‘emotionally shaken.’ Seriously, Davina.”  
  
  Maybe my roommate knew me a little better than I realized.  
  
  “Can you blame me?! Adam is to die for.” I could not believe I just said those words.  
  
  “I can’t believe you said that.” Emily reiterated my thoughts.  
  
  I flushed, embarrassed, and leaned back in my chair. “What am I supposed to do? I didn’t quit because of protocol, okay? And I need any advantage with Adam. You know Shelly Whistworth has her claws in him.”  
  
  Emily was annoyed. “You have to go and talk to Mr. Moser. You did break the rules and he’s worried about a lawsuit. And Adam Darley is not worth your time to lie and lower yourself. If he’s a stand-up guy, he’ll recognize that you’re much more fun to be with than Shelly Witless. If he’s not and he goes to her, he’s not the guy that you’ll want anyway.”  
  
  “I’m not lowering myself,” I remarked, and crossed my arms. “I’m just being manipulative.”  
  
  Emily looked at me knowingly. “Well, stop. It’s annoying.”  
  
  “It’s fun.”  
  
  Emily opened her mouth and started to say something, but I felt the blast of cold race through me. My heart slowed as the vamp walked towards me from the opposite direction. His eyes were on me again. He seemed to look right through me, but he didn’t slow his pace. He walked right past.  
  
  I hated vampires. I knew what they could do from personal experience. However, there were a lot of good vampires that liked to hang out on campus. Some of them even took classes and wanted to learn. This guy looked like a regular college student and he walked like one. Right to the computer lab, and back out again for a Mountain Dew. Typical college behavior, but I was betting he wasn’t one of the ‘good’ vampires.  
  
  “Do you know who that is?”  
  
  “You interrupted me. I was talking.”  
  
  I watched as he returned from the vending machines and sat back down at a computer. “That guy. Do you know him?”  
  
  “We’re at a school with six thousand students. Really?! We’re freshmen, Davina. How can you expect that I’d know him?”  
  
  I turned and regarded her. “Do you know him or not?”  
  
  She shifted uncomfortably in her seat.  
  
  “Who is he, Emily?” I leaned closer and hoped he couldn’t hear us. There were two glass walls between us and the computer lab always buzzed with conversations and printing papers. If he tuned in, he could hear us, but for once I hoped that I wasn’t a speck on this guy’s radar. Correction—make that this vampire’s radar.  
  
  “He’s in my social work class.”  
  
  “Intro?”  
  
  “Yeah. He’s a junior and he’s fulfilling a requirement.” She sounded like she’d practiced that. Something felt off with her. She liked to share her opinions on people, but she didn’t with this guy.  
  
  “You like him.” I couldn’t fault her. Vamps had seductive appeal down to perfection. Emily was a girl. Even she would fall under their power whether they intended it or not. The only way you could fight against their pull is if you knew what they were.  
  
  “I do not!” Emily cried out. She started to gather her books back up, but I laid a hand on them.  
  
  “It’s okay. He’s dreamy. I understand.” I glanced back over, but sighed in disgust.  
  
  He just sat there at the computer. His hands didn’t move on the keyboard. “Who is he?” I asked again, still watching the back of his head.  
  
  He sat rigidly.  
  
  “Luke Roane,” Emily sighed. She’d be mortified at how dreamy it sounded.  
  
  “Roane?” I arched my eyebrows.  
  
  What kind of name was that? I’d heard of a Roane back home, but the name was only spoken about as a legend. Most of the vamps didn’t believe he existed. I didn’t like this new twist. My college life wasn’t supposed to deal with supernatural things like this. I wanted an Adam in my life, not a vampire named Roane.  
  
  “He’s really intelligent.” Emily had opened her floodgates. Now her opinions flew freely. “He cares about the world and he’s got some super insights into humanity.”  
  
  I bet he did.  
  
  “Even Professor Sulls asks his opinions on matters. Luke’s like no other guy that I know. I mean, I respect him. I have really high standards and I only respect two other guys,” she said, casually.  
  
  “I know.” I said dryly, “Jesus and Martin Luther King Jr.”  
  
  “Can you believe it?” Emily sighed again. She was on the fast track for her first college love crush. It was my little name for those crushes when a girl thinks she’s in love. They were annoying… to everybody.  
 Love crushes aside—or maybe front and center—I hadn’t moved my eyes off Roane’s back, but then my eyes slid past his shoulders to his black computer screen. I found myself staring smack head-on with him. I gasped in mortification. He’d been staring right at me the whole time. This was not good, not at all. He knew that I knew. I knew that he knew I knew. I could’ve pretended that I didn’t know he was listening to us, but now all bets were off.  
  
  He’d seen.  
  
  I smiled smugly and whispered, “I know what you are.”  
  
  His face didn’t move. His eyes didn’t react, but I knew I’d made him angry.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  I called my empath sponsor and planned to meet her for coffee. When I pushed through the glass doors of Coffee Java, I inhaled the freshly brewed aroma and felt like I’d just touched a piece of heaven.  
  
  Blue looked up and waved an arm from a back booth tucked into the corner with bookcases and empty tables surrounding it. I liked how private it was. Blue got her name for her graying hair that she dyed with blue highlights. She liked that it gave her an out-of-this-world quality although she was very much an earthly woman. Every one of the bracelets jangling on her wrist stood for a cause – pollution, cancer, save the forests, happiness from an orgasm.  
  
  I smiled widely as I weaved my way through the book cases. “Blue-cheese, how are you?”  
  
  She laughed with her raspy deep-throated voice. “That never gets old.” Nudging forward a coffee, she added, “Take it. You know it’s for you.”  
  
  I nabbed it and closed my eyes when the liquid touched my lips. It was so good, so yummy, and I knew I really was in heaven.  
  
  She closed the novel she’d been reading and pushed it to the side. She wasn’t one for idle talk. “Okay, girl. Out with it.”  
  
  “I have a problem.”  
  
  She arched a perfectly outlined eyebrow and rested her chin on her hand.  
  
  “I have vamp problems,” I said further.  
  
  Understanding dawned in her grey eyes. All empaths understood that statement. Sometimes we felt too much, but when we felt a vampire our senses went haywire from what they felt. “Are you still practicing your blocks?”  
  
  I nodded. I’d upped my level since I joined the hotline.  
  
  “That’s good. Keep at it. Now, tell me about the vamp problem.”  
  
  What could I say? “It’s nothing really, but a feeling. He saw me in the library today with my roommate. I asked her about him and he heard the whole thing.”  
  
  Blue frowned. Her purple lips rubbed together. “What’s the problem? Vamps are used to that.”  
  
  “I was watching him when I asked her about him. I didn’t realize that he’d been watching the entire time.”  
  
  “What do you mean ‘watching’?” She narrowed her eyes.  
  
  “He knew that I knew what he was. It was like a challenge or something. I didn’t like it.”  
  
  “Oh, girl.” Blue frowned deeply this time. “What’d you do?”  
  
  I took a sip of my coffee, but the flavor didn’t taste heavenly anymore.  
  
  “Girl.”  
  
  “I might’ve said something like ‘I know what you are’ …or something.”  
  
  She pursed those purple lips together and reached for her coffee. I felt her disapproval coming at me in waves. “You did what?”  
  
  “I couldn’t help it, alright? It was like he was challenging me or something.”  
  
  Blue sat her coffee down and leaned forward in a matronly way. “You know better, Davina. You have issues with vampires. We all do, but you’ve got more. You gotta fight that. Now what’s gonna happen? You know vampires. They love challenges. He’s going to be all over you now. Then what? How are you going to get away?”  
  
  In a small voice, I murmured, “I could always do what I did before.”  
  
  Blue let out a disgusted sound and rolled her eyes. “I would not recommend lighting a vampire on fire. It didn’t help you back home. It won’t help you this time. Learn from your mistakes, child.”  
  
  My back stiffened at that. I hated being called Davina and I really hated being called ‘child’. “You know, maybe moving here and having you so close isn’t all that great.”  
  
  “I’m being your sponsor. You know the steps. If you’ve got vamp problems, you’ve done step one. You’ve told me. Good job, but you need to be held accountable for the next step. Which is?”  
  
  She knew I knew it, but I cringed when I had to say it. “I have to attend an empath meeting.”  
  
  “And?”  
  
  “And...,” This was so freaking hard. “…I have to tell the group.”  
  
  “About?”  
  
  I growled deep in my throat. “I have to tell them about Craig and how I lit him on fire because he was stalking me.”  
  
  Pride gleamed from Blue and she smiled blindingly. “That’s my girl. You know the deal. Vampires have their twisted thing for us. The good ones avoid us out of respect and the bad ones—you know more than most.”  
  
  I swallowed tightly. Craig had reveled in my torment. He’d become obsessed with me. He stalked me and he loved that I couldn’t block him. Vampires were overpowering, much more so than humans. An empath could easily block humans at a level four, but it wasn’t until level six that we could easily block vampires. Craig met me when I was on level five. Luckily, the night that I’d snapped and lit him on fire was the night that I broke to level six. I remembered that night. I saw him on fire and I remembered the pain that engulfed him while I stood back to watch.  
  
  “Girl.” Blue’s calming voice brought me back. She had opened herself up and I could feel some of the pain taken from me.  
  
  “Don’t do that,” I murmured huskily. I didn’t want her to feel my pain. No one should be burdened with that.  
  
  She reached over and placed a hand on mine. It instantly calmed me and I turned my palm upwards to link our fingers. Blue smiled gently. “There’s a reason why we’re empaths, Davy. You know that. I like to help a little bit, every now and then.”  
  
  ‘Every now and then’ was the empath community’s motto. We all learned that we could help every now and then, but not too much to kill ourselves. Too many had died because they tried to help too much.  
  
  “Now,” Blue squeezed my hand. “What are you going to do with your current vampire?”  
  
  “Oh…” I took a deep breath. “I don’t know. I’ll have to see what kind of vampire he is. He might be one of the good ones.”  
  
  Blue twisted her lips in disbelief.  
  
  “I mean, he seems to be one of the student vampires.” The chances were fifty-fifty. The bad ones pretended to be college students to hunt.  
  
  “There’s a meeting next week. You should go.”  
  
  I’d have to go — it’d be good for me.  
  
  “So, tell me about your crazy uptight roommate.” Blue’s eyes rekindled with gentleness. She knew I needed a lighter topic. The ‘Craig topic’ was deep enough for me. So I sat back and entertained her with Emily stories. By the end of our meeting, I hadn’t said a word about the suicidal girl. I knew I should have, but I was still uneasy thinking about it. Some things were too hard or too scary to put into words.  
  
  When I returned to campus that evening, I faltered as I got out of my car. The air was chilled, but there was something else, something supernatural in it. Looking over my shoulder I only saw a parking lot full of cars. There was a clump of trees at the north end of the lot, but I’d go south to my dorm. I held my breath as I walked underneath two tall oaks and an arched overhang that led into the quad of my dorm.  
  
  Throwing my bag over my shoulder, I marched forward. No shadows moved and none seemed to watch me in return. I breathed easier when I neared the main doors. Once inside, excited voices came from the television room.  
  
  We were allowed boy visitors, but a lot of girls used the lounges for their study groups. It wasn’t unusual to look inside to see books and papers sprawled across the beige carpeting right alongside sleeping students. This is what I saw as I peeked inside, but I wasn’t ready for the sight of my roommate in a corner chair with a wistful smile on her face. She glowed.  
  
  I was floored. There was no Roane. There was no professor. There were no school books and yet, Emily glowed. Her straight blonde hair fell freely over her shoulders and she even had a tint of lip gloss on. Had we all gone to hell and I missed the bus?

Yesterday, my girlfriend and I broke up. It hit me harder than I thought it would—last night and this morning—despite us only being together for three months.

Everything seemed to be going great until our last date on June 7th. I noticed she was distant and rejected any intimacy during and after when we got back to my place. Then on June 9th, she sent me a text while I was at work. She shared that she felt insecure about my feelings toward her after opening up and admitting she might be falling in love with me. She said she didn’t think we spent enough time together, even though we went on dates twice a week despite our work schedules not aligning. She even mentioned my Instagram follows, which caught me off guard. I reassured her that Instagram is just noise to me—that I don’t compare anyone there to her, nor do I compare myself to others. I told her if she felt things weren’t working, we should talk about what’s best for both of us.

We ended up meeting for coffee and lunch after my morning run yesterday. Everything was going perfectly—the intimacy was back. I met her at her place, kissed and held hands walking to the coffee shop, grabbed lunch at a restaurant we both enjoy and then back to her place. For the last half hour, things were going smoothly, but then she wanted to talk about the text again—and that’s when I knew it was over. We spoke honestly, and my goal was to end things amicably because I never wanted her to feel like she couldn’t open up to anyone in the future. I told her she could toss out the hoodie she borrowed if she wanted, but she kept it and said, “I never did anything wrong to her.”

We held each other in her bed before I couldn’t take it anymore and had to leave. When I was leaving, she offered to wait for my Uber downstairs. I accepted the offer as I knew this would be the last time I'd see her.

While waiting on her steps, we embraced and she rubbed my chest as she always did for comfort, both of us knowing this wasn’t going to happen beyond today. She also said, “Never stop being a gentleman,” before I left. I couldn’t look back as I walked down the steps and into the car.

Before we parted, I told her I wanted the best for her—that I want her to meet someone who can give her the love she sought from me. I also told her to be careful with her heart because it’s pure, not to let a man take advantage of that and thanked her for coming into my life when she did. 

Despite only a few months together, she broadened my horizons, allowed me to really be me and I’ll remember her for a long time. I told her that the moment I saw her walking down the street toward the restaurant, I knew I had to knock it out of the park so I could see her again and I did because when she talked about working for a minor league baseball team, I named the team without even knowing which part of the state she was from. She blushed, and I could tell right then something special was happening.

What’s stayed with me most since leaving her place was our conversation about the things we see in each other and the one final kiss I gave her on the forehead.

I loved her wit, sense of humor, silliness, her cooking skills, and how easy it was to talk to her. Once we learned what we liked physically, the intimacy was electric.

But it’s the little things I will miss—the good morning texts (I was looking at my phone anticipating one), the surprise visits to her work, seeing that smile on her face when she left the store with coworkers watching curiously before kissing and embracing her.

I had even planned a date for us this week—tickets to a Mets game. It wasn’t just about the game. It was about sharing a part of myself with her. She knew how much I loved watching the Mets—she’d seen the memorabilia in my apartment and watched games with me. I wanted her beside me, not just because I liked her, but because it felt like letting her further into my world. Like saying, this is a piece of who I am, and I want you to be part of it.

I don’t want to erase our memories. One of my favorites is from our second date. There was a photo booth at a bar—we kissed during the picture. She took the bottom half—the part where we were kissing—and I took the top half, where we were smiling. I still have mine. She still had hers too—she showed it to me during a visit not long ago. That moment mattered to both of us.

That night was when she first invited me to stay over. It was the first time we shared a bed—not just physically, but with a kind of closeness and comfort that made the room feel softer somehow. That photo and that night are stitched together in my mind. They’re where the deeper connection really began.

She said she wanted spontaneity—the kind of whirlwind romance you see in movies: surprises, grand gestures, constant newness. But with where I am in life, I couldn’t always give her that. As a caregiver, my circumstances required stability. She also said she wanted to be lovebombed—to feel swept up in something bigger than herself. And while I understood that longing, she knew early on that wasn’t how I loved. What happens if that feeling fizzles out?

I’m someone who loves with consistency. With presence. With quiet reassurance. I affirmed her in words and actions. When we were out, there was never a doubt she was my girl. I gave what I had, and I gave it honestly.

I know she felt something real—she told her grandmother about me. And that mattered. I just needed a little more time to meet her where she already was.

It wasn’t perfect. But it was honest. It was meaningful. And it was real.

Now I’m here—still being myself, still feeling the ache of it. I know time will move things forward, but today, it just hurts. I cried last night and I cried this morning while at work.

I’m working again. Slowly rebuilding. I’m doing what I can to change the things within my control—my living situation included.

She brought something out of me I thought I’d lost. A softness. A spark. The part of me that still believes in connection, in timing, in second chances. And even though it was only a few months, she showed up right when I needed someone most. I was literally starting my life over. I began a new Marketing role after being out of work for over a year. I lost everything I had built and had to rebuild everything from scratch. My confidence, sense of purpose and joy were all gone. Hope, tenderness and excitement returned to my life and I didn't realize how much was buried until she helped me feel full again. I have nothing bad to say about her. I truly wish her well. While I didn't fall in love with her as quickly as she did with me, she will always have a piece of my heart.

My parent gave me a bunch of second hand things for my apt (that they also pay for) I’ve been using the items. 

Just to quickly summarize my parent is abusive towards me, tells me where I can and can’t go, what I can and can’t do. They’ve yelled at me, called me names, and have a lot of put downs to me. 

Looking at the items they gave me, makes me feel bad. 😞 I can’t even cook without thinking half my stuff is theirs. I went to make coffee, and my coffee pot is broken, and the coffee is even the type they got me, and the mug I use is from their wife who calls me fat and lazy, and puts me down. 

I just laid down, on the second hand sofa, on their old used out pillows, and I literally feel so depressed. Then I remembered Reddit.

I’m not going to leave the apartment, or throw anything away, because I literally don’t have the money too. But can anyone else sympathize with me this is draining?

My wife is going to wean them when they turn 1, which I’m so excited for. Breastfeeding has never done her any favors hormonally. So I’m hoping things start to improve a bit then? Who knows.

Babysitting is rough for our families… they’re good kids, but they’re too much for one person to watch on their own if they’re not accustomed to it. Heck, I don’t think my wife has ever watched the three of them by herself for more than an hour or two.

I’m happy for her and it’ll be a good experience that I think she needs, but doing this solo for that long… yikes.

Hi Reddit,
Please be brutally honest. I’m  Rhia 27 working at a mid-sized company, and my manager—let’s call him Zain is around 15 years older, married, and very reserved. Over the last several months, something has developed between us that I can’t fully explain, and it’s really messing with my head.this has been going on from 14 months

There’s been no outright flirting or anything inappropriate, technically. But emotionally? I don’t know anymore.

Here are some of the moments that have stood out:

He gives me lingering, unreadable looks. Especially when I walk into a room unexpectedly. Sometimes he physically pauses like he’s been caught off guard. His body tenses, like he didn’t know how to react to just seeing me.

During team meetings, he’ll speak to someone next to me but look at me—with this kind of charged gaze. If I don’t speak up, he’ll wait and then nudge the topic toward me again indirectly. Like he’s trying to draw me in without calling on me by name.

Once, I purposely pulled back—didn’t engage much, stopped messaging updates directly, kept everything formal. After a week, in front of the whole team, he casually said, “Rhia doesn’t speak much these days,” with this pointed smile. I didn’t know how to respond. It was small, but it stung.

Another time, I left my bottle in his cabin. A couple of hours later, while I was walking out of office with colleagues, he literally stopped his car, honked, rolled down the window, and told me I forgot it. In front of everyone. My colleagues were like “???” and I had no explanation.

During casual moments—like when we’re both waiting near the coffee machine—he’ll suddenly go into soft, thoughtful mode. ""You have that training now, right?"" or “Your batch is smaller than the last one.” Things that aren’t work-necessary, but sound like he's been observing.

One of the most confusing things: he gave me an incredible performance review during my mid-year check-in. I mean, glowing. Far more than I deserved. I know for a fact that I messed up a few deliverables, turned in one project late, and was pretty inconsistent. But in the review, he used words like “outstanding potential,” “reliable,” “attention to detail,” and “impactful presence in the team.” It almost made me feel guilty reading it.

Once, while I was talking about a collaborative project with a male colleague from another department, Zain casually said, “Ohh, so you’ve got time to chat with your friend these days. Good, building connections, I see.” He said it with a smile, but it felt like a dig. A weirdly jealous one.

He’s also extremely cautious when it’s just us—he’ll keep things short, almost like he’s trying to be professional—but it feels performative. Like he's scared of being seen, but still wants the moments.


I haven’t done anything intentionally to invite this. But I also haven’t exactly pushed it away. The problem is: I’ve started to enjoy it. I know that’s not okay. I’m ashamed of it. I feel seen in a way I haven’t before—but it’s from someone I have no right to be seen by.

So Reddit, please tell me honestly:

Is this emotional cheating?

Why is he doing this if he’s married?

Is this my fault too for not pulling away more aggressively?

And how do I emotionally distance myself from something that never even officially began?


I never wanted this. I just came here to work hard, grow, and earn. But now I feel like I’m in this grey emotional spiral with someone I shouldn’t be connected to at all. Please help me sort through this mess.

Tbh, I'm kind of digging having good clean meals like plain salted chicken or fish with veg everyday...after going through intense stomach pain of greasy and spicy foods","When I started on 7.5mg, I started getting an awful upset stomach which were very painful. I was throwing up and had really bad diarrhea + constipation. One night I had the most awful stomach acid, it honestly felt like my belly was on fire and I kept having to spit out the corrosive feeling saliva. (Haha yes this post is a bit grim but I'm sure there are many who can relate.)

I was absolutely beside myself as I could no longer eat the type of foods I liked - which was generally spicy and greasy foods, and the odd Magnum, and coffee.

Then I after doing some research (on here), to stop feeling ill, I had to stick to bland foods. So bananas (which I have for breakfast now). Then plain chicken breast and fish filets with either rice or potatoes, and veg, for dinner. At first, it was a bit annoying and I was kind of upset that I couldn't eat a good old spaghetti bolognese, curry or even throw a little spice on my chicken breasts. Roast potatoes even made me feel bad, and I bloody love those!

But then I started to enjoy my meals more and more. I bloody love a fish supper now. It's so clean, light and full of flavour. I actually look forward to eating that meal every day. I just feel so good and fulfilled after eating.

Plus, crisps and magnums are mostly gone from diet. If I need a snack, I'll have a few crackers or roast chestnuts. It feels like a far cleaner way of living. A real lifestyle change.

I'm 5'9, male, and have gone from 15st10 to 13st11 in three months and two weeks. 

I'm delighted with that even though it's felt so slow. (Was that good progress?) My belly has slimmed down and much of the face fat has disappeared. The face fat really haunted me as I looked like such a different person to my old self. Now I feel more like me again. (I put a lot of weight on in the space of like two years)

It wasn't until 7.5mg until I started getting ill. Before then I was still pigging out on shit food. So I am very relieved it worked out for the best as there were some scary moments and I often still feel uncomfortable in my stomach...but I feel like myself again.

The only annoying thing is not being able to drink alcohol any longer. I never used to drink that much anyway but enjoyed a night out every now and again.

So is this now my life forever with bland foods?

I honestly don't really mind. Missing out on those old foods is a small price to pay to feel attractive again.",14,1750105168.0,mounjarouk,22,0.94,False

**Posted by** [u/DVD\_Victim](https://www.reddit.com/user/DVD_Victim/) **- 6 days left**

Okay, so I know the title sounds insane, but hear me out. I'm writing this because I'm genuinely terrified and I don't know what else to do. I need advice, or maybe just someone to believe me.

About three three weeks ago, I was rummaging through some old boxes in our attic and found this dusty, unmarked DVD. Curiosity got the better of me, and I popped it into our ancient DVD player. The screen flickered, and then it was just... static. For a long, unsettling minute. I was about to eject it when the static warped, and this *thing* started to emerge.

It wasn't a glitch. It was a woman. Her skin was marble white pale, almost translucent, but with a sickly, damp sheen to it, as if she'd been submerged in stagnant water for years. Her jet-black hair was impossibly long, matted and stringy, a dark, silken curtain that seemed to move on its own, swaying and swirling as if she were perpetually submerged in a sewer. She was clad in an old, tattered, and dirt-stained white nightgown, the fabric barely clinging to her slender frame, ripped open in places to crudely expose her **ample bosom**. Her body was unnervingly slender, yet with an unsettling, predatory grace. Her face, despite the silent, gaping scream contorting her features, was eerily pretty in a decaying way, a chilling beauty that made the horror even more profound. But her eyes... her eyes were just bottomless black pits, devoid of any light or humanity, yet somehow brimming with malicious glee. And she wasn't just on the screen; she was *crawling* out of it, her movements slow, deliberate, and disgustingly wet, like a spider emerging from a dark, slimy hole. I swear to God, she was physically manifesting in my living room, dripping thick, murky, brackish water onto our carpet, leaving dark, spreading stains.

I froze. My blood ran cold, a block of ice in my veins. She just stood there, the air around her growing heavy and cold, thick with the stench of rot and damp earth. Then, her voice, a raspy, gurgling whisper that sounded like dead leaves skittering across concrete, like something ancient and broken, filled the room: ""You will die in 30 days."" Her lips barely moved, but her voice seemed to ooze from her very pores.

I screamed. A raw, guttural sound I didn't know I could make. I don't remember much after that, just scrambling to turn off the TV, ripping out the DVD, and throwing it in the trash. I was a shaking mess for days, huddled in my room, trying to convince myself it was a hallucination, a nightmare. But the image of her, the sound of her voice, the *smell* of her, was seared into my mind. I kept replaying it in my head, and then it hit me: *The Ring*. That movie where you watch a video and then die in seven days unless you show it to someone else. My curse was 30 days, but the premise was chillingly similar.

The first few days were a blur of panic and denial. I tried to convince myself it was a hallucination, a nightmare. But then, the countdown began. Not just in my head, but around me. I'd wake up to find ""29"" scrawled in condensation on my window, the numbers dripping down like tears, blurring into grotesque shapes. Or ""28"" would appear briefly on my phone screen when it wasn't even unlocked, a pixelated omen that glitched and writhed before disappearing. The woman herself started to appear. First, just glimpses in reflective surfaces – a fleeting shadow in the mirror, a ripple in a glass of water that wasn't there a second ago, a distorted face in the polished surface of my desk. Her long, dark hair would be the first thing I noticed, like ink spreading in clear liquid, then the pale, unsettling flash of her skin, always just out of focus.

But it wasn't just the direct encounters. It was the *knowing*. The suffocating certainty that she was always, *always* there, a constant, vile presence. I'd catch myself staring out my window, and sometimes, across the street, near the old oak tree, I'd see a flicker of white, a splash of jet black hair against the dark bark. She'd be standing perfectly still, just watching my house, her head cocked at an unnatural angle, like a broken doll. Other times, I'd glance into my own yard, and there she'd be, standing by the rose bushes, her head tilted slightly, those black pits of eyes fixed on my bedroom window, a faint, predatory smile seeming to stretch her decaying lips. Even when I couldn't see her, I *felt* her presence, a cold pressure on the back of my neck, the subtle, cloying scent of stagnant water and something vaguely metallic in the air, even indoors. It was like being in a fishbowl, constantly under surveillance, every moment of my dwindling life observed, her unseen gaze a tangible weight.

I tried everything to get rid of that damn DVD. I threw it in the kitchen trash, burying it under coffee grounds and food scraps, hoping the stench would somehow deter it. The next morning, it was sitting on my dresser, perfectly clean, gleaming under the morning light, mocking me with its pristine surface. I tried to burn it in the backyard fire pit, dousing it with lighter fluid. The flames licked at it, roaring, but the plastic didn't even char, just shimmered faintly, completely unharmed, almost *enjoying* the heat. In a fit of desperate rage, I took a hammer to it, smashing it against the concrete driveway with all my might. It shattered into a dozen pieces, the plastic flying everywhere, and I felt a surge of fleeting relief, thinking I'd finally done it. But when I looked down, the pieces were slowly, impossibly, drawing back together, reforming into a perfect, whole disc right before my eyes, clicking and grinding with a sound that made my teeth ache. It was back on my dresser again by the time I got inside, sitting there, waiting. Nothing worked. It was inescapable.

The dread became a physical weight, pressing down on my chest, making it hard to breathe. Every breath felt shallow, every sound a potential harbinger of her arrival. I started jumping at shadows, my nerves frayed beyond repair. My parents noticed I wasn't sleeping, that I'd lost weight, that my eyes were constantly bloodshot and wide with terror, but I couldn't tell them. How do you explain a ghostly woman crawling out of a DVD? They'd think I was insane, or worse, send me to some shrink who'd just medicate me into oblivion while the clock ticked down.

By day 27, the encounters became more direct, more terrifying, designed to shock and repulse. I was getting ready for school, pulling a shirt from my closet, when a sudden, icy gust of wind swept past me, smelling of stagnant water and old dust, but also something sharp, like ozone and bile. I looked up, and there she was, *lurching* out of the utter darkness of my closet, her marble-white face inches from mine, those black eyes staring, utterly devoid of emotion, yet somehow filled with a perverse glee. Her tattered gown hung loosely, completely exposing her **voluptuous curves**, almost thrusting them forward, and a strange, sickening mix of fear and something else – a fleeting, unwanted fascination that made me feel like a total pervert – twisted in my gut. I know, I know, it's weird. Who gets *that* from a literal ghost trying to kill them? But I'd never seen a naked woman before, and in her own eerie, ghostly way, she was kinda pretty, if you could ignore the death and decay. Still, she was terrifying, and I knew she'd rip my face off if she got the chance. She didn't move, just *existed* there, her body swaying almost imperceptibly, the scent of damp earth and decay filling the air, making me gag. I stumbled back, hitting the wall, my heart hammering against my ribs, convinced I could feel the cold radiating from her exposed skin. She vanished as quickly as she appeared, leaving only the lingering cold and the putrid smell.

The next day, day 26, I was heading downstairs, trying desperately to avoid thinking about her. As I reached for the banister, a cold, clammy hand shot out from under the bottom step, wrapping around my ankle with a sickening grip. It felt like a dead fish, yet incredibly strong, its fingers digging into my flesh. I yelped, my foot slipping on the polished wood, and I nearly went tumbling down the entire flight, only just managing to catch myself. I yanked my leg free, my breath ragged, and stared at the empty space under the stairs, convinced I saw a faint, dark swirl of her hair receding into the deeper shadows, and heard a faint, wet chuckle. Later that evening, while I was trying to do homework, the light in my room flickered violently, then died, plunging me into darkness. I looked up, and her face, distorted and elongated, seemed to form in the glare of my computer screen for a split second, her mouth opening in a silent, grotesque scream, before vanishing. The air went frigid, and I heard a faint, wet *thump* from inside the walls, like something heavy and waterlogged was moving just out of sight, dragging itself through the plaster.

By day 25, the whispers started. Faint, breathy sounds that seemed to come from just behind my ear, even when I was alone in my room. ""25... 24..."" each number a chilling reminder, like a morbid lullaby, but laced with a wet, sucking sound, as if she was speaking through a mouthful of mud. I stopped sleeping. Every creak of the house, every rustle of leaves outside, sounded like her. I'd sometimes feel a cold, damp touch on my arm or the back of my neck, a sensation like cold, slimy fingers, but when I spun around, there was nothing. Just the lingering chill and the phantom touch. Her presence was like a suffocating blanket, always there, just out of sight, yet undeniably *present*, a constant, repulsive weight on my soul.

Then came day 24. I woke up with a start, not from a nightmare, but from a profound, suffocating weight on my chest. My eyes snapped open, but I couldn't move. My limbs were locked, paralyzed, pinned to the bed by an invisible force. The room was dark, but I could make out a shape above me, a pale, indistinct form. As my eyes adjusted, the horror solidified. She was on top of me. The ghostly woman, crawling onto my bed, her slender body pressing down, pinning me. Her long, wet hair draped over my face, smelling of stagnant water and decay, tickling my nose. I could feel the cold, clammy weight of her. Her tattered gown, soaked and transparent, was pressed against my bare chest, and I could feel the distinct, chilling sensation of her **sizable tits** flattened against my skin. They were cold, like marble, but with a strange, rubbery texture, and I could feel the hard, pointed nubs of her nipples pressing into me, sending an electric jolt through my body. The terror was absolute, paralyzing me, but then, a horrifying, shameful jolt shot through me. Despite the overwhelming fear, despite the knowledge that this was a harbinger of my death, a perverse, unwanted arousal stirred within me, a sickening mix of dread and illicit excitement. I got an erection, it popped up right between her legs, I could feel her thighs pressing against it, enveloping me.  It was sick, I knew it, a total weirdo thing to feel, but her nakedness, her cold, unholy intimacy, ignited something primal and deeply disturbing. Her black, vacant eyes were inches from mine, staring, and I could feel her cold breath on my face, a whisper that seemed to come from inside my own head: ""24... days..."" Then, as quickly as she appeared, the weight lifted, and she was gone, leaving me gasping for air, shaking uncontrollably, and utterly disgusted with myself.

Then came day 23. I was in the shower, trying to wash away the constant feeling of dread, scrubbing my skin raw. The steam filled the small space, and for a moment, I felt a fleeting sense of peace. Then, a cold, heavy pressure against my back, a sudden, sickening intimacy. I froze, every muscle tensing, my heart leaping into my throat. The water suddenly felt icy, as if the pipes had burst with glacial runoff, and I could feel the distinct coldness of her body pressing against mine. I could feel the soft, clinging fabric of her gown, now completely soaked and transparent against my skin, revealing the full, pale outline of her slender body beneath. Her chilling cold, marble-white form was pressed against me, the sensation of her unnatural temperature seeping into my very bones, making me shiver uncontrollably. My breath hitched. Slowly, agonizingly slowly, I turned my head, and there she was, standing right behind me, her black eyes fixed on mine, her impossibly long, matted hair streaming around her in the water, looking like dark, tangled seaweed. Her eerily pretty face was inches away, her lips slightly parted in what looked like a silent, mocking laugh, as if to whisper another number. The sight was horrifying, yet my eyes were drawn to the stark visibility of her **prominent mounds** through the wet fabric, deliberately exposed, a detail that sent a jolt of both terror and a deeply unsettling, almost shameful, awareness through me. I knew it was messed up, a total weirdo thing to notice, especially since I was about to die and she was a literal demon, but it was the first time I'd ever seen a woman naked, and she *was* strangely beautiful in that ghostly, decaying way. Still, the overwhelming feeling was pure, primal fear. She was a monster, and I knew she'd rip my face off if she could. I screamed, scrambling out of the shower, slipping on the wet tiles, my erection flailing, my heart trying to beat its way out of my chest. She just stood there, unmoving, watching me, her black eyes seeming to expand, before slowly fading into the steam, leaving behind only the cold and the lingering scent of her foul presence.

Sleeping became a nightmare in itself. I'd drift off, only to snap awake, my eyes darting around the dark room, my body drenched in cold sweat. More often than not, she'd be there. Not always right next to me, but sometimes standing in the corner, her head tilted, those black eyes boring into me, a silent, predatory hunger in their depths. Other times, she'd be at the foot of my bed, her marble-white skin glowing faintly in the dark, her hair swirling around her like a dark cloud, almost reaching me, and I could feel the cold radiating off her like a physical force. I'd pull the covers over my head, but I could still feel her presence, the cold seeping through the blankets, the faint, damp, repulsive scent of her. I knew she was there, just watching, waiting for the clock to run out, enjoying my terror. The nightmares were vivid, too. I'd be drowning in murky water, her face appearing just above the surface, whispering the countdown, her breath bubbling with slime. Or I'd be trapped in a dark room, and she'd be crawling towards me from every shadow, her limbs impossibly long, her body bending at unnatural angles, her tattered gown revealing more and more of her decaying form with every lurching movement.

I had 22 days left when the desperation truly set in. I couldn't live like this. Every shadow looked like her, every silent moment was filled with her impending arrival. The constant fear was eating me alive, stripping away my sanity piece by piece. And then a terrible, desperate idea formed in my mind.

There's this girl at my school, let's call her ""Tiffany."" Tiffany has made my life a living hell since middle school. She's relentlessly bullied me, spread rumors, and generally made me dread going to school. I know it's messed up, but in my panic, I thought: *What if I could pass it to her?*

I retrieved the DVD from the dresser (it was back, of course, mocking my futile attempts). I made up some excuse about finding a ""rare horror short film"" and convinced Tiffany to come over after school to watch it. She was skeptical but her ego got the better of her, thinking she was too tough for any horror.

We settled down to watch it, Tiffany with her usual smug smirk, me with my stomach churning. The static filled the screen, and I could feel Tiffany's initial boredom slowly morph into unease. Then, the distortion, the flicker, and *she* began to emerge. Tiffany's smirk vanished, replaced by wide-eyed horror. Her jaw dropped, and a low, guttural gasp escaped her. The woman crawled out, dripping and vile, her eyes fixed on Tiffany now. Tiffany screamed, a high-pitched, terrified shriek, and stumbled back, tripping over her own feet, collapsing onto the floor with a pathetic *thump*. Before she could even scramble up, the ghostly woman, with a horrifying, fluid motion, *crawled* right on top of her, pinning her to the ground. Tiffany thrashed, her eyes wild with terror, but she was completely helpless, just like I had been. The woman's cold, wet body pressed down, and her tattered white shirt, already damp from Tiffany's sweat, became instantly soaked, clinging to her skin. I could see Tiffany's **generous chest** clearly through the now-transparent fabric, her puffy pink nipples, barely there, hardening from the cold and terror, pressed against the ghost's own decaying form. The woman's face, inches from Tiffany's, stretched into that predatory smile, and her raspy whisper filled the room, directed solely at Tiffany: ""You will die in 30 days."" Tiffany let out a choked sob, and I saw a dark stain spread rapidly across the front of her jeans. The woman then lifted herself, her black eyes sweeping to me, and gave a faint, satisfied nod before vanishing.

I felt a pang of guilt, but mostly, relief. I thought I was free.

That relief lasted about 24 hours.

The next morning, I woke up with a knot in my stomach. The number ""21"" was etched into the fog on my bathroom mirror. My heart sank. She was still here. And then, Tiffany showed up at my door, looking like she hadn't slept in days. Her usual confident swagger was gone, replaced by a trembling, pale mess. She was sobbing, hysterical, saying the woman was haunting her too. ""She's everywhere!"" Tiffany shrieked, pointing at a faint, dark smudge on my wall that only I could see now. And then she said the worst part: the woman's whisper had changed. Now, it said: ""You *both* will die.""

The shared curse was almost worse. We were both terrified, constantly looking over our shoulders. We'd call each other in the middle of the night, both of us seeing her, both of us hearing the whispers. Sometimes, she'd appear to us simultaneously, standing between us on a video call, her face flickering in and out of existence, her black eyes fixed on us both. We'd tried everything we could think of – burning the DVD (it wouldn't burn, just like before), smashing it (it just reformed), burying it (it reappeared on my doorstep). Nothing worked. The woman's appearances are almost constant now. She's not just in reflections; she's standing at the foot of my bed, her marble-white skin glowing faintly in the dark, her hair swirling around her like a dark cloud. Sometimes, her face is inches from mine, those black pits of eyes staring into my soul, and I can feel her cold, foul breath on my cheek. The whispers are louder, clearer, more mocking: ""7... 6... 5..."" Tiffany says she sees her too, often in the exact same spot, as if the woman is a shared hallucination, a collective nightmare. We've tried staying awake, but exhaustion eventually wins, and she's there, waiting, enjoying our terror.

It was during one of our frantic, late-night calls, probably around day 3 or 4 of the shared curse, that I finally cracked. Tiffany was sobbing, describing another terrifying encounter with the woman in her own bathroom, and I blurted it out. ""It's not just scary, Tiff,"" I mumbled, my voice barely a whisper, ""it's... it's messed up. When she's close, and... and I see her, like, really see her, it's... I know it's gross, and she's trying to kill me, but... I've never seen a girl naked before. And she's kind of... in a totally creepy, ghostly way, she's actually pretty. And it makes me feel like such a weirdo, because I'm scared out of my mind, but there's this other thing, too."" I trailed off, expecting her to hang up, to mock me even in our shared doom.

There was a long silence on the other end, broken only by her ragged breathing. Then, a sniffle. ""You're serious?"" she asked, her voice surprisingly soft. ""You're telling me you're getting... *aroused* by the death ghost?""

I groaned, burying my face in my hands. ""I know! It's disgusting! I hate it! But yeah, sometimes. Especially when she's really close, or like, in the shower...""

Another silence. Then, a strange, almost thoughtful sigh from Tiffany. ""Huh,"" she said. ""Well, that's... definitely weird. But I guess... I guess we're both in a weird situation, aren't we?"" A moment later, my phone buzzed. A notification from our chat. I opened it, my heart pounding, and saw a series of images loading. Naked selfies. Tiffany. Just... Tiffany. The first one was a mirror selfie, her phone held up, showing her full body, slightly blurry but undeniably her, her face a mix of defiance and vulnerability. The next was a closer shot, from the waist up, her arms crossed over her chest, but her **ample chest** still prominent, her puffy pink nipples, barely there, visible through the slight blur. Then another, lying on her side, a shy, almost sad expression on her face, her body curved, her stomach flat, her legs slightly bent. And then, the last one. A clear, stark photo, well-lit, of Tiffany, spread eagle, her legs wide, looking directly into the camera, a mix of fear and strange resolve in her eyes. Every detail was visible. ""Maybe this will help you focus on the living, you pervert,"" her text read, followed by a shaky laugh emoji. My jaw dropped. This was Tiffany. My bully. Sending me *naked selfies* because we were both about to die. The world had officially gone insane.

The next few days blurred into an even more intense nightmare. The ghost wasn't just *appearing* anymore; she was actively toying with us, her malice palpable. We'd be on a video call, trying to brainstorm solutions, when the screen would suddenly glitch, and her face would fill it, distorted and stretched, her black eyes seeming to bore into our very souls. Sometimes, she'd appear *behind* one of us in the reflection of the screen, a pale, silent observer, her long, wet hair swaying, before vanishing with a ripple that wasn't quite a visual effect.

One night, I was trying to eat dinner, forcing down bland food, when the lights in the kitchen flickered wildly. The air grew heavy, and the distinct smell of stagnant water filled the room. I looked up, and there she was, standing in the doorway, her head tilted, her **heaving chest** prominently exposed through her tattered gown. She didn't move, just watched me, a faint, wet chuckle echoing in the silence. My fork clattered to the plate. I stared, paralyzed, as she slowly raised a hand, her long, pale fingers beckoning me, her lips parting as if to say something, but only the sound of water dripping, *drip, drip, drip*, filled the air. She held the pose for what felt like an eternity, her black eyes never leaving mine, before she simply *dissolved* into the shadows, leaving behind only the oppressive cold and the lingering stench.

Tiffany had a similar experience the next day. She was in her living room, scrolling through her phone, when her TV suddenly turned on, blasting static. Before she could react, the ghost crawled out, not towards her, but towards the TV remote, picking it up with those long, clammy fingers. Tiffany screamed, scrambling away, as the ghost slowly, deliberately, pressed the power button, turning the TV off. Then she dropped the remote, her black eyes sweeping over Tiffany with a look of pure, mocking disdain, before she too vanished. It was like she was showing us how utterly powerless we were, even over the simplest things.

The whispers became constant, not just counting down, but taunting. ""Tick-tock... not long now..."" or ""Such pretty bodies... soon to be cold..."" They were always just at the edge of hearing, designed to chip away at our sanity. We started avoiding being alone, even going to the bathroom became a terrifying ordeal. The fear was a constant, gnawing beast in our stomachs.

We're both terrified. We're 17. We don't want to die.

So, AITA for trying to save myself at someone else's expense, only to make things worse for both of us? More importantly, **WHAT DO WE DO?!** Any advice, no matter how crazy, is welcome. Please. I'm desperate.",1,1750105143.0,HorrorTalesCommunity,0,1.0,False

A barista from Japan, beating out 84,000 competitors worldwide. His prize? Fame, glory, and the chance to launch his own drink on the Starbucks menu: the *Blooming Yuzu Espresso*.



But the real plot twist was on Starbucks’ job board: they’re hiring a **Global Coffee Creator**, aka a full-time Starbucks influencer. Applications closed today, but it’s basically the coolest gap year ever. One existing barista and one TikToker will get a 12-month, all-expenses-paid gig traveling to Starbucks locations around the world — from Reserve cafes in Milan and Tokyo to the coffee farm in Costa Rica. Flights? Paid by Delta. Hotels? Courtesy of Marriott. Your job? Tell the story of Starbucks — with a selfie stick and a ring light. Applicants had to post a TikTok explaining why they deserve the job and tag u/Starbucks, turning the application process itself into a marketing campaign. It’s equal parts creator gig, brand stunt, and caffeinated dream job.



**The Takeaway: Starbucks is inventing a new role — the in-house influencer.**

Just like some lawyers go in-house for stability and better hours, content creators now have that option too. Freelance influencing can be chaotic — income depends on brand deals, and burnout is real. But in-house influencers? That’s one brand, one mission, and one (predictable) paycheck. Starbucks is one of the first major companies to formalize this role, but they won’t be the last. As brands look to connect directly with consumers through relatable, scroll-stopping content, expect more companies to add “resident creator” to the org chart. Starbucks isn’t just hiring someone to drink coffee — they’re building a content engine, from seed to espresso shot.

I’m  working in the medical field and belong to desi background. It’s been a bit of a whirlwind settling in, and I’m hoping to meet new friends to explore the city, grab coffee, or just hang out and talk life.

I enjoy good conversations, trying out different cuisines, and long night walks (especially if there’s good weather). Would be great to meet fellow expats, locals, or anyone open to making new friends.",1,1750105075.0,Needafriend,2,1.0,False

my hand in her other, 

and I swear the morning sun waits

just to grace her face 

She hums off-key in the kitchen,

burns the toast,

laughs at the smoke like she knew this would happen, yet she's so unbothered by it

She folds the laundry like she’s
placing rain into clouds

soft, thoughtless movements

that feel like home.

No diamonds, no grand entrances,

just chipped mugs and mismatched socks,

and the way she looks at me

like I’m something that she always wanted. 

She doesn’t try to be beautiful.

with her undone hair, tired eyes,

she makes the driest days smell like it just rained

and the way she listens, like the world

only speaks through me

she didn't arrive as something I would see coming

she crept in with the quiet mornings

shared playlists,

and her changing her clothes, 

as I pretend not to stare.

And if I ever forget what love is,

I'll think of her

in sweatpants,

asking me if it's okay if she uses the shower 

Because that,

that's where my forever lies

1ld3gva,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ld3gva,I need advice for repairing this damage,"I picked up this cabinet for next to nothing in the hopes of using it for a coffee bar. I knew it was missing the legs and had some scratches, but felt good about building legs and disguising the scratches. The problem is I didn’t notice what appears to be a peeling layer of veneer from potential water damage along the top of the cabinet face. Has anyone ever fixed something like this before? I was considering trying to carefully peel that layer, cleaning up the surfaces, and then gluing them back together.",1,1750105022.0,woodworking,2,1.0,False
