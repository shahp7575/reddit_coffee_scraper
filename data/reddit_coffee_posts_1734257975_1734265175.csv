Hello All,

Was hoping for some insight.

Have recently started getting brief spells of tachycardia during the immediate cool down after physical activity. For example if I briefly run, then once I stop running, a minute or so later as my heart slows and returns back to normal it races again, and usually for around 10-20 seconds.

This can be quite intense, and even after walking it occurs. So definitely limiting and unnerving. I can usually stop it by forcing a yawn - it does seem sometimes it is related to how I am breathing before it starts. 

I saw my doctor and she has suggested 3 day holter and in the meantime to take flecainide. This has worked in terms of suppressing it but I don’t like the idea of being on this long term.

I am 46m with history of AF. Exercise a lot, 5-6 times a week so reasonably fit. Take medication for blood pressure and cholesterol (runs in family). When this started I was in the middle of a dry spell in terms of booze and hadn’t drunk anything for a month, so wasn’t like that or coffee caused the stimulation.

Any ideas or thoughts on this eg cause for concern, why it has started, ideas on treatment etc would be good.",1,1734264710.0,Heartpalpitations,0,1.0,False

*My name is Mike, I’m a 23 year old guy working at a coffee shop in a small village, but this doesn’t matter anyway. I just want to tell you what happened before I jump off this cliff. It all started last week. I woke up, had a quick breakfast, then wanted to go to work. There was a big storm outside, so I even took my umbrella.*

*As I got out of my house, I noticed it wasn’t just water raining. People were fucking falling from the sky. One landed right next to me, his head basically disappearing from the impact. My heart almost stopped before I ran back to the house and sat near my window, watching the outside world like some kind of maniac.*

*The storm lasted another five hours. I didn’t even call my boss to tell him I was not coming in, I’m sure he saw the events as well. I went outside again. Bodies were everywhere. Hundreds of them. Maybe thousands. Nobody else was outside. I could understand this, probably everyone was scared, and would rather stay in their house.*

*Then I looked at the dead bodies. Some of them were so mangled from the fall, I couldn’t even recognize them. But some of them were my neighbors. That’s why nobody from the neighborhood was outside. They were all dead.*

*I spent the rest of the day wandering around the village, trying to find any survivors. There were none. I even called everyone I’ve ever known in my life. I found the corpse of my boss on the top of his house. There was no logical explanation for how this could’ve happened. Every fucking person in the village was dead, except me. There was no tornado, as far as I’m aware.*

*No news stations were talking about the events. I had no idea what to do next. It was already late at night when I got home. Walking back to my house was terrifying. Terrifyingly silent. No cars, no people, nothing. Something wiped out the whole village, except me. I thought I wouldn’t be able to sleep, but luckily, I was so tired I fell asleep in a few minutes.*

*The following morning, it was another big storm. And as I looked outside the window, I was shocked. People were falling from the sky again. At first, I thought the wind picked up the dead bodies from the day before, and was throwing them around again, but when a few hours later I went outside, there were twice as many bodies.*

*But something was strange. Every single one of the corpses was male. That wasn’t the case on the first day. And every one of them had black hair. Just like me. I was thinking about stealing a car and getting out of the village to seek help, or maybe an explanation. It wouldn’t be stealing anyway, as everyone here is dead. But I just wasn’t able to drive, the emotional trauma from these events prevented me from focusing.*

*The following week, the storm continued. It started every morning around 7 AM, sometimes only lasting an hour, and sometimes it went on until midnight. Every day was the same. More and more bodies started to pile up on the streets and in my yard. Lots of times I heard the falling bodies hitting my house.*

*The national news didn’t say anything about what was happening, I didn’t find anything about it on the internet. But then where were the bodies coming from? The whole village was dead on the first day of the storm, but a week later there are still hundreds of new bodies falling.*

*As the days went on, the bodies started to look more and more like… me. It was so uncanny, I just basically grabbed as much food as I could from the empty store, and hid in my house. Weeks went by like this. Every day, I was thinking about ending it all. And when I didn’t have any more food left and went out again, I froze as I stepped out of my door. Every dead body looked like me. And they weren’t just similar. They were exact copies of me. Like clones, or twins of me.*

*After I was able to overcome the initial shock, I decided to finally grab a random car and drive as far as I could from this hell. I grabbed my now dead neighbor’s car, and drove as fast as I could.*

*I drove two hours before I reached the nearest city. When I finally arrived, I quickly found a parking lot, then quickly jumped out of the car, I was so happy I could finally see living people. But…*

*They all looked like me. They looked at me like I was crazy. But they were all copies of me. I ran away. Now I’m here, standing at the edge of this cliff. I hope someone will find this recording and solve this mystery. I won’t.*  
*Audio recording ends*

Fascinating, isn’t it? It’s amazing how can a brain alone can imagine a whole life for itself, and how easily it could turn into a nightmare, after some small electrical impulses. Although it’s an interesting subject, I find these experiments unethical, and I don’t want them to continue. But nobody listens to me. I shared this because I want people to know about the experiments. Maybe a negative public opinion can convince them to stop.

Ever since then I feel she stopped being interested in spending time with me. Previously we would see each other ever week or once in two weeks at minimum, sometimes we would see each other every day in the school library (we are both students at the same university) and go hang out for lunch or coffee. Now we  hardly meet at all. We don't spend time together at the apartment, no common lunches, breakfast or anything. I have tried reaching out to her several times and always got rejected, while she does not reach out to me at all.

A month ago, I have tried to have a conversation about this with her, saying that I feel like our friendship has become onesided and asking whether there was some sort of issue with the co-habitation. She admitted not putting in any energy but claimed it was because she was busy and strugggling financially (she has recently started at new job and was still in the unpaid training) but promised to put in more energy. During that conversation she has invited me to join her and her boyfriend at a concert. I went and it was lovely but ever since then the friendship went back to the previous stage of me reaching out to be rejected and her never reaching out.

I find her claim that she is not reaching out merely out due to lack of time and money odd because I see regularly her ig stories in which she goes out to party with her other friend or her boyfriend and I know that she has recently planned a Christmas trip with a group of friends to a city in a foreign country and I know it is rather expensive to travel there.

Step right up to the Museum of Microscopic Worlds, where biology throws on a beret, smokes an imaginary Gauloise, and declares, “Call me avant-garde!” Today, we're taking a deep dive—not the kind you’d get at an overpriced aquarium, mind you—into the mind-blowingly beautiful chaos lurking within your cells. Yes, *your* cells! Those little biological worker bees that tirelessly keep you from collapsing into a puddle of existential dread and expired memes. Imagine these tiny powerhouses as art installations so captivating even the ghost of Picasso would mutter, ""Why didn't I think of that?""

Now, before you roll your eyes and mutter about mitochondria being the overhyped “powerhouse” influencer of bio-nerd TikTok (it’s true, it’s a cliché), hear me out. Cellular structures are basically nature’s finest avant-garde artists. Cytoplasm? That’s Jackson Pollock on an existential bender. Ribosomes? They’re the IKEA of biology, assembling proteins like flat-pack furniture—only without the soul-crushing instructions. And mitosis? Oh, darling, that’s pure performance art!

Let me take you on a tour of this hypothetical museum, where the only thing smaller than the exhibits is your attention span.

First stop: *Cytoplasm Splatter Art*. This masterpiece is like throwing paint at a wall and calling it ""deep,"" except the paint is molecular chaos, and the wall is your life! Picture it: suspended globules of proteins and enzymes swirl around in a gelatinous goo, like a lava lamp that accidentally joined a punk band. It's a living Jackson Pollock, people! One second, it’s producing energy molecules; the next, it’s breaking them down—because why wouldn’t it be both the arsonist and the firefighter? And just to up the drama, cytoplasm is *always* in motion. It’s like the Kardashian family but with purpose! I mean, how does one fluid compartment juggle so many roles? Move over, multitasking apps—cytoplasm is the original overachiever.

And before you ask, yes, there’s an audio component to this exhibit: a chaotic mashup of dubstep beats and elevator music because science is nothing if not unnecessarily eclectic.

Next, brace yourselves for *Organelle Sculptures*! If you thought modern art installations were just pretentious piles of metal rods labeled ""Untitled,"" wait till you meet the Golgi apparatus. Oh, what’s that? You don’t know what a Golgi apparatus is? No worries—it’s basically FedEx for your cells, packaging and shipping proteins like they’re limited-edition sneakers. In our museum, this unassuming cellular hero is transformed into a dazzling, life-sized 3D sculpture, complete with conveyor belts made of LED lights and an interactive feature where visitors can “ship” molecular packages to other exhibits. It’s art! It’s education! It’s… slightly terrifying when you realize your body depends on this thing not screwing up.

Right next to Golgi, you’ll find a mitochondrion-shaped beanbag chair because, apparently, everything is “experiential” now. Sit on it, absorb its energy (metaphorically), and whisper your gratitude to the organelle that fuels your coffee addiction. Bonus points if you manage not to Instagram yourself mid-squat.

Oh, but the pièce de résistance? The nucleus! Displayed as a literal throne surrounded by a shimmering curtain of DNA strands. It's a regal nod to the boss of the cell—because let’s face it, the nucleus *is* the diva of the microscopic world. This throne pulses with light, simulating the transcription of RNA in real-time, accompanied by an operatic soundtrack that somehow manages to be both educational and deeply unsettling. If this doesn’t scream “[science education through art](https://sciencestyled.com/),” I don’t know what does.

Now, onward! Our next exhibit is *Mitosis in Motion*, an interactive animation that brings cellular division to life. And no, it’s not some dry, narrated educational video where a guy in a bad blazer drones on about anaphase. This is mitosis reimagined as a choreographed laser show, complete with EDM beats and dramatic sound effects worthy of a Marvel movie trailer. Visitors can step into a virtual reality headset and witness chromosomes aligning like they’re auditioning for *America’s Got Talent*. As the cell splits in two, you’ll find yourself cheering for cytokinesis like it’s the underdog in a boxing match. Will it separate those daughter cells? Of course it will—but not before some unnecessary slow-motion drama that rivals the *Fast & Furious* franchise.

And if all this sounds too scientific for your delicate artist sensibilities, fear not. We’ve incorporated plenty of distractions for the casual museum-goer who’s only here because the Wi-Fi at home is down. There’s a gift shop, obviously, where you can buy a coffee mug shaped like a lysosome (tagline: “Breaking things down since forever”). Or you can grab a tote bag with “Ribosome: Protein Factory Extraordinaire” emblazoned in Comic Sans—because nothing says “art” like intentional bad taste.

But here’s the kicker: This museum isn’t just a funhouse of biological whimsy. It’s a bridge—a wildly over-engineered suspension bridge—between art and science. Why? Because biology, much like art, thrives on interpretation. One person sees a mitochondrion and thinks, “Eh, energy production.” Another sees it and envisions a neon-lit rave in the underbelly of a sentient disco ball. Both are right! Science isn’t just about formulas and facts; it’s about the *why* behind the *wow*.

By displaying cellular structures and processes as art, we’re not just turning science into something visually stunning—we’re making it accessible, relatable, and maybe even meme-worthy. Imagine the viral potential of a TikTok featuring mitosis with captions like, “When you and your bestie split the check *and* the cytoplasm.” That’s the kind of educational revolution we’re talking about!

So, let’s shatter the outdated notion that science is boring and art is impractical. They’re not opposites—they’re frenemies at worst, soulmates at best. In the Museum of Microscopic Worlds, they collide, collaborate, and create something utterly unforgettable. Because if there’s one thing cells teach us, it’s this: even the tiniest components of life can make a colossal impact. And if they can do that, maybe—just maybe—we can too.

1heqyhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1heqyhg/nawala_na_ang_spark/,Nawala na ang spark.,"Hi, This is my first time asking and posting in this app so sorry in advance for any grammatical error or in the organization of my stories po.

So, I [M, 22], and i have a GF [F, 22]. She's my first girlfriend. We are both in the same college (education) program and also a graduating student na. We became official last year December po so we're already dating for a year.

Just a brief background po about us, I am a quiet or introverted type of guy, pero maingay to those who I'm close with. And, she is also the same or not? Kasi she's the type of girl na magiging close mo kasi marunong mag approach and nakikisama even to strangers, she just tend to be quiet sometimes. I have many likes and hobbies, such as music, movies, reading, and cooking. While her? Wala po. Though she also love reading, pero sa online po, sa mga fb pages (confessions, stories, etc.)

I met her during our 2nd Year. She's cute, and she's very kind kasi once before when i was buying a coffee and it was full of lurking humans, and as someone na medyo mahiyain pinauuna ko muna matapos bago ako, pero she approached me and told me na isasabay na rin niya yung sakin (she's with her friends that time) even though we're not close and don't have that much interaction except that we were classmates that time. I think that interaction made me like her or she caught my interest. I told my guy friends about it when we were talking about crushes or interest sa section namin. Then, weeks later, parang sinabi nila in a joke sa GC ng class namin na i like her. Kasi my friends want me to be with her kasi interesado raw ako sakanya, so they kept pushing me. Akala ko ayaw niya and she'll felt uncomfortable about it kasi naging ganun yung feeling ko at first, pero to my surprise hindi and parang sumasabay pa siya. Fastforward, we were talking na personally and in chats for months pero it was on and off kasi i was making sure sa feelings ko and her before i told her, then i began courting her last year October and we became official on December. We celebrate our monthsaries eating outside and giving each other gifts, and yun lang. I haven't done it with her kasi we're still in college and I respect her, only kisses and hugs palang. Legal siya sa family ko, pero ako hindi pa since hindi pa pwede sa father niya, yung mother lang yung may alam.

We're okay naman those months, there were just days na nag-aaway kasi I don't like chatting too much kasi madami rin akong gustong gawin. Nagkikita naman kami, and an update is enough for me kasi there is also a reason why. If we're in chat, it will always about her chismis/issues na nangyayari sa kanilang circle of friends or minsan naman sa academics, and family which is okay. I was fine with it at first, pero paulit-ulit lang. I thought it was a waste of time. Hindi rin naman kami makapag-usap personally and chats about hobbies kasi wala naman siyang hilig kahit music sa phone niya wala. I tried recommending her many times my fav. Ghibli movies and other U.S films, K-drama, pero di raw talaga siya mahilig. So when we're together, puro chismis and other pangyayari sa circle of friends nila yung talks namin. She invited me to join them pag may lakad kasi kasama rin daw mga bf ng friends niya. Pero i usually decline it kasi I don't feel comfortable around her circle kasi puro issues and when they resolve a misunderstanding puro social media agad parang di college and mature way to handle it, and I'd rather be with my own circle (our circle of friends are also in the same program with us). No chismises and just drinks and kwentuhan lang when together. She was fine with it kasi she's kind nga and puro friends lang naman kasama ko po. Pero there were days na hindi ako nakakapag-update for a day only, pero I'll inform her about it naman, and if not, then i will tell her my reasons after. This were just days na i don't have the energy to open social media and do nothing but lay down in bed kasi nakakapagod po (i hope you know that feeling).

These past days we're always together naman. She just have those fetish na mahilig sa kuko/fingernail? She likes holding my hands and caressing my fingernails kasi it's beautiful, kahit malaki daw ay parang pang girls kasi soft daw hindi parehas sa iba. Sorry for my words. I was okay with it kasi sinabi niya naman sakin before, pero sometimes it's just too much. Parang it made me lose my confidence a bit kasi parang 'yun nalang yung kino-compliment niya and not the person as as whole. Haha. Was it petty or weird to feel that way? 

If not for our academics talks, i think naghiwalay na kami before. Parang iyon nalang kasi ang bumubuhay every time when we're together. Now, I still like her, pero I can't confidently say na I love her. I want to have a relationship where both of us are comfortable, and can share each other's hobbies, and happiness. I don't like it when a person is more active in chismis than our personal interests. Though she's very kind and caring, I think the spark i felt from her before is fading. I once told her that it's better to break up kasi she deserves someone better, pero at the end of the day we always resolve it.

But now, it's different, I feel like a toxic person whenever i treat her like that. I thought that hobbies or similarities aren't that much important in a relationship, but now, I think it is. Is it wrong for me to look for that kind of love? If i really break-up with her, is there a way para hindi po siya masaktan ng sobra?",2,1734263107.0,OffMyChestPH,2,1.0,False

1heqv1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1heqv1x/got_rejected_by_a_potential_mom_friend/,Got rejected by a potential mom friend,"We moved to my husbands childhood hometown three years ago and I didn’t know anybody here. 

Last year I met a woman through my husbands work who is roughly my age, we have daughters born the same month (!) and my first impression was that we had a ton in common. We talked for a whole afternoon about photography, biking, yoga, and I felt like we connected and clicked.

Cue me imagining having a friend in this place. I imagined us meeting up to bring the kids to the nearby park, getting coffee, hanging out, maybe going to yoga classes together.

I feel stupid for imagining it now, but having friends with similarly aged kids is so important to me. I had a few back where we used to live, and it always did wonders for feeling cooped up and lonely with the kids. I even felt like we had so much in common that we could easily become friends regardless of the kids.

Anyway, we invited her and her family over for a bbq, I thought is was really nice, they invited us back one time, then a few months later I messaged her and asked if she wanted to go to the park/playground with our daughters. She politely declined, which is fine. People are allowed to be busy or just not feeling it.

It just dawned on me that that is almost one year ago and it’s been crickets from her ever since. Not a word. Which is FINE, she doesn’t owe me a single thing.

But I just got so sad about it. I don’t think I’d ever turn down and never following up with another mom with similarly aged kids for a little hangout just to get to know them, get out of the house and talk to someone who is also in the throes of motherhood. For me, declining and never following up, would mean I actively disliked that person. 

So in my rejection sensitive mind, the only explanation is that she must have actively disliked me. I wonder if I came across as too self centered, boring, annoying, something?

I got so excited to meet someone I thought I could really click with in this concervative small town, so it’s just extra painful to be rejected by someone who seems so much like the people I used to hang out with back home, you know.

Anyway, I know nobody owes me anything and people are probably just busy, it’s just fucking lonely and shitty sometimes.

I’ve tried to make weekly visits to show my support and simply to keep her company and hang out. A few weeks ago she asked me if I could design a Christmas themed drawing for a paint night she would be hosting at her coffee shop. I am a graphic designer but work full-time as a UPS driver which means I am busy around the holiday season, but for her I obliged. I worked and made a design for her which she loved, all we had to do was trace the drawing on to some canvases for her clients. Two days before the event she asks me “are you ready to teach?” Which I was baffled to read because I had no idea she also expected me to teach a painting lesson. The paint night was on a Thursday at 5 pm which meant I would no way be able to even assist the event. I told her I didn’t know she wanted me to teach and apologized. She responded with a cold text saying she’ll take care of it and not to worry, and yet I apologized for not being able to teach. I even offered to help her trace the drawings after my shift (7pm) but she refused. The Paint Night comes along and I see IG stories from her coffee shop page showing paintings from that night with designs that aren’t mine. I took that as a sign of disrespect and yet after my shift I showed up to the paint night to say hello, which was received with disdain and a clear tone that I wasn’t welcome by her.

Fifteen years of several house moves, two changes in career, a child, a mental breakdown. Not mine but sometimes I feel like I'm clinging to sanity by the thinnest of threads. 
Sometimes I think that no one would miss me if I was gone. Hell I'm not sure anyone outside of these walls would notice. Somewhere, I lost myself. I lost myself in being a mum, I lost myself in keeping you together. I lost myself in the dozens of times you made me feel like I couldn't be me. I wasn't free. I was chained to this house and this marriage like I was the only thing keeping you afloat. Now, I don't even know how to be the person I was. I lost my friends, I lost my esteem. No one likes me. I look for validation on the internet. I reach out to people we barely know. They don't reply. 
Maybe I'm just a pathetic piece of shit who people endure.
No one wants my friendship. No one even wants my services anymore. Work has dried up. Maybe everyone is just better than me.
Your love is toxic. You tell me you have never wanted me to stay home, you have never wanted me to abandon myself. Yet I did. I did it because you told me you couldn't sleep when I wasn't home, that you couldn't shake the belief that I was going to leave you. Now my life has all but vanished. And I pretend that swinging fills that void. Fulfills the void in my life with people who care. They don't care. Why would they? They just want to get their dick wet. It's literally the point. But you? You made friends with all the poly girls and thought about sleeping with them. You go for coffee with them whilst you tell me you feel uncomfortable with the idea of me going on solo dates. 
Is this where you want me? At a place where I feel shitty enough about myself not to pursue anyone, so that you can play the role of supportive husband? All the whilst safe in the knowledge that I haven't got anyone else I'm interested in, so you don't have to feel discomfort and threat? 
Are you a gaslighter? Am I so blinded by your manipulation? 
Sometimes I wonder if I've spent years convincing myself that I love you. I ignored those red flags. That possessive nature. That love bombing. 
And here we are, fifteen years down the line. I thought about leaving you before. I have no idea what that would look like. I don't have money, or savings, or anyone I can turn to. And so life ebbs on. I don't know who I am. I don't know what I want. I feel intense guilt for failing my child. I think about getting in my car and driving until the fuel runs out. I thought about packing our bags and leaving without you. Just us. Me and my boy, going home with my tail between my legs. Ending up where I started. 
I always believed I was strong. Had my shit together. Didn't let anyone tell me what to do. Wrong. I'm weak. I let you control me. I'm so tired. I don't have the energy to make it stop. So I sit here and I slowly fragment into pieces. Pieces behind the smile. Like a shattered mirror. I look at the pieces of myself and I see them. I accept them. I watch the world drift on by in the broken corners, unable to muster up the energy to reach them. 
My life is an insignificant blip in the grand scheme of things. A dot. A single speck of cosmic dust people will cry over for a day and say how amazing I was. How I loved life. 
Did I? Did I love my life? Did I leave any sort of legacy? Would my son know there was sadness behind my eyes that would go on to haunt him? 
Would I lay on my deathbed and regret all those times I cried on the sofa. Would I berate myself for wasting my days wishing shit was different and doing nothing about it? Would I regret the hours I questioned whether I should stay? Whether I could live with leaving knowing you might die because of it? 
My shell remains. It performs. It does it's duty. I let those bit inside me that want more die so the shell keeps going. It dries it's tears, slaps a smile on and folds the laundry. 
My life is fine. It's ok. It could be so much worse right?

1heqlyn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1heqlyn,"Vietnam trip - Mar 2024 (Hoi An, Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi)","Places covered:

Photos 1-8: Hoi An - start of the trip, remember being very upbeat here. Visited the usual attractions - Golden Hands bridge, Ba Na hills, went coconut boating. Also had some lovely Pho and salted coffee. Ba Na hills is touristy AF and probably somewhat commercialised, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Also visited the night markets to go souvenir shopping. Lovely ambience considering this is a very touristy place - lots of people and booze and shops, friendly locals, and good vibes.

Photos 9-13: Ho Chi Minh City/Saigon - historical and industrial hub. Loved the book street here (avid reader myself), the old post office, the Cu Chi tunnels that show you remnants of the war with America. Can buy high-end Nguyen coffee here, and it also has the local Saigon beer and Banh Mi. While many people dub this place boring, because it’s probably not very pretty in a touristy way (and it was also pretty hot in March), I think this should be on the list of anyone visiting the country. You figure the real historical pulse of this country’s rife communist past here, and the extent of violence they saw - the Cu Chi tunnels are intricate, we spent the better part of a day exploring them, you can see the tankers and the tunnels they used, and there are statues enacting scenes from the war times too. Probably not super pleasant, but important to visit if you want the real context of Vietnam and want to know what it is about. Also, you can send postcards all over the world still from the HCM post office :)

Photos 9-end: Hanoi - probably one of my more favourite places in the entire trip. I planned out my days in Hanoi in a super laid-back fashion. Spent most of my time strolling the streets, interacting with locals and eating local food, unfortunately skipping touristier attractions like Ha Long bay. This was a tradeoff I was fine with. It had lovely misty weather and some cold when we visited, and the locals were very welcoming. We stayed and I mostly explored the Old Quarter area, around the St Joseph’s Cathedral. Very cosmopolitan vibe too, I ended up meeting many tourists from many countries. I loved the Asian-country vibe in this place, it has been a long-time favourite.

Overall, loved the trip. Have some cool shots in video format, like the cable car ride in Ba Na Hills, please let me know if I should share those too.",2,1734261613.0,travel,2,0.67,False

They usually act as a way to protect shower screens from becoming absolutely filthy.  They do some other things as well that honestly I don’t even remember anymore.  

For the last year or so I’ve been using one, yes a single one, with a flair 58.  There’s not a shower screen so, you already know there’s another reason.  Probably something about water distribution.  

At the beginning I was diligent.  Hot water after every use.  But slowly that faded.  I figured, if I’m brewing the same coffee, once every few days shouldn’t be bad.  

The rest of the flair I am very diligent with.  Every week the thing may as well be brand new.  But that puck screen, well, that’s a different story.  

Recently I picked up a new roast and it just wasn’t quite right.  It tasted a little off, I figured it was too fine a grind as it was choking.  Went for a coarser grind, same issue.  Maybe my burrs need a clean?  Nope.  I couldn’t figure it out.  A month later I went back to my old beans and that weird underlying taste was still there.  

It was like this slight dirt taste.  I haven’t associated the taste of dirt with coffee in years.  Maybe there was something wrong with my water.  I took the water I was using and boiled it, well not boiled but you know, and let it cool drank it - nothing.  

I cleaned everything again, nothing.  

Then I remember watching some video suggesting to rotate your puck screens and I figured, maybe?  Maybe it’s that.  

So I smelled it.  

When I was younger I would sometimes leave random cups of coffee out and usually they had some milk in it.  I’d find this air tight container with some chunky residue and that spoiled mildew shit hit my nose like immediately.  

And yeah, that’s what it smelled like.  

Remember what I said before?  Coarser grind and it was choking.  Yeah, idk what’s living inside my puck screen but it’s so thick that it’s literally causing the brew to choke.  

Should have known something was off when the other day I removed the thing on accident and it was like a water fall.  

I’m looking forward to my coffee tomorrow morning. Bought three new screens.  ",2,1734261305.0,espresso,6,0.67,False

The only things I know about the person whose name I got is that he is in his mid to late 20s, he's engaged, he doesn't like coffee, and he's talked about how he's gone over to his parents' farm the last couple of weekends to help his dad chop wood, which he really enjoys due to the fresh air and exercise.

I was thinking about giving him a pair of rechargeable hand warmers that each have an LED flashlight and can be used as a power bank to charge your phone.

Let's face it, nobody wants to be known for having dragon breath. In a world obsessed with fresh breath and pearly whites, the question of whether vaping contributes to bad breath is a hot topic. We all know smoking's reputation for causing a stale mouth, but what about its supposedly healthier cousin, vaping? Does it carry the same baggage? This article dives deep into the connection between vaping and bad breath, exploring the science, the anecdotal evidence, and offering practical solutions for keeping your breath minty fresh, even if you vape. We'll unpack the complexities, debunk myths, and arm you with the knowledge to make informed decisions about your oral health.

Does Vaping Give You Bad Breath? The Science Behind the Smell
-------------------------------------------------------------

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty, it's crucial to understand the science behind bad breath in general. Most cases – we're talking upwards of 85% – originate in the mouth. It's a bacterial breeding ground, a veritable petri dish of microscopic critters feasting on food particles and producing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) as a byproduct. These VSCs, my friends, are the culprits behind that dreaded morning breath and the unfortunate post-garlic-bread aroma.

Now, where does vaping fit into this equation? Well, it turns out that many of the ingredients in e-liquid, like propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin, can actually decrease saliva production. Saliva, believe it or not, is your mouth's natural defense against bad breath. It acts like a rinse cycle, washing away food particles and neutralizing those pesky VSCs. So, when vaping dries out your mouth, it creates a perfect storm for bacteria to thrive and VSCs to accumulate, leading to – you guessed it – bad breath.

### The Dehydrating Effects of Vaping

Think of your mouth like a lush garden. Saliva is the rain that keeps it healthy and thriving. Vaping, on the other hand, acts like a drought, sucking the moisture away and leaving the garden parched and vulnerable. This dryness, also known as xerostomia, is a major player in bad breath development.

### How Vaping Ingredients Contribute to the Problem

Beyond simply drying out your mouth, certain e-liquid ingredients can directly contribute to the problem. Some flavorings, especially sweeter ones, can become breeding grounds for bacteria. Imagine leaving a sugary drink sitting out – it quickly becomes sticky and attracts all sorts of unwanted guests. The same principle applies to the sugary residue left behind by some vapes.

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Does Vaping Give You Bad Breath? Considering Other Factors
----------------------------------------------------------

While vaping itself can contribute to bad breath, it's not the sole culprit in every case. Just like a detective investigating a crime scene, we need to consider all the potential suspects.

### Existing Oral Hygiene Habits

Let's be real, folks. Even if you weren't vaping, neglecting your oral hygiene would eventually lead to bad breath. Think of it this way: brushing and flossing are like the police force in your mouth, keeping the bacterial population under control. If you're not regularly brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash, you're giving those smelly VSCs free rein to wreak havoc.

### Diet and Lifestyle Choices

What you eat and drink plays a significant role in your breath's freshness. Garlic, onions, coffee – these are notorious offenders. Similarly, smoking cigarettes, chewing tobacco, or consuming excessive alcohol can all contribute to bad breath, regardless of whether you vape or not. It's all about the bigger picture, folks.

### Underlying Medical Conditions

In some cases, persistent bad breath can be a sign of an underlying medical condition like gum disease, diabetes, or even acid reflux. If you're concerned about your breath, it's always a good idea to chat with your doctor or dentist to rule out any potential health issues.

Does Vaping Give You Bad Breath? Separating Fact from Fiction
-------------------------------------------------------------

The internet is awash with information – and misinformation – about vaping. Let's debunk some common myths and set the record straight.

- **Myth:** Vaping is completely harmless to oral health.
- **Fact:** While generally considered less harmful than smoking, vaping can still negatively impact oral health, including contributing to dry mouth and bad breath.
- **Myth:** All e-liquids are created equal.
- **Fact:** The composition of e-liquids varies widely, and some ingredients, particularly sugary flavorings, can exacerbate bad breath.
- **Myth:** Switching to vaping automatically eliminates smoker's breath.
- **Fact:** While vaping can improve breath compared to smoking, it doesn't guarantee fresh breath, especially if other contributing factors, like poor oral hygiene, are at play.

Tips for Fresher Breath While Vaping
------------------------------------

So, what can you do to combat vape-related bad breath? Fear not, breath enthusiasts! Here are some practical tips to keep your mouth feeling and smelling its best:

1. **Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate:** Drinking plenty of water throughout the day is crucial for combating dry mouth. Think of it like watering that garden we talked about earlier.
2. **Choose Your E-Liquids Wisely:** Opt for sugar-free e-liquids and avoid overly sweet flavors. Remember, less sugar means less food for those stink-producing bacteria.
3. **Step Up Your Oral Hygiene Game:** Brush twice a day, floss daily, and use a tongue scraper to remove bacteria from the back of your tongue. It's like giving your mouth a deep clean.
4. **Chew Sugar-Free Gum or Mints:** These can stimulate saliva production and provide a temporary burst of freshness. It's a quick fix, but every little bit helps!
5. **Visit Your Dentist Regularly:** Regular checkups and cleanings are essential for maintaining good oral health and catching potential problems early on. Think of it as preventative maintenance for your mouth.
6. **Consider Vaping Alternatives:** If you're truly concerned about bad breath, you might consider exploring alternative nicotine delivery methods, such as nicotine patches or gum.

Conclusion: Taking Control of Your Breath
-----------------------------------------

So, does vaping give you bad breath? The answer, as with most things in life, isn't a simple yes or no. While vaping itself can contribute to dry mouth and exacerbate existing oral hygiene issues, it’s not the sole villain in every bad breath story. By understanding the science, addressing contributing factors, and adopting healthy habits, you can take control of your breath and keep it minty fresh, even if you vape. Remember, fresh breath is within your reach – it just takes a little effort and a good understanding of the factors at play. Don't let vaping get in the way of a confident smile and fresh breath!

1heq9ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1heq9ct/constipation_solution_my_friends_ive_found/,"Constipation solution: MY FRIENDS, I’ve found something that has helped my constipation drastically—it’s chia and flax seeds. ","TLDR: Someone suggested using ground chia and flax seeds soaked in water/milk/yogurt to reduce my constipation and it has helped DRASTICALLY.  I’llI even eat cheese sometimes now. Not sure if it will work for you, but I hope it helps!

- 1 Tbsp ground flax seeds
- 1 Tbsp ground chia seeds **
- 4-6 oz of water/milk of choice OR yogurt/coconut yogurt 
- a little coffee creamer for taste if you need it

- Magnesium glycinate each night ****


Directions: Soak the seeds overnight and consume the next day. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. 

** (I grind the chia seeds myself with a coffee grinder—I have Crohn’s and seeds aren’t advised)

**** (I take 1000 mgs of magnesium, but I’m not sure what would work for you. Always good to check with your doctor first!! I can’t tolerate magnesium citrate, but that’s an option too.)

PSA: DO NOT pour the mix down the drain/dishwasher. Put it in the TRASH. I don’t even rinse the container in my sink. I wipe out any remaining seeds, THEN wash as normal. Idk if it’s bad for pipes, but it stopped up my sink strainer pretty well. Better safe. 
———————————————-

I was diagnosed with Crohn’s in March of this year. Had been experiencing constipation and using magnesium alone, but it stopped helping. 

I personally didn’t want to take miralax because the scope prep I used called for drinking a small bottle of miralax in Gatorade and that caused my first Crohn’s flare up which has been a real bad time on top of the constipation. 

I know it helps a lot of people, so I’m not knocking it, but I just wanted to avoid risking another flare up. 

Constipation was making me stressed and miserable. I’m still careful to avoid cheese most days and dried meats like jerky, but I can occasionally have a little. 

**** I drink the ground chia & flax mix every day with plenty of water to be sure it has water to pull into my colon. IF YOU DON’T DRINK ENOUGH WATER, IT MAY NOT BE AS HELPFUL AND COULD ADD TO CONSTIPATION ISSUES. I also stir the mix well to avoid drinking clumps of seeds, which could also be bad. ****

The first sip is a little off-putting, but the benefits far out way any cons. I also bulk mix it in a larger container and prep two of those at a time. I marked off lines on the containers  so that they each hold three servings and just drink straight from those because it’s fast and easy. Once it’s gone, I pour a sip of water in it and swirl it around to get most of the remaining seeds, then drink that before washing it. 

I avoid putting the mix down the drain to keep from messing up my sewer system. Don’t need two sets of clogged pipes 🙃. Idk for a fact that it would clog pipes, but it stopped up my sink strainer, so better safe. Had those re-dug once and it’s not easy or cheap!

I’ve been doing this routine for several months now and so far, so good. 
If you have questions, please let me know!!

Hi,
I recently bought a bottomless portafilter and a good grinder for my machine (delonghi dedica). 
After a lot of tries and sour coffees i finally got a good coffee or at least the taste i wanted. 
My problem is that i had to push on the button several times before the coffee was able to flow correctly in the cup (there were only a few drops at the beginning)

So my question is what should i change to keep the same taste but let the coffee flow easier ? 
Should i put more/less coffee ? Or maybe change the grind setting ? Or is it the tamping ?

I was at this nice coffee shop minding my own business and waiting in line to order. There were two cashiers at the registers, and each were taking the orders before me.

In front of me was this older lady with a nice jacket on and a typical Karen hairdo. Based off of nothing but her outfit, I could imagine her order being this complicated coffee (if it even is coffee at that point) with a shot of espresso, non-dairy milk, and a fuck tonne of sugar. She went to order, and she ordered a latte macchiato with two pumps of vanilla and oat milk.

You see, this is important because I drink black coffee. The purest, blackest coffee as bitter as my imagination towards people I find annoying. Anything else in it ruins the experience, regardless of the fact that people like something other than the hot darkness along with a chat with friends. But I love being contrarian, even if millions of other people enjoy black like I do. Most coffee shops don't understand the greatness of my order when I come in and order it, and I end up having to wildly explain the concept of a plain, black, sugar and milkless coffee.

Back to the story. After this old bitch finished her order and paid for it, it was my go. The barista smiled and asked for my order, and I quickly responded with, ""Black.""

""Sorry?"" he asked me with a funny look.""

""A large black coffee,"" I repeated. He still looked confused. How did this coffeeshop worker not know what a \*black coffee\* was?

It took him a moment to say something, and he replied, ""The closest thing we have is plain americano on our menu... Would you like that?""

I resisted the urge to roll my eyes at him, and explained to him what a plain black coffee was. You boil the water and stir in the coffee and serve it! He kept insisting that they had it, but he kept calling it this americano shit... Eventually he yielded and said, ""Yes, we have black coffee, but we call it americano because of how we prepare it-""

""Black coffee! A large black coffee please!"" 

He relented, mumbled something under his breath and I got my coffee. I paid for it and walked away, watching that old Karen wait for her order to be made. Someone behind the counter must've decided they had enough of her presence (even if she was here for ten minutes at most) and put dairy into her dairy-free coffee. I guess Karen noticed that and complained in this shrill voice (a little above a whisper) ""Excuse me... I asked for oat milk for my order?""

The person making the coffee made no attempt to show their true emotions, but I imagine that redoing such an order had to be a pain in the ass. But they did so anyways, to placate the Karen's emotions. A meltdown might have been imminent if they had to redo that chore.

I rolled my eyes. I can't believe someone would put an innocent barista through something like this. I drank my black coffee in peace and made a comment about it to two police officers eating donuts. They looked at me funny. One even said ""What the hell are you talking about?""

The police weren't on my side either!

I've been a server at all levels of spots (casual to big city fancy) for some 20 years off / on.  I work at a local CB and here's my observations.

The FOH / BOH is largely great. You have normal things like some servers are better at helping out (making tea / coffee , running other folks food, pre bussing) but all and all it seems like everyone tries pretty hard and wants to do a good job.  The managers are helpful and work hard as well.

However, it seems like the restaurant is stretched too thin.  Like at my store often the servers have to make their own salads / baked potatoes / desserts. And then this is added unto fact (at least at my store) that servers run the food and bus tables.  (To be fair it seems they have one busser who works during busy times but he can only do so much)

It seems like customers -- when it's busy -- almost expect too much.  1st let me say the prices seem to be shockingly low.  like very good value.  But diners at CB in my albeit limited experience WANT SO MUCH.  tons of refills of coffee, drinks, More and More biscuits / corn bread / butter / jelly.

I guess in a nutshell it just seems that at least my store there simply isn't enough staff on the busy shifts to make for a smooth operation.  I guess that's my bottom line.",2,1734259597.0,CrackerBarrel,2,1.0,False

1heq028,https://www.reddit.com/r/helpme/comments/1heq028/i_am_very_lost/,I am very lost.,"Hi there, this is my first Reddit post so bare with me, I'm 23M and I have been having one of the most roughest times of my life probably ever.

I was in a 3 year relationship with a girl I met from college, I thought I was happy for the beginning of the relationship but there was a lot of turmoil with us even at the start dealing with a person who was jealous of us getting together. 

Since may of this year with all of the fighting I have found myself really unhappy in the relationship, I wanted out but couldn't pull the trigger due to us being in the same friend group, I was terrified of what would happen next so I told myself I was being silly for months and that I was happy, before that though, I was so happy with this girl, she meant everything to me and still does, we both studied animation together and I thought I had met the ""one"". 

A month ago however, I realised that the longer I hold off on breaking up the worse things will get for me, so I decided to pull the trigger randomly on a date night, it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, I've never broken up with someone before I was always the dumpee, we agreed we'd still be friends and we didn't have a bad breakup. 

Since then as you'd expect I've been miserable without her, my confidence has completely dropped in myself, I don't really care about myself anymore at all, my therapist I had been seeing for 4 years has completely ghosted me since September so I've had no healthy way of talking about it to anyone really. I have a lot of friends but they come and go alot which makes me feel even lonelier as I never have any meaningful connection to any of them and I feel like they're one and done hang outs. I have been going the gym but I'm so weak and can barely lift heavy things at all so it feels all for naught and I don't get any succession from it at all. 


My dog a week ago had to get his eye taken out and that's been rough on me and also the family, we're getting used to it but it still really gets me down that all of this is happening at once. My grandmother is very sick and it feels like 2021 all over again when my ex split up with me and 3 weeks later my nanny who I miss so so much to this day had passed, since I lost her I feel like nobody in the world understands me as a person only she did.


I keep being a burden to my older sister constantly asking for help and advice to the point where it's interrupting her day to day life and it's obviously taking a toll on her and that's not fair. But I have no idea what to do at all. 

Recently I tried to go on a date way too soon after the breakup, but I was feeling really down and with the news of my grandmother and my dog I just didn't care anymore about anything or anyone's feelings, I went on two dates and we kissed but that's about it, but the second date I knew that what I was doing was unhealthy and decided to cut it off, I explained to the girl that I didn't want her to think she was a rebound and she explained to me that she was actually doing the same thing as me, just out of a relationship too.


Recently I watched all of arcane S2 and it was amazing absolutely loved every second of it, my friends and all decided to install league of legends, and it was fun at the beginning when we played against bots and stuff but once we went against real players, yeah the hype died for me very quick.

I don't find the game all that fun and all my friends would make fun of me every night on call when I would die over and over again to the point where you could tell they were getting fed up playing with me. I would end up leaving and feeling like crap going to bed realising I could've played a single player game because now I feel worse about myself. They would still ask me to play every night and say they don't care about my performance but? They do? So I ended up clapping back and insulting them back, but when I do it I'm being told that I'm passive aggressive and that I need to chill out? It's all really confusing for me because I'm not sure how to rip into people back without them getting offended. 

I don't have many friends left in that friend group, i mentioned I had a lot of friends but they're all from different areas of my life like jobs/school/etc. 

The job I work in is fine but it's also starting to really put me down, I work in a warehouse in a tech store and such. A lot of people in there are a bit lazy and don't do much and I feel like I'm always the only one who really locks in and does it ?  I am miserable there.

My whole life I've been a punching bag and made fun of, always been a doormat, I never stand up for myself as I like to have social etiquette with people. I genuinely don't know what to do because when I hit back at people they get really upset and say that I went too far. Which I don't understand cause they do too sometimes and I just take it as is.

I keep waking up everyday absolutely miserable I'm trying to get back into my art but everytime I log into insta I see my ex has liked everything to do with arcane and art and everything and it just makes me sad and miserable and I don't want to anything. I also lost a lot of confidence in my art and feel like I was never good to begin with.


Only recently I started to like things that I ACTUALLY like, I was bullied a lot for liking things like Kingdom hearts and Sonic the hedgehog and to a degree I still do get made fun of for liking those things. It really gets in on me sometimes and makes me feel like a pathetic person. It was so bad that for years I would make new accounts on game consoles so it wouldn't display I was playing these games and it was really unhealthy.


Back in June I was running, which is what I do for exercise, and I had asked a friend to go out for a coffee as he was in the area I was running out to. We met up had our coffee, all of a sudden I get 7 miscalls popping up on my phone from one of my other friends, I answer and he starts complaining the fact that he feels left out for not getting an invite even though I had asked this ONE person out of group to hang out and that's all. It didn't help that my friend had asked one of the others to hang out so the odds were stacked against me on that front. I explained to him that I didn't invite the other guy and it was supposed to be a one on one thing and that was all, but he couldn't see that and started being a baby about it for awhile and making me feel extremely guilty and even talking about to my exs back about it and everything. I had enough of it all and absolutely snapped at the guy which I shouldn't have. I realised that was horrible of me and he told me to F off and since that event we haven't been the same. 

Another one of the guys is very grouchy and no matter what I do I could never make this man happy, he would always talk about me and say that me doing running is a bad thing, that im emotionally stupid, would make fun of me for making new accounts and stuff which he wasn't wrong for, and just in general would always put me down. He took my friends side and said that I was being an muppet and to my face said that ""like I'm always gonna take this side no matter what"" and that was soul crushing to hear, like why do you just dislike me so much, he makes fun of me for the fact that I have a job and work and pays attention to the things I buy and makes fun of me for that too which is literally just video games and clothing ? He constantly tells me at random points to ""get over myself"" and he says this A lot. I don't understand why he keeps saying this to me at all.


Hes a well respected person in the college group I think at least as I have heard people say to me they don't like him but he's way smarter and better than me in every way and always knows what to say. I just feel like the odds are completely against me and maybe I should leave.

My ex has been really lovely though she's been keeping tabs on me and me with her and making sure we're both okay and we've even cracked some jokes about the whole breakup too. I'm meeting up with this entire group next week for Christmas drinks and I'm really not looking forward to it, I still haven't seen my ex since the break up.


The one person that's been such a life saver and I'll just call him Jack, he's been super supportive and he's got a really good career he's in good shape and keeps encouraging me to stick around and that nothing bad will happen, he has been there for me for every second of all this and keeps making fun of the people i mentioned that put me down and think that a lot of people don't like these individuals but just pretend to as they don't want to be excluded from future events. He has been such a confidence booster and so has my friend Danny who also lifts me up. (Only issue being that he's the one I can tell I annoy when I play league of legends with him) but other than that these people have been absolute god sends to me and I'm terrified of losing them. They literally describe me as a god to people and I've never had that experience before and that's when I knew to leave the guy who was grouchy with me all the time for this guy.  I also think just because of the person I am I'll never meet another girl again because I don't have the confidence for it at all I don't think I ever will be, at every point in my life I felt I was over being timid and that ""hey I'm confident!"" I'd fall back down again. I don't think there's much hope for me. I studied animation for 4 years and got my degree and where did it get me ? Absolutely nowhere that's for sure.


I'm a bit lost at the moment and i could really use some help. I'm sorry for the whole life story but it makes sense I think.
 

I would be eternally grateful to anyone that could reach out and we could start a conversation about this


Thanks!!!

In today's digital age, online privacy and security have become paramount concerns for users across the globe. With hackers, trackers, and malicious actors lurking on the internet, it’s essential to protect your personal data. One of the most effective tools to ensure privacy and security is a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic, hiding your online activities from prying eyes and keeping your personal information safe.

For iOS users, the need for a VPN has become even more urgent. While Apple’s ecosystem is known for its robust security features, the increasing amount of data that flows through our smartphones makes it a prime target for cybercriminals. A VPN for iOS ensures that your online activities are shielded from anyone looking to track or intercept them. This article explores the benefits of using a VPN on your iOS device, especially focusing on free VPN options, and offers tips on choosing the best one for your needs.

**What Makes a VPN Ideal for iOS?**

When selecting a VPN for your iOS device, compatibility is key. Not all VPNs are designed to work seamlessly with iPhones and iPads, so it’s important to choose one that offers dedicated support for iOS. An ideal VPN should be compatible with the latest iOS updates, ensuring that it functions smoothly and doesn’t cause system slowdowns.

Another important factor is ease of use. The iOS platform is known for its intuitive design, and the VPN app should align with this philosophy. A user-friendly interface, easy setup process, and simple navigation are essential for a hassle-free experience. Additionally, a VPN for iOS should not just offer basic encryption but should also include features like kill switches, DNS leak protection, and split tunneling.

Lastly, performance matters. For iOS users, the VPN should ensure fast, reliable connections without compromising on security. Whether you’re browsing the web, streaming content, or using public Wi-Fi, the VPN should provide uninterrupted, secure access to the internet.

**The Benefits of Using a VPN on Your iOS Device**

Using a VPN on your iOS device brings a multitude of benefits. One of the most significant advantages is enhanced security and privacy. When connected to a VPN, all your internet traffic is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers or other malicious actors to intercept your data. This is particularly important when you are using public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in airports, coffee shops, or hotels, which are prime targets for cybercriminals looking to steal personal information.

A VPN also helps you bypass geographical restrictions and access content that may be blocked in your region. For example, if you’re traveling abroad and want to watch your favorite shows on streaming platforms like Netflix, a VPN can help you connect to a server in your home country, granting you access to region-specific content.

Furthermore, using a VPN ensures that your browsing activities are anonymous. By masking your IP address, a VPN makes it difficult for websites, advertisers, and even your internet service provider to track your online behavior. This adds a layer of privacy and reduces the amount of data collected about you, which is especially important for those concerned with digital privacy.

**How Free VPNs Work on iOS Devices**

A free VPN for iOS can provide you with many of the same security benefits as paid options, but it’s important to understand how these services work and their limitations. Free VPNs generally offer a basic level of security, such as encrypting your data and masking your IP address. However, these services often come with restrictions that paid VPNs do not have.

One of the biggest limitations of free VPNs is their data caps. Many free VPN providers offer a limited amount of data per month, which may not be enough for heavy users. Streaming, large file downloads, and even regular browsing can quickly eat up your data allowance, forcing you to wait until the next month or upgrade to a paid plan.

Free VPNs also tend to have fewer server locations, meaning you may not have as many options for bypassing geographic restrictions. They can also suffer from slower speeds due to overcrowded servers, as free services are often used by a large number of users at the same time.

Lastly, while many free VPNs offer basic encryption, they may not include advanced security features such as a kill switch or DNS leak protection. This could leave your data exposed in certain circumstances. Despite these limitations, free VPNs can still provide a decent level of security for users who only need a VPN for light browsing or occasional use.

**Free VPN for iOS: How to Choose the Best One**

When selecting a free VPN for iOS, it’s crucial to choose one that aligns with your specific needs. Here are some key factors to consider:

1. **Speed and Reliability:** The VPN should offer fast connection speeds, even on free plans. Slow speeds can make browsing, streaming, and downloading frustrating, so it’s important to check user reviews for performance feedback before downloading a VPN app.
2. **Data Limits:** Many free VPNs impose data caps, which can be a dealbreaker if you plan on using the VPN frequently. Look for a free VPN that offers a generous data allowance or even unlimited data.
3. **Server Locations:** A good free VPN should have a variety of server locations to help you bypass geo-blocked content. The more server locations available, the more options you have for accessing content from different regions.
4. **Security Features:** Even free VPNs should offer essential security features like AES-256 encryption, a no-logs policy, and DNS leak protection. These features help ensure your data remains private and secure while using the VPN.
5. **User Interface:** The app should be easy to use and navigate. Look for a free VPN that offers a simple setup process and intuitive design, so you can connect quickly without hassle.

By evaluating these factors, you can choose a free VPN for iOS that meets your needs without compromising on security or usability.

**Setting Up a Free VPN for iOS**

Setting up a VPN on your iOS device is generally straightforward, thanks to the simple and intuitive interface that most VPN apps offer. Whether you’re a seasoned tech user or a beginner, the process should be hassle-free if you follow the correct steps. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get started with a free VPN for iOS:

1. **Download the VPN App** First, you need to download the VPN app from the Apple App Store. Once you've identified the free VPN service that meets your needs (based on speed, security, and features), go ahead and install it on your device. The installation process is similar to any other app you might download, so it shouldn't take long.
2. **Create an Account** Most free VPN services will require you to sign up with an email address. This step allows the VPN provider to track your usage and manage your account. For some services, the sign-up process may involve confirming your email address or agreeing to their terms of service.
3. **Configure the VPN Settings** After the app is installed, open it, and you’ll typically be prompted to connect to the VPN. Some VPN apps might require you to enable specific settings or provide your device's credentials to ensure proper configuration. The app might ask you to allow it to create a VPN profile on your iOS device. This is essential for the VPN to route your internet traffic securely. Tap ""Allow"" when prompted.
4. **Select a Server Location** Once the VPN is active, the next step is to select a server location. Some free VPN services offer limited server locations, while others might provide a wider range of options. Choose a server based on what you need: for example, if you're trying to access content from a specific region, select a server located there.
5. **Connect to the VPN** After configuring the settings and selecting a server, simply tap the connect button. Once the VPN is connected, you should see a VPN icon appear on your iPhone's status bar, indicating that your internet traffic is encrypted and routed through the VPN server.
6. **Troubleshoot and Optimize** If you encounter issues with the VPN connection (such as slow speeds or failed connections), you can troubleshoot by restarting the app or switching servers. If the problem persists, consult the app's support page for assistance.

**Maximizing Your iOS VPN: Best Practices**

To get the most out of your free VPN for iOS, there are several best practices you should follow. These tips will help you maintain strong security, optimize performance, and ensure a seamless experience while using your VPN.

1. **Keep Your VPN App Updated** As with any app, it's important to keep your VPN app up to date. Developers frequently release updates to fix bugs, enhance security, and improve performance. Make sure you’re running the latest version to ensure you have the best experience and protection.
2. **Enable Auto-Connect Features** Many VPN apps for iOS offer an auto-connect feature that automatically connects your device to the VPN whenever you join an unsecured network, such as public Wi-Fi. Enabling this feature ensures that you're always protected, even if you forget to manually activate the VPN.
3. **Choose a Server Near Your Location** While using a VPN to connect to servers in other countries is great for accessing geo-blocked content, connecting to a server far away can slow down your connection speed. To maintain fast browsing and streaming, try to connect to a server that is geographically closer to you.
4. **Use Split Tunneling** If your VPN offers split tunneling, make use of this feature to control which apps or services route through the VPN and which don’t. This allows you to balance the security benefits of the VPN with your need for speed in non-sensitive applications.
5. **Avoid Using Free VPNs for High-Bandwidth Activities** Free VPNs often have bandwidth limitations, and they might not be suitable for activities like heavy streaming or large downloads. Use your free VPN primarily for general browsing, public Wi-Fi protection, and accessing basic content.
6. **Regularly Review Privacy Settings** Even though you’re using a VPN to protect your privacy, it’s still important to periodically review your VPN's privacy settings. Some free VPNs collect minimal data, but it's always wise to ensure that your chosen provider follows a strict no-logs policy to avoid any data being stored or shared.

By following these best practices, you can make the most of your free VPN for iOS while ensuring a fast, secure, and efficient browsing experience.

**Are Free VPNs Secure Enough for iOS?**

While many users are drawn to free VPNs for iOS due to their cost-effectiveness, one common concern is their security. Are free VPNs secure enough to protect your data? The short answer is: it depends on the provider. Some free VPNs offer solid security features, while others might not be as reliable.

Here’s what to look out for when considering the security of a free VPN:

1. **Encryption Protocols** A trustworthy free VPN should use strong encryption protocols to protect your data. Look for VPNs that offer AES-256 bit encryption, which is the gold standard for online security. This encryption ensures that your internet traffic is scrambled in a way that makes it nearly impossible for hackers to decipher.
2. **No-Logs Policy** The best VPNs—whether free or paid—adhere to a strict no-logs policy, meaning they don’t collect or store your browsing data. It’s essential to verify that the free VPN you’re using does not log any of your activities, as this could compromise your privacy.
3. **DNS and IP Leak Protection** One vulnerability in some VPN services is the possibility of DNS or IP address leaks, which could expose your real identity even while connected to the VPN. Look for a free VPN that includes DNS and IP leak protection, ensuring that no data is inadvertently exposed.
4. **Ad and Malware Protection** While some free VPNs provide additional security features such as ad-blocking and malware protection, others may expose you to the risk of intrusive ads or malicious software. If you're using a free VPN, always check if these features are included to further bolster your security.
5. **Avoid Untrustworthy Providers** Some free VPN providers may compromise your privacy in exchange for monetizing your data. They may sell your browsing information to third-party advertisers or inject ads into your browsing experience. To avoid these risks, research the reputation of the free VPN provider before installing it on your iOS device.

Although free VPNs are often less feature-rich than paid options, with the right choice, they can offer a reasonable level of security for your iOS device. Just remember to assess the provider’s commitment to privacy and security before trusting it with your personal data.

**Alternatives to Free VPN for iOS**

While free VPNs can be useful, they are not without limitations, such as data restrictions, slower speeds, and fewer features. If you need more robust security, greater speed, or additional functionality, you may want to consider upgrading to a paid VPN. Let’s take a look at the differences and when a premium VPN might be the right choice:

1. **Premium VPN Features** Premium VPNs often offer more advanced security features, such as multi-hop connections (routing your traffic through multiple servers), split tunneling, and access to more secure encryption protocols. These features can help enhance your online privacy and security.
2. **Faster Speeds and Unlimited Data** Unlike free VPNs that impose data caps, premium VPNs typically offer unlimited data, allowing you to browse, stream, and download without worry. They also tend to provide faster speeds, ensuring a smoother experience for all your online activities.
3. **More Server Locations** Paid VPNs offer a broader selection of server locations, allowing you to access geo-restricted content from almost anywhere in the world. This can be a major advantage if you need to access content from different countries or regions regularly.
4. **Customer Support** With a paid VPN, you often get access to dedicated customer support, which can help resolve any issues you encounter. Whether it's troubleshooting connection problems or getting advice on which server to choose, having customer support can be a huge advantage.
5. **Privacy and No Logs** Premium VPNs are more likely to adhere to a strict no-logs policy and provide transparency about their privacy practices. While free VPNs may sometimes compromise on privacy, paying for a VPN service can ensure that your data is protected and not sold to third parties.

Although free VPNs can suffice for basic browsing, premium VPNs offer a more secure, faster, and feature-rich experience. If privacy and security are your top priorities, and you use a VPN frequently, upgrading to a paid plan might be worth considering.

**How Free VPNs for iOS Compare to Other Platforms**

While VPNs are widely used on desktop and laptop devices, mobile users—particularly iOS users—are also turning to VPNs to protect their privacy and ensure secure browsing. However, when it comes to iOS devices, the experience of using a free VPN can differ from the experience on other platforms like Android, macOS, or Windows. So how do free VPNs for iOS compare to those on other platforms? Let's explore the differences:

# 1. Platform-Specific Advantages

* **iOS Security:** iOS is known for its strong security features, and this is one of the primary reasons many users choose Apple devices in the first place. iPhones and iPads are designed to have a highly controlled app ecosystem, meaning apps (including VPNs) are heavily vetted before being allowed into the App Store. This adds an extra layer of security compared to platforms like Android, which are more prone to third-party app vulnerabilities.
* **App Integration:** On iOS, VPN apps are tightly integrated with the system, which can make the setup process easier and faster. The iOS operating system offers built-in options for connecting to VPNs through its native settings, making it less reliant on third-party VPN apps in some cases. This streamlined integration can result in better performance and fewer issues when connecting to a VPN.
* **Control and Customization:** While iOS is secure, it is also more restrictive when it comes to customization. For instance, the iOS App Store limits the type of VPN protocols or additional features that a free VPN can offer. Android, on the other hand, allows more flexibility with VPN configuration, giving users the ability to tweak advanced settings like routing, DNS settings, and more. So, while iOS offers a more user-friendly experience, Android users typically have more control over their VPN settings.

# 2. Cross-Platform Compatibility

Many VPN providers offer services that can be used across multiple devices and platforms. Free VPNs for iOS can work seamlessly with iPhones and iPads, but if you want to use the same VPN on other devices like laptops or smart TVs, you'll find that some free VPNs restrict cross-platform compatibility. Many free VPNs only allow one device connection at a time, whereas paid versions might support multiple devices simultaneously.

* **iOS vs. Android:** Android users generally enjoy greater flexibility when it comes to VPN customization and compatibility with apps and services. Free VPNs for Android tend to offer more options in terms of protocols and manual configurations, which iOS doesn't always allow due to its more closed ecosystem. However, iOS devices tend to have better optimized VPN apps in terms of ease of use and integration.
* **Access to Content:** Whether you’re using a VPN on an iOS device or another platform like Android or Windows, a VPN can help you bypass geo-restrictions and access content that is unavailable in your region. However, the experience of accessing content may differ slightly. For example, streaming services like Netflix or Hulu might perform differently on iOS versus Android when using free VPNs. The differences are often due to the VPN server locations and bandwidth limits imposed on free users. Nonetheless, a free VPN can still help you access content across all platforms, provided the service has reliable servers for streaming.

# 3. Performance: Speed and Reliability

* **Speed Issues:** One of the major drawbacks of free VPNs on any platform—iOS included—is speed. Free VPN services tend to have fewer server options, and these servers are often crowded with users, which can slow down your connection. However, the impact of this issue might be more noticeable on iOS compared to other platforms because of iOS's tighter control over its apps and services, which can limit how much the app can optimize the VPN connection.
* **Optimizing Speed:** For iOS users, it's important to keep in mind that connecting to a nearby server can reduce latency and improve browsing speed. Free VPNs often offer limited server locations, meaning that unless you’re located near a server, you may experience a slower connection. Android users may have a wider range of free server options, so they might experience better performance in terms of speed and latency.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid When Using a Free VPN for iOS**

While free VPNs can provide a good level of security for general browsing, there are a few mistakes that users often make that can compromise their online privacy and the effectiveness of their VPN connection. To help you avoid these pitfalls, let's explore some common mistakes to steer clear of:

# 1. Choosing an Untrustworthy VPN Provider

One of the biggest risks with free VPNs is choosing an untrustworthy provider. Some free VPN services collect and sell your data to third parties, undermining the very privacy that you're trying to protect. Always make sure to choose a VPN provider with a transparent privacy policy that explicitly states they don’t log or sell your data. It’s important to research reviews and see what experts say about the VPN’s security features before downloading.

# 2. Overloading the VPN with High-Bandwidth Activities

Free VPNs often have data limits and slower speeds, which can be a problem if you're trying to stream video, download large files, or engage in other high-bandwidth activities. Trying to do these activities on a free VPN could result in slow speeds or even data overage charges. If you need a VPN for streaming or frequent large downloads, consider limiting your use of a free VPN or opting for a paid version that offers unlimited bandwidth and better speeds.

# 3. Failing to Enable Kill Switch

Many premium VPNs offer a kill switch feature, which disconnects you from the internet if your VPN connection drops unexpectedly. Unfortunately, many free VPNs for iOS don’t come with this feature, which can be a security risk if your connection is interrupted. If you're using a free VPN that doesn’t offer this feature, it's best to avoid any sensitive activities (such as online banking or shopping) while connected to the VPN. A kill switch ensures that your data doesn’t leak in the event of a dropped connection.

# 4. Not Checking for DNS Leaks

DNS leaks occur when your device continues to use your ISP’s DNS servers even while connected to a VPN. This can expose your real IP address and browsing activities. While some free VPNs for iOS have DNS leak protection, others may not, which can compromise your privacy. Regularly check for DNS leaks by using online tools to ensure that your VPN is functioning as it should. If you notice any leaks, try switching to a different server or VPN provider that offers better leak protection.

# 5. Overlooking VPN App Permissions

Free VPN apps, like any other app, may ask for permissions that aren’t necessary for the VPN’s functionality. Always check the permissions the VPN app requests before allowing access. If a free VPN app is asking for unnecessary access to your contacts, photos, or other sensitive data, it could be a red flag. Stick with VPN providers that only ask for the permissions necessary to operate the service.

By avoiding these common mistakes, you can maximize your security and privacy while using a free VPN on your iOS device.

**The Future of VPNs on iOS Devices**

As privacy concerns continue to grow and more people become aware of the risks of online tracking, the demand for VPNs is expected to rise. The future of VPNs on iOS devices is bright, with advancements in technology making VPNs even more secure, user-friendly, and powerful. Here’s what we can expect in the near future:

# 1. AI and Machine Learning Integration

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly being integrated into cybersecurity tools, including VPNs. These technologies can help VPNs adapt to changing online threats, identify unusual activity, and optimize server connections. In the future, iOS VPNs might utilize AI to enhance security, automatically select the best server for optimal speed, and detect potential data leaks or breaches more efficiently.

# 2. Better Encryption Standards

Encryption standards are likely to become even more advanced, ensuring that your internet traffic is always secure. While AES-256 encryption is already highly secure, future iOS VPNs might adopt next-generation encryption protocols to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats. These improvements will make it even more difficult for hackers, governments, or advertisers to intercept your data.

# 3. Increased Focus on Privacy

With growing awareness of the importance of online privacy, VPN providers are expected to place even greater emphasis on protecting user data. Many free VPNs may adopt stricter no-logs policies and become more transparent about their data practices. Additionally, user control over personal data is expected to increase, allowing iOS users to have more say over what data is collected and stored.

# 4. 5G and VPN Integration

The rise of 5G networks will likely change how VPNs function on mobile devices. With significantly faster internet speeds, VPNs will need to optimize their services for 5G networks to ensure that speeds remain fast and secure while maintaining privacy. This could mean better streaming, faster downloads, and more reliable VPN connections across iOS devices.

# 5. More Advanced Free VPN Options

As VPN usage continues to rise, we may see more advanced features being included in free VPN services for iOS. For instance, free VPN providers might offer additional server locations, improved speeds, and more secure protocols without compromising user data. This would provide more options for users who prefer not to pay for a premium VPN service.

In the future, VPNs on iOS are likely to become even more user-friendly, secure, and feature-rich, helping users maintain their privacy in an increasingly connected world.

**Conclusion**

A **free VPN for iOS** is an essential tool for protecting your privacy, securing your online activities, and accessing geo-blocked content. While free VPNs may have limitations in terms of speed, bandwidth, and server availability, they still offer significant benefits for users who are looking for a cost-effective way to enhance their online security. However, it’s essential to select a reputable VPN provider that values your privacy, uses strong encryption, and doesn’t log your data.

As we’ve discussed, free VPNs for iOS can be a great solution for everyday browsing and basic security, but users who need more advanced features, better performance, or additional privacy may want to consider premium options. Regardless of your choice, a VPN can go a long way in safeguarding your personal information, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.",1,1734258897.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False
1hepywu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1hepywu/christmas_dilemma/,Christmas Dilemma ,"Hi,

I'm pretty confused about how to handle Christmas after my eldest child injured my youngest child.

Last week, my daughter (10yo) was in the living studying and my son (4yo) wanted to see what she was doing. At the time, my daughter was watching a short online maths tutorial. I was in and out of the living room and kitchen keeping an eye on things.

The next thing I know, my daughter had pushed him away (she was sitting down at the time, and my son was standing next to her) and she must have pushed him with force, as he hit his mouth on our coffee table (which is wooden, with rounded edges) and knocked one of his front teeth loose. This happened at 6pm, so we spent the evening dealing with A&E etc. (who couldn't do anything to help) and ultimately managed to get an emergency dentist appointment the following morning. The dentist advised that we leave the tooth and revisit for an x-ray after 2 weeks (which is about to take place). In all likelihood, my son's tooth will fall out in the coming weeks and he'll be left with a gap until his adult tooth comes through. It's obviously been a traumatic experience for him and he's not yet able to eat solid foods. We don't know whether he'll still need to have the tooth removed after the x-ray.

I know my daughter didn't mean to cause such a serious injury, but at the same time it's completely unacceptable that she pushed her younger brother, especially given the difference in age and height. 

My wife and I have had several conversations with our daughter about what has happened, we've taken away her screentime privileges.

But.....what to do about Christmas? Our son has already highlighted that his big sister ""had behaviour last week"" and that Santa won't bring her any presents. Meanwhile, my daughter is trying to carry on as if nothing happened and she's even written a letter to Santa with a long list of toys - she already knows the reality of 'Christmas magic' and she's not just playing along for her younger brother, she has used the whole thing to try to reinforce that she's still getting presents.

Overall, our daughter just hasn't shown a great deal of empathy for her brother and it's disappointing that she doesn't seem to recognise the seriousness of lashing out at him. 

Before the incident last week, we'd already bought them a games console as a joint Christmas present, plus some stocking fillers for each of them.  At this point, I'm not sure whether to carry on with Christmas as planned and deal with my daughter's behaviour separately, or keep the main present and return her stocking fillers, or give the games console to my son only (he was very brave about the whole incident last week, and should he miss out on the main present because of his sister's actions?), or do something else entirely?

Any thoughts or advice would be welcome!

He is praying, doing umrah every year and actively looking to get married.

A month ago he got very busy (he immediately got a new job after he got back from umrah, guess his duas are being accepted) and he started to distance himself.

He deactivated socials, but I did try to reach out few times (we have each other numbers), but he would just like my message and I backed off and that was it.

I understand this is the decision of Allah and I accept it.

He is also wealthy, successful man, so he has a lot of options, he can have most beautiful women if he wants and they are throwing themself onto him, so I also understand he will not reach out to me (hijab wearing, not extraordinary beauty) and I also accept that. 

BUT - as you may think, I cannot stop thinking about him. 

I started no contact and I prayed istikhara multiple times to Allah to remove the feelings, but 1 month later, I am in the same place. 

I really, really thought he is the one, but now I am in a position where I am asking myself - What can I ask Allah to help me?

To increase prayers to forget it, another istikhara - but what can I ask Allah since I don’t have a decision?

Thank you sisters ♥️

**EDIT** Last week I asked Allah for a sign and ability to see it as a sign when it comes and I was thinking I will see a white cat, someone will tell me something but nothing happened. 

Later that day I got a coffee with one friend and she was talking about her friend who recently got married. I asked how did they meet (like you would usually ask) and she said through instagram, nothing special.

She continued to speak and said - But guess what was interesting, he (the groom) once disappeared for 3 months(went to another country) because of work and she (the bride) lost all hopes although she liked him very much.

3 months later he reached out and they married within 6 months.

That was the moment I was left with open mouth because I thought “this is the sign” and I thought “be patient, do not rush”.



Sooo, this is what’s holding my hope. 


I have nothing from him, not a word, but I want to move on if he is not the one.

First, I take out the nozzle, spit in the canister, stick the nozzle in my vagina, rub it between my cheeks, spit in the coffee once more, place the nozzle in the canister and finally serve it. 

Just kidding. As much as I would love, love, love to do that, like I seriously cannot convey my yearning to brew the Forbidden Coffee... I did something far less sinister. I simply switched their regular coffee for decaf, meaning their drive back to Wisconsin will be long and treacherous come checkout at noon. Anyone who wants regular decaf will be drinking the leftovers from whatever batch I just made. Not fresh in any manner. There's a lesson to be learnt about staying up late and drinking when you should be chaperoning your children. Hopefully they learn it today. The other half of the guests are just locals here to party, so I don't feel bad about ruining their day either. ",10,1734257996.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,5,0.68,False

I (41F) have a coworker (44M) who I have been working with for almost 2 yrs. At first he was one of my favorite people, since he was the office jokester who always made us laugh and broke the ice in the meetings. I also found out he knows my partner socially. Then after awhile I realised I was a victim of a long bullying campaign by my former superior (43F) and the director of the organisation (43F). Both of them are his close friends and they all went to school together. The director brought both into this organisation. The campaign against me included multifaceted discrimination and harrassment, ultimately by means of major abuse of power. it resulted in multiple deliberate atempts to exclude me from the team social garherings, spreading rumors/criticizing me behind my back at those gatherings and various coffee meetings. Excluding me from all major outings through sceduling etc. They actively discredited my work on regular basis for more than 6 months. Took credit for good work, but scapegoated me when mistakes were done without exception. My former bosses (both had since quit and left organisation due to multiple serious ""mistakes"" across a longer period of time) also threatened me with retaliation (not renewing my contract) and said I am second rang worker to my face. when things came to light they tried to manufacture evidence to cover their ass and make me look like too sensitive, immature and incapable in case I reported them. I should say important part of this context is that I am neurodivergent and have struggled with mental health and past trauma with bullying my whole life. I have ptsd and adhd, am autistic, with ocd tendencies, compulsions and tics, which at this age I can mask well enough on a good day, but they show a lot when under stress. 

Anyway, to the crux of the matter - they are obviously not a problem anymore, they left organisation. Voluntarily resigned, I should ad. But he stayed and eventough we are not directly requiered to cooperate, he is nevertheless present there. I tried to be nice or at least civil to him, but I just cant forget how he treated me. When they were not around he was normal and friendly, but then ignored me and was cold to me in their presence. Probably because he has no spine. I dont think he is evil, but I hate bystanders as much as bullies, maby more, and he is majorly triggering to me, when we are forced to interact. Mostly I ignore him, which some others (and him also) percieve as rude and unkind. They think I should move on. AITA?

Edit: He also hasn't apologized, but nor have I confronted him about this. I fear conftontations and am working on boundry setting. Maby this is why I am an AH, I dont know.

TL/DR: coworker stood by as his friends and my former bosses bullied and disctiminated against me, now says Im rude for not saying Hallo when we meet in the hallway.
