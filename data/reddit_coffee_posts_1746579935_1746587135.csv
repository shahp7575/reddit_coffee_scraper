Right from the start he was very insistent on wanting to get to know me outside of sex (suggesting coffee and lunch dates), where as I was a little hesitant, given the age gap. I figured I'd let him have his Mrs Robinson moment, we saw each other in a bootycall type situation about 3 times and to be honest he really grew on me. He was emotionally mature, good at verbalising his feelings, intelligent, funny, kind, obviously attractive, and seemed very, very into me. Probably the most doting partner I've ever been with. He kept pushing it towards more of a hangout type situation and I eventually decided that I also wanted to get to know him better. We had a date at mine last week, drank wine, watched a few movies, did the R18 stuff, and just generally talked. It was really nice and really intimate. Eskimo kisses, showering together, hand holding, just really couply stuff. 

We'd had a very brief conversation at the start of seeing each other where he asked whether I wanted a relationship, I said I'm not making a relationship a goal as I have a million other things to focus on, but I'm open to it if something worthwhile comes up. He said he doesn't want a relationship. 

Last week he asked me again if I'm looking for a relationship. I gave the same response, I'm not opposed to one but I'm not centering relationships in my life. Its just not something I have a lot of control over, so I'm focused on my career and if a relationship pops up, great.

We normally text like 1-2 times a week, but last week that increased a bit. He said he misses me. He messages me thursday to say he'll touch base before the weekend, Friday morning he says he'll message me later.

Than crickets. Its now Wednesday. 

He has a lot going on, balancing post grad study, a job and a very healthy social life, but I just feel like I've been here before, I know this game, and I know what this silence means. Especially given his age and the ""I don't want a relationship right now"" line.

My friends think I'm over reacting and/or that maybe somethings happened. They say not to give up on it yet that he might still want to talk to me.

I feel exhausted by this being a repeated theme in my dating life, and I'm struggling to convince myself to even send a check in message, because I feel like every time its gotten to this point all thats led to is them playing more of the hot/cold game. I almost feel like holding on emotionally is only going to lead to more power games down the track, and I feel like I'm already just grieving it and trying to let it go.

I absolutely panic around birthdays/holidays/etc. 

My mom does not like typical gifts you would find on lists of things to get. She does not want kitchen items (finds it insulting), anything scented or bath/spa related, ""upgrades"" for current items (says she likes what she has already), hates gift cards, doesn't like to read, doesn't travel, doesn't drink coffee/tea/alcohol - you get the picture.  As an example of gifting issues, last year she talked about a game from the 60s she played as a kid and how much she'd love to play it again. I found it on EBay and got it for her. The only comment she made was ""wow these are different colors than the game I played"". Other items I've gotten such as a photo printer have gone unused.

Batch: C924

Proof: 125.1

Age: NAS though assumed to be 6-8 years old

Mashbill: 68% corn, 20% wheat, 12% malted barley

Price: $65

Nose: it’s got a bit of sour funk on the nose, almost a bit like a Wild Turkey 101. My nosing notes are never very good (I think Covid messed something up) so I’ll leave it at that. 

Palate: first sip is very sweet, and then some bitter spicy oak on the back end. Further sips reveal brown sugar, honey, and dark chocolate. There’s definitely a spicy (but not quite bitter) oak on the back end that reminds me a bit of freshly ground white peppercorns. A bit of coffee / mocha as well. 

Finish: medium length, nothing to write home about, but not bad. It’s got good viscosity and is not at all watery. 

Rating: 7.5/10. It’s a solid barrel proof wheater and I like the flavors a lot. I think I paid $65 for it so that’s decent value. One day I’ll try a Maker’s Mark Cask Strength or a 46 Cask Strength to have a comparison point for a similarly priced barrel proof wheated bourbon (never gonna see Weller Full Proof lol)

1kgn4an,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1kgn4an/my_thoughts_on_star_citizen_backer_since_2013/,My Thoughts on Star Citizen - Backer Since 2013,"# Brief Background

I backed Star Citizen way back in 2013/2014 as a young, naïve 21/22 year old that grew up on RPGs and had a special love for *Wing Commander*, *Starlancer,* and *Freelancer*. I didn't expect too much, but I certainly did expect SQ42 to be out by 2016 instead of 2026. That being said, I can't say I'm entirely dissatisfied, and I'll explain why, but I thought it was important to note I've played the game through most of its phases on and off for the last 12 years.

# Star Citizen — The Idea

The thing that captured me about Star Citizen was the *idea* of it. It wasn't the fantastical elements or the crazy scope or even the crazy Fleet Battle possibilities (at least, not initially). In fact, it was the idea of *exploring*. See, if you've played *Freelancer,* then you know exactly what I'm talking about, especially with the *Discovery* mod. Exploration is such a cool and immersive part of space sims, and games like *Elite: Dangerous* really nail this down.

So my thought was that, with someone as ambitious as Chris Roberts at the helm, Star Citizen would be a dream come true for boldly going where no one has gone before. **StarEngine** and **Genesis** made this even more exciting, and the idea of **StarChitect** and **StarSim** seemed to be painting a universe of possibility where the only limits of *discovery*—heh, I couldn't resist—was your own imagination. I envisioned conquering Star Systems, founding colonies, planting my Org's flag across the frontier of the Cosmos, and becoming a happy little ~~despot~~ Administrator in some fledgling frontier system.

Then came the **1.0** release view, and my Kirk Palpatine dreams ended up looking like pure fantasy after all.

I'm sure exploration will be scratched in the eventual **1.X** content drops with new systems and more using **StarChitect**, but the fantasy of it all firmly went down in flames.

Despite this however, the idea of Star Citizen has not lost its hold on me.

The *idea*.

It's hard, sometimes, to really remember why it is that so many of us bought into this game—and I know there are a *myriad* of reasons for you all—in the first place. Pessimism, cynicism, the oopsies of CIG's repeated mismanagement of resources, development, et cetera, have all pooled together to create a playerbase that is simultaneously rabidly supportive and viciously critical. However, I think it's important to remember that at some point, before all the negativity, the anger, the disappointment, the missed deadlines—there was a simpler element to why we invested.

The idea.

The dream.

The *possibility.*

Which brings me, after that little ramble, to my actual thoughts on the state of the game.

# Star Citizen — The Reality

Star Citizen is a flawed product in many ways, and a surprisingly full-bodied one in others.

The positives, of course, are its flight system, the visceral nature of combat both in space and on the ground, the attention to detail around ship design, articulation, special effects, physics, dynamic damage (sort of), and the very real and punishing realities of velocity and inertia in the deep black. The gameplay loops, or the current incarnation of them, provide some semblance of fulfilling repetition. Diggy diggy hole remains diggy diggy hole, and for the truly wealth-driven among us, hauling and piracy both represent different but comparable means of achieving our space tycoon dreams.

That being said, it is when you look for the *next step* that things become more dicey.

There's only so many times you can Bounty Hunt in an asteroid belt before it feels samey, there's only so many ships you can buy with hard-won UEC before it feels like a relentless bore. There are only so many Hathor Sites, Executive Hangars, and Contested Zones you can fight over before it all starts to feel a little stale. That isn't to knock anyone who enjoys those playstyles, and I'm certainly not deriding the content. Still, in my *personal* opinion, two major elements are missing that would really compel me to continue logging in.

Player population and a living economy.

Right now, and I'm sure this is a contentious viewpoint, I believe the most bitter disappointment about Star Citizen—no, it isn't Master Modes, you Khornate Berserkers—is the lack of *community* within the living world. Now, please don't confuse that as an indictment of the player base, or even an indictment of the game itself. This is, candidly, a result of the path toward release—but remains a massive point of discontent for me personally.

I am a D&D forever-DM, an amateur author, and more than anything else, an *avid* roleplayer. Every game I play, I dabble in roleplay, whether it's my 3,500+ mod Skyrim playthroughs, various MMOs, or other avenues of pursuit—I love to immerse myself in the game world. For me, this is never better highlighted than with the interaction of players with players. Countless times I've thought of making a ""Friend me, let's build an artificial roleplay Shard!"" reddit post, but I chickened out each time—primarily due to my own pessimism for the concept's popularity, and partially due to concerns of trolling, admittedly.

But I digress.

Population and Economy. Without these elements, even before Base Building, Crafting, Space Stations, et cetera, there remains a poignant hole in the simulation of Star Citizen's living universe. Context, consequence, and compelling interactions fall short because there is no active investment among players. I want to go to MicroTech, or CRU-L1, or Orison, or ArcCorp and offer escort services to trading barons, negotiate safe conduct deals with renegades, and hunt down notorious pirate gangs. I want a living universe where transactional interaction *breeds* immersion, and where UEC lives and breathes in Star Citizen.

I don't need the fully realized FOIP-VOIP combination, but it certainly would be nice to have the Org updates and new **MobiGlass** functionality put into the game, so that we *can* have a living universe. Frankly, the lack of something as simple as Org tags and dyeable armor/applyable Org colours **13 years on** is bewildering. It remains my largest point of frustration around Star Citizen: the lack of player identity in the 'Verse and the lack of population counts and fundamental systems required for a living universe.

With that said, let's pivot back to some hopium.

**Rich Tyrer** showed us some fantastic things at **CitizenCon 2954,** and while I remain, as always, cautiously optimistic, I have to say that I do believe Star Citizen in its current state is closer to release than it's ever been.

""Well, of course it is, idiot, it's been 13 years.""

Fair enough, but that was not my point!

The difference in developmental focus and priority these past months compared to the last decade is notable. The fixation on QoL, the streamlined (somewhat) pipeline for ship release, and the obvious sprint toward a 2026 SQ42 release (I know, I know) remain points of considerable noblebright in a grimdark development canvas. I'm fast-approaching my mid-thirties at an alarming rate, and with children in the near future looking highly possible, part of me wonders if I'm simply walking the path so that my heirs can eventually run. Will it be my children that actually end up experiencing the fantastical world that I dreamt of as a younger man? The thought both disturbs me and has an element of poetic satisfaction to it.

""I held the line,"" I'll say to them, while imagining the mocking laughter of the millions of backers that understand how copium-infused that statement is. ""I held the line so that you could fly the stars.""

My hope is that I will instead welcome my kids into a world that has already met and exceeded my expectations, and have a game that my partner and I can play together—she does love Star Citizen—while teaching our children how to play the virtual shares market. My hope is that in 2028, I'll be playing the Main Story, traversing from Stanton, to Terra, to Castra, and exploring the early examples of the vast might of the UEE. My hope, my fellow Citizens, is that I'll meet you all in regional mega-shards and exchange fire, UEC, and Cruz Luxes while arguing over which variant of the Lightning is better to fly despite its atrocious handling.

Whatever the future brings, my view on Star Citizen is one of optimism, not because I choose to ignore the facts, but because I want, I *desperately* want to believe in spite of them. My view on Star Citizen is that it is a game made by dreamers, for dreamers, to bring us in touch with the Universe the same way that Lucas brought us in touch with the Force. It is an imperfect game, a flawed game, a game plagued by poor choices and idealistic and ambitious choices—but one I cannot help but come back to, year after year, patch after patch, because of the endless hope that one day I will sail the stars, full-body VR and all.

I want that for all of you. I want that for my kids. I want that for those who passed before they could experience it.

So, 12 years on, I continue to hope.

And when I see you from the bridge of my *Javelin*, sipping my coffee while my son or daughter destroys my Engineering presets to the alarm of my crew, I hope you'll wave and say, ""Hey, man. We did it. *We held the line.*""",3,1746586563.0,starcitizen,0,0.67,False

1. Why did Billy spontaneously abandon his family for the wolf? I never got why he had such an extreme admiration for the wolf. And his relationship with his family seemed decent, definitely not enough to run away like that for a stray wolf. 

  
2. Who killed Billy and Boyd's parents? Was it the man at the start of the book who asked for coffee and food? 

  
3. Why did Boyd run away? Was it because he never forgave Billy? 

  
4. Having run away, why did Boyd suddenly become a gunslinger? I never got the vibe he had violent ideas in his head. He never resembled the Kid from Blood Meridian in any way.

I have been physically unwell due to binge eating bad food for months. Ive put on a lot of weight, maybe 10kg. My stomach aches from gorging myself daily.

I just had my healthy breakfast and coffee when I saw the free snack bowl provided by my hostel in front of me. I told myself I didn't need them, I already felt full.

I had one anyway. I told myself one was okay. But then I had more. And then I had more.

6 cookies in total. By the 5th I was tearing up. I kept eating as I cried. And it's not about the cookies. This is far from a large binge for me. It's about how food has taken over my life. I want to eat all the time: when I'm full, when I'm not full; when I'm sick, when I'm not sick.

I feel trapped in this. I can't look at my changing body in the mirror. I walk past the mirror, eyes averted, to get another quick fix from the kitchen. 

There is self-blame, there is anger with myself, guilt, loathing. I'm not entirely sure that this is fair. I am a victim of this, as well as the perpetrator.

I’m mostly on a neutral baseline I suppose?? The upside is, strangely, for now, my anxiety is actually a lot less. 

I know this medication takes a couple weeks to work out side effects, so I’m gonna keep going since it’s not exactly unbearable. Just a little inconvenient I guess?

Neary tried to convince the both of them that the Commodore's plan would work and that they would make more money with less hassles, but Fleming didn't want to go along with it because he was loyal to Nucky, didn't want him to go to jail, was content with the money he was making with Nucky in charge, and brought up the road appropriations that they were all in on together being Nucky's deal.  O'Neil folded right away, but when Fleming refused to go along, Neary told him that ""Anybody who didn't sign on, he'll be lucky to work the boards with a broom and a dustpan.""

In the beginning of S3E1, after Gyp Rosetti beat the man to death over 3-in-1, the following scene showed a kid running on the boardwalk, but before he picked up the coffee and breakfast for Nucky and his men, he passed the former ward boss Boyd in his last appearance on the show sweeping the boards with a broom and a dustpan.  

Obviously, Nucky didn't want anyone who was part of the plot against him to remain in power, but it's ironic how Boyd ends up doing exactly what Neary told Fleming he would be doing while Fleming was rewarded for his loyalty with a promotion from ward boss to county treasurer.

context: I work at a coffee shop and used to have a pair of white nokwol platform sneakers and lamoda platform zip up ankle boots. 

my white platforms needed to be retired because they were dirty and the soles were disintegrating. the lamoda boots were new but cracked on the platform (😐). sooo, I finally convinced myself to splurge the money on new rocks (tanks) since I’ve wanted them for years but have money anxiety and didn’t want to spend the $$$. thus currently my new rocks are the only shoes I have to wear to work (the only other shoes I own are trail running shoes, hiking boots and chacos/teva sandals and slides which I can’t wear to work at the coffee shop). I love them but they don’t go with every outfit and also I’m getting tired of wearing only those shoes to work every day (they’re a bit heavy after 9-10 hour long shifts). urgg this is such a first world problem, I apologize, but I ask nonetheless.. 

I’ve been looking at Buffalo London platform sneakers/loafers, doc marten zebzags, skechers jammers, birkenstock clogs, demonias, or converse one star or cruise sneakers or converse all star platforms.

Grocery store, coffee shop, indoor playground, park, discount store, and restaurants. We have always had one operable vehicle and once or twice a month, I’d drive to a shopping center to walk around.

We moved two years ago. My driving is restricted now, thanks to health issues, and nothing is within walking distance other than a gas station. We order groceries and doordash dinner about 4 times each pay period. It is an exorbitant waste of money. I am cooped up in the house almost the entire month, and have suggested multiple times that I can place the order and go pick it up. Usually with that suggestion the conversation fizzles, he brings up my health issues (which haven’t flared up since February), or deflects and we order delivery anyway.

When I last brought this up, he rolled his eyes and said families don’t go out that often. I tried to cut him off and say I wasn’t asking for an outing, but he complained about me being high maintenance and said we aren’t rich. Which, no shit sherlock, but the money we spend on delivery fees, tips, and doordash prices would open the budget for A LOT.

1kgmo1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kgmo1f/aio_girlfriend_went_through_my_phone/,"AIO, girlfriend went through my phone","To make a long story somewhat short, one Sunday morning, I (25M) woke up wondering where my gf (28) was. After a while of laying in bed, she came and sat down, obviously distressed and said “I need to tell you something”

I listened while she explained that she had gone through my phone while I slept the night before. She brought up text messages with a female friend of mine, which we will get to later. 

At this point I was upset about her going through my phone, and hardly listened to her other complains before leaving the house to go clear my head. 

To make a long story short, I’m a recovering addict/alcoholic. Due to strange circumstances, BEFORE my gf and I were dating, I “sponsored” a good friend of mine, that happened to be a girl. We have never made any sort of advance to each other, never had romantic feelings, and it was always platonic. 

I helped her out when she first got sober, and just generally supported her the way friends do. I took her to her first AA meeting and we are good friends. She is also married, I should point out. 

My gf has *always* resented that a little bit, usually being quiet and aloof for at least a day whenever I went to see her. Usually we meet at a chicken chef for coffee. 

After lots of fighting, and couples therapy the reason given for going through my phone was because:

My gf has a friend who *is* married and was *just* cheated on by her husband after having several children. I had gone through something very hard last year, and while I was working through that, my gf and I were distant. All her girl friends told her that the most likely explanation (of course) is that I was cheating. 

My girlfriend worked very hard through text messages and fights after admitting to going through my phone to make it seem like I was cheating on her, or at least being very inappropriate with my female friend and stepping outside relationship boundaries. 

She admitted later in therapy that I’ve never given her any reason to think I was being unfaithful, nor to suspect it. 

For a while, I didn’t think it was something I could move past. She consistently downplayed the fact that I was angry about her going through my phone and used the classic “you’re upset so you must be hiding something”

It took probably 2 months to get to a point where she actually apologized for it, without insinuating she had to do it. Before several counselling sessions, she said clearly that she was glad she had done it, so that she knows we’re incompatible now and not 5 years later. 

Anyways, I am still struggling with moving past this. I have *forgiven* her but it’s changed the dynamic of the relationship. For 3 years she has had unrestricted access to my phone, but it’s the fact that she snuck it while I slept, then framed me as a cheater that deserved it. 

One friend told me that they had gone through a similar thing, and after that, the relationship just never returned to baseline.

I've been trying to dial in my morning routine, so to speak. Since I switched to XR, it's been challenging to find the right order and timing of my morning food/pills. I feel like the XR isn't as effective for me, so I'm trying to play with my morning pacing of food/pills to see if maybe the pill is metabolized better on an empty stomach versus with food. I would love to hear what worked for you all while I dial this in. And, yes, I did talk to my doctor about this and she didn't really have much input. She only told me that the medication doesn't specify that it needs to be taken in any certain way (with/without food).

**Here is my morning routine:**

I have to take my Levothyroxine on an empty stomach with no food/drink, so that happens first always.

I wait my normal 30 minute waiting period after taking the Levo before having my morning coffee (2 cups while I awaken).

Recently, I've been waiting \~30 minutes until my last cup of coffee to take my adderrall.

After that, I wait another \~30 mintues to drink a protein shake. That's all I usually have for breakfast, sometimes I will also eat a banana depending on the day.

What I'm wondering is; is my coffee affecting the adderrall absorption? While I have seriously rolled back the amount of coffee I drink, I do still enoy a cup or two. Sometimes I'll just drink one cup of regular and another of decaf, it's also about the ritual and the feeling coffee gives me in the morning. Also, it helps me poop. :) I have read about vitamin C affecting efficacy, but I wasn't sure if the acid in coffee worked the same way.

I'd love to get some idea of what you all do and how your morning routines compare. Maybe I need to eat more than just a protein shake in the morning or give the coffee some more time to work through my system before I take the XR? Do you feel like it works better and lasts longer taking it after a meal?

Bonus question: My ADHD rage has been off the hook lately. Has anyone found any way to deal with that? It's like a cloud comes over me and then I can't get out of my own head.",1,1746585031.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Pycord is a modern Discord bot framework built in Python. As my first serious Python project, I created a Discord bot that helps join gamers from servers all over to connect & play games together. It simplifies the process of looking for group (LFG) for the top games.

**Target Audience**

This is a project I hope gamers use to connect to more people in order to play games together.

**Comparison**

All the current LFG bots I've seen either are decommissioned or simply do not work. Raid Event Organizer is the closest bot I could find with popularity.

What have I gotten myself into?,"Right now, I’m sitting at Toronto Pearson Airport, holding my passport and a one-way ticket to Shanghai. My hands are a little shaky—not from the coffee, but from a weird mix of excitement and anxiety.

This is my first time traveling to China, and honestly, I have no idea what to expect. Western media paints one picture, social media paints another, and the truth? I guess I’m about to find that out for myself.

I’ve heard it all—from “China is incredibly safe and efficient” to “Get ready for culture shock.” I’ve read stories about street food that changed lives, tech so advanced it makes the West look like the Stone Age, and toilets that… well, you know.

I’m not going as part of a tour group. No travel agency. Just me, my backpack, a loose itinerary, and a whole lot of curiosity. My plan is to document everything—every unexpected kindness, awkward encounter, surprising discovery, and (hopefully not) travel fail.

First stop: Shanghai. After that? Who knows. Chengdu, Xi’an, maybe some lesser-known places too. If you’ve been, tell me: what blew your mind? What should I absolutely not miss? What should I be prepared for?

I’ll be posting updates as I go—like a mini travel journal slash reality check of what it’s really like to explore China in 2025 as a solo traveler.

Wish me luck—and feel free to ask me anything. I’ll try to answer between noodle bowls and language barriers.",20,1746584770.0,travelchina,31,0.95,False

I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

### Background
I’m 42M, 6’1”/162 pounds, a former D1 collegiate runner (though a relative scrub on a national-champion team). I kept up running a few years after college, and ran my first marathon at Big Sur in 2007 (6th overall in 2:44, but the race was such a blur because I went out too fast and bonked so that I didn’t feel like I made the most of the experience). I stopped running much in 2010 when I got injured but couldn’t afford physical therapy. I had a few false starts over the years, but calf issues would crop up. In December 2023, I had what I like to think of as a “positive mid-life crisis” as I realized I wasn’t actually a runner anymore, and at 41 I  may never be one again unless I changed things, urgently! I committed myself to getting back into running shape, and within 12 weeks went from running 50 miles in all of 2023 to running 50+ miles a week… and promptly got a stress fracture in my foot. Maybe a bit too quick of a rampup! After that healed, I was a bit more careful and slowly started to build back my fitness and lose my extra weight in a long buildup to my hometown Baltimore Marathon in October 2024 (mostly following Pfitz 18/55 peaking in the 60’s mpw). I needed a lot of PT appointments for calf and hamstring issues, but made it to the startline. That race went fantastic, giving it my all to run 2:47. I signed up for another race to keep the psyche up, and chose Big Sur again to try to fully appreciate the Big Sur beauty in a way I missed in 2007.

### Training
After the Baltimore marathon, I had a nice base-building phase in the fall to get ready for a full Pfitz 18/70 cycle, which kicked off around Christmas. The first 5 weeks went great... until I suddenly became the sickest I have ever been in my life. I thought it was just a nasty cold until it got to the point where I could barely breathe, due to what turned out to be a massive clot of bacteria in my lungs (pneumonia). I’m sure it would have killed me in a few days if left alone—thank goodness for the invention of antibiotics! I had lost 12 pounds in 7 days (down to 150lb), was hacking up foul material for weeks, and my heart rate was through the roof when walking up the stairs. Basically, once cleared by my doctor torun again, I was starting back at fitness-square one with just 9 weeks to go to the race. The first weeks back of ~25mi felt way harder than any 60+ mpw weeks I’ve done. I purely focused on “easy” base running, but my heart rate would still quickly jump to LT rate or above! Over the next few weeks, I focused on building back up a long run and getting a bit of LT work (got in 4 long runs over 19mi with hills and pacework and worked my LT pace from 6:20 down to 5:50/mi) and peaked at 72mi 3 weeks before the race. I was also afflicted with, <ahem> “runner’s trot” issues from the antibiotics for the rest of the training cycle (and was very worried about how many pit-stops I might need during the race!). Overall, I still felt weaker than I had in mid-January, but felt strong enough to put in a good effort, whatever that pace may be. I set a goal of top 25 overall to give me something a little scary but possible to shoot for, especially since the racetimes are so dependent upon the conditions.

### Pre-race
My family flew to California the week before the race for Spring Break/grandparent time for the kids.Did my final tuneup workout at 5:45/mi pace and finally starting feeling like my old pre-sickness self. We went down to Monterey the day before the race, and my kids went to the aquarium with grandparents while I went to the expo and did a shakeout. Had an early dinner of sea-bass and risotto, and was asleep by 9pm. Woke up at 3am to scarf down a banana and bagel with PB&J and a Skratch labs high carb drink. Was dropped off at the bus at 4am and stared at the darkness as we traveled the disturbingly long way to the start line. I thought: “Am I really going to racing this whole way back?!?”. Had a Gu stroopwaffel and coffee at 5:30, a 5minute warmup jog in the rain, took a gu and lined up a couple rows back from the front of Corral A.
Race Outfit: Nike aeroswift singlet, Bandit Superbeam quartertights, alphafly 3’s.
Race Nutrition: gu 15min before start, 160g Maurten’s at 4.8mi and 12mi, and a 100g Maurten’s Caff at ~17mi. I grabbed a cup on Nuun’s drink mixture at every water stop. Didn’t bonk!

### Race
Since I had no real idea of my ultimate fitness, I went totally by feel through the ups and downs of the beautiful, wet, windy, hilly course! Started with 4 downhill in foggy redwoods, then cutting to the coast with a gentle uphill with a mighty headwind, quick downhill then a steep 2mile climb to hurricane point, Bixby Bridge, and many miles of rolling hills on the way to Carmel. Felt like I had Ireland’s pastoral hills on the right and Kauai’s sea cliffs on the left! Then rolling cambered hills by rich peoples’ homes in the Carmel Highlands, then on to the finish (though the last section was a bit of a blur to be honest). I started near the front of the field and tried to stay relaxed through the first downhill miles. In my 40’s, it takes longer for my heart rate to ramp up and to be able to handle faster paces, so I focused on being smooth (avoiding needless braking on the downhills) with controlled breathing.  Once warmed up and onto the flats and gentle uphills of miles 5-9, I upped the perceived effort into the headwind as we headed to the coast and pulled away from the runners nearby and was soon basically alone with a big gap ahead and behind (I was basically alone in the marathon from miles 7-23). I focused on keeping my heart rate under 160 on the hills to keep from burning myself out too early (like I had done in 2007). The 2 mile Hurricane Point climb itself wasn’t too bad, especially with a much gentler 2nd mile. I was well-prepared from my hilly long runs to handle Hurricane point; rather I saved all of my groans for the random hills thrown in all over the course that didn’t even seem to exist on the course map’s elevation profile. I came through the halfway point at 1:22-high and felt good ticking off the miles for a while, before the cumulative downhill pounding on the quads really started to set in. My left hamstring, right calf and especially left quad started to bark at me around miles 16-18, to where I preferred the uphills to the downhills the rest of the race! I knew the total elevation gain is ~+2100ft, so I tried to trick myself into relishing the uphills, since each step up was another foot of elevation chopped off the to-do list. On the other hand, every step downhill for the last 8 miles elicited a little “ow” from my quads, but stayed manageable as long as I reigned in the pace. For the last 10k of the race, I was definitely limited by how much pounding my legs could take versus my cardiovascular limit, with my heart rate dropping well below threshold. I simply tried to manage as fast as my legs themselves could take, and was pleasantly surprised that I was still clicking off low 6’s/mile (my grade-adjusted pace was ~6:10/mi for miles 18-23).
The 21-miler race started ahead of us on the same course, so I was constantly passing walkers and joggers, but couldn’t tell where any fellow marathon racers were. Evidently I passed a few in the last 10k without realizing it! At mile ~21, I recognized a fellow marathon runner up ahead, a 5-time winner here and a fellow competitor in the Master’s division, so I focused on reeling him in (he was looking like he was paying the price for a too-quick first-half). I slowly got closer, gobbling up the gap on uphills, while losing a bit on all the downhills.  I passed him on a hill around mile 23, without a fight, but then disaster struck half a mile later, when my left hamstring suddenly cramped up and stopped me dead in my tracks. The exact same muscle cramp, at the same distance as during the Baltimore marathon last fall! After about a minute and several attempts to get it stretched out, it finally released enough to get running again, though my competition had re-passed me in the meantime. Surprisingly, the hamstring felt almost-normal again by mile 24, and I could resume racing after my competition. I briefly passed him again around mile 25, but this time he was properly in on the fight and he flew by me again on the downhill, and held the lead to the final straight. I cashed in all my remaining reserves to kick hard and sprinted past him to take the master’s crown, and 4th place overall. Official time of 2:44:44, slight negative split, and tantalizingly close to the 2:44:28 I ran here as a much younger man in 2007! More importantly, I kept my head up and enjoyed the race much more than in my youth. The course was tough, but as slow as I would have thought, I could have managed maybe 5min faster on a flat, windless course. The wind and uphills were manageable, but what really cost me was the pounding downhill, especially needing to use my quads to brake a bit to maintain control on the wet, cambered roads while weaving between walkers in wobbly alphaflys (with a popped air pod to boot).

### Post-race
After the race, I high-fived my family and waddled over to the tent to collect my gear and get into warmer clothes, enjoying the runner’s high of a race well-executed. The race organizers did an amazing job all weekend, best-organized race I’ve ever done, highly recommend it for anybody’s race bucket list. I forced myself to eat a bit of food, enjoyed a beer, and soaked up the vibes until the award ceremony kicked off. I ended up with 3 award plaques, for overall place, winning my 40-44 age group, and winning the overall Master’s category (40+). I followed another dad’s example and brought up my kids with me on stage for my awards—there was a very wholesome r/daddit crossover with us 3,4,5th place finishers all with our little kids, who were beyond pumped to be in front of a crowd! My quads and hamstrings are still super-fried as I type this on the airplane, and I have to steel myself when I’m confronted with a staircase, but I’m relishing that too as a sign of mischief-well-managed! Considering how bleak things looked 9 weeks ago, I’m deliriously happy with how my body rebounded and how the race progressed. My mini mid-life crisis last year has transformed my body and attitude, and helped me recapture my love of running.  Now I need to make up for lost time while I still can and get in a few proper pneumonia-free training cycles to carry me to Boston 26 and beyond!

Last year in feb 2024, my bf Sam (38m) were dating exclusively. We were taking it slow since he had just got out of a relationship in Nov 23. One evening, Sam invites me out to watch a game at a bar with his friends. I say sure and I’ll let him know when I’m ready. I get ready, and text him to ask where to meet him. I see Sam read my text (we have read receipts on) but he did not respond. I texted him again 30 mins later. He again reads the text within 7 min but doesn’t not respond. I texted him again and same thing happens, he reads but does not respond. I am very upset.

The next day, we schedule a phone call at 6pm to work through him blatantly ditching me. He was supposed to call me, 9:30 rolls around and I text him I’m going to bed. He then calls me 30 mins later and says “he was on the phone with his parents”.

Turns out, his friend that invited him showed up to the bar way late with a date, and they were off by themselves, and Sam had been talking to Leann (37f) that whole time at the bar while he was ignoring me. From 7pm until 1:30 am. Leann and Sam went to high school together but were hardly friends. She is single at this time and he said she was flirting with him until he mentioned to her that he was dating someone (me). He and her had deep discussions about his previous relationship and she gave him unsolicited advice not to date because he had just gotten out of something. But he still was ignoring me to talk to this woman for HOURS and did not value my time by ditching me. I later found out (without him telling me) that the night after when he was supposed to call me, he was actually on the phone with Leann.

A month later she texted him to go to coffee (in my opinion she was sending out feelers to see if he was still dating me), he said “rain check” and never followed up, because he knew he had already broken my trust with her. Sam and I get through it and since then he has never ditched or lied to me and we have a great relationship. I thought that whole thing was over.

Fast forward to recent times, Sam and I are hanging out with his brother, Paul (37m), and a couple other of friends. All of a sudden, Leann shows up. Her and Paul are dating now, and I have to meet her and act like I have no idea who she is. They reconnected on instagram, but literally did not speak one word to each other during high school (coming from Sam). Sam definitely mentioned to Paul that he had run into Leann a year ago, and either way, I find it so strange Paul and her are dating when she clearly was interested in Sam first. Paul has had a couple different stories of how they reconnected, which seems suspicious to me that he keeps changing his story. i think she brother hopped when she realized Sam wasn’t interested. His first story was that she friend requested and messaged him “out of the blue”.

That night with the surprise Leann situation, I handled it well but I realllllllly don’t want to be around her moving forward. Am I overreacting for not wanting to be around her when we currently see Paul fairly often?",28,1746584187.0,AIO,21,0.97,False
1kgmcxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kgmcxi/aio_she_laughed_at_my_phone_wallpaper_on_our_date/,AIO She laughed at my phone wallpaper on our date and I can’t stop thinking about it,"Okay, so I (24M) went out with this girl (23F) for the second time last night. We matched on Hinge and it was going all right — not fantastic, but all right. Date one was a low-key coffee shop date, she seemed nice. I wouldn't say there was electricity in the air or anything, but I was hopeful. She mentioned that she liked trains, which I interpreted as a good thing (I'm seriously into transit and locomotives — I build HO scale sets and have a pretty big layout that takes up most of my living room, not boasting).

So, on the second date, we went out to a Thai place. We're conversing, everything's fine, then she says, ""Your phone buzzed — is that your wallpaper?"" and laughs.

Here's the thing: my wallpaper is a composite AI-generated image of a woman who kind of looks like a mix between Margot Robbie and an Thomas the train character, but with a diaper that has green stink lines. I made it myself on Midjourney. She's wearing a conductor's hat and standing in front of a Deutsche Bahn Class 103 train. To me, it's a beautiful image — it brings together a few of my favorite things in one. It's not that weird.

She just responds, ""Wow, okay, didn't expect that,"" and then she laughs again. It wasn't even a laugh, more of a judgy chuckle. I respond with something idiotic like, ""She's my future wife,"" and she just gives me ""Interesting taste,"" then goes back to eating.

But the rest of the date afterwards wasn't quite right. She kept looking at her phone. Didn't even finish eating her curry. She didn't even comment on the train socks I wore specially because she said she liked trains.

I walked her out to her car and she just gave me this half-hearted ""Thanks for dinner"" and then took off. She hasn't texted me since. That was 16 hours ago.

I just can't stop thinking about the moment. Why did she laugh? Why did it matter? It's just a wallpaper. People assign babies or sports teams or sunsets. I speak through digital art and yes, maybe the woman is a bit overdone, but it's not sexual. It's aesthetic. People don't get that some of us actually enjoy form and machinery.

Now I’m spiraling. Like, is this why nothing ever works out? I try to be myself and people just see it as weird. I’m polite, I paid for the meal, I opened the door for her, I even picked a restaurant with zero television screens so we could talk. But one image on my lockscreen and suddenly I’m some creep?

I know this may sound silly and dumb but it's really pissing me off. Am I overreacting for feeling completely judged and dismissed for something so trivial? Or was she superficial and looking for an excuse to dismiss me?

1kgmchy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1kgmchy/stuck_in_achievement_paralysis_this_5minute/,"Stuck in Achievement Paralysis? : This 5-Minute ""Pre-Mortem"" Trick Unlocks Your Next Level (Pro Tip) 🚀","**Hey there, MaximizeMe fam! 🌟**

Ever felt like you’re treading water in a sea of goals and dreams? You know the feeling— your to-do list is a mile long, yet you’re stuck scrolling through social media or staring blankly at your screen. Welcome to **Achievement Paralysis**! 🤦‍♂️ Been there, done that!

So what’s the secret sauce to breaking out of this funk? I’ve got a little trick up my sleeve that takes just **five minutes**: the **""Pre-Mortem"" Technique.** Sounds fancy, right? But it’s as approachable as your morning coffee ☕.

### What the Heck is a Pre-Mortem? 🤔
Imagine you’re a detective solving the mystery of why you haven't achieved that goal. Instead of waiting until the end to see what went wrong, you flip the script. You *pretend* the project has failed and ask yourself, “What went wrong?” This little mental exercise can help you dodge pitfalls before they even happen.

### Here’s how to do it in just 5 minutes:

1. **Set the Scene**  
   Picture yourself six months from now. You’ve worked on your goal, but things didn’t pan out. What went wrong? Write down all the possible reasons.

2. **Be Honest**  
   Don’t hold back! Maybe you got distracted, lacked resources, or even didn’t put in enough effort. No judgment here—just the truth! 🙈

3. **Create Solutions**  
   For each reason you’ve listed, jot down a *counter-strategy.* For example:
   - **Procrastination?** Schedule your task like an important meeting.
   - **Lack of resources?** List out what you need and plan to get it!

4. **Prioritize**  
   Now that you’ve mapped out the obstacles and solutions, pick the top three to tackle first. Keep it manageable! 🎯

5. **Take Action**  
   The goal isn’t perfection, just progress. Sometimes getting started is the hardest part, but once you do, the momentum is *chef’s kiss.* 👨‍🍳✨

### Why This Works:
- **Shift in Perspective**: By imagining failure, you prepare for challenges without the fear that often holds you back.
- **Clarity**: You get a clearer picture of what you want and what risks are involved.
- **Empowerment**: Instead of feeling stuck, you’re taking control! That’s power, right?

I recently tried this out while working on a personal project. I listed all the things that might go wrong (hello, self-doubt!), but by addressing them head-on, I felt invigorated to move forward. It’s like shedding a weight off your shoulders!

So, what do you think? Have you ever experienced achievement paralysis? How do you usually break through it? I’d love to hear your own tricks or stories! 🚀",1,1746584137.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

AMA below—I'll be as helpful as I can. In the meantime, here’s a real, unfiltered rundown of how it happened, what I learned, and what I would never do again. I assume I don't need to tell you that keywords and thumbnails are important type of thing....

# Niche & Concept

* I’m a creative director, but this YouTube channel was 100% my own project. So, I didn't come into this blind.
* Niche: Entertainment + Linguistics, specifically targeted at filmmakers and actors.
* You don’t need to be “special.” You need to be **smarter** and **more stubborn** than others in your niche. If a creative director asks ""why you? what's special about you"" - they are going nowhere.
* I analyzed my niche, before moving on in depth. See what's done by who and how, what did well, what did poorly, what didn't exist, proper keyword research, I know every competitor and all of their videos and style and numbers by heart before I dared to announce to my team, that we will have a Youtube Channel.

# Step 1: Scripting & Strategy

* **Key tip:** Never hope to “wing it” in post. You might... you also might waste footage. Write a real script and structure it ahead of time.
* I planned in **batches** of 5–8 videos per shoot day for efficiency.
* Format: 5–7 mins, catchy, fast-paced, no fluff, no midroll ads, no sales-y intros, GETO TO THE POINT.
* Hook = Deliver what the **title promises**. Think of it as ADHD-friendly: digestible, snappy, visually guided. (Not commenting on ADHD, but this is a mind set that helps me script and judge scripts. Do not expect your viewer to need to figure it out. Youtube is entertainment)
* End strong but quick—most people don’t stick around for endings anyway.

# Step 2: Recording Day

* Crew: DP, 2 cam ops, AD, PA, myself, sound—**tight skeleton crew.**
* Talent: 5 accent/language coaches + 2 guest students.
* Budget: \~$10K (pre-post).
* 10 AM crew call time, one setup for the day to save time.
* Keep morale up with good food & coffee. Drama-free sets get more done.
* Always capture **clean takes twice**, watch for bad habits (ums, lip smacks, etc.).
* Note down issues during recording so you don’t waste time later in post.

# Step 3: Editing

* This was the **longest** phase, which is normal.
* First, sync sound + footage.  (I wish we synced on the shoot day, but... for whatever reason... crew decided against, and forgot to ask me and I forgot to ask them. no drama, just ask next time!)
* Created title cards and an animated intro.
* Start with your *hardest* video. For us: the MLE (Multicultural London English) one—great topic, hard to execute. The talent had to loop at the text multiple times, stumbled, not judging, it was a hard topic, next time, choose easier things to start.
* I literally cut the printed script into chunks and glued it back into the video story from scratch. Basically, the scripts get rewritten here, which is again, normal.
* Lost 2 videos due to technical errors—lesson learned. One lost 2/3 cameras, one had an item in front of all three cameras during shooting. Boy, I was mad when I saw it in post. Camera Op was in trouble.
* Editing fully myself, Color was outsourced.

# Step 4: Uploading Strategy

* After 2 batches back to back we had 6 months of content assuming bi-weekly uploads.
* Posted in this order:
   1. Animated intro
   2. Trailer
   3. Some Shorts
   4. The weakest full video (London) - Performance issues, again, I take the blame fully!
   5. Stronger one (New York) - Visual issues
* **MLE (first)** got mixed feedback. **NY** performed great despite visual flaws.
* Left best for last.

# Step 5: Promotion = SEO + Community

* **Treat YouTube like a blog**—optimize titles, tags, descriptions. Don’t repeat tags lightly.
* We had a mailing list & student base from our language school, so we leveraged that after NY video dropped.
* Asked inner circle to search the video by keyword (to train YouTube Search), even if annoying and takes a long time. Friends are friends.
* Encouraged real engagement: commenting, scrolling back/forth, sharing with friends. People only want to comment when they have negative things to say. when they like a video - they at best give you a like. But when they find smth to complain about, Oh, they go all in. But, if you give your viewers a reason to say smth, a real one, In our case - which accent would you want to learn next? So make it personal.
* Got us some publications to feature the videos.

# Mistakes

* Not scripting every single video. It tanked retention. The two experimental videos - I made a trial 30 min class challenge type of thing. Let the coach and the guest student just do the thing. Well, it doesn't work. It's boring to watch, even though it is more real. I should have scripted and the coach should know the script, but the student can go in blind and follow the lead.
* Cutting shorts *from* long-form videos—looked fine, and I guess might work for some, but didn’t  look good enough for ME and performed accordingly. Taking them down soon and replacing with Tik Toky (low production value quality click bait) shorts I'm shooting and scripting specifically with SHORTs goal in mind in the next few days. So check it out if you are curious, check in again in 1-2 months - we should have the new ones up.

# Growth & Monetization

* Viral jump after the NY video + 2 more strong ones = 8.5K subs in just weeks. New York got us the most subscribers, even with less views, most likely from our old students who knew the company, waiting for these videos, etc. Then 2 more videos - 15K and 23K views, got more subscribers. In that period we were getting 500-1K subs/day.
* Growth slowed to 30–50/day, but stayed steady since.
* No revenue yet. I'm nearing monetization, but **not planning on running ads**—my main goal is brand awareness and supporting our classes, other similar goals.
* I don't think we got any students solely from Youtube, but our conversion rate is going on specifically on Accent Classes, which makes me think people find validation in seeing what the coaches can do, before getting classes. So, not bad, but not worth $20K synced so far. However in the long run, will see what happens.

# Timeline

* **Scripted**: October 2024
* **Filmed**: November 2024
* **Edited**: December 2024
* **First post**: January 2025
* **Current subs**: 10,000+
* **Total cost**: \~$20K
* **Monetization**: Not live, no active plans.
* Expanding to IG and TT soon.
* Also, starting a personal brand channel - completely different approach, plan, everything, except, I remain a perfectionist. Will let you know how that goes if anyone is interested.

Colorful banners hung from the town’s building as they sway gentle in the warm spring breeze. Many reporters and journalists were there to capture every detail in the event. Music filled the air to heighten the wonderful event, as the former Mayor of the town had plans to retire after years of leading the town. A wooden stage had been set up for speeches like a pedestal for potential candidates who would lead the town with dignity.

One of these fools is a big shot politician named Richard who made quite a name for himself in the political world by building a good reputation by improving unemployment and economics, by closing loopholes for large corporations and the ultra-wealthy, making taxes fairer. He dressed in a clean, expressive pressed grey suit, with slick hair, mirrored black shoes, and a charming face that told lies behind his black eyes. Little did anyone know that behind these good deeds stood a crook who made deals with wealthy and powerful CEOs to destroy small businesses and make way for their larger corporations.

The other fool is a clown, a literal clown, named Silly Willy, who dressed in a one-piece oversize outfit that could fit a circus, a white painted face as gentle as snow, blue curly hair, a plush red nose, red lips, oversized yellow shoes that looked like bananas, and dazzling blue eyes that gleamed with happiness. He was there in the center of the town to entertain the people for the upcoming elections and provide joy and laughter to make the event a pleasurable experience, but behind that happy face was a former business owner whose small bakery was demolished after large and powerful CEOs brought his bakery and other small businesses to grow their own company in the area. Making the bakery owner find another alternative to financial support himself by being a performer.

Silly Willy and Richard took the stage, contrasting in appearance and demeanor. Richard smiled and shook hands, trying to win over the crowd with charm, while The Clown started to entertain the people with juggling and magic tricks that delighted the people, making them cheer and laugh as he told silly jokes and danced in a merry way that got the town’s people to root for him more than they did with Richard. The people who were around Richard suddenly started to leave and move onward to The Clown who continued performing his tricks making more people gather around him ignoring the Politician who just stood there in shock.

Richard grew angry as more townspeople left him for Silly Willy, cheering at the clown’s tricks. He was supposed to win their votes, but now he stood ignored, looking like a fool. As the crowd’s laughter grew, Richard couldn’t take it anymore, he stormed toward the clown and shouted.

“Well just look at this fool! He is the biggest clown that I’ve ever seen!”

The crowd that was once cheered suddenly went silent and turned over to the Politician who stood there pointing at the Clown, with anger in his eyes. Silly Willy immediately stopped what he was doing and slowly turned around. to see the Politician standing across from him laughing in a mocking way to degrade him. Silly Willy just shook his head and smiled.

“I may be a clown but I’m no fool,” said Silly Willy “The only fool I see is you!”

“Ohh?” said The Politician “How’s that? I don’t dress like a clown!”

“Of course you do!” Said the Clown “Your wear it every day, thinking that nobody would notice.”

Silly Willy shrugs and the town’s people suddenly begins to laugh at the funny remark, but Richard only grows more irritated as he watches the Clown dance away in glee.

“Only a fool, would make an ass of themselves in front of people they way you do” said Richard sounding confident hoping to gain back the people who left him.

“Then it’s a good thing I’m not a Politician,” said Silly Willy as he stopped in his tracks and smirked at Richard “The last thing I want to be is an ass in front of people,”

The crowd roared with laughter making Richard grow angrier by the second, this clown was making a mockery of him. Seeing the crowd laugh at him was the last thing he needed if he ever wanted to become Mayor of this town. He needed to convince the town’s people that this fool was a nuisance to society and needed to know his place in the world. Richard gathers himself together not wanting the people of Kingsville to see him fold under a stupid clown that had no comparison to him. He took a deep breath and smiled at his opponent.

“And what have you ever done for the community, Clown!?” said Richard “I have made in excellence in society by providing leadership, responsibility, and wisdom. All you seem to do is dance for coins on the street like some monkey, never knowing what it’s like to work a day in life. I know what it means to achieve your goals by working hard and gaining respect from others, I carry burdens you could never understand in your carefree life!”

The crowd suddenly goes quiet. The two opponents stared at each other in silence only the sound of banners hanging from a nearby building flapped against the wind as a warm breeze flowed in.

“Do you?” said Silly Willy finally breaking the silence like glass “I see fools like you making promises to help those in need but have yet to lend out a single coin to those who are begging for food, let alone give them bread to eat.”

A murmur rippled through the crowd as people began to whisper, Richard’s was in shock as he scanned through the crowd and noticed that he was losing this argument that suddenly felt like a debate on who would lead this town in greater leadership. He had to win this argument and the crowd if he ever wanted to be Mayor of this town. The Politician clears his throat and begins to speak.

“You speak of burdens as if you understand them, but tell me Clown, what have you ever done for the people? Made them laugh? Distracted them from their problems for a fleeting moment? While you dance in the streets, I crafted policies that shape the future!

Silly Willy walked closer to Richard never keeping his gaze off him as the sound of his oversize shoes loudly tapped on the ground below him.

 “Policies, you say? The ones that people like you promise over and over again, but never seem to deliver.  Sounds like a magic trick to me, ‘Now you see them now you don’t!”

The crowd whispers again. A few nods of agreement. A few skeptical glances at Richard. The Politician could feel control slipping through his fingers, and his jaw begin to clench as rage kept pouring into him.

“Enough of this!” he snapped, pointing a firm finger at the clown. “You’re nothing but an entertainer. You do not understand the complexities of running a town. You do not understand politics!”

“I understand plenty, sir,” Silly Willy said quietly. “I understand what it means to have everything taken from you.” He sighed dramatically, “I was once a small business owner by the name of William Butters, the proprietor of Butter’s Bakery, a few towns over”

The crowd went completely silent, no one spoke a word instead they stood there and stared as the former Baker continued to speak.

 “I would make fresh bread, cinnamon buns, cookies, cake, and the finest cup of coffee that didn’t taste like tar. Then came the ‘development deal signed off by someone who looks awfully a lot like you. In the newspaper I read you promised new jobs, new stores, progress. What we got was empty storefronts and a chain café that closed in six months.”

No one spoke the heaviness of silence filled the air, the crowd looked towards Richard who was beginning to sweat as Silly Willy continued his speech to the people of Kingsville.

“My bakery was bought, sold, and demolished by big corporations, who saw small businesses as pest that needed to be extinguished to make way for their larger companies! I thought maybe they’ll yeast give me some dough for my bread but no, I all got was crumbs!”

“That plan created many jobs!” snapped The Politician, defending his argument.

“And destroyed multiple business in the process,” yelled Silly Willy “You count what you build. I remember what you broke.”

Richard stepped forward, his voice rising now defensive, walking over to the Clown who only stood in defiance against the crooked Politician.

“I’ve made sacrifices. I’ve taken hard decisions. While you were out here dancing on sidewalks, I was negotiating with CEOs and city planners. That’s real work. Not… balloon animals!”

Silly Willy pulled a long red balloon from his pocket and slowly inflated it while staring straight at Richard.

“You ever notice,” he said calmly, twisting it, “how politicians are like balloon animals? They're loud. Hollow. Full of hot air. And with just a little pressure…”

***POP!!***

The balloon exploded in his hands; the crowd gasped, then roared with laughter. Richard flushed in anger his voice dropped to a growl.

“You’re a clown. You don’t understand the weight of public office.”

“I understand grief. I understand losing my home, my business, and my pride while people like you called it ‘progress.’”

He turned back to the crowd standing with confidence and vigor. He gleamed in front of the crowd without a trace of fright.

“They call me a clown because I smile, I make people laugh and give joy to those who have none. I chose to live this lifestyle not out of misery but out of pure happiness, it was better than living a life a pity and grief.”

The Clown turn towards The Politician never letting down his guard and spoke towards him.

 “But I’m not the one making fools out of hard-working people while shaking hands behind closed doors. When I had my bakery, I donated some of my bread to those without any, You and the CEOs took the cake and ate it!”

The Politician remained silent, there were no words he could say to defend himself. The crowd begin to whisper and started shouting at the cooked man in the center of the ring. Richard tried to convince the people that his decision was an act that was based on what was good for the community but his words fell silence upon the angry crowd who began to surround him.

Many reporters and journalists quickly raced towards The Politician and started hammering questions that Richard was unable to answer. Silly Willy only stood behind the raging crowd as they began to walk towards him shouting at the lying candidate to leave their town. Unable to handle the situation any longer, Richard ran away, leaving the town with its people.

Silly Willy stood calmly as a smile crossed his face, and he looked towards the sky. Kingsville didn’t just pick its next mayor. It remembered what mattered. Not every fool wears a painted face, some wear a suit. The circus left town that day, but the truth stayed behind. Not every clown has a painted face, some wear a suit.",0,1746583015.0,writers,1,0.5,False

I was accused of SA and ik it's easy for me to say with only me being able to tell my side of the story but I genuinely whole heartedly didn't do it and after much trials and tribulations this was thankfully proven.

But in the time between the initial accusation and my last interview with the cops I realised I may have repressed more childhood trauma than I realised.

So for context I was dating this girl will call her...Claire and her and I were close friends and we worked together in a hospital it was intense and we were both young and in a tough environment and bonded as such over the shared experiences.

I considered her my best friend and we really were.

But anyway I'd been working there for about 1 year when suddenly my mental health started declining after I started suffering with paranoid delusions and dissociative episodes lasting hours and progressed into days and it was in that time of November last year that we started dating.

I really don't understand how we got there but she seemed so happy I couldn't break her heart so I stayed with her. But during this relationship she was extremely sexually driven and I was very much...not sex for some reason has always caused me to feel a sense of ""panic"" and anxiety and the first night we spent together was well im not gonna sit here and say she assaulted me because I don't see it that way but she definitely applied some strong amount of pressure when I was clearly in no state to be doing that.

After this it was almost every night we had sex and sure it was nice but not really what I wanted to be doing.

Eventually she started distancing herself from me and I felt like I was losing her for some reason and I couldn't explain why even her family started ignoring me and trying to avoid speaking to me.

This made my paranoia 1000x worse than it already was.

Anyway after a few weeks of this i started drinking pretty heavily to i guess ""cope"" which isn't healthy i know but I just couldn't reach out for help my family were who I needed but was not in good terms with thanks to her families influence.

This night we talked and I felt like we'd finally got back to our close relationship and I felt for a moment some peace she handed me a cup of coffee and I drank it and started making my way to bed unfortunately about halfway through I guess the can of beer I had hit me harder than I expected cuz I suddenly got all dizzy and out of it and she had to help me upstairs.

Last thing I remember is kissing her goodnight and expressing a simple I love you to which she didn't respond.

Anyway the next morning she says we should break up and I didn't understand why then comes the accusations infront of her family I immediately take a step back and try and reason with her and I'm trying not to cry cuz well to be blunt I didn't want to seem as though I was guilt tripping anyone I just wanted to understand why she was doing this.

And after she finishes I had nothing to say because well...what could I say? Her family had already made their minds up and there's really nothing I could do expect plead with them and say I really don't know what she's talking about.

Anyway days go bye and I get arrested for it and then the police tell me what she has said I've done in a great amount of awful detail and after listening all the emotion and grief suddenly turns into blood boiling anger.

The details of the sexual assault were the exact same as what happened to my sister a story I told her just weeks prior after breaking down crying because I had only just found out and felt terrible that my sister didn't tell me.

But after all that it all goes back to normal and I'd say I'm fine but there was a me before this and there's me now who just really isn't the same guy and this has shown my family have kind of stopped trying altogether to bring back the roman they once knew because they know I'm just not that guy anymore nor will I ever be.

And I've realised I have alot of memories repressed that have come back because of this situation and one that I can't quite get a grip on is why I'm so scared of any sexual contact?

And I tried asking my grandmother if anything happened to me as a kid and she was insistant that I didn't need to know anything from back then.

The more I think about it the more I feel sad and scared all at the same time

So sorry I know that seemed hella longwinded but I want yall to know my full story and that yes I am telling the truth that's something I do alot more now than ever and my advice to anyone who finds themselves in my situation...the truth is your greatest ally even if some parts make you look questionable it's better to be honest always.

Anyway if someone could help me understand what the hell is wrong with me I'd appreciate it

Also ik I'm a bad story teller but I'm doing my best lemme know if yall want more details I can try my best if it paints a better picture for yall to help me.

There are a few value premo targets again this week, however there remains a dearth of good rookie downgrade options.
Gawn has returned to the heights of yesteryear and is now not a feasible trade in for most - alongside Bont and Butters - however two Uber Premos in Brayshaw and N.Daicos may be slightly more affordable over the coming weeks thanks to low scores in round 8.



*Defenders*


**Zorko - 501K**, saved by some junk-time kick-to-kick scoring late in last weeks game, his BE sits at 95 prior to matches against North and Melbourne over the coming two weeks. If he scores as expected (which, to be fair, he hasn't done for half the season to date), we could see his price rise to the 550K - 570K range ahead of his R16 bye. There are probably better options for value and scoring this week in other lines, but Zorko is a perfect choice if you're strapped for cash.


**Sinclair - 533K**, a bargain for someone who should easily be a top 6 defender at season's end. With a BE of 131 there's a chance he drops another ~10K with a poor score this week, and he won't be out of reach even if he goes 150+. With Carlton, WCE, and Melbourne across the next four weeks, he's looking like a must-include, however we have the luxury of waiting until next week if you would like more confidence in a return to his elite scoring potential.


**Sheezel - 567K**, not cheap compared to some of the other options, but is thriving in his return to the backline. Has Richmond and WCE in the next four games, but unfortunately has the infamous R12 bye. His current price is the lowest I would expect to see it for the rest of the year if he keeps this role, so the dilemma becomes whether to get him now at his cheapest and absorb the lack of scoring in the first bye, or get him after the bye for around 600K. If, like most people, your team is full of players with the R12 bye, you should probably wait and pay the inflated cost in R13.


*Speculative Defence Picks*

The Daicos Difference


**J.Daicos - 489K**, has a found a nice run of form across the previous 3 weeks and achieved a 3 round average of 112. Collingwood has an exceptional run home so if he maintains his form he could sneak his way into the D5-8 range. Currently only in 3% of teams, this could be a huge POD but carries an equally high risk of failure.


*Midfielders*


**Dunkley - 521K**, an outrageous price for a bona fide top 8 midfielder and scored 109 last week despite being deployed as a tagger against Rowell. Dunks has a BE of 97 with North and Melbourne upcoming, and he has averaged 130 across the past four games played against these clubs. Returned to a primarily midfield role last week following the previous stint on the wing, and would be my pick for best value selection for this weeks trades.


**Dawson - 521K**, the last two weeks he has demonstrated his high ceiling and low floor. This appears largely contingent on disposal efficiency - both field kicking and conversion in front of goal - which has been well below his historical 70% average across the beginning of the year, but turned around last week. His 498K price last week was probably the lowest we will see it this year, and he is still a good value inclusion with his BE of 74 ahead of the Showdown this week and WCE in round 11.


**Rozee - 527K**, remains great value in his new half back role, and the poor score of 78 last week is less indicative of poor individual performance than a team who soiled the proverbial bed. Given he may receive DPP status as a defender he would be a hand picky for scoring potential at this price and could be a valuable structural piece allowing flexibility later in the season. He shouldn't drop too much lower over the coming weeks with a current BE of 114, so now is as good a time as any to grab him.


**Serong - 553K**, despite a game plan that seemingly favours Serong predominantly handballing from first possession and applying tackles, the Fremantle staple is still seemingly scoring within historical patterns; a review of his scoring trends across the last two years suggests that his 110-115 average was achieved mostly through sustained scoring in the 85 - 110 range and elevated with the occasional ceiling score of 140+. With a BE of 137 he may drop another 10K or so, but his current price seems like excellent value for a player who should sit at M4 - M10 by the end of the year. Would be a good pickup this week or next, and a potential minor POD play given his 26% ownership and some current owners looking to move him along.


*Speculative Midfield Picks*

Two cheaper players we don't really think will contend for keeper status, but may surprise us.


**W.Ashcroft - 490K**, highly variable scoring with a premium ceiling and a rookie floor, but will probably be a midfield stalwart for years to come. Good match ups with North and Melbourne for the next two weeks, a BE of 59, and should be priced between 530K and 555K in two weeks time. A good POD play at 19% ownership.


**Callaghan - 498K**, has had a run of great form with a 3 round average of 121 against respectable opponents. With a BE of 43 he should make at least another 40K over the next two weeks, so it would be a fantastic time to jump in now if you want to take the gamble that he sustains his newfound form.


*Rucks*


**Gawn (687K)** went crazy last week and will probably sit mid 700K for the coming rounds, demonstrating once again why we should all pick the supercoach ruck GOAT to start the year. **Xerri (629K)** is still reachable at a stretch, and this will also likely be his lowest price for the coming weeks, especially considering the WCE matchup in R13. The advice remains the same, you should have at least one of Gawn or Xerri in your team, and with Gawn currently at an absurd cost, this week might be the last time we access to one of the pair for a long time, and due consideration should be made to trading in Xerri. Some may find themselves in a position to achieve this via upgrading Flynn (384K) who has made 123K for us so far, has shaky job security, and will need to survive in the team for a few weeks before he restarts any significant cash generation. 


**Marshall - 471K**, provides the only real value trade in option for those needing a ruck but unable to pay up for Gawn or Xerri. With a BE of 31 and favourable match ups against Carlton and WCE in the next two weeks, he's a realistic chance to go up by 70K in two weeks.


*Forwards*

Assuming most competitive teams contain Macrae and Smith, we can look see two groups emerge for FWD targets this week - reliable picks at about 520K, and speculative picks priced below this.


**Petracca - 523K**, scored nearly 130 as hoped against two basement teams in Richmond and WCE the previous two weeks, now we just need to hope he can maintain the scoring against competitive sides. Beautiful heatmaps with a predominantly midfield role and respectable CBAs suggest he should be able to continue to score. Has possible tags coming from Jordon (assuming he doesn't continue his recent trend of tagging a defender) and Windhager, and although he scored respectably against Sydney and Saints last time they met, he wasn't tagged in either of these games.


**Rankine - 529K**, in a good run of form at the moment with a BE of 48, would be an excellent inclusion this week as he approaches what should be his ""appropriate price"" of ~560K for an anticipated 110 average. Has more a more established CBA role with Crouch out injured, so can hopefully sustain his over the coming weeks.


*Speculative Forward Picks*

Thinking on it now there's only really the one, given that Dylan Moore's (399K) price will continue to tank over the coming weeks.


**Warner - 488K**, the reason most people didn't pick him up at the bargain price of 461K last week was that there is substantial evidence of cyclical runs of good and bad scoring across the previous years - predicated largely on form and position - that ultimately ends in a passable average score of 100. This is what differentiates this pick, that is a known pattern of highly variable but ultimately mediocre scoring, from other PODs like J.Daicos and W.Ashcroft that have an unknown element and may ultimately pay off. Despite a run of two 120+ scores this fundamental issue with the selection hasn't changed, and we can expect him to continue well for a few weeks to maybe reach high 500K range and then tank again. If you're selecting him this week it should either be a) as a cash play for potentially ~80 - 110K before moving him on to someone reliable, or b) because you genuinely believe that this cycle is different from every other high-low cycle he's done before, and with Mills possibly back to displace Warner from CBAs over the coming weeks, you would have to have some other basis than his recent high CBA percentage to justify this belief. A highly speculative pick and one that many people have been burned by before. Could possibly be a good flex / F7, however, in a complete team that you could loop in for his ceiling scores, but may not be the perfect round 9 inclusion while there are still rookies to get off field.


*Rookie Options*


**Hustwaite - 121K**, the only solid rookie downgrade option this week has a BE of -83 and should be safe for another 1-2 weeks at least with his solid recent performances and Nash out with suspension. Potentially fieldable as well if required.


As 14213 coaches last week found with **Busslinger** (**119K**, score of 4 last week), going early on a rookie carries risk. With that in mind we can see two early options in **Fonti (DEF, 160K)** and **Boxshall (MID, 113K)**, with Fonti probably having the edge due to better job security and lower sub risk, although he carries a higher pricetag. **Lorenz (MID, 119K)** may at any stage be a like for like swap out with Moraes, and **Maley (FWD/RUC, 119K)** is one to watch for another week to see if he can perform well at an AFL level. With McGovern out, **Brock (DEF, 99K)** could be an interesting pick if he's selected, although we'd assume he goes straight back out once McGovern returns. **Hardeman (DEF, 190K)** could be a good inclusion at a higher price if you think he can avoid the sub vest.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Many people reach for a cup of coffee to jumpstart their day. While coffee has its benefits, functional beverages have been growing in popularity as a smarter alternative. These specially crafted drinks offer more than just caffeine; they bring in added health perks and tailored ingredients to support your body and mind throughout the day. If you’re curious about why switching from regular coffee to functional beverages might be a game changer, here are seven compelling reasons that make these drinks worth exploring.

### Boosts Health with Added Nutrients

Unlike regular coffee, functional beverages are often packed with vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that promote overall wellness. Ingredients like adaptogens, antioxidants, and herbal extracts enhance your immune system, reduce inflammation, and combat oxidative stress. This means when you sip on a functional drink, you’re not just energizing—you’re also fueling your body with ingredients designed to support long-term health.

### Provides Enhanced Mental Clarity and Focus

Coffee is primarily known for its caffeine content which boosts alertness. However, functional beverages often combine caffeine with nootropics and natural brain enhancers like ginseng, L-theanine, or rhodiola rosea. These components help improve concentration, reduce jitteriness, and promote a calm yet focused state of mind. You get the mental uplift without the common side effects of coffee such as anxiety or sudden crashes.

### Reduces Dependence on High Caffeine Intake

Many functional beverages contain moderate or balanced amounts of caffeine combined with other natural compounds that help sustain energy levels. This can reduce your overall caffeine dependence and prevent the negative impacts of excessive coffee consumption, like insomnia or digestive discomfort. It’s a gentler way to stay energized throughout the day without constantly reaching for multiple cups of coffee.

### Supports Digestive Health

Coffee can sometimes cause stomach upset or acid reflux, especially when consumed on an empty stomach. Functional beverages, on the other hand, may include probiotics, prebiotics, or soothing botanicals such as ginger and turmeric. These ingredients assist in maintaining a healthy gut environment and help reduce inflammation or discomfort related to digestive issues. Switching to functional drinks can make your daily routine easier on your stomach.

### Offers Hydration Benefits

Functional beverages often are formulated to promote better hydration. Unlike coffee, which has a mild diuretic effect, many of these drinks include electrolytes and natural hydrating agents that support fluid balance in your body. Proper hydration is essential for energy, cognitive function, and overall health. Choosing functional beverages can help you stay better hydrated throughout your day.

### Provides a Variety of Flavor Profiles

If you’re tired of the same bitter taste of regular coffee, functional beverages offer a wide range of unique and delicious options. From matcha and herbal blends to sparkling hydrating drinks infused with botanical extracts, there is a flavor for every palate. This variety makes it easier and more enjoyable to break away from your usual coffee habit and discover new favorites that also support your health goals.

### Supports Specific Wellness Goals

One of the most exciting benefits of functional beverages is their ability to target specific health needs. Whether your goal is stress reduction, immune support, detoxification, or improved sleep, there is likely a functional drink tailored to help. These beverages combine science-backed ingredients that work synergistically to give you results beyond the typical caffeine boost you get from coffee.

Exploring functional beverages as an alternative to regular coffee can offer you a broader spectrum of benefits. From enhanced mental clarity and improved digestion to personalized wellness support, these drinks provide more than just a quick energy fix. By integrating functional beverages into your daily routine, you not only care for your energy levels but also nourish and protect your body in ways regular coffee cannot. Give them a try—you might find that your new favorite drink is also your best choice for long-term health.

</div>How Functional Beverages Enhance Health and Energy Compared to Traditional Coffee Choices
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Unlocking the Benefits of Functional Beverages Over Regular Coffee

 For many, reaching for a cup of coffee in the morning is a daily ritual. It provides a familiar source of energy and comfort. However, there’s been a rising interest in functional beverages, a category of drinks that do more than just quench thirst or give a caffeine boost. These beverages aim to improve your overall health and energy levels in ways regular coffee simply can’t match. Understanding how functional beverages enhance both well-being and vitality can inspire you to consider making a healthy switch.

### What Makes Functional Beverages Different?

 Unlike traditional coffee, which mostly offers caffeine, functional beverages contain ingredients designed to target various aspects of health. These could include vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, adaptogens, probiotics, and natural energy boosters. Each ingredient serves a purpose, allowing you not only to increase alertness but also to support digestion, immunity, mental clarity, and even mood stabilization.

### Seven Reasons to Choose Functional Beverages Over Coffee

1. **Balanced Energy Without the Crash.** While coffee provides a quick caffeine spike, it often leads to a sudden energy crash later. Functional beverages usually combine caffeine with other natural components that support sustained energy release. For example, green tea extracts or ginseng can offer smooth alertness, helping prevent jitters and fatigue.
2. **Enhanced Nutritional Support.** Unlike black coffee, functional beverages often come loaded with essential nutrients. These drinks might include B vitamins to boost metabolism, antioxidants like vitamin C and E for fighting free radicals, and minerals like magnesium that aid muscle function. This means you’re not just hydrating but nourishing your body.
3. **Improved Gut Health.** Many regular coffee drinkers can experience stomach discomfort or acid reflux after consuming their morning cup. Functional beverages frequently contain probiotics or prebiotics, which help improve gut flora and digestion. This can reduce bloating, improve nutrient absorption, and promote overall digestive wellness.
4. **Adaptogens to Combat Stress.** Stress is common in today’s fast-paced world, but regular coffee does little to ease it and might even heighten anxiety due to high caffeine levels. Functional beverages incorporate adaptogens such as ashwagandha or rhodiola, which help regulate the body’s stress response. This can make you feel calmer and more focused throughout your day.
5. **Hydration Benefits.** Coffee is a mild diuretic; it can cause dehydration if consumed excessively. Functional beverages, particularly those designed with electrolytes and natural hydrating ingredients, keep you well-hydrated while still delivering an energy boost. Staying hydrated is key for maintaining energy, preventing headaches, and supporting skin health.
6. **Reduced Risk of Side Effects.** Some people experience side effects from coffee, such as increased heart rate, anxiety, or sleep disruption. Functional beverages tend to offer lower caffeine content or use natural caffeine alternatives, which reduces these risks. Additionally, their thoughtful ingredient blends aim to minimize any negative impacts on your nervous system.
7. **Supports Immune Function.** Many functional beverages feature ingredients known to strengthen the immune system, like elderberry, echinacea, or turmeric. Regular coffee does not deliver these benefits. This immunity boost helps your body better defend against illnesses, which is especially valuable during cold and flu seasons or periods of high stress.
 
### Navigating Your Options for Functional Beverages

 If you’re curious about trying functional beverages, you’ll find plenty of varieties on the market. These range from herbal infused waters and energy tonics to kombucha and protein-enriched shakes. When selecting a product, it’s wise to look for natural ingredients, transparent labeling, and added benefits tailored to your health goals.

 It’s worth noting that functional beverages can complement your lifestyle, but they are not a cure-all or a replacement for a balanced diet. Combining them with proper hydration, nutritious food, and mindful habits will amplify their positive effects on your health and energy.

### Making the Switch Easy and Enjoyable

 Transitioning from your daily coffee habit to functional beverages doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. Start with one or two types that excite you — perhaps a calming mushroom coffee with reishi or a sparkling electrolyte drink. Experiment with flavors and ingredients to discover what makes you feel vibrant and energized throughout your day.

 Remember, the key advantage of functional beverages lies in their holistic approach: they energize you while actively supporting your body’s natural processes. By incorporating these drinks into your routine, you’re choosing more than just a caffeine fix — you’re investing in your long-term wellness and vitality.

</div>### Conclusion

Choosing functional beverages over regular coffee can be a game-changer for your daily routine. These innovative drinks offer more than just a caffeine boost—they deliver added health benefits that traditional coffee often lacks. From improved hydration to enhanced mental focus, functional beverages are designed to support your body and mind in ways that regular coffee simply can’t match.

You’ve learned how these drinks can provide steady energy without the crash, thanks to their unique ingredients like adaptogens, herbs, and vitamins. Plus, they often come with added antioxidants and immune-supporting nutrients, helping you stay healthier throughout the day. Unlike regular coffee, which may sometimes cause jitters or digestive discomfort, many functional beverages offer a gentler lift that’s easier on your system.

Switching to functional beverages can also introduce variety to your choices, making your daily habits more enjoyable and purposeful. Whether you want to boost your productivity, improve your mood, or enhance your overall wellness, these drinks provide targeted support crafted to meet those needs.

By embracing functional beverages, you’re not just making a simple swap—you're investing in a smarter, healthier way to energize your day. Give them a try, and notice how they can fit seamlessly into your lifestyle, turning your beverage choice into a wellness boost. Making this change could be the fresh start your routine has been waiting for.",1,1746582887.0,Adaptogen101,0,1.0,False

Just enough to make life worth living and enjoy which is what I seek most. Some things about me:

	◦	6 feet tall, hazel eyes, brown hair, shaved face, and I wear shorts almost all year round, unless I am at work.

	◦	Enjoying the outdoors is very much a priority for me
	◦	I love collecting movies and watching them on my fancy, expensive TV (not to brag or anything)
	◦	Riding my bicycle and traveling are enjoyable to me plus I got bike rack for my car for two bicycles
	◦	Cooking is something I want to get better at and all ready have a good assortment of tools for the job in my kitchen and would like to acquire more

I (late 20s M) recently cut ties with a friend — I’ll call him George — and I’m starting to question whether I handled it the right way, or if I’m being too sensitive.

George and I met through my university’s library and got along quickly. I eventually opened up to him about some really personal stuff — childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. At the time, I felt I could trust him.

Things shifted when he brought me to his church group. I liked it at first, but then he and his brother started pushing political conversations — mostly pro-Trump stuff — even after I told them I wasn’t comfortable discussing politics. George kept pressing me, asking if my views were just “inherited from my dad,” and wouldn’t drop it even when I said I didn’t want to talk about it.

I told him his behavior was making me uncomfortable and that I wanted an apology. Instead of addressing it, he refused to apologize over text and told me the friendship was basically over unless we met in person. I still agreed to meet and even bought him a coffee, hoping to smooth things over. Instead of apologizing, he told me I had low self-esteem, that I was dragging him down to my level, and that I was “sounding like the devil.” He also tried to pray over me, which I declined. I left feeling belittled and humiliated, so I walked away and ended the friendship.

Since then, I’ve distanced myself from the church group and anyone connected to him. But here’s where it gets more uncomfortable: I saw him at the library yesterday. When I got up from my seat, I noticed he was sitting two rows ahead of me, with his back to me. Later, after I came back from getting a drink of water, I saw that he’d moved a couple rows forward — this time directly facing me. It felt really unsettling.

His brother also randomly removed me on Social Media, and George has been acting like nothing happened — giving me fist bumps and being overly friendly in public. A couple of his friends have reached out, but I haven’t said much — just that I’ve been busy.

Now I’m anxious that he might be sharing the personal things I confided in him, especially the mental health stuff, and trying to make me look unstable or dramatic. I feel like I’ve lost control of the narrative, and it’s really messing with my head.

It wasn’t my first encounter with the Army’s infamous Bermuda Triangle…S1’s packet submission process. But for some reason, I still trusted the system. I handed that thing over to my command thinking it’d make it where it needed to go.

Well it vanished…
1SG told me, “S1 says it’s at Brigade.”
That exact status held for two months.
Then Brigade finally hit back with:

“Never heard of her.”

At that point, I said screw it and skipped battalion entirely. I brought my REFRAD packet straight to Brigade S1 to keep it from going MIA again.

Fast forward to CSP time. I’m older, wiser, and one lost packet more jaded. I remembered what the NCOs taught me: “No one cares about your career more than you do.”

This time, I wasn’t taking chances. I taped an AirTag inside the manila folder. If it ended up under a COF coffee machine again, I was gonna know exactly where it died. 

The packet makes its rounds. Legal touches it. Brigade blesses it. Battalion receives it. And then it hits my XO’s desk…and the AirTag hits the fan.

He calls me in, looking like I just planted a foreign device on the division commander.

“You can’t put a tracking device on official documents. That shows you don’t trust the system.”

Exactly.

“If you wanted to know where it was, you could’ve asked your leadership.”

Then he hits me with:

“What if that packet went through a classified area? You’d have put an AirTag in a secure zone.”

Sir, my CSP packet wasn’t exactly a Top Secret mission plan. It wasn’t going to Delta Force HQ. It was going to Legal, where the most action it saw was a bored paralegal eating takis over it.

So yeah…lesson learned. Next time, I’ll just trust the process, ignore reality, and act surprised when my packet vanishes into the void again.

Anyway, moral of the story: trust the process. Or don’t. Either way, your packet’s probably still sitting in someone’s inbox under three Monster cans and a GPC purchase request from 2019.

Most weeks, I am already at work at this time and so it’s a non-issue. Every once in a while I will take PTO for a long weekend and be home that day. We’re talking every 6-8 months at the /very/ most. My boyfriend wants me to wake up before 8am and leave the house for an hour so that he can have his appointment in the living room like he normally does. I asked my boyfriend if he could take the appointment from his car so that I don’t have to get up early and find something to do. We live in a very small town and the only real options for me would be to go sit in a coffee shop for an hour or go for a walk. My boyfriend thinks that me pushing back on this is very disrespectful of his therapy and his schedule. My feeling is that this is my home too, and it’s unreasonable to not just sit in his car for an hour. My boyfriend stated that if I asked him to leave, he would do it out of respect for my standing appointment. I told him that I would never ask him to leave his own home out of respect for his time and space. 

We’ve had a couple conversations about this and I have agreed to find something else to do for an hour in the morning on the off times it happens, but who is correct here? ",3,1746580982.0,AITAH,55,0.58,False

At first it was just horrible. My throar was sore, I was burping all the time, I was very very bloated and had heartburn as well most of the time. I managed this with PPI that wasn't helpful at all. Then very strict diet and gaviscon. It slowly got better and managable but never the same as it was before my massive flare. 

Fast forward to this month. I was able to eat still restricted but somewhat more normal diet on a trip abroad. My symptoms got much better there even though I had cheat days and even had a bit of coffee one time. Just a bit. With oat milk. Didn't feel worse after but took some gaviscon just in case. 

Now back in the US and throat hurts sooo much. I have post nasal drip but no fever and no heartburn. How do I know if this is from LPR or if I caught a cold? 

I know some of us have LPR without heartburn and I'm one of those ppl but my throat has never hurt this bad and I'd think that at this level of pain I'd have heartburn as well.

Since I posted three days ago, I’ve made great progress, thanks to [u/DBacon1052](https://www.reddit.com/user/DBacon1052/) and this amazing community! The new workflow is producing excellent skies and foregrounds. That said, there is still room for improvement. I certainly appreciate the help!

# Current Issues

The workflow and models handle foreground objects (bright and clear elements) very well. However, they struggle with blurry backgrounds. The system often renders dark backgrounds as straight black or turns them into distinct objects instead of preserving subtle, blurry details.

Because I paste the original image over the generated one to maintain detail, this can sometimes cause obvious borders, making a frame effect. Or it creates overly complicated renders where simplicity would look better.

# What Didn’t Work

* The following three all are some form of piecemeal generation. producing part of the border at a time doesn't produce great results since the generator either wants to put too much or too little detail in certain areas.
* **Crop and stitch (4 sides):** Generating narrow slices produces awkward results. Adding context mask requires more computing power undermining the point of the node.
* **Generating 8 surrounding images (4 sides + 4 corners):** Each image doesn't know what the other images look like, leading to some awkward generation. Also, it's slow because it assembling a full 9-megapixel image.
* **Tiled KSampler:** same problems as the above 2. Also, doesn't interact with other nodes well.
* **IPAdapter:** Distributes context uniformly, which leads to poor content placement (for example, people appearing in the sky).

# What Did Work

* Generating a smaller border so the new content better matches the surrounding content.
* Generating the entire border at once so the model understands the full context.
* Using the right model, one geared towards realism (here, epiCRealism XL vxvi LastFAME (Realism)).

If the someone could help me nail an end result, I'd be really grateful!

She claims it's all ""planned out."" We've heard that before.

It usually ends with someone getting muted, someone

getting scammed, and Joe whispering ""we'll fix it later"" off

* A new ""deep dive topic"" each day (translation: vibes and vague generalities)
* Three rounds of ""featured sellers"" (aka free labor for her empire of chaos)
* A Q&A segment where questions will either be ignored, deflected, or weaponized
* 15 minutes of closet reviews - because nothing says business advice like someone whose own sales are suspiciously MIA



She even had a full-blown moment during the

announcement when no one was commenting and said

""maybe no one's excited"" - girl, if that isn't the subtitle of

this whole show.

- I watch a decent amount of movies but have missed a lot of big ones and am fairly active on Letterboxd (my ""top 4"" are Sunshine, A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night, Donnie Darko, and as cliche as it is Before Sunrise).
- I also enjoy live theater and have seen a bunch of plays/musicals in the past few years, mostly local smaller-ish productions (vs. like Broadway).

Also, one other question, why is it standard to take everything out of packages and put them in the paper bags? It's a waste of bags and it makes the food item spoil faster… If you don't want something warmed, I don't see why things don't just stay in packages?

Sometimes I drink them soonish, sometimes it takes me all day. The ambient temp ranges between 68 and 82 any given day. It can have a straw, but it does have to have a lid. I love my metal cups for water, but for coffee, it tastes weird. Thanks!
Edit to add. I'm trying to make more drinks at home, and I've tried some cups, but they didn't seem to work for me. Ideally, I'd like to have only 1 cup for everything. I'm running out of space between my and my kids' cups. ",4,1746580092.0,simpleliving,4,1.0,False
1kgl1ck,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kgl1ck,"Looking for feedback: Book rest, coffee mug & phone holder","Mixed media print and engineered timber.  
Overall feedback for look, printability and next steps. 
Designer for 16 years or more and I’ve 
made a few variants of this and seeking feedback for adding other features without detracting from the simplicity of its design. 

Things to be added:
1) Ability to hold a ‘Universal MagSafe’ style Qi-charger behind the book rest to keep it hidden but able to mag onto a phone and charge it while you recharge with a good book. 
2) Opening from rear of the bottom of the phone holder to allow any USB-C cable to pass through the design (without looking terrible) 
3) Timber plate: will be varnished with UV resistant outdoor grade finish. 
The plate will also be manufactured and then routed into with plunge router (using a 3|D printer template and eventually fully CNC routed) to ensure repeatability and finish of outer edge but also to add a 90mm diameter magnetically held (removable/replaceable) coaster where the rounded part sits. It will be held by a magnet that is recessed within the bottom side of the timber between a thin section of timber and a washer will be printed at a pause in the coaster print. 

Feel free I to offer any feedback or suggest any improvements. I.e. my ex-borders manager wife said it needs to *possibly* be a little pointier at the top so it doesn’t break the spine of the book. 

Lastly… anyone got a price tag in mind for one? They come (almost) flat packed and require 3x M6 bolts to be assembled with a provided 3D printed flat-blade screwdriver. 

P.S.
I’m also thinking of paused print to add an apple magsafe charger within the print and supplying them at cost with the book rest. This will however add complexity to my business, it gets a little confusing and adds legal requirements of providing and supporting warranty if the supplied MagSafe charger in case of failure. 
Thanks in advance everyone for your thoughts and feedback.

Was at a coffee shop getting some work done when I noticed a rancid odor. I turn to my right and see a woman setting up shop to change her baby’s diaper in the MIDDLE OF THE DAMN COFFEE SHOP. The odor was…heinous. 

Used diaper and wipe dispenser placed on top of the table. At least the baby stayed in the fucking scooter carriage thing or whatever it’s called. But also, this all happened *no less than 8 feet away* from a handicap accessible large bathroom that was not occupied or locked by staff. Clearly labeled. 🌟 “BATHROOM” 🌟
