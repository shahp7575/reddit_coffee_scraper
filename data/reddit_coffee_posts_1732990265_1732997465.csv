1h3l4rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSULB/comments/1h3l4rv/my_experience_pledging_akpsi/,my experience pledging akpsi,"the title is as blunt as it can get, however after a comment I made on a recent CSULB Business Clubs post, I surprisingly got 5-7 message requests asking me about my experience so I would rather make a post about it and make it public in case people were curious about what AKPsi is like.

Rush Week: typical. Because I am a business major, getting along with those already in the club and people planning on pledging was very easy. However, despite this org being open to all majors, it was very limited outside of business. From what I recall, a few healthcare majors, a few political science majors, and maybe a few engineering majors. Considering it is fraternity culture, a lot of what goes down within the frat is very hush-hush, however, you can tell a lot of them are forced to like each other. Considering the person doing me over Instagram was very big on emphasizing the “brotherhood of the chapter,” it was honestly embarrassing to see how cliquey it had already felt from the beginning. In my honest opinion, the lack of diversity should have been my biggest red flag. There were maybe 3-4 Hispanics there, three of them did have positions from what I recall, however, it looked like they were excluded from the majority of the organization. I think it's great when I see professional groups start including historically underrepresented minorities. However, when you’re already seeing other minorities being excluded from the get-go, especially during Rush Week, I kinda should’ve known what I was getting myself into. I was even more thrown aback after seeing one of the other Hispanics in the room getting ignored directly by one of the Pledge parents and from what I saw throughout the pledging process, it was very clear that it was intentional and not accidental. I wanted to keep my mind open considering I had friends in different chapters all across Southern California and in the different schools on the East Coast. All of them emphasized the professionalism and the connections you can get out of joining an organization like Alpha Kappa Psi, however, I think this is something that the chapter at CSULB has lacked heavy and could have potentially lacked for a while. 

The Pledging Process: honestly speaking it was another 3 unit class you’re essentially paying to be there for, which was also emphasized at the very beginning of rush week. I do not want to get into details on the actual process in a Reddit thread in case someone from the chapter is crazy enough to pursue legal action for exposing the process as a whole which is why I’m not about to go into specifics, however, I will go into my personal experience within the process and how it was more of a shitshow than something that could benefit me professionally. One of the things we’re supposed to do within the process is email those who are already in the chapter, ask to meet with them for an interview, and ask them questions about their professional life and AKPsi as a whole. If the point is to ask them about professional careers and advice on how to get there, then there is no use considering the majority of the people in there have nothing to get questions for. If you go on their website, 75% of them have N/A listed on the professional experience portion of the website. Which brings me to my main question, if a majority of the organization has been there for over 2+ semesters, meaning more than a year, what the actual fuck do yall do to get a career for yourselves. Don’t get me wrong, the social aspect of the organization is most there, considering some of the members would smoke during my interviews with them. However, why call yourselves a professional organization if there’s absolutely nothing professional to it? I think what’s even more ironic is that a lot of the people were extremely standoffish during the interview as if AKPsi gave them some sort of ego boost, without an actual job to prove themselves, which honestly gave me a big load of secondhand embarrassment. I will say this, our pledge class was an interesting one for sure. Throughout my interviews, I kept hearing that one class had the best brotherhood or whatever the hell business frats call it but I looked at mine and sighed in despair. That shit felt so off, and even more so considering both of our pledge parents constantly drop the n-word like it's rapid fire. What threw me off even more was that our class had no accountability for those who would say it too. Now, I’m no expert but honestly speaking, if you’re 100% Viet, Filipino, Japanese, or Chinese, in no way shape, or form should you be dropping the n-word as if you were black yourself. I honestly felt as if our pledge parents were either intentionally ignorant, racist, or both, but seeing how that word was thrown around honestly did not sit right with me. The cherry on top is that most of the Hispanic pledges got dropped from the chapter after the mid-way evaluation, which made me question if it was intentional or if it just came out of blatant ignorance. If this organization has not received any sort of racial sensitivity training, especially as a student organization, it is very concerning considering the high standards being held for the name of this organization nationwide. I am genuinely concerned as to why the school hasn’t investigated Alpha Kappa Psi further considering multiple protocols have been broken throughout this semester alone and from what I have heard, even from those who are in the chapter, semesters prior.

Lack of professionalism/overall experience with different members: most of my interaction with the members was during our interviews. I met with a majority of the chapter and out of all of them that stood out, only 2 were professional, which did not surprise me since they seemed to be the only ones within the chapter to have professional/workplace experience to the bone. I remember my first interview very well, we’re sitting down drinking coffee, and then all of a sudden, this individual started asking me about my pledge brother and if they’re trans. Immediately taken aback, I told them I did not feel comfortable talking about it since it was none of my business and multiple transphobic comments were made. After this incident, I felt a little discouraged since I’m usually not the type of person to care that much about how another person decides to identify but for a chapter that seems very exclusive on who they allow based on how their vibe coincides with everyone else, I was not shocked that these comments were made. Around my second or third interview, I wanted to see how I felt before deciding to stay or drop the process and this one did it for me. For context, I work a minimum-wage job. Growing up, my family was poor and had to work paycheck to paycheck for various reasons. I decided to ask this individual for advice and instead of getting help, it felt more degrading than ever. I kid you not, asking me questions on what it's like to live on minimum wage, “Oh I could never imagine working for under $37 an hour ever again” but what did it for me was “I genuinely wonder what it’s like to work a minimum wage job, I would love to do it for the fun of it but I would hate to be in your position for most of my life.” I swear I almost threw my drink at the girl that said that. I think another thing that stood out was how the girls in the organization treated the girl pledges in comparison to the guy pledges. It was very obvious that a majority of the girls in the chapter always took out the guys to eat but gave a ton of shit to the girl pledges within our class which was honestly shocking. Whether or not anyone decides to be a girls-girl is up to them, however, when a majority comes off as standoffish and just straight-up rude to other girls in the pledge class whether it's out of intimidation or just plain rudeness is honestly wild to think about. I did not let this affect me as I went about it in a way where I know who I am and genuinely, a business frat won’t change that. Another thing that stood out was the power trippy attitudes coming from those, who again, do not have any professional experience at all. I got a whole essay on professional etiquette from a person who ended up showing the complete opposite and honestly just looked very stupid to me in my opinion. While it was a little lax for the last few weeks, a bonfire incident happened where both members and pledges were caught drinking at a dry event. However, what immediately bothered me about this whole incident was how one guy in the pledge class practically took the heat of it without any further action being taken against those who were actively drinking and smoking within the organization (not including pledges). The pledge got dropped on the very last day which resulted in other pledges dropping out of retaliation and most of them going ghost as a rebuttal. When we found out that there were a certain group of individuals pushing for the pledge to get dropped, it honestly took me by surprise considering these were the same people that had nothing to show for them professionally and honestly made themselves look like a shitshow. This made me realize, how you expect anyone to take you seriously if you can’t hold yourself to the same standard. Throughout my process, I was very disappointed and honestly pissed off at how the whole process went about. Lowkey, it was on me for not doing further research and assuming that this could happen. However, when looking into how other chapters across the country were run and seeing how there have been good employment opportunities through connections from the name Alpha Kappa Psi, I expected so much more than a total shitshow of a pledging process. If you want to surround yourself with this, be my guest, however, considering how fucked up the whole thing was, I doubt the org staying around for another year or so.

1h3l3e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlusSize/comments/1h3l3e4/feeling_dumb/,Feeling Dumb...,"Matched with a guy on WooPlus who got a little defensive when I didn't respond right away... admittedly I don't use WooPlus often because I don't think I find very high-quality people there. We exchange numbers and started texting on Monday. 

He was pretty good at responding, sent a few voice notes, and tried to get himself invited over on Wednesday. I stood my ground and said while I like him, I wanted to meet in public first for a date. 

We had loosely planned for a date yesterday (Friday), but both agreed to reschedule. We had planned for coffee today (Saturday). Originally agreed to 1:30, he asked if we could meet earlier. I said yes, hopped in the shower and started my routine. I told him I would text him when I was ready to head out as it takes about a half hour for me to get to the coffee spot he suggested. Before I was out of the shower, he had texted and asked if we could delay for a little while as he had to go help a coworker in a neighborhood to the west of our area. I said sure and just let me know when he was ready. 

  
So that was at 12:19 PM. It's currently 2 and not only have I not had a message/response since 12:31, I think I may be blocked (we both have iPhones - my message from 1:13 says ""delivered""... the one from 1:54 does not). 

  
I feel dumb for being excited. I feel dumb for putting on make up. I feel dumb for thinking something could have been different this time. 

I feel like it's so hard to find decent partners when you're plus sized. It's also hard to find decent partners when you've ""girlbossed"" hard (I have a masters degree, own my home, have a great job, maintain independence, etc). 

  
Hopefully I'm just feeling pessimistic. Hopefully he'll respond and it will have been worth the make up and ""everything shower"" I took. ",1,1732997228.0,PlusSize,1,1.0,False

I had my bisalp this past Thursday and thought I'd share my experience. I realize that was Thanksgiving for many, but I'm Canadian so it was just another day, although a great one. Overall, everything went really well! Forgive the long post, but I'm a writer and I'm not great at brevity.

I got to the hospital at 8:30am. First thing they made me do was take a urine sample and I had that terrible feeling of, ""oh no, this is probably a pregnancy test, what if?"" Even though I knew there was no way I was pregnant. Isn't that the worst? Happy to say that's the last time I'll ever have that feeling! I got set up in my bed at pre-surgical daycare and was visited by the first nurse. She got my IV set up and did some initial tests for blood pressure, heart rate, etc. The IV catheter was in the back of my left hand and the slight sting of that was the worst pain I felt all day. The nurse let me know the doctor would stop by soon to check in. She wrapped me in a heated blanket before she left.

One of the surgical nurses and my surgeon stopped by to say hello, confirm the surgery they were performing, and asked if I had any questions about the procedure. I didn't have anything specific; I've read lots of stories from others on here and the childfree sub so I felt pretty prepared. They smiled and said they'd see me soon. Next, my anesthesiologist came by. She was the star of the show. She had such a wonderful bedside manner. She explained that general anesthesia was necessary for the procedure and gave me the risks. She asked if I had any questions, and before she left she patted my arm and said she'd take good care of me. That was incredibly reassuring.

My surgery was scheduled for 11:15am but at 10:15am they said they were ready to go so I was wheeled into the operating room. There was another doctor who said he was assisting and two other nurses. Everyone introduced themselves and their position. They hooked up the monitors and did a last safety check where they confirmed my identity and the procedure we were doing. They gave me some oxygen and the anesthesiologist said I'd be feeling a sensation in my left hand, which was the drugs. I closed my eyes and took some deep breaths and everything faded away.

I came to hearing a couple people saying my name and welcoming me back. It took a minute or so for me to fully come to my senses. I was propped up in a bed in the post-surgical ward and a nurse was sitting by my bed checking my vitals. The clock on the wall said 11:15am. I felt drowsy and a little out of it but otherwise alert. My nurse asked how I was feeling and I said fine. She commented that I was recovering really well, and mentioned that my anesthesiologist was very good at what she does. I had to agree. I had no pain or soreness. Didn't even feel like anything had happened. My throat was a little sore but not terrible, like I had been scream-singing at a good concert the night before.

My surgeon stopped by shortly after and said everything went very well. He said the procedure only took ten minutes. He asked to see me in his office in six weeks and that was it. I thought I would have a greater sense of relief, like a weight off my shoulders, but I don't think it's really hit me yet. I will say that I couldn't stop smiling as I laid there.

They kept me in that ward for about 45 minutes and then transferred me back to the surgical daycare. They called my husband and said he could pick me up in an hour, at 1:00pm. He got there early and sat by my side. We watched football together until the nurse came and said I could get dressed. It was slow going and I was dizzy once I started to move but still no pain or discomfort. They got me in a wheelchair and removed my IV. The discharge nurse asked if I get carsick and I said yes. It was my biggest worry because we had a 2.5hr drive home on a windy road, and I'm particularly prone to carsickness if I haven't eaten. The nurse said they gave me some IV meds for nausea, but she also gave me a peppermint patch that clipped to my shirt and that was an absolute game changer. I rested the whole drive home smelling faint whiffs of peppermint and didn't feel nauseous at all.

I felt a bit weird the rest of the day but overall really good. I started my meds before bedtime but I didn't take the opioids they prescribed. I had a bad experience when I got my wisdom teeth out so I wanted to avoid them if possible. Since Thursday, I've only taken extra strength Tylenol at regular intervals and I've been fine. I find if I don't take it regularly I start to feel sore and achy, like I had been in a mild car accident. 

I have thee incisions and two I don't feel at all. The one by my belly button is the one that twinges when I move, mainly when I sit/stand. Getting up out of bed or off the couch is quite comical. I remember reading one story where her husband got her a grabber and I was thinking that was genius. Reaching for something from the coffee table is an adventure. I haven't experienced much of any of the gas pain that others had described. My torso feels a bit...tight? If that makes sense? Not painful, but a bit uncomfortable, like wearing a shirt that's too small. Moving around and walking does help.

10/10 experience, would do again, but thankfully I will never have to! Hope this is helpful for any folks who are nervous for their procedure.

While in there ordering my drink I noticed a lady on her phone doing her thing.  She had on a Patagonia puffy vest. Northface and Xero shoes. 

I am very much into hiking and recently single. Also while not socially inept at times some things do pass me.

Anyway I approached and thinking she to was a hiker asked if there were any trails around this particular town or if she preferred the local state park.

She barely looked up and not even actually at me but to the side of me.
 Commenting ""You literally couldn't afford me."" 
She was back at her phone before she had finished the comment.

Now honestly I did not immediately take this as what it actually was. I misinterpreted the information.

I politely apologized saying ""I didn't realize you were a working girl."" As I am walking away I am trying to understand a couple of things.

For one why would an escort be in this little town.

Second why dress in outdoors gear.

I made about three steps before she got up saying ""Did you just call me a whore?""

""""No I thought you were an escort"" I replied.

She got really mad. Started going off on me.

I explained that no initially I thought she was an outdoorsy type person. It was only when she inferred she had a price that I thought otherwise. 
While I've never had business with escorts I have had conversation with them in the past.

After a bit more banter I felt the conversation was pointless, my drink was ready.

So the lady who made my drink was red faced laughing at the ordeal.

Anyway it's been 10 years since I've last been single and it just feels like I'm off to a stellar start.

1h3kziu,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1h3kziu/compatibilism_as_a_refuge_from_the_consuming/,Compatibilism as a Refuge from the Consuming Flame of Reality,"Compatibilism, at its core, offers a pseudo-scientific justification for systems that discard and harm those at the margins. It draws an arbitrary line between ""due"" and ""undue"" influence, allowing us to label certain actions as products of free will while absolving others as external coercion. But this division is not grounded in any objective reality; it is a convenient fiction, a veneer painted over the blood-soaked scaffolding of our societal structures. It is a story we tell ourselves to avoid facing the consuming flame of life—the interdependence that reveals the bodies upon which our privileges are built.  So let me correct the above.  This is a convenient fiction and is grounded in objective reality, but that is the objective reality of our sensitive intellects, raised unprepared to deal with the raw preconditions of our existence. 

The Starbucks latte in my hand is not an isolated object of pleasure. It is inseparable from the suffering of the homeless person on the corner and the Kenyan worker earning a dollar a day to produce the coffee beans. My morning comfort, my relative security, rests on a vast web of interconnections, and at its edges lie the discarded lives that fuel the machine of modern existence. Compatibilism functions as a mask, co-opting the language of libertarian free will to justify this machine while pretending it is built on something other than suffering.

If compatibilists were transparent, they would say outright: ""At this line of chronic vs acute influence, we are willing to discard people who are the consequences of our collective actions because we believe they are an acceptable human cost for our lifestyles."" But they do not. Instead, they frame their position as ""practical,"" hiding behind vague notions of ""undue influence"" to justify a justice system that burns people at the stake of our collective convenience... so we don't have to look at their pain and feel it too. This compassion short-circuit ensures the status quo remains intact. It avoids the visceral horror of admitting that our comforts—our warm homes, our tenure-track positions—are built on a foundation of suffering that we perpetuate and cannot even see to dismantle.

The line between ""due"" and ""undue"" influence is not a discovery but a fabrication, drawn to preserve privilege and power. It divides the world into those we deem responsible for their actions and those we pity, excusing systemic failures as individual flaws. It is no accident that the majority of philosophers embrace this position—it warms them in the comfort of their institutions while leaving the homeless in the cold.

Determinism lays bare a truth that compatibilism seeks to obscure: we are all inescapably interwoven, every action a thread in the tapestry of existence. The homeless person and the philosopher, the Kenyan worker and the latte drinker, are all necessary participants in this grand system of the whole cosmos. To recoil from determinism is to turn away from the consuming flame of this truth, and it is understandable.  It is to reject the reality that every privilege we enjoy is paid for by suffering somewhere else.  That's a lot to take in.

Compatibilists recoil because determinism forces them to confront that their actions—no matter how noble or well-intentioned—are inseparable from the machinery of harm. And so, instead of facing the fire, they construct their ""practical"" line, a barrier that keeps them safe from the stomach-churning horror of their complicity in harm, but also blinds them to their participation in all the actions contributing to peace.

The compatibilist framework is a refuge, a philosophical fortification against the terrifying implications of determinism. It is akin to the 19th-century pseudosciences that legitimized colonialism and slavery by cloaking exploitation in the language of reason. Just as those systems upheld power by disguising it as truth, compatibilism sustains meritocratic hierarchies by hiding their arbitrary and harmful nature behind intellectual sleight of hand.  The best predictor for future success remains, reliably, your zip code.

In doing so, compatibilists perpetuate a fictional story that benefits the privileged few at the expense of the many. They tell us that success is earned, that failure is deserved - as long as there is no ""undue"" influence - and that the systems of punishment and reward are grounded in some metaphysical justice. But determinism strips away this illusion. It reveals that these systems are not only unjustifiable (as all systems are) but also a relic of a worldview that cannot survive the fire of reality.

If compatibilists were to admit the truth—that their position is a pragmatic choice to sustain systems of harm—they would open the door to genuine reckoning in their hearts. This honesty would expose the costs of our privilege and force us to ask whether we are willing to continue paying them. It would strip away the comforting lies that justify suffering - ""they know better and deserve to suffer... nobody is holding a gun to their head"" - and invite us to confront the full weight of our collective actions.  It would reconnect our compassion circuits, cutting the bypass wires that narratives of deserving and ""due"" influence created. 

And in that confrontation lies forgiveness. The deterministic view does not seek to punish or condemn but to understand and transform. It recognizes that we are all participants in the system, not as independent agents but as interdependent connections in an infinite web. The flame that reveals our complicity also reveals our unity and our innocence... how we are also forgiven. In seeing the world as it truly is—perfect in its present necessity, horrific in its consequence—we can begin to imagine a new way of being. A way that does not rely on false divisions or arbitrary lines but embraces the fullness of our shared humanity.

Compatibilism, for all its pretense, cannot withstand the consuming flame of the truth of determinism. It cannot justify the suffering it perpetuates or the privilege it protects. But as the illusions burn away, what remains is not despair but possibility. The flame does not destroy—it transforms, revealing the raw material of a world that could be rebuilt on the foundation of truth rather than lies. And in that truth, there is hope.",0,1732996932.0,freewill,1,0.33,False

1h3kxyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/gout/comments/1h3kxyj/daily_vitamin_c_keeps_the_gout_away/,Daily vitamin C keeps the gout away,"Hi all, I would like to share how I've avoided any flares so far for a couple of years now. I've had gout for 18 years tried everything there is on the websites. I'm determined not to go on medication due to side effects. 

I was vegetarian for 8 years and that helped. I've quit alcohol for 10 years now but that didn't do much. Anchovies and turkey are the killers when it comes to uric acid. Chicken builds up over time. I tried cherry juice for a while and it worked a while but not quite. Flares still happened though less often. It's expensive and I suspected it's actually the vitamin C that makes it effective. 

While I've taken vitamin C occasionally, I decided to give it a test if it's indeed vitamin C that's playing the role. So I started to take 500mg day and night just before going to work and just before sleep. It has to be day and night if you intend to go back to normal diet since somehow it works to get rid of uric acid, prevent the flares or stops uric acid from crystallizing. Remember the flares at night when it's colder as it caused the acid to crystallise? 

I've never looked back since and that was 2 years ago, and vitamin C is really cheap with the added benefit of other health benefits. I don't have to watch the diet now but I still avoid anchovies and turkey just in case. Also I drink coffee in the mornings so vitamin C could be more effective because that. 

I would urge everyone to give it a try and let me know if it's as effective as it did for me. There are also few a few posts in this Reddit that mentioned how it has worked for them. The key difference I believe is in the dosage so that's 1000mg a day broken into 2 to ensure good coverage in 24 hours as excess vitamin C is very quickly cleared from the body. I believe it's actually this that helps clear out any uric acid. 

Also I want to mention if you are having high blood pressure also (like me before), then unfortunately I believe the high pressure is helping the acid crystallise so do try to reduce the pressure and there are many effective ways again other than lifetime medication, but that is another post.

Good luck on everyone's quest to be flare free!",0,1732996828.0,gout,0,0.5,False

1h3kqyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1h3kqyr/over_1_year_unemployed_and_thousands_of_job/,"Over 1 Year unemployed And Thousands Of Job Applications, Only 2 Interviews ","I have been unemployed for over a year now, the  job market as a whole is so bad, not just tech jobs. I have had a grand total of TWO interviews in the past 11 months of non stop applying to these jobs almost every day that I very well qualify for, resume modified curated for each job posts, cover letters specifically made for the job if the job application allows it, at least 2,000 jobs applied (according to Indeed, not including LinkedIn, applications on company websites, etc) and nearly all of them are ghosted or outright rejected. The 2 interviews I got were for JCPenney and Home Depot who ended up leaving me on read after the interview...

And no, I'm not applying to doctor jobs or whatever stuff I'm clearly not qualified for, I'm applying to retail jobs like TJMaxx, Nordstrom, Target, Walmart, minimum wage jobs that claim to be ""urgently hiring"", Tim Hortons, coffee shops, factory jobs, IT/software tech jobs (which is my main goal to get into), entry level jobs. None of these jobs have the intentions of actually hiring.

There was a factory in my area called Lacks Enterprise that had a giant hiring sign on the road saying ""Walk In Hiring"", so I walked into the factory and asked this lady if you're still hiring, she straight up said they haven't hired anyone in the last 2 months, ""we forgot to take down the sign"".

These tech jobs that I'm trying to ultimately get are not hiring entry level people it seems like, or it's so competitive it's basically useless to even attempt to get one when they all just end up ghosting or rejecting you. The job market for tech jobs is extremely terrible, it's like a senior only market. They want you to have 5 years of ""relevant work experience"" to even get an interview FOR ENTRY LEVEL JOBS, but will not give you that experience to get that. These companies will use all kinds of mind games on you like claiming ""we posted this job as entry level since it's entry into our company"" and other circus show explanations. And not just any kind of experience, because self-employment and freelancing isn't considered ""real work"" experience by a vast majority of these companies, it has to be a job that TheWorkNumber or something Equifax has a data on to verify employment...

These companies want to hire people with 10+ years of experience for near minimum wage and they know they can get away with this. I have seen so many job posts on Linkedin and Indeed from big companies saying you must have 10 years of experience with something like Next.js to qualify for even an OA, when Nextjs didn't even exist 10 years ago. Complete bullshit. How are entry level people suppose to start their life like this?

Don't get me started on these retail jobs. They're all automating their ""interviews"" by doing these one way video call of you speaking to yourself on camera which is bullshit because that's such an easy way for them to discriminate you, they can see how you speak, if you have an accent, your race, how old you are, how young you are, before you even get to speak to a human. Fuck Target and everyone else who does this racist bullshit. Have you ever wondered why places like Target only hire white teenage girls, I have never seen any asian boys like me working there? This isn't Microsoft, it's just another minimum wage retail job that acts like they're all fancy and stuff

Even Mcdonalds didn't give me an actual interview. I did their 64 question ""Psychometric Test"" which is just another word for IQ test and still got ghosted.

Any minimum wage jobs that use fucking Workday like Nordstrom, Five Below, Walmart, etc there's a 99% chance you're wasting your time because they'll just ghost you. Why the fuck do I need to make a brand new account for each job posts that use Workday when I KNOW I'll be ghosted either way?

And before you suggest this, no I do not add my bachelors degree on these minimum wage job applications (in some cases you can't either way if they have their own internal job application, you just submit your own contact info like phone number and email) since apparently everyone says these minimum wage jobs don't want to hire people with degrees because ""it makes you look like you'll leave in 3 months when you find better opportunities"", which is total bolony because there are no better opportunities in this era, this job would be the best thing I ever have.

I'm doing everything I can to try to reduce ways for these people to discriminate against me, including adding an ""American sounding"" first name like Sam, since my government first name is a Thai name...  If you ever seen Thai names, you know what I'm talking about

By the way, I live in the US, Michigan. No I do not require a sponsorship, I'm a US citizen thank you very much. The only indicator of why I'm being ghosted is because of my ethnic name which sounds Indian if you ever seen Thai names, which might make some of these employers have a bias but I don't even know at this point..

I don't care if these places pay me peanuts, I just want any job without being left on read so I can have them on my resume and maybe work my way up at that same place to where I want to be at the same company. Is it that hard to ask? I'm willing to sell my soul to these corporations if it means being paid salt and sugar as money at this point

I’m 22 he’s 23 so we’re still pretty young and this was both of ours first serious long term relationship. He’s the first guy I’ve truly loved. We had a healthy, trusting relationship. Neither of us were perfect but there were no major issues. Although I always had a weird feeling because when he would do things to upset me, he had a really hard time taking accountability. He always used his life as an excuse. I supported him through his stressful work life and tried to remind him he doesn’t need to be so hard on himself. But eventually I started becoming resentful because I didn’t always feel that support was reciprocated. I regret a lot of things and picking fights instead of using my words so sometimes I fear I pushed him away. I don’t know.

We came to a mutual decision to break up simply because he just wouldn’t fight for me. A few weeks prior, I had told him I needed a break because I had an issue with some girls he followed on instagram. He responded throwing everything he does for me in my face, saying he’s the best boyfriend around, and said “I’ll give you a week and you can decide what’s best.” No apology, no checking in with me, I was wrecked. I just wanted him to fight for me and show me that he truly loved me. 4 days later I caved and wanted to talk to him. I felt like I was dying without him. I didn’t get the apology I wanted but I couldn’t handle losing him. Then a few weeks go by and he’s traveling for work and I hadn’t seen him for a week. He comes home and I see a barstool bikini girl account in his twitter search history. I lost it. I was so hurt because I knew he was losing interest in me. That day for fought for hours and he did not show me he truly cared for me. I just wanted to hear things like “I’m so sorry can we work on this together” or “I can’t lose you let me make this up to you.” I decided we needed to break up and he agreed. 

We left things on good terms because he is truly a good person and I love him so much. We decide to keep in touch and “be friends” 🙄 dumb I know. 2 weeks later im out with my friends and I found out the day after we broke up he was out at a bar and told a girl we had broken up. But we had both agreed to keep this private and he told me he had only told his family. I freaked out. Called him drunk and he tried to accuse me of telling her first because she asked how if we were still together. I blocked him on everything. I regret the way I handled it but I was just feeling so hurt and blindsided. I was sick. Crying everyday and couldn’t even eat. I hated myself. I missed him so much and what we once had and where we had come to now. I just wanted him to show up and my door and make it all better. 

The next month or so I was in a cycle of going out, getting drunk, missing him like crazy, and occasionally calling him and showing up at his place. He would let me in and we would hook up and I would cry and tell him how much I missed him and loved him. He would tell me I don’t understand his life and don’t support him enough and he just can’t do it. This only made me want him more because I couldn’t handle rejection from someone who I once was their everything. He would tell me he would text me to get coffee and never would. I felt so worthless and weak. But I couldn’t stop. I found out he was on Hinge. Another knife in my heart. 

A couple weeks ago suddenly everything changed. He texted me about the election and we had a conversation. I asked him how he was doing because I still care about him so much. Not knowing what’s going on in his life killed me. Then I asked him to get coffee and go for a walk. We spent the day together and suddenly he’s acting like he wants to be with me again. I’m gonna be honest I initiated everything. Hanging out, staying in touch after, everything. I know what it means but still. Stupidly we start hanging out again to see where it goes and if we should get back together. I knew it was wrong but it felt so good to have him in my life again. He took me on a date, texting and calling me, it was like we were together again. But I was feeling so insecure and anxious. I broke down in front of him a few times telling him how I was so broken without him the last 2 months and pretty much depressed. He didn’t really make me feel any better. 

Then Wednesday night was when I knew it wasn’t gonna work. I had told him I was going out with my friends. He said he might too and if I needed a ride to call him. We’re texting and I told him where I was, no reply. An hour later I see him there. He walks up to me for a quick conversation, not trying to hang out with me or anything. I don’t hear from him the rest of the night. I just wanted atleast a text to check in and showed he cared. I would’ve loved to hang out with him for a little if he asked. I call him at midnight and ask him for a ride. Like he told me to. He sounds hesitant and tells me he has to drive his friends home first but if I want to wait an hour or so he could. Obviously I’m not waiting till 1 am for a ride home. I said never mind and that was it. I don’t get a text asking me if I got home safe, or telling me if he gets home safe. I was so upset once again. I don’t hear from him till the next morning. Night ruined Thanksgiving ruined. I felt like an after thought when he is my every thought. If tables were reversed I would’ve driven him home in a heartbeat and made sure he knew he was a priority to me. I told him yesterday I can’t do this anymore because I’m starting to lose myself. All I do is worry if he’s gonna leave me again and I need more reassurance from him after these last few months. He basically told me I was asking for too much without saying it. I’m clearly not a priority to him and never will be. I used to be which is why I’m so heartbroken. 

I know I made the right choice but I’m so sad. I cry so much and miss the days where we were each others worlds. I know there’s probably someone else or maybe he’s just emotionally unavailable. I’ve lost myself for this guy and fought for him with all I had. Why can’t he fight for me? Why can’t he just make me feel better? Maybe I’ll never know the answer. I would just like to hear people’s opinions to help me feel more confident in my decision. I know I will move on and need to not contact him but that’s all I want to do right now.

This is a post from someone who loved Medford and absolutely did not want to move, but found that PA has all the best parts of OR and then so much more. I keep seeing Oregon - and Medford in particular - ranked as the worst place to live and raise children and it compelled me to share my experience with you all.

---

I was happy living in Medford for a very long time. Moved there when I was 8 and didn't move away until I was 42 (although I did some 6-12 month stints in other cities for work a few times throughout the years). It took my wife and sons a lot of convincing to move out East. My oldest son going to college out here and me not wanting to split the family up was the tipping point. Boy am I glad I did.

I won't get into the real-estate issues in Medford, you all know what it is. We bought a 3,600 ft^2 house here that sits: 

* On over an acre in a community with a country club and a private lake
* Across from a massive ski lake that is several times the size of Lost Creek
* In a community where our local bar & grill is a 2 minute golf cart ride away. 
* A 4 minute golf cart ride away to our private beach on the big lake. 

We paid $400k for all of this in May of last year. It's probably worth $500k right now, but you can still buy a nice house around the lake for under $200k. Houses in our neighborhood range from $250k for a 3bd/2ba 1,500 ft^2 family home to $700k for something similar to what you would find up McAndrews. None of us have to drive to go have dinner or hang out at a bar or go boating. We all just get in our golf carts or UTVs and meet up.

Our community is only about 850 lots, but there are countless ones just like it all around the lake. Some focused more on quieter living, some that are geared more towards younger and active crowds, and all kinds in-between. There are also a lot of houses that aren't necessarily in ""communities"". I was worried about making friends in my 40s in a place where I knew nobody. First few months were rough, but the more we started getting out there and going to events, the more friends we made. Two years in, we now have more friends here than we could have imagined. The sense of community is like nothing I ever experienced in Medford. We lived in a lot of great neighborhoods, on the RVCC, Eagle Point golf course, etc. and never experienced anything like this. We have a private FB group of over 700 members for just our little community so we're all constantly engaged and planning events and helping each other. Hell, just the lake boating group has 16k members.

We loved the schools my wife and our children went to in Medford. Hoover, Lone Pine, Hedrick, and North. We were heavily involved in the schools and have nothing bad to say about them. Nothing is perfect, but in hindsight, the schools were the best part of living there. The schools here are funded better so there the classrooms are smaller, the equipment is better/newer, and the kids all get breakfast and lunch. I will say the the socio-economic divide is similar to Medford, so very much ""haves"" and ""have nots"" in the way schools like Hoover straddle that line. If you're a remote worker or a business owner, this place is paradise. I mean, this is my son's highschool for crying out loud. It's like straight out of a Disney show: https://imgur.com/a/B4HkZHh

In winter we get a proper amount of snow. We'll get a foot or two over night a few times a year and the kids get proper snow days. And people here are prepared. Just last weekend we got 20""+ and woke up to complete chaos. A friend of mine was in my driveway before I had my coffee plowing my driveway with his side-by-side even though he knows I have a blower on mine. The streets were plowed by noon and all the highways re-opened before evening. Tens of thousands of people who lost power had it back before 11pm. So while it does get a proper winter, we are prepared, so we just experience the fun parts. We're a short drive to several ski mountains. Hell, there is a community about 30 minutes from us with about twice the homes and they have a ski mountain that has 18 runs and 7 lifts and if you live there, you get free access to the mountain. Dues there are less than you'd spend on a family pack of lift tickets for Mt. Ashland. They also have horse stables (horses included), ATV trails, pools (adult and kid), an arcade, a restaurant in the community, etc. etc.

In the summer, it's all about the lake life. We haven't had to buy a boat because everybody we know has one. If you like the water, it's the place to be. Because the lake is only 60' deep, it is absurdly warm. I go swimming at midnight all the way into September because the water is still like 70F. There is an absurd number of events in the area all year long as well. Always something going on. Oh yeah, no fires. Like, none. We had a little smoke from Canada our first year here, but it was gone in two days. AQI stays near the 20s all year long.

We also have zero homeless. That's not an exaggeration. There are no transients here at all.

There is so much to do over here. Like Medford we have camping and boating and skiing, but unlike Medford it's a few minutes away. If we want to go a half our or an our away, that's fine too. There's still camping and boating and skiing. Our nearest metro area (375k) is 40 minutes away so it feels very much like living in a giant Jacksonville if Jacksonville was on a lake with 52 miles of shoreline. We're two hours from NYC and Philly and there is more culture in one town here than the entire state of Oregon. And travel... It's quicker for me to to travel to Europe from here than it was just to go to Hawaii from Medford. I can go round trip to Miami for the weekend for under $100. We can go hop on a dinner train at the local rail station 15 minutes away that transports you back in time. More venues and sports teams than you know what to do with. We have Disney World in place of Disneyland. The list just goes on and on.

It boggles my mind that a place like this exists in the US and I was too stubborn and scared to make a change.

Hi Reddit, I (37F) have been dating my girlfriend (33F) for a few months. This weekend, something happened that has me feeling hurt and left out, and I’d love some perspective.

For context, my girlfriend met my close friend through Bumble BFF before we started dating. They only met for coffee once before the three of us hung out together, which is when I met my girlfriend. My friend and I are very close—we share the same nationality, speak daily, and have a deep friendship. We meet sometimes, she’s been traveling a lot. My girlfriend and my friend, however, are not particularly close and have mostly interacted in group settings.

This weekend, my girlfriend made plans to meet my friend—without me. There was no suggestion or consideration of including me in their plans. Here’s what my girlfriend envisioned for the weekend:
- Friday night, we’d attend a DJ event together with her friend and another friend of mine, and afterwards we stay overnight at my place.
- On Saturday morning, we’d wake up, have breakfast/lunch and she’d hang out at my place until leaving to meet my friend alone. This usually means her leaving me behind in my tiny studio with no dishwasher and the mess of the night/breakfast to take care of.
- She intended to reconnect with me in the evening to spend the night together again at my place.

I was really upset by this arrangement. My friend is my close friend, and I found it odd and hurtful that my girlfriend didn’t think to include me. It also felt dismissive that she planned to “drop” me for part of the day, then resume our time together in the evening as if nothing had happened.
Instead, I asked her to stay at her place instead on Friday, which we did. Today, I’m the morning, she reminded me we didn’t have the whole day together and asked if we’d meet in the evening. At this point, I was upset but didn’t want to start an argument. I got ready to leave, and she noticed something was wrong. She insisted I stay for breakfast and kept asking to meet in the evening, but I declined each time, saying we’d meet the next day instead.
I haven’t directly told her why I’m upset yet. I know she doesn’t mean to hurt me, but this situation has left me feeling excluded and unconsidered. AITA for being upset about this? Should I have handled it differently?

Ps: for clarification, I’m not upset about them meeting alone, in fact I encourage their individual relationship. I’m upset about how my gf has planned it. I’d completely have invited my gf to come along if it was the other way round, if we were already spending the weekend together. Even though when she comes along, we have to speak English and not our language, and the quality of the interaction decreases because my friend and my gf aren’t that close. My friend hasn’t even mentioned the fact that they were meeting without me.
Ps2: there’s been other instances in which my gf, trying to maintain independence in the relationship, has acted in similar ways where she’s inconsiderate, for a lack of the better word.

Is one noticeably better than the other, or are they about the same?  With current discounts and sales, I'm just comparing these two machines.

1h3kft3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DungeonMarshal/comments/1h3kft3/body_and_soul_a_work_in_progress/,Body and Soul (a work in progress),"Some people believe in the immortality of the soul, but not Mr. Sutter, or ""Old Man"" Sutter, as he was colloquially referred to by his neighbors. That is, whenever he wasn't in earshot. He didn't buy into the nonsense about an immortal soul; instead, he held firm to the belief that not only does the soul die, but, in most cases, it does so long before the miserable shell that it inhabits will. Poor damn bodies just keep chugging along, ignorant of the fact that their long-time roommate won't be home for supper ever again.

The sun hadn't yet started its day's routine when Mr. Sutter was already pouring his first cup of coffee. He didn't need to set an alarm like in the days of his youth. Nowadays, he would just wake every hour or two until he decided he was finally finished with the teeter-totter ride and start the same day over again that he started the day before and the day before that. He ran a calloused hand up and down the right side of his face to survey three days' worth of bristle there. His consideration to shave hadn't lasted one round while in the ring with its unevenly matched opponent, *What's the Point?*, the heavyweight champion of Mr. Sutter's lasting mindset.

Sutter didn't know exactly when *his* soul gave up the ghost, but he was confident that it was long dead. No eulogy was given for it, and no obituary was ever written for it. But it *was* entombed and in a glass casket no less, for any and all to behold who dare look upon its pitiful dried husk. All they need to do is look into Mr. Sutter's tired eyes.

As a child and even a young adult, that soul of his shined through those eyes with a far greater luster than a mountain of diamonds catching a sunrise. They burned like suns of their own, fueled by the desire to experience life. He often thought his eyes had been his most commanding feature. Maybe his *only* commanding feature. But now? Now, those eyes didn't shine anymore. They harbored only the desiccated remains of what was.

Although the soul just up and died without any kind of warning, and despite its life not having been celebrated with the usual pomp and ceremony that is common for its much less interesting lodging place, the body, when it dies, the soul, like any other loved one, leaves behind memories. Mr. Sutter remembered clearly how he felt while his soul was still alive and healthy. He remembered how much it enjoyed riding a bicycle down blistered summer roads and the sound the tires would make running over the sticky asphalt. The music it created just as well had been composed by Mozart himself; it was so damn beautiful. And he remembered how his soul would treat him with a certain, indescribable magical feeling when he would wake in the morning with the window open no more than a crack. The chill of the autumn air permeated the room and left the tip of his nose frozen, while the rest of him was warm and snug beneath layers of heavy blankets. He remembered the powerful radiating force his soul would emit while eating a bowl of hot oatmeal prepared by his mother after he had been playing in knee-deep snow drifts all morning long. How the steam would carry the scent of warm cinnamon to frolic around his face as he shoveled spoonful after spoonful. Then there was the memory of Sherry Erving sitting in the passenger seat of his old '77 Oldsmobile; she was wearing that red t-shirt that might've been a little too tight for modesty. Vividly, he could recall what felt like going warp speed down that country road, left hand on the wheel, right hand clutching Sherry's right shoulder. All the windows down and warm summer air rushing over them and whipping their hair into a chaotic frenzy; all the while, Taylor Dayne's voice blasting from the radio, demanding that someone tell something to her heart, and they, doing their best to sing along with her. Man! His soul especially loved that night.

Now things were different, and Old Man Sutter knew it. Even if he tried to relive those old joys, he'd just be going through the motions. And he'd probably look the damn fool to boot. And oatmeal? He could do with or without it. The body finds no joy in oatmeal. It only brings pleasure to the soul. Yes, there was no doubt; his soul was deceased. Maybe it was poisoned a little bit here and there until, at last, it succumbed to the toxin. Or maybe it was beat to death with the rhythmic, hard-hitting blows of daily routine. It may have just been crushed to paste by the mighty weight of responsibility. Whatever the case, it was truly and unarguably dead. Departed. Gone. No more.

About eight years ago . . . Ten years ago? Twelve? Hell! He didn't know. Being able to tell time by weeks, months, and years must've been business for the soul because now, time bled together something awful. What Mr. Sutter thought might've happened a year or two back may have actually been upwards of four years ago. But some time ago, however long, he had heard Sherry Erving was now Sherry Young; she taught high school English class (had been for years), and she had two kids of her own. He oftentimes wondered if it had been that Brian Young prick that she married. He didn't completely know why, and he knew full well that it was none of his concern either way, but he had hoped that it wasn't.

Old Man Sutter had been married once, too. Almost a full year. She vanished nearly as quickly as his soul had. Although he was much quicker to notice her absence when she was gone. She may have been the first to give his soul a little drop of poison. A parting gift before she began a new life. Who knows? All the paperwork was passed along through the ""friendly"" hands of the postal carrier, who (he was sure) would look at him with daggers after she would bluntly state, ""I need you to sign here, Mr. Sutter."" As she left, ""Have a good day, Mr. Sutter,"" and the toothiest damn smile he ever saw. That was almost thirty-two years ago. He could still see that patronizing, toothy smile as clearly as if it was a photograph. And whenever he thought about it, his face flushed, and he muttered very unpleasant words.

Not too long after Mr. Sutter's soul died, an unruly bunch made themselves at home. Cynicism seemed to be the leader of the group. Then there was Cynicism's kid brother, and second in command, Bitterness. A day wouldn't go by without Mr. Sutter hearing from both of them. They were always quick to offer their bombastic opinions. Arthritic Knees really liked to make themselves known too and were bad company for the other two, often instigating them into bad behavior. Mr. Sutter didn't know if they had rightly inherited what was once his soul's property or if they were simply opportunistic squatters that saw a void and filled it. Either way, he didn't like their company nearly as much as he had enjoyed that of his soul's.

Mr. Sutter groaned and lowered himself into his recliner. When he did this, his knees made the kind of crunching, crackling sound one might expect to hear if they were to gently squeeze a bag of cereal. Hearing that sound bothered him a few years ago, but now it was so commonplace that he hardly gave it a second thought. He pulled the lever on the side of the chair, and the footrest kicked up with a metallic twang and a pop. Then he shifted once, twice, and a third time until he was as close to comfortable as he was likely to get.

Television was the same every day. The world was on fire, and everyone trying to fight against it was using buckets of gasoline. Some days television just depressed him. Other days it left him angry and disgusted. But every day he watched. What else was there to do for an old man with no family, no job, and no soul?

It wasn't too long before the television lulled Mr. Sutter back to sleep. As he sat and napped, images of Sherry Erving, that postal carrier, and the factory where he once worked all played around in his head. And Brian Young, too. Brian Young, whom he had not seen since long before he was ""Old Man"" Sutter. Back then, he was simply Rick. Ricky to his friends. But Brian Young was not among that small group of people.

Brian Young was a senior in high school when Mr. Sutter was a sophomore, and he called him neither Rick nor Ricky. He preferred instead to call him Dick. And instead of Sutter, he would say ""Sucker."" That always got plenty of laughs from everyone. There were other petty torments as well, but none that stung quite as painfully or that were as memorable as that stupid nickname. Sticks and stones may break your bones, but names will haunt you forever.

Mr. Sutter woke to the sound of someone knocking at his front door. At that sound, anxiety ran up and down Mr. Sutter's spine like a rabbit, not knowing which side of the road it wanted to escape to in order to avoid the car that was barreling towards it. Company wasn't something Mr. Sutter was used to. In truth, it wasn't something he enjoyed. Especially when it was unexpected.

After a few moments, the rapping at the front door repeated itself. For one fleeting moment, Mr. Sutter considered ignoring it. He found that his mother's well-intentioned advice to deal with bullies was far more effective against unwanted company. ""Ignore them, and they'll go away."" But finally he conceded, lowered his footrest, and grunted as he stood. ""Just a moment,"" he yelled as he reached for a shirt to throw on.

Mr. Sutter once heard a fella on television tell someone else that the universe was indifferent. He wasn't too sure if he could get on board with that train of thought or not. It sure as hell seemed to like its practical jokes it would occasionally pull on people. Those little moments of irony and coincidence that leave people blinking in dumbfounded disbelief. No. Mr. Sutter was sure that the universe had a sense of humor, and more often than not, people were made the butt of the joke.

Before he opened the door, Mr. Sutter glanced out the window to see who it was that was disturbing him. Some kid he'd never seen before was standing with his back to the door, staring across the street where a moving van was parked. A ""kid."" He must've been in his early or mid-twenties, but still a kid in the eyes of Old Man Sutter. He unlocked the door and opened it part way.

*Who are you? What do you want? I hope this isn't going to take long*, was what he was thinking. He said, ""Can I help you?""

The kid turned and smiled. Mr. Sutter was certain he'd never seen him before, but there was something familiar about him. ""Hi! Good morning,"" he said, sunshine oozed from his lips. ""I just moved in next door. I wanted to introduce myself.""

*Oh! Boy! A new neighbor. And an outgoing one. Great. Well, I hope you don't plan on popping over here any ol' damn time you feel like it*. ""Oh! Well, welcome to the neighborhood,"" Mr. Sutter said, not knowing what else to say. Here, he opened the door a little wider and held his hand out to shake. ""Rick Sutter.""

""It's good to meet you, sir."" Taking Mr. Sutter's hand, he gave it a firm shake and continued, ""I'm Brian. Brian Young Jr.""",1,1732995432.0,u_DungeonMarshal,0,1.0,False

1h3kbsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1h3kbsb/i_will_literally_work_for_free/,I Will Literally Work For Free,"I have been unemployed for over a year now, the overall job market is so bad, not just tech jobs. I have had a grand total of TWO interviews in the past 11 months of non stop applying to these jobs almost every day that I very well qualify for, resume modified curated for each job posts, cover letters specifically made for the job if the job application allows it, at least 2,000 jobs applied and nearly all of them are ghosted or outright rejected. The 2 interviews I got were for JCPenney and Home Depot who ended up leaving me on read after the interview...

And no, I'm not applying to doctor jobs or whatever stuff I'm clearly not qualified for, I'm applying to retail jobs like TJMaxx, Nordstrom, Target, Walmart, minimum wage jobs that claim to be ""urgently hiring"", Tim Hortons, coffee shops, factory jobs, IT/software tech jobs (which is my main goal to get into), entry level jobs. None of these jobs have the intentions of actually hiring.

There was a factory in my area called Lacks Enterprise that had a giant hiring sign on the road saying ""Walk In Hiring"", so I walked into the factory and asked this lady if you're still hiring, she straight up said they haven't hired anyone in the last 2 months, ""we forgot to take down the sign"".

These tech jobs that I'm trying to ultimately get are not hiring entry level people it seems like, or it's so competitive it's basically useless to even attempt to get one when they all just end up ghosting or rejecting you. The job market for tech jobs is extremely terrible, it's like a senior only market. These companies want to hire people with 10+ years of experience for near minimum wage and they know they can get away with this. I have seen so many job posts on Linkedin and Indeed from big companies saying you must have 10 years of experience with something like Next.js to qualify for even an OA, when Nextjs didn't even exist 10 years ago. Complete bullshit. How are entry level people suppose to start their life like this?

Don't get me started on these retail jobs. They're all automating their ""interviews"" by doing these one way video call of you speaking to yourself on camera which is bullshit because that's such an easy way for them to discriminate you, they can see how you speak, if you have an accent, your race, how old you are, how young you are, before you even get to speak to a human. Fuck Target and everyone else who does this racist bullshit. Have you ever wondered why places like Target only hire white teenage girls, I have never seen any asian boys like me working there? This isn't Microsoft, it's just another minimum wage retail job that acts like they're all fancy and stuff

Even Mcdonalds didn't give me an actual interview. I did their 64 question ""Psychometric Test"" which is just another word for IQ test and still got ghosted.

Any minimum wage jobs that use fucking Workday like Nordstrom, Five Below, Walmart, etc there's a 99% chance you're wasting your time because they'll just ghost you. Why the fuck do I need to make a brand new account for each job posts that use Workday when I KNOW I'll be ghosted either way?

And before you suggest this, no I do not add my bachelors degree on these minimum wage job applications (in some cases you can't either way if they have their own internal job application, you just submit your own contact info like phone number and email) since apparently everyone says these minimum wage jobs don't want to hire people with degrees because ""it makes you look like you'll leave in 3 months when you find better opportunities"", which is total bolony because there are no better opportunities in this era, this job would be the best thing I ever have.

I'm doing everything I can to try to reduce ways for these people to discriminate against me, including adding an ""American sounding"" first name like Sam, since my government first name is a Thai name...  If you ever seen Thai names, you know what I'm talking about

By the way, I live in the US, Michigan. No I do not require a sponsorship, I'm a US citizen thank you very much. The only indicator of why I'm being ghosted is because of my ethnic name which sounds Indian if you ever seen Thai names, which might make some of these employers have a bias but I don't even know at this point..

I don't care if these places pay me peanuts, I just want any job without being left on read so I can have them on my resume and maybe work my way up at that same place to where I want to be at the same company. Is it that hard to ask? I'm willing to sell my soul to these corporations if it means being paid salt and sugar as money at this point

Is anyone else in the same situation?",1,1732995130.0,jobs,6,0.54,False

Oui, celle qui a déjà une machine à café parfaitement fonctionnelle. Mais là, attention, c’est une machine ""verte"", donc ça passe. Je suis sûr qu'elle sera ravie de recevoir une machine flambant neuve qui ne fonctionne qu’avec des boules compactées ultra-spécifiques, fruits d’un traitement industriel de haute précision, totalement indispensable, bien sûr.

Et ces boules ? Emballées dans des cartons recyclés, évidemment. Parce que, comme tout le monde le sait, fabriquer un emballage recyclé, c’est gratuit en énergie, neutre en carbone, et fait pousser des fleurs dans les champs. Une vraie leçon d’écologie moderne.

Pitié, lisez les commentaires sur cette merveille de technologie ! Sérieusement, ils valent le détour. Entre ceux qui sont persuadés de sauver la planète en achetant ça et les experts en greenwashing, c’est un spectacle garanti.

Et un immense merci au marketing pour cette invention lumineuse, à la pub bien ficelée qui fait rêver les consommateurs, au cahier des charges pour les ingénieurs merveilleusement bien pensé, aux commerciaux qui ont réussi à convaincre des gens que produire toujours plus, sous un vernis ""recyclé"" , était un acte écologique.

Franchement, chapeau bas à toute la chaîne. C’est du grand art. Je n’arrive toujours pas à croire que ça fonctionne, mais visiblement, ça marche. Bravo à eux, et bravo à nous pour tomber dans le panneau avec le sourire !

Joyeux noël et achetez cette machine, vous en avez besoin !

1h3k5fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h3k5fo/i_worked_as_a_satellite_engineer_in_1999_i_know/,I worked as a satellite engineer in 1999. I know the truth about the Art Bell Area 51 caller.,"I work, or rather, used to work, as a satellite engineer in upstate New York. My job was to listen to the stars. Most people picture satellite engineers as eggheads crunching numbers in sterile labs, but my work is more… intimate. I sat in a control room full of softly humming equipment, scanning the sky, monitoring signals from satellites, and occasionally listening for things that shouldn't be there.

It was during one of those quiet shifts that I heard it.

The night started off normal. I was alone in the monitoring station, halfway through my shift, sipping burnt coffee while flipping through static-filled audio channels. My job that evening was routine: confirm telemetry signals from a low-orbit satellite and ensure no interference from nearby communications. The air conditioning buzzed faintly above me, and the hum of my console was almost comforting.

But then something unusual caught my attention. My second monitor, set to stream live AM frequencies, had picked up the Coast to Coast AM broadcast. It was a tradition among night workers to leave Art Bell’s show playing in the background—his late-night topics about the paranormal, UFOs, and conspiracy theories were like a dose of caffeine for the imagination. That night, the subject was the infamous Area 51.

“Let’s go to the wildcard line,” Art’s voice came through. “You’re on the air.”

What followed chilled me.

“I—I don’t have a lot of time...” The caller’s voice was frantic, cracking with fear. “They’ll triangulate on this position quickly.”

I paused my work and turned up the volume. Art kept his cool. “What are you talking about, sir? You’re on a secure line.”

The man’s voice quivered, his words tumbling over each other. “I used to work at Area 51. I—I was let go on a medical discharge about a week ago... I’ve been running ever since.”

I leaned closer to the monitor, my coffee forgotten. There was something terrifyingly genuine in his voice. It wasn’t the usual rambling of a conspiracy nut. This man was scared.

“What were you doing at Area 51?” Art asked. “And why are you running?”

“They’re gonna—” the man choked on his words. “They’ll catch me. They’ve been monitoring all the calls, and they’ll shut this down.”

Art tried to calm him down. “Slow down. What are they after you for?”

The caller hesitated, then his words tumbled out in a rush. “They’re not what you think. The stuff we’re dealing with at Area 51—it’s not extraterrestrial. They’re extradimensional! They’re not from space... they’re from other places, other dimensions. And they’re infiltrating... everywhere.”

The line crackled with static. For a moment, I thought we’d lost the signal, but the caller came back, his voice growing more desperate.

“They feed on chaos. That’s why they let us see the UFOs—it’s to keep us looking in the wrong direction. They don’t want us to know what they’re really doing! They’re preparing Earth for colonization—terraforming it to suit them!”

I gripped the edge of my desk, feeling an irrational fear clawing its way into my chest. Art’s voice broke through the tension. “Sir, you’re making some very big claims. Is there any proof you can share with us?”

Before the caller could respond, the signal just dropped. There was nothing. My monitor’s display flickered, and the stream froze. When it resumed, Art was speaking again, but the frantic caller was gone.

“Well, uh, we seem to have lost that line,” Art said, his usual composed demeanor slightly shaken. “That was… strange.”

I rewound the broadcast on my monitor and captured the audio. Something about the distortion in the interference felt deliberate. I ran the recording through an analyzer, isolating the cut off from the call. My heart sank when I realized it wasn’t random noise. It was a signal.

The signal contained coordinates—deep in the Nevada desert, not far from Area 51.

I didn’t know what to make of it. Part of me wanted to dismiss it as a prank, but my gut told me otherwise. I’ve spent years listening to signals from space, analyzing every anomaly, and this wasn’t something you’d stumble upon by accident. Someone—or something—wanted to stop that man from talking.

Later that night, I tried to call into Coast to Coast AM to ask Art if he’d heard anything else from the caller, but I couldn’t get through. The line kept disconnecting, and eventually, I gave up. I went home, exhausted but unable to sleep. That’s when things started to get strange.

The next morning, I found my work access restricted. My keycard wouldn’t open the doors at the station, and my login credentials had been revoked. When I called my supervisor, he acted like he didn’t know me. It didn’t make sense. I’d worked there for years.

Then the SUV showed up.

It was parked across the street from my apartment, engine idling. At first, I thought it was a coincidence, but it kept returning. Different times, same vehicle. Blacked-out windows. No plates.

That night, I woke up to static. My clock radio was blaring white noise at full volume. I stumbled out of bed to turn it off, but then I heard the voice—his voice—cutting through the static.

“They know you heard it. They know you’re listening. Stop.”

The radio went dead.

I didn’t sleep after that. I packed a bag, left my apartment, and started driving. I didn’t know where I was going, just that I couldn’t stay. I’ve been off the grid ever since, hiding in a cabin in the Rockies. No internet. No phone.

Sometimes, late at night, I turn on the shortwave radio I keep for emergencies. And sometimes, buried in the static, I hear the voice again.

“They’re coming. And you can’t run forever.”",9,1732994647.0,nosleep,1,0.91,False

I recently purchased a Fellow Ode gen 1, and I'm thankful for previous troubleshooting posts in this sub because they've helped me address some of the issues I'm having with intense levels of mess caused by static cling as well as frequent jams. But it's still a pretty temperamental machine that I have to coax and cajole every time I want to grind. I had the Baratza Encore previously and although it was not as premium-built, it didn't have these problems for the year+ I used it. 

My Fellow Stagg EKG has also started having issues with the LCD screen turning on but then turning right back off again. This is new behavior as I've been using the Stagg for over a year daily with no issues. 

I'm looking into repair solutions for the Stagg, but I'm no longer feeling like Fellow is a one-stop shop for coffee gear. Basically, I'm wondering if people have alternate suggestions for burr grinders and temperature-controlled kettles that are durable and worth the price.",2,1732994429.0,pourover,0,0.75,False
1h3k0uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmhocpress/comments/1h3k0uf/mp_polka_gets_a_job_at_tim_hortons/,MP Polka Gets a Job at Tim Hortons,"*Amid the missing government and lack of any progress in the House, MP Polka has decided to get a job at Tim Hortons. During her first shift, she talks to customers.*

**Polka:** It is an honor to begin this job at one of Canada’s most esteemed institutions: Tim Hortons. Their coffee has always been my favorite, much better than Starbucks I’ll tell you. And well, with the government being at a standstill these days I’m honestly looking for a job, and I’ve always wanted to work at Tim Hortons.

So many hardworking Canadians have worked or currently work at Tim Hortons. With much of our government currently missing in action, including NDP Prime Minister Drebin, the Speaker, Cabinet officials, multiple MPs, and even the budget document itself, I decided I could make more of a difference for Canadians by working here at Tim Hortons rather than in Ottawa, which is basically deserted these days.

There is no better way to understand the lives and hardships of everyday Canadians by working at a place like Tim Hortons. That is something my colleagues from the Liberal and New Democratic Parties, most of whom it appears have locked themselves in their offices, do not seem to understand. So while my colleagues are off avoiding their government responsibilities, I’m here serving Canada’s best coffee and getting to know my constituents.

**Customer:** What’s your favorite thing to order at Tim Hortons?

**Polka:** Hmm, I’d have to say the vanilla iced latte and a honey dip donut. But I honestly love everything at Tim Hortons.

*Polka then begins making and serving orders.*

**Polka:** Just look how great these coffees look. Considering government has basically been shut down since a day after I took office, I have to say I think I’m already having the opportunity to get much more done here than I was at the House of Commons.

*A customer approaches wearing a red “Make Canada Great Again” hat.*

**Polka:** Wow, look at this guy. He’s a Conservative guy all the way. I’m glad to know our slogan for the next election is catching on. We need to make sure it’s too big to rig so we don’t have a missing government like this again with the Liberal-NDP coalition in power. And for you sir, there will be no charge for the coffee. MP Polka is paying for it. Is that ok?

**Customer:** We love the Conservatives. Conservative majority for 2024!

*Polka serves many more customers throughout her shift, answering customer questions as she works*

**Customer:** The Conservative Party has sounded a little divisive lately, so I’m not sure if I should vote for you guys. What do you say to that?

**Polka:** Well, I think the NDP and Liberals are the most divisive people I’ve ever met. They abandon their government responsibilities, they’ve told some horrible lies. And I think it shows up in the polls. Yeah. I think the Conservatives are the ones that bring everyone together. And if we win a majority you’ll get the greatest economy we've ever had and the best job numbers ever, the best border ever. The Border Services Agency, by the way, for those that haven't heard, the Border Services a couple of days ago gave us their complete and total endorsement. They said, ""Conservatives will give us the best government we've ever had,"" and they said, ""the Liberal-NDP coalition is the worst we've ever seen at the border.""

*At the end of her first shift, she speaks to the customers in the coffee shop once more.*

**Polka:** Are you having a good time today, everybody? It's pretty good, right? Pretty good. We served a lot of great people today and I met a lot of great coworkers. They kept saying when are you going to get to work? And I said let's go to Tim Hortons since there is nothing that is able to be done in the government right now. So, that's it. I hope that voters recognize the efforts of the Conservatives, which is currently the only party even attempting to communicate with the public about what’s going on. And the latest polls are looking good for us, we’re leading by a good amount.

By getting this job at Tim Hortons, I’m showing the Canadian voters who MP Polka really is. I want to be myself. All I want to do is be myself. Canadians know what they'll get if the Conservatives win the majority. They’ll get the best economy ever. They’ll have the strongest border ever. We’ll have a military that defeats threats in record times. Ever since the Liberal-NDP coalition took office, our country has been getting ripped off, I’ll tell you. They took their offices and then disappeared, and it is rumored they’re even holding some of my fellow Conservatives hostage and forcing them to undergo DEI training. This can’t be happening folks. And now, we’re leading in every swing province. Those are pretty good odds. I like that, I like it a lot. I'll take that right now, right?

*A livestream of Polka’s shift was also broadcasted on TikTok.*

**Polka:** How many, views on TikTok guys? TikTok- tell me, how many hits do we have on TikTok? Ten billion views. And that's TikTok. Amazing. The enthusiasm our country has for Conservatives. Very impressive. Thank you everyone.",2,1732994304.0,cmhocpress,0,1.0,False

1h3jzai,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h3jzai,Pgh Bookstore Tour: White Whale & Big Idea (#2 & #3),"Background: read this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/s/Cwj4IUAIEC) for the full background on how it came to be.
(I will link below the OP)

I was in Lawrenceville for an appt & decided to hit up the White Whale due to proximity & popularity/recs on Reddit.

White Whale: 
Given it was small business Saturday, I should have anticipated the crowds — it was BUSY around 11AM.  The first part of the store was small, and with the crowd, I found it a bit difficult to shop.  I wanted to shop childrens books, but that section was a small corner & even one family bowsing with their babe made  it not possible.  

I was actually a little surprised to see the second section of the store had more books (and wasn’t just the coffee shop).  Kudos for that.  

I purchased the book  & a latte  and chatted a bit with the barista who was very friendly.  I did want to buy beans (they sell Commonplace) but it was so busy I felt rushed.  

All in all, it was a good neighborhood bookstore, but I would say my experience overall wasn’t remarkable.  I did like the copious staff recommendation tags.  I also wanted to leave with a bag of coffee beans, but because of how busy it was, I was somewhat disappointed. I couldn’t actually buy the product that I wanted to.

I was stopped by a patron on my way out who overheard about my book tour & reminded me about Big Idea.


Big Idea Bookstore & Cafe
I —really— liked this bookstore.  It is a non-profit that seems to run off volunteers.  They market as …. We’re an anarchist collective that provides space for exploring radical ideas and putting them into action, established in 2001.

The Big Idea practices anticapitalist, nonbinary, antioppressive, and intersectional values and promote them through books, events, and conversations. We aim to foster a culture of resistance and mutual aid that celebrates individual and collective autonomy.”  If you want a winter romance novel, this is not the store for you.  

I love political & social justice reading, so this place was right up my alley.  They also have great sketchbooks & notebooks.  The cafe reminds me of the Beehive circa 2002.  


Although I left without my beans, I didnt get a parking ticket this time and checked off 2 more bookstores from my list :)

1h3jy2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1h3jy2e/thin_lining_after_breast_cancer_treatment/,Thin lining after breast cancer treatment ,"Hi everyone. I’m struggling with a thin lining and have had two cancelled cycles so far. Previously, they got it up to 4.5, and this last time, the highest was 5.4. I’ve had two hysteroscopies and a uterine biopsy that came back normal except the endometrial glands weren’t very active. 

I had breast cancer almost three years ago and went through chemo and two years of anti-hormone therapy (Letrozole and Lupron to shut down my ovaries). I went off the medication last February. My period has not returned (I’m 41 and according to my labs, I’m not even perimenopausal but they said it can take awhile for my period to return, even up to a year or longer). 

I froze half eggs/embryos with my husband prior to starting chemo so we are trying to use those. They may be the only chance I got (in France, they don’t do egg retrievals after age 42 and right now, they don’t think I’d be able to have much success with a retrieval, but I have 8 eggs and 4 embryos. They don’t do PGT testing here so not sure o no quality). 

My doctor told me that he’ll let me know next week what the next steps will be (he sits down with other doctors in the field and will discuss my case). He said they may just aim for 5, and I’ve heard some people have success with thinner linings, but that makes me nervous since I have limited eggs/embryos. 

What we tried so far: 

With every cycle: 100mg aspirin, vitamin D, vitamin E, Folic Acid

First cycle - two estrogen pills morning and night. When that failed, one estrogen suppository morning and night. 

Second cycle: one estrogen suppository at night. Then, they made it morning and night and added estrogen patches. That got me to 5.4. 

I cut out all coffee and most caffeine except an occasional tea. I walk a lot, at least 30 minutes every day and usually a lot more (I live in Paris and don’t drive).  

I get two years off my anti-hormone meds and it’ll be one year in February, though I’ll probably take extra time (I shouldn’t but it’s a bit late for that now). 

I’m just hoping to hear successes with stories like mine and connect with others who understand the struggle. ",3,1732994103.0,IVF,10,1.0,False

1h3jx4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1h3jx4a/how_am_i_supposed_to_feel/,how am I supposed to feel?,"ok before I start, I must say, I have a backup account on Grindr which, sometimes, I use to ""test"" the guys who I've met and liked. I know it sounds pathetic in a sense and it also sounds stalky, to say the least.

Context: I live in Asia, and I'm attracted to caucasians and only caucasians. For the past 3 years of my life, I've only ever met them, mostly older types (37yo and above). I also have this habit of being dangerously attached to them, after I meet them and if they showed any feelings for me. It's to the point where I think about them day and night, constantly about that fantasy relationship I have with them, up until another person comes and shows me more feelings, then that attachment will cling onto them instead. (sorry if it seems confusing, i am just now trying to control my feelings.)

A few months back, I met this older gentlemen (Let's call him M). Tall, quite toned, a silver fox and he doesn't look like his age at all, in fact younger. One Friday night, was just looking for some action and he replied to me. Was a dream come true to have someone out of my league to ask me to come over. Long story short, I came over, he fucked me good and that was that. I did like him very much and we exchanged numbers. At this point, I still couldn't believe he was single. 

Fast forward the next day, I was hesitant to message him but did anyways, and I got a reply back asking if I wanted to meet for coffee over at the airport. I live near the airport and of course I said I could accompany him, since he was flying off that night too. It was date. We spent the evening just chatting and spending time together and everything felt perfect to the point I was feeling some sparks and.. love? I also got to know his last relationship ended badly with his ex because M had some stuff stolen.  I felt bad and I didn't pursue the relationship talk any further. When he went off to departure, we were still chatting in text, and he said something along the lines of ""don't fall in love witth me as I won't be able to give it back, if you end up falling in love with me, I'll have no choice but to block you. I have had a great time with you, let's leave it at that. But if you ever come to Europe or want to travel somewhere together, let me know."" So that would meant, he's not looking to get into a relationship... right? Or maybe i'm not good enough for him?

Of course I was sort of upset and frustrated that my fantasy relationship had come to an end, and I couldn't stop thinking about him up until now. I even sent a message a few days ago, asking if he wanted to come with me to Japan since I was planning to go there next year, and he said he wanted to explore more of Asia. But alas, I have been left on read for the past 6 days.

Now comes the time where I'll be seen as creepy and just down bad to say the least. I used my extra grindr account, to message him, and to catfish him, into just seeing what he would respond. Used a different picture and everything, another asian photo of course. But the thing that got me sort of heartbroken was when I asked him, do you have a boyfriend/do you want a boyfriend? And he reply with a ""yesss, but I am demanding though"" 

I played along, and got to know his demands include smart, rich, intelligent, good in bed, etc. Not to brag but i'm 6/7 of what he mentioned 🥲. And of course I played along saying im a few of those and ask if it was acceptable? he said yess, and asked if we could meet when he was back from vacation. I had to just lie and said I won't be in the area and I'll be back home by then.

So, did I just hurt myself accidentally by finding out someone who I liked, loved even, was looking for a relationship, but when I showed interest, he'd rather just block me and leave me on read? I know, I know, pretty stupid of me to try and dig drama up when I could just leave things be and live in a fantasy world. But I can't. I won't stop thinking of this guy anytime soon and I can't get over the feelings of anger and jealousy to the point where I just go for 5k runs to clear my mind, and so that I could look better than whatever twink he thinks looks good.
What do I do? How do I get over him? Also, he left me on read when I asked about him coming to Japan with me, so do I just wait for him to send back a reply? or do I fire something off? I don't wanna look desperate 

TLDR; I catfished someone I liked/loved, and found out he's looking for a relationship, even though he told me he wasn't looking to date. I can't get over it, and I'm having jealousy build up, which I can feel will turn into depression if I don't vent it out somehow",1,1732994033.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

Malachi, better known to the world under his metahuman alias Bulwark, was having trouble getting comfortable in the small metal chair. The coffee shop smelled overwhelmingly of dark roast, a local favorite in the neighborhood. Though the shop was packed to the windows with all manner of customers, filling the space with clamor and conversation, they were all rendered invisible by the event unfolding before Malachi.

Sitting on the other side of a target-colored table was a thin, pale, gaunt man, whose hair was equally wispy. The man sipped his cappuccino from a small cup, gray eyes locked on the hulking mass shifting uncomfortably in the seat opposite him. He said nothing in the immediacy of their first unmasked encounter.

Malachi grunted, nudging his chair away from the table so he could breathe a little easier. ""So, you're Guillotine?""

""Was,"" the man known as Guillotine responded, his silky voice starkly betraying his otherwise weak appearance, ""Call me Alfred. It's my given name.""

""Why are you telling me this?"" Malachi asked, leaning forward. ""You know you're making yourself vulnerable to me. This isn't normal.""

Alfred's gaze shifted to the table as he lowered his cup. ""Nothing has been normal for a while, Bulwark. Sudden shifts in the ways we live can prompt... unimaginable behaviors.""

""What are you talking about?"" Malachi's hands laced together on the table. Behind him, he could hear someone being unreasonably loud about a screenplay they were writing.

""I'm a father now, Bulwark,"" replied Alfred. ""A healthy, energetic girl. Her name is Prue.""

Malachi sat for a while, chewing on the thought of his mortal enemy being a father and all the strife that would bring their children, when he was suddenly struck with a thought.

""You mean to tell me that's why Zenith City has been quiet? Because you decided to, what, give up villainy after becoming a parent?""

""You ask a lot of unnecessary questions,"" Alfred retorted, placing a spoon in his cup to stir the cappuccino. ""I know you're the superpowered equivalent of a brick wall, but you're still human. You have a brain. You're capable of piecing things together.""

""Just because you have a child now doesn't absolve you of your wrongdoings,"" Malachi shot back. ""You're still responsible for the many crimes you've committed.""

""Of course, Bulwark. That's why we're here. I brought you here to make a proposition. A coffee shop seemed fitting. In a way, it's like a cordial meeting, despite how much we despise each other.""

The gap in conversation was filled by the piercing, loud complaints from someone at the front counter, one that Malachi - who was not online - learned was colloquially referred to as a 'Karen'. His attention was stolen for only a moment before returning to Alfred, who sat quietly, as if waiting for acknowledgment.

""What's the proposition?"" he inquired.

""Take my child,"" Alfred offered.

""Excuse me?""

""You said it yourself, Bulwark. I am responsible for the many crimes I've committed. Even if I wanted a normal life for myself and my daughter, I know it isn't possible; not for me. If you asked me a year ago whether or not I *could* want that, I probably would've laughed in your face before killing you, but sometimes life gives you a new... perspective to consider. When a life is brought into this world by your own efforts, you start to envision new paths to walk. You start to mull over the possibilities. Sometimes, you stop being self-concerned because there's someone else that needs you more.

""Prue is new to this world. She's able to look at it with a blissful naivety that I lost a long time ago, and in that naivety is the ability to grow into someone who can affect change for the better. She has a chance to succeed where I have failed, and so I'm offering her to you. Though I question your intelligence, I can't question your morality. You are a hero, Bulwark, and I'd rather her role model be someone that saves the world, instead of one who would destroy it.""

Malachi pondered the situation for a moment longer than Alfred was comfortable with before responding.

""Where is the mother?"" he asked, leaning back in the chair.

""Dead,"" Alfred flatly answered.

""You kill her?""

""There's more than just me in your rogues' gallery, Bulwark, but you needn't worry. I was capable of some good, after all.""

""If I accept this offer, how do I know it's not a trick? What guarantee do I have that this isn't a ploy to get me to drop my guard?""

""True to your name, I see,"" Alfred smiled. ""Always the paranoid one. Always putting up a shield.""

Malachi's brows lowered. ""As a hero, I have to be cautious.""

""Smart move, but again, you needn't worry. If you accept my offer, the moment Prue is in your hands, I'll be turning myself in. No ploy, no trick, no ulterior motive. Hands up, full surrender. It only makes sense to do so, now that the city finally got the resources to make limiter cuffs, but if you'd rather do this the old-fashioned way, we can fight it out to the death, no holds barred; make a real show of it. I'll make sure your name goes down in history as the man who escaped and broke the Guillotine.""

There was no answer. Malachi's attention to a man who had ordered several boxes of croissants, watching him perform a balancing act on their way out the door. Alfred broke the silence again as he rose from the table, leaving an empty cup on the table as he gathered his coat.

""I'll give you 48 hours to consider. After two days, I'll find you. Remember what I've said, Bulwark.""

Alfred left Malachi at the table, passing through the open doorway of the coffee shop into the chill winter air. As his breath pushed spiral wisps into the wind, he gazed upward at the looming skyscrapers that bared their towering presences down over the world, like gods erected into being by man. He reached into his vest pocket and pulled a small pocket watch from within, flipping open the lid to check the time. On the inside of the lid was taped a portion of a picture, depicting himself and a newborn child. In the picture, he smiled. It was a new thing for him. Though it looked awkward, somewhere deep down, he could feel the genuine happiness.

Snapping shut the locket, Alfred turned to the bustling streets of Zenith City, slipped on his coat and, with 48 hours left of his normal life, disappeared into the crowd, intent on returning home one last time.

After an underwhelming and frankly, not relaxing, mini moon at the Ritz in Aruba (stifling hot and too many young kids), I did some research to try to find a more relaxing and tranquil destination for our last big trip before becoming a family of three. That was when I discovered the chubby travel Reddit thread and reached out to the TA/mod, Alex. I told her what I was looking for: a place that was quiet, relaxing, and easy to get to from NYC. 

My husband I are both avid scuba divers and all of our trips up until my pregnancy were focused around diving, so a place with good snorkeling would have been a plus for me. Alex immediately offered some feedback, which I greatly appreciated since it helped me narrow my choices down. I decided to give up on a good snorkeling location in lieu of an easy flight and my search for peace and quiet. My final three choices were between Virgin Gorda, Nevis, and Anguilla.

My husband and I ended up choosing to spend 12 nights in Anguilla: 5 nights at Cap Juluca and 7 nights at Malliouhana to stay within our budget. We ended up not picking the Four Seasons since Alex said it’s more family oriented than the other two resorts. I am so grateful to Alex for her expert opinion in this regard because we wouldn’t have known this otherwise. Booking with Alex was so swift and easy. This is 100% the way to go and we’ll definitely be booking through her for future (family!) trips. 

We took a direct flight into Sint Maarten from NYC and I had emailed the hotel concierges at both hotels in advance to organize ground and boat transportation to Anguilla. We went through immigration twice: once in Sint Maarten and once again after getting to Blowing Point Ferry Terminal in Anguilla. The 25 minute shared boat ride was smooth and not choppy at all ($120 pp). I’m prone to seasickness, but felt totally fine after picking a spot at the front of the boat and gazing out at the coastline. The workers at the ferry terminal who handle the luggage from the boat were uncomfortably aggressive about asking for tips, so make sure you have some small bills with you (everyone takes USD). Our car ride took about 10 minutes to get to the resort. The short taxi ride was $30 and we ended up paying $40 including tip. 

After a long day of traveling, luckily the check in process at Cap Juluca was speedy quick and relaxing, with the sound of lapping waves in the background and the beach just a stone throw away. The wonderfully scented cold towel and welcome drink was so refreshing after the hot taxi ride. Alex was able to get our room upgraded from a deluxe beachfront room to the next room category and also left us a sweet note in our room and some yummy treats! 

The room was absolutely gorgeous and you could be on the beach in fifteen seconds. It was a nice change of pace to have designated beach chairs for each room. No morning chair games at this place! It was honestly a world of difference from the Ritz in Aruba where the first three rows of beach chairs were “reserved” by guests all before 7:30 am (even though they wouldn’t show up at their chairs for HOURS). And everyone at CJ seemed to be on the same page about maintaining the tranquil aspect of the resort. No one was taking phone calls on the beach or having loud conversations with other people. Beach service was spotty but we didn’t really need anything other than the cooler full of ice cold boxed waters right between our chairs. We saw our villa host more than we saw a beach attendant. 

CJ sits on Maunday’s Bay and is fantastic for swimming! Swimming from one end to the other took a good 30 minutes for me. Great cardio for the day. Make sure to pack goggles if you’re a swimmer! I had brought my snorkeling mask, but there are no coral reefs in Maunday’s Bay. Just a white sandy bottom. Highly recommend walking along the shoreline from the Cap Shack after a swim and picking out seashells! There were beautiful, fully intact shells of all shapes, sizes, and colors. 

There are so many moments in which you feel like you’re the only person on the beach or in the water. There was one day that it started pouring rain for a part of the afternoon. I figured that I was wet anyway so I took out a blue floaty raft and just floated in the ocean all by myself with the rain pattering away. It was so peaceful. 

The ocean temp was 83-85 degrees according to my Apple Watch and felt so refreshing. I woke up at 6:30 am one morning and watched the sunrise. I was the only person on the entire beach and decided to go for an impromptu swim. In between laps, I’d float on my back in the ocean and just listen to the waves and the tinkling sound of seashells washing up on the shore. I’ll never forget that sound and how at peace I felt in that water. It was only around 7:30 am that I started spotting one or two other people coming onto the beach. Probably my favorite moment at CJ. 

If you like to work out, CJ has the nicest gym I’ve ever seen at a resort. Plenty of benches, top notch machines, woodway equivalent treadmills, a stairmaster, a Pilates reformer, kettlebells, free weights galore (in kg, of course), and plenty of space to stretch out. There’s water and cold towels provided. I felt like I was in my own private Equinox. 

There’s also complimentary “fishing with Shawn” on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 7 am down by the rocks at the Events Pavilion located at the end of the resort past Pimm’s. I went on a Friday morning and really enjoyed the experience. Shawn is a fun guy to talk to and provides all the equipment, from bait to rods. I hadn’t been fishing in a couple years and he was so patient and showed me the ropes again. Someone caught a little fish and a baby sting ray! Shawn baits your line for you and also helps release the fish back into the ocean. 

Even though we had a villa host who I was in contact with via text message, I was really grateful to have Alex in our corner advocating for us when we had a problem with our room. On our third day we were there, it had rained heavily for part of the day, and we discovered that one of the windows was leaking and had created a large puddle in our room. There was also a leak in our bathroom ceiling that leaked into the tub. The biggest issue, however, was that the bathtub was unusable due to silt/soil and yellowish water coming out of the faucet, despite running the water for some time. I had let our villa host know of these issues, but it made me feel so much better to know that Alex had direct contact with management to get our issue sorted right away. We ended up getting moved to another room the next afternoon. 

The new room (1503) ended up being a massive one bedroom suite further along the beach, but most importantly, I finally got my bath! The room category also came with a golf cart, which was handy for driving to breakfast at Cips every morning. While in our previous room (401), we’d just walk along the beach or ride the bikes that were scattered around the property. Our first room was the perfect location to reach everything, from water sports to breakfast. 

Alex also informed us shortly after that she was able to secure a room upgrade for us for our stay at Malliouhana. We had originally booked a basic garden view room and she got us an ocean view premium room. Thanks again, Alex!!! 

The included breakfasts at CJ were spectacular! You can order a la carte from their breakfast menu and also go pick from their buffet. There was always a lot of fresh fruit and pastries. My husband would order the French toast and I got the “acai bowl” (it’s actually a bowl of yogurt with granola and fruit, but nonetheless still yummy) and a made to order egg white omelette. 

With the exception of our first night when we went to Pimm’s, all of our dinners were off site. Veya, Sharkys, and Tastys POV were fantastic. We went to Roy’s Beachside Grill for dinner one night, and while the food was so-so, their Tuesday night trivia was a ton of fun. 

We decided to get a rental car, since it ended up being cheaper than daily back and forth taxi rides.  Colorful Moke rentals are the thing to get in Anguilla, but I am so happy we decided to go for a Toyota Corolla, since it rained one night and you’d get soaked in an open air Moke. My husband had also needed the car to drive to Scuba Shack in Sandy Ground for scuba diving. The rental agent will leave your car in the Cips parking lot and get you set up with a temporary Anguilla drivers license for $20. Very seamless experience. We were able to park our car right outside our villa! Driving in Anguilla is also super easy, with one lane roads and a 30 km speed limit everywhere. Just remember to drive on the left side! 

For part two of our trip, we drove ourselves to Malliouhana and ended up exploring the island for 3 hours after checking out of CJ at 12 pm. Navigating was easy, just make sure you download an offline map of Anguilla on Google maps, and you’re set. We drove to Shoal bay, Crocus bay, Sandy Ground, and then stopped by Best Buy West. The grocery store is worth a visit just to marvel at how exorbitantly expensive everything is there. (And we’re used to Manhattan prices!) Half of the roads were unpaved and quite rocky, and I got a little nervous being in a sedan, but we just went slow and were fine. Our last stop before heading to Malliouhana was at the Anguilla Arch. So worth a visit! We were the only people there and you can drive all the way up to the viewing point. There’s even a path to get to the top to the arch.

We drove to Malliouhana after that and were able to leave the rental car with them. Even upon entry, Malli is a totally different vibe. It’s located on a cliff and you’re immediately greeted by a nice seaside breeze, and a beautiful ocean vista. Check in was also quick and easy, and we were able to enjoy a cold welcome drink while receiving a quick tour of the property. 

Our room (10) was in the main house and up a set of stairs. The room was beautiful and had a giant balcony with a sweeping oceanfront view. The decor and colors at Malli are so Caribbean chic with contrasting blues and yellows. There was another cute note and treats waiting for us from Alex! A bottle of wine, a yummy dessert, a cute dolphin plush, and an adorable onesie for our baby girl! Housekeeping also left a nice note and “happy babymoon” decoration on the bed. It was a perfect start to part two of our vacation. 

So it seems like Malli is a very popular place to have a destination wedding. Our first night was on a Friday and there was a wedding welcome party happening at the resort that night, with the wedding reception the next day. It’s such a small resort (only 63 rooms), that it seemed like the majority of hotel guests were there for the wedding. Our ocean view room in the main house happened to be right above the hotel bar, and next to the pool. The music and din from the welcome party didn’t bother us until people moved to the hotel bar. The sound proofing of the balcony doors wasn’t the best. There was a live musician playing and while that would’ve been kind of enjoyable on its own, the drunk wedding guests’ off tune singing and cheering became extremely grating after a few hours. Especially around 10:30 pm when I was trying to sleep. I even tried putting in ear plugs, but could still hear them. It felt like we were at a cheap all inclusive in Cancun as opposed to a luxe boutique hotel. I maybe could’ve put up with one night of it, but the thought of this just being the welcome party and that the real wedding was the following night, was just too much for me to handle. 

I ended up calling reception and asked when the music would stop and just explained that I was six months pregnant and also a light sleeper to boot. The lady at the front desk was so kind and understanding. She called me back after about ten minutes and offered to move us to another room that was further away from the main house. When she showed me the room, and all I could hear were the sound of crashing waves as opposed to cacophonous Adele karaoke, I could’ve cried from happiness. The new room ended up being yet another upgrade for us. It was right over turtle bay beach and felt so private and peaceful. On the night of the wedding, there was only one incident in which one drunk lady was yelling someone’s name right outside our door at around midnight. Besides that one time, it was peace and quiet all night, every night. 

The staff went above and beyond and sent us a drip coffee machine for us to use in our room, which my husband really appreciated because he likes to sleep in and also drinks 3 cups of coffee in the morning. The nespresso machine in the room just wasn’t going to cut it and the morning coffee in the lobby was only available until around 10 am. 

On Sunday, it seemed like most of the wedding guests left. The hotel was so serene and quiet. It felt like there were more staff than hotel guests. We had lunch at Bar Soleil most days and enjoyed the breeze and sound of the waves. 

The live band, Vere Musiq, that performs every Sunday from 6-8 pm at Leon’s was incredible!! They had a full band and performed original music. Everyone was vibing and Leon’s Sunday Funday seemed to draw in a lot of locals as well. We loved the food at Leon’s and ate there multiple times (best conch fritters that we had while in Anguilla).

Since Malli is on a cliff, there’s way more walking required here. With the two beaches being on opposite sides of the resort, you need to take stairs down to access both. There is no beach service or even chairs at turtle bay beach, but it’s the perfect place for a private swim and to view the sunset. The other beach on Meads Bay has beach loungers and is fully serviced. The bucket of ice waters that magically appeared next to me while on the beach was much appreciated. I think the beach attendant at Malli came around more than they did at CJ. 

I’m not sure if it was due to the time of year we went, but the waves were rough in Meads Bay, with there being a steep drop off within a few feet of getting into the water. My favorite spot at Malli was either on our balcony or at turtle bay beach. The little beach has no shade, so I waited until after 4 pm to go swimming there. I just grabbed a towel from the pool, packed the gorgeous Malli beach bag with water, bug spray, sunscreen, and my snorkel, and walked down the twenty or so steps to my own private beach. I got to see two rainbows in one day from the beach. One was during sunset and it was an absolutely magical moment getting to see a rainbow on my right and the sunset on my left, all while floating in the ocean. I was actually shocked by how good the snorkeling was from turtle bay beach. I swam to the Malli Bluff and saw four free swimming stingrays, a bunch of lobsters hiding in the rocks, and soo many tropical fish. Not the easiest swim though, with a significant surge and rough waves. I wanted to go out further but there’s so much boat traffic going by Malli, that I didn’t want to risk going too far out from the beach or rocks. 

I think you could request a golf cart to bring you down to Meads Bay, but we always walked down there ourselves. After the steps to get down to the beach from the resort, there’s a rocky part that you have to walk over to get to the main part of the beach/Leons (their beach restaurant). Malli is definitely not the right place for people with mobility issues.  

The food at Malli and around Meads Bay was noticeably better than at CJ. The concierge made all the reservations for us and we had dinner at Malli’s beach restaurant, Leon’s (no res required), Straw Hat, Jacala, and Ocean Echo (all SO GOOD). Malli is at one end of the bay and Four Seasons is on the other end, with all the restaurants scattered in between on the beach. The walk to Ocean Echo from our room took us about 30 minutes. 

Meads Bay Beach is eroding away and pretty steep, so it wasn’t the easiest to walk on, but walking to dinner and back while stargazing was an adventure in itself. The beach is so quiet and dark that we had to use our phone flashlights to guide us there and back.

We went to view the sunset and got some drinks at the Sunset Lounge at FS one night. It’s a beautiful, sprawling resort that reminded me of the Miami Edition hotel. Very sleek and modern. It definitely had way more young kids and families here than at the other two hotels. I made a mental note to stay here next time with family, but for the purpose of our babymoon, I was so happy with our hotel picks for this trip. 

Of note, Anguilla is a tropical island and is therefore extremely buggy. Bring bug spray with deet! I am a certified mosquito magnet and needed to be constantly sprayed down from head to toe prior to venturing outside and after getting out of the water. There were a few times I forgot to be vigilant about the bug spray, and I paid for it dearly in the form of giant, itchy welts. My husband, on the other hand, never sprayed and never got bit. One of life’s mysteries, I suppose, but nevertheless infuriating. CJ provided bug spray in the hotel room and Malli had bug spray by the pool. 

Both hotels had nightly turndown service and left small treats in the room. Malli’s nighttime treats had CJ’s beat, and ranged from a sugar scrub to rum cakes to fresh aloe, with a little note explaining what each thing was. I loved that housekeeping at both places provided pregnancy pillows upon request. The concierges were extremely helpful with making dinner reservations and arranging car rentals for us, providing us with a printed itinerary for the week ahead. Something I wish Malli had more of was access to fresh fruit. The only time they had fruit and a smoothie available to order was during breakfast at Celeste’s. 

All in all, Anguilla was truly the perfect place for our babymoon and exactly what we both needed to recharge and reconnect. I think it’s now my favorite Caribbean island :) we heard from a local that we went fishing with that there’s going to be a cruise port opening up in Anguilla in the future. Not sure when that will be completed, but it’ll definitely change the culture of the island when it becomes a cruise ship destination. I’m glad we got to experience it before that happens. 

TLDR: Cap Juluca and Malliouhana in Anguilla are the perfect babymoon resorts if you are looking for a relaxing, luxe, and tranquil getaway.

1. Go to bed at the same hour every single day, making sure you get 7-8 hours of sleep
2. Turn off any screens at least one hour before going to bed
3. Take 15-30 minutes to relax with a good book, journaling, deep breathing, or simple stretching exercises
4. Invest in healthy ""sleepware,"" comfy mattresses and pillows
5. Prepare your bedroom for sleep, use essential oils, dim the lights
6. Avoid eating at least two hours before bed
7. Limit coffee and smoking after sunset

Remember, adopting two or three habits and sticking to them for years is healthier than adopting all of them for a short period of time.

I’m 34M from Britain (England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 


If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect.

1h3jdwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteStreakEN/comments/1h3jdwg/streak_12/,Streak 12.,"Hello!

Today I want to share with you my thoughts about frugality as lifestyle.

There is lifestyle trend about frugality. Frugal people minimise their spending to get more freedom and control of their life. Rules are simple. If you spend less, you need to work less on job you don't like or work at a job that is your passion no matter what the salary and you have time to live. So, these people buy only necessary things with best cost/value. Life of such people is simple, but happy. I admire their willpower, very hard to resist modern marketing in times of consumerism.

But as for me I prefer healthy balance. Sometimes you need to award yourself and I can't deny material things also bring pleasure. Last purchase that I especially liked was rather expensive coffee machine. I like it so much, never regretted the money spend.

Have a good day, dear reader.",1,1732992586.0,WriteStreakEN,1,1.0,False

Recently met this friend of a friend (26M) at an event, and he asked me to get coffee with him. 

It was a good time and we actually had a great convo! He paid (and said I could pay next times) and then also texted me after that he had a good time and we should do it again……


While hanging, we also had a conversation come up about relationships and that whole area of life. 


It wasn’t ever established if this is romantic or not….and the overthinker I am….i don’t know if I’m just totally overthinking it.

he does send little memer or videos on insta or lets ne know about new refords by ny fave artists but it was kinda telling that he didnt try to create and in person things just to meet.

he has been kind and helpful to me and more attentive than my own family or long term acquaintances (but, this seems to be the case when a person is naturally attentive to others who are treating them ok). it took long and today after ruminating and talking to chatgpt endlessly and being kinda frustrated with the ambiguity i asked him if we can meet in a cafe (i have some things that i can give him either when we meet for a work project in a few weeks or i can give them to him sooner in a cafe-some items from a foreign shop we both buy from online and since i traveled today i picked his items for him). his answer was a no, and it was not even covered or sugarcoated (like he would make up excuses or say hes busy). 

which is kinda useful because no more rumination-no false hope, no endless what ifs and no overtinking. i knew he wasnt loving me like i loved him but thought he might be into me a bit (haha). 

ha.ha. if he doesnt even want to meet for a coffee (there is no real reason not to, we live in a city chock full of cafes and quite near to each other) and there isnt a reason given, well it is quite clear. no reason to ruminate no doubts no hope.

i will live my life as before and i am used to things like that, but its clarity surprised me. maybe he senses the urgent energy and kinda decided it was time to be clear",9,1732992499.0,ForeverAloneWomen,4,1.0,False

\-Comfort  
Both are so comfy, like really comfy, QC Ultra have a more spacious inside of the ear cups so your ears will be more ""free"", but the XM4 have this feeling when your ear touch the ""fabric"" that feels so niceeeee, I do prefer Bose here tbh, I feel better, but this will depend on every person tho.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra (Subjective)

\-Battery Life  
Bose do fall behind a little when it comes to battery, they have a 24h battery life and a 18h battery when Immersive Audio ON, rememer you cant turn off ANC on the Ultra so you wont get the battery life any better than 24h.  
While the XM4 have a 30h battery life while ANC ON, thats pretty good, and If I remember well they have a 38h battery when ANC OFF, even better, but tbh yall going to use ANC in the XM4, thats why you are buying them in the first place probably.

Winner : Sony WH-1000XM4

\-ANC  
I did some testings on my speakers featuring with Plane Engine Ambient Noice / Coffee Shop Ambient Noice / Office Ambient Noice and heres what I got.  
  
On the plane test I was a little surprised tbh, It is said the ANC on the XM4 its better when it comes to low frecuencies, while the XM4 cancelled probably a 85%-90% of the noice, the QC Ultra cancelled all of it (100%), like, all of it, I couldnt hear a sh\*\*, while on the XM4 I could, but like a pretty low low amount of the engine sound, now when on a real plane idk if things change, I havent got a chance to prove both there, probably it changes because Sony Atmospheric Pression thing or smth like that, but as far as low rumbling noises here on the floor, QC Ultra do a better job.

On the Coffee Shop simulation, things got way closer, in the XM4, the ambient voices sound, you know, the tumult of all the voices you hear was cancelled like 85% while in the QC Ultra it was cancelled 90% probably, It was better on Ultra but by a very small difference, but both let in sudden and high frecuencies like cup, but they muffle them quite well tbh, Its very very close, but QC Ultra win by half of a step.

On the Office Simulation was quite the same, both of the cancelled 90% of the back noices, but I noticed the QC Ultra cancelled the main voice you could hear on the audio more than the XM4, not by much, but they did a better job, QC Ultra win here, not by too little and not by far.

Yall need to remember XM4 were released on 2020 and QC Ultra were released on 2023, 3 years difference and the XM4 keep up pretty good tbh.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

\-Sound Impressions  
Okay, here its mainly about how YOU like to hear your music, but this is what I felt with both of these when its about sound.  
Bose have a noticeably flatter respond compared to the XM4, though they arent flat, they do have an emphazised low frecuencies sound, but not as much as the XM4, in the XM4 you could feel the Bass, you could really hear and feel their deep and strong bass, while in the Bose you wont feel it, you will hear it, but its more tight and ""weak"" you could say.  
Something I also noticed, is that Mids were clearer on Bose, hearing different Artists and songs I could tell the QC Ultra did a better job making that clear voices, while the XM4 seemed a little bit muffled? they did sound good tbh, but I liked the vocies on the Bose better, they feel more present and clear. In highs frecuencies is pretty much the same thing, I couldnt really feel a change, maybe Bose was more present, but nothing far.

In general I do like the XM4 sound more, I like to feel my bass in my music, but also have a good and clear mids and highs, I feel that XM4 fail there a little bit, but I liked Sony sound in general more than Bose, tho in some cases for chiller music with less bass I do prefer the Bose, they sound more clear and you still will have some bass, but I listen to Rock and Hip-Hop a lot, so XM4 will fit more for me in most of cases.

Winner : WH-1000XM4 (Subjective)

\-Aware / Ambient Mode  
Bose Ambient mode Is pretty damn good tbh, not at Apple level but its pretty natural and clear, definitely better than XM4, XM4 ambient mode its kinda muffled and robotic, definitely better on Bose, no question.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

\-Mic Quality  
Again, Bose microphone is better than XM4, they did a better job when it comes to the microphone on the XM5, but the XM4 arent as good as QC Ultra, though XM5 have better mic than Ultras on noisy / windy conditions, we are comparing them to the XM4, not the XM5, so Bose takes the win here.

Winner : Bose QC Ultra

Bose QC Ultra is better over-all comapring them to the WH-1000XM4, though XM4 arent bad at all, somethings like Comfort and Sound are subjective, I do prefer Sony sound in some cases, but ANC and Aware mode on Bose is quite superior, tho if you have the XM4 or QC Ultra it isnt NECESSARY to buy the other, tho If you want a different experience overall you should buy them.

Thats my opinion remember! I might get the XM5 in a future tho, I will come back then and do a comparative of the XM4, XM5, QC Ultra and Momentum 4 :)",5,1732992160.0,SonyHeadphones,3,0.86,False

\-Comfort  
Both are so comfy, like really comfy, QC Ultra have a more spacious inside of the ear cups so your ears will be more ""free"", but the XM4 have this feeling when your ear touch the ""fabric"" that feels so niceeeee, I do prefer Bose here tbh, I feel better, but this will depend on every person tho.

Or is my wife making me walk on pins and needles?,"Yesterday, my stepdaughter, who is 9, promised that she would take the trash out the next morning before she went on errands with her mom.

This morning, I told my wife what she had told me: “She promised to take the trash out this morning before you and she went on errands.”

My wife responded with, “Why didn’t you tell me yesterday? I am waking her up at 8am, we have a bus at 9:30, and I have to do x, y, and x. Now I can’t do any of these things because my plans are derailed since you're demanding she takes out the trash.”

I told her it would take five minutes to take the trash out and that they could do it as they left. She explained that it would take 15 minutes, actually, because her daughter would fight with her about it, and she would take a long time to collect all the trash.

I reinforced to her that my stepdaughter promised to take out the garbage and that we agreed to hold her accountable to do her chores so that she learns to be responsible and to keep her promises. My wife then got angry and stopped making her coffee, saying that she didn’t even have time to make coffee now.

This turned into a huge fight.

Later, I told her I would really appreciate it if she wouldn’t get so upset and impatient with me so suddenly as she did, and I expressed that I need her to try to be nicer and gentler when she speaks to me. For example, maybe she could have said, “Hey, we don’t have a lot of time this morning, and I’m pretty busy. I will make sure she takes the trash out when we get home.” This would’ve been much nicer and respectful than her getting so upset and being so impatient with me.

Honestly, the way she talked to me this morning is the way that she talks to me much of the time, and I feel really frustrated by this. I expressed this feeling to her, and she said, “I have no rights to be a human and get upset about things I don’t like” and called me controlling.

Further, my stepdaughter talks to everyone the way that my wife talks to me today. She copies her mom‘s behavior and is often very impatient with everyone.

I’m just asking her to be nicer. And I also do expect that we hold my stepdaughter accountable to keeping her promises. We have agreed that she should do chores when she gets home from school before any entertainment — no screens before chores are done. And we have communicated this expectation to her. It has happened many times that I have come home to my wife busy doing something with my stepdaughter having a screen in her hands, and no chores have been done. No enforcement of rules.

We met online, hit it off, exchanged numbers, and met for a coffee date days later. It was easily the best first date I’ve ever had, and she agreed it ranked in the top for her. We were in agreement to take things slow and casual, i was newly single after 15 years, and she had some bad relationships.  I however caught feelings.  She is as close to perfect in what I’m looking for in a partner that I’ve ever found.  I respected taking it slow, she’s a very busy person, and i didn’t want to become one of her dating horror stories.  Things were going well, we were having a great time when we were together, texted as much as our schedules allowed.  But at around 2 months i felt a shift of her backing off a little and maybe not feeling it as much as i was.   We continued seeing each other and we enjoyed our time together, but it was becoming less.  At the beginning of this month she told me that due to stress and the amount she is working(50+ hrs/wk), her kids schedules, and just taking care of herself, that she doesn’t have time to focus on dating.   I believe that is true, but i also believe she just wasn’t feeling it, and was trying to spare my feelings.  I told her i understand, i told her how i felt about her, and that if she ever wanted to give dating a try with me again to let me know.  She replied with some nice words, but i felt like this was going to be the last text she’d be sending.  Not going to lie, it hurt a bit.  She wasn’t the first woman I dated since becoming single, but the only one I really saw something in.  I have stopped myself from texting her several times, not about giving me another chance, just about things she would like, or laugh at.

Thursday she texted to say Happy Thanksgiving. Part of me didn’t want to reply, but I did, since there are still feelings.  We shared a few texts, and i didn’t take it as she was interested in starting anything again.   Unfortunately these texts have her back in my head, and I’m sad again. I was fine with never hearing from her again.  

My question.  Should i tell her that i still have feelings, and that she shouldn’t text me again unless she is interested in trying to date again?  Or should i just leave it as it is and hope that if she ever texts me again that I’m over these feelings? ",0,1732991903.0,datingoverforty,7,0.5,False

Would this be good enough?

The long story: My girlfriend was a barista for years and really enjoyed the job, and has always had this dream of having a little coffee cart where we could sell cheap coffee once or twice a week. The idea being that the cart doesn’t necessarily make money and we’d fund it with our actual jobs, but it would be a fun way to do something nice and engage with the community, plus she just enjoys making coffee.

I know basically nothing about making coffee, but from what I gather a machine like this is a good option that can make a few cups of coffee at a time, is simple to service, and will last a very long time: https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/collections/rancilio/products/rancilio-silvia-espresso-machine?_pos=4&_fid=0c7ba40e5&_ss=c

From what I can think of, the most important things would be the longevity of the machine and its ability to continuously make coffee for at least a handful of hours, but is it maybe too small for this purpose?

What do you all think? I am hoping to make it a Christmas gift as sort of a first-step towards her mini cart dream, but I want to make sure I am not buying something that won’t work very well.

I've been on Cobenfy for 3 ish weeks now and well...first things first: When I ran out the pharmacy needed a pre-auth so that took a couple of days. Then they had to order it. THEN it got lost in shipping. Then they had to order it again. All in all I was out last Thursday morning until Monday night. As with many meds detoxing is hard especially when it's so sudden. But I've been back on it and honestly...? I'm doing pretty spectacular except that I'm TIRED. Like waking up at 8AM and wanting to take a nap at 11AM tired. Coffee/tea/energy drinks help for maybe an hour. As I said in my first post you have to (at least for me) take it on an empty stomach. The blurry vision is REAL when I take it with food in my stomach. Positive symptoms (almost) never heard of them! I don't experience that many negative symptoms except for lack of motivation and I'm still struggling with that. But mostly because I'm SO TIRED. Since getting on medication I'm very much an animated person in general yet at the same time I've very quiet. However when I do talk I talk a lot. Does that make any sense at all? I can't tell much how Cobenfy contributes to that or not. Overall, I can say that I'm doing so much better compared to my old antipsychotics. 

  
Another positive/interesting predicament that I've fallen into is how much I am not hungry. On every other antipsychotic I binge eat whereas this one, yeah I need breakfast, but other than that I really don't get hungry throughout the day. I basically have to force myself to eat lunch and/or dinner just because I still feel full from breakfast. I know I have to eat another meal during the day because I'll get nauseous if I don't. It just sucks because my brain is still in that binge eating mindset. My brain tells me to eat constantly, but my stomach tells me to STOP. It's just a situation that I'm not used to at all. 

  
Tl;dr Cobenfy has been working wonders for my positive symptoms. It's just the drowsiness side effect that makes everything suck. I reached out to my psych and I'm waiting to hear what they say about that. 

Best wishes to all of you and especially those who are on this wild Cobenfy ride too!

I’m going to preface this by saying I am 30 weeks pregnant with my second child, I have a two year-old toddler, I have been with the cold since this past Sunday. My SIL is severely depressed, in the midst of an impending divorce and in a very stressful job. 

On Tuesday, my stepson celebrated his birthday. I asked family members to come over to celebrate. I made chicken Parmesan and cake. All my in-laws family came, including my sister-in-law with her two twin girls (3 yo), mil, and my BIL with his girlfriend and one year old. We had a nice day. My stepson felt loved and special. Which was my whole point! Being a teenager is tough these days. AnyWho

I’m trucking along still sick, Wednesday night I had to work. My sister-in-law asked if we could watch her girls because she wanted to go out with her friends to catch up and have a drink. My husband was on board! As he was the one taking care of the kids because I would be at work. The night went well, except for bedtime, these girls are used to having their mother fall asleep with them. And it was a complete meltdown with tears and screaming and door banging because Mom wasn’t home to put them in bed. my husband texted her and let her know that the girls are having a hard time, she came home about an hour and a half later the girls are already asleep by then. Then she goes on to tell us that she went out on a date. OK cool. I don’t know why you didn’t just say that the first place but all right. Doesn’t make a difference.

Next day is Thanksgiving, we wake up bright and early feed the kids, start ramping up Thanksgiving prep. All the while my sister-in-law Sister on the couch sleeping in and out. We’re pretty much taking care of the girls again, although they’re playing altogether and keeping each other company, which is fine.

She goes on to say that she’s going over a friends house for a bit and offered to take our daughter so we can get some stuff done withou kids in the house. I was very appreciative of that and let her take her, we said we were gonna have dinner at 4 PM. And ask everyone in the family to bring a dish to make it a little bit easier. She had not started her dish at all, but said that she would be here in an hour.
She comes back, and then says she has an appointment, and just drops off the kids . Says She’ll be back in a couple of hours.
She comes back around 245 and shares that she saw this guy again. At this point, I’m a little annoyed, but I don’t say anything because it’s really not my place to say. But I don’t think it was the right time. I digress, she starts cooking her dishes , the rest of the family shows up. Everything is going good, normal chaos with three children under three and Thanksgiving in full force. 

Thanksgiving comes and goes. Any chance my sister-in-law gets throughout the day. She just lays on the couch and sleeps . either my mother-in-law is chasing after the kids watching the kids, I am or my husband is. She does this a lot, my MIL is a live in nanny pretty much. Since SIL works full-time, MIL takes care of the kids all day. And then some because like I said, my sister-in-law severely depressed and spends most of her time sleeping.

It’s nighttime, I put my daughter down in her bed to sleep. She falls asleep and she goes in with her girls to go to sleep.  The next day comes and she offers to stay up with the girls in the morning time, but says l I’ll just be on the couch laying down. For me that’s not really watching kids. My daughter wakes up hungry she likes breakfast so I just wake up and start my routine. I make the kids breakfast. I make coffee. I start cleaning up a bit. 
The morning time was rough because my husband and I got in a tiff about him being hungover. He goes to work, I’m annoyed he’s annoyed. I shower and get dressed, have a little emotional breakdown in the shower because of the fatigue and just overall ready to rest but I can’t. I’m doing all this while she is just laying there sleeping on the couch, kids are starting to get annoyed with each other fighting over toys being rough.. By this time around noon, I ask if I can take an hour break to go run an errand. But really I just go hit the thrift store which is my kind of therapy.

I cry a little bit more in my car and then come home within 45 minutes. I come in feeling a bit better, make a left over plate for myself and my  daughter, it’s almost nap time for us . She says she’s going to take a nap with the girls then head out . But really she’s just still on the couch on her phone while the kids are running around. I’m trying to get my daughter down but with the distractions of the house it’s hard too. She keeps telling the girls to take a nap now but they’re not listening because let’s be real. They really don’t. At this point, I’m just laying there contemplating how I’m gonna tell her to respectfully leave. I finally get the courage to say, “this is coming straight from the heart and I don’t mean anything bad by this, but I really need some alone time, I’m feeling overly tired. And I don’t have much left in me, I just need some quiet and space.” 

She goes on to say I totally understand starts railing up the girls getting them in the car and getting her stuff together. I keep on saying that I’m so sorry and I appreciate her so much for understanding, I just have a limit and I hit it. She tells me “ I totally understand. Sometimes I love being by myself “. Makes it seem like it’s totally fine and she took it well. Come to find out a few hours later my husband‘s mad at me because apparently I offended my SIL. He tells me that I’m creating a riff in the family and I don’t even know it? Going on about how I have no empathy or anything.   I just felt so blind sighted and hurt. Like I know she’s having a hard time, and I tried to be as neutral and nice about this whole situation without trying to offend anybody. I am very well aware that she’s fragile right now. But do I have to walk on eggshells and let my mental healthy client for the sake of her?

It was so hard for me to muster up the courage to establish a boundary. And I thought I did all the right things but apparently I just can’t win. So AITAH for asking my sister-in-law to leave? ",6,1732991421.0,AITAH,4,0.88,False

Discover the Eternal Horizon of Vintage Vogue - A Renaissance of Retro Chic Awaits!"" 🏴‍☠️✨","Ahoy, treasure hunters of trend and vintage swashbucklers! Raise the sails; we're embarking on a stylistic voy-age back in time! 🏴‍☠️

Step inside your fashion time machine (also known as your grandma's closet or the local thrift store) and set the dials to ""Retro Roleplay!"" It's time to discuss a trend that's spinning around faster than the records in a 70’s disco - the undying resurgence of vintage styles in modern fashion. This isn't just a fad, my friends; it's a full-blown renaissance, and I’ve got your exclusive, all-access pass.

- **Flared Troubadours! 🕺🌼**
Behold the triumphant return of flared trousers and bell-bottom jeans! Once the uniform of disco die-hards and rock-n-roll devotees, these hip-huggers are back with a vengeance. And if you think they look groovy now, just imagine how stellar they'll pair with your smartphone and wireless headphones.

- **Polka Dots & Petticoats! 🎀⏳**
As iconic as Marilyn Monroe over that subway grate, the polka dots and full skirts of the ‘50s are waltzing back onto the runway. Our mothers were onto something, eh? Toss in cinched waists and pressed collars, and you've got yourself a look that's both classic and classy. Glass of iced tea, anyone?

- **Leather Weathers the Ages💼**
The leather jacket, much like the immortal vampire, never truly goes out of style. Sixties rebels, eighties rockers, nineties grunge kids, and even today’s Insta influencers – all draped in the everlasting cool of leather. Always edgy, now it's donned with a splash of sustainability - who says you can't haunt the earth responsibly?

- **Back To the Twee-tier 🎩📚**
Calling all quirky indie kids and BookTok bibliophiles! Tweed, corduroy, and those adorable sweater vests that scream ""intellectual, but approachable"" are worming their way back into today's coffee shops and virtual classrooms. Strut the halls owning every bit of that professor chic. 

Why is vintage the voluminous, pleated skirt swishing across the stage of present-day style? Simple: the past is an unchartered sea brimming with forgotten treasures, each wave bringing a new old chunk of gold to the sands of contemporary culture. It's circular; a fashion ouroboros forever feeding off its tales of yore while stretching them, ever so chicly, into tomorrow.

To finish, sing it with me: Vintage is victory, sailors! It turns heads instead of stomachs and strums the heartstrings of nostalgia while keeping threads out of landfills. So batten down your bother about 'outdated' and hoist your personal standards to new heights! 

Vive le vintage, me hearties! And remember, style's about making it yours, so why not pluck a page from the grand annals of fashion history and rewrite it? Drop anchor in the comments with your prized vintage find or the timeless trend you're resurrecting – this captain looks forward to seeing all your old-school spoils! 🏴‍☠️✨",1,1732991001.0,FashionFuture,0,1.0,False

THE UNITED BEANS CAFE AND RESTRO

ORDER: Pink sauce pasta 279Rs, Hot chicken garlic 299Rs 

Drinks: Tiramisu frappe 199Rs, blue berry mocha frappe 169Rs

1. Pink sauce pasta was not cooked properly, taste was okayish. Quantity was little.

2. In pasta, burgers, sandwich and similar items they have veg menu but if you want they will make it in the Non-veg however you will have to pay extra charges for which they have a different page on the menu. 

3. We paid 80Rs for the grilled chicken chunks to add in our pasta but it was not worth it, they only added 4-5 pieces. Maybe it's the price I don't know.

4. Hot chicken garlic (basically chicken Manchurian) it was amazing. Worth the price. Quantity is okay.

5. Tiramisu frappe, was strong and food not your regular thick frappe, it was how it is supposed to be, was great.

6. Blue berry mocha frappe suggest by server, was great. (This is not a coffee blend, it is mocha, blue berry and icecream blend, and not thick) Again, it was how it is supposed to be and was great. 

They have main course as well, however time nai mila try krne ka, but I saw the prices and they are expensive by 10-20rs. They also have a book were you can leave your feedback.

There must have been a time skip in the dream because my next recollection is the following morning. I was drinking coffee at my dining room table and reading a newspaper (def a dream). On the front page, it showed that people had died of exposure in the storm while out shopping. The articles picture was the outside of a Best Buy with Jay frozen dead outside the doors. 

The picture of him frozen wasn't goofy in the slightest. It was tremendously horrific. The dream didn't wake me up but I recalled it this morning while drinking my morning coffee. I had to jump on Google real quick to make sure it wasn't a real event.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I started using the brand new Kingrinder K6 I bought during the black friday offers on Amazon and I'm experiencing some issues right now.

I come from an 1ZPresso JX Pro so I have experience with manual grinders, however I took this K6 out of the box and it was set to 0 according to the dial, and the burrs weren't fully closed and touching as they would on my JX Pro if I go finer until the burrs lock.

The manual says not to go more than -15 clicks past the 0 point and rotating the handle to avoid damaging the burrs, however if I go -10 clicks past 0 the burrs don't touch and light filter through if I observe the inside of the grinder while pointing it to towards a light source, however I didn't dare go finer to avoid messing up because if I tried rotating the burr I could hear some minor resistance.

I went back to ""out of the box"" 0 setting and first to 75 clicks, made a coffee and tried grinding as you can see in the picture at 45 and 25 (25 shoulde be turkish coffee extra fine), but there's little difference and surely enough it's not the grind size it's supposed to be according to the manual.

What's happening here? Is the 0 point the grinder came from factory not the actual 0 point but maybe a full rotation past the true 0 point? Is my grinder defective?

Probably it's just my anxiety but I made a coffee with my Switch at 45 clicks and the coffee in the cup was muddy and not clean and transparent as with my JX Pro, so I'm getting nervous.

I already wrote to Kingrider support, however since it's saturday I don't expect them to answer soon, therefore I'm kindly asking for help here.

Thanks and sorry for my anxiety but lately I've been getting a lot of defective or broken products from Amazon so each time I buy anything I always have to check it under the microscope to be sure it wasn't already returned or damaged by the courier...
