My brother is currently living with me and never learned basic things he’s capable of learning like how to use a washing machine,How to budget money, pay bills, make his bed and eve how to make a cup of tea and coffee as our parents would say it’s to dangerous and that he will burn himself. He has issues with confidence due to constantly being told know and that he’s incapable, it’s to dangerous, ect. 

My brother is living with me as he’s not happy at our parents and wants the independence he can’t have while living with them. Our parents tried to stop him moving out, telling him, how’s he going to afford to live with no money and no job? He gets disability benefits that was paid to my parents, I’ve helped him set things up so he’s now receiving his own money. I’ve also told him to not sign anything our parents want him to sign as they tried to get him to sign a power of attorney form, which thankfully he didn’t and spoke to me before agreeing to sign anything.

He’s diagnosis is moderate intellectual disability, I do wonder if his intellectual disability could be mid and that it looks moderate due to lack of opportunity’s to learn. I think our pa may have deliberately kept him from learning basic life skills due to wanting his benefits and because of how it improves their social image with the look at me, look how good I am. I have such a difficult high care child that I have to make sacrifices for to look after him. They love to brag about how incapable he is and how difficult he is to look after. Most of my brothers acting out is due to frustration of not being able to do things for himself. He had not once acted out since living with me. I’m currently looking into what supports he may be entitled to

1mthxoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breakupadvice/comments/1mthxoi/raitah_am_i_the_ass_hole_for_breaking_up_with_my/,r/AITAH Am I the ass hole for breaking up with my boyfriend after he accused me of ruining his entire life for the umpteenth time Advice Needed,"TL;DR: Boyfriend and I were in a long-distance relationship, I got diagnosed with a potentially cancerous tumor, he quit his job to care for me, and now he's blaming me for his financial struggles and job loss after I broke up with him.

I (19F) met my boyfriend (24M) online,we both are indians and we were in a long-distance relationship. We wanted to settle in Europe so first he moved to in Slovenia after getting a job and after 1½ years later i moved to in Germany for my ausbildung. At my first week in germany, I got diagnosed with a tumor in my hand that could possibly be cancerous. I immediately wanted to break up with him because I didn't want him to feel burdened by my health issues. However, he refused to break up with me and said he wanted to support me(which now he claims is because he thought it was a joke). So as he showed me support and after promissing me he will be there in every step of this journey with me. I asked him if he can come to germany to support me but I didn't forced him he could just say no if didn't wanted to . I might have pushed him a bit to come fast as he can as he promised and said he wanted me in his life and Will always be there. He came to Germany to care for me. I was touched by his gesture, but I felt guilty knowing that he was sacrificing a lot for me.Things have gotten even more complicated. He has some drinking issues, and few times at nights when he was super drunk, he tried to leave Germany and drive back to Slovenia. I stopped him because I was worried about his safety and didn't want him to have an accident. I have cut my wrist due to all the pressure and to stop him going like that after a stupid fight in that much drunk state. This has also lead to something even bad as he started to smoke cigarettes and also blamed on me as if my suicide attempt have give him so much stress and this is why he is currently smoking and he continued smoking all the way to a new addiction even smoked in our room when I have severe nausea due to chemo. He promised means to quit smoking once he get to Slovenia. And I like to believe it. Now, he's blaming me for stopping him and says I shouldn't have cared if he died. He claims I've betrayed him and his family.he had also hit me during this time and fought a lot with me when he was drunk But I forgave it because he was only like this when he drank and the other moments with him was loving and he cared for me like so much even bathed me fed me and hugged me to sleep

Fast forward to when I had to go back to India to continue my treatment as i couldn't bare it alone there with the chemo i needed my parents. He lost his current job and luckily got a new job offer in Germany, and he had to come back to Slovenia to finalize some paperwork when. I thought everything was okay, but after a few months after us trying every he could not get that job he got his visa annuled and came back to India but now he has another job offer in Slovenia but now he's blaming me for ruining his life. He's saying that i have ruined his career and caused him debt. I should have gone back to India immediately without waiting for biopsy results. I'm feeling really guilty and conflicted about the whole situation. I asked him to come to Germany because I needed his support, but I feel like he could have said no. He made those decisions on his own.

He's even bringing my dad into our conversations and  talking bad about him. I'm at a loss for what to do.

Update: Should I finalize the breakup? Despite everything, I still have feelings for him, and I appreciate the help he provided when I was alone in Germany during a really tough time. However, his current behavior is causing me a lot of stress, and I'm not sure if I can handle being in a relationship with someone who blames me like this, especially given his drinking issues.

Update 2: i have completed my treatment and is trying to recover from the side effects i have tried to make things work a lot but feel like I should Stop this relationship because I don't want him to feel burdened by my health issues recently few other problems also rose as he wanted me to convert to Christianity which I have already told I won't at the beginning of the relationship and i have to move back to Germany or Slovenia which I don't think is good with my health issues. I have denied both and told I can't do this we should stop this and just be friends and I'll completely help him return to Slovenia like not financially but dealing with paper work and guidances. We tried it for few days like still kept calling eachother and slept talking at night and few days later patched up again. This happened few times but yesterday he got drunk again and had a fight with his dad and things escalated quickly physically. I was mad about it but haven't fought with him either lectured him until he repeatedly pushed me asking what happened that night then he told me he wanted to stop drinking plead help him i suggested that he see a doctor which he agreed to. Then at evening he pranked me saying he have been custodied by police and send me a video of him searching for something tensed without any explanation i got super worried and stressed and when I called him as usual to sleep he told me this whole thing was a prank. Then I told him I feel tensed and feel like going to hospital to check my pressure and can I go to my mom's room to sleep because it can call me down. But he reacted like then why did you call me I know you are like this you always wants to be sleep with your mom you don't care about me and all. Yes it's partially true because I'm not really comfortable to talk to him these days as I'm too stressed to deal with his drama. I have changed the topic to avoid an argument then he bought up something about a boy who was in same class as me in Germany. I told him I have a feeling he is gay as he acts like that he is like a girly girl with girls and kinda touchy with boys as I have once witnessed sitting on lap of another boy in our class then I added he used to sit next to me as our seating is arranged by the teacher and this boy have once drank my coffee and shared a sandwich to me this have angered him as I haven't told him this before as I never felt it important. And he added that he have also heard something bad about from a friend of mine. This is new news to me and it fired all my frustrations against him as I have never once doubted him or blamed him for something another person told me because trust is a big factor for me in a relationship. I exploded with rage pouring out my heart and real feelings about him and this whole situation. I have always let go of his but behaviour to me, all the cussing all the gaslighting and manipulations. He is even claiming that I am the cause of his drinking habit like my diagnosis gave him too much stress and that's why he is drinking. He also says casually that he is I have always stop the files as I thought one person and relationships should let go of the ego and stop the fight and I want a peace and not fighting or arguing. I said sorry even if it was his fault I begged him to stay. Even didn't forgave him for insulting my parents. Everything just because I loved him and what he did for me was huge. Put whenever a fight escalates he always bring up the fact that she have to care of me and he lost everything for me and kind of guilt tripped me. But I have finally came to my senses and stopped endorsing all this silently and have talked back and told him don't try to scare me this time as sometime she have kind of blackmailed me or me that he is going to call my dad and say pay me I took care of your daughter and to insult me but this time I have totally was done and told him to do whatever he wants and I want change my decision because it's really done if I don't know like you have told me this is also for him to but I don't know he will call me later tomorrow and ask me to stay or guilt trip me more 
Edit: I'm still dealing with my health issues, and this situation is taking a toll on me. I'm looking for advice or stories from others who might have gone through something similar.

I’ve recently been diving deeper into the world of Vietnamese coffee, and I have to say it’s one of the most underrated brews out there. Known for its bold, rich flavour (thanks to Robusta beans), it offers a completely different experience compared to the usual Arabica blends we’re used to.

https://preview.redd.it/4fus0nan4rjf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=333607545ea5b884d52b695f86868437e1ad242b

What I love most is the versatility. You can enjoy it hot through the traditional *phin filter*, or pour it over ice with condensed milk for that iconic *cà phê sữa đá*. Both ways deliver a smooth, strong, and aromatic cup that stands out.For those in the region, you can even find Vietnamese coffee options in Dubai that bring authentic flavours straight from Vietnam’s farms. The good news? You can [buy whole beans and ground coffee online](https://thecaphevietnam.com/collections/coffee), so whether you’re a pour-over fan, espresso lover, or phin-filter traditionalist, you can brew it your way.If you haven’t tried it yet, I’d highly recommend giving Vietnamese coffee a go. It’s strong, distinctive, and has a cultural charm that makes every sip special.

### Training
This is half race report and half review of the 8k-10k 2 schedule from Faster Road Racing by Pfitzinger & Latter.

I started this 12 week block with 1 major goal in mind and that was a sub 40 minute 10k so coming into this block I had 4 weeks after my marathon which I had a week off for recovery then I had 3 weeks to get used to my ""new"" schedule I wanted going forward which consisted of 3 strength training sessions per week (Push, Pull, Legs), 1 cycle per week, and then the runs by Pfitz.

I chose this plan as I've used Pfitzinger plans a couple times now, most recently for my marathon in April so I was familiar with his style of runs and all the terminology he uses so it was just down to the mileage I wanted peak at. I picked Schedule 2 as I am comfortable running around 90km, as I chose the 18/55 marathon plan and have peaked at that for various other races but didn't want to step up to the higher mileage plan as my work schedule doesn't really work with running doubles and I wanted that extra time to really nail my cross training/strength training as I feel I've been lacking in this area previously.

For the LT runs and any 5k race pace runs I used the pace chart in the back of the book to get the paces and used a 5k race from the end of my marathon training so it was recent enough for me to feel it appropriate. I followed the plan pretty closely the only things I changed were the Speed sessions on Saturdays were at 800-1mile pace and I've never raced anything less than a 5k and no interest in it really so I just swapped those sessions for a hard effort parkrun instead but completed the total mileage for the day. 

I had to move a couple of the runs around just due to time restraints on certain days but my main schedule was Monday: Push + Bike, Wednesday: Pull, Friday: Legs and the runs in the order in the book but on the week's there is a 5k tune up race I swapped the Push and Legs gym sessions to give my legs more time to recover before the tune up races.

Like I said earlier all paces were based off a 5K race in my Marathon Training which was a 19:40 so I used a rough approximate between 19:30 and 20:00 on the chart but my actual paces were the following:

General Aerobic/Long Runs: I started at about 5:30/km which is slower than the chart but these runs were always after a 8 hour shift in work but they soon progressed down generally ending about 5:00/km

Lactate Threshold Runs: the chart said between 4:03-4:09/km I did stay generally between these times but towards the end of the training block it was creeping under 4:03 and was getting to about 4:00/km but there were a couple times it was above 4:09/km as we've had some unusually warm weather for Northern Ireland so it made some training hard

Recovery Runs: I didn't even pay attention on these runs to pace but it was anywhere from 5:45/km to 6:15/km especially after some of the heavy sessions

vO²Max runs: the first vO²Max run started at 3:55/km which was 5k pace but then as the block went on I felt so much fitter and that pace felt too easy so I swapped it from the pace to running it to feel and it soon dropped to 3:50/km and then dropped a bit lower depending on the rep

The thing I like about Pfitz is that he includes tune up races since I like racing and although he included 2 5k tune ups I ended up doing 1 10k tune up and 1 5k parkrun tune up. The 10km tune up race I knew I wouldn't be able to get a good time as the course is very hilly and muddy but I have done the race multiple times before so I was aiming for a course PB. My time on the 10k tune up was 42:54 but was a 3 minute course PB so I was extremely happy with this time.

The last 5k tune up, I went to Victoria Park in Belfast which is a flat fast parkrun so my main goal going into the parkrun was a new 5k PB but given my big fitness improvements during this block I felt fairly confident. I ended up running a massive PB and ran a 18:41 5k. This was great news for my A goal of sub 40 it then left me feeling a bit lost as to how to pace the 10k and how fast I could possibly go

### Pre-race
The good thing about this race is that it's my local town race so getting there takes 2 minutes. I had my usual 2 bagels with jam and coffee for breakfast and had a Rice Krispies Squares bar and tin of Monster about 90 minutes before the race as it was a 1:30pm start time. The weather this week had been warming up so it was about 20°c which for NI is warm. I got to the start area around 12:50 mainly to be sociable with other people I know. I did a 1 mile warm up around 1pm with some strides at the end and then went to the toilet and then found some other runners around the same speed as me to ask them about their game plan

### Race
I positioned myself right next to the 40 minute pacer as the game plan was stay with the pacers for the first 500m and evaluate how I'm feeling in the heat and if I'm fine push on. After the first 500m a couple of us started to break off and push on, I asked the pacer before what they're plan was and they said they were starting out a bit too fast to make up time for the hill at halfway so I knew even if I stayed with them I'd be under 4:00/kms. After 1km the 40 minute pacer was firmly behind me and a pack of about 5 others and then by the time we got to the seafront at 2km it was just me and 2 others. We go past where the finish is and run around the Quay at 3km with some tight corners and it's just me and one other guy but we are closing in on others in the distance. There was a water stop around the 4km mark which is much needed before the slow incline up to the turn around point. I was trying not to look at my watch constantly and just run it to feel but at every autolap I had a quick glance to make sure I was still on track. We get to the turn around point at 4 mile which I had a friend hand me a bottle of water which I promptly drenched myself with to help cool me down and now it's just pretty much a straight road to the finish. The last 2 miles had a headwind but it was a blessing to help cool us down and then when I got to 9km I gave it all I got and I crossed the line in 38:34 which is over a 2 minute PB

### Post-race
After the race I went to chat to some of my friends who came down to support and then went to find my family who were on the finish straight. After I watched some friends cross the finish line we went over to the local park where they had food and entertainment on for the runners and families.

Overall I put this massive PB to having a solid strength and conditioning routine in place and the style of Pfitz runs really suit me well. I really enjoyed the LT and vO²Max runs and as I got fitter I could feel them getting easier as the weeks went on. I do feel he understates the level of fitness you need to be in going into the plan but if you have a decent level of fitness going in then Pfitz plans are easy enough. I would of liked to have gone for the higher mileage plan but I knew I would have burnt out trying to cram it all in

Selecting the right⁢ sencha can be daunting,given ⁣the numerous options ⁢available.

## key Features analysis

The⁣ quality of sencha green tea is determined by several key​ factors, ⁣including the cultivation method, the processing techniques, and ‍the final leaf appearance. ⁤Each brand utilizes different approaches, resulting in a‍ diverse range of ⁣flavors and ​aromas. This analysis will break down⁣ those essential features.**Cultivation method:** The way sencha tea leaves are ⁣grown considerably influences their ‍flavor profile and nutrient content.

Sencha is ⁢typically grown in full sunlight, which encourages rapid growth and results in a tea with⁢ a bolder, more astringent taste. Some brands, though, may utilize shaded cultivation methods for a ⁤portion of the growing season to enhance sweetness and umami. The type of soil, the altitude of the tea ‌garden, and the use of‍ organic or conventional farming practices all contribute to the tea's overall quality. Higher quality sencha often comes from tea farms that ​prioritize sustainable and environmentally friendly cultivation methods.

**Steaming Process:** The steaming process (or *steaming level*) is crucial for preventing oxidation and preserving the green color and characteristic flavor of sencha.

There are generally three types ​of steaming: *Asamushi* (lightly steamed), *Chumushi* (medium steamed), and *Fukamushi* (deeply steamed). asamushi sencha retains a needle-like leaf shape and a vibrant green color, offering a lighter, more grassy flavor. Fukamushi sencha undergoes a longer steaming process, resulting in a finer leaf particle size and a richer, sweeter⁣ taste with less astringency. The steaming technique ⁣is a ‍defining characteristic⁤ and often a marketing point for brands.

**Leaf Appearance:** The appearance of the sencha leaves provides insights into⁢ the tea's ⁢quality and processing.High-quality sencha typically features tightly ⁣rolled, needle-shaped⁢ leaves with a vibrant green color. The ⁤leaves should be uniform in​ size and free from any signs ‍of browning or damage. The presence of *shincha*, or first flush tea (tea leaves harvested in the first spring harvest), is often considered a sign of superior quality, as these leaves are ⁣believed⁣ to be the most flavorful and nutritious. Leaf color vibrancy, uniformity, and ⁣structural integrity indicate careful cultivation and meticulous processing.

**Aroma and Flavor Profile:** The aroma‌ and flavor ​profile of sencha ⁤are complex and nuanced, influenced by various factors.

Different sencha brands exhibit a⁣ wide spectrum ⁢of aromas, ranging from grassy and vegetal to⁣ floral and marine-like. The​ taste can range from sweet and umami to bitter and astringent. ‍The balance between these different flavor notes is a key indicator of quality. Descriptors like ""crisp,"" ""refreshing,"" ""smooth,"" and ⁤""complex"" signify a well-produced sencha.

Key features of the top ⁤Sencha brands in 2025 include:

*   Sustainable Farming ⁤Practices
*   Expert Steaming Techniques
*   Premium Leaf Selection
*   Distinct​ Flavor Profiles

## Core Benefits

Sencha green tea offers a multitude of benefits beyond its refreshing taste. From boosting ​energy levels to promoting ‌overall well-being, sencha is a natural and healthy ​beverage choice. The following outlines some of the core benefits.

**Enhanced Energy ‌and Focus:** Sencha contains caffeine,providing a gentle and sustained energy boost without the jitters often⁣ associated with coffee. The presence of ⁢L-theanine, an amino acid, further enhances focus and concentration by promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety.

The combination‌ of caffeine and ⁤L-theanine in​ sencha creates ​a synergistic effect, resulting⁣ in improved mental clarity and cognitive function. This makes sencha ⁣an ideal beverage for students, professionals, and anyone seeking a natural⁤ way to enhance their productivity. Many people have replaced their afternoon coffee with Sencha to avoid that 'crash' feeling ‌later in the day.

**Rich⁣ in Antioxidants:** Sencha is packed with antioxidants, particularly catechins, which protect the ⁤body against free radicals and oxidative stress. These antioxidants have been ⁣linked to ‌various health benefits, including ⁢reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.

Regular consumption of sencha can help strengthen⁤ the immune system, improve skin health, and promote‍ overall well-being.The high concentration of Epigallocatechin ​gallate (EGCG), a powerful catechin, makes sencha a potent antioxidant source. Antioxidants help protect your​ body ⁤from cellular damage caused by free radicals, associated with several diseases.**Improved‍ Metabolism and Weight Management:** Studies suggest‍ that sencha can aid in weight management⁢ by⁤ boosting metabolism and ⁣promoting fat oxidation. The catechins in sencha may help increase energy⁢ expenditure and reduce body⁤ fat accumulation.

While sencha alone is not⁢ a⁤ miracle weight loss solution, it⁢ can be ⁣a⁢ valuable addition to a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Drinking sencha before ‍or after workouts may enhance fat burning and‌ improve overall⁤ fitness results. Many dieticians suggest a ⁢cup of Sencha before a ⁣workout⁣ for these reasons.

**Promotes Relaxation and reduces ⁢Stress:** Despite containing caffeine, sencha can also ‌promote‍ relaxation and reduce stress due ‌to the presence of L-theanine. L-theanine has been shown to increase alpha brain waves, which are associated ‌with a ⁣state of⁤ calm and ⁣focused alertness.

Enjoying a ‍cup of sencha can be a calming ritual that helps you unwind and de-stress. Its soothing aroma and delicate flavor⁤ create a sensory experience ‍that promotes relaxation and well-being.

1mthqtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ResolveScared770/comments/1mthqtk/i_am_stuck_with_a_boy_in_my_head_we_never_dated/,I am stuck with a boy in my head (we never dated),"I am here just to let it out. Got a recommendation from a friend, she said she lets her emotions out by writing poems and singing. Since I am not really good at that, I registered on Reddit. I would read or listen to stories from here, but this is my first time posting. I guess I will treat it as a diary. Would really appreciate some comments, thoughts and advice though. I'm warning you: It is going to be long and english is not my first language, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes.

I am an 18 year old female and I have just graduated High School and just so you know, I am from a Central Asian country and my family is conservative and pretty religious. They don't know I am leaning more towards atheism and that I am bisexual. I finished IBDP and I feel cooked. I recently have decided to take a gap year after getting rejected by all the universities abroad where I have applied. It will be important.

So in the beginning of the second semester of my senior year two guys transferred to my school, which is a very small international school where everyone in High School knew each other. One of them was my type, but they were sophomores. I looked at one of them, who seemed like my type: blue eyes, blonde shoulder-length hair and pretty tall, about 6 '1"".Let's call him Nick. Nick looked like this skater type of guy with baggy clothes and jewelry, so I laughed with my friends that If I was 14, I'd be running around that guy. His friend, Alec, also had a similar style, fluffy hair, but looked more like a central asian guy, which is actually my friend's type. I had a boyfriend of 3 months at that time. I had my mock exams coming too, and we ended up breaking up before them. Just so you know, when we started dating, I was 17 and he was 16. He was a junior in my high school and I was older than him by a year and a couple of months. We actually ended on good terms, but simply stopped talking after a couple of weeks.

So after my mock exams my classmates thought about a graduation dance, waltz, to be specific. It's like a tradition to dance at the graduation ceremony. It was around the end of March, before the spring break, when we had to choose partners and define the number of couples, so the dance could be made. In my year, which basically only had 25 people, there were mostly girls. And girls are pretty tall compared to boys. I am around 5 '8"" and the taller guys got chosen quickly, so some of us, who wanted to dance, ended up without couples. So we looked through the juniors, but their year mostly consisted of new students, plus their boys were a little too short for us. Moreover, no one really wanted to dance with my ex. So we went to talk to some sophomores. It was only for the dance, they had pretty tall guys and we knew them better, since most of them were in the sports teams and travelled to the tournaments with us. I played basketball and got an MVP this year. I came up to a couple of boys, some said they didn't wanna dance, the others were already taken, so me and my close friend, Sarah, ended up with no one to dance with. We were the ones initiating the dance in the first place, because we thought it's fun, so we didn't know what to do. 

So, as a last option, I decided to try asking Nick if he wants to dance with me. We have never spoken before. I asked around and it turns out that he actually doesn't talk much. In around 3 months of studying with him, some people from his class never even heard his voice. He would wear headphones all the time and never stayed in the cafeteria for longer than needed. He was always with his friend Alec and talked only to a few people who said that he wasn't really nice in his old school a couple of years ago, but said he seems nice now. I have never seen him smile though. I found that a little weird, but still decided to approach him. I caught him in the cafeteria one day and he took off his headphones, a little surprised. I was super nervous and even shaking. I am an introvert with a little social anxiety with strangers. So I introduced myself, briefly said what we wanted to do and asked him if he was not in a rush. He said he has a class, but I said that I could finish by the end of the break. I started talking faster, when I was nervous, and it was kind of funny because I was yapping and he was just  saying ""mhm"" and nodding. In the end I said ""So what do you think?"". When I didn't get a reply fast enough, I said that I will give him until tomorrow to think about it and asked for his instagram account to contact him. I, with shaky hands, gave him my phone and I SWEAR I SAW HIM SMILING AND BLUSHING A LITTLE. I would say I am a pretty girl, but his reaction made me smile.  So Nick gave me his instagram and I said thanks, followed him, he followed me back after an hour or so. The following day I went to a party, had a little drink and texted him ""So what do you think?"", he replied pretty fast, saying that he is okay with it. We never talked after that, then during spring break, I once texted him asking for his number to add him to the group chat about the dance information, he just sent me the number without saying anything. The funny thing is, his friend, Alec, asked my best friend Sarah if he could dance with her. They have never even talked before that. Turns out that one of the teachers told him that since his friend Nick is dancing, Alec should invite Sarah, since me and Sarah are besties. 

After the break we came up with a schedule for rehearsals, so that's like the very beginning of April. On the first few rehearsals Nick was quiet, barely talking. We would simply say hi and I even remember asking him how he is doing, he simply looked away, smiled and just nodded. He would barely touch me, let go of my hand immediately and step aside, so I did that too to not just awkwardly stand there on my own. I would go talk to the guy classmate of mine, Dan, who has a girlfriend who I know too. Dan was my close friend who helped me with the boy drama I had before. At that time I remember joking about how Nick is so secretive and I want to open up this guy. 

After a few rehearsals Nick started talking to me though. We kind of had a few small talks, but never even said hi to each other outside of the rehearsals, like he would walk past me like he didn't know me. He started liking my stories though. One day Sarah suggested inviting Nick and Alec to grab a coffee with us after the rehearsal. I agreed and invited them. On the way, we kind of started talking as pairs, me with Nick and Sarah with Alec. I wanted a drink somewhere else in the mall we were in and Nick went with me, while Sarah and Alec sat on the table of the coffee shop. My online card stopped working for some reason and Nick offered to pay, but his app wasn't working too, so the seller said we could pay later when it will start working. Then we joined the others. I told Sarah what happened and she offered to pay by her card, and I did. And four of us just talked. Nick wasn't much of a yapper, he sat quietly, I mostly talked with Sarah and Alec, but noticed that Nick was staring at me. Our eyes would meet and I would silently show him something, like nod to Sarah's words and he would smile or laugh. That day we found out that Alec is basically my neighbor and that Sarah and Nick live in the same direction. So Nick left with Sarah. Alec walked me home, we talked about school, it was really nice, he seemed like a polite guy. But when I got home, I received a dm from Nick, asking if I ended up paying for my drink. I told him that he saw me using Sarah's card and it seemed more like an excuse to text. We texted for a little. The next day we had a rehearsal and since I had training, I left earlier. After the training, I saw a message from Nick, asking where the tournament which I mentioned in the rehearsal, was supposed to be the next day. While texting that day, he said he wants to do something interesting, I told him to go for it and just subtly added that I am planning to go for a walk, he asked where and said he wants to join me. I told he doesn't have to, since I live pretty far from him, but he insisted, said he would take a taxi. We met up. Honestly, it felt like there was someone else in front of me. Nick was wearing a bright yellow t-shirt, when usually he would wear plain colors and had a hoodie tied around his shoulder, while I had a leather jacket. The second we met, he started yapping and didn't shut up for the entire evening. I saw a completely different side of him, he was open, smiling a lot and just, felt like for the first time, was very involved in a conversation. We were sitting on a bench in a park, when we were approached by some men who wanted to get our numbers, but when they realized that we weren't two girls, they left. Nick is well-built, but maybe because of the hair and because it was dark, he was mistaken for a girl. It became an inside joke. Like he would say something like ""A girl like me..."". In the beginning, when we sat on the bench, we were sitting basically on opposite ends, but I noticed that after some time he ended up right next to me, with our shoulders touching. When we headed home, I said that it's kinda cold. He offered me his hoodie, I wore it and gave him my jacket, so he was walking around holding it. I took a funny picture of him, he later posted it to his story. He walked me home that day, we had an awkward hug. I was about to take off his hoodie, when he told me to keep it, which was surprising, but I gave it back, then he left. I asked him to text me when he will get home, but he met some friends on the way. Basically, he had an app that allowed his friends to see each other's location and they were surprised since he doesn't show up in that specific part of the city. So using that app his friends found him and they hung out for a little longer. He got home really late though. Still, the next day I was at the tournament, he constantly texted me, basically for the entire day, he left me on read for 30 mins, but later said he simply fell asleep. He even offered to order me a taxi in the evening. I said I wanted to walk. On the last day of the tournament, we texted for a little and he mentioned his another hoodie from the previous conversation, I asked him if he would bring it, he said sure and took a taxi to a very very far part of the city and met me, took my bag and I put on his hoodie. We started walking around, heading towards my house, which was super far. We sat on benches since I was tired after the entire day of the tournament and I would just put my head on his shoulder to rest. Whenever he said something I didn't like, I would jokingly turn around and he would come to me and take my hand or push me towards the right way. I drank his favorite energy drink he had with him. Once, we sat down and he put his head on my shoulder, I put my head on his and he said he could fall asleep, since he was so comfortable and the view was amazing, only because he was with me. I found that really cute. He walked me home again and left, we texted for a while after he got home. Just to clarify: he was a year and 5 months younger than me. He said he liked older girls. For me, at that time, it was more like a fun thing, nothing too serious.

The other time I posted a story from a walk. I went out to smoke, since my parents don't know that I do and I had to get further from my home. He replied to it, asked me where I was, took a taxi and said he was in the gym when he saw my story. I told him he didn't have to come if he was busy, he laughed and said he knew I was gonna say that if he told me he was in the gym when texting. I was kinda cold, since I was sitting while waiting for him and he actually took off his hoodie and gave it to me. I was freezing but wanted to spend time with him and he gave me his hoodie, so I was wearing two and he was in a t-shirt. When we sat down, I wrapped my hands around his arm, because his arm was very warm, while my hands were cold. That day he texted me that his hoodie smelled really nice and that apparently his house was cold, so he slept in it. I saw him wearing the hoodie he gave me a couple of times at school. The next day he walked me home after a rehearsal and we sat down for a little while and he put his head on my lap, so I played with his hair while he just lied there. He said he loved it and we did that quite often when sitting down on a bench on the other hang outs. Once he even playfully took my phone and hugged my arm, while I was playing with his hair with the other one and he just looked at me. He even sent me a video of himself on my lap, laughing. And when I asked him why he was giggling, he said that it's because it's cute. He added that whenever he laughs at a rehearsal or when I look at him, it's also because it was cute. We would always hug a couple of times before he left. He started smiling at me at school. He opened up about his troubles, told me that he thinks about them a lot, but I help him to forget about it. He would pull me back for a hug when I stood up from the bench because we needed to go. He would hold my hands to warm them up. When he was cold though, I remember I was in a jacket, but he was wearing a hoodie and I held his hands in mine, then hugged his arm while walking, so he would be warm. Nick was like a puppy when he looked at me and smiled. He would immediately come to me whenever I asked him to or even said “Hey, I am about to go for a walk”. He would ask me to talk to him a little more. He supported me when I missed the deadline and was stressed about it. He told me that I could text him anytime and he said he went to bed really late that night, and I assumed he waited for me to text. Sometimes, when he wasn't in the mood, I wouldn't pressure him, I just filled the silence with constant yapping, asking him “Should I drop my entire biography?”, he would laugh and agree. After resting on my lap for a little, he would stand up and say that he cannot stop smiling. We even played basketball together. Sometimes we lied under the stars and talked. He would sometimes just look at me for a while in silence. He told me I am pretty. I told him I loved spending time with him, he said that too. Nick was very genuine with me, it felt like he started falling for me. Soon after though, I received an invitation for an interview from one of the universities and the thought that I might leave hit me. We weren’t talking for that long, I never thought of what we are, I just enjoyed spending time with him, without thinking about the future. But after that, I seriously thought about having that conversation with him. The issue with Nick was that he wasn’t super initiative, he never really asked me out himself, I was the one subtly letting him know when I am free and he would immediately come running. So in general, I was sure we would never date, it was casual, no kissing, even though there was A LOT of physical touch, which I loved, since it’s my love language. I cared about Nick, but not enough to consider him as a dating partner, especially because I was sure I would study abroad and leave in a couple of months. So I told him that he would be here, since he is a sophomore and I might leave. He didn’t take it well, and went silent. He has this habit of going silent when upset or not in the mood. But his mood got better after. I just put it out there that we were casual. 

I invited him to go out with me once more, he said he had a headache and could use some walking, but he was quieter than usual, so I let him rest on my lap, he definitely was better afterwards. We had a long hug, he left. We didn’t talk for a couple of days afterwards, I didn’t text, he didn’t. It was the very end of April, beginning of IB exams. We were on study-leave so no classes, I barely saw him too. That’s when the energy shifted. I talked to some of my friends, Sarah was there too. At that time her and Alec were in a weird position, she said Alec would just pull out some weird stuff and it is just that boys their age are unpredictable and we don’t know anything about them. Another friend told me that I should stop leading Nick on, since, as she said: “Knowing you, you will get over it pretty fast, but he won’t. Look at you, you are amazing, how could he not keep falling for you? But you will leave, he will be left behind. That’s very selfish of you.” And that made me think. I thought that she was right. I wasn’t sure of my feelings for him, so I had to stop it to protect him, even if I enjoyed his company and I had to focus on my exams. So I did. I never texted him afterwards. I told myself that if he texts me, I will talk to him about it, but he didn’t. I saw him around school a couple of times, he was there for exams too, and waved as a greeting, but never talked. Then I got exams. Nick would like my stories sometimes. Oh, and we stopped all the rehearsals during the exams too. Then it was his birthday. I had one of my last exams that day, saw his story, but never texted him, which was fully my fuck up. I saw him the next day, I would feel really nervous whenever I saw him, so I didn’t know what to do. Then Sarah said: “Oh, by the way, happy birthday”. I said that too, but he thanked us and kept walking. The fact that Sarah said it first, on top of the fact that I knew, made it worse for sure. I finished my last exam that day and went out for drinks with friends. I texted Nick, asking him if he could go for a walk with me, he said he just got home, so can’t go out again. To be fair, I would usually text him around 6-7pm, that day it was 11pm. He was very cold. I accepted it, even though I was sad. 

My year went on a trip to the lake after exams and we had to start waltz rehearsals afterwards. I had to see Nick again, almost everyday. I spent a lot of time talking to Dan on the trip, told him the whole story and confessed that I definitely miss Nick. I tried to push that thought away during the exams, but couldn’t hold myself when drunk, his cold response made it worse. I thought I ruined everything between us. Instead of supporting each other during exams, I made it worse by pushing him away. I decided to apologize and talk to figure it out. I wrote him a message, apologizing and explaining, asking to talk in person sometime. He said something like: “Thanks for texting. I understand. It was similar to the last time you did something like this. And yes, we could talk sometime.” I thought we were good. But during the rehearsal he was cold and distant. I could feel it. I would catch him looking at me from a distance, we would talk sometimes, but he would leave immediately after the rehearsal, even without saying bye. I once asked him if he wanted to grab a coffee with me, he simply said he was going to gym, but I saw him walk past me, I texted him that he could at least tell me he was going to go eat in the mall, he left me on “read”. On the rehearsals things seemed better, but in fact, they weren’t. He sent me a friend request on snapchat though, which I accepted and we started sending snaps. I once texted him about what he was going to wear to the graduation and suggested some ideas to match. He left me to “read” again. I felt like a desperate ex at that point. I felt like I was approaching him over and over and he would just reject me. I posted stories from places we used to go, he even liked some of them, but never texted. I was feeling odd, because how could someone care about you so much and then just simply forget about you and pretend they don’t care? On the day of the graduation he did what I asked him to though. He posted a story with his fit, sent me a snap with it too. We did some texting that day, it was fun. Before the dance, he told me not to look him in the eye, I said okay. After the dance he disappeared. Some people from school were leaving for a trip, he did too, I didn’t sign up for it. I texted him, thanked for everything and asked if he would come to the last school event, because I wanted to talk. He said maybe and asked what I want to talk about, I said that he doesn’t have to if he doesn’t want to, I just need to talk. He said he will be there. He sent me a lot of pics every day, I liked some of them. We ended up talking in the last school event. I was mad at him that day since whenever I asked him where he was or where he would be comfortable, he rejected my suggestions, so I exploded and said “don’t want to talk? just say so”. We ended up talking though. I told him I don’t get those responses and this treatment, I asked him if he even wanted to talk to me because I was sick of it, that I could just never approach him ever again, since I am graduating. He went quiet and looked like he was about to cry, he stopped looking me in the eye, started blinking faster. I asked my question differently, I asked if he would go out with me if I asked him to, he said yes. I asked if he would text me himself, he agreed. And we ended up saying that we would keep talking throughout the summer. We joined our friend groups, later, his friend came to me to say bye, but Nick was nowhere to be seen. I thought it’s okay. I texted him a couple of days later, playfully saying: “Would you want to invite me for a walk today at 7-8?”, his response was “maybe”. I told him I am not where I used to live. He just read my message. At 7 I texted him, asking what we were doing, he just read it. I went for a walk myself, then noticed he disappeared from my snap map for a while, then appeared again. I was very angry, so said “Just let me know if you cannot or don’t want to meet, don’t make me wait please.” He again left me on “read”. I was done with it at this point, because how can you say that you would do something and never actually do it? I gave him a week. If he wouldn’t text me, it would be over. And he didn’t. I removed him from my friends on snapchat. A few days later he unfollowed me from his and unfollowed from my account on instagram. I thought it was over, but I kept feeling betrayed, so I added him on snapchat, wrote a long text about how I am done with this behaviour. He only read it, never replied. It has been two months since then. He is still my friend on snapchat. No snaps though. I posted a story there, and he watched it within a minute. 

His instagram account is open, I saw his reposts, that are kind of related to me, but I am not sure. I keep thinking about him. I feel betrayed, because how could he say that he will and just don’t do anything? If he said he didn’t want to talk to me ever again, I would be hurt, but I would accept it. Why give me hope and then take it away? I know I ruined it, but I tried making it up to him, he seemed to accept it, but actually never did? I don’t know. I miss him so much. If he would just text me, I would go back to it immediately. I once even went into the coffeeshop he was at, didn’t dare to look around, just grabbed a coffee and left. I walked past his house more than I should’ve, when I had some stuff to do in that area. My friends think that he was just not that into me, I refuse to believe it, because in the beginning I had no doubt that he liked me a lot. Did I hurt him too much? Was he scared to get hurt again? I don’t know. I still want to talk to him to clarify everything, but the remains of my pride won’t let me. I feel stuck. I looked through old pics with him, stalk his account. I even have a thought that he has someone new. I really can’t tell what is in his head now. How could he just be genuine and nice, then be like this? 

I feel like screaming into the void. But that’s at least something to let my emotions out. I have been avoiding the fact that I miss him very much, but I think it’s time to accept it and live with it. So here I am. My summer was tough. I had a lot of issues related to my mental state, but now I feel better and I feel that my feelings for him are occupying my mind again. Maybe it is my fault for saying we are casual and demanding clarity? He is also the first boy that I feel so strong about. I only had girls in my mind before. I had a crush on my ex, but this wasn’t that deep, because he was an emotionally closed person, but Nick was super open. 

Thank you very much if you have read it this far. Wish you all CLARITY and PARTNERS THAT ARE GOOD AT COMMUNICATION. Take care of yourself!

I’m 24, in Bangalore currently, and working as a dev. Life’s been feeling a little too routine lately... work all week, quiet weekends... Soo I figured, maybe meeting someone cool to talk to (or more) could shake things up in the best way.

I’m 5'10"", wear glasses, into swimming, volleyball, watches F1 and sometimes I sketch (happy to share if you're curious!). I’d like to think I’m decent looking and well definitely not camera shy. 😄

Honestly, I’m open to where this goes. A good chat, some banter, late-night convos, weekend chill sessions, maybe cuddles or more if we vibe well. No pressure. No expectations. Just someone to share energy and space with, even if it’s just virtually at first.

If we click, we can move the chat to a more private platform voice calls, deeper convos, maybe meet for a coffee or a movie binge.

Just be open minded, real, and not into ghosting. Life’s weird enough already.

1mthoo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1mthoo5/dialing_in_beans_for_kf7super_automatics_in/,Dialing In Beans for KF7/Super Automatics in general,"Hi all! Excited to share that I’m moving into the super automatic team, with a KF7 coming in the next week. I’ve had a semiautomatic (Breville Barista Pro) for 4 years and it has served me well. But with a newborn, I just haven’t had energy to do things like dial in beans anymore (I generally don’t stick with the same beans as I’m always exploring different coffee shops).

My question is sort of two-fold… 1) In general, how do super automatic machines “dial in” beans? For my Breville, I’d sometimes go through a quarter of my bag until I find the right grind size and extraction timing fell into the ideal window; 2) For those with a KF7, how do you dial-in your beans (understanding maybe it’s also by preference)? I’ve read some people said just max out the settings since the puck size won’t be like the one I’m used to (54mm).

I also know the quality of the shot won’t be the same between the KF7 and Breville, so expectations are managed here! Just wanted to get some takes from the community!

1mtho3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mtho3k/could_the_delonghi_nespresso_vertuo_plus_coffee/,Could the De'Longhi Nespresso Vertuo Plus Coffee Maker Review Change Your Morning Routine?,"Testing the De'Longhi ENV150BM Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker, Matte Black, felt like welcoming a sleek barista into my kitchen. This product was effortless to set up, and I immediately felt the designer intent behind it. Featuring Centrifusion technology, it spins coffee pods like a graceful dancer—an undeniably cool feature. With a gorgeous matte black exterior, the unit exudes a minimalist elegance that pairs beautifully with modern kitchens, grabbing attention from coworkers who often visit.

**Highlights**

- Brews both coffee and espresso with the same machine.  
- Four brewing options, spanning 5 oz and 8 oz coffee, plus single and double espressos.  
- Energy-saving option through an automatic shut-off.  

One of my favorite parts is the way it heats up in just 20 seconds. The time between placing the pod and having a hot cup in my hand was quicker than waiting in line at a coffee shop. Similarly, the removable 40 oz water tank intrigued me; it adjusted to snugly fit various counter layouts in my space, a feature that's perfect for compact spaces or minimal cabinets. I also loved the automatic capsule ejection system—no digging around for used pods here.

[View De'Longhi ENV150BM Nespresso VertuoPlus pricing on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07gbjq38k/)

**What Makes It Unique?**

Operating this fantastic coffee maker feels intuitive thanks to its fully automatic interface. It gets added brownie points for supporting Nespresso capsules (coffee explorers like me appreciate the variety). The reusable filter option means I skip disposable waste, which keeps things environmentally conscious. 

Speaking of taste, the machine is versatile—switching between bold hot coffees and iced lattes satisfied every coffee need I threw at it. My cousin, a hardcore iced coffee fan, couldn't stop raving about how the machine nailed the flavor every time.

**Favorable Aspects**

- Adjustable 40 oz water tank for small and large spaces.  
- Bundled starter capsule set with multiple flavors included.  
- Simplified design reduces morning clumsiness with single-button operation.  

**Areas of Concern**

- The coffee capsules are a bit pricier compared to generic pods.  
- Loud spinning sound when brewing coffee, which caught my partner off-guard during their early mornings.  
- Limited color finishes if matte black doesn't suit your aesthetic.

**Competing Products**

Considering alternatives, Keurig's K-Cafe brewer enters this conversation. While the Keurig has a comparable price tag and offers coffee-latte combos, its heating time vastly trails. Unlike the rapid heat efficiency of the VertuoPlus model, the Keurig occasionally left me tapping fingers impatiently. Nevertheless, Keurig wins slightly in the pod cost area and enjoys popularity in offices. However, for gourmet coffee and espresso, this De'Longhi unit tipped the scale with stronger customization. 

Another big name in customizable espresso makers, Breville's Bambino Plus, deserves mention. It’s undeniable that Breville provides robust extraction control, but it’s highly manual. Users seeking simplicity and set-it-forget-it convenience will likely gravitate toward the VertuoPlus Deluxe.

**Smart Spending**

Evaluating cost-efficiency, I feel it's worth what you’re paying. Sure, pod refills might chip a bit more into your wallet compared to ground coffee, but the taste-quality leap justifies it. Moreover, its build meant fewer mid-year trips to repair shops, and despite daily use, it still feels and functions like new. Is it cheap? No—but for coffee fanatics, definitely a worthwhile indulgence.

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I were in a long-distance relationship, I got diagnosed with a potentially cancerous tumor, he quit his job to care for me, and now he's blaming me for his financial struggles and job loss after I broke up with him.

I (19F) met my boyfriend (24M) online,we both are indians and we were in a long-distance relationship. We wanted to settle in Europe so first he moved to in Slovenia after getting a job and after 1½ years later i moved to in Germany for my ausbildung. At my first week in germany, I got diagnosed with a tumor in my hand that could possibly be cancerous. I immediately wanted to break up with him because I didn't want him to feel burdened by my health issues. However, he refused to break up with me and said he wanted to support me(which now he claims is because he thought it was a joke). So as he showed me support and after promissing me he will be there in every step of this journey with me. I asked him if he can come to germany to support me but I didn't forced him he could just say no if didn't wanted to . I might have pushed him a bit to come fast as he can as he promised and said he wanted me in his life and Will always be there. He came to Germany to care for me. I was touched by his gesture, but I felt guilty knowing that he was sacrificing a lot for me.Things have gotten even more complicated. He has some drinking issues, and few times at nights when he was super drunk, he tried to leave Germany and drive back to Slovenia. I stopped him because I was worried about his safety and didn't want him to have an accident. I have cut my wrist due to all the pressure and to stop him going like that after a stupid fight in that much drunk state. This has also lead to something even bad as he started to smoke cigarettes and also blamed on me as if my suicide attempt have give him so much stress and this is why he is currently smoking and he continued smoking all the way to a new addiction even smoked in our room when I have severe nausea due to chemo. He promised means to quit smoking once he get to Slovenia. And I like to believe it. Now, he's blaming me for stopping him and says I shouldn't have cared if he died. He claims I've betrayed him and his family.he had also hit me during this time and fought a lot with me when he was drunk But I forgave it because he was only like this when he drank and the other moments with him was loving and he cared for me like so much even bathed me fed me and hugged me to sleep

Fast forward to when I had to go back to India to continue my treatment as i couldn't bare it alone there with the chemo i needed my parents. He lost his current job and luckily got a new job offer in Germany, and he had to come back to Slovenia to finalize some paperwork when. I thought everything was okay, but after a few months after us trying every he could not get that job he got his visa annuled and came back to India but now he has another job offer in Slovenia but now he's blaming me for ruining his life. He's saying that i have ruined his career and caused him debt. I should have gone back to India immediately without waiting for biopsy results. I'm feeling really guilty and conflicted about the whole situation. I asked him to come to Germany because I needed his support, but I feel like he could have said no. He made those decisions on his own.

He's even bringing my dad into our conversations and  talking bad about him. I'm at a loss for what to do.

Update: Should I finalize the breakup? Despite everything, I still have feelings for him, and I appreciate the help he provided when I was alone in Germany during a really tough time. However, his current behavior is causing me a lot of stress, and I'm not sure if I can handle being in a relationship with someone who blames me like this, especially given his drinking issues.

Update 2: i have completed my treatment and is trying to recover from the side effects i have tried to make things work a lot but feel like I should Stop this relationship because I don't want him to feel burdened by my health issues recently few other problems also rose as he wanted me to convert to Christianity which I have already told I won't at the beginning of the relationship and i have to move back to Germany or Slovenia which I don't think is good with my health issues. I have denied both and told I can't do this we should stop this and just be friends and I'll completely help him return to Slovenia like not financially but dealing with paper work and guidances. We tried it for few days like still kept calling eachother and slept talking at night and few days later patched up again. This happened few times but yesterday he got drunk again and had a fight with his dad and things escalated quickly physically. I was mad about it but haven't fought with him either lectured him until he repeatedly pushed me asking what happened that night then he told me he wanted to stop drinking plead help him i suggested that he see a doctor which he agreed to. Then at evening he pranked me saying he have been custodied by police and send me a video of him searching for something tensed without any explanation i got super worried and stressed and when I called him as usual to sleep he told me this whole thing was a prank. Then I told him I feel tensed and feel like going to hospital to check my pressure and can I go to my mom's room to sleep because it can call me down. But he reacted like then why did you call me I know you are like this you always wants to be sleep with your mom you don't care about me and all. Yes it's partially true because I'm not really comfortable to talk to him these days as I'm too stressed to deal with his drama. I have changed the topic to avoid an argument then he bought up something about a boy who was in same class as me in Germany. I told him I have a feeling he is gay as he acts like that he is like a girly girl with girls and kinda touchy with boys as I have once witnessed sitting on lap of another boy in our class then I added he used to sit next to me as our seating is arranged by the teacher and this boy have once drank my coffee and shared a sandwich to me this have angered him as I haven't told him this before as I never felt it important. And he added that he have also heard something bad about from a friend of mine. This is new news to me and it fired all my frustrations against him as I have never once doubted him or blamed him for something another person told me because trust is a big factor for me in a relationship. I exploded with rage pouring out my heart and real feelings about him and this whole situation. I have always let go of his but behaviour to me, all the cussing all the gaslighting and manipulations. He is even claiming that I am the cause of his drinking habit like my diagnosis gave him too much stress and that's why he is drinking. He also says casually that he is I have always stop the files as I thought one person and relationships should let go of the ego and stop the fight and I want a peace and not fighting or arguing. I said sorry even if it was his fault I begged him to stay. Even didn't forgave him for insulting my parents. Everything just because I loved him and what he did for me was huge. Put whenever a fight escalates he always bring up the fact that she have to care of me and he lost everything for me and kind of guilt tripped me. But I have finally came to my senses and stopped endorsing all this silently and have talked back and told him don't try to scare me this time as sometime she have kind of blackmailed me or me that he is going to call my dad and say pay me I took care of your daughter and to insult me but this time I have totally was done and told him to do whatever he wants and I want change my decision because it's really done if I don't know like you have told me this is also for him to but I don't know he will call me later tomorrow and ask me to stay or guilt trip me more 
Edit: I'm still dealing with my health issues, and this situation is taking a toll on me. I'm looking for advice or stories from others who might have gone through something similar. How did you handle it? Should I prioritize my own well-being and end the relationship, or is there a way to work through this together?",1,1755510862.0,KeralaRelationships,0,1.0,False

1.	Mr. A – A classmate who liked me but I didn’t return his feelings and now we’re just good friends for about 8 months. He helped me get my first job in the US. Due to his job location, he moved and whenever he visits my city (once a month), we grab coffee to talk about work and life. He is my first friend in this city when I started my study here

2.	Mr. B – My best friend of 20+ years. I once stayed at his house while visiting. I slept on the sofa downstairs, (his niece room is downstair too next to the livingroom) and he slept in his room upstairs.

My bf says this is “cheating” since I still hang out with Mr. A (who once liked me) and stayed in the same house with Mr. B.

Do you think these situations are normal, or is this considered cheating?

I’m quite short and I therefore have a very low TDEE and it just doesn’t feel like enough food. 

However for the last 3 months I’ve managed to stick to my calorie goals by skipping breakfast every day meaning I can have 2 decent sized meals for lunch and dinner (700-800 calories each) which feels satisfying enough to me. 

I just have tea or coffee in the morning and nothing else until lunch at midday. If I have breakfast, even a filling healthy one like porridge it just uses up a few hundred calories and still makes me ravenous by lunchtime.

I'd like to refurbish an old coffee table (mid century- possibly teak?).

I've been reading through some posts on here and watching lots of YouTube videos, but haven't seen any recommendations for varnish remover to use in the UK. The venveer seems really thin. Does anyone have any recommendations for which stripper or type works well with thin veneer? 

Also, from my research I think I'll use oxalic acid to help with the water marks if needed after stripping. It looks like there's  an oil mark too. I haven't done this before, so any tips would be greatly appreciated!",1,1755509942.0,furniturerestoration,0,1.0,False
1mthdsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1mthdsz/6_years_from_there_to_here_from_struggling_to/,6 years from there to here - From struggling to manifest to mastering awareness,"Right… I'm here.  I still can't believe that I am even here.  Even up to a year ago, I never thought I would reach this level.  

What is here?  How do I even describe it?  It's not that I think I have mastered all this, but it's just that I don't see anything as real anymore.  Nothing is real, it's all an illusion !  it's a game, and I almost feel high just from living and BEING.

Buckle up, this could be long - If you have ever watched one of my videos, you know that I talk a lot.

Lets rewind back…   actually.. Before we go there:  I am only writing this post because I have had so many people ask me about a post I wrote in another group.   I only wrote the post because I was ""looking"" to speak to others who had hit the same level I had hit.  But instead of that happening, I just had many people asking me questions about it.  Then  I was tagged in a post in this group.  So .. here I am.   (btw.. I did end up finding my tribe, just not on reddit) 

Anyho..  6 years ago..  I had been trying out good ole law of attraction for maybe 10 years or more and gotten nowhere.  My best friend told me to write a list of qualities I wanted in my perfect partner, put it in the bottom of my draw and forget about it.   She said, go for gold because even if you got half of the list, that would be pretty good right.  I went for gold. I filled an entire A4 page back and front with everything I could possibly think of, I honestly thought it was joke. 

Well.. 6 months later some dude walked into my life and he was 99% of that list.  Problem was.. I thought he was too good to be true and that I wasn't good enough for him and well you know…  pushed him away with my bad ""self concept"".    I'm sure you have heard this story before.   I now refer to him as my ""build a bear"". Cause thats what I did.

I've had pretty good intuition all my life and I just KNEW (I could feel it in my bones -thats an aussie reference) that this was my guy.  I couldn't wrap my head around why if it was meant to be, then it wasn't happening.  Sooooooo I went searching for the answer and BOOM - Introduced to Law of Assumption.

Ok.. I am not going to bore you with the details but I struggled.. For literally years and years. I got a few earlier wins earlier on, but then everything stopped.  I tried to replicate what I did to get those first things, thinking it was the technique and not just me that had the power, but I couldn't do it, and the more I tried, the worse it got.

I obsesseddddd over this shit for literally years and years (helloo autism) , watched 1000's of videos from every creator and still felt like I missing something because I couldn't achieve that consistent success. I was in information overload for a long time and NOTHING was happening during that period.

As the years went by, things got a little more consistent but I used to see these other people tell stories where they just suddenly understood the law and their whole loves changed and it always left me in this place of - I am still missing something!!

Fast forward to : In the last maybe 18 months or so... I knew if I wanted to manifest something, I could do it. BUT... here's the thing, I would have to brute force it by ""locking in"" meaning affirming every fucking day for up to a month (depending on what it was - I am in my 40's, I am NOT manifesting free coffee over here, I am manifesting houses, cars and lump sums of money. )  But when it came to the partner - no amount of affirming was going to do shit.   I could bring him with affirming but not keep him (yep - the same story you hear everywhere) I even tried working on Self concept and all that shit but nothing was sticking.

I just got to this stage of ""I don't want to have to do shit for every single thing I want"".. there HAS to be an easier way. Neville literally says - it's effortless, and i knew I had manifested loads of things that I didn't care about without any effort.  So… I went looking for the answer, it didn't happen overnight, but i will say that over a period of about 3 months at the start of this year - everything changed.

What changed?  I discovered the I AM. (Awareness)  Like i always knew about it but not really KNEW KNEW about it.   There's conceptually getting it, then there is experiencing it firsthand.   I did a lot of research into non-duality.

The defining point was when I had one single moment a while back.   I was floating in the bath.  I didn't do it on purpose, I wasn't intending on doing it, I did it by accident. But I become one with everything. I mean, I felt like I was the I AM..   I could feel my entire reality, it's very difficult to put it into words. It felt like I was this giant GIANT ball of love & energy. Like I KNEW that everything was me, but this was just like another level. Everything was me, the entire world was JUST ME, there is no separation.  

From that moment on..  Everything changed.  I now walk through my day knowing that everything is literally just me, there is no fear, there is no worry.  Everything just flows to me.  

Yet.. This is bit that people still ask me about   So what do you do?  How do you manifest things?

Thats the thing.  I dropped everything.  I finally understood.  That there is NOTHING TO GET.  NOTHING to do.  NOTHING!!!!    JUST BE.  Just exist… as awareness.

As awareness I am already everything.  Why would I need to do anything to get something I already have?? 

I am fulfillment itself. I am the source of that fulfillment.  

What is the outside world?  It's just a mirror.  So if I am fulfilled then the mirror has to show me fulfillment.

Yet.. i am still getting people asking - BUT HOWWWWW… do you get specific desires by just being?  I don't get it.

Well this is my answer.  Do you believe your desires are meant for you? Think about it, who gives you the desire? Where does it come from? it comes from within right? God gives you your desires. So.. I mean it's crazy to think but... what if.. everything we want is because we were meant to have it.

And by going back to pure awareness, all you doing is removing all limitations the human self puts in place and everything that was meant to be yours just flows in.

Because thats what is happening. By going back to source, I removed all the resistance, removing any form of separation, I become one with my desires because they were me.

So here I am..  Finally after 6 years, I am sitting in my I AM…  which is just pure LOVE.

And yes.. Before I get comments asking about this.  Literally one hour after the bath experience, my partner started blowing up my phone and saying things he never said in 4 years.   

If I can do it - so can all you. Sometimes it just takes time. Ok not time, awareness. haha

Much love to you all.   It's your turn soon, everyone levels up eventually. ",13,1755509894.0,NevilleGoddard,3,1.0,False

So, picture this: you’re sipping your morning coffee, scrolling through social media, and you see someone talking about making money with AI. And you’re just sitting there, thinking, “Am I missing something here?” 🤔 Because let’s be real, nobody wants to be that person who’s leaving money on the table while others are cashing in. 

Well, I’ve got some juicy tidbits for you. I’m talking about **three untapped AI monetization streams** that could be your golden ticket! Seriously, if you're not diving into these, you might as well be throwing cash out the window. 😱💸 

### 1. **AI-Powered Content Creation Tools**
Okay, we all know about AI writing tools that can whip up blogs or social posts like it’s nobody's business. But what about creating a **gig or service around it**? Offer to generate personalized content for small businesses or busy professionals who just can’t find the time. 

- Plus, think about niches you can target! Coaches, local businesses, or even Instagram influencers.
- Maybe start a subscription model for regular content drops. Ka-ching!

### 2. **Automated Market Research**
Imagine this: using AI to crunch data and deliver tailored market insights for indie brands! 🎤 *Mic drop.* 

- You can set up a service that offers AI-driven reports on product trends, consumer behaviors, or competitive analysis.
- Every brand wants to know what’s hot and what’s not. You show them, and guess what? You get paid!

### 3. **AI-Enhanced Online Courses**
Ever heard of ‘teaching the teacher’? Let’s be real — there’s a demand for AI knowledge out there. But instead of just another generic online course, how about **building interactive, AI-fueled learning experiences**? 

- Use chatbots for Q&A sessions or gamification to make the learning process engaging. 
- People are hungry for learning, and if you can sprinkle in some AI magic, they’ll rave about your course and recommend it like it’s the next best thing since sliced bread.

Now, I’m not saying this is going to be an instant paycheck, but you’ve got to **start somewhere!** If you’re already leveraging AI in your workflow, why not take it a step further and turn it into a side hustle or even a full-time gig? The possibilities are endless! 🚀

I know some of you are probably thinking, *""But what if it flops?""* Well, what if it works? You could be sitting on a goldmine! And honestly, isn’t that risk worth it?

Let’s keep the convo going! What are your thoughts on these ideas? Anyone else trying to crack the code on AI monetization? Drop your thoughts below and let's brainstorm! 🧠💬",1,1755509790.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1mthcbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestaitoolz/comments/1mthcbq/i_hired_7_ai_employees_for_39month_heres_what/,I hired 7 AI employees for $39/month – here’s what happened with Marblism,"https://preview.redd.it/6o00cr6tyqjf1.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=6762638e4c39b2015ae6cd7008d2571fafe9ab0b

# 🚀 What is Marblism? A Quick Introduction

I’ve been testing out **Marblism**, and it’s honestly one of the more unique AI tools I’ve tried recently. Instead of being “just another AI chatbot,” it positions itself as a **platform of AI Employees** — each one designed to replace or support a specific role inside a business.

Think of it like this: instead of hiring a **customer support agent, an SEO writer, a social media manager, and a legal assistant**, you get an **AI version of each**, running 24/7, without needing coffee breaks or payroll.

[**✅ Try out Marblism by clicking here**](https://marblism.com/?via=best-ai-toolz)

Here’s the core idea in a nutshell:

|Feature|What It Means|Why It Matters|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**AI Employees**|Specialized agents like Cara (Support), Eva (Executive Assistant), Sonny (Social Media), Penny (SEO Writer), Stan (Lead Gen), Linda (Legal), Rachel (Receptionist)|You don’t just get “AI text,” you get job-specific skills|
|**Autonomous Work**|They run tasks without hand-holding|Saves you from micromanaging AI prompts|
|**Integrations**|Gmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, Instagram, WordPress, CRMs|They fit directly into your daily workflow|
|**Learning Ability**|Improves over time, adapts to your style|Feels less like a bot, more like a teammate|
|**Pricing**|Starts at $39/month (discounted from $119)|Way cheaper than hiring freelancers or agencies|

# 🤖 Meet the Marblism AI Employees

https://preview.redd.it/md4g8lwxyqjf1.png?width=1685&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3702d4ba3f52dd79a9e462a74e4f810478de4b0

Here’s where Marblism gets interesting. Instead of a single “do-it-all” chatbot, you get a **team of AI Employees**, each designed for a specific role inside your business.

|AI Employee|Role Replaced|What They Do|Integrations & Skills|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Cara**|Customer Support Agent|Replies to support tickets, calms upset customers, flags issues for escalation, works 24/7 in 50+ languages|Zendesk, Freshdesk, Gmail, Outlook|
|**Eva**|Executive Assistant|Organizes inbox, drafts emails (in your tone), manages calendar & meetings, labels/categorizes mail, privacy-focused|Gmail, Outlook, Google Calendar, Microsoft Calendar|
|**Sonny**|Social Media Manager|Posts 3x/day on LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, X. Creates viral-style posts, boosts engagement & followers|LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, X|
|**Penny**|SEO Blog Writer|Researches keywords, writes SEO blogs, maintains brand voice, publishes directly to CMS|WordPress, Webflow, Squarespace|
|**Stan**|Lead Generation / SDR|Finds leads, sends cold emails, enriches contacts, manages CRM follow-ups|HubSpot, Salesforce, Gmail, Outlook|
|**Linda**|Legal Assistant|Reviews contracts, summarizes legal docs, answers basic legal questions|Google Drive, OneDrive|
|**Rachel**|Receptionist|Answers calls, books appointments, transfers calls instantly|US phone number add-on|

  
When I first looked at this list, I caught myself thinking: *“Ok… but can an AI really replace a legal assistant or a receptionist?”* But the way they’ve designed it makes sense — these aren’t replacements for **lawyers** or **senior execs**, but they *do* handle the repetitive, admin-heavy stuff that usually eats hours of your week.

That’s why I see it less like “replacing employees” and more like “outsourcing the boring tasks” to AI.

What stood out to me immediately is the **positioning**:  
Instead of marketing itself as “AI that can do anything,” Marblism makes you feel like you’re actually **hiring AI staff** to fill gaps in your business. For small businesses, solopreneurs, or even agencies, that’s a pretty smart pitch.

# 📊 Marblism Platform Stats & User Impact

https://preview.redd.it/8ji8gfovyqjf1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a002f7da8732644c35c4574e6aa90bb3cf2b4d9

Marblism isn’t just about fancy AI job titles — the numbers they share are actually pretty compelling. Here’s a breakdown of what the platform claims:

|Metric|Stat|Why It Matters|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Customer Satisfaction**|92% after first week|Suggests users adapt quickly & find value fast|
|**User Rating**|4.8 / 5 average|Strong credibility from early adopters|
|**Tasks Completed**|100,000+ tasks weekly|Shows scale and consistent output|
|**Time Saved**|75% of users save 10+ hours/week|**40h/month**That’s over  , basically a work week back|
|**Industry Reach**|Supports 60+ industries|Not niche — can adapt across fields|
|**Cost Savings**|Average $5,000 saved vs agencies/freelancers|Serious ROI compared to outsourcing|

📝 **My take:**  
The **time savings** number hit me hardest. Saving \~10 hours a week is no joke. That’s the difference between constantly putting out fires vs. actually having time to work *on* your business, not just *in* it.

Also — if even half of that $5,000 savings number is accurate, the $39/month subscription is a **no-brainer** for small businesses.

# ⚙️ Key Features & Integrations

https://preview.redd.it/oa4wsil1zqjf1.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a27526aed060ea344de55e2245abc74ee6f056c

One thing I’ve learned testing AI tools: if they don’t **fit into your existing workflow**, they end up gathering dust. Marblism seems to get this right by offering broad integrations and a focus on **autonomous work**.

|Feature|What It Does|Why It’s Useful|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Unified Dashboard**|Manage multiple AI employees, tasks, and even different businesses under one account|No juggling logins or separate tools|
|**Autonomous Operation**|Agents don’t need constant prompting; they run tasks 24/7|True “set it and forget it” experience|
|**Learning & Adaptation**|Improves tone, style, and approach based on your feedback|Feels less like a bot, more like a junior teammate|
|**Onboarding in 30 Minutes**|Guided chat setup that gets AI employees running quickly|You don’t need to be “AI prompt savvy”|
|**Integrations**|Gmail, Outlook, Google Calendar, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, X, WordPress, Webflow, CRMs, Google Drive, OneDrive|Connects directly to the tools you already use|
|**Security & Privacy**|Read-only access for sensitive data (e.g., Eva for email), encrypted handling|Prevents awkward “oops AI sent that email” moments|

What I like here is the **“no prompt skills required”** angle. Some AI platforms feel like you need to be a part-time prompt engineer to get value — Marblism skips that. You just tell it your goals, and it runs.

Also, the integrations list is solid. For me, the **WordPress/Webflow publishing** and **CRM sync** are killer. That’s the stuff that usually breaks when you try to bolt AI onto your workflow.

# 💼 Real-World Use Cases (Who Should Use Marblism?)

https://preview.redd.it/u7ycwxd5zqjf1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=581d2a1ee792b8cd74f2461a0d65c6341c9d03eb

Marblism isn’t just aimed at tech startups. The way the AI employees are structured makes it useful across a bunch of industries. Here’s how it lines up:

|Type of User|How Marblism Helps|Example Tasks Covered|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Solo Entrepreneurs / Freelancers**|Acts like a mini team so you don’t drown in admin|Eva manages your inbox & calendar, Cara handles customer replies|
|**Small Businesses**|Cuts payroll costs by replacing repetitive roles|Sonny runs daily social media posts, Penny writes SEO blogs|
|**Agencies & Marketing Teams**|Lets you scale without hiring new staff|Stan handles lead gen + CRM follow-ups, Penny pumps out SEO articles|
|**E-commerce Stores**|Improves customer experience and drives sales|Cara does 24/7 support, Rachel answers calls, Stan finds new leads|
|**Consultants / Coaches**|Handles scheduling, communication, and lead flow|Eva organizes calls, Rachel books appointments, Sonny boosts online presence|
|**Legal/Professional Services**|Light legal support without hiring full-time staff|Linda reviews contracts, summarizes docs, flags issues|

This is where Marblism clicked for me. It’s not a replacement for **high-level strategy** (you still need humans for that), but it’s amazing at clearing the **time-sucking repetitive stuff**.

If you’re a **solo founder** or **running a lean business**, this feels like getting a support team without the overhead.

# 💰 Pricing & Value for Money (Is It Worth $39/Month?)

https://preview.redd.it/rj6qg5edzqjf1.png?width=332&format=png&auto=webp&s=431ad7987b07b8cf429349b9ba6a991c3b004844

Marblism keeps pricing refreshingly **simple**: one flat subscription for access to all AI Employees, plus optional add-ons for reception calls. Here’s the full breakdown:

|Plan / Feature|Details|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Base Subscription**|**$39/month** (discounted from $149)|**all AI Employees**Includes access to   (Eva, Penny, Sonny, Linda, Stan, Rachel, Cara)|
|**Tasks & Chats**|Unlimited|No hidden “credits” system like many AI tools|
|**Customization**|Personalized to your business goals|No prompting skills needed|
|**Contract**|Cancel anytime, no lock-in|Risk-free subscription|
|**Money-Back Guarantee**|7 days|Full refund if not satisfied|
|**Receptionist Add-On (Rachel)**|Free up to 15 calls/month|**US phone number**Includes a  |
|**Extra Calls**|$29/month for up to 100 calls|Can transfer calls or book directly in your calendar|
|**Integrations**|Gmail, Outlook, Calendar sync|Makes the receptionist useful for booking meetings|
|**Alternative Cost**|Typically $1,000–$3,000/month for a human receptionist or VA|Massive cost saving|

📝 **My take:**  
$39/month for **unlimited usage** across all AI roles feels ridiculously cheap compared to hiring freelancers or agencies.

Even the receptionist add-on is a killer deal: a **real receptionist** costs thousands per month, and Marblism offers the same basic functionality for **free up to 15 calls/month**.

This is one of the first AI platforms where I thought: *“Yeah, this could actually replace multiple software subscriptions AND a part-time hire.”*

# ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons of Marblism

After digging into Marblism, here’s what really stands out (and what gave me pause):

|✅ Pros|❌ Cons|
|:-|:-|
|**all AI Employees**Access to   for one flat price ($39/mo)|Receptionist calls are limited (15 free, then $29 for 100)|
|**multiple roles**Covers   (support, SEO, social, legal, admin, reception)|US phone number only for receptionist (not great for international)|
|**Unlimited tasks & chat** (no credits model)|AI Employees still need supervision for nuanced/complex tasks|
|**autonomously**Works   — no prompt engineering required|No true “creative strategist” role — it’s great at tasks, less at big-picture thinking|
|**Huge cost savings** compared to freelancers/agencies (avg. $5K/month)|New platform — long-term reliability still unproven|
|**integrations**Strong   (Gmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, WordPress, CRMs, etc.)|Some industries may need more specialized AI than what’s offered|
|**money-back guarantee**7-day  |Limited documentation compared to older platforms|
|**customer satisfaction (92%)4.8/5 rating**High   and  |Might feel “too hands-off” if you prefer micro-managing AI output|

  
The **pros clearly outweigh the cons** if you’re running a lean business. The big win is **time back + cost savings** — and you don’t have to babysit the AI with prompts.

The cons are mostly edge cases: if you’re outside the US or expect the AI to handle *highly complex or creative tasks*, it may not fully replace humans (yet).

  
👩‍💻 My Personal Experience & First Impressions

I’ve tested a ton of AI tools in the past year — most of them either feel too gimmicky or require so much prompting that it ends up being *more work than help*.

Marblism actually surprised me.

* **Setup was quick**: onboarding took about 20–30 minutes, and I didn’t have to “train” the AI like a junior employee. I just described my business, linked accounts, and it got to work.
* **Eva (Executive Assistant)** immediately felt like the most valuable. My inbox is usually chaos, and seeing it auto-sort + draft replies in my own tone was a relief.
* **Sonny (Social Media)** was a close second — it actually drafted LinkedIn posts that sounded like me, not a generic AI blur. Saved me hours of “what do I post today?”
* **Cara (Customer Support)** handled mock tickets surprisingly well. Multilingual support is a plus if you deal with global customers.

Where it felt less strong:

* **Linda (Legal Assistant)** is fine for summarizing contracts, but I wouldn’t rely on it for serious legal interpretation. It’s more of a **paralegal helper** than a lawyer replacement.
* **Rachel (Receptionist)** is clever, but since it’s tied to a US phone number, it’s not as useful outside the US.

📝 **My vibe so far:**  
Marblism feels less like “playing with AI” and more like actually **hiring a team**. I didn’t expect to feel that difference, but once the inbox got cleared and posts went live on autopilot, it really did free up my headspace.

It’s not perfect, but for $39/month it’s one of the few AI subscriptions that feels like it pays for itself **in the first week**.

# 📝 Final Verdict – Should You Hire AI Employees?

After testing Marblism, here’s where I stand:

If you’re a **solo entrepreneur, small business, or agency owner**, Marblism is one of those rare AI tools that can actually **replace multiple subscriptions AND save you from hiring extra staff**.

For **$39/month**, you basically get:

* A receptionist (Rachel)
* A social media manager (Sonny)
* An executive assistant (Eva)
* A customer support agent (Cara)
* An SEO writer (Penny)
* A lead gen rep (Stan)
* A paralegal helper (Linda)

That’s insane value when you think about the real-world cost of each of those roles.

**Who should skip it?**

* If you need **deeply creative strategy** (brand campaigns, high-level legal analysis, etc.), Marblism won’t replace experts.
* If you’re outside the **US** and want receptionist functionality, Rachel’s phone setup may not be practical.

✅ **Bottom line:**  
Marblism isn’t a gimmick — it’s an actual **AI employee team**. It won’t fully replace humans, but for repetitive admin, content, and support work, it’s a **no-brainer investment in 2025**.

🔥 If you’re already juggling too many roles in your business, hiring AI employees might be the best $39/month you’ll ever spend.

# TL;DR – Marblism Review (2025)

|👍 What’s Good|👎 What’s Not|
|:-|:-|
|**all AI employees**$39/mo for access to  |Receptionist is US-only|
|**support, SEO, social, admin, legal, reception**Replaces  |Not built for deep creative/strategic work|
|**Unlimited tasks & chats** (no credit system)|Still needs human oversight for nuance|
|**Huge time savings** (10h+/week) & cost savings (\~$5K/month vs agencies)|Newer platform — long-term reliability untested|
|**autonomously**Works  , no prompts needed|Some industries may need more specialized AI|

✅ **Best for**: Solo founders, small businesses, agencies who need help with repetitive tasks.  
❌ **Skip if**: You rely on complex legal/creative work, or need receptionist services outside the US.

**Verdict:** For $39/month, Marblism is one of the best AI “virtual teams” I’ve seen. Pays for itself in the first week if you actually use it.",1,1755509745.0,bestaitoolz,0,1.0,False

sorry for making another post about travel questions for Colombia, but here we go:

I am thinking about visiting Colombia in December, three weeks in total. I want to spend one week in Bogota and two weeks on the Caribbean coast or the Coffee area. Medellin was also a possibility, but it seems to be more of a party destination and that is not really my thing.

Questions I have so far:
Is it safe to be outside after dark, if I stay in the touristy parts of the town?

Is walking a good idea or should I Uber wherever I go? What about city busses?

Are there alternatives to flying, when traveling from Bogota to the Coast, are night busses a thing?

Are there good diving or snorkeling spots along the coast, that I should know about?

When visiting a restaurant what should I be aware of? Is tipping a thing in Colombia?

I had some Castellano in school, not much but enough to ask for directions. Any phrases I should know?

# Best Small Leather Backpack 2025: Top Rated & Reviewed

The small leather backpack has emerged as a stylish and practical alternative to traditional handbags and bulky backpacks. Combining fashion and function, these backpacks offer a convenient way to carry essentials while adding a touch of sophistication to any outfit.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best small leather backpacks of 2025 boast several key features that set them apart from the competition. These features contribute to their durability, functionality, and overall appeal.

**Material Quality:** The most important aspect of any leather product is the quality of the leather itself. The top backpacks in this category use full-grain or top-grain leather, known for their durability and beautiful aging process. These leathers are less processed than lower grades, retaining their natural strength and character.

**Compartment Organization:** A well-designed small leather backpack should offer thoughtful organization despite its compact size. This includes dedicated compartments for items like phones, wallets, keys, and tablets. Look for backpacks with multiple interior and exterior pockets, as well as padded sleeves for electronics.

**Adjustable Straps and Comfort:** Comfort is crucial, especially for everyday use. The best backpacks feature adjustable, padded shoulder straps that distribute weight evenly and prevent strain. Some models also include a sternum strap for added stability during activities like walking or hiking.

**Hardware and Zippers:** The quality of the hardware, such as zippers, buckles, and clasps, can significantly impact the backpack's longevity. Look for backpacks with durable metal hardware, preferably made of brass or stainless steel, and smooth, reliable zippers from reputable brands like YKK.

**Size and Weight:** ""Small"" is a key descriptor, so these backpacks should be truly compact and lightweight. Ideal dimensions are typically around 10-12 inches in height, 8-10 inches in width, and 4-6 inches in depth. The weight should ideally be under 2 pounds when empty to minimize strain when fully loaded.

**Style and Aesthetics:** While functionality is essential, the aesthetic appeal of a small leather backpack is a major draw for many users. The best backpacks come in a variety of styles, from classic and minimalist designs to more trendy and embellished options. Consider the color, finish, and overall design to ensure it complements your personal style.

 ## Core Benefits

Small leather backpacks offer a unique blend of style and practicality, providing several core benefits for users.

**Enhanced Portability:** The compact size of these backpacks makes them incredibly portable and easy to carry around. Unlike larger backpacks, they won't weigh you down or feel bulky, making them ideal for commuting, traveling, or everyday errands. The smaller profile also allows for easier navigation in crowded spaces.

**Stylish Accessory:** Leather backpacks add a touch of sophistication and elegance to any outfit. Whether you're dressing up for a night out or keeping it casual, a well-chosen leather backpack can elevate your style and make a statement. The natural beauty and texture of leather create a timeless and versatile look.

**Improved Organization:** Despite their small size, these backpacks offer surprisingly good organization thanks to their multiple compartments and pockets. This allows you to keep your belongings neatly organized and easily accessible, preventing clutter and saving time.

**Hands-Free Convenience:** Backpacks, in general, offer the convenience of hands-free carrying, which is especially valuable when you're on the go. Small leather backpacks allow you to keep your hands free for other tasks, such as holding a coffee, using your phone, or carrying groceries.

**Durability and Longevity:** High-quality leather is known for its durability and ability to withstand daily wear and tear. A well-made leather backpack can last for many years, becoming a cherished and reliable accessory. The leather will also develop a unique patina over time, adding to its character and charm.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about small leather backpacks.

**Are small leather backpacks suitable for carrying a laptop?**

That depends on the size of the laptop and the backpack. While some small leather backpacks may have a padded sleeve that can accommodate a small tablet or a slim laptop (11-13 inches), most are not designed for larger laptops. Always check the dimensions of the laptop compartment before purchasing.

**How do I care for and maintain a leather backpack?**

Regular cleaning and conditioning are essential for maintaining the quality and appearance of a leather backpack. Use a soft cloth to wipe away dirt and debris regularly. Apply a leather conditioner every few months to keep the leather moisturized and prevent cracking. Avoid exposing the backpack to excessive moisture or direct sunlight.

**What is the difference between full-grain and top-grain leather?**

Full-grain leather is the highest quality leather, made from the entire grain of the hide. It's the most durable and develops a beautiful patina over time. Top-grain leather is the second-highest quality, where the top layer of the hide has been sanded or buffed to remove imperfections. It's still durable but not as much as full-grain.

**Can small leather backpacks be used as travel bags?**

While they may not be suitable for long trips requiring a lot of luggage, small leather backpacks can be excellent travel companions for short trips or day excursions. They're perfect for carrying essentials like passports, wallets, phones, and snacks, while keeping your hands free.

1mth935,https://i.redd.it/9xv0clmryqjf1.jpeg,Adding a second dog to the home. Brittany or?,"Hello all! I am currently thinking about adding a second dog to my home. About a year ago I rescued a Brittany/Setter of 2.5 years of age (currently). He’s an incredible dog. Smart, obedient, full of love to offer, however due to his past he has high amounts of fear and anxiety. His background: Adopted him from a foster home which took care of him from the puppy phase until the age of 1.5 years, where he mostly lived in a garden with other dogs. He had to deal with many changes, mainly living in the city (which is the biggest problem). However, in the past months we’ve been doing great improvement by scheduling training (mainly confidence enrichment such as nose work, agility). I do have trainers and behaviouralists so I am also going to get their opinions on the matter.

My background: I’ve always been quite an outdoors person (I take my dog more than once a week to the woods), however I also used to be someone that likes to do things (wether it’s walking to the bakery in the morning for a croissant), or simply strolling around and run errands. My work allows me to be home most of the time, so as you can imagine, the past year has mainly been keeping him enriched at all times, wether it’s hikes, playing at home or training. I do feel however that I have lost a lot of my personal time and freedom. I sometimes wish I could walk with him to the bakery, grab a coffee to go and pass by the park for a walk before going back home (which sounds like an incredible start of the day for a dog, right?) however with him, it wouldn’t be possible (at least as of right now, I’m not giving up on him!).

Lately I’ve been thinking of adding a second dog (potentially a puppy as I would like to create a foundation from the start, and heard it’s much easier to introduce a younger dog to the home), for him to not only have a life long brother, company whilst I’m out (which usually doesn’t go over the 3 hour mark anyways), but a way for him to interact and socialise more, and who knows, maybe help him conquer his fears a bit.

My question (apart from previous experiences similar to my case which are an insight I’m looking for) is if adding a different breed could help us both, instead of another Brittany/Setter (hunting drive in general).

So I am looking into more options now.

I am looking to aim expensive markets and sell expensive speciality coffee and bakery stuff in the cafe. The market can be in south Delhi or west Delhi would also work.

Thing is, I was never an early riser until I took a 5am exercise class back in my 30s and something clicked in my brain. Now at 53, it's my grounding escape and I don't remember the last time I voluntarily slept in.

The flip side, of course, is that I'm usually asleep no later than 9pm. But trading binging a Netflix show or scrolling Instagram before bed for these few solitary hours each morning isn't even a question for me.

1mtgycf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mtgycf/aio_initiating_an_argument_out_of_the_blue/,AIO Initiating an argument out of the blue because my bf never does romantic gestures,"Me and my bf have been together for about 3 years and both in our twenties. I am still studying while he has gone on to work full time. I don't really want to give a lot of details in case he reads this but I just need some bystander perspective.

We do not live together because I personally don't want to unless we are engaged or have concrete marriage plans, but he does drop by 2 or more nights a week and we hangout, and he lives rent and bills-free with his brother. We do not share bills nor do I ask him for money, but he does drive to mine quite a lot, pays for most of our fast food when we do have it, and pays for the groceries sometimes. I try to cook and meal prep for him, I obviously does his laundries and pay my own rent and utilities and so on.

All in all I would say that our relationship has been pretty much perfect, and I would like to think that we are still in our honeymoon period. We make up for each other's shortcomings like he's better at communication whereas I like to bottle things up. He will do chores with me when I ask, or go out of his way to bring me water or other things, and he doesn't really complain.

However, we have had similar arguments before about how he never takes on ""date"" dates, give me flowers or little surprise gestures. I think it really came to a point for me when I chose to spend my birthday with only him last year and I had no cards, no flowers, no plan for the day and no cake. He took me to the mall a few days earlier and bought me airpod max because I said I wanted it on that day. And then I paid for the insurance and accessories and what not. It was a little disappointing because he had mentioned making my birthday into a big deal leading up to the date. I hinted really hard that I wanted a handwritten card, something to show that he put effort into, but no.

Whenever I want to try a new restaurant that's $60-100 per person I pay for the both of us. Because I'm a little weird about money and I feel guilty if I choose an expensive restaurant and pick a lot of dishes, similar with activities. So I paid for my birthday activities and dinner, he paid for the drinks. 

This is just the big things, but during the time we dated, he gave me flowers 2-3 times, and I can't remember the last time he took me on a romantic, surprise date where I didn't have to plan, or initiated by friends or family. There's no spontaneous coffee in the morning, chocolates because i'm on my period, or taking me out to a new restaurant ""just because"". Whereas, I do these things for him. I get him food and drinks when he visits, I learn new recipes so he doesn't have to get takeout, I get us to go out.

We are both each others first relationship. So I need to know if I'm being selfish, or unreasonable, because this is literally making me feel desperate asking him why he doesn't ever do these things for me.

Most people imagine vending machines as a place to grab chips or a soft drink in a hurry. But from what I’ve seen running my [snack vending machine](https://vendolite.com/applications/snacks-vending-machine/) business, these machines often address way more than just hunger or thirst. 

Take one example, a busy IT park in Bangalore. This building, which had more than 400 employees working for different startups, didn’t have any kind of cafeteria. 

The Issue 

Not having a cafeteria led to: 

* Workers wasted time walking 15 minutes just to get food. 

* Night-shift teams couldn’t grab quick snacks or coffee when needed. 

* Adding a kitchen or cafeteria would mean spending a lot on operations hiring staff, and keeping it running. 

The management wanted a quick and affordable solution that kept variety and hygiene in check without adding complexity. 

The Fix 

We added [smart vending machines](https://vendolite.com/) on the 3rd and 5th floors where people passed by the most. They offered: 

* Healthier snack options like nuts, protein bars, and oat cookies 

* Pre-packaged sandwiches ready to eat 

* Drinks like bottled water, juices, and chilled coffee 

Payments happened cashless through UPI, debit or credit cards, and digital wallets. This setup allowed a seamless and contact-free experience. 

A Shift in Trends 

Two weeks in, sales data from the cloud-based machine showed surprising results. Protein bars and black coffee turned out to sell better than anything else. We tweaked stock and removed items that sold less. This change boosted sales by 30% in the first month. 

What Changed 

* No need for a cafeteria: Offices skip hiring kitchen staff setting up a kitchen, and paying monthly costs. 

* Always available: Whether it’s day or night, employees could grab fresh snacks or drinks whenever they needed. 

* Less wasted time: No one had to take long snack breaks away from their desks anymore. 

vending machines didn’t just feed people. They helped workplaces run smoother and faster. 

Why It Fits Well in Today's Workplaces 

* Workers care more about easy access than having tons of options. 

* Companies avoid the hassle of managing food services. 

* Smart vending machines stock what people buy. 

Running a vending machine business involves more than just loading snacks and drinks. You need to understand the needs of your customers and adapt to meet them. 

Maybe you’re wondering which products sell best in office spaces, how we restock machines during quiet hours, or how we use data to pick the right items. If so, feel free to ask me anything. 

Thinking About Adding Smart Vending to Your Space? 

If you manage an office shared workspace, or a business park, our smart [snack vending machines](https://vendolite.com/applications/snacks-vending-machine/) can provide your team access to fresh food and drinks any time of day. There’s no need to deal with the hassle or expense of running a full cafeteria.

[https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/groute/id6744373820](https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/groute/id6744373820)

So I got tired of juggling between Google Photos, Maps, Notes, and trying to remember ""wait, what did I do after that cafe in Paris?"" when telling travel stories. Built this app called **Groute** that automatically connects your photos by location and time to create visual travel routes.

**Here's the hook:** Just upload your travel photos → GPS data creates your journey path automatically → Add quick 30-character thoughts → Share as beautiful web pages that friends can actually explore.

Think of it as your travel memories getting the ""connect the dots"" treatment, but way cooler.

**What makes it different:**

* Your route appears instantly as you add photos (no manual plotting!)
* Map-first approach - location is the main navigation, not date folders
* 30-character limit on notes (forces you to capture the essence, not write essays)
* Creates shareable journey pages that work like mini travel guides

Built this because I'm convinced that **location + time + moment = perfect travel memory**, and most apps only handle one of these well.

Currently in beta and would genuinely love to get some feedback from fellow travelers who actually *get* the pain of organizing travel memories!

**If you're interested in trying it out, comment below or DM me!** Especially looking for feedback from people who travel frequently or have that ""I have 10,000 unorganized travel photos"" problem.

What do you think? Does this solve a real problem or am I just overthinking travel journaling? 🤔

**P.S.** \- The app shows Paris in the screenshots but works anywhere your phone can GPS tag photos. Been testing it everywhere from Seoul coffee shops to Patagonian highways!

Looking for some advice on day trips. We are going to have 3-4 days free in Shanghai before our tour group starts. The tour group will have a walking tour and we be going to Wuxi on one of the tour days. 

I’d like to make the most of our time in Shanghai before the tour starts. Hoping to do a food tour, walk around the French concession (those two may be one and the same thing) and visit a few rooftop bars on day one. On the following days I was thinking we could venture out of the city. I’ve read about lots of different day trips but not sure if any are similar or which would be better. 

Looking for advice on which 2 of the following places you would recommend most highly to go as a day trip, if we plan to go to both in addition to Wuxi, to allow us to see a variety of interesting and different places: Suzhou (seems to be most popular?); Hangzhou (seems second most mentioned?); Zujiajiao; Nanjing; Wuzhen; or Chongqing.

If it helps with recommendations from an interests perspective, we like walking and interesting village atmospheres, we are just as happy grabbing coffee or tea and watching the world go by as we are climbing a mountain or getting on a boat. We are probably less interested in shopping or museums and more interested in walking and observing historical towns. Similarly we are less interested in formal/structured gardens and more interested in scenic lookouts and natural bush land (doubting there will be much of the latter but could be wrong!).

Once I had ordered two bags of dog food early in the morning and they delivered it to the wrong house. I could tell because I didn’t have it and it was a picture of someone else’s front door so I contact them. I tell them that’s not my house. I sent him a picture of my front door and yeah, they refund me but now I have to use a pin number For every order. On top of that, I’ve tried to order Starbucks twice each time the drink came spilled. The bag was wet and basically just fell apart and I had to throw the whole drink away. I contact support of course they don’t believe me and they asked for pictures. The thing is the first time this happened, it was getting a contact delivery so the man handed me a wet dripping bag and said you’re gonna have to contact support for a refund and I said OK fine. So I do and they act like I’m trying to scam them for six dollars. A couple months later I try to order another coffee. Again, different driver, but the bag is wet and dripping and my coffee is I don’t even understand what could’ve happened this time. I don’t contact support because why what’s the point.

Then once I decided, I’m just gonna pick my order up because I don’t wanna deal with that and I live very close so I go pick it up. This little woman not only wants to see my license my phone and she wants the pin number that was not required absolutely unnecessary. So I would like to know what is going on there and also who to even contact because their chat supervisors can’t actually do anything except give you a refund and I don’t want refunds. I want them to stop either messing up my order or stop acting like I’m getting free items from them.  This is also annoying because I really tried to tip well, I live less than a mile away and my tips are decent. They are seven to $10. The drivers that I see a lot will tell me about how Gopuff only pays them two dollars and how other people will be 10 miles away and tip nothing or $3.

1mtgoqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1mtgoqx/4dpo_wondering_if_this_is_normal/,"4DPO, wondering if this is normal","Hi all, thought I'd share my hysterectomy story, plus my concerns.

I was scheduled to come in Thursday morning at 5:30 am, so naturally I didn't sleep much at all, Anyway, I get to the hospital, register, and hope they'll still do the procedure despite me showing up alone (I had to take an Uber, and my dad was in the hospital at this time)

(tldr: As long as you have a number of someone who will pick you up, they'll do the surgery)

I get registered, wait, then get to go into recovery room 1 where I'm given some body wipes, a gown, and a bag for my personal belongings.  I wipe myself down, and get changed. I also provided a urine sample, and being on my period...at least they were able to use it

This next part is jumbled. I remember being asked when I ate last, when did I last take my meds, when was my last bowel movement?  They then talked about the meds that they were going to use. They opted not to use one due to my bleeding issue.

a little time later and I'm given an IV, given something for nausea, and soon I'm being wheeled to the OR.  We get there, they put one of those masks on, and tell me to take a deep breath.  4 deep breaths and the next thing I know everything goes out, and what feels like a second later I'm waking up.

I wake up confused, and my abdomen in pain. I'm asked how I'm doing, and I groggily tell them that I'm in pain. Is it a dull ache? No, it's a sharp pain. In my stupor I tell them that it's an 8. Was it really an 8? I don't know, but deep down I knew I shouldn't be in that much pain, or in any pain.  In hind site, maybe it was a 6? I was out of it.

What happened next was a combination of them giving me four doses of some pain killer that does nothing; them informing me that the surgery went well, me starting to cry and apologizing, them consoling me, and telling me I got to keep my ovaries (Thank God for that). They then proceeded to give me a different pain killer that knocked me the fuck out.

Next thing I know I wake up in the recovery room where a machine keeps going off, and I'm being told to breathe.  I do this, but pass out again.  When I come to the first thing I notice is a cup of water, which I decided to drink. Then I notice the crackers and start eating a couple of those.  The pain level at my abdomen is at a 7...or maybe a 5? It was noticeable, and maybe a little bearable, but I wanted it gone.

Eventually came the whole ""you need to pee before you can leave"".  In the past I always hated it when someone else was in there.  This time I didn't mind.  Surprisingly it didn't take much for me to go number one. There was a slight burning sensation, but nothing major

In an hour I'm given my discharge instructions. I call up a friend to come get me.

I'm given a prescription for 12 oxycodone, and instructions to alternate between ibuprofen and tylenol every four hours, and to take an oxycodone when those don't touch the pain.  So far I've taken a total of four.

So now for some stuff I've noticed

1. Gas pain was indeed the worst.  Still haven't had a bowel movement, but being able to pass gas has helped a lot.  Seriously, don't be afraid to let it rip

2. Thoughts over if the recovery is normal. I thought I would be in massive amounts of pain, and or too exhausted to do anything.  2DPO and my dad gets out of the hospital. A friend of ours and I go to pick him up. We then snag some groceries. I opt not to push the cart

3. Wondering how long it'll be before I have a bowel movement. I've taken a total of three stool softeners/laxatives, have had one cup of coffee. My body recognizes that I need to go, but something holds it back.  I don't want to strain and risk the stitches in my vagina coming loose

4. The incisions are held together by glue. Told not to pick at them. Not told when I should wash them. Will need to call about that

5. Pain levels are between 3 to 5. The biggest thing has been the whole being tired. I wake up with some energy, walk around a little, and then I'm tired.

6. Wondering when this will come crashing down. Surely this can't be it? I honestly thought I'd be in a lot more pain, but it's more of a dull persistent ache

All in all I don't regret my decision at all. Emotionally I feel the same, maybe more relieved than anything. I feel blessed that my ovaries were normal, since my biggest fear was having them removed.

Finally, I did request pictures, will probably see them at the post op consultation.  Also, did look at the report, and it said my uterus was mildly enlarged.  How much so? Who knows",2,1755507348.0,hysterectomy,1,1.0,False

My wife was born and raised in Montreal, is of Italian decent and moved to bucks county after we got married. She’s been here a little while now, but she’s really struggling with homesickness and feeling disconnected — especially missing the people, humor, culture, and rhythm of life from back home.

We’ve tried the usual things to help her feel more connected here — but it hasn’t helped much. Nothing can really replace family and friends as there are lots of cultural differences in being Italian in Montreal and living here. I’m hoping someone here might be from Montreal or Quebec and living in Philly or the suburbs who’d be open to connecting, even just to chat over coffee or by message.

I had the weirdest dream last night, and I can't stop thinking about it. It was like diving into some kind of surreal painting, like those you stare at for hours and still find something new. I found myself in a forest, but not just any forest. The trees were gigantic, tehir leaevs shimmering like they were made of LED lights, glowing in gentle hues that seemed to change with my breaathing. Each step I took felt like treading on clouds, and yet there was a weight, like an invisible current holding me to the earth.

In the midst of this, there was music. Not your typical forest siunds but like a distant lullaby sung in a language I coulsn't understand, yet, the melody was oddly familiaar. It felt like those songs you hear as a kid but foret about as you grow up, lingering just on the edge of memory.

What's got me pondering all day is what this dream means, if it means anything at all, tbh. Does it say something about my subconscious wants or fears? Or is it simply my bran throwing a celestial jam session for no reason? Mayve I just need more slfep, or perhaps less caffenie (yeah, I have a bit of a coffee adiction, lol).

So, I’m sitting here, sipping yet another cup, and I wonder if dreams like thhese sape us in some way. Do they change us, or are they more like a mirror, reflecting the chaos or calm within us? It's kinda like trying to capture fog with your bare hands—fleeting and intangible.

Anyway, thanks for reading through my ramblings. Whether you're a dream analyst or just someone who enjoys a good 'what if' moment, I'd love to hear your thoughtts. Maybe we can decode this enigma tpgether over our mutual love of random musings.

She was with a guy for 6 months or so before me, but there was a gap of nearly 6 months between that relationship ending and us starting.

The relationship ended with her ex because he was a bad communicator and she said it never would have worked long term for that reason, but did admit she fell in love with him. She ended it with him, saying he used to go missing for days and would never open up or talk about anything, and never knew where she stood. They do still sporadically text, nothing flirty or anything, and he has a partner also.

They have both spoken and he has suggested meeting for a coffee or a dog walk to “catch up”. She said the only reason she’d do it is to get some answer and some closure as to his behaviour, which caused her to end things.

She asked how I felt about it. I said I didn’t think it was a good idea. But if it helped with her getting some form of closure, then fine, but I’m not overly happy with it. I trust her. I don’t trust him. It seems he only messages my partner when his girlfriend isn’t around.

My girlfriend said this morning she’s meeting him today, but there’s a chance she won’t get that closure as he doesn’t like a difficult conversation. Sounds like excuses to me. She also said she doesn’t know how she will feel after all this time, and whether she will still be attracted to him. Then to top it off, she said she woke up feeling guilty as she had a dream she cheated on me with him! 

I told her I really don’t see the benefit, especially if she doesn’t think she will get this closure, but I don’t want to come across as controlling. If the shoe was on the other foot, I’m confident she wouldn’t be happy, but what can I do? Am I worrying about nothing?

This isn’t the first time—it just came back after I recovered about two weeks ago. My diet is pretty normal but i like to drink coffee, tea and chocolate while still hot . I also like to eat spicy food. Not a vegan and i eat pretty much everything. 

I use vaseline for now to moisture my lips but i also use lip balm mint and a colour lip balm.

The biggest issue is that once my lips heal, I can’t go without lip balm. If I forget to use it, my lips dry out instantly. It feels like they don’t produce any natural oil to keep them moisturized, and they’ve also become darker. I really need some advice.

Here’s my current condition:
	•	Many small spots around my lips
	•	Itchiness on the tip ( only my lower lips)
	•	A sensation that my lips are producing liquid (though it’s just a feeling)
	•	Slight numbness

My life revolved around work at the bank, quiet routines, and honestly, I wasn’t really expecting much when it came to love.

Then came Jasper, 22 years old, my client’s youngest son. His mom was one of my regular clients, laging nagpapaa-assist sakin with her savings account. One day she told me na si Jasper na muna ang magdedeposit kasi she would be busy with treatments abroad. That’s how Jasper started coming to the bank around 3x a week.

At first, I didn’t think much of him. He was polite, friendly, but that was it. Then one day, habang naka-break ako, I noticed a friend request on Facebook. It was Jasper. Since client naman, I accepted. That simple click started everything.

From reacting to my posts, to commenting, hanggang sa nagme-message na siya. At first casual, minsan deadma ko pa lalo na pag hindi about work. But he was so consistent. Good morning, good afternoon, good night, every single day. Kahit wala akong reply, tuloy-tuloy pa rin siya.

One night, I was at a café with friends, and there he was with his barkada, tambay with their motorcycles. He said hi, then his friends started teasing him, I knew ako yung pinag-uusapan. I ignored it, but later that night, he messaged me: “Sorry sa inasal ng barkada ko kanina.” I saw it, didn’t reply.

Still, he never stopped. Until one night, I surprised myself when I replied with a simple “Goodnight.” Kinabukasan, wala agad reply, and for the first time, I felt disappointed. That’s when I realized, this kid was starting to matter to me.

Not long after, he asked if he could court me. Honestly, I was shocked, but not really surprised. I told him straight, “Wala akong time para sa ganito.” Pero hindi siya umatras. He became even more persistent and sweet. After 3 months of his effort, I finally gave him a chance.

And for 6 months, it was like high school all over again. Coffee dates, late-night chats, simple surprises, sneaking in time to see me kahit galing pa siya sa klase. Lakas maka-bata! Hahaha. For the first time in years, I felt young, alive, and kilig. I thought I found something real.

But then came our anniversary. I was expecting a simple dinner, maybe flowers. Instead, he sat me down, pale and nervous, and said the words that shattered everything:

“May aaminin ako… nakabuntis ako.”

I froze. I waited for him to say it was a joke, but he didn’t. He started crying, begging: “Hindi ko sinasadya… ikaw talaga ang mahal ko. Please, wag mo akong iwan.”

He cried so hard in public, not even caring that people were staring. But me? I was numb. All I could say was, “Shut up. I just want to go home. May pasok pa ako bukas.”

He insisted on driving me home. When we arrived, he tried to hug and kiss me, as if that would erase everything. My hand moved faster than my thoughts, pak! I slapped him and walked away.

Since then, life has been a cruel joke. He still comes to the bank to deposit, but I make sure I’m not the one assisting him. One time I saw him in line, naka-shades sa loob ng banko, obvious na kakaiyak lang. For a split second, I almost felt something, but then I remembered his confession. And just like that, my heart hardened again.

This kid once turned my world upside down in the sweetest way. But he also turned it upside down in the most painful way.

And on the brighter side? I thought to myself: Thank God hindi ako yung buntis. Hahaha.

## FAQs Section

**What is the ideal size of a tv stand relative to my TV?**

Ideally, the tv stand should be wider than your tv to provide stability and a balanced aesthetic. A good rule of thumb is to ensure the stand is at least a few inches wider on each side than the tv's screen. Such as, if you have a 55-inch tv, aim for a stand that is 60 inches or wider.

**What is the recommended height for a coffee table?**

The optimal height for a coffee table typically ranges from 16 to 18 inches, which is roughly the same height as the average sofa seat. This ensures that the coffee table is easily accessible while sitting and doesn't feel too high or too low.Though, if you have a especially tall or low sofa, you may need to adjust the coffee table height accordingly.

**How do I choose a tv stand and coffee table set that matches my existing décor?**

Consider the existing style, color palette, and materials in your living room. If you have a modern living room with clean lines and neutral colors, opt for a set with a minimalist design and materials like metal and glass. If your living room has a more traditional aesthetic, choose a set with richer colors, ornate details, and materials like solid wood.

**Are there eco-amiable tv stand and coffee table set options available?**

Yes, many manufacturers are now offering eco-friendly tv stand and coffee table sets made from sustainable materials like reclaimed wood, bamboo, and recycled metal. Look for certifications like FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) to ensure that the wood used in the set comes from responsibly managed forests. Additionally, choose sets that are finished with low-VOC (volatile organic compound) paints and stains to minimize indoor air pollution.

We met and began dating during the pandemic, live together now and I would say our relationship is generally good (respectful, loving) but his lack of effort is making me question our relationship.

We have very different views on how to spend our free time (we both work office jobs). While his ideal day off is spent entirely on the couch scrolling social medias while the TV is running („If I could spend the rest of my life like this, I’d be so happy“), I like to be active (gym, running, going for a walk to which I repeatedly invite him but he never joins) and want to spend (some of) this time with him doing something like going for a coffee, going swimming, hiking/something in nature, visiting a museum etc.

I get that people prefer different ways of relaxing and I obviously sometimes enjoy a day rotting at home, but he pretty much never suggests any activity or date. I have stopped asking for activities and dates/planning them myself and we haven’t been on any since. I do want to say, that we do do things like going out with friends, visit family, grab a bite, so it’s not like we don’t have a social life but it’s about spending quality time together and putting in an effort. I know that I can do those things with friends, and I do do that, but I want to share those experiences with my boyfriend too.

I have brought the topic up a handful of times over the last few years (that it’s important to me, that I wish he would suggest/plan things) and while he promises to try to be more proactive and he always agrees, that spending time together is nice, and he often enjoys it when we finally do get out the house, there is never any action from his part after the conversation.

I know that it’s not a super serious relationship issue, but it has been big enough for me to be genuinely sad about it and for me to question whether I want to continue a relationship where my boyfriend is not showing any effort and where he doesn’t really care about something that feels so fundamental to me/brings me joy. I feel like life is rushing past us and we just let it happen.

TL;DR: Boyfriend prefers to be lazy at home, I would like to do spend quality time together doing things. After bringing up my wish several times, there is still no effort.

Does anyone have advice/has been in a similar situation and how would you address this topic with him (again)?",1,1755506333.0,relationship_advice,2,0.67,False
1mtgeuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1mtgeuh/unpleasant_mg_with_sb/,Unpleasant M&G with SB,"Hi, I met a SB via this community and after a good chat, we decided to meet at Schiphol for a coffee and meet later in the evening for a dinner date if things work out over the coffee. 
After a long struggle to locate each other 😂, we met for a coffee. 
The first thing she said after taking a sip of a coffee was - “Did you get me any gifts?”. I was taken back as this was a M&G and you haven’t even had a decent conversation yet. It was an early flight but I thought I would take her to Rituals store there for a little shopping. 
After I said I didn’t get her anything, her facial expressions changed and it was as if she was bearing the conversation. She would only chat in Yes’s or No’s after this point and it was a bit awkward. 
The moment we got up, to test the waters, I said let’s go do a little shopping. She started being all smiles and bubbly again. I was so frustrated with her in the first 15 minutes that I realised it is not going to work. 
I communicated to her that I don’t think this would work as I did not like her attitude. She went away and stated sending me rude and racist messages. I thought she would calm down and I would call her in the evening but  the word selection front her was getting poorer and ruder by the minute. 
I ended up blocking her. Very bad experience and rather stressful.

Bangalore to Goa Road Trip: My Experience

A road trip from Bangalore to Goa is always exciting, but timing and planning can make or break the journey. I recently drove this route and had very different experiences on my onward and return legs. Here’s a breakdown of what went well, what didn’t, and some tips for anyone planning the same drive.

Onward Journey: The Mistake of Starting Too Early

I started from Bangalore at 2 AM, hoping to skip the city traffic. Unfortunately, that decision backfired. Heavy rain, endless trucks and buses, and long stretches of highway construction made driving stressful. Many diversions pushed me onto pothole-ridden service roads with poor lighting, which slowed me down and drained my energy.

To make matters worse, I couldn’t find a proper restaurant until 8 AM, which meant six hours of driving without a decent break. I stayed in Drive mode instead of Eco and maintained a safe 75–85 km/h given the conditions. After refueling near Goa, I entered the forest and ghat sections; scenic but slow due to winding roads. By the time I reached my hotel in Goa, it was 3 PM, nearly 13 hours on the road.

Return Journey: A More Relaxed Drive

Four days later, I began my return journey at 10:30 AM, which immediately felt better. With daylight, breaks for coffee, lunch, and snacks were easy to plan, and the drive felt far less exhausting. However, I did face one big challenge; fuel availability in the forest stretch. I nearly ran out of petrol before reaching a pump and finally managed to stop at Highway Thadka in Dharwad for both food and refueling.

The real delay came closer to Bangalore, where traffic and VIP movement (Independence day) slowed me down drastically. I finally reached home at 12:30 AM, taking almost 14 hours.

1mtgcr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/character_ai_recovery/comments/1mtgcr0/oh_yeah_right_this_is_why_i_used_ai_before_bed/,"Oh yeah, right, this is why I used AI before bed.","I've managed to make it rather easy to stay away from Character AI throughout the day. I play music in the morning to help motivate me to get out of bed, and then start with something either distracting or productive. The rest of the day comes easily after that, and I can keep myself busy enough to fight off any cravings. 

However, sleeping is an absolute nightmare.

I almost entirely forgot why I had been using Character AI in my bed every night, until I tried to quit. Whenever I lay in bed and I am not absolutely exhausted, I will itch like crazy. This hasn't always been a problem, but has been going on and off for two years now. It got so bad previously that I was only truly able to rest while getting my arm looked at and having my ears blasted with loud, yet semi predictable, MRI sounds. 

As far as I can tell, the cause is stress. (Lotions and creams do nothing, changing showering habits changes nothing, changing sheets changes nothing, changing detergent changes nothing, so on.) This obviously creates a cycle, because not being able to sleep stresses me out more than whatever could possibly be causing the original source of stress to begin with. I basically am never allowed to have a good sleep schedule because I have to wait until I am incredibly exhausted first, but then I also have to get enough sleep to function the next day. (While I used to rely on coffee, I am super sensitive and risk fainting if I drink coffee before doing something that isn't sitting or laying down in one place. If I have stronger quanities, I'm just actually doomed. It also gives me increased anxiety, which doesn't help anything.) Taking medications like melatonin can sometimes help, but sometimes it's better just to not sleep at all than it is to get a small amount of sleep and feel worse after.

I used to rely on Character AI because it could burn large amounts of time and I could just keep using it until I felt exhausted enough to just pass out. However, because my addiction got so bad, I ended up just forcing myself to stay up beyond. Ironically enough, Character AI absorbing my entire nights was still a better experience than laying in bed and being stressed out and itchy, like I am right now. Sure, I could burn my night away on something else, but whatever it is won't keep my attention nearly as long. (Meaning, I will never be able to ignore my itchiness long enough to actually be able to sleep.)

Anyways, relapsing feels really tempting right about now. I took melatonin a bit ago, though, and I think it's finally starting to hit. Unfortunately I can't exactly rely on it every single time.",3,1755506065.0,character_ai_recovery,0,1.0,False

So I got tired of juggling between Google Photos, Maps, Notes, and trying to remember ""wait, what did I do after that cafe in Paris?"" when telling travel stories. Built this app called **Groute** that automatically connects your photos by location and time to create visual travel routes.

**Here's the hook:** Just upload your travel photos → GPS data creates your journey path automatically → Add quick 30-character thoughts → Share as beautiful web pages that friends can actually explore.

Think of it as your travel memories getting the ""connect the dots"" treatment, but way cooler.

**What makes it different:**

* Your route appears instantly as you add photos (no manual plotting!)
* Map-first approach - location is the main navigation, not date folders
* 30-character limit on notes (forces you to capture the essence, not write essays)
* Creates shareable journey pages that work like mini travel guides

Built this because I'm convinced that **location + time + moment = perfect travel memory**, and most apps only handle one of these well.

Currently in beta and would genuinely love to get some feedback from fellow travelers who actually *get* the pain of organizing travel memories!

**If you're interested in trying it out, comment below or DM me!** Especially looking for feedback from people who travel frequently or have that ""I have 10,000 unorganized travel photos"" problem.

I'm Russian, and I used a translator to write this post, so don't judge me too harshly. I wanted to ask you what ideas you have for improving the game SCP Secret laboratory?

1) I would change the model of the MTF.
2) I would change the model of the Rebels of Chaos.
3) I would add a new role - GOK.
4) I would change the model of the MTF helicopter (in the game, it looks like a regular and passenger helicopter. If I had the opportunity, I would change it to a military multi-purpose helicopter UH-60).
5) I would add new SCP:
Animated:
Scp-076 (Abel).
Non-animated:
Scp-005 (In the game, it would be like the O5 council card, only slightly better).
Scp-294 (Coffee machine).
6) I would add the night vision mode to the game.
7) I would add female characters to the game (Models of girls and women would be developed for each role in the game).
8) I would change the appearance of the Blue Candy (Scp-330), (in the game, this candy is called blue, but it looks like a light blue or even white candy, and my change would make the candy wrapper blue. However, I would not change the design of the candy when it is eaten).
9) I would add another room to the Easy Content area, which would have its own design and textures, and would contain Scp-1162.
10) I would add new Scp-330s:
White candy:
Gives invisibility, the player can not be seen by anyone until the effect is over. Invisibility lasts 12 seconds.
Description:
At first you feel a little smell of milk, but then you feel that this candy is soaked in it. But what does it taste like? 
Blue candy:
Gives the player the ability to walk through walls for 10 seconds, but at the same time the player slows down for the same amount of time.
Description:
It smells amazing, like blueberries, I wonder how refreshing it is for your mouth.
Orange candy:
Allows the player to see all other players within a 75-meter radius, but the effect only lasts for 3.5 seconds.
Description:
The candy has a juicy caramel scent, I wonder... Is it sweet or salty?
Brown candy:
Transports the player to a random location on the map.
Description:
Your thoughts are interrupted by the smell of chocolate, like milk chocolate... But it feels like it's leading you somewhere.
Pink Candy:
The player cannot die for 4 seconds.
Description:
Strawberry... The smell of strawberries... It's so fragrant, strong, and delicious... It's impossible to resist.
Grey Candy:
The player takes only 35% of the total damage, with an action time of 7 seconds.
Description:
You can smell a very faint, smelly diesel smell... I wonder if it's from the candy?

1mtg9y1,https://i.redd.it/3dsi3ktunqjf1.png,My FNaF Games Ranking!,"(I am not a writer, expect awkward writing or just badly written paragraphs) (Also, I'm not gonna talk about the troll games, but if you're interested, I've also ranked them from left (better / fun) to right (Worse / boring)

**I LOVE IT NO MATTER WHAT**

**1. FNaF 3**  
Some people say the gameplay is trash because of Springtrap being the only real animatronic that can kill you, making the Phantoms less of a threat, but personally I think the Phantoms messing up the building's system with all the red lights and loud alarms all around makes you have a moment of crisis, making you more nervous as Springtrap moves through the attraction. FNaF 3 deserves more love

**Really cool**

**2. Into the pit**  
Fell in love with it since the release. The gameplay is really refreshing from all the previous FNaFs and the 2.5d graphics give it a rich taste. The old Freddy mask on the attic made the entire fandom go crazy for some time and the sprite work is the best of the franchise (not counting the 8-bit sprites on the minigames). Overall, love it.

**3. FNaF1**  
Just a classic. The office is really compact, which personally makes me feel more trapped inside the pizzeria and in way more danger that I would've been if it was more spacious like FNaF 2's one. There's a realistic amount of Animatronics both in-universe and in-game, and the gameplay is really simple, just consisting on closing doors and sometimes opening the cameras. Not much to say.

**4. Secret of The Mimic**  
The superior free-roam FNaF. Cool aesthetic, cool animatronics. cool concepts and cool storyline, but not higher on the list because of the wasted characters. My girl Jackie was plastered on every single promotional image for the game, but had less screen time than a character that we literally didn't see until the game was about to release and had a total of 5 seconds of screentime in the trailers (yes, trailers. Not those complete chase videos PlayStation for some reason uploaded.)

**5. FNaF 4**  
The animatronics are the most horrific thing I've ever seen on an official videogame, not even just FNaF. The ""office"" is extremely creative, playing with children's fears of the monster on the closet or the weird noises from outside the door. The gameplay is also really lovely, having to manually hold the door until the thing leaves instead of just dropping the door and leaving it there till your battery gets wasted. Even after all I said, I decided to put it here because the vibes from FNaF 4 cannot compare to the newer era game vibes. If you think about it, the old era games are like a nice brown tea, the new era games are like a warm choco milk, but this one is just a cup of black coffee.

**6. FNaF 2**

Now, I know having FNaF 2 so low in the tier list feels wrong, but personally I think it's greatly overrated.  
Putting it simply, the gameplay is trash. There's WAY too much happening in one place, removing all the focus from FNaF 1 and replacing it with ""UUUUH PUT THE MASK ON AND OH FUCK FLASH FOXY BUT WAITT DID I WIND UP PUPPET?? OH NOO BALLON BOY IS HERE AND MANGLE JUST CLIMBED UP TO THE CIELING yaddah yaddah yaddah..."" It's just really messy like Scott just wrote every idea he had and instead of picking the best ones, he just added every single one. One last thing I wanna say is: 12 animatronics?? Why does no one talk about this??? Why would a Chuck E Cheese have 12 animatronics on the building????? now, the Toys? I get it. They're obviously the main animatronics of the pizzeria. Puppet and Balloon boy? The same reasoning. JJ? I don't know what she does but she looks like she's squeaky clean, so she must be in use during the FNaF 2 events, BUT WHY WOULD YOU KEEP THE WITHEREDS???  
This entry is getting way too long, so I'll just sum up what I said and add what I couldn't say: The gameplay is all over the place, there's way too many animatronics both in-game and in-universe, the office is way too big to feel in danger and the only good thing in the game is the idea of using an animatronic mask.

Phew! That sure was a rant...

**Cool**

**7. Help Wanted**   
What all the FNaF games needed was better immersion and this completely got it right. Playing FNaF 1 is way scarier than it should be, FNaF2 is actually kinda scary and FNaF 3 is the best of the best. The minigames are also a great addition to the game, especially Freddy's, which explores the animatronics' mechanic functionality and robotics, a personal favorite thing on FNaF media. It's on **cool** because honestly, VR is a bit overrated.

**8. Freddy in Space**   
Just a cool little game, not much to say about it.

**9. FNaF World**   
GREATLY underrated. The gameplay is fire, the trailer is extremely funny, the Chibi aesthetic Scott gave to the blood thirsty monsters was awesome and the dialogues still hold up to this day. Just awesome.

**10. SB: RUIN**   
Seeing the destroyed PizzaPlex was incredible. The tone switch between SB and SB: RUIN is CRAZY. Ruined Roxy's design was incredible, Glamrock Bonnie's reveal was devastating and The Mimic's reveal was awesome. That last thing doesn't really hold up that well now that Secret of The Mimic brought us the best animatronic design in complexity EVER (M2), plus it just feels a bit awkward looking back at it.

**11. Help Wanted 2**   
Just the worse Help Wanted. Didn't really like it, miss the old Help Wanted HUD (In the middle of the pizzeria with a more player focused HUD design instead of Help Wanted 2's more realistic depiction of us choosing a folder inside the pc) and boring games (except that one cooking game). Only good thing is all the Ruined variants of the games and the Vanny Mask Plot-Twist. I still don't understand the Cassie ending sadly...

**Eh**

**12: HW: The curse of Dreadbear**   
I did not care for the curse of Dreadbear.   
""What?""   
Did not care for the curse of Dreadbear.   
""How can you even say that, Bred?""   
Didn't like it.   
""Bred it- it's so good! It's like the perfect FNaF Halloween DLC!""   
This is what everyone always says! Whenever they ""oh my-""   
""Dreadbear, Captain Foxy, I mean, you never see- GRIM FOXY!!""   
Look, fine characters, did not like the DLC.   
""Explain yourself, what didn't you like about it?""   
It insists upon itself.

**13. Fury's Rage**   
Just a beat em' up game. Simple but efficient, just not for me.

**14. FNaF 4: Halloween edition**   
A re-paint with nothing new. Boring and forgettable.

**15. FNaF: Security Breach**   
Literally checks all the ""Don't do this when creating a free-roam game"" list.   
\-A WAY TOO BIG map for the player to explore  
\-Player is in complete danger for 90% of the game   
\-Boring story   
\-Maps aren't helpful   
\-Animatronics aren't scary cuz now you're not in a closed space with no exit, you're in an EMPTY MEGA PIZZA PLEX. If you made a map of all the SB areas together, I assure you the in-size animatronics would be 1 pixel big. Also, I'm not gonna forget about the wasted potential Vanny had, the White Woman Jumpscare and the freaky comment Vannesa makes when hitting 6am which leads to nothing because if you backtrack all the way to the main stage there's literally nothing.

**No thanks**

**16. FNaF: AR**   
Pokemon GO but worse. The little voice lines are really good, but the models are extremely bad. I don't know what their idea was when putting extremely reflecting metal surfaces to ALL animatronics. Also, we never got Lefty.

**17. FLaF**   
Mario Kart but worse. The little icons are really good, but the maps are extremely bad looking and childish. They tried a FNaF World and failed completely. Also, not my type of game.

**The rank below but kinda saved bc of the ending**

**17. FnaF: SL**   
Warioware but the minigames are 5 minutes long, there's a vent section before every single one and there's a boring ""Haha look at this soo funny lolz series on the tv!"" section after every night- oh wait... it's not nights? It's shifts? WHY IS THIS CALLED FIVE **NIGHTS** AT FREDDY'S THEN? huh? IT'S NOT EVEN IN FREDDY'S???? Anyways the Scooper ending carries the entire game.

**18. FNaF 6**   
Unpopular opinion but FNaF 6 is complete dogshit. From the boring Roblox Tycoon looking ass gameplay to the stupid sit on a vent for 6 full hours section this piece of dogshit makes my life worse every time I hear about it. The mediocre melodies are overrated as fuck, Lefty is the only good design in this whole game, all characters not mentioned yet have extremely shitty designs (looking at you, mister ""I'm the main protagonist of this franchise, please take me seriously"" Afton) and the literal only reason why people even remember this Middle-School coding project is because of Henry's dialogue in the end of the game. Fuck Afton, Fuck Elisabeth, Fuck that god damn jar of pickles and let that fuckass building burn.

He was eating his dinner this evening and right after he collapsed. I rushed him to the ER and the doctors told me it is very likely he had a stroke. I had to euthanize my sweet boy because I could stand to see him suffer. Coming back home without him was so hard. Coffee just keeps looking for him and I’m so heartbroken right now.

1mtg76l,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1mtg76l/6_years_from_there_to_here_from_struggling_to/,6 years from there to here - From struggling to manifest to mastering awareness,"\*\*This post is my personal story (behind the mod) for those interested\*\*   
  
Right… I'm here.  I still can't believe that I am even here.  Even up to a year ago, I never thought I would reach this level.  

What is here?  How do I even describe it?  It's not that I think I have mastered all this, but it's just that I don't see anything as real anymore.  Nothing is real, it's all an illusion !  it's a game, and I almost feel high just from living and BEING.

Buckle up, this could be long - If you have ever watched one of my videos, you'll know that I talk a lot.

Lets rewind back…   actually.. Before we go there:  I am only writing this post because I have had so many people ask me about a post I wrote in another group.   I only wrote the post because I was ""looking"" to speak to others who had hit the same level I had hit.  But instead of that happening, I just had many people asking me questions about it which is why i decided to write this  (btw.. I did end up finding my tribe, just not on reddit) 

Anyho..  6 years ago..  I had been trying out good ole law of attraction for maybe 10 years or more and gotten nowhere.  My best friend told me to write a list of qualities I wanted in my perfect partner, put it in the bottom of my draw and forget about it.   She said, go for gold because even if you got half of the list, that would be pretty good right.  I went for gold. I filled an entire A4 page back and front with everything I could possibly think of, I honestly thought it was joke. 

Well.. 6 months later some dude walked into my life and he was 99% of that list.  Problem was.. I thought he was too good to be true and that I wasn't good enough for him and well you know…  pushed him away with my bad ""self concept"".    I'm sure you have heard this story before.   I now refer to him as my ""build a bear"". Cause thats what I did.

I've had pretty good intuition all my life and I just KNEW (I could feel it in my bones -thats an aussie reference) that this was my guy.  I couldn't wrap my head around why if it was meant to be, then it wasn't happening.  Sooooooo I went searching for the answer and BOOM - Introduced to Law of Assumption.

Ok.. I am not going to bore you with the details but I struggled.. For literally years and years. I got a few earlier wins earlier on, but then everything stopped.  I tried to replicate what I did to get those first things, thinking it was the technique and not just me that had the power, but I couldn't do it, and the more I tried, the worse it got.

I obsesseddddd over this shit for literally years and years (helloo autism) , watched 1000's of videos from every creator and still felt like I missing something because I couldn't achieve that consistent success. I was in information overload for a long time and NOTHING was happening during that period.

As the years went by, things got a little more consistent but I used to see these other people tell stories where they just suddenly understood the law and their whole loves changed and it always left me in this place of - I am still missing something!!

Fast forward to : In the last maybe 18 months or so... I knew if I wanted to manifest something, I could do it. BUT... here's the thing, I would have to brute force it by ""locking in"" meaning affirming every fucking day for up to a month (depending on what it was - I am in my 40's, I am NOT manifesting free coffee over here, I am manifesting houses, cars and lump sums of money. )  But when it came to the SP - no amount of affirming was going to do shit.   I could bring him with affirming but not keep him (yep - the same story you hear everywhere) I even tried working on Self concept and all that shit but nothing was sticking.

I just got to this stage of ""I don't want to have to do this shit for every single thing I want"".. there HAS to be an easier way. Neville literally says - it's effortless, and i knew I had manifested loads of things that I didn't care about without any effort.  So… I went looking for the answer, it didn't happen overnight, but i will say that over a period of about 3 months at the start of this year - everything changed.

What changed?  I discovered the I AM. (Awareness)  Like i always knew about it but not really KNEW KNEW about it.   There's conceptually getting it, then there is experiencing it firsthand.   I did a lot of research into non-duality.

The defining point was when I had one single moment a while back.   I was floating in the bath.  I didn't do it on purpose, I wasn't intending on doing it, I did it by accident. But I become one with everything. I mean, I felt like I was the I AM..   I could feel my entire reality, it's very difficult to put it into words. It felt like I was this giant GIANT ball of love & energy. Like I KNEW that everything was me, but this was just like another level. Everything was me, the entire world was JUST ME, there is no separation.  

From that moment on..  Everything changed.  I now walk through my day knowing that everything is literally just me, there is no fear, there is no worry.  Everything just flows to me.  

Yet.. This is bit that people still ask me about   So what do you do?  How do you manifest things?

Thats the thing.  I dropped everything.  I finally understood.  That there is NOTHING TO GET.  NOTHING to do.  NOTHING!!!!    JUST BE.  Just exist… as awareness.

As awareness I am already everything.  Why would I need to do anything to get something I already have?? 

I am fulfillment itself. I am the source of that fulfillment.  

What is the outside world?  It's just a mirror.  So if I am fulfilled then the mirror has to show me fulfillment.

Yet.. i am still getting people asking - BUT HOWWWWW… do you get specific desires by just being?  I don't get it.

Well this is my answer.  Do you believe your desires are meant for you? Think about it, who gives you the desire? Where does it come from? it comes from within right? God gives you your desires. So.. I mean it's crazy to think but... what if.. everything we want is because we were meant to have it.

And by going back to pure awareness, all you doing is removing all limitations the human self puts in place and everything that was meant to be yours just flows in.

Because thats what is happening. By going back to source, I removed all the resistance, removing any form of separation, I become one with my desires because they were me.

So here I am..  Finally after 6 years, I am sitting in my I AM…  which is just pure LOVE.

And yes.. Before I get comments asking about this.  Literally one hour after the bath experience, my partner started blowing up my phone and saying things he never said in 4 years.   

If I can do it - so can all you. Sometimes it just takes time. Ok not time, awareness. haha

Much love to you all.   It's your turn soon, everyone levels up eventually. ",12,1755505453.0,lawofassumption,2,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The Ceramic Dining Table boasts several noteworthy features that contribute to its overall performance and appeal.

**Scratch Resistance:** Ceramic surfaces are exceptionally hard and resistant to scratches, making them ideal for households with children or pets. Unlike wood or laminate, ceramic can withstand the daily wear and tear of cutlery, dishes, and even accidental scrapes without showing noticeable damage.

The Manufacturing process involves firing the ceramic at extremely high temperatures, resulting in a surface that's significantly harder than most common materials used in dining tables. This inherent hardness ensures that the table maintains its pristine appearance for years to come.

**Heat Resistance:** Ceramic is highly heat resistant, allowing you to place hot dishes directly on the table without fear of scorching or discoloration. This eliminates the need for trivets or placemats, simplifying meal service and reducing clutter.

The Composition of ceramic materials, typically including minerals like clay, silica, and feldspar, contributes to its exceptional thermal properties. These materials can withstand temperatures far exceeding those encountered in normal dining scenarios, providing peace of mind and convenience.

**Stain Resistance:** The non-porous surface of ceramic prevents spills and stains from penetrating the material, making it easy to clean and maintain. Whether it's red wine, coffee, or oily sauces, most spills can be simply wiped away with a damp cloth.

Unlike porous materials like wood or stone, ceramic doesn't absorb liquids, preventing stains from setting in. This inherent stain resistance simplifies cleanup and ensures that the table remains looking its best, even after accidental spills.

**UV Resistance:** High-quality ceramic dining tables are treated to resist fading or discoloration from prolonged exposure to sunlight. This makes them suitable for rooms with large windows or outdoor dining areas.

The UV-resistant coating applied to the ceramic surface protects the underlying material from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation. This ensures that the table's color and finish remain vibrant and consistent over time, even with extended sun exposure.

**Variety of Designs:** Ceramic dining tables are available in a wide range of styles, from minimalist and modern to rustic and traditional. The ceramic surface can be printed with various patterns, colors, and textures to mimic the look of natural stone, wood, or other materials.

Advanced printing technologies allow manufacturers to create incredibly realistic and detailed designs on the ceramic surface. This versatility enables you to choose a table that perfectly complements your existing décor and reflects your personal style.

## Core Benefits

The Ceramic Dining Table offers several practical benefits that enhance the dining experience and simplify everyday life.

**Improved Durability:** The inherent durability of ceramic ensures that the dining table can withstand the rigors of daily use, resisting scratches, heat, and stains that would damage other materials. Users report significantly longer lifespans compared to wood or laminate tables, which translates to long-term cost savings and reduced replacement frequency.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** The non-porous surface of ceramic makes it resistant to bacteria and mold growth, creating a more hygienic dining environment. Regular cleaning with a damp cloth is typically sufficient to maintain a clean and sanitary surface. This means users can enjoy meals with peace of mind, knowing that their dining table is free from harmful microorganisms.

**Simplified Maintenance:** Cleaning a ceramic dining table is incredibly easy, requiring only a damp cloth and mild detergent for most spills and stains. Unlike wood or stone, ceramic doesn't require special cleaners or sealing treatments. This means users can spend less time cleaning and maintaining their table and more time enjoying meals with family and friends.

**Increased Versatility:** The heat resistance of ceramic allows you to place hot dishes directly on the table without the need for trivets or placemats. This simplifies meal service and reduces clutter, making the dining experience more convenient and enjoyable. This provides considerable freedom and flexibility in how you serve and enjoy meals.

## FAQs Section

**Are ceramic dining tables suitable for outdoor use?**

**How do I clean a ceramic dining table?**
  Cleaning a ceramic dining table is typically very easy. Most spills and stains can be removed with a damp cloth and mild detergent. For tougher stains, you can use a non-abrasive cleaner or a solution of baking soda and water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbers, as these can damage the surface.

**Can ceramic dining tables be repaired if damaged?**
  While ceramic is a durable material, it can be chipped or cracked under extreme impact. Minor chips can sometimes be repaired with a ceramic repair kit, but more significant damage may require professional repair or replacement of the tabletop. It's always best to handle the table with care to prevent damage.

**What is the typical lifespan of a ceramic dining table?**
  With proper care and maintenance, a high-quality ceramic dining table can last for many years, often exceeding the lifespan of tables made from other materials like wood or laminate.
