1iptbv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1iptbv4/it_feels_that_not_having_instagram_is_a/,It feels that not having Instagram is a deal-breaker. Got unmatched,"So 28M living in Singapore. 

I think not having an instagram account with photos is such a big red flag to girls. I don't disagree with their viewpoint as they want to understand who you are (like watching a movie trailer before the movie) but at the same time I don't have any solution to this.

Options:

1. Be honest - say I am on detox since years (this cuts down girl by a lot, and in Singapore I already don't get lots of matches). Although I have never really liked taking photos or seeing others' life, so I just have a ghost town profile. 50 close friends followers. 0 photos

2. Create an instagram suddenly at 28 year old. I can get 100-150 followers as I have lost contact with many people from the past. But I won't get good amount of likes tbh (20 max) . It would be super awkward 



Here's a recent interaction of me getting unmatched randomly.

\- She swiped on me (rather than me swiping on her first)

\- We had a good connect for 2 days even making coffee plans and lunch plans

\- She asked for insta and I did not have an active insta so the convo went dormant

\- She suggested a date for meetup. Asked for my mobile number. Then proceeded to unmatch me. She is not a scammer btw

1iptbor,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1iptbor/my_weird_migraine_pattern_and_regimen/,My weird migraine pattern and regimen,"[Australia. First time poster. New to Reddit.]

Hello :)

Diagnosed migraine sufferer. Young adult, male. On a preventer, twice a day (propranolol 40mg), has been a life saver.

But when I do get one, they're never the same. Some can range from a mild headache, up to a severe throbbing migraine with nausea/vomiting. Often I'll get 'stinging' following over-sleep or change in regular sleep-pattern. Sometimes caffeine withdrawal. Other times heat, stress or dehydration.

I find what works for me, apart from trying to wait it out and closing my eyes and resting if I can, is any one or more of the following:

•Cold pack (such as icy bag of peas) on forehead.
•Head, neck and eye muscle exercises and relaxation techniques.
•Drinking a cup of coffee and lots of water.
•Reducing eye strain, such as screen use and harsh artificial lighting.
•Taking a tablet of cyproheptadine (less severe headaches/before bed/breakfast).
•Taking a tablet of metoclopramide (first tab and for nausea, but 30min before food or 2 hours after food).
•Taking a tablet of eletriptan (more severe headaches or for quicker relief or to avoid drowsiness from the cypro such as work day or evening recreation).

Would love similar stories/can relate? Feedback? Suggestions? Any thoughts?

1ipt94t,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1ipt94t/are_we_damned_to_be_alone_dating_a_neurotypical/,Are we damned to be alone? dating a neurotypical woman,"I am a 32 year old autistic male. I was diagnosed 2 years ago, with Autism Level 1, but I prefer Aspergers.

I have been dating a neurotypical woman for the past 4 years, she is 2 years older than me. I actually was diagnosed because her sister´s boyfriend is an Aspie, diagnosed young, and we are so alike in many things, so I went with the professional and diagnosed me. It didn´t made live easy for us do.

Instead of understanding me better now, she just doesn´t put any efort into the relation. Constantly tired that I take almost everything literally, that I don´t like going to places with loud noises and lots of lights. I have make improvements, I force myself to be social, she has a group of friends who like to hang out every 2-3 weeks, get drunk, loud music, yelling, gossip, smoking, I have adapted, for an aspie and introverted, very well, I follow conversations, I make jokes, I talk to everybody, then I need the next day for me alone. She doesn´t give value to that. 

I am an architect, she is a painter, I constantly want to talk about design, history of architecture, art, painting techniques with her, share with is common to our professions, she prefers gossip, tik tok, more gossip about celebrities, wich I could not give a dime.

More than this, she wants to have kids, but not with me. Because she is afraid that it would be an autistic kid, like me, but worst, someone in level 3, she says that she prefers to have an abortion before having a son of my mine. She also says that I don´t have a ""paternal instinct"", so I went and got myself a vasectomy last year.

I constantly want to talk about the future, I want to talk about the relationship and where is it going, we live in a small town, there is a lot of crime, and few jobs, I want to move to a bigger city to build real buildings. 

Then this week, today actually, everything went wrong because I work too much. She constantly complains that we never go out, so I took her for a coffee on tuesday, wednesday we went to the movies, she was already with the flu symptomes on tuesday, so she ask me yesterday, thursday that we didn´t see each other. Well, today was valentines, I got a nice present for her, even if I don´t understand valentines, capitalism, same special date for every couple around the world, consume, consume and don´t ask, but the present was there.

Thing is, she passed me the flu, I went to work this morning, I tought I had my constant allergies to the enviroments, it wasn´t, it was her flu. I told her, that I didn´t feeled like going out, that we should change it for tomorrow. She told me I was unconsiderate, rude, that I ruin every valentines, that she doesn´t want to go out tomorrow, today is the special date. 

I told her that, she can get sick but I cannot, we fought more on the phone, then I went to leave her present at her house then drove back to mine. 

The thing is, I am tired, I am tired, I am just not good enough, she wants me to adapt to her, in every thing, but she cannot adapt to me, she makes fun of my stimmings, usually I flap my hand while focused at drawings, but I use two rings that can spin on themselves, so nobody notices my stim on public. She constantly makes fun of that, of my monotone voice, of my lack of knowledge of celebrities and their gossip. That I am obsessed with the Roman Empire, with architecture, with history. My special interest are a joke to her.

I have tried, so hard, for 4 years, to get along, to adapt to her world, the ""normal"" world, but is bringing me down, I drove tonight to my home, feeling the burnout in my neck, I am burned out, I am just tired, that I am never enough for her, and that I will never will be enough. 

This, was my 4th relationship in 32 years, I don´t think I can keep going, burnout has taken over. Not just from her, but from everybody, I think I am better on my own, alone, without all that masking, without all that trying to fit in. 

I just think I was meant to be alone here. ",1,1739592386.0,aspergers,2,1.0,False

Chapter 1: Preparations for SG60

The scent of freshly printed brochures and aged parchment filled the air inside the National Museum of Singapore. It was early in the morning, an hour away from the usual opening hours, and Ethan Chua Jun Jie was already buried in work. His kopi o kosong sat there, now cooled after the hours of an early clock-in.  As a museum curator, SG60 was one of the biggest projects the 40-year-old has participated yet—an exhibition showcasing the key moments of Singapore’s independence, complete with rare documents, historical artefacts, and multimedia displays. The government has spared no expense to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of the young nation.

He sat at his cluttered desk, flipping through a checklist. The museum’s main gallery was being transformed for the occasion, and every exhibit had to be perfect. His team had spent months securing rare artefacts, including declassified government papers from the 1960s and an original copy of the Proclamation of Independence. That’s not all, there were recorded and written interviews of the Pioneer and Merdeka Generations giving their thoughts on this big occasion, preserving their voices and marks in the Singapore Story.

A knock at the door broke his concentration, Ethan swung his head up to identify whoever it was. Mark Tan, his assistant, stepped in with a clipboard in hand.

“Morning, sir. The logistics team says the display cases will arrive later today. Also, the media wants to confirm the press preview date.”

Ethan rubbed his temple. “Wow, as if we are not busy enough…Let’s set it for next Friday. Gives us enough time to make final adjustments.”

Mark scribbled a note. “Got it. Also, Dr. Lim from the National Archives called. He says there’s an additional batch of documents we might want to include—letters between the British and early government officials. Should I tell him to send them over?”

Ethan perked up. “Absolutely. The more original materials we have, the better. Surprised the British Museum isn’t trying to keep these for themselves.”

Mark smirked. “Knew you’d say that. I’ll arrange for the pickup. Take care!”

As he left, Ethan leaned back, gulping the remainder of his kopi o kosong. The weight of responsibility sat heavily on his shoulders, catalysed by the sour and bitter coffee taste flooding his mouth, but he loved this job. History wasn’t just about preserving the past—it was about understanding how it shaped the present and adjusting the future. Adding on, the way he was doing it went beyond anything a Social Studies or History textbook could ever achieve.

Outside his office, the museum was a flurry of activity. Workers adjusted lighting fixtures, installed large display panels, and tested interactive screens. The Independence Gallery, where the main exhibits would be housed, was nearly complete. A team was carefully mounting a massive timeline of Singapore’s history, spanning from colonial rule to modern-day achievements.

Ethan walked through the hall, making mental notes. The Proclamation of Independence would go in the center, surrounded by key artefacts—founding leaders’ personal letters, photographs of the first National Day Parade, and even an old microphone used during the declaration.

Moving onto another section, glass display cases lined the walls, each carefully curated to showcase Singapore’s journey through the decades. Inside, neatly arranged under soft lighting, were relics of the past—old banknotes no longer in legal tender, bearing the faces of British monarchs, their edges worn yet preserved with care. Next to them, early identity documents and passports with faded ink stamps told silent stories of journeys across borders long before biometric scans and e-gates.

Further along, a section displayed ration cards from the post-war years, reminders of a time when food and resources were tightly controlled, a memory now shared by a shrinking generation of older Singaporeans. Nearby, a collection of handwritten letters and telegrams, some sent during the turbulent days of independence, captured the urgency and determination of a young nation finding its footing.

Ethan’s favourite piece sat at the end of the row—a meticulously restored Rediffusion radio, the very type that once broadcasted the historic Proclamation of Independence. He imagined how, six decades ago, Singaporeans had huddled around similar radios, enjoying the highs of music of the day, or listening as the words of separation from Malaysia were read aloud, changing the course of history.

It was a room filled with echoes of the past, each item a tangible fragment of a larger story. And yet, even with all these carefully preserved pieces, Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that something was still missing.

Exiting the section, he glanced at a locked glass case labelled ""Restricted Access."" Inside, folders of historical documents lay neatly stacked—artefacts of the past still waiting to be catalogued before they could see the light of day.

Unseen. Forgotten. Waiting to be rediscovered.

Ethan sighed. There was still so much to sort through, and his desk was already drowning in paperwork.

A curator’s job was to tell history’s story—but sometimes, history had a way of telling its own.

For now, though, there was work to be done. SG60 was just beginning.

Although they have traditional coffee drinks on the menu, it’s definitely a more trendy, “dessert” coffee - think syrups, sweetened foams, strawberry matcha drinks, etc. I got their cold brew latte not realizing they add Earl grey syrup to it. The Earl grey flavor overpowered any coffee flavor. It was a tasty drink but will definitely ask to omit next time.

As the title says, I am in love with my best friend of almost a decade. We’ve been friends since high school, and I realized one day that I loved him. This is quite a sticky situation though. . . I am going to try to summarize this in places of the story so it doesn’t take too long to write or read. It’s still a long story, so get some water and a snack, and get cozy. Please read through the full post before commenting or judging. 

Here it goes: we first met during our Sophomore year (2018) of high school in art class. We met differently than I know what you’re all expecting. The thing is, I was already in a relationship with my “high school sweetheart”; we’ll call him Ex. And Best Friend was talking to, and soon dating, Glasses. How we actually met was my other best friend was curious as to who our mutual friend Glasses was talking to. His ex was a bit of an ass, so she wanted to watch out for him. I told her that we had an art class together so Bestie, asked me to “investigate” Best Friend. I said yes, obviously. A couple classes later, and I see him. He was rude, whiny, complained to the teacher and students alike, and basically acted like a 7 year old. I especially noticed the way he talked back to the teacher when she asked him about an assignment he refused to do according to the guidelines. I reported back to Bestie whenever anything happened for about a week, and we decided we did not like Best Friend. 

Only a few days later, Glasses introduces Best Friend, and he was someone else! We mistook Teenage Man Child for Best Friend! Best Friend ended up being this amazing guy. He was cute, super sweet, a bit flirty, had the funniest laugh, cool hobbies, and of course he long boards. He caught my eye immediately. Bestie and I were relieved. We all, for the most part, became friends. Best Friend and I started hanging out more, and even sat next to each other in art class. Did I also mention that Ex was in art with us too? Best Friend even became friends with Ex. We all would hang out during and after school from time to time. Glasses and Best Friend broke up after only a few weeks, and all was well after a few more had passed. I hung out with Best Friend a bit more as we ended up living strangely close to each other. 

Fast forward to Junior Year, Best Friend and I are much closer, had more classes, and hung out even more. I discovered that Best Friend was a bit of a player, and I was starting to crush on him during that time. I felt like a bad person as I was still with Ex, though I no longer had feelings for him. Then comes 2020, and part way through the second semester comes Covid 19 and the Quarantine. I was struggling, so was the rest of the world. I was stuck in a toxic household and relationship. Quarantine ends, we all go back to school a couple months later. I get sick, get sent home only to discover I have pneumonia, and thankfully not Covid. Best Friend was the one of the only two friends who checked up on me while I was sick. I’m back to school, Bitch Friend yells at me for something stupid again, and I decide I’m done hangout with them. They weren’t real friends anyways. Ex and I start nagging out with Best Friend and his group of friends soon after. Something significant happened between Best Friend, Ex and I. 

Now it’s Senior year. I was told by my egg donor at some point to stop seeing Best Friend as she could tell there was something going on. Ex and I broke up for a few weeks during the late fall early winter partially as a result to this. I wasn’t too sure of my feelings yet though as I didn’t know what love felt like. During those weeks Best Friend flirted with me a bit more than usual. Best Friend was also in another situationship with a guy we’ll call John. I wanted to flirt back a bit, but it was so soon after Ex, and he was with John. I then had a pregnancy scare, stupidly got back with Ex even though I didn’t want to be with him for the better half of the relationship. Best Friend was mostly normal, a bit distant, and went right back to John. Ex suddenly dropped out of high school during the last semester of the last year, stupidly I stayed with him. Best Friend and I became MUCH closer during that time. Ex wasn’t super happy about that as he was the somewhat jealous and insecure type, though he hid it for the most part. 

Summer (2021) arrived, high school was finally over. Best Friend and I graduate without Ex and he becomes bitter and resentful. They had gotten jobs, and I was going to college. Ex was fired for failing his drug test which was unsurprising. Household becomes worse, I can’t handle Ex anymore, begin questioning if I ever loved him, began to dislike him and men in general, and even questioned if I was gay because I disliked men so much. I only trusted Best Friend. I went to a lake party with Best Friends and all his friends, and theirs and so on. I purposely didn’t invite Ex because he was a party pooper like no other. He was very negative, wouldn’t want me to socialize with guys unless he was around, even for school assignments, and just had a habit of bringing the mood down whenever he was around. Ex found out eventually and was obviously not happy. He didn’t want me hanging with Best Friend as much for understandable reasons. Christmas comes around, he crashes and stays the night without my permission, and I hated that night. I FINALLY dumped him after New Years, because I knew for I couldn’t handle it anymore. I was free to do whatever I wanted now. I got a job, went on dating apps, had little success, hung out with Best Friend a little less since we were both working. We were growing up, and slightly away from each other. 

The summer before I turned 19 (2022), Best Friend and I finally talk about something that happened between him, Ex 1 and I during high school. We then spoke about the fact that he had kissed both me and my Ex before. Yep, we’re all LGBT+, and no we’re not theatre kids. I never told him how I think about that moment constantly. We were alone at a friend’s helping out while they were away, and the tension between us was thick enough to cut with a knife. A couple months later, I met the worst mistake of my life. He tried to drive a wedge between Best Friend and I. I regretfully told Ex 2 that Best Friend was gay so that he wouldn’t freak out as he was much worse than Ex 1. Best Friend and I hung out anyways, but things became awkward with Ex 2 around. I also dumped Ex 2 after New Years for other reasons. Also another story for another day, and another post. Best Friend was elated for me to have left Ex 2, but acted differently when I then told him that I believed I was gay. He wasn’t as flirty, stopped trying to hold my hand, etc. It was to be expected of course, though part of me was disappointed. Why was I disappointed if I was gay?

It’s 2023, and Best Friend and I are still very close. Constantly hanging out, going to each other’s places to game, etc. Only, we held hands, called each other babe here and there, and even spooned. I ended up moving that summer though, all the way to the other end of the state we live in. Now, instead of being a few minutes away, we were 10 hours away from each other. We lost contact for a bit due to the situation that was happening to my family up north. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to share that story. Best Friend and I still make an effort though. We sent each other short videos and texts, we played our games together over the long distance, he told me about his pets and kept me updated on mine, etc. Now, all the way to the summer of 2024, a year after I moved. Bestie was getting married! I went back to my hometown for the wedding, and to catch up with loved one’s. I was at my sister’s place when Best Friend and I saw each other again for the first time in over a year. He picked me up by my waist and swung me around like it was a movie. 

I had to wrap my legs around him to not fall off. He placed his hands on my waist and upper thigh, dangerously close to my cheeks. Then he suddenly set me down, we talked, hugged, and then went inside after a few minutes. While we played games with my sister and her roommates, he leaned back onto my thighs to use them as a sort of cushion. I was laying down on my side on the sofa bed thing, and he was just a little in front of me. He turned slowly to tell me I was very comfortable, and snuggled into my legs. Sister and her Roomies looked at me like they knew something I didn’t. Then comes Bestie’s wedding! Best Friend wasn’t able to make it as my plus one, but he picked me up to drive me there. His jaw dropped when he saw me, and he told me I looked beautiful. Then the whole car ride there, he was leaning towards and looking at me. I had to remind him to keeps his eyes on the road. I’ve never felt so pretty being covered head to toe. 

A few hours later, and I’m back at my sisters. Best Friend arrives late at night with some drinks. We get comfy, smoke a few joints, and are sitting basically on top of each other. His eyes were on me the whole time, and at one point my legs were draped over his. We’re talking, laughing, doing our thing, when I turned away for a moment for a reason I can’t remember. I felt a tiny movement, and then an inhale by my neck. He had leaned into me so close that his nose was brushing against the skin of my neck. I turned and oh my god the eye contact. Our faces leaned closer, and then our friend walked in with her boyfriend, ruining what could have been. Tensions were still running high between Best Friend and I, and soon he had to go. He almost slept over, but Best Friend and I have hated Sister’s roommates dog since she attacked my dog. He left, and then we hung out again a couple days later. We talked about our mental health, the situation up north, and other personal topics such as a couple of his conquests as I call them. I don’t remember why, but he told me he had always thought I was very hot. Soon after, my trip was over and we had to say goodbye. 

Only a few months later in the fall, I was headed back up north due to the passing of a family member. Best Friend was working the day of the funeral and couldn’t be there. So, we met that evening at my sister’s to talk about the family member, and catch up on other topics. That night though, he stayed on the couch with me. At some point in the night we both woke up, and he asked me to cuddle. I was regretfully too tired to talk and missed my chance! Morning came, and we woke up. He said he was cold, and I agreed. He told me to come over and cuddle with him. We were cuddling close together on the small couch, his arms were around my waist, and at some point his hand slipped to my butt. He left it there for a moment, then said sorry, but I told him it was ok. Then my damn sister came in and flopped on top of us! While the moment was ruined, it was fun dog piling with them. Best Friend told me I was the only person who could get him to sleep around that damn dog. He had to leave soon for his family’s Thanksgiving plans. I was left missing being in his arms. 

A few days later, I was his plus one for his sister’s baby shower. It was there where I met more of his family, and led them all to believe I was his girlfriend! During the shower, Best Friend introduced me to family, bragged about me, and kept me close to him. He even did the K Drama romantic-swing-around-and-swoop-her-down thing when the male lead catches the female lead. He did that in front of his mom, sisters, and cousins. Though he accidentally swung my head into the cabinet which led me to tease him while his family was cooing at us and saying how cute. 
At some point we were outside talking to some cousins when he set his hand on the small of my waist, gently slid his hand further down, and left it there for a good 20 seconds. We slipped away after playing some of the party games, having a few shots, and impressing everyone with my spice tolerance. He even got me a dark green jacket when I said I was cold because he thought it would look nice on me, which it did and it was super fuzzy inside. 

We went to smoke some joints in the back where I saw all the stars in the night sky. There was little light pollution there and I began my old habit of chatting the constellations from memory. He asked which ones were which and I tried to show him, but couldn’t get a good angle just pointing. So I decided to be a little bold, and pressed my back against him, rested my head in the crook of his next, and then began pointing to the stars once more. We stayed like that for a good 10 minutes, snuggling into each other’s warmth while I charted the stars for him. 
Eventually we went back inside to his bedroom. I walked by him in the room, and he told me I smelled sweet like vanilla. I said it was jasmine and decided to be bold by asking him if he wanted a closer smell. I gave him my wrist and he smelled it while holding eye contact. After that, we watched cheesy horror movies and ate tres leches cakes on his bed. At some point, I can’t remember why exactly, he told me he didn’t want to make me uncomfortable since I way “gay,” but I confessed to him that I wasn’t. I just hated men for a long time because of my exes and other men in my life. He tensed up, and we continued to watch the movies. 

We got tired and he had to get up early the next day for a family trip out of town. I borrowed some of his clothes to sleep in, and we almost shared the bed. Our backs were against each other under the covers, and then he said he would sleep on the floor so that he wouldn’t fall off. We fell asleep facing each other, and woke up when his fish tank flashed back on at 5 am, which was an hour before the alarm lol. When we woke up the second time, he told me I looked like a Barbie. We drove to a nearby coffee shop and back to my sister’s in silence. There we said goodbye, and that he would try to stop by one last time before my flight. He wasn’t able to show. When I got back to where I live now, we even talked about getting married for his green card and moving in together. Like, we literally planned a future together. We talked about what kind of house we would have, what type of gardens, where we’d put the animals, etc. He said that in regard to getting married, his family wants him to marry me too! And he didn’t say no, only a not now because I was so far away and planning to go back to school and that he didn’t want to hold me back. . . 

And now to a few days ago. My friend and coworker was reading this after I showed it to her, and she got his number from my phone. She sent him a text telling him I have feelings for him, which I knew about. She sent it to him, and he left it on read! He has also stopped responding to my messages as well.

I woke up around 9am then my tita informed me na yung boyfriend ko nagpa deliver ng flower and chocolates sa bahay ng 6am! Hahahaha ang aga diba? Sabi niya February 1 palang daw kasi nagpa reserve na siya doon sa flower shop na lagi niya binibilhan. Mas excited pa ata siya kesa sakin haha super happy na agad ako kasi syempre kakagising ko lang tas napakagandang bouquet ng blue tulips, baby's breathe, daisy, and eucalyptus ang bumungad sakin plus yung favorite chocolate ko na kitkat na napakadami. Mind you, blue is my favorite color and yes, naka wrap siya sa color blue na wrapper.
Meron din siyang binigay na roses para sa mga kasama ko sa bahay huhu.

While I'm having lunch with my tita sa isang restaurant, a notification popped out. He sent money through gcash tapos sabi niya ""Happy Valentine's baby, chat ka po kapag kulang 😘"" hahahahahaha sugar daddy??? 😭

After lunch, I have an errand with my bestfriend naman. Habang naglalakad lakad kami, diba ang daming paninda na balloons, flowers, etc. As someone na parang bata pagdating sa lobo, nasabi ko ""hala ang cute may ilaw pa"" the next thing I knew, my bestfriend gave me one. Inutusan daw siya ng bf ko na bilhan ako ng kung anong ituro ko doon sa may mga paninda. Binayaran siya through gcash hahahahah jusko.

Dinner naman, kasama ko mga friends ko sa isang coffee shop to catch up na rin, my bf messaged me ano inorder ko at siya raw magbabayad. I insisted, kasi binigyan niya na nga ako sa gcash so yun na pinangbayad ko HAHA

Nag update na ako sakanya na pauwi na ako and tired na from all the gala. Sabi niya, daanan ko raw yung coffee shop na malapit sa bahay. I was like ""why? pagod na me"" then he replied ""I made an order, pick up mo po doon kasi wala delivery sakanila ngayon"" Pagkarating ko sa coffee shop, may inorder pala siya a day before Valentine's day ng favorite ko na blueberry cheesecake, isang buo acckkkk.

Pagkauwi ko ng bahay, nag vc agad ako to thank him and all. He just smiled, picked up his guitar then serenade me with my favorite songs. After non, he said ""Happy Valentine's baby"" then proceed to his speech telling me how much he loves me. Naiiyak ako kasi tangina ang saya ko haha I feel so loved and happy kahit malayo siya rn. Na appreciate ko talaga siya, mga binigay niya, mga pa eksena niya, lahat lahat. I was in awe, nasabi ko nalang na sana bembang naman next uwi niya dito sakin hahahahahaha 😭 charot

Ayun lang naman skl. Happy Valentine's day po sainyong lahat! :)

Imagine walking into work, coffee in hand, ready to seize the day with your startup goal firmly set in your sights. And then, BAM! You're greeted by a glowing, smug AI assistant informing you that it has efficiently replaced a significant portion of what you and your trusty team were doing. Ouch. Sounds like a plot twist in a dark comedy, right? But for many startups, this AI-driven drama is all too real.

**Are We Victims of the Hype?**
The AI Action Summit recently held in Paris served as the stage for leaders like Alondra Nelson to debunk some stubborn myths about AI. First on the chopping block: the belief that AI's sole purpose is efficiency and scale. Sure, AI can turbocharge productivity, but have we considered what—or who—it leaves in its wake? Nelson insists that AI should prioritize people over profit, a refreshing perspective that feels both urgent and overdue.

**The Innovation vs. Safety Dilemma**
Another common fallacy is the alleged tradeoff between innovation and safety, a narrative driven hard by the likes of US Vice President JD Vance, who urged countries to just ""build, build, build"" without fretting over safety like the EU does. Yet history, as Nelson notes, proves that thoughtful governance can actually fuel innovation, not stifle it. Why choose between the two when we can bind them together for better outcomes?

**Good Intentions Aren't Auto-Pilot**
Finally, there's the assumption that the benefits of AI are as inevitable as that pizza delivery you forgot to cancel. Nelson warns against this, asserting that positive AI outcomes require deliberate effort and partnership with democratic institutions. Without this conscious stewardship, AI can easily skew towards being a tool for the powerful rather than the people.

So, there you have it—a call to arms to steer AI towards enhancing human dignity and expanding opportunity rather than concentrating power and undermining democracy.

This is a PSA in the hopes that they will not receive any support or credit for what I believe to be stolen work. I do NOT condone any attempts to contact this person, and personally believe that doing so makes you far worse than the individual in question.

[ChemBoy1](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/ChemBoy1/mods?gameId=7286) has 9 KCD2 Mods on Nexus mods. 7 out of those 9 mods are uploaded immediately following a mod with the same purpose and content (See below screenshots showing upload order). I believe they are re-uploading these mods without crediting the original creator. Each of the pages include their Patreon and Buy Me a Coffee, which one may find scummy, if one believes these mods are stolen. I'll also mention that upon confronting them in one of their mod's comment sections with this, they immediately deleted my comment and blocked me. I would say it is suspicious that they would be so quick to hide my comment as opposed to defending themselves, but that's just speculation on my part.

Disclaimer that these mods are simple command line arguments, which are all publicily available. Whilst this evidence can show some very suspicious things, I am unable to 100% prove what I believe. It is technically possible that they found the same command line argument, made the same tweak, and happened to upload it right after another creator uploaded the exact same mod. I believe that happening 7 separate times is unlikely enough to conclude that they are copying the work, but draw your own conclusions. I will not be downloading any of their mods, and certainly not giving them any donations.

REMINDER TO NOT HARASS THIS USER. If you have a problem with it, simply do not support them.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ipt4k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ipt4k2/my_keto_story_so_far_1_month_in/,My Keto Story so Far (1 month in),"I’m new to keto.

Started about a month ago on Jan 11, 2025 after my dentist appointment.

I hate going to the dentist but maybe I should thank him because I wouldn’t be where I was if he hadn’t scared the crap out of me.

I have acid reflux and basically it’s eating away at my teeth. I have some soft spots.

So, the dentist tells me he can fix that, but you have to be on medication for at least 3 months before he’ll do the work on my teeth, like those protein pump inhibitors. He says acid damage to teeth is either internal or external. Either I’m sucking on lemons or drinking soda (I’m not), or the teeth damage is from acid reflux. 

I said, Yeah it's acid reflux (though I've never been to a doctor for it). I’ve been treating it with TUMS. (I know, bad). At that point, I was getting it maybe 2 to 3 times a month.

So, anyway, those GERD pills scare me. They make your stomach less acidic and it seems like you have to be on it for life. Hell no. Our stomachs are supposed to have acid in them (I’ve been watching a lot of Dr. Sten Ekberg on YT since then).

Anyway, I started looking up ways to combat acid reflux and two things I found: First, I had to lose weight, and Two, on YouTube I found this channel called Serious Keto and watched a video about Acid Reflux and Apple Cider Vinegar.

I now take ACV with freshly squeezed lemon and water every day and my symptoms have lessened in the past month. I drink it through a straw to limit contact with my teeth, and I rinse my mouth out after drinking.

In the past month, I’ve also lost weight, since from there I looked up more about Keto and decided to try it out.

I had vaguely heard about Keto from my relatives (they had bad things to say about it, no surprise, and yes, most of my extended family are eating SAD and are overweight).

But I ignored the bad talk about Keto and tried it religiously. 

I’ve mainly been eating pasture-raised eggs, red meat (ground beef, steaks), chicken, avocados, extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, Ghee, butter, kalamata olives, broccoli, romaine lettuce, red wine vinegar, pickles, cheese cheese and more cheese like hard cheese (Parmesan, Romano Pecorino), and Havarti cheese, sauerkraut, cabbage, escarole, low-carb tomato sauce (Rao brand), sardines, and fresh herbs.

I check labels, I avoid processed food and sugar at all costs.

I haven’t had any cravings for “keto desserts” but my husband wants me to make some using almond flour, so we’ll probably try our hand at that in the coming weeks.

The weight has been going down in the last month. My starting weight was around 170 and now it’s 160lbs. I’m female, 5’4” and 42 years old. The biggest difference is my belly. I’m no longer bloated and I feel GREAT.  My belly has really gone down. I don't look as overweight.

I also have really noticed no hunger between meals. I no longer snack. I just eat two meals.

Oh, and I’ve totally dropped coffee. I used to drink it every morning, just one cup, with creamer (the bad stuff with added sugar), but now I’ve totally cut it out of my diet. I really missed it on the first week, but now I don’t mind.

I’ve since replaced it with warmed up almond milk (I add cinnamon, nothing else) that I make myself from scratch from raw almonds. I never knew I could do that. I feel amazed at stuff I didn’t know.

But mostly I’m drinking water during the day, as well as water with a scoop of the electrolyte powder stuff from Dr. Berg. I’ve read I need to have Magnesium Citrate so I’ve been taking a vitamin for that.

So yeah I’m only eating two meals at 12:30pm and 5pm. No food after 6pm due to my heartburn goals to stop that acid reflux. I also work out every day for at least 20 to 30 minutes at Noon when I take my work break, then I eat right after.

I sometimes will eat breakfast around 9am and then skip lunch and only eat at dinner. I feel free to eat until I'm no longer hungry. I'm not counting calories, I'm just making sure my food is as clean keto as possible.

Some things I’ve learned:

Plan ahead. I’m having fun trying new recipes. I actually love cooking now. I even bought myself a new fancy carbon steel pan.

I’ve made cabbage lasagna, some homemade soups like sausage and kale, homemade mayo with avocado oil, homemade salad dressings, and lots of steaks in my air fryer.

I want to try making cauliflower crust pizza next. That’s this weekend!!

I also just purchased some bones from this organic farm place and I’m now going to try making Bone Broth for the first time in my life. I’m also trying to buy red meat on sale, in bulk.

My husband is freaked that we are eating so much red meat, but I keep telling him it’s healthy. I don’t know what else to say other than that. I’m not a scientist.

He’s not doing Keto with me, but he is going low carb. For example, if we have steak and green beans, he will have a side of corn or something else that I won’t eat since it has carbs. He’s definitely eating WAY less carbs than we used to. He’s no longer having pasta or bread.

I nag him about his cookie addiction though. He loves Keebler cookies, so I’ve promised to make him some Keto alternative cookies. I’m hoping that will help.

Overall, I’m really happy. I feel mentally more stable. I don’t have as many mood swings, especially before my period. I feel more focused and energetic during the day. I sleep well and I have noticed considerable decline in my heartburn symptoms. My libido has gone up, I feel less stressed about food and my weight. I feel sexy and young again.

My goal weight is 130 (which I weighed in college). I hope I can get there eventually, that would be amazing.

I’m also hoping my dentist notices I’ve lost weight the next time he sees me at my next cleaning appointment in six months (June). I will tell him that I’m not taking those darn drugs and instead I've found a healthier way to deal with my symptoms. If he refuses to treat my teeth issues, I’ll just find another dentist.

Thanks for reading! I'm happy to be here.",1,1739591951.0,keto,0,1.0,False

Our CSA has new pickup locations at the Coffee Stand in downtown Boulder and Jacob Springs Farm, whose farm stand also offers all sorts of meat, dairy, grains, prepared foods, and more. We are also offering a snacker box of veggies that are ready to eat without cooking or fuss! None of this is what we're most excited about this year though...

You see, by being a Friend, you're not only supporting local food, you're helping create a new way of living and relating to food.In this new model, farmers specialize while sharing  equipment and resources in circular systems, with one's waste becoming another's resource. 

They own their own distribution and processing infrastructure and new farmers are able to gain ownership in the system over time. Communities can be built around you these farms and community spaces, making real estate synergize instead of compete. Spokes to these hubs can be made in cities where other stores can't operate.

We starting the development of this collective this year with Jacob Springs Farm and you can help us make this vision a reality!

41yo, Female, 110kg 5’2”. Not taking any meds or anything at all except occasionally paracetamol and ibuprofen as required for pain, nothing relevantly notable to this issue beyond the pityriasis mentioned in body of text. 

Yesterday I noticed a little brown smudge on my big toes base knuckle, and thought it was maybe dirt/coffee - I was too busy to investigate. This morning though it is 4 times the size and spread in patches to the tip of my toe. I thought that was really odd, so tried washing the area and it doesn’t wash off, so wth is growing so fast? Is it a fungal infection?? It is absolutely nowhere else. I do suffer from pityriasis versicolour but that never appears on legs or feet and it’s a darker brown what is on my toe. I’ve not done anything different, been anywhere new or wore different shoes. If it is a fungus, how did I get it and do I use nizoral on it, too? It is not itchy or anything

1ipsy18,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ipsy18/struggling_to_move_on/,Struggling to move on,"It’s been really hard to move on from my ex. I know I’m young (17F) but I find myself really struggling to maintain my good academics and mental health. My sleep has gotten so bad that I don’t get a consistent amount, and I find myself so tired during the day unless I drink coffee to keep me from sleeping after school. I do the bare minimum when it comes to my assignments, and if I do go above and beyond, I usually turn it in late and lose points.

The breakup happened last year, at the end of February, but I didn’t cut contact until the end of September. We were a long distance couple, and we had dated for a year. I asked to breakup because he (16M at the time) had told me he needed to “breakup” with me and find a new “fake”gf to get his dad to stop stressing him out about our relationship. He said his dad hated me, and I didn’t want to stress that relationship further, so I believed him. Two months later, my mental health gets worse and I’m constantly anxious and insecure about him and his so-called “fake gf”, a girl I had told him I felt insecure about before. 

So I called it off in February, and was willing to stay his friend. I even started telling him about a new guy that was interested in me. But he got so jealous and blew up on me, so I forced myself to repress the feelings I had started developing and reject the guy in April. I continued to act like his gf, texting him I love you and everything. Sometimes it was okay. But most times I felt so lonely, and by this point we were really distant with each other. I constantly wanted to hear about his day, but he’d never tell me because he’d be too-tired after school. To make it worse, every time I tried to open up to him about my feelings, I was either brushed off or he’d yell at me through text about how stressed he was.

Since we were long-distance, I had plans of visiting him, but I started having doubts after everything. And then we had a pretty bad argument, and I tried to block him and get him out of my life. I failed in keeping that promise; I heard out his pleas and fake apologies, and believed in his promise that he’d make my visit worthwhile. That we’d be okay and that it wouldn’t result in an argument.

The month I spent out there with him were worse. He told me that he thought I should “hurt myself.” Through text, he acted as if he was traumatized by my behavior a year ago and would start acting like he was younger and only thought about us. I cried so much at night that my brother woke me up one morning asking why I was crying the night before. 

Admittedly, we were sexual with each other. But I found little to no pleasure in it. I didn’t find him attractive anymore, I didn’t find his attempts to turn me on fun or even remotely pleasurable. I felt uncomfortable, but I acted like I enjoyed it because I didn’t want to start a fight. And honestly, I think he felt the same way.

When I went back home, I found myself relieved to be away from him physically. But mentally, I still felt his presence even though we were doing no-contact for four months. I found myself angry constantly, and to let that out I had started to hit myself or throw a plushie at the wall. I’d cry myself to sleep afterwards. 

So, I ended contact. And since then I find that going through the day is a bit easier, but at night I struggle to sleep and my days are filled with tiredness. I recently got screened for depression and anxiety, and I turned out to be at a high risk for both. I’ve had history with depressive episodes in the past, before everything last year, but I’ve never really dealt with anxiety like this until 2024, during that whole time and even now.

I’ve left a lot of details out, and that’s because I don’t want to go into every little thing. I just wanted to explain my experience because I’m so tired of being like this, and I don’t want to continue to rely on my friends for support. I know that they’d always be there for me, but I feel like it stresses them out a bit too. I don’t entirely know where to go or what I should do to move on anymore, but I’m considering getting some kind of medication to at least help me sleep at night. My sleep has me feeling the most distress, because on top of being a good student, I have athletics, an internship, and work to focus on. ",1,1739591290.0,BreakUps,0,0.99,False

And then someone asked me asan ang resibo ko, sabi ko wala kayong binigay. Yung cashier na nag take ng order ko was there and she immediately dismissed yung topic about the resibo, I guess she was guilty na di siya nagbigay, I dunno. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Then I asked, hindi niyo ba ako pwedeng bigyan ng solusyon ngayon? Mag aantay pa ako bukas? Oo daw.

It looked like and tasted like a carmelizer, just a little bit stronger. I enjoyed it and the next day I thought I would have another, same outcome.

Here’s where things get interesting. I went to a different location a week or so later, ordered it again, but this time it looked different. Tasted REALLY strong and nothing like a carmelizer. I figured my order was wrong, 10k coffees made a day I can’t be surprised if mine wasn’t made correctly. Water under the bridge, so I tried again the next day, it was exactly the same.

I began to think that maybe they were just out of an ingredient, I will try the first place again next time. I talked with the broista about my experiences and he gave me the same order for free! That was super kind and very appreciative. I get my coffee at the window and it looked just like the second place I went to and tasted like it too.

As I have a dealt with a loss of hearing, cross-modal elevates my sense of taste. So I said what the heck, let’s order a mocha cold brew next time. I’ve never had one before but it tasted exactly as I remember the carmelizer cold brews tasting. Strong coffee flavor and that’s about it. Looked just like it too. 

Broistas, am I missing something here? Could I possibly have been given a regular carmelizer the first 2 times by mistake? If so, can I add something to get the carmelizer cold brews tasting like their less caffeinated little brother? Why would the mocha and carmelizer cold brews taste the same?

This is a PSA in the hopes that they will not receive any support or credit for what I believe to be stolen work. I do NOT condone any attempts to contact this person, and personally believe that doing so makes you far worse than the individual in question.

[ChemBoy1](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/ChemBoy1/mods?gameId=7286) has 9 KCD2 Mods on Nexus mods. 7 out of those 9 mods are uploaded immediately following a mod with the same purpose and content (See below screenshots showing upload order). I believe they are re-uploading these mods without crediting the original creator. Each of the pages include their Patreon and Buy Me a Coffee, which one may find scummy, if one believes these mods are stolen. I'll also mention that upon confronting them in one of their mod's comment sections with this, they immediately deleted my comment and blocked me. I would say it is suspicious that they would be so quick to hide my comment as opposed to defending themselves, but that's just speculation on my part.

Disclaimer that these mods are simple command line arguments, which are all publicily available. Whilst this evidence can show some very suspicious things, I am unable to 100% prove what I believe. It is technically possible that they found the same command line argument, made the same tweak, and happened to upload it right after another creator uploaded the exact same mod. I believe that happening 7 separate times is unlikely enough to conclude that they are copying the work, but draw your own conclusions. I will not be downloading any of their mods, and certainly not giving them any donations.

REMINDER TO NOT HARASS THIS USER. If you have a problem with it, simply do not support them. I have already submitted a report to Nexus including the same evidence I have provided here, as I believe this violates [Nexus Mods' File Submission Guidelines](https://help.nexusmods.com/article/28-file-submission-guidelines): ""Submission of existing user-submitted content without obtaining permission from the original author(s) of said content is strictly prohibited.""

* **Why it’s bad:** Blue light from screens (phones, TVs, computers) suppresses **melatonin**, making it harder to fall asleep.
* **Fix:** Avoid screens **1-2 hours before bed** or use **blue light-blocking glasses** and warm-toned screen filters (like Night Shift or f.lux).

# 2. Inconsistent Sleep Schedule

* **Why it’s bad:** Going to bed and waking up at different times confuses your **circadian rhythm**, making it harder to fall asleep and wake up consistently.
* **Fix:** Stick to a **set bedtime and wake-up time**, even on weekends.

# 3. Stimulants Too Late in the Day (Caffeine, Nicotine, etc.)

* **Why it’s bad:** Caffeine has a **half-life of 5-6 hours**, meaning that coffee or energy drinks in the afternoon can still be in your system at bedtime.
* **Fix:** Avoid caffeine **at least 6-8 hours before bed** (some people need even longer).

Grass eaters ignorance.

Many persons who have been killed, and slaughtered by pushing them from heights, causing car crashes, claims of misadventure when they are being chased, suicide, plain outright murder and only for the defectives to make up stories to close matters, this reveal will continue regardless to life risks. 

Family of authorities who removed the backpacker from the nightclub, a phone call that is attempted to be deleted on a 10yr cycle delete  to remove all evidence of involvement and a hostel involved in tax evasion with work for free staff/now calling themselves volunteers, a planned perversion in the course of justice by the delay in reporting the missing backpacker on purpose all to allow all security footage to be deleted on the 7 day loop.

The lies told in the coroners court about the phone location remaining at the beach when it did not. 

Remember there is only 2 pieces of evidence, where the phone location was switched off and where the phone pinged by a phone tower yet counsel for the coroner claims on advice from the poluce that phone towers can be out by 2000mtrs. ??? is that why pizza delivery says when the pizza is late?

The culprit being an ex ward of the state involved in Saffron's blackmail of members of the judiciary.

A 90yr supression order is made to protect the integrity of that judiciary who were involved in the paedophile ring and use of minors at the brothels during the salacious 80's.

The amount of full moon deaths prior to and following that are all mysterious deaths including Erwan Ferrieux,  Hugo Palmer, Ben Unwin, Taiki Kano, Jackson Stacker, Dieter Brummer, Mihai Salajanu, Gage Wilson, Anthony Stott,     Miles Bolton, Vincent Sweeney, James Doherty, Sophie Lee Fulagar, Benjamin Watego, Mark Dodds,    Patrick Leidke,  Sergio Cuesta, Jeffery Norris, Jhon Oritx Gamba, the list goes on. 

EVERY ONE at the full moon, many drug related. ALL Satanic assassinations at the full moon. 

Other mysterious deaths of DJ's all again related back to this dealer involved.

A satanic cult identified in WA in March 1991 involving a paedophile ring and Satanic practices still to this day being carried out and of the NSW State Defectives continue to cover up the so called gay satanic cult murdering people for self satisfaction. 

The called abandoned house at 'Nimbin' STATED by the PI employed by Hom cide NSW during the 60 Mn Unda investigation (program to deceive?), when the house was located at Repentance creek near Minyon falls, where ex actor then lawyer was pushed from the top of because he was now a threat to the culprits involved in the assault of the Belgian Backpacker as he was an eyewitness.

Many eyewitnesses have been silenced if they speak up, many threats continue to those who witnessed the chase and the assault resulting in the backpacker being thrown from the cliffs to the rocks below where the culprit knew where and visited there with 'The Judge' Shown in the images.

  
Statements now available of those who witnessed the chase along the beach.

How do authorities continue to deny this evidence, how can the people of Australia accept this deception?

Why do the authorities continue to deny it all happened and have the matter slumped on the ever increasing file data base to never open again?

Why do those individuals who become involved in drug supply and who go missing never have any interest by those authorities who continue to use them then get rid of them by dumping the files in the too hard hard drive??

Many persons involved with the supply and who are direct threats to the so called Last King of the Cross and family are systematically removed all with the help of those defectives to cover it up just like what was found in findings of the Wood Royal Commission.

The first Cross King, Ab Saffron assisted in the blackmail of authorities' figures including media owners, high society members of Sydney, High Court Justices, Barristers, Teachers, Politicians, ETC ETC. Yet we are led to believe that all that was fixed with the outcome of that Royal Commission.

It was clearly not fixed and still to this day continues with this cover up that is exposed here. 

Please copy and spread the word. It may be your family member next that is covered up, that is denied justice that we all pay for. Not to allow the coverup to continue any longer, Please help reveal the matters so there can be another Royal Commission to reveal even staff members of politicians offices in this whole mess that continues to unfold. 

Oh, and for the doubters out there, the exact location of the blood on the rocks has been located and photographed for future uses, the barnacles and exact location has been identified below the southern side of Cosy Cliffs and the location is easily accessible at low tide ONLY.

INQUIRIES SINCE THE FIRST INTERIM REPORT 1.8 Since 1 January 1996, further investigations have been conducted and evidence received in relation to each of the terms of reference. These further proceedings have been concerned with: · completing the examination of the specific corruption inquiries mentioned in the First Interim Report;

 · examining fresh areas involving possible serious misconduct, criminality and corruption, affecting other areas of the Service, principally within the Sydney metropolitan district;

 · further examining the performance of the Professional Responsibility Command in relation to certain internal inquiries;

 · examining the efficacy of the Internal Informers Program; · examining matters relating to the structure, management and procedures of the Service that might have contributed to the development of systemic or entrenched corruption, or hindered efforts to combat such corruption; 

· reviewing certain investigations or prosecutions of persons suspected of the unlawful sexual abuse of children; the existence or otherwise of networks of sexual abusers of that kind, the possible protection of such offenders, and neglect or breach of official duty in relation thereto; and 

· reviewing and assessing the adequacy of inter-agency relationships, practices and procedures concerning the protection of children from unlawful sexual abuse, and allied issues relating to the management and rehabilitation of both offenders and victims, within this area of criminality. 

1.9 Pursuant to Letters Patent issued on 21 February 1996, the Hon Judge Paul Urquhart QC was appointed Royal Commissioner14 to inquire into, and report to Justice Wood, on such aspects of the above mentioned terms of reference, as Commissioner Wood referred to him.

15 The evidence and exhibits tendered before him, and the reports prepared in relation to those inquiries, have been taken into account for the purposes of this Final Report.

 On 11 July 1996, Commissioner Urquhart was appointed Commissioner of the Police Integrity Commission, but he has continued to hold office as an additional Royal Commissioner, conducting inquiries upon referral.

TYPES OF POLICE CORRUPTION 

Police are more subject to corruption because they operate in an environment that offers both temptation and opportunity. In order to function efficiently, police are granted vast discretionary power which is necessary to react immediately to situations and make quick decisions (Kappeler, Slunder, & Alpert, 1994; Mastrofski, 2004). 

In particular, police jobs that involve a high degree of discretion are more likely to be exposed to corruption (e.g. they have the ability to enforce or ignore the law)(Heidenheimer & Johnston, 2002; Lauchs, Keast, & Yousefpour, 2011). 

Also, opportunities to enact deviance vary depending on the organizational structure, with some officers having more power than others (Barker & Carter, 1991, p. 49). By their nature, most police duties have many opportunities to accept bribes to make particular decisions, which assist crimes or criminals. According to the literature, police corruption falls into two main categories: grass-eating such as accepting free, inexpensive privileges such as accepting free coffee or free meals; or meat-eating which covers all forms of graft recognised by mainstream society, including bribes from criminals (Armstrong, 2012; Knapp, 1972; Punch, 2009, p.29). 

These categories can range from occupational deviance, when rules are bent to an employee‟s advantage and at the expense of the organization, such as theft at the workplace, to crimes committed by police officers(Punch, 2009). 

Noble cause corruption, also known as process corruption; refers to the manipulation of the justice system, usually to ensure a conviction(Australian Government, 2002; Caless, 2008). Such a process however, subverts the justice system by removing the opportunity for a fair trial and relying on proof beyond a reasonable doubt as the basis of guilt. There is a history of this type of corruption, referred colloquially as verballing, which is a frequently applied mechanism and is common across Australia. Lucas (1977) explains: “some, we are sure, would not “verbal”, in any circumstances; some would, but only as the result of considerable provocation and with an absolute conviction that the person is guilty; but some do “verbal” persistently and without conscience (Lucas, 1977, p. 15). 

The use of verballing can be the result of moral distance between the officer and the suspect. Moral distance has two components: the punishment justification that is showing the person is guilty of a punishable/vengeful act, and the legal affirmation that is affirming the legitimacy of your own cause in acting against them(Grossman, 1995, p. 165-167). 

This position psychologically allows an officer to justify unethical acts such as stitching up or verballing on the basis that the accused is guilty and deserves to be punished (Chan, Devery, & Doran, 2003). Police can have a tendency to see themselves as the „white hats‟ or good guys as opposed to the „black hats‟ in the community. 

While this is literally true, there is a danger that entire groups, rather than offending individuals, are depicted as “malicious, alien forces intruding on the world of well-meaning, unsuspecting, virtuous people” (Baumeister, 1997, p.89). P

Lets see who goes on stress leave to avoid the next inquest or court case to attempt to deny justice.      ATM, the investigation dude is with the security dude at another place nearby.

Bring on the law suits, bring on the reason to get the subpoena that is promised because of the identifying of you all involved.

The application Grindr is going nowhere, the data stored is available and protected and the legal team is waiting. Meta Data is protected, as is the data matching.

As are barristers and a whole support network to reveal all this BS placed on the state of NSW and the people of Australia and the whole world in fact. 

Misinformation? The police invented it. Remember Australia's first police force was made up of convicts.

Out with La bor and Lib liars.

I usually eat OMAD and would like to continue that except for bone broth which I plan on having dispersed throughout the day.

Day 1
Bone broth throughout the day and one orange, drinking only water and coffee

Day2
Continue broth but add a salad with vinaigrette to it (small portion of fish or chicken with it)

Day 3
Fish and shrimp, I was hoping to fry in oil. Vegetables and bone broth as well, perhaps in a soup with some seasoning.

Day 4
My original plan was to end refeeding at this point and treat my diet normally. My only concern is that I’d like to get a slice of cake and maybe a restaurant meal (perhaps fast food, not sure) since I started the fast on my birthday.

Thanks for all the suggestions I could find for my trip that we just did. 

I just have some questions regarding hotels overall. We did stay in the Hilton Resort World and the Venetian  I am mostly used to European hotels so I am not sure what's special to Las Vegas and what might just be usual in the states:

- is it normal not to have coffee-/tea making facilities?
- receptionists seemed to do their job just fine. However anything above the bare minimum they did not do. For example we asked to switch to a different room (Twin instead of King) as it got mixed up by the person booking for us. The guy said ""the system doesn't let me do it because of the rate you booked"". I know the system and I know it can be tricky but it seemed like he just didn't want to
- Cleanliness was sub-par. Remotes that were not cleaned in a long time. Visible clump of hair in the shower. Thick layer of dust/grime on bathroom light (eye-level)
- very few amenities in the room. Not even some basic stationary. Also missing some kind of welcome that I'd usually expect with those kinds of hotels

When Taylor asked me out to dinner, I knew what was going to happen. Same thing that always happened when I went on a date. I really liked her, though. I thought maybe that could make a difference. 

Maybe, if I tried hard enough, I could just ignore it - just ignore *her*. 

I was wrong. 

\-------

Seated across from my date in the candlelit restaurant, I felt my phantom itch begin to flare up, setting the small of my back on fire. Taylor had been recounting her time in the police academy, but I couldn't follow what she was saying. The discomfort broke my concentration. As the itch's burning pleads intensified, my eyes darted around the dining room, horrified by what was appearing around me.

As expected, I had begun seeing the face everywhere.

It was in the pattern of our server’s tie, as well as on the red tablecloth beside me, formed from a very particular set of creases. It was on Taylor’s plate, as the arrangement of her half-eaten veal parmesan had created the image of a single bulging eye above a hooked nose.

Forcefully, I scratched the small of my back while keeping my eyes locked on Taylor, trying to keep this date afloat. Judging by her newly furrowed brow, I appeared to be doing a terrible job at hiding my distress, however. My clipped fingernails dragged against the burning patch of skin through my undershirt, but it was no use. No matter what I did, the sensation refused to yield.

The itch always gets worse when the face is around, and the face always comes around when I’m on a date.

Frustrated, I gave up on relieving the itch and brought my hand back to the table, accidentally knocking over my glass of Pinot Noir with the side of my wrist. It splashed onto my white napkin, staining it with the start of a familiar pattern. Taylor sprung to action, grabbing her napkin to help clean up the mess, but I intercepted her hand.

*“Wait…wait a second,”* I mumbled, eyes glued to the developing spill.

As the liquid lost momentum, I saw it; a crisply detailed face, framed by the white material like an impromptu watercolor painting or a purple-red Rorschach Test.

It was the same face that had haunted me since I was nineteen. The same snaggle-toothed smirk with the same bulging right eye, accompanied by the same sharply hooked nose connecting those two features.

*There she is,* I thought to myself.

Nervous sweat dripped down my face like condensation falling off a cold glass of lemonade on a sweltering day. I felt my lips quiver as I spoke, forming shaky words.

*“Taylor…I understand how this sounds, but…do you see anything on the napkin? Like…anything recognizable?”* I asked without looking up, gaze still fixed on the horrible stain.

*“Uhm…well, turn it towards me.”*

When I finally looked at her, she was squinting at the napkin, studying the crimson design. For a moment, I was gripped by a profound twinge of embarrassment, anxious thoughts popping into my head like rapidly growing weeds.

*Taylor’s a gorgeous, intelligent, remarkably kind woman. And I’m completely blowing my chance to make us into something. Don’t scare her off.*

A subtle change in her expression pulled me out of my self-loathing; a small tilt of her head complemented by a flicker of her eyes. It might have been recognition. She might have truly seen the face.

But I didn’t remain at that table long enough to ask.

As I blinked, Taylor’s face instantly disappeared, seamlessly replaced by the horrific visage I was asking if she could see in the stain. My body trembled with that one protruding eye glaring at me, bloodshot capillaries writhing like thin snakes under the white membrane. Before I could even think, a familiar phrase slipped out of the corner of her mouth, snaggletooth wiggling as those two familiar words became airborne.

*“You’re mine.”*

I let loose a scream, falling from my chair and onto the ground. Taylor jumped out from the table, rushing over to me with a look of concern painted on her *actual* face, but I was inconsolable. Wild with fear, I turned from her and started to run, briefly traversing the carpet on all fours like a rabid animal. By the time I was sprinting out of the restaurant, I had gotten to my feet, panting ragged breaths as I slid into the front seat of my car and sped off.

\-------

That was three months ago. She ended up paying for both of our meals. Not only that, but she had to Uber home since I had driven her there.

Needless to say, Taylor didn’t reach out to arrange a second date. 

There was one tiny silver lining, thankfully. Although we both work for the police department, our positions infrequently overlapped. I work in forensics, and she’s a uniformed officer. The times we did see each other, both assigned to the same crime scene, Taylor would give me a weak smile with a polite wave, and I would somberly reciprocate the gesture back at her.

Just another potential relationship ruined by my pareidolia.

\--------

Pareidolia: ***noun,*** \[pair-ahy-**doh**\-lee-*uh*\]

1) a situation in which someone sees a pattern or image of something that does not exist, for example, a face in a cloud.

\--------

I first saw that face about a decade ago, back when an actual person possessed it.

When I was nineteen, my family moved to a small town near my college. I didn’t love the arrangement. I mean, what freshman wants to be living with their parents? But I wasn’t paying my way through undergraduate, so I had little room to complain.

Ms. Besthet lived in the house across from us. From what I understand, she had been perfectly normal before we moved in. A pillar of the community, even.

She was in her late forties and worked as a professor of literary studies at my college. She went to church every Sunday, and she donated a quarter of her salary to the local children’s hospital. Ms. Besthet was childless and unmarried, but that was the only societal deficiency in her otherwise perfect record.

I never met *that* woman, though. I met someone else about a week after we moved in.

While unpacking my bedroom upstairs, I heard my mom calling me. She hollered for me to come down - one of our new neighbors had stopped by to introduce herself.

Jogging down the stairs, I followed the scent of freshly brewed coffee into the kitchen. Ms. Besthet was sitting at our table, her back to me as I approached.

*“Oh! And here he is now. This is my son, Grant,”* my mother remarked, lifting her mug and pointing it in my direction.

The middle-aged woman shifted in her chair, turning to meet me. At first, her expression was unremarkable; warm and friendly, nothing more. But when our eyes met, something changed. Ms. Besthet’s face twisted into a picture of ecstatic bliss. Her cheeks became rosy and flushed. Her eyes beamed, gleaming with undiluted euphoria. I think I even saw a tear trickle down the side of her nose before the effects of the stroke started to appear.

Love at first sight and its collateral damage, I guess.

As her brain swelled and suffocated, completely deprived of oxygen, Ms. Besthet’s face contorted from elation into the ghastly expression that has tormented me for the last ten years.

Without a word, she collapsed to the floor. My mother screamed for me to stay with Ms. Besthet as she hurried out of the kitchen, running to call 9-1-1 from her cell phone that had been charging in the living room.

Paralyzed from the abject horror of it all, I found myself unable to leave Ms. Besthet’s side, even though I certainly wanted to. Instead, I just stared at her, wondering if this odd woman was really about to die in front of me. Two words escaped from her lips before she lost consciousness, whispered from her crumpled position on the ground, her single open eye fixed squarely on me.

*“You’re mine.”*

\--------

Ms. Besthet didn’t die that day, but when she returned home from the hospital a month later, she was a different person, apparently.

To this day, I can’t figure out whether the stroke caused her newfound obsession, some bizarre manifestation of her brain damage, or whether her newfound obsession caused the stroke, desire short-circuiting her nervous system like an old car battery. I suppose the order doesn’t actually matter. Whatever happened that day, the end result was the same.

The woman had become downright infatuated with me.

Every afternoon, I’d see her at her front window, curtains wide open, waiting for me to return from class, anchoring her gaze to me the second I stepped out of my car. The stroke had damaged her nerves, leaving the left half of her face paralyzed. Meaning that, when she stared at me, it’d only be through her right eye, bulging from how intensely she was watching.

Months later, once her strength had more or less returned, Ms. Besthet resumed teaching at my college. Tried to resume teaching, at least. Sometimes she’d actually show up to her classes, sometimes she wouldn’t. As it would happen, the sessions she missed were during the times that I was also on campus. Instead of attending her own lectures, I’d catch her peering at me from around hallway corners or through the cracks of slightly opened doors, always scampering away once I caught on to her enamored surveillance.

The college didn’t fire her. Instead, without warning, she voluntarily resigned. The day after she quit, Ms. Besthet went missing. Disappeared without a trace. Didn’t pack a bag, didn’t take her car. She just vanished.

Many of my neighbors were worried sick, while I was secretly relieved. I didn’t care where she had gone, and I wasn’t preoccupied with the possibility that something bad had happened to her.

Wherever she was, Ms. Besthet was finally leaving me alone. 

Or she was being less obvious about it, at least.

A few quiet weeks passed before I heard a loud *thump* on our living room window, home alone while my parents were out of town. I had fallen asleep on the couch watching a movie, but the strange noise yanked me awake. My eyes, still hazy from sleep, looked over to a nearby digital clock, which showed the time was two in the morning. As my vision became clearer, I noticed something that made the hairs on the nape of my neck stand on end.

I saw the faint silhouette of a person, leaning against the living room window from the outside. Not only that, but they had pressed their body so hard against the glass that the sound of it had woken me up.

Terror vibrating in the back of my throat, I crept over to the window. The bright flickering images from our wide-screen TV cast inky shadows that danced over me as I moved through the room. When I finally stood in front of the silhouette, inches away from the glass, my entire body buzzed with fear and anticipation.

I twisted the blinds open.

But, to my surprise, there was no one there. All I saw through that window was an empty cul-de-sac, dimly lit by phosphorescent streetlights.

An involuntary sigh of relief billowed from my lungs, and I let the tension in shoulders fall like an avalanche of muscle and ligament down below my collarbone.

The relief didn’t last.

When I was about to turn away, I noticed a smudge on the glass. It wasn’t easy to see in the low light, but once I saw it, I couldn’t look away. I tried to suppress my recognition of the shape, but it was too perfectly identical to be anything other than an imprint of Ms. Besthet’s face.

Two months later, some kids stumbled upon a decomposing body in the woods behind my house.

According to the police, it looked like Ms. Besthet had been living there since her disappearance. The authorities eventually ruled her death a tragic accident; starvation in the setting of psychosis.

I wouldn’t learn this until years later, but the only thing she had on her person when she expired was a polaroid camera. A detective that worked the case let that fact slip in passing, gushing about how strange it all was, unaware that I lived less than a hundred yards from where the woman had simply laid down and died.

When I asked him if she had any photos with her, he refused to tell me more.

*""I've said too much already, sorry.""*

\--------

From a dating perspective, my twenties have been hellish. Echoes of Ms. Besthet’s face have stalked me since the day she died. Under normal circumstances, it’s an infrequent disturbance. Once a month, maybe. But if I ever find myself flirting, though, imprints of her face will start proliferating in my surroundings, swirling around me like a swarm of wasps.

And if I’m ever stupid enough to actually go on a date? Multiply all of that by twenty.

Not to mention the goddamned itch. In the end, that’s what really stopped me from pursuing romance. I think I could ignore the faces; however numerous they’d become. It’d be difficult, but I could do it. The itch is a different story. At peak intensity, it’s like my skin is burning from an invisible fire that won’t go out. The discomfort can completely overwhelm me to the point where I would do anything to make it stop.

So, I’ve resigned myself to isolation. Dating just hasn’t been worth the pain. It’s been lonely, sure, but abstaining has kept me safe and relatively sane. Meeting Taylor, however, changed things. Taylor rekindled something inside me that I believed was completely extinguished before I met her. She made me want to fight back.

That was delusional.

A misjudgment I won’t be making again.

\--------

Over the last two weeks, I’ve been daydreaming about Taylor. We’ve had some casual conversations since that disaster of a first date, and I realized that I’ve given her nothing in the way of an explanation for my behavior that night.

Yesterday, though, I made a resolution.

I would ask Taylor to meet me for coffee the day *after* Valentine’s Day. Asking her to coffee *on* Valentine’s Day would be a little strange, I thought. I didn’t plan on explaining everything to her, but I could at least apologize for leaving her high and dry. Maybe pay her back for dinner and the Uber. If she seemed receptive to all that, and if I found a bit of courage, maybe I’d ask her if she was willing to give us another try.

Satisfied with the plan, I continued through my workday.

A few hours later, I was called in to assist with a case - a dead body discovered in the middle of a nearby park that had everyone scratching their heads.

When I arrived on scene, I understood their confusion.

The corpse was propped up against a tree, its details initially obscured by the tree’s shadow. Honestly, it was hard to even tell it was a human body from where I parked, which was only twenty feet away. At that distance, the thing looked more like a burlap sack filled with ground beef than it did a human cadaver.

When I approached, however, I started to appreciate its humanity. A fractured bone jutting out here, a few fingers poking out there. Somehow, the corpse had been twisted into an incomprehensible sphere of mangled flesh and bone. It was like God had taken this poor soul, placed them between the palms of their comet-sized hands, and rolled them until they were molded into a ball like human pizza dough.

But that wasn’t even the strangest part: the corpse lacked decay, meaning that whoever they were, they were freshly dead. Our lead detective had initially assumed that we were standing on the crime scene, given how recently we had presumed they died. At the same time, the scene was *completely* bloodless, which argued against that theory. Not a speck of it on them, not a speck of it around the tree.

No blood that we could see, at least. Despite what we all see in the movies, blood sprays aren’t always obvious.

I opened my forensics toolbag and pulled a spray bottle of luminol from it. If there was even a drop to be found, the chemical would react with it, oxidizing the molecular iron present in blood, resulting in a faint blue glow. Thankfully, the large tree’s shadow completely covered the victim. To properly see the glow, I needed the area to be dark.

As the liquid contacted the corpse, parts of it did glow. 

Moments later, the lead detective put a gentle hand on my shoulder and said something that nearly caused me to pass out. I hadn’t heard him approach, transfixed by the shape that had appeared after I sprayed the luminol.

*“We found the victim’s wallet in the nearby brush. I think…I think you knew her.”*

I didn’t need him to continue, but I didn’t stop him, either. When I saw the imprint of Ms. Besthet’s face glowing on the corpse like a cosmic stamp of approval, I already knew what he was about to tell me.

*“It’s…it’s Taylor.”*

My memory of the next few minutes is a bit jumbled. I have a very fuzzy recollection of driving home. It consists mostly of my own feral screams filling the car with unearthly noise, rather than a memory of the drive itself.

Everything becomes clear again when I walked through the door of my apartment. As soon as my foot passed that threshold, I felt the phantom itch abruptly manifest on the small of my back, worse than it’s ever been before. Struggling to move, I stumbled through my apartment, scratching wildly at the area as I did, clawing at the skin with reckless abandon. Eventually, I made my way into the bathroom.

As I unbuttoned my shirt, an entirely new pain came into being. It wasn’t the pins and needles of an unmanaged itch; the discomfort was too sharp. It caused me to double over in agony, leaning my elbow against the rim of the sink to keep myself upright. I wasn't even scratching anymore, and yet the pain was still escalating, as if I was manually peeling thick strips of meat from around my spine with my hands. I felt the tearing sensation making a line across my skin, inch by tortuous inch.

In a frenzy, I ripped my shirt off and turned my back towards the mirror, desperate to identify the source of the new pain. What I witnessed in that moment broke me completely.

A laceration was forming, completely on its own, unzipping layers of skin before my eyes, the tissue audibly splitting and popping in my ears.

Above the impossible wound, there was a single brown mole about the size of a nickel. There was also an old scar from a biking injury, below the mole but above the laceration; a fibrinous line running between the two landmarks, connecting them to each other.

An eye, a hooked nose, and a bloody smirk.

As I noticed it, the lacerating paused, and the room became quiet.

I watched helplessly as the lips of the gash began moving, causing jolts of debilitating pain to radiate through my back, silently mouthing those two horrible words.

*“You’re mine.”*

I took my tour with Garden Villa in Ha Giang and these are my highlights.



VIP Sleeper Bus – 6 hours overnight. First time experience riding one of these. It was quite comfy and it wasn't too hard falling asleep. We were let out mid way through the journey for a washroom break and quick snack.



Garden Villa – A quaint homestay on the edge of Ha Giang town. Friendly hosts with a big motorcycle collection for rent to ride on the Ha Giang Loop. We were served a nice family style breakfast alongside tea and coffee. The rooms are small yet cozy. It’s also located by a river so you can get some awesome views. 



Ha Giang City – Nice small yet bustling town. If I can get the chance, I’d want to explore it more. We had to drive 15 minutes from one end to the other to reach the start of the Ha Giang Loop.



EZ Drivers – Best way to ride the Ha Giang Loop if you don’t have your driver's permit. You’ll be on the back of a professional driver, who knows the loop by heart.



Police checkpoints – Was told by my driver that a ticket costs about 2,000,000 VND or $80 USD a day. Some travelers will eat the fee just for the thrill of driving a motorbike. 



Bac Sum Pass – Twisty and windy roads, through mountain passes. The roads are beautiful here with great scenery all around.



Quan Ba Heaven’s Gate – Panoramic mountain views with endless rice fields and rolling hills in the distance. This was where I began to understand the appeal of the Ha Giang Loop. There’s a coffee shop at the summit where you can enjoy some Ha Giang mayflower coffee. It was so delicious!



Twin Mountains / Fair Bosom Mountains – On further inspection, it does look like a set of bosoms. Perfectly symmetrical. Nature is beautiful. The EZ riders brought us to a rest stop with a perfect view of the Twin mountains.



Roadside stalls – You’ll see many along the loop, selling grilled meats, fruits and drinks. They’re nice places to stretch, relax and fuel up.



Ethnic tribes people – Along the way I saw many ethnic tribes people going about their days. Whether it’s running the roadside stalls or walking along the roadside with their days work on their backs. You’ll recognize them right away by their distinctive garbs.



Lang Khuy Cave – A small detour from the main road. You’ll have to do a short trek before reaching the cave. Expect to see stalactite formations, unique rock structures and ponds within. It was nice to stretch my legs after a day of riding the back of a motorbike.



Pine forests – A pretty cool sight to see in tropical Vietnam. The forests keep you cool during the ride.



Yen Minh – Small quaint town with a population of primarily of ethnic tribes. There’s a morning market here where you can see various tribes converge to trade and sell their specialty wares. Each tribe will have their distinctive clothing.



Thang Co – Horse stew, a local Hmong specialty. It has a strong gamey taste that is offset by the many spices that flavor the dish. Not something I’d yearn for again but it was certainly worth a try. We got to enjoy it with rounds of “happy water” or rice wine, which helped wash down the flavor.

For love that still remains ,



A Season of  Us: 

     The willow tree swayed gently in the summer wind, its long, slender branches dancing in the air. Sunlight filtered through the cascading leaves, painting shifting patterns on the grass, golden and fleeting. The air smelled of warm earth and my sweat, and it was such a beautiful day. I felt the wind pass through the leaves, brushing softly against my skin—gently and with care—as my eyes found you for the first time. 

The world was moving, but in that moment, everything stood still. I barely had time to breathe before you stepped closer, your presence as light as the wind threading through the willow’s branches. You were wearing white, almost glowing in the sunlight. Your soft brown hair framed your face, and your eyes—warm, deep, and full of something I couldn’t yet name—met mine with quiet understanding. 

""Hey,"" you said, your voice soft, careful, as if you already knew exactly what I needed to hear. 

I turned toward you, the warmth of the sun paling in comparison to the quiet heat that spread in my chest. You radiated warmth—not just in the way you spoke, but in the way you smiled, a smile I could only see in your eyes. You were someone who, in a single word, made the world feel smaller and bigger all at once. 

We talked the rest of that evening, lost in the kind of effortless conversation that felt like it had been waiting to happen all along. We laughed, we joked, and something blossomed that day—something delicate, something new. When the sun began to sink, casting the sky in gold, I tucked a flower into your hair. And when you went home that night, you carried it with you, a quiet reminder of me. 

For weeks, it was just us beneath the summer sky. The days bled together in a haze of warm winds and quiet laughter. We talked about everything and nothing, filling the air between us with words that felt weightless and important all at once. The way you smiled, the way the sunlight caught in your hair—it never got old. It was simple, effortless, the kind of happiness that feels like it will last forever, even when you know it won’t. 

One afternoon, you sat beside me, closer than usual. The sun hung low in the sky, casting golden light through the branches. Without hesitation, without a second thought, you eased yourself onto my lap, settling there like you belonged, like this was the most natural thing in the world. 

The days stretched on, but even summer had its limits. The warmth in the air felt endless, but I knew it wasn’t. 

The last day before break snuck up on us, quiet and unannounced, like the final note of a song you don’t want to end. We lingered, sitting in the grass longer than usual, neither of us willing to acknowledge what came next. The wind was softer that evening, the light fading into something more fragile. 

And then, without a word, you stepped forward and wrapped your arms around me. It wasn’t a fleeting embrace, not a simple goodbye. It was something deeper—unspoken, but understood. You held onto me like you didn’t want to let go, like the day might last a little longer if we just stood there, together. 

I let my arms tighten around you, breathing in the faint trace of your perfume. I wanted to say something, something meaningful, something that would keep this moment from slipping away. But all I could do was hold you, hoping you felt everything I couldn’t put into words. 

When you pulled away, you smiled, though your eyes carried something else—something softer, sadder. 

""I’ll talk to you soon,"" you said, like a promise. 

I nodded, but as I watched you walk away, the wind stirring the leaves behind you, I couldn’t help but wonder if things would ever feel quite the same again.


Summer stretched out before me in highways and hotel rooms. The trip should have felt exciting—new places, new sights—but everywhere I went, there was an ache beneath it all. I saw things I wanted to tell you about. A sunset over the desert that painted the sky in soft pinks and oranges, so breathtaking it felt unreal. A quiet café in a small town, where the scent of coffee and old books reminded me of the way you’d tuck a loose strand of hair behind your ear while you read. The wind blowing through tall pine trees, wild and endless—I wondered if you’d love them as much as I did. 

Every time I saw something beautiful, my first thought was you. I wanted to send you pictures, to tell you what I was seeing, to hear your voice, to feel even a little closer. But distance has a way of making things feel fragile, like a connection stretched too thin. At night, I would lie awake thinking about us, about the way you fit so perfectly in my arms that last day. The road kept moving forward, but my heart stayed behind, somewhere beneath the skys we would lay together under.




Someone Worth My Every Word:


     I don’t remember exactly where I was when I found out—only how it felt. The world didn’t stop. The sun still hung in the sky, the warm air still wrapped around me, but everything inside me went cold. It was a quiet kind of devastation, the kind that doesn’t come with screaming or breaking things. Just silence. 

She wasn’t mine alone. 

I was the one who held her. The one who felt her warmth, who traced circles on the back of her hand, who pulled her close into my arms as wind whispered through the leaves. I was the one who kissed her, who made her laugh, who saw the way her eyes softened in the golden light. 

But I wasn’t the only one who had her heart. 

Somewhere, miles away, there was another man. A name I had never known, a presence I had never felt, and yet, he had been there all along. He wasn’t here to hold her, but he didn’t have to be. He had her words, her late-night thoughts, the part of her that I couldn’t reach. While I had been the one by her side, he had been the one in her heart. 

The realization came in pieces—offhand comments, messages that didn’t make sense until they did. I reread the words again and again, as if looking for some way to misinterpret them, some mistake that would make this anything but what it was. But there was no mistake. 

Every moment we had shared—the laughter, the touches, the whispered promises beneath the evening sky—had belonged to someone else, too. I wanted to be angry. I should have been angry. But all I felt was hollow, like something had been quietly stolen from me before I even knew to hold it tighter, And yet, despite it all, I couldn’t let go. 

Summer ended, but the weight of what I knew didn’t. When I saw her again, it was like nothing had changed. She smiled the same way, spoke with the same softness, held me like I was still hers and hers alone. But I wasn’t. Not really. We fell back into each other, as if the time apart had only made the pull between us stronger. And for a while, I let myself believe it. 

Let myself forget the quiet truth that lingered beneath every touch, every kiss. But it was always there, just beneath the surface. The night it all caught up to me, she was in my arms, her warmth pressed against me, her breath soft against my skin. It should have been perfect. It should have been just us.


But I wasn’t alone in that moment. 

Somewhere in the back of my mind, he was there. A shadow lingering in the space between us, unspoken but undeniable. I wondered if she thought of him, too. If she ever looked at me and saw something missing. 

I wanted to hold her closer, to pull her so deep into me that there would be no space left for anyone else. But love doesn’t work like that. No matter how tightly you hold on, you can’t erase the parts of someone you weren’t there for. 

That night, when she left, I sat in the silence and stared at my hands, at the empty space where she had just been. 

And then I wrote. 

I wrote to her, letter after letter, words spilling onto the page like they could somehow fix what was breaking. I told her why it had to be me, why we belonged together, why none of this could be real if it wasn’t meant to last. I told her how much it hurt, how much I loved her, how I couldn’t picture a future where she wasn’t mine alone. 

And I waited. 

Days blurred together, passing in slow, aching silence. Every unread message, every moment without a reply, felt like another piece of me unraveling. I told myself she needed time. That she was thinking, deciding, realizing what we had was real—was worth choosing.
And then, one night, she answered.
Not just with words, but with something deeper. Something undeniable.
She chose me. 

I don’t know if it was my letters, the weight of our memories, or something she had known all along but had been too afraid to face. But when she looked at me, really looked at me, I knew. It was in the way she held my hand, in the way she whispered my name, in the way she made the world feel whole again.
The uncertainty, the pain, the long nights spent wondering—they all melted away in the warmth of her touch. And for a while, it felt like that choice was enough.
Like love, once fought for, could finally be ours without question. 

Loving her felt like holding onto something delicate, something that wasn’t mine to keep. She was there—in my arms, in my laughter, in the quiet moments where our hands found each other in the dark—but not mine. Not in the way I wanted, not in the way that made this love feel safe. 

It was a strange kind of agony, to have almost everything and still feel the hollow ache of what was missing. I would catch glimpses of something real, something certain, in the way she looked at me when she thought I wasn’t watching. In the way her fingers lingered a little too long against mine. In the way she whispered my name, like it meant something more. But then there were the moments that made me wonder if I was just something comfortable. If I was the warmth she needed, but not the love she wanted. If I was still just a choice she hadn’t fully made. 

Because when I held her, I could feel it—the weight of something unspoken. And when she pulled away, I couldn’t help but wonder if she was always meant to leave. 

Some days, it felt like we were closer than ever. Other days, she felt like a stranger—one I had memorized but could never truly hold. I smiled when I was with her, laughed at her jokes, held her the way I had always dreamed of. But inside, I was unraveling. The uncertainty clung to me like a shadow, creeping into every quiet moment, every unspoken thought. It was exhausting, pretending not to care that I wasn’t hers completely. Pretending that I didn’t notice the hesitation in her voice when I asked where we stood. 

I was almost hers. Almost enough.
But almost wasn’t the same as being chosen.
And then, finally, she told me. 

""I'm not sure my parents will like you"" 

It should have felt like an answer, like something solid to hold onto. But instead, it felt like another condition, another checkpoint I had to pass just to prove what I already knew—I loved her. I had always loved her. 

But love wasn’t enough.
I nodded, smiled, told her I understood. But deep down, a quiet voice whispered a question I wasn’t ready to face:
Would meeting them really change anything?
Or was I just waiting for a door that was never meant to open?






The Night You Became Mine:




    Christmas break came, and with it, the quiet hush of winter. The world felt different, softer somehow, wrapped in the glow of string lights and the promise of something new. Each night, we talked—long conversations stretching into the early hours, whispered words about us, about what we could be, about the future that felt so close, yet still out of reach. 

For the first time, it felt real. Not just a dream, not just a question lingering between us, but something tangible, something waiting just beyond the next step. The day break began, I drove her home, and for a brief moment, two of my worlds collided—she met my grandmother. It was a fleeting exchange, but it meant something. Like a bridge between the life I had always known and the life I wanted to build with her. 

On the walk back, she reached for my hand, fingers lacing between mine like they had always belonged there. It was such a simple thing, but in that moment, it was everything. And then, finally, she asked me. 

I want you to meet my parents. 

The words hit like a wave, a mix of relief and nerves, the final piece of the puzzle that had been waiting to fall into place. I had spent months teetering on the edge of something I couldn’t name, and now, she was handing me the answer. 

I wanted to be ready. I needed to be ready. 

The night of, I stood in front of the mirror for what felt like hours, adjusting, second-guessing, trying to make sure I looked right. Not just presentable—but like someone they could accept. Like someone worthy of being hers. 

When I met them, it was inside the walls of their faith, their traditions, their world. Church felt like a silent test, an unspoken judgment, and I could only hope I had the right answers. Her parents were reserved, their words coming through her as she translated. I fumbled through my broken Spanish, trying to bridge a gap that felt impossible to cross. 

But somehow, I did. 

By the end of the night, they liked me. Not just them—her family, her friends, her brothers, even the neighbors who watched from afar. It felt like acceptance, like approval. Like maybe, this was real.
And through it all, she and I exchanged glances, hands brushing against each other in the dim light. A silent conversation neither of us spoke aloud. 

At some point, we slipped out of the church doors, stepping into the crisp December air. The cold bit at our skin, but neither of us cared. The world outside was quiet, the only sound our breath mingling in the space between us. 

Then, in the darkness, away from watching eyes, she leaned in. 

And I kissed her. 

It was soft at first, hesitant, like we were both afraid of shattering the moment. But then, she melted into me, and suddenly, nothing else existed. Not the cold, not the nerves, not the months of waiting. Just us. 

By the time the night ended, we stood at my car, her eyes lingering on mine. For a moment, there was nothing but silence between us, the weight of the night settling around us like fog. And then, before I could stop myself, I pulled her close. 

She gasped softly, caught off guard, but didn’t pull away. Instead, she let me hold her, let me press my lips to hers again, filled with everything I had been holding in for so long. 

It felt like forever. And it felt perfect. 

When we finally pulled away, breathless, I searched her eyes for something—certainty, understanding, maybe even fear. But all I found was warmth.
The next night, I asked her the question I had been carrying in my heart since the beginning. 

Will you be mine? 

And she said yes.





The Ghost Of You: 

I would like to say things were perfect, that love was enough.
But love is a slow burn, an ember that lingers even after the fire has died. It does not vanish—it settles, deep and quiet, into the hollows of who we are. It waits in the spaces between memories, in the pauses between words never spoken. 

For months, you were a presence in my absence, a whisper in my silence. I woke to the scent of you still clinging to my clothes, to the shape of you pressed into the empty spaces of my life. I carried you in the weight of my hands, in the ache of every quiet moment. 

I told myself time would soften the edges, that one morning I would wake up and forget how it felt to love you. But love is not a wound that heals clean—it scars, it lingers. It makes a home in the spaces it was never meant to stay. 

So I mourned you like the dead, even as you walked past me in the halls. I mourned you in the way I traced old messages, in the way I clutched a stuffed animal that still smelled like you. I mourned you in the way I sat in silence, replaying every moment, every mistake, every version of us that could have been. 

And while I grieved, you lived.
You laughed with someone else, let another hold you the way I once did. Maybe it was meant to hurt me, or maybe it wasn’t. But it did.
And the worst part?
I let it. 

Because pain was the last piece of you I had left.
Then, after months of silence, you returned.
""My Mom's on her deathbed,"" you said. ""And I wanted you to know—you meant something to her. She wished she had known you more.""
And just like that, nothing else mattered. Not the time, not the distance, not the way you had become a stranger to me. I responded in an instant. 

That night, we spoke for hours, slipping back into the rhythm of something half-remembered. And for the first time since you left, you gave me the words I had once begged for.
""You were my everything. I loved you.""
It should have been enough. It should have put me back together.
But love shouldn’t be something you realize only when it’s gone. 

Two days later, before the sun had risen, you told me she was gone.
And I was there, the way I had always been. Holding space for your sorrow, catching the words that trembled on your lips. You sought me out in the hallways, walked beside me like nothing had changed. But something had.
That night, you told me you had a boyfriend. 

""He’s better than you,"" you said. ""He actually cares. He actually talks to me.""
And that was it. That was the moment my heart withered away.
I haven’t truly loved since.
A few days later, I finally noticed it—the willow tree was gone.
Cut down, just like us.
Maybe love is not a promise. Maybe love is just something that happens.
I still dream of you.
Once, I dreamt of a girl I did not recognize. She spent the day with me, her laughter like something I had once known. And when she turned to me, she whispered, ""I miss you.""
And I looked at her, confused, until I realized— 

It was you. 

But when I woke up, I could not remember your face. I could not remember your voice.
I only felt empty.
Perhaps this is how love leaves us. Not in a storm, not in a single, shattering moment, but in the quiet erasure of details. In the way a name becomes just a name. In the way a memory becomes just something that happened. 

You are almost a ghost now.

I had a hybrid position where I went into the office 4x a month. I drive 160 miles (2.5 hours) one way. Baby was born November of last year so he is 3 months old now. Hubby and I were going over the budget to make sure we weren’t too far in the red, and it really put into perspective how much we saved from me working from home. Things I’ll have to start purchasing again or more frequently are;

Makeup- my makeup has expired. I focused on having clear skin and it paid off. I will be purchasing again so I look more put together.

Gas- going into the office 4x a month cost me about $75, going in everyday will be $100 a week. Husband is within walking distance so we spent no more than $150 a month on gas. Also wear and tear. I’ll have to get my car maintenances a lot sooner.

Plastic Water bottles- we got a brita filter to save. We used to purchase 6 cases of water from Costco a month so $60 a month. We now buy one case a month and it’s mainly for our baby’s formula or to take on the go since my water jug is huge. I’ll have to start purchasing and bringing to work since the water filter at work is not maintained.

Office clothes- I will have to buy a new wardrobe since I won’t have enough time to lose weight to fit my old office clothes. I wasn’t bummy at home but very casual.

Frozen meals- frozen meals are more expensive than meal prepping yourself but since I have a 5 hour round trip will have to buy these as a back up in case I’m too tired to cook or meal prep in advance. 

Teacher cart- will need to purchase to lug all my stuff to work; laptop, laptop accessories, purse, breast pump, water bottle, coffee, and lunch

Nespresso- I did purchase this so I won’t have to stop at the gas station or Starbucks to get my daily caffeine. My Starbucks order comes up to about $13 each time. Venti brown sugar oatmilk espresso with vanilla cold foam and egg bites.

Childcare expenses- my in-laws are in their 60’s so offered to watch our baby for free everyday for 4 hours which fills the gap since hubby and I work opposite schedules. I would not have been watching baby while working as my job wont allow it. They don’t feel comfortable watching baby any longer than that so we will have to pay a nanny or baby sitter to fill my gap since my commute is long. 

Baby formula- I exclusively pump so while I’m gone my in laws and husband will have to rely on formula.

This is what we have identified so far. What are you guys new expenses?

Some of this would be residential but more than likely here in California there would be sufficient commercial work as well for places like coffee shops and bars. The Trades involved would most likely be a cabinet maker/carpenter for the planters, and a plumber for the watering systems. These would be the main 2 the majority of the time, but electrician work and metal work could also be part of it in some circumstances. My question is that it seems that B-2 residential remodeling requires 3 or more trades to be involved in any contract that you take, so would this prevent me from taking jobs that only involved 2 trades? is there a way around this or would it simply be easier to get a B general building license. any feedback is appreciated.

For love that still remains ,



A Season of  Us: 

     The willow tree swayed gently in the summer wind, its long, slender branches dancing in the air. Sunlight filtered through the cascading leaves, painting shifting patterns on the grass, golden and fleeting. The air smelled of warm earth and my sweat, and it was such a beautiful day. I felt the wind pass through the leaves, brushing softly against my skin—gently and with care—as my eyes found you for the first time. 

The world was moving, but in that moment, everything stood still. I barely had time to breathe before you stepped closer, your presence as light as the wind threading through the willow’s branches. You were wearing white, almost glowing in the sunlight. Your soft brown hair framed your face, and your eyes—warm, deep, and full of something I couldn’t yet name—met mine with quiet understanding. 

""Hey,"" you said, your voice soft, careful, as if you already knew exactly what I needed to hear. 

I turned toward you, the warmth of the sun paling in comparison to the quiet heat that spread in my chest. You radiated warmth—not just in the way you spoke, but in the way you smiled, a smile I could only see in your eyes. You were someone who, in a single word, made the world feel smaller and bigger all at once. 

We talked the rest of that evening, lost in the kind of effortless conversation that felt like it had been waiting to happen all along. We laughed, we joked, and something blossomed that day—something delicate, something new. When the sun began to sink, casting the sky in gold, I tucked a flower into your hair. And when you went home that night, you carried it with you, a quiet reminder of me. 

For weeks, it was just us beneath the summer sky. The days bled together in a haze of warm winds and quiet laughter. We talked about everything and nothing, filling the air between us with words that felt weightless and important all at once. The way you smiled, the way the sunlight caught in your hair—it never got old. It was simple, effortless, the kind of happiness that feels like it will last forever, even when you know it won’t. 

One afternoon, you sat beside me, closer than usual. The sun hung low in the sky, casting golden light through the branches. Without hesitation, without a second thought, you eased yourself onto my lap, settling there like you belonged, like this was the most natural thing in the world. 

The days stretched on, but even summer had its limits. The warmth in the air felt endless, but I knew it wasn’t. 

The last day before break snuck up on us, quiet and unannounced, like the final note of a song you don’t want to end. We lingered, sitting in the grass longer than usual, neither of us willing to acknowledge what came next. The wind was softer that evening, the light fading into something more fragile. 

And then, without a word, you stepped forward and wrapped your arms around me. It wasn’t a fleeting embrace, not a simple goodbye. It was something deeper—unspoken, but understood. You held onto me like you didn’t want to let go, like the day might last a little longer if we just stood there, together. 

I let my arms tighten around you, breathing in the faint trace of your perfume. I wanted to say something, something meaningful, something that would keep this moment from slipping away. But all I could do was hold you, hoping you felt everything I couldn’t put into words. 

When you pulled away, you smiled, though your eyes carried something else—something softer, sadder. 

""I’ll talk to you soon,"" you said, like a promise. 

I nodded, but as I watched you walk away, the wind stirring the leaves behind you, I couldn’t help but wonder if things would ever feel quite the same again.


Summer stretched out before me in highways and hotel rooms. The trip should have felt exciting—new places, new sights—but everywhere I went, there was an ache beneath it all. I saw things I wanted to tell you about. A sunset over the desert that painted the sky in soft pinks and oranges, so breathtaking it felt unreal. A quiet café in a small town, where the scent of coffee and old books reminded me of the way you’d tuck a loose strand of hair behind your ear while you read. The wind blowing through tall pine trees, wild and endless—I wondered if you’d love them as much as I did. 

Every time I saw something beautiful, my first thought was you. I wanted to send you pictures, to tell you what I was seeing, to hear your voice, to feel even a little closer. But distance has a way of making things feel fragile, like a connection stretched too thin. At night, I would lie awake thinking about us, about the way you fit so perfectly in my arms that last day. The road kept moving forward, but my heart stayed behind, somewhere beneath the skys we would lay together under.




Someone Worth My Every Word:


     I don’t remember exactly where I was when I found out—only how it felt. The world didn’t stop. The sun still hung in the sky, the warm air still wrapped around me, but everything inside me went cold. It was a quiet kind of devastation, the kind that doesn’t come with screaming or breaking things. Just silence. 

She wasn’t mine alone. 

I was the one who held her. The one who felt her warmth, who traced circles on the back of her hand, who pulled her close into my arms as wind whispered through the leaves. I was the one who kissed her, who made her laugh, who saw the way her eyes softened in the golden light. 

But I wasn’t the only one who had her heart. 

Somewhere, miles away, there was another man. A name I had never known, a presence I had never felt, and yet, he had been there all along. He wasn’t here to hold her, but he didn’t have to be. He had her words, her late-night thoughts, the part of her that I couldn’t reach. While I had been the one by her side, he had been the one in her heart. 

The realization came in pieces—offhand comments, messages that didn’t make sense until they did. I reread the words again and again, as if looking for some way to misinterpret them, some mistake that would make this anything but what it was. But there was no mistake. 

Every moment we had shared—the laughter, the touches, the whispered promises beneath the evening sky—had belonged to someone else, too. I wanted to be angry. I should have been angry. But all I felt was hollow, like something had been quietly stolen from me before I even knew to hold it tighter, And yet, despite it all, I couldn’t let go. 

Summer ended, but the weight of what I knew didn’t. When I saw her again, it was like nothing had changed. She smiled the same way, spoke with the same softness, held me like I was still hers and hers alone. But I wasn’t. Not really. We fell back into each other, as if the time apart had only made the pull between us stronger. And for a while, I let myself believe it. 

Let myself forget the quiet truth that lingered beneath every touch, every kiss. But it was always there, just beneath the surface. The night it all caught up to me, she was in my arms, her warmth pressed against me, her breath soft against my skin. It should have been perfect. It should have been just us.


But I wasn’t alone in that moment. 

Somewhere in the back of my mind, he was there. A shadow lingering in the space between us, unspoken but undeniable. I wondered if she thought of him, too. If she ever looked at me and saw something missing. 

I wanted to hold her closer, to pull her so deep into me that there would be no space left for anyone else. But love doesn’t work like that. No matter how tightly you hold on, you can’t erase the parts of someone you weren’t there for. 

That night, when she left, I sat in the silence and stared at my hands, at the empty space where she had just been. 

And then I wrote. 

I wrote to her, letter after letter, words spilling onto the page like they could somehow fix what was breaking. I told her why it had to be me, why we belonged together, why none of this could be real if it wasn’t meant to last. I told her how much it hurt, how much I loved her, how I couldn’t picture a future where she wasn’t mine alone. 

And I waited. 

Days blurred together, passing in slow, aching silence. Every unread message, every moment without a reply, felt like another piece of me unraveling. I told myself she needed time. That she was thinking, deciding, realizing what we had was real—was worth choosing.
And then, one night, she answered.
Not just with words, but with something deeper. Something undeniable.
She chose me. 

I don’t know if it was my letters, the weight of our memories, or something she had known all along but had been too afraid to face. But when she looked at me, really looked at me, I knew. It was in the way she held my hand, in the way she whispered my name, in the way she made the world feel whole again.
The uncertainty, the pain, the long nights spent wondering—they all melted away in the warmth of her touch. And for a while, it felt like that choice was enough.
Like love, once fought for, could finally be ours without question. 

Loving her felt like holding onto something delicate, something that wasn’t mine to keep. She was there—in my arms, in my laughter, in the quiet moments where our hands found each other in the dark—but not mine. Not in the way I wanted, not in the way that made this love feel safe. 

It was a strange kind of agony, to have almost everything and still feel the hollow ache of what was missing. I would catch glimpses of something real, something certain, in the way she looked at me when she thought I wasn’t watching. In the way her fingers lingered a little too long against mine. In the way she whispered my name, like it meant something more. But then there were the moments that made me wonder if I was just something comfortable. If I was the warmth she needed, but not the love she wanted. If I was still just a choice she hadn’t fully made. 

Because when I held her, I could feel it—the weight of something unspoken. And when she pulled away, I couldn’t help but wonder if she was always meant to leave. 

Some days, it felt like we were closer than ever. Other days, she felt like a stranger—one I had memorized but could never truly hold. I smiled when I was with her, laughed at her jokes, held her the way I had always dreamed of. But inside, I was unraveling. The uncertainty clung to me like a shadow, creeping into every quiet moment, every unspoken thought. It was exhausting, pretending not to care that I wasn’t hers completely. Pretending that I didn’t notice the hesitation in her voice when I asked where we stood. 

I was almost hers. Almost enough.
But almost wasn’t the same as being chosen.
And then, finally, she told me. 

""I'm not sure my parents will like you"" 

It should have felt like an answer, like something solid to hold onto. But instead, it felt like another condition, another checkpoint I had to pass just to prove what I already knew—I loved her. I had always loved her. 

But love wasn’t enough.
I nodded, smiled, told her I understood. But deep down, a quiet voice whispered a question I wasn’t ready to face:

Or was I just waiting for a door that was never meant to open?

I’ve cooked 16 dishes so far this week and I did get lucky by getting 4 crits until now.

I didn’t Berry Bomb and I didn’t use a single Helper Whistle. The only things I did do were stack Cooking Power-Up so I could cook Monday breakfast with +200 ingredients and spend the most of last week stocking up on ingredients for the Macarons. 700 inventory space is enough to hold 6 portions worth of Macarons along with the 200 extra ingredients for Monday breakfast. That allowed me to keep three slots of my team reserved for my healer and my HB+BFs Typhlosion and Marowak all week while using the other two slots to rotate around my Ing specialists to re-stock depleting ingredients for the Macarons.

Oh and I did have a Good Camp Ticket active and my area bonus for Taupe is already 75%. Pretty sure those were determining factors too.

Just wanted to share my experience as I was genuinely surprised how easy it was hitting M20 on Taupe, mostly thanks to the Valentines Event boost. FYI M20 on Taupe is 4,219,534 Snorlax Strength.",5,1739589390.0,PokemonSleep,3,1.0,False

As per tradition we can’t see each other on the wedding day, until the ceremony. 

But we will miss each other. We do everything together and the more important it is the more we will miss each other. So we made a secret pact to each sneak out from our respective family and friends at 11pm and meet at the local 24h burger joint for a dirty unhealthy snack and an unadvised coffee and part ways at 11.55pm! 

As well as being a bit naughty and fun it gives me a defined time to hand over the letter I want him to open the next morning, and for us to exchange any last minute information. Mostly though it’s a time to snatch the last truly private moment, before a crazy, and very un-private 24 that will change our lives forever.

I thought that might be an idea some of you could use.

TLDR: Can’t see the groom on the day of the wedding, because tradition and because we will be getting ready with our families. So we are gonna sneak out to meet in secret for the last moment of the day before (11pm-11.55pm).",16,1739589352.0,wedding,5,0.9,False

Here is my Valentine’s Day roller coaster.

Started the day with our usual Friday morning coffee date. Nice to be out with my
wife. I told her I had planned a date night for Sunday. She was happy about it…then said, next time we have a babysitter should go out with other friends. I’m all for it, but in Vday, it seemed to dismiss the planning I put in for Sunday.

Went from there to my weekly therapy appointment, where we talked through strategies for me letting my wife know how much I’m hurting in the DB. At one point towards the end of my session, my therapist said “this is really the first time I’ve heard you express your anger and hurt.” I didn’t realize I had been holding that in.

That sat with me all day as I went through my work day.

Got home from work, and my wife had set out a lovely spread for dinner for us and our son. On the table was the bottle of wine I gave her as a Valentine’s Day present the year before - which was the same bottle we had 21 years earlier for our first Valentine’s Day dinner. I was almost moved to tears that she remembered and put it out.

Then she asked if I was going to have any (I haven’t been drinking) and it became clear that she realized it was a nicer bottle but not anything special. I really wanted to cry.

The she gave me my Valentine’s Day present. I opened it up and it was a t-shirt…But she told me to wait to open the card.

Eventually, she went to read to our son for bed. I read the card and it was the most heartfelt card she’s given me in a long time, and my heart felt full from her expression of how much we’ve grown together this year and how we are finding our way back to each other.

Then she comes out, I’m sitting in the living room listening to a concert that is emotionally meaningful to me. I thank her for the card, and we make out for a bit. Then she opens my present, and then we make out even more.

Now she’s gone to bed, I’m sitting in the living room hoping she falls asleep soon so
I can go jack off.

We have our date night out planned for Sunday, and I’m considering telling her tomorrow night that I’m really hurting from the lack of physical intimacy.

Result:  
\# The Gospel According to Tex



Deep in the heart of Austin, Texas, where weirdness runs as freely as the Colorado River, a peculiar scratching emanated from behind a vintage wooden closet door in an old South Congress apartment. The door creaked open, revealing Tex—a nine-foot-tall creature covered in bluebonnet-colored fur with horns shaped like the Capitol dome.



Tex's first order of business in the mortal realm was to shuffle down to the corner of 6th and Congress, where Leslie Cochran had once held court in his signature thong and tiara. Using powers granted by the ethereal plane (and a healthy dose of Austin magic), Tex pressed a furry paw to Leslie's memorial plaque. In a flash of light that smelled distinctly of breakfast tacos, Leslie materialized, adjusting his tiara as if he'd merely been taking a disco nap.



""Well butter my biscuit and call me a unicorn,"" Leslie exclaimed, taking in Tex's magnificent form. ""You're just what this town needs to keep it weird!""



Together, they hatched a plan. Leslie, ever the entrepreneur, suggested they create AustinCoin—a cryptocurrency that could only be mined by performing random acts of kindness or teaching a stranger to two-step. The blockchain would be verified by a network of food trucks, and each transaction would be accompanied by a digital art piece featuring Tex in various Austin landmarks.



But as AustinCoin took off, something unexpected happened. During a late-night coding session at Mozart's Coffee Roasters, Tex had an epiphany while watching bat shadows dance across Lady Bird Lake. The monster picked up a copy of the Book of Mormon left behind by some missionaries who'd been scared away by Leslie's enthusiastic wardrobe choices.



By sunrise, Tex had read the entire book and decided to convert, though with some uniquely Austin modifications. The monster began preaching on South Congress, wearing a custom-made sacred garment over its fur, spreading a gospel that combined Mormon teachings with keeping Austin weird. Leslie, ever supportive, served as the first congregation's social director, organizing potlucks where green Jell-O was served alongside Franklin Barbecue brisket.



Today, if you find yourself in Austin, you might catch glimpse of a bluebonnet-colored monster in a tie, riding an electric scooter to Temple Square, or spot Leslie in his trademark attire leading a cryptocurrency seminar at a taco truck. And if you listen carefully on quiet nights, you can hear Tex's testimony echoing across Town Lake: ""I believe in keeping Austin weird, y'all, and that's the gospel truth.""",0,1739589205.0,AustinTX,0,0.4,False

1ipsah9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1ipsah9/hey_folks_i_desperately_need_advice_on_dating/,Hey folks... I desperately need advice on dating someone with bpd,"I wish I could add more flair. It's me getting ready to leave... she says she's getting ready to leave... but we have a kid together.. we've been together for over 2 years. It's my first long term relationship. But it's been rough. The first few months together we were already scream fighting. I'm not perfect. I have issues. Too. Hard depression and hard mistrust. I've never been in a relationship where I haven't been cheated on...but I seem to try to go after broken girls. Constant gas lighting from her... first couple months of the relationship, seemed good, then we had a fight. She doesn't drink, but would hang out with her best chick friend in the bar who was an alcoholic. At the time I was drinking at that bar. Invited her out. She showed up. 15 minutes in flipped out on me for making her come out when she had anxiety and screamed at me in the streets... I should have left that night... she got pregnate a few months in on accident. She didn't want more kids (she had 3) I didn't want any. On top of that my mom just died of cancer, and before dying she met this girl a few times and said she thinks she's the one... we kept the baby and my baby girl has been the best thing in my life... 
But.. here's where my issue is... the relationship has been nothing but her gas lighting me, and shoving all the responsibility on me. Stealing. Lying. Screaming at me. 
She hasn't paid a dime in bills since she moved in. 2 kids. A cat. I fed the kids. I took care of the kids. I moved her in because she couldn't get an apartment. I took her kids in because the dad dropped them off saying he was done. She doesn't seem to be able to handle being a parent. She is stressed 24/7 around kids, including my baby. I'm constantly getting my kid shoved back on Mr and her kids shoved on me because she can't handle them.. to a point it's unreasonable... like asking me 5 minutes before work to take the baby so she can sleep for a few hours... then screaming at me when I say I can't. Or screaming at me for not getting up at night with her when I'm the one working and paying bills.. this was when she had a job before the baby i was paying for everything and she told me i didnt do shit for her or her kids. Then she had the baby and i was the only one working. She constwntly told me she needed a job and how lucky i am to get to work... im a plumber in a place it hits negative degrees. I hurt alot every day. Come home and take over parenting so she can have a break. Even before my baby i was paying her gas and kods daycare because she wouldnt stop blowing her money.. then it was her freaking out because i act like my jobs so important. And id say yea it pays heat mortage keeping both our cars running with gas and i still give you money to play with. She wanted a job a year after baby was born and i said sure.. but all the jobs she looked at required me the sole income to drop to part time. And she didn't mention at all it was too help me. All i heard about was her tatoos she wanted her nails her clothes.. and its been that.. i pay grocerys unless she has a couple bucks to throw my way. But if its her nails or food for the kid she waits until the register to tell me... when i specifically said im broke and I heard for 2 weeks don't worry she has it.  Car seat? On me. Her car breaks down? Me. She has 3 prior kids, so i suggested we sell her little car she hates and get a suburban for our now 4 kids. Instead im buying it solo and shes going to buy a silverado to take her friends mud running and ditch jumping..on top of that..  she was stealing money from me... I would give her gas to go to get her kids.. and she would pocket some of the money instead of gas. And then ask for gas again the next day... for a while I was filling her tank every day... and if I asked her to stop driving so much she'd scream at me... it hurt more because at one point she said the gas pump charges a minimum fee then gives it back... I told her make sure to get it right back to me. I had zero money and our baby needed formula. She used it to buy cigarettes she was hiding smoking from me... not well tho. She left the packs around the house and would throw the butts in the yard.. but when I ask she would scream at me for asking. 
And this is how all our conversations go. I can see the switch in her. When the bpd kicks in as she says in our talks. It happens right away. I can't even say can we talk without her face changing to bpd and getting the nastiest shitty comments thrown at me... almost all of our fights are me saying hey this thing you did to me was super disrespectful can you stop, or it was really hurtful I didn't appreciate it. 
She doesn't. Instead she cuts me down and justifys it. Tells me I deserved it... screams at me... half the time she'll pick my kid up and take off out the door.... so if I put my foot down I know she'll take my kid from me... one day I stood between them because I knew it was coming and she sprinted through me hit and pushed me to pick her up. And then said I was just trying to tell her I loved her before I left. 
No. She was trying to take her... every fight is this way... and there all fights. We can't have a conversation without her getting nasty... yelling... the other day she started getting nasty to me because I was venting about work, and what she suggested would have got me fired. And when I said that she got angry it started a fight, and at one point she walked over to my kid and told her don't ever date a man like your father. I never got a sorry. Instead she said well I wouldn't want my kids finding a girl like me either. I've actually never heard sorry... she also does akot of say nasty things then leave the room. And when I try talking to her she screams at me for not giving her space and how conversations are always on my schedule. When I pointed out you can't just be shitty to me then say I can't say anything... and when you want a breather I give them to you... but when I come back to talk to them you need another breather. And another. And another. Lately every time she's mad at me she tells me she hasn't loved me in a long time.. then when she's not I'm her dream guy.... now i constantly ask if she still loves me and I'm getting yelled at for asking. And when I try to explain it's because she's back and forth every day I get yelled at more. 
I told her I was depressed the other day and she told me I needed to stop talking to her about it because she's depressed too and can't deal with mine on top of it... she knew I had depression.. and it's rare I talk about it... but any time I bring it up I get yea I got it too.
On top of that we don't do anything I like. Anything I'm interested in. If I even try bringing up something I want to try I get an instant I'm not interested in that. The entire relationship is about her. Not the kids not me no us everything is her... other guy has custody because when they split she needed to get her life together and left the kids... did it with the dad before that... now she's telling me she's been down this road 3 times and the fights don't stop so she needs to do what's best for her. He'll there was a period of time our fights were she wouldn't stop ditching me for her best friend.. who treated her like shit.. scream demand toxic as fuck.. my gf would get up mid us eating to go to her friends... and after a year of fighting over it I would hear things like mom said friends are important because they'll be there when your man leaves. 
Ok well that's because your mom wouldn't stop cheating on your dad and your man won't leave if you treat him better than you treat your friends. Fuck I was asking for just as good and not getting it... this isn't everything.. it's just the tip of the iceberg... it's fighting every day. I've been to hell and back for her... I've endured endless what feels like verbal abuse. Fuck one time she was telling me she never did something.. when I pulled a video out she snatched my phone out of my hands and put it in my coffee... no apology for that either.. just justification...

So my question is... I love her. I love her alot. The good days are good. But the bad days happen more often... I down played the bpd and didn't take it seriously... but the last few weeks I've been reading stories of other people dating bpd individuals, and how toxic they were, and sat here going hey this is me! This is what I'm going through!... how do I get through to her? How do I show her no the things your saying in the fights don't happen. The order your saying didn't happen. She'll even say I started the fight because I said this. And I'll look at her and go that's very clearly a statement that comes in mid conversation not at the beginning. I feel used. I feel like I'm just here for a place to live. I don't feel like she loves me. The other day she told me she doesn't like fucking me anymore. And she hasn't in a while.. and when I went i don't like it either... because I know you dont.. some how later it turned into I told her her pussy was dry and the sex was bad... and every time I suggest therapy she yells. I even said I'd go too. No she yells at me.. when I ask her to stop burning me so her life can be easy(litterally. She has nothing on the planet to worry about other than keeping the baby alive until I get home. And I normally take over) 
Folks.. how do I help her. How do I get her to see what's happening. How she treats me. I'll be begging to be treated better. Crying. And she'll keep telling me how I deserve it and she's perfect... what do I do anymore. I don't want to lose her. 

I'm sorry if this was a little all over... I'm always a big man. No crying. No outward emotion. Big tough blue collar biker.... today I'm distraught.. she did nothing for valentines day for me... and when I brought it up she said it's because we're fighting and she wasn't sure how I was feeling... I've been trying to talk to her all week about it what we should do and she keeps ignoring me.. she picked up a shift tonight instead. Wouldn't do anything before... later I brought up let's do it Sunday instead... her excuse all day after that was she didn't do anything because we're doing it sunday.... I changed it to Sunday to give her another shot... I got flowers..  sweet text messages. Sweet in person. I never got any of it back. Not even a happy valentines day... I said it multiple times and got a yea happy vday to you too... folks.. we've been together for 3 vdays.. the first one I said it wasn't a big deal to me.. she said it was. So I went all out. And she just accepted all the gifts the 100 dollar dinner everything I did to spoil her and went I didn't do anything because you said it wasn't a big deal... when I brought up multiple times it hurt all I got was you said it wasn't a big deal or well you only did this and this its Like you did alot. Nothing on fathers day.. not even sex.. but blew up at me on mother's day despite me being negative in my account for not getting her gifts..  seriously folks.. what do I do to get through to her, how do i help her.... I don't want to lose her.. I'll go through hell to help her... 

I seen another post and wanted to add... all these fights... every single one I have to apologize. If she wrong me or I wronger her or I was completely innocent or not. I apologize. And if I don't? She'll ignore me until I do. For days sometimes. Then she stays distant and treats me like shit for weeks for speaking up. If I say hey I don't like that you lied to me or stole then it's well I don't like that you this or that. She calls me a shit dad constantly. Everyone else says I'm the best dad they've ever seen. When she's not splitting I'm the best dad ever she never said that... also missed a big reason I've lost the want to have sex with her is if I'm in the mood she gets nasty. Calls me names. Tells Me about how it ruins her life how shitty I am only carrying about my dick when she has issues... instead of just saying she's not in the mood... and when she does fuck me it's definantily a well this is my duty I have to fuck you.  It's not fun sex. She has the attitude like she's being forced and I'm uncomfortable the whole time..

When my husband worked full time (we are retired now) and I worked part time I took out the trash, even hauled I to the dump on Saturday mornings, kept the house emaculate, had dinner on the table every single night when he came home. I did all the mowing (4 acres) and kept the gardening. Took care of ALL THE FINANCIAL needs. WE NEVER got evicted! And guess what? We never had NOT ONE SINGLE BILL paid for us! Never had our utilities paid, never got food stamps or ANY GOVERNMENT HELP because we were RAISED TO stand on our own!!!!

I still had time for my family and time with our  friends.

The only thing he had to do was eat, shower (YES EVERY NIGHT WE SHOWERED) and whatever he wanted to do.

1ips9na,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ips9na/my_pareidolia_has_ruined_another_valentines_day/,My Pareidolia has ruined another Valentine’s Day.,"When Taylor asked me out to dinner, I knew what was going to happen. Same thing that always happened when I went on a date. I really liked her, though. I thought maybe that could make a difference. 

Maybe, if I tried hard enough, I could just ignore it - just ignore *her*. 

I was wrong. 

\-------

Seated across from my date in the candlelit restaurant, I felt my phantom itch begin to flare up, setting the small of my back on fire. Taylor had been recounting her time in the police academy, but I couldn't follow what she was saying. The discomfort broke my concentration. As the itch's burning pleads intensified, my eyes darted around the dining room, horrified by what was appearing around me.

As expected, I had begun seeing the face everywhere.

It was in the pattern of our server’s tie, as well as on the red tablecloth beside me, formed from a very particular set of creases. It was on Taylor’s plate, as the arrangement of her half-eaten veal parmesan had created the image of a single bulging eye above a hooked nose.

Forcefully, I scratched the small of my back while keeping my eyes locked on Taylor, trying to keep this date afloat. Judging by her newly furrowed brow, I appeared to be doing a terrible job at hiding my distress, however. My clipped fingernails dragged against the burning patch of skin through my undershirt, but it was no use. No matter what I did, the sensation refused to yield.

The itch always gets worse when the face is around, and the face always comes around when I’m on a date.

Frustrated, I gave up on relieving the itch and brought my hand back to the table, accidentally knocking over my glass of Pinot Noir with the side of my wrist. It splashed onto my white napkin, staining it with the start of a familiar pattern. Taylor sprung to action, grabbing her napkin to help clean up the mess, but I intercepted her hand.

*“Wait…wait a second,”* I mumbled, eyes glued to the developing spill.

As the liquid lost momentum, I saw it; a crisply detailed face, framed by the white material like an impromptu watercolor painting or a purple-red Rorschach Test.

It was the same face that had haunted me since I was nineteen. The same snaggle-toothed smirk with the same bulging right eye, accompanied by the same sharply hooked nose connecting those two features.

*There she is,* I thought to myself.

Nervous sweat dripped down my face like condensation falling off a cold glass of lemonade on a sweltering day. I felt my lips quiver as I spoke, forming shaky words.

*“Taylor…I understand how this sounds, but…do you see anything on the napkin? Like…anything recognizable?”* I asked without looking up, gaze still fixed on the horrible stain.

*“Uhm…well, turn it towards me.”*

When I finally looked at her, she was squinting at the napkin, studying the crimson design. For a moment, I was gripped by a profound twinge of embarrassment, anxious thoughts popping into my head like rapidly growing weeds.

*Taylor’s a gorgeous, intelligent, remarkably kind woman. And I’m completely blowing my chance to make us into something. Don’t scare her off.*

A subtle change in her expression pulled me out of my self-loathing; a small tilt of her head complemented by a flicker of her eyes. It might have been recognition. She might have truly seen the face.

But I didn’t remain at that table long enough to ask.

As I blinked, Taylor’s face instantly disappeared, seamlessly replaced by the horrific visage I was asking if she could see in the stain. My body trembled with that one protruding eye glaring at me, bloodshot capillaries writhing like thin snakes under the white membrane. Before I could even think, a familiar phrase slipped out of the corner of her mouth, snaggletooth wiggling as those two familiar words became airborne.

*“You’re mine.”*

I let loose a scream, falling from my chair and onto the ground. Taylor jumped out from the table, rushing over to me with a look of concern painted on her *actual* face, but I was inconsolable. Wild with fear, I turned from her and started to run, briefly traversing the carpet on all fours like a rabid animal. By the time I was sprinting out of the restaurant, I had gotten to my feet, panting ragged breaths as I slid into the front seat of my car and sped off.

\-------

That was three months ago. She ended up paying for both of our meals. Not only that, but she had to Uber home since I had driven her there.

Needless to say, Taylor didn’t reach out to arrange a second date. 

There was one tiny silver lining, thankfully. Although we both work for the police department, our positions infrequently overlapped. I work in forensics, and she’s a uniformed officer. The times we did see each other, both assigned to the same crime scene, Taylor would give me a weak smile with a polite wave, and I would somberly reciprocate the gesture back at her.

Just another potential relationship ruined by my pareidolia.

\--------

Pareidolia: ***noun,*** \[pair-ahy-**doh**\-lee-*uh*\]

1) a situation in which someone sees a pattern or image of something that does not exist, for example, a face in a cloud.

\--------

I first saw that face about a decade ago, back when an actual person possessed it.

When I was nineteen, my family moved to a small town near my college. I didn’t love the arrangement. I mean, what freshman wants to be living with their parents? But I wasn’t paying my way through undergraduate, so I had little room to complain.

Ms. Besthet lived in the house across from us. From what I understand, she had been perfectly normal before we moved in. A pillar of the community, even.

She was in her late forties and worked as a professor of literary studies at my college. She went to church every Sunday, and she donated a quarter of her salary to the local children’s hospital. Ms. Besthet was childless and unmarried, but that was the only societal deficiency in her otherwise perfect record.

I never met *that* woman, though. I met someone else about a week after we moved in.

While unpacking my bedroom upstairs, I heard my mom calling me. She hollered for me to come down - one of our new neighbors had stopped by to introduce herself.

Jogging down the stairs, I followed the scent of freshly brewed coffee into the kitchen. Ms. Besthet was sitting at our table, her back to me as I approached.

*“Oh! And here he is now. This is my son, Grant,”* my mother remarked, lifting her mug and pointing it in my direction.

The middle-aged woman shifted in her chair, turning to meet me. At first, her expression was unremarkable; warm and friendly, nothing more. But when our eyes met, something changed. Ms. Besthet’s face twisted into a picture of ecstatic bliss. Her cheeks became rosy and flushed. Her eyes beamed, gleaming with undiluted euphoria. I think I even saw a tear trickle down the side of her nose before the effects of the stroke started to appear.

Love at first sight and its collateral damage, I guess.

As her brain swelled and suffocated, completely deprived of oxygen, Ms. Besthet’s face contorted from elation into the ghastly expression that has tormented me for the last ten years.

Without a word, she collapsed to the floor. My mother screamed for me to stay with Ms. Besthet as she hurried out of the kitchen, running to call 9-1-1 from her cell phone that had been charging in the living room.

Paralyzed from the abject horror of it all, I found myself unable to leave Ms. Besthet’s side, even though I certainly wanted to. Instead, I just stared at her, wondering if this odd woman was really about to die in front of me. Two words escaped from her lips before she lost consciousness, whispered from her crumpled position on the ground, her single open eye fixed squarely on me.

*“You’re mine.”*

\--------

Ms. Besthet didn’t die that day, but when she returned home from the hospital a month later, she was a different person, apparently.

To this day, I can’t figure out whether the stroke caused her newfound obsession, some bizarre manifestation of her brain damage, or whether her newfound obsession caused the stroke, desire short-circuiting her nervous system like an old car battery. I suppose the order doesn’t actually matter. Whatever happened that day, the end result was the same.

The woman had become downright infatuated with me.

Every afternoon, I’d see her at her front window, curtains wide open, waiting for me to return from class, anchoring her gaze to me the second I stepped out of my car. The stroke had damaged her nerves, leaving the left half of her face paralyzed. Meaning that, when she stared at me, it’d only be through her right eye, bulging from how intensely she was watching.

Months later, once her strength had more or less returned, Ms. Besthet resumed teaching at my college. Tried to resume teaching, at least. Sometimes she’d actually show up to her classes, sometimes she wouldn’t. As it would happen, the sessions she missed were during the times that I was also on campus. Instead of attending her own lectures, I’d catch her peering at me from around hallway corners or through the cracks of slightly opened doors, always scampering away once I caught on to her enamored surveillance.

The college didn’t fire her. Instead, without warning, she voluntarily resigned. The day after she quit, Ms. Besthet went missing. Disappeared without a trace. Didn’t pack a bag, didn’t take her car. She just vanished.

Many of my neighbors were worried sick, while I was secretly relieved. I didn’t care where she had gone, and I wasn’t preoccupied with the possibility that something bad had happened to her.

Wherever she was, Ms. Besthet was finally leaving me alone. 

Or she was being less obvious about it, at least.

A few quiet weeks passed before I heard a loud *thump* on our living room window, home alone while my parents were out of town. I had fallen asleep on the couch watching a movie, but the strange noise yanked me awake. My eyes, still hazy from sleep, looked over to a nearby digital clock, which showed the time was two in the morning. As my vision became clearer, I noticed something that made the hairs on the nape of my neck stand on end.

I saw the faint silhouette of a person, leaning against the living room window from the outside. Not only that, but they had pressed their body so hard against the glass that the sound of it had woken me up.

Terror vibrating in the back of my throat, I crept over to the window. The bright flickering images from our wide-screen TV cast inky shadows that danced over me as I moved through the room. When I finally stood in front of the silhouette, inches away from the glass, my entire body buzzed with fear and anticipation.

I twisted the blinds open.

But, to my surprise, there was no one there. All I saw through that window was an empty cul-de-sac, dimly lit by phosphorescent streetlights.

An involuntary sigh of relief billowed from my lungs, and I let the tension in shoulders fall like an avalanche of muscle and ligament down below my collarbone.

The relief didn’t last.

When I was about to turn away, I noticed a smudge on the glass. It wasn’t easy to see in the low light, but once I saw it, I couldn’t look away. I tried to suppress my recognition of the shape, but it was too perfectly identical to be anything other than an imprint of Ms. Besthet’s face.

Two months later, some kids stumbled upon a decomposing body in the woods behind my house.

According to the police, it looked like Ms. Besthet had been living there since her disappearance. The authorities eventually ruled her death a tragic accident; starvation in the setting of psychosis.

I wouldn’t learn this until years later, but the only thing she had on her person when she expired was a polaroid camera. A detective that worked the case let that fact slip in passing, gushing about how strange it all was, unaware that I lived less than a hundred yards from where the woman had simply laid down and died.

When I asked him if she had any photos with her, he refused to tell me more.

*""I've said too much already, sorry.""*

\--------

From a dating perspective, my twenties have been hellish. Echoes of Ms. Besthet’s face have stalked me since the day she died. Under normal circumstances, it’s an infrequent disturbance. Once a month, maybe. But if I ever find myself flirting, though, imprints of her face will start proliferating in my surroundings, swirling around me like a swarm of wasps.

And if I’m ever stupid enough to actually go on a date? Multiply all of that by twenty.

Not to mention the goddamned itch. In the end, that’s what really stopped me from pursuing romance. I think I could ignore the faces; however numerous they’d become. It’d be difficult, but I could do it. The itch is a different story. At peak intensity, it’s like my skin is burning from an invisible fire that won’t go out. The discomfort can completely overwhelm me to the point where I would do anything to make it stop.

So, I’ve resigned myself to isolation. Dating just hasn’t been worth the pain. It’s been lonely, sure, but abstaining has kept me safe and relatively sane. Meeting Taylor, however, changed things. Taylor rekindled something inside me that I believed was completely extinguished before I met her. She made me want to fight back.

That was delusional.

A misjudgment I won’t be making again.

\--------

Over the last two weeks, I’ve been daydreaming about Taylor. We’ve had some casual conversations since that disaster of a first date, and I realized that I’ve given her nothing in the way of an explanation for my behavior that night.

Yesterday, though, I made a resolution.

I would ask Taylor to meet me for coffee the day *after* Valentine’s Day. Asking her to coffee *on* Valentine’s Day would be a little strange, I thought. I didn’t plan on explaining everything to her, but I could at least apologize for leaving her high and dry. Maybe pay her back for dinner and the Uber. If she seemed receptive to all that, and if I found a bit of courage, maybe I’d ask her if she was willing to give us another try.

Satisfied with the plan, I continued through my workday.

A few hours later, I was called in to assist with a case - a dead body discovered in the middle of a nearby park that had everyone scratching their heads.

When I arrived on scene, I understood their confusion.

The corpse was propped up against a tree, its details initially obscured by the tree’s shadow. Honestly, it was hard to even tell it was a human body from where I parked, which was only twenty feet away. At that distance, the thing looked more like a burlap sack filled with ground beef than it did a human cadaver.

When I approached, however, I started to appreciate its humanity. A fractured bone jutting out here, a few fingers poking out there. Somehow, the corpse had been twisted into an incomprehensible sphere of mangled flesh and bone. It was like God had taken this poor soul, placed them between the palms of their comet-sized hands, and rolled them until they were molded into a ball like human pizza dough.

But that wasn’t even the strangest part: the corpse lacked decay, meaning that whoever they were, they were freshly dead. Our lead detective had initially assumed that we were standing on the crime scene, given how recently we had presumed they died. At the same time, the scene was *completely* bloodless, which argued against that theory. Not a speck of it on them, not a speck of it around the tree.

No blood that we could see, at least. Despite what we all see in the movies, blood sprays aren’t always obvious.

I opened my forensics toolbag and pulled a spray bottle of luminol from it. If there was even a drop to be found, the chemical would react with it, oxidizing the molecular iron present in blood, resulting in a faint blue glow. Thankfully, the large tree’s shadow completely covered the victim. To properly see the glow, I needed the area to be dark.

As the liquid contacted the corpse, parts of it did glow. 

Moments later, the lead detective put a gentle hand on my shoulder and said something that nearly caused me to pass out. I hadn’t heard him approach, transfixed by the shape that had appeared after I sprayed the luminol.

*“We found the victim’s wallet in the nearby brush. I think…I think you knew her.”*

I didn’t need him to continue, but I didn’t stop him, either. When I saw the imprint of Ms. Besthet’s face glowing on the corpse like a cosmic stamp of approval, I already knew what he was about to tell me.

*“It’s…it’s Taylor.”*

My memory of the next few minutes is a bit jumbled. I have a very fuzzy recollection of driving home. It consists mostly of my own feral screams filling the car with unearthly noise, rather than a memory of the drive itself.

Everything becomes clear again when I walked through the door of my apartment. As soon as my foot passed that threshold, I felt the phantom itch abruptly manifest on the small of my back, worse than it’s ever been before. Struggling to move, I stumbled through my apartment, scratching wildly at the area as I did, clawing at the skin with reckless abandon. Eventually, I made my way into the bathroom.

As I unbuttoned my shirt, an entirely new pain came into being. It wasn’t the pins and needles of an unmanaged itch; the discomfort was too sharp. It caused me to double over in agony, leaning my elbow against the rim of the sink to keep myself upright. I wasn't even scratching anymore, and yet the pain was still escalating, as if I was manually peeling thick strips of meat from around my spine with my hands. I felt the tearing sensation making a line across my skin, inch by tortuous inch.

In a frenzy, I ripped my shirt off and turned my back towards the mirror, desperate to identify the source of the new pain. What I witnessed in that moment broke me completely.

A laceration was forming, completely on its own, unzipping layers of skin before my eyes, the tissue audibly splitting and popping in my ears.

Above the impossible wound, there was a single brown mole about the size of a nickel. There was also an old scar from a biking injury, below the mole but above the laceration; a fibrinous line running between the two landmarks, connecting them to each other.

An eye, a hooked nose, and a bloody smirk.

As I noticed it, the lacerating paused, and the room became quiet.

I watched helplessly as the lips of the gash began moving, causing jolts of debilitating pain to radiate through my back, silently mouthing those two horrible words.

*“You’re mine.”*

As the title says, I am in love with my best friend of almost a decade. We’ve been friends since high school, and I realized one day that I loved him. This is quite a sticky situation though. . . I am going to try to summarize this in places of the story so it doesn’t take too long to write or read. It’s still a long story, so get some water and a snack, and get cozy. Please read through the full post before commenting or judging. 

Here it goes: we first met during our Sophomore year (2018) of high school in art class. We met differently than I know what you’re all expecting. The thing is, I was already in a relationship with my “high school sweetheart”; we’ll call him Ex. And Best Friend was talking to, and soon dating, Glasses. How we actually met was my other best friend was curious as to who our mutual friend Glasses was talking to. His ex was a bit of an ass, so she wanted to watch out for him. I told her that we had an art class together so Bestie, asked me to “investigate” Best Friend. I said yes, obviously. A couple classes later, and I see him. He was rude, whiny, complained to the teacher and students alike, and basically acted like a 7 year old. I especially noticed the way he talked back to the teacher when she asked him about an assignment he refused to do according to the guidelines. I reported back to Bestie whenever anything happened for about a week, and we decided we did not like Best Friend. 

Only a few days later, Glasses introduces Best Friend, and he was someone else! We mistook Teenage Man Child for Best Friend! Best Friend ended up being this amazing guy. He was cute, super sweet, a bit flirty, had the funniest laugh, cool hobbies, and of course he long boards. He caught my eye immediately. Bestie and I were relieved. We all, for the most part, became friends. Best Friend and I started hanging out more, and even sat next to each other in art class. Did I also mention that Ex was in art with us too? Best Friend even became friends with Ex. We all would hang out during and after school from time to time. Glasses and Best Friend broke up after only a few weeks, and all was well after a few more had passed. I hung out with Best Friend a bit more as we ended up living strangely close to each other. 

Fast forward to Junior Year, Best Friend and I are much closer, had more classes, and hung out even more. I discovered that Best Friend was a bit of a player, and I was starting to crush on him during that time. I felt like a bad person as I was still with Ex, though I no longer had feelings for him. Then comes 2020, and part way through the second semester comes Covid 19 and the Quarantine. I was struggling, so was the rest of the world. I was stuck in a toxic household and relationship. Quarantine ends, we all go back to school a couple months later. I get sick, get sent home only to discover I have pneumonia, and thankfully not Covid. Best Friend was the one of the only two friends who checked up on me while I was sick. I’m back to school, Bitch Friend yells at me for something stupid again, and I decide I’m done hangout with them. They weren’t real friends anyways. Ex and I start nagging out with Best Friend and his group of friends soon after. Something significant happened between Best Friend, Ex and I. 

Now it’s Senior year. I was told by my egg donor at some point to stop seeing Best Friend as she could tell there was something going on. Ex and I broke up for a few weeks during the late fall early winter partially as a result to this. I wasn’t too sure of my feelings yet though as I didn’t know what love felt like. During those weeks Best Friend flirted with me a bit more than usual. Best Friend was also in another situationship with a guy we’ll call John. I wanted to flirt back a bit, but it was so soon after Ex, and he was with John. I then had a pregnancy scare, stupidly got back with Ex even though I didn’t want to be with him for the better half of the relationship. Best Friend was mostly normal, a bit distant, and went right back to John. Ex suddenly dropped out of high school during the last semester of the last year, stupidly I stayed with him. Best Friend and I became MUCH closer during that time. Ex wasn’t super happy about that as he was the somewhat jealous and insecure type, though he hid it for the most part. 

Summer (2021) arrived, high school was finally over. Best Friend and I graduate without Ex and he becomes bitter and resentful. They had gotten jobs, and I was going to college. Ex was fired for failing his drug test which was unsurprising. Household becomes worse, I can’t handle Ex anymore, begin questioning if I ever loved him, began to dislike him and men in general, and even questioned if I was gay because I disliked men so much. I only trusted Best Friend. I went to a lake party with Best Friends and all his friends, and theirs and so on. I purposely didn’t invite Ex because he was a party pooper like no other. He was very negative, wouldn’t want me to socialize with guys unless he was around, even for school assignments, and just had a habit of bringing the mood down whenever he was around. Ex found out eventually and was obviously not happy. He didn’t want me hanging with Best Friend as much for understandable reasons. Christmas comes around, he crashes and stays the night without my permission, and I hated that night. I FINALLY dumped him after New Years, because I knew for I couldn’t handle it anymore. I was free to do whatever I wanted now. I got a job, went on dating apps, had little success, hung out with Best Friend a little less since we were both working. We were growing up, and slightly away from each other. 

The summer before I turned 19 (2022), Best Friend and I finally talk about something that happened between him, Ex 1 and I during high school. We then spoke about the fact that he had kissed both me and my Ex before. Yep, we’re all LGBT+, and no we’re not theatre kids. I never told him how I think about that moment constantly. We were alone at a friend’s helping out while they were away, and the tension between us was thick enough to cut with a knife. A couple months later, I met the worst mistake of my life. He tried to drive a wedge between Best Friend and I. I regretfully told Ex 2 that Best Friend was gay so that he wouldn’t freak out as he was much worse than Ex 1. Best Friend and I hung out anyways, but things became awkward with Ex 2 around. I also dumped Ex 2 after New Years for other reasons. Also another story for another day, and another post. Best Friend was elated for me to have left Ex 2, but acted differently when I then told him that I believed I was gay. He wasn’t as flirty, stopped trying to hold my hand, etc. It was to be expected of course, though part of me was disappointed. Why was I disappointed if I was gay?

It’s 2023, and Best Friend and I are still very close. Constantly hanging out, going to each other’s places to game, etc. Only, we held hands, called each other babe here and there, and even spooned. I ended up moving that summer though, all the way to the other end of the state we live in. Now, instead of being a few minutes away, we were 10 hours away from each other. We lost contact for a bit due to the situation that was happening to my family up north. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to share that story. Best Friend and I still make an effort though. We sent each other short videos and texts, we played our games together over the long distance, he told me about his pets and kept me updated on mine, etc. Now, all the way to the summer of 2024, a year after I moved. Bestie was getting married! I went back to my hometown for the wedding, and to catch up with loved one’s. I was at my sister’s place when Best Friend and I saw each other again for the first time in over a year. He picked me up by my waist and swung me around like it was a movie. 

I had to wrap my legs around him to not fall off. He placed his hands on my waist and upper thigh, dangerously close to my cheeks. Then he suddenly set me down, we talked, hugged, and then went inside after a few minutes. While we played games with my sister and her roommates, he leaned back onto my thighs to use them as a sort of cushion. I was laying down on my side on the sofa bed thing, and he was just a little in front of me. He turned slowly to tell me I was very comfortable, and snuggled into my legs. Sister and her Roomies looked at me like they knew something I didn’t. Then comes Bestie’s wedding! Best Friend wasn’t able to make it as my plus one, but he picked me up to drive me there. His jaw dropped when he saw me, and he told me I looked beautiful. Then the whole car ride there, he was leaning towards and looking at me. I had to remind him to keeps his eyes on the road. I’ve never felt so pretty being covered head to toe. 

A few hours later, and I’m back at my sisters. Best Friend arrives late at night with some drinks. We get comfy, smoke a few joints, and are sitting basically on top of each other. His eyes were on me the whole time, and at one point my legs were draped over his. We’re talking, laughing, doing our thing, when I turned away for a moment for a reason I can’t remember. I felt a tiny movement, and then an inhale by my neck. He had leaned into me so close that his nose was brushing against the skin of my neck. I turned and oh my god the eye contact. Our faces leaned closer, and then our friend walked in with her boyfriend, ruining what could have been. Tensions were still running high between Best Friend and I, and soon he had to go. He almost slept over, but Best Friend and I have hated Sister’s roommates dog since she attacked my dog. He left, and then we hung out again a couple days later. We talked about our mental health, the situation up north, and other personal topics such as a couple of his conquests as I call them. I don’t remember why, but he told me he had always thought I was very hot. Soon after, my trip was over and we had to say goodbye. 

Only a few months later in the fall, I was headed back up north due to the passing of a family member. Best Friend was working the day of the funeral and couldn’t be there. So, we met that evening at my sister’s to talk about the family member, and catch up on other topics. That night though, he stayed on the couch with me. At some point in the night we both woke up, and he asked me to cuddle. I was regretfully too tired to talk and missed my chance! Morning came, and we woke up. He said he was cold, and I agreed. He told me to come over and cuddle with him. We were cuddling close together on the small couch, his arms were around my waist, and at some point his hand slipped to my butt. He left it there for a moment, then said sorry, but I told him it was ok. Then my damn sister came in and flopped on top of us! While the moment was ruined, it was fun dog piling with them. Best Friend told me I was the only person who could get him to sleep around that damn dog. He had to leave soon for his family’s Thanksgiving plans. I was left missing being in his arms. 

A few days later, I was his plus one for his sister’s baby shower. It was there where I met more of his family, and led them all to believe I was his girlfriend! During the shower, Best Friend introduced me to family, bragged about me, and kept me close to him. He even did the K Drama romantic-swing-around-and-swoop-her-down thing when the male lead catches the female lead. He did that in front of his mom, sisters, and cousins. Though he accidentally swung my head into the cabinet which led me to tease him while his family was cooing at us and saying how cute. 
At some point we were outside talking to some cousins when he set his hand on the small of my waist, gently slid his hand further down, and left it there for a good 20 seconds. We slipped away after playing some of the party games, having a few shots, and impressing everyone with my spice tolerance. He even got me a dark green jacket when I said I was cold because he thought it would look nice on me, which it did and it was super fuzzy inside. 

We went to smoke some joints in the back where I saw all the stars in the night sky. There was little light pollution there and I began my old habit of chatting the constellations from memory. He asked which ones were which and I tried to show him, but couldn’t get a good angle just pointing. So I decided to be a little bold, and pressed my back against him, rested my head in the crook of his next, and then began pointing to the stars once more. We stayed like that for a good 10 minutes, snuggling into each other’s warmth while I charted the stars for him. 
Eventually we went back inside to his bedroom. I walked by him in the room, and he told me I smelled sweet like vanilla. I said it was jasmine and decided to be bold by asking him if he wanted a closer smell. I gave him my wrist and he smelled it while holding eye contact. After that, we watched cheesy horror movies and ate tres leches cakes on his bed. At some point, I can’t remember why exactly, he told me he didn’t want to make me uncomfortable since I way “gay,” but I confessed to him that I wasn’t. I just hated men for a long time because of my exes and other men in my life. He tensed up, and we continued to watch the movies. 

We got tired and he had to get up early the next day for a family trip out of town. I borrowed some of his clothes to sleep in, and we almost shared the bed. Our backs were against each other under the covers, and then he said he would sleep on the floor so that he wouldn’t fall off. We fell asleep facing each other, and woke up when his fish tank flashed back on at 5 am, which was an hour before the alarm lol. When we woke up the second time, he told me I looked like a Barbie. We drove to a nearby coffee shop and back to my sister’s in silence. There we said goodbye, and that he would try to stop by one last time before my flight. He wasn’t able to show. When I got back to where I live now, we even talked about getting married for his green card and moving in together. Like, we literally planned a future together. We talked about what kind of house we would have, what type of gardens, where we’d put the animals, etc. He said that in regard to getting married, his family wants him to marry me too! And he didn’t say no, only a not now because I was so far away and planning to go back to school and that he didn’t want to hold me back. . . 

And now to a few days ago. My friend and coworker was reading this after I showed it to her, and she got his number from my phone. She sent him a text telling him I have feelings for him, which I knew about. She sent it to him, and he left it on read! He has also stopped responding to my messages as well. Am I delusional or could there really be something between us?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I did all my usual strategies and went to bed expecting to feel better in the morning, which is what usually happens. I woke up on Friday still feeling pretty out of it but I thought recovering. I had some toast and a small coffee and sat on the couch. I started feeling really out of it, nauseous, super faint and hungry. My partner had to carry me to bed. I threw up. Then it was like I lost control of my body. My mind was still clear but I couldn't get my limps to do anything and I could barely keep my eyes open. My partner tried to get me to drink water but I couldn't get my body to do it. Eventually he carried me into the shower and put on the cold water. That seemed to help a bit. Then he got me out and put on my compression socks. Eventually I could drink again. Then I slept for a few hours and when I woke up I was weak and had a headache but I could talk again.

Counter space is not a concern.  I’d buy something like a Breville Express, but the built in hopper/grinder creates a problem with the regular vs decaf preference.

I am a fan of waking up early. I have slipped up on my 5AM routine this month, though. The **#1 reason** I strongly advocate waking up at 5 or earlier is the *few* moments of sanity one can breathe in, before the day starts for everybody else in the family.

My family, my neighbourhood, my locality - all of it is one big ruckus circus that starts off around 9 in the morning, cools off a little in the afternoon when people nap, and reaches its **noise crescendo climax** in the evening. Waking up at 5 gives me at least an hour to be a human ""*being*"", instead of a human ""*doing*"".

I can make my coffee at snail's pace, without being egged on to finish my job in the kitchen faster and make space for others. I can take my coffee down to the garden and sit in the sun, without being asked several questions about the whereabouts of things. I can look at birds in the trees and watch them have conversations with each other. I can sip my coffee and enjoy each of its flavour notes without being warned about the adverse health effects of coffee.

I can be in my head when it is quiet for once - before the garbage truck rolls in with its theme music, the washing lady comes in and starts clanking utensils against each other (I am grateful for her, though), the cat comes over to beg for a second breakfast, my family wakes up to ask a slurry of questions.

Currently, I am having a big piece of chocolate cake (for breakfast - I am an adult with free will now haha) and some coffee, listening to 'Married Life' from Up - it is still way too later than 5 AM but it is a start. Back to the grind.

How do you like spending your first hour after waking up? ",2,1739587769.0,Productivitycafe,3,1.0,False

1iprvzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1iprvzw/a_little_guidance_needed/,A little guidance needed,"Hello all!

I feel like I've stalked this subreddit for a while and am wondering if I could get a little advice. I'll give a bit of backstory, so apologies if it's a bit long.

My introduction to Orthodoxy was quite random. I remember scrolling through Instagram and coming across an account of an Orthodox woman sharing her faith, daily life, memes, etc. In one of her reels, she mentioned the book The Way of a Pilgrim. At first, I didn’t think much of it, but as an avid reader with a curious streak, I looked it up.

What struck me in my research was how split the reviews were. It seemed people either loved the book or hated it. Naturally, I got my hands on a copy as soon as possible—and I loved it. The concept of unceasing prayer was so foreign yet so riveting. I had to learn everything I could about the Orthodox faith.

This was around September 2023. Then, at the beginning of December 2023, I was laid off—completely unrelated and unexpected—but I was able to get on unemployment, which was a blessing. I mention this because, during this newfound free time while job searching, I was able to delve deeper into my studies.

I read Kallistos Ware and Anthony of Sourozh, got the Orthodox Study Bible and a prayer book, and explored most of the books and links recommended in the subreddit—but it wasn’t enough. I found an Orthodox church fairly close to me and reached out to the priest. I sent an email with a few questions and decided to attend Liturgy to gain a better understanding.

I was fortunate that the Liturgy was in English, so I had no trouble following along. To say it was a new experience is an understatement. While my family believes in the Christian faith, we never really attended church beyond the occasional funeral or wedding, so I had no idea what to expect.

I’ll be honest—I was blown away. I loved every minute of the Liturgy. I even stayed for the coffee hour on my first visit. Everyone was welcoming and kind. I didn’t feel out of place at all, which was a huge relief since I tend to psych myself out of new opportunities due to anxiety.

I kept attending every Sunday, and my family was so shocked that they all had to come and see at least once. My first visit was on Easter Sunday of 2024. Looking back, I have no idea why I chose that date, knowing they followed a different calendar, but I had it in my mind that this was when I needed to go.

Now, here’s the problem: I haven’t attended another Liturgy in about six months, maybe longer. I’m physically able to go, and as a grown adult, no one is stopping me—yet I just can’t go.

There have been Sundays when I’ve woken up on time, gotten ready, put my hand on the front door—only to turn back around and stay home. I have no idea why. The only thing I can think of is that the last time I attended, I might have had a mild panic attack. I don’t know what triggered it or even if that’s what it was. I’m an anxious person, sure, but I’ve never experienced panic attacks before, so I truly don’t know what happened.

I’ve tried talking to my family and friends about it—most of whom, even if they aren’t religious, have some kind of spirituality—but no one can pinpoint an explanation. I wondered if I jumped in too fast and scared myself, but there was no external pressure. Everyone I’ve encountered has given me space to acclimate, which I deeply appreciate, making this all the more confusing.

I guess I’m asking if this has happened to anyone else, and if so, how did you overcome it? I still love the faith and refuse to give up my pursuit, but I feel lost. I’ve been advised to reach out to the priest again, and I do think that’s my next best move—but I genuinely don’t know what to say. I’ve written and erased so many emails at this point.

At this stage, I think I’m more embarrassed than anything. This whole situation is hard to put into words. If anyone has advice or guidance, I’d be deeply grateful.",1,1739587660.0,OrthodoxChristianity,5,1.0,False

1ipru5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1ipru5y/theres_something_out_there_in_the_storm_pt_2/,There's Something Out There in the Storm [Pt. 2],"When we finally returned to base, I parked the plow in the shed. The others were still on their way back, chattering over the radio about updates on the storm and the corpse they’d found. Killing the engine, their voices fell silent.

The commander and I headed inside, stripping our excess gear in the locker room before continuing to his office. The compound, while larger than Outpost Delta’s cabins, was most likely constructed on a similar budget. Crude floorboards with sections of ceramic tile in the bathrooms and kitchen. Narrow hallways to the north and south of the building with sleeping quarters, a communication center, and medical bay tacked onto them. At the center, perhaps the largest section, was the common room. It was populated by bookshelves, a flatscreen TV that didn’t work, a dining area, lounge chairs, two couches, an air hockey table in which one of the paddles was missing, and a pool table. There was a second building with a lab where all of the eggheads worked, but they had all been granted temporary leave for the holidays while we were to remain and keep the central base active.

The buildings were well-insulated. Possibly the most expensive cost during initial construction if you didn’t include our equipment and gear. As a result, if the bases didn’t reek of chemicals and cleansers, they usually smelled like last night’s dinner. Since it was Ludwig’s week for cooking, there was a lingering odor of canola oil and fried meat.

We exited the locker room and headed for the northern hallway. At the end of the corridor was the armory where I disposed of my rifle and ammunition. The commander, as usual, retained his revolver. Possibly out of forgetfulness, but more than likely, out of habit. Unlike the rest of us, it wasn’t unusual for him to keep his firearm whether it was deemed necessary or not. It may as well had been surgically attached to him.

“We’ve gotta turn up the ventilation,” the commander muttered as we stepped into his office. “I can practically taste sausage.”

“I’ll make sure it gets done, sir,” I said, connecting the hard drive to his computer.

While he sat there reading Emma’s final document, the others came into the compound, shivering from the cold and complaining. They stamped snow from their boots and removed their coats, putting them on hangers in their lockers. Ludwig took his samples into the medical bay for safe-keeping, Javier not far behind talking about what they should do for the remainder of the night. Ludwig proposed a game of snooker and some drinks to help stave off the cold. This seemed to entice the others with only Arianna resigning herself to spectate. Unless it was a board game or movie, she didn’t care to participate in their antics. I couldn't blame her.

Watching them go about their usual activities relieved me though. It was better to have them distracted than panicking. Although, I imagined the panic would ensue once the commander had finished the document. Once they started to converse amongst themselves about what happened in the outskirts.

Until then, I closed the door to the commander’s quarters and locked it, taking a seat across the room, patiently waiting for him to finish.

This moment arrived when the commander remarked: “Fuckin’ hell.” He tapped at the arrow keys to scroll back up to the top of the document. “You think this is real?”

“I believe so, sir.” I shifted uncomfortably in my seat, reimagining the story’s events as they unfolded in my thoughts. “There’s enough evidence to support it.”

He stared at the monitor, his eyes moving across the screen as he re-read the first few passages. The matchstick between his teeth bobbed with his flexing jaw. A vein throbbed on his forehead, bulging against the skin.

“Aliens,” he said in disbelief. Almost disgusted. “Give me a fuckin’ break.”

“Foreign entity,” I amended, not that it sounded much better. “Singular, as far as I’m aware.”

“Infects the mind, takes control of the host, sounds like absolute rubbish to me.”

“If you really believe that, then why don’t we head back out and continue digging?” I proposed, hoping the commander wasn’t so witless as to accept my bluff. “See for ourselves what'sactually out there.”

He scoffed and pushed away from his desk, standing and crossing the room to a cabinet in the back. “Don’t tempt me, Sonya. I’ll send you personally if that’s what you want.”

“Sorry, sir. I was just trying to make a point.”

“Point well-received, yeah.”

He dug through the cabinet and removed a whiskey bottle from his personal stash. He angled the bottle towards me, but I refused with a shake of my head.

“It’s probably best if we don’t share food or drinks.”

“We’re already breathin’ the same air, Sonya. We were all there; all exposed.”

“Still, we’re not entirely sure how this thing operates. Whether it can pass from one host to the next, or if the infection has to come directly from the source. We also don’t know the range of exposure.”

Unscrewing the cap, he took a drink and exhaled. “I’d kill for a smoke right now.”

“Pretty sure Ludwig might have some,” I offered, which was comical considering his position amongst the team. “I don’t know if I’d recommend it though.”

“Right, minimizing contact and all that.” He raised his hand and rubbed at his bald head. “What’s our next move then?”

I’d wondered when this would come about. Furtively, I’d been dreading it ever since the drive back.

“Way I see it, we have a couple of options,” I said. “We can tell the American company about the entity, about what happened to their skeleton crew, but…”

“But then we risk their curiosity. That they might send a team for closer examination. Inquisitive bastards. What else?”

“We can lie and say they died from natural causes.”

“A fickle lie at best, and they’d still send someone to investigate. We’re short on time here. Americans want a response sooner rather than later. Not to mention, the rest of their crew will be returning after the holiday. Which poses another risk of infection.” He drank again, biting against the burn of the whiskey. “You know they’d go diggin’ if they found out about it. Can’t leave well-enough alone, can they? Just have to have an answer. Have to poke and prod and see it all for themselves.”

I suddenly wished I’d taken the commander’s offer for a drink. Something to help alleviate the tension polluting my body.

“We should tell them our search was interrupted by the storm,” I suggested. “That we can resume in the morning, once the storm has passed. That’ll at least buy us a little time.”

He took another drink and grimaced. “I don’t like it, but it’s the best we can do for now. Radio Command and tell Them exactly that. See if the Americans will grant us an extension. But come tomorrow, they’ll be wantin’ answers. Somethin’ concrete, and if we don’t have it, they’ll send a team in.”

I nodded. “And the entity? What do you propose we do about that, sir?”

“Well, for now it’s buried, but there’s no sayin’ how much good that’ll do us.” He set the bottle on his desk and rubbed at his eyes. “Christ, we’re up against a wall here.” He glanced out the nearest window as curtains of snow came down thick. “Storm’s heavy right now. No goin’ out in that. Tomorrow, we should…”

“Should what, sir?”

He blinked. “How much petrol do we have in storage?”

“Few canisters,” I answered. “Supposed to get more during our next supply shipment.”

“Right. Well, I say we try to burn the damn thing.”

“Are you sure?”

He stared at me with a furrowed brow, bemused. “Growin’ sympathetic, are we? You read that document same as me. This thing, whatever It is, can manipulate our minds. It made someone disappear, made another pop like a balloon.”

“But only after It was provoked.”

“It’s dangerous, Sonya. No two ways about it. You know this, otherwise you wouldn’t have stopped us from diggin’ the damn thing up.”

I flinched against his harsh inflection. “No, I-I know, sir. I just wanted to make sure you were certain because if we go out there tomorrow with intent to kill, and we fail, that’s it for us.”

“And if we sit around waitin’ for someone else to stumble upon It, we might as well consign ourselves to death. Maybe worse. Imagine what someone could do with a critter like that.” He leaned back in his seat and looked up at the ceiling. “When I was in the service, we would sometimes find IEDs just in the streets. We didn’t bury them and hope nothin’ would happen. We’d dispose of them proper. No matter the risks.""

“Sorry, sir. I just wanted to consider all angles before we make any decisions.”

The air between us turned sour. The commander continued drinking from the bottle and chewing on his matchstick. The look in his eyes wishing it was a cigarette instead.

“Tell me somethin’, Sonya,” he said, attempting to help dispel the awkwardness lingering between us. “We’ve been workin’ together almost a year now, yeah?”

“Give or take, sir.”

“Right, give or take.” He chuckled to himself. “What made you come out here?”

I paused a moment, sometimes wondering the very same thing while lying in my bed late at night. “I guess I needed to get away.”

“Away from what?”

“People, society.” My fingers drummed against the arm of my chair. “I spent so much of my life with this plan, you know? Go to school, get good grades, find a stable career, settle down. That sort of thing. But about halfway through university, I realized how much I hated school. My grades, while decent, didn’t really mean anything. And that job was just wishful thinking because no matter where I went or how long I worked there, it never really made me happy.”

A soft smile crossed his lips. “And does this? Does being out here make you happy?”

I shook my head solemnly. “Far as I can tell, nothing does. Not really. I just follow routine; get through the days.”

“Don’t we all?”

“Sometimes, if I’m being honest, I’m not really sure who I am or what I’m doing. I tried to do it their way. Tried the nine-to-five and all that. But I just didn’t fit in with the natural ebb and flow of society. Always felt like I was swimming against the current. So, when I heard about this job, I figured I’d give it a go. See what happened. Maybe a little time away would sort me out.”

His eyebrows raised curiously. “And?”

“And I’m still at square one. Still have no clue. Life just happens, and I’m there to endure it.”

“Maybe that’s why you’re so good at followin’ orders.” He ruminated over this and scoffed. “Could teach the others a thing or two, I imagine.” Then, in a softer tone, he said: “You’re young yet, Sonya. That battle you’re fightin’, we all do it at some point or another. Me against me, you against you. That sort of thing. But how do you fight an enemy you know nothin’ about? Boggles the mind, don’t it?”

If the commander would’ve offered me a drink then, I don’t think I would’ve refused again. But he didn’t. Instead, he kept the bottle to himself, cradled in his lap. He pulled the matchstick from his mouth and tossed it into a nearby trash bin, replacing it with another from the box he kept in his breast pocket.

“Since you’re such a wellspring of wisdom,” I said, “do you have any advice?”

“Yeah,” he said, “don’t sign up for the Army hoping that it’ll solve all your problems.” He laughed to himself and stood from the chair. “It’ll teach you discipline, give you structure. But I’m not gonna promise it’ll make you happy.”

“Thanks…I guess.”

He looked down at me, the usual edge of his gaze dulled by the whiskey. “You want somethin’ honest? Don't let it weigh on you. It's just static. Noise, Sonya. That's all. You've gotta find a way to tune it out. Once you step up and take charge of your life, things will get better. Not easier, it doesn’t ever get easier, but you figure out how to carry that weight instead of struggling beneath it.”

“Thanks,” I said, meaning it this time.

“Alright, radio Command and give them the message for the American company. Tell them what you will to get us more time. For now, this stays between us. The rest are on a need-to-know basis, do you understand?”

“Yes, sir.”

“I want you to monitor the rest of the crew. See if any of them show symptoms of infection. Confusion, disorientation, memory loss, unusual quietness. That last should be rather easy to spot with some of ‘em. Once we’re in the clear, we’ll divulge what we know and head out to take care of this.”

I rose from my seat. “To be safe, we should probably maintain a distance from each other. Prepare our own meals and refrain from sharing drinks.”

“I see where you’re comin’ from, but if we do that, they’ll only get more suspicious. We need to be careful about how we proceed. Last thing we want is to incite panic.”

“Not telling them is going to do just that.”

“But if we tell ‘em, there’s no saying how they might react. One way or the other, it’ll be a long night. Let them remain blissfully ignorant for the time being. That way, they don’t feel pressured to act a certain way. Should make observing them a lot easier.”

While I couldn’t necessarily agree with the commander’s methods, it wasn’t my place to further question him or negate any of his decisions. There was a reason he’d been put in charge, and love it or hate it, I had my orders.

“I trust you can take it from here then?” he asked.

“I’ll do what I can, sir.”

At the same time, I had to wonder how close the commander had gotten to the foreigner. Whether he’d been within its contamination radius. Hell, I had to wonder the same about myself. There was no saying how expansive its reach went. If Emma’s log was any indication, it could instigate hallucinations and delusions from a miles away. Could distort a person’s reality even while buried beneath a thick layer of ice and snow. There just wasn’t enough data present to fully comprehend its abilities. Wasn’t enough to understand the risks or dangers it posed.

I exited the commander’s quarters and walked down the hall to the common room where the others were in the midst of a game of pool. It was Benny against Javier while Arianna fingered through pages of the Bible. I didn't know how much good it would do her, but if it gave her some kind of solace, I wasn't going to interfere. As I entered the room, they stopped what they were doing and looked at me. Their eyes wide, faces absent of emotion. Seconds passed, them staring at me and me staring at them.

I exhaled and said: “Don’t let me stop you. Looks like Benny’s got you against the ropes again.”

Javier snorted. “He wishes.” Then, he sunk one of the striped balls in the corner pocket and celebrated with a beer. “I’m a dead-eye, güey. Never miss a shot.”

“You’ve scratched almost six times now,” Arianna muttered beneath her breath, returning to her scriptures.

“If you can keep that up,” Benny said to Javier, “I might actually have to try for once.”

“I see you sweatin’ over there, Benji,” he replied. “You can’t even keep the cue straight.”

Benny chalked his stick and mumbled beneath his breath: “Keep talkin’, see what happens.”

He lifted his hand to his tousled hair, trying to comb the thick locks out of his eyes to no avail. Benny had what we called, permanent bedhead. His shaggy beard giving him the appearance of a stereotypical lumberjack.

""I'm gonna send you runnin' home to mommy,"" Javier joked.

At this, Benny clenched his jaw. ""Just take your next shot already.""

And like that, they'd forgotten all about me. That was one fire put out, and I had a feeling that the remainder of my night would be spent performing this same conversational maneuver to make sure no others would spring up. Affecting a level of nonchalance to keep everyone else pacified and unsuspecting. At least, until the commander deemed it safe enough to tell them.

A few seconds later, Ludwig came out from the kitchen with a bowl of dip and a couple bags of chips. There was talk about getting dinner ready soon, but this small treat was meant to tide us over until then. Again, I abstained.

He set the bowl on the table and opened the chips. The others broke from their game and joined him. I watched silently as they passed the chips around, all digging into the dip without pause. Then, Benny started pouring shots for everyone as a means of passing the time. Like I said, you had to make your own entertainment.

""Sonya?"" he asked.

""I'm good,"" I said, stifling the scream lodged in my throat.

I slipped past them and headed down the opposite hall into the radio room. I contacted our superiors and told them we would need more time to investigate since we were interrupted by the storm. They told me they would pass the message to the American company and respond later with any further updates or instructions. I thought about telling them the truth, about asking for reinforcements, but it dawned on me that the more people we involved, the chance of infection only increased. We had to isolate, at least until we knew more.

After that, I went into my room and placed Emma’s hard drive in the top shelf of my dresser. I don’t know why, but I liked the idea of having it close. As if it meant something for me to have it. As if it somehow gave me importance.

For the rest of the night, the others alternated between board games and rounds of pool. They drank and chatted, laughed on occasion. Supper never came. Instead, they snacked on chips and other prepackaged foods which was preferable in given circumstances.

To them, it was just any other weekend. A grace period between holidays where the expectation for work was relatively low. Not that we were able to accomplish much without the other half of our team.

At some point, Ludwig turned to me and asked: “What was the deal earlier? With that stuff at the American base?”

I searched for a plausible answer, glad Arianna hadn’t told them about the possibility of contamination. Maybe it had slipped her mind, or maybe she didn’t want to be the brunt for their questions. Either way, it made easier for me to fabricate a story from scratch than try to mold one from any details she might've given them.

“I, uh, found some entry logs from one of the cabins,” I explained, trying to conceive something plausible. “They noted a possible biohazard in the area.”

“What kind of biohazard?”

“They didn’t specify, but I thought it might pose a danger if we stuck around. Probably better to just leave it alone. Let the American company deal with it instead.”

“Was it flammable or something?” Javier asked, leaning across the pool table to take his next shot. “Because we found some human remains. Looked like they’d been burnt.”

“No, I don’t believe so. From what I could gather, the analysts were trying to secure the area, and they encountered issues along the way.”

“Issues? That guy was charred to a crisp.”

Before I could answer, Ludwig interjected with: “Wait a minute, what kind of biohazard are we talking about?”

“I’m not sure exactly,” I confessed. “The records were vague. I think the analysts were still in the process of collecting samples and testing.”

“Was it some kind of fungus?” Javier asked. “Do you think we’ll be okay? I mean, we were all in the vicinity of it, right?”

“It’s unclear,” I said. “I talked it over with the commander. He’s still trying to figure out our next steps. But I’m sure once he has an answer, he’ll share it with the rest of us.”

Benny set his pool cue down on the table. “Should I take a shower?”

“You shower?” Javier remarked. “Since when?”

“Calm down,” I cut in before the situation could spiral any further. “It was probably nothing. I overreacted earlier because I was afraid…uh…that we’d get in some kind of trouble for interfering with the American’s research. The bureaucrats get really worked up about stuff like this, especially when it comes to new discoveries.”

“Still,” said Ludwig, “we should have done more to preserve the scene. We left a body out there in the storm.”

“I know, and I apologize. I wasn’t thinking straight. I jumped the gun, and the commander already gave me a stern talking to. We’ll probably head out again tomorrow to clean up the mess and further assess the situation.”

I was met by a sea of dubious stares. If I were them, I wouldn’t believe me either. Not completely. But I was just the mouthpiece. If they wanted answers, they’d have to take their concerns to the commander, and he wasn’t always the most approachable person.

“Well, I have some tissue samples from the corpse,” Ludwig said. “I can perform a few tests and see what comes back.”

“I would wait and see what the commander wants us to do.”

“You know he’s our superior,” Javier said, “not God, right?”

I suppressed my irritation. “I know. I’m just trying to be professional about this.”

Ludwig narrowed his eyes, a groove forming across his forehead. “What are you not telling us?”

“I’m telling you everything I know.”

“I think you are full of shit. I can see it in your eyes. You are acting strange tonight.”

“You’re more than welcome to ask the commander yourself.”

“What is the point? He won’t tell us anything. You have always been his favorite. His proud little puppy dog.”

My cheeks flushed, and I could feel the heat radiating from my face. “Maybe I’m just better at following orders.”

“Better at not asking questions maybe,” Javier offered in a casual manner.

“Hey, let’s all take a second to breathe,” Benny suggested. “If there was a problem, the commander would tell us himself. Plus, we were all wearing insulated gear.”

“That does not help us against airborne pathogens,” Ludwig countered. “If there was a biohazard, we would most likely have been exposed.”

“We were wearing face masks though.”

“Balaclavas are not medical-grade. They’re meant to protect you against the cold, not viruses.”

Benny, teetering between buzzed and intoxicated, raised his hands in surrender and mumbled a fake apology. Then, he tapped the table with his hand to get Javier’s attention. “You gonna take your turn or what?”

Tentatively, Javier angled the stick and rammed the cue ball. There was a loud crack as the other balls bounced against each other, rebounding off the inner lip of the table. They came to a gradual standstill, the room falling silent in response.

Ludwig looked me up and down. “We’re infected with something, aren’t we?”

“No,” I lied. “I don’t think so.”

“What is it?”

“I don’t know.”

“Bullshit. You think I haven't noticed the way you have been watching us. What did the commander put you up to?”

“Nothing.”

“Don’t lie to me, Sonya!” His expression was taut and cold as steel. “What aren’t you telling us?” A moment of silence passed as I wracked my brain for a response. He stepped forward: “What is going on!”

I reached for the rifle that wasn’t there. The one that I had locked up in the armory with the rest of the firearms. It was an instinctual reaction, one I’d grown quite accustomed to during those excursions with my brother, where a snap of twigs from the forest could mean anything. Could be a bird taking to the sky, a rabbit running across the ground, or a grizzly bear about to invade our camp.

And while I tried to play it off as if I was just stretching, Ludwig took notice. His face hardened. Behind him, Benny and Javier set their pool cues on the table and took a step back. Arianna quietly closed her book and placed it on the coffee table. She hunkered lower into her seat as if to take cover.

Then, Ludwig barrelled past, shouldering me aside as he darted down the northern hallway. Once I had regained my balance, I gave chase, catching up quickly and crashing into his side. He bounced off the wall and fell to the floor. Before I could further pursue, Javier was behind me, maneuvering his arms under mine, attempting to put me into a Full Nelson. I swung my head back against his face. There was an audible crunch of his nose, and he yelled out in pain. His arms went slack around me, and I slipped free.

By then, Ludwig had returned to his feet, stumbling down the hall towards the armory. I leapt onto his back, wrapping my legs about his waist and trying to secure my arms around his throat.

We teetered from side-to-side, falling against the wall before collapsing to the ground. My head slammed against the floorboards, and my vision rippled like a stone on water.

There was yelling and screaming, but I couldn’t tell who or where it was coming from. Maybe it was just my imagination. I don’t know. Before I could try to figure it out, I was already crawling across the floor after Ludwig. Just as I extended my hand to grab him, Javier  had me by the ankle and started dragging me away. I began to flail and kick in response, my defense mechanisms not so different from those of a child in the midst of a tantrum.

Benny came in to break us up, grabbing Javier by the collar of his shirt and pulling him off me. They wrestled against each other, awkwardly skittering around the hallway as neither could outright overpower the other despite Benny’s larger frame. It seemed all that booze had dulled his senses.

I turned away from them, watching Ludwig scramble to his feet again. His left foot dragged, injured from the previous skirmish.

Climbing to my hands and knees, I pounced at him, hooking my arms around his legs. Thrown off balance, he dropped on top of me. My teeth came together hard, clamping down against the inside of my cheek. The distinct metallic tinge of blood washed over my tongue.

“What are you hiding?” Ludwig yelled, trying to push me away. “What aren’t you telling us?”

“I already told you everything I know!” I returned, a horrible lie said with more conviction than I felt.

“Bullshit!”

There was a sharp click, and everything came to a standstill. Slowly, I raised my head, staring down the barrel of the commander’s revolver. It drifted towards Ludwig, then rose to face Benny before settling its sights on Javier.

“Somethin’ we need to discuss?” the commander asked, gesturing with his gun for us to stand up.

Ludwig shoved me away and returned to his feet. I wiped the blood from my lips, and with Benny’s help, stood. Glancing over my shoulder, I saw Javier sporting a fresh bruise on his cheek, and he refused to meet my gaze.

“Who would like to go first?” Commander Kimball asked.

Ludwig wasted no time at all. “What the hell is going on?”

The commander frowned. “I need you to lower your voice and be a little more specific.”

Ludwig was successful in only one of these demands. “Sir, what did we find out there?”

Even as I stared at the floor, I could feel the weight of the commander’s eyes on me. I had failed to uphold my orders. Whether this was a subconscious blunder or a furtively intentional one remained a mystery to me. Either way, I won't lie and say I didn't experience some modicum of relief at no longer having to keep it a secret.

“You wanna know?” the commander asked. “You really wanna know? Alright, fine. Sonya discovered a document in one of the American’s cabins, Emma of Outpost Delta. This document detailed an unusual finding…a foreign entity.”

“Foreign entity?” Javier remarked. “Like an alien.”

The commander grinned. “Somethin’ like that, yeah.”

“Bullshit,” came Ludwig. I think that might’ve been a recent addition to his vocabulary, or maybe it was a new catchphrase. “What was it really?”

The commander shrugged. “As far as we know, it’s exactly that. This thing, whatever It is, has the ability to infect others, to manipulate their memories, incite hallucinations, and distort their thoughts. There isn’t much else we know about It, honestly. The encounter, while disturbing, was brief. Provoking more questions than supplying answers.”

He continued to tell them about everything we had read. How one of the analysts, Edvard, wandered outside his cabin under the belief that there was someone else stranded in a snowstorm. How he happened upon the entity and was saved by his fellow employee, Emma. They proceeded to have a conversation that the commander suspected was the entity trying to ascertain the nature of humanity. The motivation behind this was still vague, but the commander believed the entity was attempting to assimilate. That it either was hoping to mimic our behaviors, or at the very least, gather an understanding of our species.

He noted that Its approach focused more on emotions and thought patterns as opposed to defense mechanisms and warfare procedures. It showed little to no interest in our technological advancements. Which, in the commander’s mind, meant the entity was either extremely naive in nature or completely unconcerned with humanity’s abilities to repel Its presence.

Then, he told them how Edvard, infected by the entity, went back to the outskirts to dig the creature up. That he tried to free It from the ice but was stopped by Emma. This resulted in the deaths of the American skeleton crew aside from Emma, who took her own life after believing she too had fallen victim to the entity’s influence. A last ditch effort to contain It.

“We don’t know where It came from,” the commander said, “we don’t know why It’s here, and we don’t know what It planned to do if It successfully broke out of the ice. What we do know is that It’s dangerous, has parasitic tendencies, and will stop at nothing to gain Its freedom. While It behaves in a relatively peaceful manner at first, if It at all feels provoked or in danger, It becomes hostile in ways you cannot begin to imagine.”

Benny scoffed. “You’re fucking serious, aren’t you?”

“Afraid so,” the commander replied. “We didn’t tell you because—”

“Because you think one of us might have been infected,” Ludwig finished.

Begrudgingly, he nodded. “Maybe more than one.”

“Did you tell the American company about this?” Javier asked. “I mean, shouldn’t they know? It’s technically their problem, right?”

“It was Their problem, yes,” the commander agreed. “But now, this issue has fallen into our laps.” He lowered his revolver, holstering it. “I had Sonya radio Command, requesting we be given more time to investigate the American camp. Chances are slim that They’ll grant us any extra time. So, tomorrow morning, we’ll ride back out there and try to destroy the entity before the Americans can send a rescue team.”

“Destroy It?” Benny asked. “How the hell are we supposed to do that?”

“You’re the demolition expert.”

“I mean, I could rig up a couple of homemade fire bombs or something, but we’d need to put in a request for dynamite or thermal charges. Not that Command would just give us any.”

Ludwig exhaled laboriously, his hands smothering his face in frustration. “You should have told us. I collected tissue samples from the infected employee. Am I infected now?”

The commander was calm when he said: “It’s a distinct possibility. Any of us could be infected. Maybe all of us.”

“Well, how do we know? What are the symptoms?”

“Confusion, memory loss, disorientation, perhaps fatigue. When Edvard was infected, he showed an ignorance to weather and temperature as well as an enhanced immune system. There was also a sense of detachment from his emotions and memories. Emma experienced a similar phenomenon near the end. There was an emphasis on her failing cognition. That she was losing track of time, and she could feel the entity manipulating her thoughts.”

Benny lifted his head and looked around. “Does anyone feel that now?”

The commander laughed. “I appreciate the effort, Ben, but the entity exhibits cautious behavior about outing itself. Whether Edvard knew he was infected or not is ambiguous, and if he did know, he made no mention of it to Emma.”

“You are forgetting something, Commander,” Ludwig said. “Those aren’t exactly uncommon symptoms. Cold temperatures, lack of daylight, isolation from humanity. It is only natural that we might develop mental fatigue or depression or lack of concentration in our given environment.”

I couldn’t speak. I didn’t know what to do, or if there even was anything I could do to help. The situation felt helpless. We were just waiting to see what would happen. Hoping for the best, but ultimately, preparing for the worst. And as this sense of dread unfolded between us, we all looked around at one another, realizing just how dire our situation actually was.

“What about the biological process?” Ludwig asked optimistically. “When the host is infected, is the entity taking control of the mind, or is it inserting its own cells—”

The commander held up a hand to silence him. “We don’t know. When the others confronted Edvard, his body began to transform. But it’s not clear whether those were his own cells or the entity’s. Maybe it was a mixture of both. By the time the American’s employees discovered the entity, it was too late. They didn’t have a chance to perform tests or draw any conclusions. They were already dead.”

“Shouldn’t we do something?” Javier asked. “I mean, that thing is out there.”

“We can’t go out in a storm like this,” I said. “Right now, as far as we know, It’s still buried beneath a thick layer of ice and snow. The storm will be gone by tomorrow morning. That’ll be the first chance we have to take action.”

“Fuck the storm! I say we go out there now and kill it. Actually, screw that. Why don’t we just radio the American company and tell them to deal with it. Call Command and get us a ride out of here.”

“That is not a bad idea,” Ludwig commented. “If it was the American’s employees that first discovered this entity, then it should be their responsibility to handle It. No?”

I glanced at the commander, recognizing the exhaustion on his face. The slight hum of intoxication in his eyes. He seemed more inclined to fall asleep than to answer any more questions.

“We didn’t plan on telling the American company,” I admitted. “And for the time being, we weren’t going to tell Command either. It’s too dangerous for anyone else to get involved. We need to contain the entity’s reach. Try to keep the situation isolated from the rest of society.”

Ludwig threw up his hands. “This is bullshit!”

“Quite,” the commander replied. “But I’m open to suggestions.”

At that, the room was silent again. We looked around at each other, uncertain and afraid. We were expecting to encounter difficulties out here, but this wasn’t something anyone could prepare us for.

“It’s late,” the commander finally said. “Why don’t we call it a night? Return to our quarters, try to get some sleep, and finish this in the morning.”

“How the hell are we supposed to sleep after this?” Javier asked.

“With your doors locked,” I suggested.

The commander nodded agreeingly. Then, he went to the end of the hall and removed the armory key from the hook on the wall. “I’ll keep this with me. If anyone has a problem with that, let me know.” His hand came down to rest on the grip of his revolver. “I’m sure we can figure somethin’ out.”

“Once this is done with,” Ludwig said, “I’m outta here. I’ll make sure Command hears about this.”

“That’s just fine by me, but nobody leaves until we’re finished here.”

After that, we retreated to our rooms. No one bothered cleaning up the lounge, it seemed pointless to do so. Not to mention we had all become conscious of each other, the gaps between us steadily growing.

Ahead of me, I watched Javier and Ludwig whispering amongst themselves. I tried to hear what they were saying, but I couldn’t make out their voices over the sound of shuffling feet and creaking floorboards. So, instead, I looked over at Benny to see if he had anything to say, but he ignored me. Arianna was quiet too. She retrieved her Bible from the coffee table and stared at her feet as she walked past me.

“You okay?” I asked her.

She shrugged. “Are any of us?”

Then, she slipped inside her room and closed the door behind her. The others did the same. I watched as their doors slammed shut, listened as the locks clicked into place.

1iprsf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TLRY/comments/1iprsf8/fawn_weaver_stop_saying_the_spirits_industry_is/,Fawn Weaver: ‘Stop saying the spirits industry is in decline – it’s not’,"13 February 2025

Is the spirits industry in trouble? Or is the trade simply in a state of recalibration following the Covid-19 pandemic? Fawn Weaver, founder of Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey, shares her thoughts.

Recent headlines claim the spirits industry is in trouble, citing declining consumption due to the rise of non-alcoholic beverages, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, increased marijuana use, and shifting generational preferences. But until now, no one has compiled the full picture in one place. When you analyse all the data together, a different story emerges – one that challenges these prevailing narratives.

Temporary market corrections are not signs of permanent decline. Data shows premiumisation is driving strong consumer spending in spirits. This is not a collapse – it’s a return to normalcy.

**A historical parallel: post-pandemic corrections**

The 1918 Spanish ﬂu pandemic led to a temporary pullback in drinking at bars and restaurants. Once the world reopened, alcohol sales spiked, then stabilised. A century later, history is repeating itself. Covid-19 created an artiﬁcial surge in alcohol sales as consumers stocked home bars and replaced nights out with at-home cocktails. That surge was never sustainable, and the industry is now adjusting back to pre-pandemic norms. Much like today, early predictions of long-term decline were misguided. The market is correcting, not collapsing.

**Consumers are drinking less, but spending remains strong**

It is true that consumers are drinking less than they did at the peak of the pandemic, but that does not mean the industry is shrinking. During Covid-19, at-home drinking skyrocketed. However, as offices reopened and business travel resumed, this habit declined.

From 2013 to 2018, spirits sales grew at an average annual rate of 4.3% before accelerating to 5.34% in 2019 and spiking to 10% in 2021 and 12.23% in 2022. According to NIQ, US retail alcohol sales – including beer, wine, and spirits – peaked at US$113.6 billion in 2023 before settling at US$112.9bn in 2024, a modest 0.8% decline. This adjustment was expected, yet some industry analysts are reacting as if it signals a crisis.

The Distilled Spirits Council of the US (Discus) [recently released its annual report](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2025/02/tequila-and-rtds-keep-us-spirits-industry-afloat/), showing a 1.1% decline in US supplier gross revenue across spirits, beer, and wine – a correction milder than historical patterns would predict. However, if the spirits industry had continued its pre-Covid growth trajectory, averaging 5% annual growth, its 2024 revenue levels would not have been reached until 2025.

At the same time, spirits market volumes rose in 2024, increasing 1.1% to 312.2 million nine-litre cases. This further contradicts the notion that consumers are drinking less. The strong growth of ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages played a key role in shifting revenue, as their lower price points slightly reduced overall sales figures. However, the data makes one thing clear: America is still drinking.

The spirits market isn’t shrinking; it’s stabilising.

**Premiumisation: consumers are trading up, not out**

In addition to the strong growth of RTDs, a major trend that is often overlooked is premiumisation – the shift towards higher-quality alcohol. Some consumers are choosing easier with RTDs, while others are choosing better with premium spirits.

Recent NielsenIQ data confirms that while total alcohol sales have adjusted downwards, spending on premium and ultra-premium spirits continues to rise. In the most recent Nielsen report, [Uncle Nearest](http://unclenearest.com/) grew 22.3%, while other top Bourbons – including Blanton’s, Angel’s Envy, and Colonel E.H. Taylor – saw gains between 20% and 55%. High-end Tequilas like Lalo, Tequila Ocho, and La Gritona surged between 23% and 124%.

Each of these Bourbon and Tequila brands has sustained double-digit growth over the past 26 weeks, reinforcing that this is not a temporary trend but a long-term consumer shift towards higher-quality spirits. Consumers are making more intentional choices, favouring well-crafted, 100% additive-free spirits. Pure and authentic Bourbons stand apart as all-natural spirits – naturally sugar-free, carb-free, fat-free, and gluten-free – appealing to health-conscious consumers seeking superior choices without compromise.

**The non-alcoholic trend is overstated**

Yes, the non-alcoholic category is growing, but its impact remains small, and growth is already slowing.

The US non-alcoholic market reached US$823m in 2024 and is projected to grow to nearly US$5bn by 2028, according to IWSR. However, growth is already decelerating. The non-alcoholic category grew by 35% in 2023, 26% in the past year, and 20.6% in 2022, yet its projected CAGR from 2024-2028 is just 18%. If this were a true industry disruptor, we’d expect growth acceleration – not a slowdown.

Even recent reports showing strong single-year growth don’t change the reality that momentum is fading. While some analysts claim non-alcoholic alternatives are reshaping the industry, the data tells a different story: this remains a niche category, not a widespread shift away from alcohol.

The overwhelming majority of this growth comes from non-alcoholic beer, which accounts for 84% of total non-alcoholic sales. Since beer already has a naturally low ABV of 4%-6%, removing alcohol while maintaining taste was relatively easy – leading to broader consumer adoption.

Meanwhile, non-alcoholic ‘spirits’ barely exceed 1% of total no-alcohol sales. Unlike beer, replicating the complex taste and mouthfeel of Bourbon, Tequila, or vodka without alcohol has proven challenging. To compensate, many non-alcoholic ‘spirits’ rely on artiﬁcial additives, excessive sugar, or other compounds, contradicting the very health-conscious appeal that initially attracted many consumers.

If non-alcoholic spirits were truly disrupting the industry, they’d be more than just a rounding error. At barely 1% of the non-alcoholic category – excluding beer and wine – let’s just say no one should be holding their breath for a non-alcoholic Bourbon or Tequila boom, at least not in this lifetime.

**Election years and consumer behaviour**

Political uncertainty has historically impacted consumer spending, including alcohol. Following the 2016 election, the industry saw a temporary slowdown, with growth declining from 3.38% in 2016 to 2.04% in 2017 (Discus) – a 1.47 percentage point drop. While the reasons for this are not entirely clear, post-election uncertainty or the emotional responses of voters may have contributed.

We are witnessing a similar pattern now. While some analysts attribute industry softness to broader economic shifts, historical data suggests political transitions can have short-term effects on discretionary spending, including alcohol. If history is any guide, this too will pass.

**GLP-1 drugs: a variable, not a verdict**

According to a May 2024 KFF Health Tracking Poll, 12% of adults have used GLP-1 drugs, including 6% who are currently taking them – and it is unclear how many of them were regular alcohol consumers before starting the drug. A study by Blue Health Intelligence found that over 30% of patients discontinued these medications within the ﬁrst four weeks, despite recommendations to continue treatment for at least 12 weeks.

Given this high rate of early discontinuation, the long-term impact of GLP-1 medications on alcohol consumption remains uncertain. Past health-driven trends like the Atkins diet and clean-eating movement did not lead to a lasting decline in alcohol consumption. There is no reason to believe this time will be any different.

**Cannabis and alcohol: not a one-for-one trade off**

Some suggest that increased cannabis use is replacing alcohol, but studies do not support this claim. A 2022 review published in the National Library of Medicine – *Patterns of cannabis and alcohol co-use: Substitution versus complementary effects –* analysed 95 studies, and found both substitution and complementary effects between cannabis and alcohol, meaning some individuals use cannabis instead of alcohol, while others consume both together.

If marijuana were truly replacing alcohol at scale, we would expect to see dramatic declines in alcohol sales in states where cannabis has been legal the longest. While some substitution effects have impacted beer sales, overall alcohol sales have not declined more in legalised states than in those without legalisation.

**Gen Z is not rejecting alcohol for health reasons**

Gen Z is drinking less than previous generations did at their age, but their preferences indicate a shift towards quality over quantity. The decline in consumption appears to be driven more by premiumisation than by health-consciousness, as their engagement with other substances – such as vaping – suggests a more complex shift in behaviour rather than outright rejection of alcohol.

Gen Z is vaping at unprecedented rates, consuming nicotine in ways previous generations abandoned. Unlike the cigarettes their parents and grandparents smoked, modern e-cigarettes and vapes often contain signiﬁcantly higher levels of nicotine, making them even more addictive.

This suggests that their drinking habits will evolve, not disappear. Millennials initially moved away from beer before later embracing premium spirits and craft cocktails. The alcohol industry has always adapted to generational shifts, and it will do so again.

**Regulatory pressures are nothing new**

Some have suggested that potential cancer warning labels on alcohol pose an existential threat to the industry. However, history tells a different story. Similar warnings were once issued for red meat, coffee, and artiﬁcial sweeteners – only for those claims to be revised or retracted as new research emerged.

In December 2024, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released their Scientiﬁc Report, notably declining to issue new recommendations on alcohol consumption. The agencies concluded that more comprehensive reviews were needed before considering any changes, meaning the existing federal guidelines – up to two drinks per day for men and one for women – remain unchanged. This decision reinforces the reality that even within regulatory agencies, the current data does not justify a drastic shift in alcohol consumption guidance.

Even if labelling changes are proposed, implementation would take years. [The surgeon general’s recent advisory on alcohol](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2025/01/surgeon-general-calls-for-cancer-warning-on-alcohol-labels/) and cancer risk represents a shifting narrative rather than settled science.

Meanwhile, obesity remains one of the leading risk factors for cancer, yet sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) – a primary contributor to obesity – face no equivalent push for cancer warning labels. A major study published in *The BMJ* found a clear link between higher consumption of sugary drinks and an increased risk of overall cancer and breast cancer. Despite this, public health officials have not proposed mandatory warning labels for sodas, even though they directly contribute to obesity-related diseases – which is demonstrably a far greater cancer risk.

If public health is truly the priority, risk messaging should be consistent across all dietary contributors to cancer, not selectively targeted at alcohol. The alcohol industry has long promoted responsible drinking, and existing federal guidelines emphasise moderation, not abstinence.

**A market reset is already under way – and that’s a good thing**

Inventory levels at distributor warehouses are elevated, reflecting a natural adjustment after the pandemic-induced surge. Before distributors resume normal purchasing patterns, they must work through excess stock – but this is a short-term reset, not a long-term decline.

The biggest mistake industry observers and investors are making is assuming that this correction signals a permanent decline. If analysts had abandoned alcohol after the Spanish flu, they would have missed the Roaring ’20s. If they had written it off during Prohibition, they would have failed to anticipate its resurgence the moment the ban was lifted. If they had panicked during the low-carb craze, they would have ignored the explosion of craft cocktails and premium spirits. Every major shift in consumer behaviour has led to predictions of the industry’s demise – yet the industry has always rebounded, stronger than before.

This time is no different. The real mistake isn’t in the market’s adjustment – it’s in failing to recognise it for what it is: temporary and necessary.

1iprp37,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1iprp37/trip_report_janfeb_2025_vieques_fajardoluquillo/,"Trip Report Jan/Feb 2025 - Vieques, Fajardo/Luquillo, Ponce","I was in Puerto Rico from January 27 to February 6 with my husband. We are in our 30s and enjoy doing active, outdoorsy things. We went to Vieques, Fajardo/Luquillo, and Ponce. Here are my recommendations and tips:

**Vieques - What To Do**

* **Mosquito Pier** - Great snorkeling. There is a ladder into the water near a tree on the left as you drive in. The underwater supports are spooky and I didn't want to spend too much time under the pier as the water was a bit rough, but I still saw tons of cool stuff, including a turtle. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pCN29Mw890) shows what it's like; if you find the video itself too unsettling I'd avoid it. You can still see lots of cool fish if you swim around the pier and don't go under it, though my husband is a confident swimmer and dove downwards and apparently saw even more good stuff.
* **Playa Punta Arenas** - We went here two days in a row; day one was insanely good and day two was just okay. Husband saw a spotted eagle ray, and I saw a nurse shark (!!!), a turtle, a huge pufferfish, and a small barracuda. Of course there were tons of other fish, sea urchins, etc. as well. The expanse of shallow, calm water and ease of entry makes this a good option to take kids snorkeling though it gets pretty deep farther out. The sand fleas on the shore were pretty bad even at like 1 pm but we came here to snorkel so we dealt with it. The road to the beach was manageable with a golf cart if you are a confident/experienced driver, but otherwise take a rental car as there are a ridiculous number of potholes. I saw people say you absolutely need a Jeep, which if you are a good driver is not true. Just be careful. [I made this graphic](https://i.imgur.com/2EgRVm9.png) to show where to go. NOTE: There is a strong northward current so I recommend starting at the bottom and letting it take you up, then head towards the beach and walk back south (or swim closer to shore).
* **Playa La Chiva** - This beach is part of the NWR and the road is also incredibly full of potholes, so same note as above applies. We swam out to the west side of the bigger cay which I'd heard was good; we saw some stuff but it wasn't really worth it at the time and it got way too rough the farther out we got. I did see a 1 meter long sea cucumber and a couple of big starfish, though. The water is shallow even very far out so it's pleasant to hang out and swim in. We stopped at parking spot #8 or so. I have heard the end towards Punta Conejo is good for snorkeling—maybe next time.
* **Cayo de Tierra** - This was a very cool little hike; you walk across a land bridge to the cay, then enter the forest and take a trail that leads to a cliff where you can sit and overlook the bay (we even saw a stingray way down in the water). The cliff and hike are not recommended for younger kids as the cliff itself is smallish and would be only too easy to fall off of. There was a brief steep portion but I didn't think the hike was that bad. The trail is not clearly marked and parts are a bit overgrown. However, I think it'd be hard to actually get lost because it's a small area. [I found this map](https://i.imgur.com/zfqtyBD.jpeg) really helpful; the little spur at the bottom to the east is where the cliff was. Maybe it'd be a good sunrise hike!
* **Bio Bay Tour** - I'd never done this so it was a must do, of course. We went the day after the new moon and the stars mirrored the dinoflagellates in the bay. I had a great time and it's obviously a very unique experience, though my husband got to do the tour back when they'd let you swim in the bay so he wasn't as impressed lol. The clear kayaks were awesome and the little guys were like stars, not quite the blue glow they show up as in photos.

**Vieques - Food**

* **Pescadería Angelyz** - Fish market with friendly folks (and tarpon who hang around in the water for scraps) where we got a fresh 2 lb red snapper for $9. Highly recommend coming here if you plan to cook during your stay.
* **Supermercado Morales** - After some trial and error we figured out that this place had superior products and prices (though next time we will do our groceries before hopping on the ferry).
* **Casa Nativo** - Delicious Puerto Rican dishes. We ordered a bunch of appetizers as tapas and enjoyed it immensely. 
* **Smashburger** - My husband was delighted with his chicken sandwich from here!
* **Rising Roost** - Very good food after a bit of a wait, but I think they were understaffed because service was very slow (not the waiters' fault). I would still definitely recommend them but maybe not if you have somewhere to be soon after.

**Vieques - Transportation**

Ceiba ferry - Our ride to Vieques was delayed but you can't beat the price. We parked our rental car for several days in the lot and there was a free shuttle to/from the lot and the ferry. The sign said you could get do monthly parking for $50 (one day was $15) but I think maybe you have to ask for that (?) because we didn't get it automatically applied and ended up paying $75. Slightly disappointing but oh well.

We got a golf cart to go around the island but we would not do it again. We felt safe going around in a golf cart on Culebra but Vieques has bigger/faster roads and even though we are experienced drivers we didn't feel good about driving the golf cart at night (it didn't help that the thing was a piece of crap lol). We ended up taking taxis at night and to/from the golf cart rental place so in the end, we actually would have saved money if we'd just rented a car instead of a golf cart.

The taxi situation can be pretty infuriating and I would NOT recommend it unless you truly cannot drive and don't have any appointments. We found a good taxi company but at peak time (Thursday night) they told us they could not get us a ride. I was terrified that we'd miss our bio bay tour even though I started looking for a taxi 45 minutes ahead of time. We asked around and got the numbers of random ""taxi drivers"". One of them came through for us, but when we asked him to take us back after the tour, he said he was coming and then proceeded to no show. We waited an hour for him because we didn't want to screw him if he'd already left his house, but he screwed us. We eventually used the 741 taxi app to find someone else and got home 2 hours later. The price to go from Esperanza to Isabel (a 15 minute drive) at night was $38 on this app. 😑

Bottom line: just rent a car. Even if someone says they can recommend some guys, I really don't want to deal with calling random dudes who may or may not show up. The 741 app works well but doesn't have enough drivers.

**Fajardo - What To Do**

* **Seven Seas Beach** - This is a perfectly nice beach, though it was a little cold (maybe because it's on the Atlantic side?) I didn't try snorkeling, but there was a peaceful and pretty nature trail where I saw a hermit crab the size of a grapefruit. The main gate might be closed but if you walk along the beach you can get onto the road where you will eventually see a trailhead. The Costa Mía Restaurant was reasonably priced and had tasty snacks and drinks.
* **El Yunque** - Always solid. We parked our car at spots that looked interesting and wandered around. We'd already done the Mt Britton trail on a previous trip so we took it easy and just enjoyed spending time in the rainforest. Right now you do not need to get a ticket ahead of time.
* **[River Cave Swimming Adventure](https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g2665727-d32764385-River_Cave_Swimming_Adventure_at_Vega_Baja_Puerto_Rico-Isla_Verde_Carolina_Puerto.html)** - Not in Fajardo, but it's what we did on one day. We had a wonderful time with Elliott and Cathy. They picked us up at our Airbnb in a rural location (which I was not expecting, very good service!) and took us to a series of caves they'd scoped out where you could swim. They are extremely knowledgeable about the area and very kind; if you have little kids or group members who aren't strong swimmers I would still feel confident going with them. We'd always wanted to explore caves in PR but it's the kind of thing where it's better to go with someone not only for safety but because they know where exactly to go. If you've ever wanted to do this activity, I'd recommend them!

**Ponce - Food**

* **Cafe Lucero** - Seriously delicious coffee (they have their own coffee farm and roaster) and a good menu. Definitely recommend stopping here for a meal. If you're interested in women's clothing there's a nice little shop, Palu Boutique, around the corner.
* **El Negocio de Panchi** - This is straight up a super high end fine dining experience for a fraction of the price in a cozy little restaurant. Insanely good food, great service, and Mr Panchi himself came and chatted with us. It wasn't crowded when we went but we made a reservation just to be safe.

NOTE: Please use Waze in Puerto Rico. Google Maps is flawed and does not reliably factor in traffic. It told us it would take an hour less from Ponce to San Juan than it really did, and if we hadn't checked Waze we might have missed our flight.

WHAT I ATE - Virginia  
@ World of Waffles  
Woodbridge, VA

Just having a late morning breakfast.  My wife ordered the Chicken and Waffles which are terrific here!  Remember to order the Fried Chicken and NOT the Chicken Tenders!  I think the chicken on the bone is more flavorful and you get both white and dark meat.  But if you don't mind boneless chicken breast, that's OK too.

I ordered the Fried Pork Chops with Eggs and Potatoes, which were good.  But after trying a piece of the chicken, I knew what I would order here next!

Of course the waffles are what you come here for.  Big, crispy, buttery, eggy and tender on the inside.  Get them wth pecans or topped with strawberries.  Yum!

If you're here on the weekend before church lets out, seating is very quick.  The staff are mindful and frequently check on you to refill coffee and see how everything is going.

Would love to come by here for dinner after work, BUT THEY ARE NOT OPEN FOR DINNER.  As they close at 3PM.  So, keep in mind, this is a breakfast and lunch place.

Close to DC, there is lots of parking in the back and they are easy to get to, off the I-95 corridor.

Removing Wine Stains from Upholstery: Immediate Steps to Take
-------------------------------------------------------------

When you spill wine on your upholstery, quick action can make all the difference in saving your furniture. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you remove wine stains effectively and efficiently.

### Immediate Action

As soon as the spill happens, grab some clean, dry paper towels. **Gently blot the stain** to absorb as much wine as possible. Avoid rubbing the stain, as this can spread the wine deeper into the fabric. Blotting is key to lifting the wine without pushing it further into the upholstery.

### Prepare Your Cleaning Solution

While blotting, prepare a cleaning solution. Mix one tablespoon of dish soap with two cups of warm water. You can also add a tablespoon of white vinegar to enhance the cleaning power. Vinegar helps neutralize the acid in the wine, making it easier to remove the stain. Stir the mixture gently until the soap dissolves.

### Cleaning the Stain

Once you have your cleaning solution ready, dip a clean cloth into the mixture. Gently wring out the excess liquid so the cloth is damp, not soaking wet. Place the damp cloth over the stain and press down lightly to allow the cleaning solution to penetrate the fabric. Let it sit for a few minutes, then lift the cloth to see if the stain has lifted.

### Rinsing the Area

If the stain is still visible, rinse the area with a clean, damp cloth using only water. This step is crucial to remove any residue from the cleaning solution. Be careful not to oversaturate the upholstery; aim for a gentle, even dampness across the affected area.

### Drying the Upholstery

After rinsing, use clean, dry paper towels to blot the area again. Press down firmly to absorb as much moisture as possible. If the upholstery is thick or padded, you may want to place a heavy book or another flat weight on top to help absorb excess water. Allow the upholstery to air dry completely. Open windows or use a fan to speed up the drying process, but avoid direct sunlight, which can cause the fabric to fade.

### Using Baking Soda (Optional)

If the stain persists after drying, sprinkle baking soda over the affected area. Baking soda acts as a natural deodorizer and can help draw out stubborn stains. Let it sit for a few hours or overnight. Once the baking soda has absorbed the remaining odor and residue, vacuum it up thoroughly.

### Professional Help

In cases where the stain is particularly stubborn or the upholstery is delicate, consider seeking professional help. Professional cleaners have specialized equipment and solutions that can tackle tough stains without damaging the fabric. It’s worth the investment to preserve the beauty and longevity of your furniture.

### Preventive Measures

To prevent future spills from becoming permanent stains, keep a stain remover kit handy. These kits often contain pre-treatment solutions specifically designed for fabrics. Always test any cleaning product on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the fabric.

### Regular Maintenance

Regular cleaning and maintenance can also help prevent wine stains from setting in. Vacuum your upholstery regularly to remove dirt and spills before they become problematic. Consider having your furniture professionally cleaned once a year to keep it looking its best.

### Final Tips

Remember, prompt action is key when dealing with wine stains. The longer the stain sits, the harder it becomes to remove. Keep a stash of cleaning supplies near areas where spills are common, like dining rooms or living rooms. With these steps, you can quickly address wine spills and maintain the pristine condition of your upholstery.

DIY Solutions: Natural Remedies for Wine Stains on Furniture
------------------------------------------------------------

When you're dealing with a wine spill on upholstery, quick action can make all the difference. Whether it's a casual dinner party gone wrong or a clumsy moment during a cozy evening, knowing how to tackle wine stains naturally can save your furniture from permanent damage. Here are some effective DIY solutions you can try right away.

### Natural Remedies for Wine Stains on Furniture

Before you reach for harsh chemicals, consider these gentle, natural remedies that can help remove wine stains from your upholstery:

#### Immediate Action

*   **Blot the stain:** As soon as the spill happens, grab paper towels or a clean cloth and blot the stain gently. Avoid rubbing the stain, as this can spread the wine deeper into the fabric.
    
*   **Dilute with cold water:** If the stain is still wet, use cold water to dilute the wine. Apply the water gently, and continue blotting until the excess liquid is absorbed.
    

#### Baking Soda and Vinegar Solution

A mixture of baking soda and vinegar can work wonders on wine stains. Here’s how to use it:

*   Mix one part white vinegar with two parts water in a spray bottle.
    
*   Spray the solution onto the stain and let it sit for about five minutes.
    
*   Blot the area with a clean cloth to absorb the liquid.
    
*   Sprinkle baking soda over the damp area and let it sit for another five minutes.
    
*   Once the baking soda has dried, vacuum it up.
    

#### Club Soda

Club soda is another effective remedy because of its carbonation and acidity, which can help lift the stain. Follow these steps:

*   Pour club soda directly onto the stain and let it sit for a few minutes.
    
*   Blot the area with a clean cloth to absorb the club soda and the stain.
    
*   Repeat the process until the stain is no longer visible.
    

#### Hydrogen Peroxide Solution

If the stain persists, hydrogen peroxide can be used as a more potent solution. However, test this method on an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t discolor your upholstery:

*   Mix one part hydrogen peroxide with two parts water in a spray bottle.
    
*   Spray the solution onto the stain and let it sit for about 10 minutes.
    
*   Rinse the area with cold water and blot dry with a clean towel.
    

#### Enzyme Cleaner

For stubborn stains, an enzyme cleaner can be particularly effective. Enzymes break down the proteins in the wine, making them easier to remove:

*   Apply the enzyme cleaner according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
    
*   Let it sit for the recommended time, usually 15-30 minutes.
    
*   Blot the area with a clean cloth to absorb the cleaner.
    
*   Rinse with cold water and let it air dry.
    

#### Preventive Measures

To prevent future wine spills from becoming a nightmare, here are some preventive tips:

*   Use coasters under glasses to catch any drips or spills.
    
*   Keep a stain remover handy for quick cleanup.
    
*   Regularly clean your upholstery to keep it free from stains and odors.
    

#### Professional Help

Despite your best efforts, some stains might be too stubborn to remove. In such cases, professional upholstery cleaning services can offer a thorough and reliable solution. They have specialized equipment and products designed to tackle tough stains without damaging the fabric.

#### Final Tips

Remember, different fabrics may require different approaches. Always test any cleaning solution on a small, hidden area first to ensure it doesn’t cause any damage or discoloration. Additionally, act quickly when dealing with spills to increase the chances of successful stain removal.

With these natural remedies and preventive measures, you can handle wine stains on your upholstery effectively and efficiently. Enjoy your wine without worrying about the aftermath!

Professional Cleaning Products: Choosing the Right One for Your Upholstery
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to maintaining the beauty and longevity of your upholstery, choosing the right professional cleaning products is crucial. Whether you're dealing with stubborn stains or simply want to keep your furniture looking fresh, selecting the appropriate cleaner can make a significant difference. Here’s how to navigate the world of upholstery cleaners and ensure you pick the best one for your needs.

First, it's important to identify the type of fabric your upholstery is made of. Common materials include cotton, leather, microfiber, and velvet. Each fabric has different care requirements, so knowing what you’re working with is essential. For instance, cotton and microfiber are generally more forgiving and can handle a wider range of cleaning solutions compared to delicate fabrics like silk or velvet.

### Understanding Fabric Labels

Most upholstery comes with a label that indicates the recommended cleaning method. These labels are often found under cushions or along the edges of the furniture. They typically use codes such as **S**, **W**, **SW**, or **X**. An **S** code means the upholstery can be cleaned with water-free solvents, while a **W** code indicates that water-based cleaning solutions are safe. **SW** means both solvents and water can be used, and **X** suggests that only vacuuming is recommended. Always refer to these labels before choosing a cleaning product.

### Choosing the Right Cleaner

Once you know the fabric type and cleaning code, you can start selecting the appropriate cleaner. For general maintenance, look for products labeled as ""fabric protectors"" or ""stain repellents."" These can help prevent future stains and keep your upholstery looking new. If you have a specific stain to tackle, choose a cleaner designed for that type of stain. For example, oil-based stains may require a solvent-based cleaner, while water-based stains might need a water-based solution.

*   **Fabric Protectors:** These are ideal for regular upkeep and can help repel spills and stains.
    
*   **Spot Cleaners:** These are formulated to remove specific types of stains and are often available in spray bottles for easy application.
    
*   **Powdered Cleaners:** These are great for deep cleaning and can be worked into the fabric with a soft brush before vacuuming.
    
*   **Steam Cleaners:** These are powerful tools for deep cleaning and sanitizing upholstery. They work by using hot water vapor to loosen and remove dirt and grime.
    

### DIY vs. Professional Cleaners

While DIY cleaning solutions can be effective, professional cleaners often offer more thorough results. Professional-grade cleaners are designed to handle tough stains and can be more efficient at removing embedded dirt and odors. However, they can also be harsher on fabrics, so it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.

If you opt for a DIY approach, consider making your own cleaning solution using common household items. For example, a mixture of dish soap and warm water can be effective for many types of stains. Just be sure to test the solution on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the fabric.

### Additional Tips for Upholstery Care

Beyond choosing the right cleaner, there are several other tips to keep your upholstery looking its best:

*   **Avoid Direct Sunlight:** Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause fabrics to fade. Consider using curtains or blinds to protect your upholstery from direct sunlight.
    
*   **Regular Vacuuming:** Regularly vacuuming your upholstery can help remove dust and debris that can accumulate over time. Use attachments designed for upholstery to avoid damaging the fabric.
    
*   **Immediate Stain Removal:** Promptly addressing spills and stains can prevent them from setting in. Blot the stain immediately with a clean cloth and apply a suitable cleaner as soon as possible.
    
*   **Professional Cleaning:** Even with regular care, professional cleaning every year or two can help maintain the appearance and extend the life of your upholstery.
    

Choosing the right professional cleaning product for your upholstery involves understanding the fabric type, consulting the cleaning code, and selecting a cleaner that matches the specific needs of your furniture. By following these guidelines and incorporating regular maintenance practices, you can keep your upholstery looking fresh and vibrant for years to come.

Preventive Measures: How to Protect Your Furniture from Spills
--------------------------------------------------------------

Protecting your furniture from spills is essential for maintaining its appearance and longevity. Whether it's a luxurious leather sofa or a delicate fabric armchair, spills can leave lasting marks if not addressed promptly. Here are some effective preventive measures to safeguard your furniture from accidental spills.

### Choose the Right Fabrics

When selecting upholstery for your furniture, opt for materials that are easier to clean and more spill-resistant. For instance, microfiber and synthetic fabrics are great choices because they resist stains better than natural fibers like cotton or linen. Additionally, consider treating your upholstery with fabric protectors, which create a barrier against spills and stains.

#### Selecting Appropriate Upholstery Materials

Microfiber is particularly effective due to its tightly woven threads, which prevent liquids from penetrating deeply into the fabric. Similarly, synthetic blends often incorporate water-repellent properties, making them less likely to absorb spills. Always check the care label for cleaning instructions before purchasing.

##### Applying Fabric Protectors

Fabric protectors can be applied after purchase to enhance spill resistance. These products form a microscopic shield over the fabric, allowing spills to bead up and wipe away easily. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for application, as some protectors may require reapplication after a certain period.

### Place Protective Covers

Using protective covers can add an extra layer of defense against spills. These covers come in various styles and materials, designed to fit different types of furniture. They not only protect against spills but also help maintain the furniture’s appearance by shielding it from everyday wear and tear.

#### Types of Protective Covers

For sofas and chairs, consider slipcovers that can be easily removed for washing. For dining room chairs, seat covers offer a practical solution. Some covers are made from waterproof materials, providing additional protection against liquid spills.

##### Maintenance Tips for Protective Covers

Regularly clean protective covers according to the care instructions provided. This helps ensure they remain effective in preventing spills from reaching the upholstery underneath. It’s also wise to have a few extra covers on hand for quick replacements when one becomes soiled.

### Use Trays and Drink Holders

In areas where spills are most likely to occur, such as living rooms and family rooms, placing trays or drink holders can minimize the risk of accidents. These accessories provide designated spaces for drinks and snacks, reducing the likelihood of spills onto the furniture.

#### Strategic Placement of Trays and Drink Holders

Position trays on coffee tables, end tables, and side tables near seating areas. For larger gatherings, consider using coasters and placemats to further protect surfaces. These small additions can significantly reduce the chance of spills landing directly on the furniture.

##### Maintaining Cleanliness Around the Home

Encourage household members to keep their immediate surroundings tidy. Regularly clean up spills and crumbs, as these can lead to stains if left unattended. A clean environment not only looks better but also minimizes the risk of accidental damage.

### Immediate Response to Spills

Despite your best efforts, spills can still happen. Knowing how to respond quickly can prevent minor incidents from becoming major problems. Here are some steps to take immediately after a spill occurs:

#### Act Quickly

The sooner you address a spill, the better. Blot the spill with a clean, dry cloth to absorb as much liquid as possible. Avoid rubbing the spill, as this can spread the stain deeper into the fabric.

##### Use Appropriate Cleaning Solutions

Depending on the type of spill and the fabric, you may need different cleaning solutions. For water-based spills, a mixture of mild dish soap and warm water can work effectively. For oil-based spills, use a solvent-based cleaner specifically designed for fabric.

#### Test Cleaning Solutions

Before applying any cleaning solution to the entire affected area, test it on a small, inconspicuous section of the upholstery first. This ensures that the solution does not damage or discolor the fabric.

##### Dry the Area Thoroughly

After cleaning, use a clean, dry towel to blot the area until no more moisture is absorbed. Allow the upholstery to air dry completely. Avoid using heat sources like hairdryers, as excessive heat can set stains permanently.

### Regular Maintenance and Care

Regular maintenance is key to keeping your furniture looking its best. Incorporate cleaning and inspection routines into your home care schedule to catch potential issues early.

#### Cleaning Routines

Schedule periodic deep cleans for your furniture, especially if it sees frequent use. Use appropriate cleaning products and tools recommended for your upholstery type. Vacuum regularly to remove dirt and debris that can contribute to wear and tear.

##### Professional Help

If you encounter stubborn stains or require specialized cleaning techniques, consider hiring professional cleaners. They have the expertise and equipment to handle tough jobs without damaging the upholstery.

By implementing these preventive measures and responding quickly to spills, you can significantly extend the life and beauty of your furniture. Remember, a little effort now can save you from costly repairs and replacements down the line.

Upholstery Care Tips: Maintaining Your Furniture Long-Term
----------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to maintaining your upholstery over the long-term, understanding how to properly care for it can make all the difference. Whether you're dealing with delicate fabrics or more robust materials, regular upkeep can ensure your furniture looks great for years to come. Here are some essential tips to keep your upholstery in top condition.

### Cleaning Regularly

Maintaining clean upholstery starts with regular cleaning. Dust, dirt, and spills can accumulate over time, leading to stains and wear. Vacuuming your upholstery once a week is a good practice. Use the appropriate attachment for your fabric type—soft brushes for delicate fabrics and bristle attachments for tougher spots. If you have pets, consider vacuuming more frequently as pet hair can quickly build up.

#### Deep Cleaning Solutions

For deeper cleaning, you might want to rent a steam cleaner or hire a professional. Steam cleaning can remove embedded dirt and grime, and it's especially useful for heavily used areas like living room sofas. Always test a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure the cleaner doesn't damage or discolor the fabric.

##### DIY Cleaning Options

*   **Vinegar Solution:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Apply the solution with a spray bottle, let it sit for a few minutes, then blot with a clean cloth.
    
*   **Baking Soda:** Sprinkle baking soda over the upholstery, let it sit overnight, then vacuum it up. This helps absorb odors and can help remove minor stains.
    
*   **Club Soda:** For fresh spills, club soda can be effective. Pour it onto the spill, let it soak for a few minutes, then blot dry.
    

### Spotting Stains Promptly

Immediate action is key when it comes to stain removal. The longer a spill sits, the harder it becomes to remove. For spills, start by blotting up as much of the liquid as possible with a clean, dry cloth. Avoid rubbing, which can spread the stain and embed it further into the fabric.

#### Common Stain Removal Tips

*   **Red Wine:** Blot immediately with a clean cloth. For stubborn stains, mix one tablespoon dish soap, one tablespoon white vinegar, and two cups warm water. Apply the solution with a sponge, then blot dry.
    
*   **Oil-Based Stains:** Use cornstarch or talcum powder to absorb the oil. Let it sit for several hours, then vacuum up the powder before cleaning the area with a mild detergent solution.
    
*   **Ink:** Use rubbing alcohol or hairspray. Apply the solvent to a cotton ball and gently dab the stain until it lifts.
    

### Protective Measures

To prevent future damage, consider protective measures. Fabric protectors can create a barrier against spills and stains. These products are available in spray form and can be applied easily at home. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions and test on a small area first.

#### Choosing the Right Products

Not all protectors are created equal. Look for products designed for the specific type of fabric you have. Some protectors work better on synthetic fibers, while others are more effective on natural materials like cotton or wool. Consult with a professional or do some research online to find the best product for your upholstery.

### Professional Help

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, your upholstery may need professional attention. Professional cleaners have access to specialized equipment and solutions that can tackle tough stains and deep-seated dirt. They can also offer advice on maintaining your upholstery based on its specific needs.

#### How to Choose a Professional Cleaner

*   **Check Reviews:** Look for reviews online to see what other customers say about their experiences.
    
*   **Ask for Recommendations:** Ask friends, family, or neighbors for recommendations. Personal referrals can often lead to reliable professionals.
    
*   **Verify Credentials:** Ensure the cleaner is licensed and insured. This protects both you and the cleaner in case of any accidents or damages.
    

### Regular Maintenance Tips

Maintaining your upholstery isn’t just about cleaning; it’s also about regular maintenance. Rotate cushions regularly to ensure even wear. This can extend the life of your furniture significantly. Additionally, keep your upholstery away from direct sunlight to avoid fading and damage from UV rays.

#### Additional Maintenance Tips

*   **Avoid Sharp Objects:** Keep sharp objects like keys and scissors away from your upholstery to prevent accidental tears.
    
*   **Use Protective Covers:** Consider using throw covers on high-traffic areas. These can be easily removed and washed, protecting your upholstery from everyday wear and tear.
    
*   **Professional Inspection:** Have your upholstery professionally inspected every few years. They can spot issues early and recommend the best course of action to keep your furniture looking its best.
    

By following these tips, you can ensure that your upholstery remains in excellent condition for years to come. Remember, prevention is key, and regular care will save you time and money in the long run.

### Conclusion

1iprk06,https://i.redd.it/hsfj81qtr7je1.jpeg,Found an Oasis (Al Nuaim) in the desert (literally),"So, only yesterday I posted about Cool Weather attar and two guys pointed out to buy attars from local shop for better testing and pricing. I didn't know any such shop is around me, a small town in Kutch, Gujarat. (So, desert, literally).

Last evening, I entered a recently opened Agarbatti shop and got a sweet shock when I saw this rack full of Al Nuaim attars !! What more, the 60ish guy himself is in fragrance business (mainly pooja materials) since 2 generations and had much knowledge (and coffee beans to smell) too !!

I smelt handful of Al Nuaim (basically I was being shy as he was so friendly to open all packs for me regardless I buy or not). Tuscan Leather felt Tobacco heavy so I thought would buy in next winter. (Later I found this is clone of same named famous perfume).

At the same time, there was a notification from this group. Describing Club De Nuit clone of this brand. I asked, he showed me Delicia (in first picture). And said CDN clone is replaced with this name. I smelt it but couldn't get any note clearly. He applied Blueberry one on my wrist. Was a fruity blast. Lasted even after I washed hands 1 hr later.

In the end, I bought Black Opum (would review later) for just 80 bucks. Have gone noseblind so would review later.

Please see all the pics and let me know if any recommendations from you guys.

1iprj8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CongratsLikeImFive/comments/1iprj8a/called_a_girl_cute_in_public/,Called a girl cute in public,"I've never been in a real relationship, and tbh this isn't a real relationship either, due to several timing related-reasons. However, I have been out with people I've had casual relationships with before and the rule has always been discretion so no one gets the idea that we're together. Just act like friends, because that's all we are. 

As a bi woman, this is also the first time I've properly been with another woman, so that also adds to the ""first time excitement"" of the whole thing, but I went out to coffee with a fwb and called her cute and she called me cute back and there was no hesitation. No making sure no one heard. No worrying about someone thinking we might be together. It was just a lovely little moment between us, and in general she's expressed that she's perfectly fine with people knowing we're hooking up and hanging out and stuff. 

I've never had that before and it's made me strangely emotional. I guess I didn't realize how much it sucked to be seen as something to be hidden or kept secret, even when the motivation for it wasn't shame at being seen with me in that way (though sometimes it definitely was). I guess I just wanted to get that out there and get a little pat on the back for both the situation and allowing myself to be that open in public, though it was an admittedly small thing.",13,1739586449.0,CongratsLikeImFive,1,1.0,False
1iprj3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iprj3n/its_valentine_day_i_feel_lonely_right_now_and/,"Its Valentine Day, I feel lonely right now and want to vent about my last break up.","I'm just looking to get it out of my chest, ask any questions or tell me your stories. (Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my main language)  


TL;DR version at the end.

  
So, last December I reconnected with this girl I met 5 years ago (I'm 31 and she was 33). I always liked her and we followed each other but we never really talked that much. We met at this bar and things took of from there.

  
I always thought she would be nice partner based on what I saw in social media (I know, dumb on my part) she talked a lot about being multiple long term relationships, being faithful and open. She also liked traveling and photography a lot; which I am a fan too.  
We started going out and the chemistry was there (emotionally, intellectually, sexually) I always felt we would click but goddamn I did not expect to click that much.  
Weeks go by and we are talking a lot about a future, we talked about how we didn't want to rush anything but we could see each other dating long term.  
For some reason I always felt we would date either 2 weeks or 2 years (most of my friends told me the same which will become kind of funny at the end)  
  
One day we go out with some of my friends so I can introduce her to them bc I think since we will end up being long term, might as well introduce them right away (foolish of me, I always try o avoid that)  I am ordering some food and my friend tells me some guys seems to be hitting on her. I go just to check the situation and she starts acting very weird around that guy and his friend. I try to pay no mind but at some point its clear that she likes their attention, I get pissed and jealous and I tell her straight forward that I don't like how she is behaving around them, the guys starts telling her that I'm clearly very jealous and she keeps talking to him for a while before coming to my side.  


My friends clearly think the whole thing is super fishy on how she is behaving and the whole mood gets super tense. We go out of the bar to a super market and I tell her how her attitude was super wrong, she tries to tell me I'm making a huge drama out of nowhere and I tell her she is downplaying my emotions, I'm just communicating something that made me feel uncomfortable and if it was the other way around, she would have felt the same (already had a partner that gaslighted me and made me feel it was always me making drama, so I got experience).   
She ends up accepting she messed up and telling me on her eyes, its only the first week we are dating (its been a month at this point) and that she still is unsure if she really wants to date me long term.  
We spend the whole evening talking, I tell her that she is clearly still putting a barrier between us, that I'm 100% certain I want to be with her and that if she pushes me away but doesn't let me go, that really ends up hurting long term and if that was the case it would be better to break up. She tells me that night that the the idea of breaking up scares her a lot and that she is convinced she wants to keep trying.

I tell her to see it as a bump on the road and now we now need to set clear limits however inside me I was like, ok this is the first strike, 2 more and I need to get out of there.

  
We both go to our houses, get some rest and continue the conversation the next days. She tells me to get ready because she is now going full throttle, no regrets or fears and for me to be ready for her becoming intense. I tel her I'm ready and we move on.

She starts sending me a bunch of zodiac compatibility between ourselves and how intense things are and will be (I know, I know... She was one of those but I liked it) and we talk about how we are indeed very intense, pationate and that we would help each other grow a lot. We go out every day or every 2 days and she is constantly telling me how much she loves me, that she wants to have my children and how it will be like when we move together.

  
At this point everything is going amazing and I feel extremely happy with her. Its been a long time since I felt like that with a partner.

  
I tell her that I was going to Mexico to see a show on March and I was planning on staying there for 3 weeks. She tells me she was planning the same thing around the same time and eventually the conversation evolves to ""Lets travel together!"". We both get super excited and start looking tickets, where to stay, shows that we could go, etc. I go back from my house excited that one of my dreams is becoming true (flying with a partner and seeing a new country)

This was the beginning of the end...

A week goes by, we are seeing the possibility of how we could fly together (she got fired the same day we started going out; so she had a bunch of money saved but was trying to see how she could spend less). It gets kind of tough with the whole logistic for different reasons. I tell her that the next time we see each other we can sit down and see what chances we got. She says ok and the week goes normal. 

We are talking on instagram; I sent her a reel about questions that you should ask your partner and she tells me, this is super important, the next time we see we also need to talk about this. I tell her I'm okay with it and agree to do it.  


She comes to my house, we are talking normally and she sits me down and tells me the classic ""we need to talk"". I get super anxious, she sits down and starts telling me she is unsure about the trip for multiple reasons, I ask her about it and she starts telling me a bunch of reasons that contradict each other ""example: I was thinking about moving and living there full time so I can work and stay with friends, but I met you and things have changed"" and then ""No I would never go there and live full time, I have too much things here, it would be only for 2 months"".  
She starts going in circles and I have to get serious and stop her, I look her in the eyes and tell her ""I need you to be fully clear to me about the exact reasons why you are doubting; if its because of the fact that you are unemployed and are scared about the money, then say it; if its because you think its too soon for us or there is something that you don't like about me, then please tell me but be straight forward with me. I do not like the fact that you seem to be using all kinds of excuses instead of just telling me the truth"".

  
She gets serious and tells me ""you know, its very tough to lie to you. you can easily see trough me and that makes me afraid."" I joke her back saying ""Hey you were always complaining about how your exes kept everything bottled up and you were asking about a boyfriend that was honest, blunt and straight forward. Now you got one and you realize is not as easy huh?"". She laughs at it and we resume the conversation, however she is still evading pretty much everything until I get upset and tell her to cut the bullshit. She finally opens up and tells me ""The fact that you would be the one paying makes me uncomfortable, I do have money for the trip, but it was considering the fact that I could stay with friends, now if I go with you its different because I'll have to pay more.""

I thank her for admitting it and tell her ""Hey, we don't need to go 50/50 I mean, I was already planning on paying an airbnb, so the money is already budgeted. So we can arrange it in some other way (we split it 75/25, or I handle staying, she handles the food, or some other alternatives). For me the most important part is not the money; is that we travel together and enjoy ourselves.

She ends up agreeing and telling me that yeah we can do that. I feel happy again because the travel is still up and we move on with the questions about the relationship.

  
We go over the questions and there is one in specific ""How does your partner makes you feel valued and what do they do that makes you feel appreciated"". I tell her I like everything she does and go in depth why. She tells me I'm ""almost perfect"" but there are things she doubts or doesn't like. I ask her why and we go into another whole circle of she saying things but nor being clear about any of it until I get upset and ask her to leave the topic there since its very frustrating trying to get the truth out of her like an investigator.  
I won't bore you with the details of the conversation since this post is already very long, but it ends up being ""I don't want to compare you, but my exes did somethings that you don't do that much. Which of course makes me kind of miss those things"". We talk about it and I agree that there are somethings I will look into but there are some that I won't since its now who I am. She says its fine and we move on.

  
Fast forward one week after that, everything is fine, we go out on a Sunday; she comes to my place and hits me with another ""we need to talk"". I get super anxious again and let her speak. She tells me ""Im sorry to bring your illusions down, but I've been thinking about the trip and honestly; I think its better that we don't do it. I feel its to soon for us and honestly, traveling \*brings the worse in people out\*"" I tell her ""hey, its the second time you back out of the trip. I won't keep pushing, it honestly makes me feel very sad but I won't insist anymore. However I d not agree on the ""bringing the worse in people out"" I feel its an amazing experience. Can it have stressful situations? Yes. But is it the worse for people, no.""  
We go into a conversation into why she thinks that is true and I don't; we end up agreeing that we disagree. We try to relax for a while before she goes back to her place but get into another small argument about the trip. I ask there that we leave the topic there and just leave it be for the moment.

She agrees and tells me she has to leave bc she is having dinner with her mom. We say goodbye and keep on chatting trough messages. I open up with her about the ""We need to talk"" openings and how anxious that makes me. I tell her I have some serious traumas with that bc of some past relationships and some issues with my family. She tells me she understands and tells me ""You are right, I could open with Hey, I need to talk about the trip, instead of making a whole scene"". We have a pleasant conversation about it where she seems very understanding.

However, I felt that her energy suddenly shifted, she seemed a little bit more cold on how she replied.

On my side, I felt this was the 2nd strike, bc how it was becoming an emotional rollercoaster.  
I tried to pay no mind and continue my week.  
3 days go by and she is now replying differently (more cold and takes longer to reply). I knew she was on her period but something in me is telling me something changed.

 I tell she that my mom is coming to visit and we text about it casually. She tells me that she is going to have a coffee with a friend in the afternoon and that she expects ""to leave early"". The day goes by normal, I talk with my mom about this ""awesome girl I'm dating, how happy I am and how are views in family, relationship and kids is very similar"" (Just about to make a clown out of myself with my mom)

The girl starts texting me and I tel her I'm sitting down with my mom having some coffee and out of nowhere she starts fighting me (she had done that in the past a few times). She starts complaining about a lot of things, saying that I never invited her to anything and that I made complaints about me expending on her. But that its ""fine"" and she doesn't want to ""make a whole deal about it while I'm with my mom, which of course she just did anyway.  
I ask my mom for some time and start replying to her, I reply to her reassuring her its fine and that I have no issues with any of that. we speak for about half an hour (very stressful by the way, since I had to tell my mom that I had to speak to the girl bc she was feeling very upset.)  
The conversation with her ends up with a ""You are completely right. I actually have nothing to tell you, you always reply so calmly, honest and caring to me when all I wanna do is fight"".  
This raises a huge red flag bc I'm like, bro, so you are telling me you just were bored and wanted to fight?????? I was fine with it other times bc I knew we were joking but doing this serious of an issue while I'm with my mother AND YOU KNOW IT. And still did it just bc you ""felt bored""... that is very fucked up.  
I joke about it and just move on since I just want to go back to spend time with mother.

After that she stops replying for a while and my mom asks me if I'm busy on the weekend, bc she wanted to have lunch with us and meet her in person. I get very uncomfortable bc she is very excited about it but I know something is going on with her so I tell my mom ""let me talk with her and I'll get back at you"".

I send her a text even tough she hadn't replied to my last message and ask her ""hey, what are you doing on the weekend?"". I see the time and its the time she was going to the date with this guy. I try to pay no mind and remain calm.  
However things were about to take a bad twist.

My mom leaves, I'm sitting down and starting to work and start having a bunch of problems at work, my boss ends up calling me and starts to complaining about a lot of things I messed up (half of them I did mess up) and asks me to fix everything ASAP.

I start working super anxious and stressed out. The hours go by and she doesn't reply.  
So I'm trying to fix everything, feeling anxious about my job, starting to get afraid I might get fired.  
And she hasn't replied for hours after going on a date with this random guy.  
The jealousy and paranoia start taking the best of me, I'm trying to work while constantly checking if she had replied. (Not my proudest moment honestly).

She ends up texting me almost 6 hours later and just replies to my question about what she was doing on the weekend saying one day she was going to a show and the other she wanted to go to one but didn't get tickets.  
At this point it is evident she is acting differently (whenever I asked in the past her she would say something like ""I'm busy around this time but we can see each other after that or the next day"").  
I start accepting the fact that probably she isn't feeling it anymore and that its probably time to end things. This is the third strike.  
I text her back with a simple ""Ok"" and she text me back after a while with a ""I'm on my way home now. But why, did want to hang out"" and a smilie face.  
I tell her that I would like to talk in person or call her (We live very close by; 15 minute drive so its never been an issue).  
She is taking a long time between responses and not saying no, but just avoiding the idea of meeting.  
She tells me I'm sorry; I wanted to go to your house but I have a massive headache, so I want to rest in my house"" (she did suffer from those constantly even when we were good) but if I needed to talk we could do it on the phone.  
I ask her about the date and tell her that my mother wanted to meet her on the weekend. 

She told me a lot of details about the date, it ended up being something casual with a friend. She did mention how she didn't like him bc he was too short and yada yada but he always asked her out and that she preferred guys with my height bc she is very short, but the guy was even shorter. etc etc etc.

At this point I don't even care about the whole thing, I just wanted to figure out wtf was going on between us.  
Again she asks me about the weekend and I tell her, well, as I mentioned to you my mom wanted to invite you to have dinner and meet you. But this is like a huge step for me so I need to know we are good before I do, so how are you feeling with us dating? Is there something you want to open up or talk about?   
She sends me a long as audio (almost 9 minutes), with the first half stating how much she loves me, how when we are together everything feels perfect, that we have so much chemistry in all the ways and  even how she has never felt so pleased with any partner (if you catch my drift ;) )  
But its the distance that makes her doubt a lot and she is still not sure if she wants to be with me or not. If I'm even ""the one"" for her even tough I hit all the marks and that she know that this uncertainty is the one hurting me and she doesn't want to tell em these things bc she know its opening the possibility of breaking up, eve tough she understands it might be necessary for me.  
I thank her for her honesty and we go into a long as audio conversation about the whole thing.  
I tell her a lot of things my therapist told me about us, things I noticed and what I was looking for.  
I won't go too much into the details but I opened up about my feelings, how much it was hurting me that she at this point, was still feeling uncertain and holding that emotional barrier with me while I had accepted multiple times to lower for her and that I wanted to be with her.  
I knew we were not good for each other but a part of me held the hope that she would at least try to put a fight for us instead of giving up everything so easy.  
She opened up about a lot of her self esteem, that having no job made her feel very uncertain and that she was facing a lot of issues with herself, her image, and what she wanted to do in life.  
She tells me how she is feeling pressured to get married and have children bc her time is ""running out"" and she feels a lot of pressure form herself and society.

  
At this point I open up about a lot of things I hand't told her, like how she and her friends tell way too much to each other (which also made me uncomfortable bc at points I felt that there was no privacy) and how that influence with the comments they tell her its hurting her on feeling rushed into that. How her family is doing the same and that makes me uncomfortable for her. She openly accepts that its true however she has accepted it as part of her life and that she will never improve in any way-

  
I end up sending her this long as text trying to be super supportive about her self image, how she is and amazing person and her energy is magnetic, how much people like and love her and even why that is a reason so many guys hit on her. I even opened up how I went trough an extremely traumatic experience and it took me years to recover so I believed she could to.

  
Her response about the whole thing baffled me. She did not address anything about the experience I had. She just replied the ""how she amazing person and her energy is magnetic"" part with a. ""but how does that help me? How does that work for me if I don't get what I want?""  


Nah man, I just throw my hands in the air like, really, from the whole thing this is what you got???? Like wtf is this self pity bulltshit.

  
The conversation ends up like:  
Me -So what do you want?

Her -to have a family and... well I don't want to sound basic.

Me -and have kids (I already knew since we spoke about it a ton of times and she even told me she would love to have children with me EVEN IF I LEFT, which I said I would always want to form part of the life of my kids even if we broke up)

Her: - :| (serious emoji)

Me: - I understand. Its very late and I don't think there is much point in moving forward. Its clear that this won't work. Lets leave it at this and we can talk tomorrow so I can return you your stuff.

Her: I know. you know what I take it back. Please forget everything!

Me: you regret what? Breaking up?

Her: Yes. Nevermind.

Me -: I'm sorry, but that uncertainty about everything is the very reason we are breaking up. I don't want to do it but you pushed me to this point. So lets not hurt ourselves any further.  
Her: you are right.

We talk the next day, I tell her that I'll stop by her place to drop her stuff we sit down in her bed, talk about the whole situation. I open up about how frustrated I am about the whole situation, again how I don't want to break up, how its been so long since I found this connection with anyone and she is just letting it go so easily, how for a lot of things she only focused on whats bad.  
Even on how ironic it was the she always brought up the idea of us having children and getting married and now she was not sure she could ""fulfill my expectations "" of getting married and having children. 

Also, how ironic was that she was 33, older than me, and how her decision making and attitudes were very childish at many points.

I mentioned to her her: ""I don't understand how is it that you are so afraid of getting old, losing your chance of having kids and a family; yet you are letting go the one guy that you have clicked so well that wants the same thing as you; I guess it wasn't just meant to be""  
  
The whole time she is just incapable of looking me in the eyes,. She tells me that I'm too strong for being able to look at her directly, telling her those things and that she is glad I'm the one breaking up with her because she never could.

We end up embracing each other, just hugging. Accepting and feeling that bittersweet feeling of how good we feel each other but we are both letting it go.  
We end up kissing and having break up S3X. One of the best we both had.  
We laugh about it and I tell her, this is what you are letting go right? Just want to make that clear haha.

We get dressed and joke about the whole thing like the old times.  
\-I tell her so what now, do you want to go for a beer in our last evening? 

She accepts and asks me where? I say: Hey, lets go to the bar where we both went in our second date, kind of where we both accepted we were going to start dating officially so I have my dramatic closure.

We laugh about it and go there. We have a beer and a meal and joke about all the things we didn't end up doing; how the name of our kids were going to waste and how I wished her luck since I knew her next partners would suck in bed (running joke we had).

We talk about how we felt this was not a ""goodbye forever"" but a ""See you someday"". I leave to go meet with a friend for another beer since I knew if I got home I would feel like shit and not sleep.

We give each other one last kiss and leave.  
We kept texting casually for the next weekend. We both traveled for different reasons and kind of have a similar experience of going out of out city into nature to clear out.

I come back to my house on monday after traveling and accept the fact I have to let it go, but one part of me doesn't. I struggle with it a lot.  
She reminded me on our last night that I forgot to bring her something she left, so I could give it back.   
I text her to let me know when she is home so I can send it to her. She says ""sure, but there is no rush.""  
I just say ok, and we don't speak the next 2 days.

I make the decision to still fly to Mexico by myself and buy the tickets

  
This past days I really struggled with the whole situation, between accepting the fact that it won't work and wanting to talk. I felt that I had to leave my ego aside and just accept I missed her and try to talk as friends at least and let my anger and frustration go.

Yesterday I messaged her asking her how she was doing. We talked casually about how we were feeling and accepted its been tough.  
I asked her, hey, do you want to go out and have some coffee and we can talk.  
She tells me ""Of course, I will always accept a coffee date; but we need to go somewhere cheap because Im need to save money since I bough my tickets to Mexico"" (a little bit ironic haha)

I tell her I did the same and if she wanted to meet either today or tomorrow for the coffee, that we could go to a cheap cafeteria or I could go to her house so we didn't spend as much.

  
She hasn't replied since, at this point its clear that she is ghosting me.

I don't regret texting her because it was part of letting everything go. I do feel a little bit as a clown though haha, but hey. Its part of the process. Its just sucked that everything matched with Valentine and I see all this happy couples on Instagram while I'm sitting here feeling like a fool.

  
Oh and the whole 2 weeks vs 2 years dating? First my friends made the bet that it wasn't going to last more than 2 months (I didn't know). After a month when they saw me I was falling in love (they never seen me like that with a girl) they changed the bet and gave different ranges within the 2 years and that she was breaking up with me in the end.

Then I came back and told them I broke up with her they all complained and told me about the bet saying they betted for it to last longer. My best friend said ""bro c'mon, you were my horse, I betted everything for your long run lmao; now I lost the bet""  I just laughed since I've done the same bet with other friends.

Any toughts, do you feeling it was love bombing? Was I being fooled? Was I very immature with the situation?

  
TL;DR

I started going out with this friend from years ago. We have so much chemistry its insane. Shew tells me she wants to get married and have kids in the future. We start planning a travel together to Mexico,  everything is well. Suddenly she backs down; starts getting distant and tells me she is not sure about having a future with me even tought she loves me. I have to breakup with her. We dated for 2 months.  
Now she is ghosting me on valentines.",2,1739586438.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I 16f and my dad, 51m 6 monthsish ago moved out from the apartment we lived in with my step mom, 47f. 
This will be long because the background information is very important, and a lot. 
8 years of my life a lot, lmao.
At 7 i met my step mom, dad and her dated for a few long years and got married when I was 9. 
2018 they got jobs far out of where we lived. 
To much gas, not enough money. 
We moved out of town away from family and friends, turned out to be the worst decision ever lmao. 
Before this, step mom, I'll call ms was always like my mom, if someone asked who my mom was I'd say it was S. 
(Bio mom is a deadbeat abuser) 
In our new home, ms's  cousin (also my parents boss) 
Started to tell her that my dad was cheating and he had children with another woman at work. 
Dad had quit so money was tight, so money and (allegedly) infidelity problems, obviously they fought, a lot. 
That's normal, what's not normal is the intensity, ms and dad would scream so loud cops would be called. 
Ms got depressed to the point of thinking about taking her life. 
On my 10th birthday, 2019, shit hit the fan. 
My dad posted a happy birthday announcement on his Facebook for me,
Well, Ms, lost. Her. Danm. Shit. 
She screamed at him all morning, accused him of being a pedophile, and wanting a sexual relationship with me, (yk, his 10 year old DAUGHTER.) 
She called the cops on him, so everyone was questioned by police officers, I had to answer questions to a cop on my 10th birthday (happy 10th birthday!!) 
All I remember from that day is the fight, my step brother, N telling me it was all my fault because I just never listen, and telling the nice(?) Cop, it's my birthday. 
Eventually after some major issues happened, Ms's depression, N skipping school and smoking joints, and me hurting myself, we moved back just before covid. 
I spent grade 6 in online school lol, 
The most I remember from that house was when Ms threw dad's phone outside and smashed it, and more cop involment, N moving out because Ms couldn't buy expensive stuff. Then R moving in because of attempting multiple times. 
Me and ms were never close again, not like how she was to her sons, I didn't fully grasp that I had lost my mom after everything. 

Summer of 2022 I think, we moved into another house, I loved this house lol, and my room, I really miss my room :(
Some fights here and there, no cops, my mental health was bad as always, but everyone was rightfully focused on R. 

February 2023, we could no longer afford to rent there, stress built up, and it exploded, ms and dad fought, and a few days before my 14th birthday, Ms and R moved out, into a pre paid TWO bedroom apartment, planning to leave me and dad alone. 
I think that was the moment when I realized I had lost my mom, she was willing to abandon me, just like that? It really effected me badly. 
Eventually dad forgave her and we moved in, for a year or two I slept on a mattress on the floor, or on the couch and like Harry potter I had a little closet for my pc LMAO. 

September 2024, a two days before my second year of high-school, me and Ms argued over noodles in a bowl, (stupid right?) Yeah, she hated me cooking even though I was 15 lmao. 
I guess this put an seed for an argument between dad and Ms, because the next morning around 6, my dad is shaking me awake and telling me to get some stuff together, important stuff and we needed to go in that moment, in the car he told me she hit him, three times. 
And ever since then, we've been living at my grandparents. 

Here's what I need advice on, my dad frequently goes over to have coffee ect ect. 
I'm always reaching out to her, never the other way around, and conveniently when she says she messages me but I never answer, somehow I never get them. 
Lately, after new years when she didn't answer me, I stopped reaching out. I have learnt from bio mom it hurts way more to reach out and beg for a reply, than it does to just drop off. 
Her birthday was yesterday, I didn't wish her a happy birthday, dad got her a card, and wrote my name on it. It made me mad, which I shouldn't be, lol, I should be the bigger person, but ever since my 10th birthday, I've only ever gotten a shitty birthday where I'm alone or she starts an argument with dad, and my dad is the only one to get me a birthday card, not once from her, not even signed, so why should I be the bigger person, when all she does it hurt me? She makes no effort, and recently I've learnt she never has. She never spends one on one time with me without turning it into a danm fight. She makes me feel like a burden, and being near her makes me spiral back into old destructive habits. But I can tell living at my grandparents is weighing on everyone. My dad is stressed because my grandparents are stressed. The easy thing to do would be to just say fuck it, and move back in with Ms, even though I think I might actually die, but it's only basically two years before I could move out. I've lived 6 years with these feelings and issues, maybe I could survive two more years. 
Idk, I love my dad, and seeing him cry destroys me, I just want to make things easier for him. 
Any advice is appreciated, hell even calling me out on bullshit lmao, maybe I'm being a spoiled brat who is butt hurt over something not that deep. 
 
I don't have internet at home right now, so I won't be able to answer questions right away if anyone has some, sorry:'(",1,1739586309.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone!

My wife (32F) and I (37M) are looking to meet some fun, like-minded couples in Toronto who enjoy:

	•	Movies – We love everything from mind-bending thrillers to fun comedies, and we’re always up for a great film discussion after.
	•	Board & Card Games – Into strategy-based games (Catan, Ticket to Ride) as well as chill card games that don’t end in a full-blown war.
	•	Weekend Hikes & Walks – Nothing too extreme, but we enjoy discovering new trails and outdoor spots (bonus if there’s a good café or brewery nearby!).
	•	Cafés & Restaurants – We’re always on the hunt for great coffee, cozy vibes, and food spots (we’re vegetarians).

We don’t have kids, and we’d love to meet other couples who enjoy a similar lifestyle—having the flexibility for spontaneous game nights, weekend outings, or just grabbing coffee without too much scheduling stress. If you and your partner are also looking for new friends to hang out with, drop us a message or comment! Maybe we start with a casual café meetup or a game night and see where it goes?

Looking forward to meeting some awesome people! 🎲🎬☕.",3,1739586294.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,0,1.0,False

1iprh1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/pancreatitis/comments/1iprh1y/back_pain/,Back pain,"Hey guys. I am 17 years old. I had many problems due to my irresponsibility during my live. I gor prescribed medicines and diets, but ended up smoking weed and giving an absolute fuck about everything I had to do. 

So, last time I was drinking pretty much of coffee and eating sweets for a month cause I was smoking weed, and just couldn’t stop. Last time I visited the doctor before I started to do it I made ultrasound and got told that my pancreas is a little bit bigger, but absolutely not critically. Also I have my elastase like 166 last time. 

Like 2 weeks ago when I ended up with all that whit I was doing to my health I noticed a constant back pain in the night. Like burning. It could last for many hours. I also got told by a doctor that I had a bile stasis, so I decided to take choleretics ( I thought my back pain was due to this) So after 2 weeks of taking choleretics I woke up and drank a water and felt a pain in my solar plexus. Then I had a breakfast and started to feel like my left part of abdomen is heavy. I wasn’t eating healthy ( fried, sauces etc) That day after other unhealthy meal I felt a stabbing pain in left abdomen. I immediately texted to one doctor in Ukraine( I am in Spain rn and am not going back) and she told me she can’t prescribe me anything cause it harms in 99% cases. But she told to get rid of choleretics FOREVER. I did as she said and then had a trip to Madrid. I couldn’t really eat healthy there so I ate unhealthy dimplings with sauces and in few hours for the first time felt severe pain in left abdomen even though I took Creon before. Rn I am on a diet ( no frying, spices, sauces etc) Haven’t had severe pain episodes since. Sometimes I can feel a little pain in left abdomen, mostly when I consume food that ends up in few minutes and radiates to the back. Since I still have severe back pains. But I sometimes ate few cookies, avocados. So am thinking about stopping consuming high-fat products for a while.
I really don’t think I have a chronic pancreatitis. Cause I don’t really have symptoms like nausea, my shit look ok, but I have yellow dotes in it. But it doesn’t look really bad tbh. When I had enzyme deficiency I had the same looking shit. So the only problem is that I lost 2kg and also have a burning really agonising back pain in the night. I really don’t have any opportunity to see my doctor here in Spain . In most cases they won’t do any diagnostics and will just prescribe some medications that will destroy your health even more. So now I am on Creon 10000 after each meal that’s it. Hope my pain will disappear soon cause it’s really painful and I am just 17😭

I hope sport ( I train 2 day a day judo), sleep, diet will help.

P.s Oh, I also take antibiotics rn for 5 days. That’s it, I had a severe sinusitis. My immune system is fucked  ( due to no sleep schedule and weed, bad diet, alcohol) Yeah I know I did a lot of mistakes and hope to recover and get well soon.

Wish me luck. Also if you can advice me something tell me.",1,1739586240.0,pancreatitis,3,1.0,False

1ipreh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ipreh7/is_this_what_adulthood_is_like/,Is this what Adulthood is like?,"Growing up, friendships felt effortless. There was this deep sense of togetherness—like no matter what, you had people who genuinely cared, who checked in on you, who had your back through thick and thin. Sleepovers, late-night conversations, hanging out for no reason—friendships felt pure, built on a foundation of shared experiences and emotional support rather than convenience.

But as I’ve gotten older, that feeling of brotherhood and belonging seems to have completely disappeared. Adult friendships often feel transactional—only maintained as long as there’s some material benefit involved. Maybe it’s work connections, networking opportunities, or someone needing a favor. But once that purpose is served, the friendship quietly fades away. It’s like people don’t see value in relationships unless there’s something to gain from them.

Even when I try to genuinely connect with people, it feels like everyone is “too busy” with their lives. And sure, I get it—work, responsibilities, family obligations. But at the same time, I see those same people scrolling on TikTok for hours, binge-watching shows, or going out only when it benefits them in some way. It makes me wonder: are people really that busy, or do they just not care enough to maintain friendships anymore?

I remember back in school or college, friendships didn’t require constant effort or scheduling. If you liked someone, you just spent time with them. You didn’t have to book a time weeks in advance just to catch up over coffee. Now, everything feels like a chore. People will say, “Let’s catch up soon!” but deep down, you both know it probably won’t happen.

It’s made me question whether I’m just bad at making or keeping friends, or if this is just an inevitable part of adulthood. Does everyone feel this way? Does everyone just silently deal with this loneliness and pretend it’s normal? Because if so, that’s kind of depressing.

I try to remind myself that I still have my family, and I’m grateful for that. But sometimes, I wonder—outside of them, is there really anyone who truly has my back? Or is adulthood just a slow realization that, in the end, you’re mostly on your own?

Would love to hear if others feel the same way. Am I overthinking it, or is this just how life works as you get older?",1,1739585997.0,offmychest,0,0.67,False
