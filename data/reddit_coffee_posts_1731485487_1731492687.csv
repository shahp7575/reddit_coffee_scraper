But this was more in the beginning. Now I've been on my own cheap intestinal cleansing protocol for 5 days, and I still get like one methane smelling burp at the first morning dose, but then it stops, I think, as I've not been tracking this exactly, as I just got this idea.

So as my stomach is usually slow, and has been all my life, and I've had mild brain fog since like 8-9 years old. I don't suffer many symptoms, and especially having experimented with many different healthy ways of eating (although from seeing here how a unique microbiome makes a healthy diet very hard to define beyond getting all the essentials).

The only real relief I've felt was when fasting, and particularly doing enemas. But that's hardly sustainable. But my dysbiosis isn't severe, I've recently been very healthy, but got ""the varus"" again, and I've been tired and foggy since spring. I think there are many cases like me, where you function just well enough and can push yourself when necessary, and adjust your diet to function well enough. But you'll never see them seeking medical help to begin with, as it's just fatigue and brain fog and small aches and pains.

So the experimental intestinal cleanse is basically activated carbon (about one tea spoon in plenty of water), chased with some fibre like 15 minutes after. Psyllium may be better, but I'm powdering chia seeds until I get psyllium. And then I just eat a small lunch and big dinner. But since yesterday I modified it to having no lunch and just some olive oil 2-3 times for some energy, antimicrobial action, and bile flow. I've also read about having low stomach acid can cause low motility, and may be a root cause of some dysbiosis cases. So I'm taking 50/50 of acv with water before a meal.

I've experimented with activated carbon before, and it's given me some extra energy and mental clarity, but as I have low motility, and it makes poop very sticky and hard, it was unsustainable by itself + food. It eventually caused constipation. But with the chia fibre and magnesium citrate, it's less constipating.

So that's what I'm doing. It's working pretty well. I'm also having coffee in the morning after a year of being off of it. To keep things moving.
It's quite interesting reading people's experiences here and on other dysbiosis-relared subreddits. Hopefully we can find cheap and effective solutions for everyone. Most health problems probably originate from some kind of microbiome issue.

So do you get methane burps when consuming activated carbon?",1,1731492582.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

What happened between us a few days ago was something I'll never forget.

I'm Phoebe, 31, and I own a modest three-bedroom house. It's nothing fancy, but it's mine, and I'm damn proud of it. I've been paying it off for ten years now, working day and night to make those mortgage payments. I won't deny that I sometimes envy my friends living in their fancy apartments downtown, but then I remember that this place is mine. No landlord breathing down my neck, and no roommates leaving dirty dishes in the sink. Just me and my space.

Now, let me introduce you to my sister, Holly. She's 38, a mother of two, and married to her high school sweetheart, Nicholas. We used to be close when we were younger, but things changed when she got married. She started focusing more on her new life, and I never blamed her. I believe she did what she thought was best for her. We drifted apart, but we were still on good terms. Or so I thought.

Holly and Nicholas have always been the free-spirited types. They're one of those people who're always talking about quitting the rat race and living life to the fullest. It used to drive me nuts when we'd get together for family dinners. ""Life's too short to be stuck in a cubicle, Phoebe"", Holly would say, sipping her wine. ""You should travel more, see the world!"". I'd roll my eyes, ""Some of us like having a steady paycheck and a roof over our heads, Holly"". Nicholas would chime in, ""But think of the experiences! The memories!"". Yeah, well, memories don't pay the bills, buddy, I'd think. I tried to tell them to be more careful with their money. They were always jetting off on last-minute trips or buying the latest gadgets, even with two young kids to think about. But did they listen? Nope.

A few months ago, they actually did it. They sold their house during the market boom, thinking they'd use the profit to fund a year-long break to ""travel the world"". I remember the conversation like it was yesterday. ""We're doing it, Phoebe!"" Holly squealed over the phone. ""We sold the house!"". ""What?"". I nearly choked on my coffee. ""Holly, are you serious? What about the kids' school? Your jobs?"". ""Oh, we'll homeschool them on the road. It'll be an education in itself! And we can always find work later. This is our chance to really live!"".

I tried to talk some sense into her. I was really worried. ""Holly, have you really thought this through? Travel is expensive, especially with kids. What happens when the money runs out?"". ""Don't be such a worrywart, Phoebe"", she said, brushing off the concerns. ""We've got it all figured out. We'll stay in hostels, maybe do some volunteering for room and board. It'll be fine!"".

It was not fine. Not at all. At first, their social media was full of pictures from nice hotels and fancy restaurants. ""Living the dream!"", they'd caption every post. But within two months, those posts started to dwindle. The last one I saw was a grainy shot of them camping in some field, with a caption about ""embracing the simple life"". Then, radio silence for a few weeks. I thought they were just busy enjoying their travels, unaware of what was really happening behind the scenes. One day, I came home from work, exhausted after a long day of meetings and deadlines. All I wanted was to kick off my shoes, pour a glass of wine, and binge-watch some trashy reality TV. But as soon as I opened my front door, I knew something was off.

There were shoes I didn't recognize in the entryway, kid-sized backpacks on the floor, and familiar voices coming from my living room. I walked in, and there they were. Holly, Nicholas, and their two kids. They were unpacking suitcases and boxes in MY living room. ""Holly?"", I blurted out, squinting my eyes as I looked at the mess in my living room. ""What... what are you doing here?"". ""Oh, hi Phoebe!"", Holly chirped. ""Surprise! We're back!"". ""Back?"", I repeated. ""In my house?"".

Then, Nicholas stepped forward, smiling like this was the most normal thing in the world. ""Yeah, we decided to cut the trip short"", he said. ""Turns out, full-time travel with kids is harder than we thought!"". ""And Mom gave us your spare key… the one you gave her for emergencies"", Holly added. ""I knew you wouldn't mind us crashing here for a bit while we figure things out. It'll only be for a few months"".

""A few months?"", I protested. ""Holly, are you serious? You can't just move into my house without asking me!"". ""But... we're family. I thought you'd be happy to help us out"". ""Happy?"", I could feel my cheeks burning with anger. ""Holly, this is my house. My space. You should've talked to me about this!"".

""Now, now, Phoebe"", Nicholas interrupted. ""Let's not get too high and mighty here. Family helps family, right? It's not like you're using all this space anyway"". I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Where did this entitlement come from? Why were they acting like what they did was fine?

""You guys need to leave"", I said, crossing my arms on my chest. ""Now"". But Holly refused. Meanwhile, Nicholas started subtly threatening me. ""Come on, Phoebe"", he began, looming over me. ""Don't make this difficult. We don't have anywhere else to go"". I was furious. If I called the cops, their young kids might get dragged into it, and I didn't want that. I needed to come up with a plan, so I headed straight to my bedroom and locked the door behind me.

At that point, I honestly felt like crying. I had no idea what to do until my phone buzzed. It was a text from my old college friend, Alex. Hey Pheebs! In your area for work. Drinks tonight?

Alex was always the prankster in our friend group, always coming up with wild schemes. If anyone could help me out of this mess, it was him. I quickly texted him back. Actually, can you come over? I have a situation and could use your help. Bring your acting skills. The doorbell rang an hour later, and I raced to answer it before Holly or Nicholas could. When I opened the door, I saw a police officer standing at my doorstep.

""Oh my God, Alex!"", I looked at him with wide eyes. ""You're wearing the perfect costume!"". I quickly stepped outside and closed the door behind me. ""What happened, Pheebs?"", he asked. ""I need your help getting rid of my relatives"", I told him, still fascinated by his fake police uniform. ""They've completely taken over my house"". I quickly explained the situation, and Alex agreed to help. Then, I opened the door and called out to Holly and Nicholas. ""Holly, Nicholas, can you come here please? There's a police officer who needs to speak with us"".

They were smiling when they came into the hallway, but their expressions immediately changed when they saw Alex in his uniform. ""Good evening"", Alex said. ""I'm Officer Johnson. We've received reports of a break-in at this address. Can you tell me what's going on here?"". Nicholas looked at me, squinting his eyes. Then, he puffed up his chest and slowly walked toward Alex. ""There's no break-in here, officer"", Nicholas said in a serious tone. ""We're family. Everything's fine"". ""Officer, these people entered my home unlawfully"", I said. ""I never gave them permission to be here"".

Alex nodded and then looked at Holly and Nicholas. ""How did you gain entry to this residence?"", Alex asked. ""We, uh, we used a key"", Holly stammered. ""Mom gave it to me. It was a, uh, spare key for emergencies"". ""But no one asked my permission"", I intervened. ""So, technically, you broke in. Who knows what might be missing?"". ""I see"", Alex said, looking around the house. ""And when the homeowner asked you to leave, did you comply?"". ""Now, hold on a minute"", Nicholas said, his voice trembling slightly. ""We did—"". ""I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave the premises immediately"", Alex cut him off, pulling out a pair of handcuffs. ""Failure to do so could result in charges of breaking and entering, as well as trespassing"".

I wanted to laugh so hard watching Nicholas pretending to be a police officer. He was just amazing. His last sentence was enough to send Holly and Nicholas into a panic. ""We're sorry…"", Holly began. ""We'll pack up"". They quickly began throwing their things into their bags. ""If you leave right now"", Alex said sternly, ""I won't file charges. But you'll return the key and never trespass again"".

They didn't need to be told twice. Alex and I watched in silence as they grabbed their kids and their bags and bolted out of the house. I finally laughed once their car sped away. ""You're a lifesaver, Alex"", I said, shaking my head in disbelief, ""Coffee?"". ""Sure!"", he said as he walked in and closed the door behind him. I quickly made two cups of coffee before we sat in my now-quiet living room. ""I can't believe they just assumed they could live here"", Alex said, shaking his head. ""I know"", I sighed. ""Part of me feels guilty, you know? They're family, after all. But I just couldn't let them freeload off me like that"".

""You did the right thing, Phoebe"", Alex reassured me. ""They can't just take advantage of you because their hare-brained scheme failed"". ""I'm so glad you messaged me at the right time, Alex"", I said, looking at my phone. ""I don't know what I'd have done without you. But why did you come dressed up like a police officer?"". ""Oh, that"", Alex chuckled, ""I was just messing around with friends, pulling pranks and all. I had no idea my costume would come in handy over here. What a coincidence, right?"".

""Yeah"", I nodded. ""What a coincidence"".

As we talked, I couldn't help but think of the consequences of my actions. Had I done the right thing? Would this drive an irreparable wedge between me and my sister? But then I looked around my living room. It was my space, and I had worked so hard for it. I thought about all the long hours and the sacrifices I'd made to buy a house and realized I couldn't let Holly and Nicholas just take over everything. I also realized it was okay to put myself first. It was okay to stand up for myself and not let people walk all over me.

1gq9lis,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1gq9lis/are_my_parents_emotionally_abusive/,Are my parents emotionally abusive?,"I'm 18 and still live with my parents and sister (16). The last couple of years both me and my sister have been struggling with our parents' rules and our relationship with them. I 'm not sure if this is normal and I'm overreacting or if this is not okay? Please help 😭

Both of my parents are very different. If I had to describe my dad in one word, it would be angry. He deals with a lot of stress from work and he takes it out on us at home. This looks like him 'snapping' all of a sudden over the littlest thing. You can't predict when or why this will happen and who his chosen victim is in that moment. He will raise his voice/yell and try to say things that he knows are shocking and hurtful. In the moment he will call us selfish or dumb or whatever else he can think of. As a child I would just take it and start crying, which would make him angrier. Now that I'm a teenager I try to defend myself, but he barely let's me speak while he rants. He is also a big know-it-all, disagreeing with him will result in him being angry and yelling again. As a child I was very aware of his mood. When he was happy, I could make jokes and talk to him. When he felt on edge, I would not speak or make jokes to him and I would do things like make him a coffee in the hopes that he would not snap. There have been multiple instances where my mom, sister and I are in my bedroom all crying because of him. I know he also has a very sweet side but lately I can't help but hate him.

My relationship with my mom is complicated. I hate her sometimes, just like my dad, but I also have a lot of love and understanding for her. She does at least try to be a good mom and she often is. She is however, very controlling. She has a lot of rules and wants things to go her way, at the expense of my freedom and my own responsibility. I have tried normal discussions with her, but she is very stubborn. There is no way to change her mind. Some examples: at 18 I still have a bedtime, I have to keep my phone downstairs at night, I am not allowed to cook/eat most things without permission (this includes simple things like an egg or a grilled cheese), at hangouts with friends I am always the first to leave because I have to be home a certain time, I can't wear certain things if she doesn't like it (too revealing/tacky in her opinion, even if it is trendy and everyone my age wears it), not allowed to use the upstairs when my dad is asleep (the upstairs includes my bedroom and our only bathroom. Also: when I am asleep she will loudly talk upstairs and wake me up). She also just generally gives us not a lot of privacy, when I'm in my room doing my own thing it's not unusual for her to check up on me every 30 minutes. Or when I'm getting ready for bed she will stand in my doorway while I change clothes and make sure I really am in bed with my phone downstairs and lights out. I just feel like I'm treated as a child.

They don't lay hands on me and at times they can also be very kind, supportive and like a friend. Help?

Hey I’m 23 guy and I was dating this girl for a year who’s our family friend and our dads are friends. 

She’s a very ambitious and smart girl and she was the only girlfriend I ever had. Everything was great in the beginning and it felt like a fantasy world being with her and we felt very much in love. After a while, differences come and I feel like things really started to be not as glowy. Now I have to admit that I struggle with mental health and porn addiction and because of that and the fact that I haven’t been able to deal with these issues. I underachieve most of the time and I get into these ruts. Basically I have zero consistency in my life and when I feel down or not as gloomy I sleep in until 3PM which causes a lot of problems in my personal life with my father as well, that’s a story for another time. Anyways, to cut it short I told my ex that I struggled with porn addiction and that when I was I got approached by cousin who’s 2 and half years older and he has been my childhood best friend to engage in some sexual stuff and that whole thing lead to an unpleasant fight between me and him that pretty much ruined our relationship. I was ashamed and upset that we did that and I felt very bad with myself and even to this day I feel like that negative experience defines me as a person and makes me hate myself. 

So my ex told me not to watch porn and that’s a deal breaker for her and well no surprise I watched porn again and she went mad and told me not to call and etc. That was the worst night of my life. I won’t get into too much detail but I cried for 3-4 days and I felt like i’m gonna have a heart attack the first night. I beg her to be with me and she said that she can’t trust me and that really started her to have that negative thought about me. She didn’t break up though and after that we started to have these fights on several things and we didn’t seem to agree on much. I was drained at times and I didn’t feel like I’m getting the respect and validation that I deserved. So close to the 1 year mark of the relationship, we get pretty more distant and she breaks up with me which I told her I don’t want to and want to make things work.

Funny enough, another girl who I have known her family and I’m her brother’s trainer (he has autism) asked me to grab coffee maybe 3 weeks after the break up. Now I know this girls family and it made me feel bad that this is happening in this period and I didn’t know what to think of it. I take this girl out and we go out 2 more times after that and she leaves because she studies abroad and I didn’t know exactly how the situation is because I felt like she’s not into me that much (she didn’t respond a lot and she said she wasn’t super down to go out). So she leaves and we text very very minimally. 

No surprise again, ex comes after 4 months and says she made a mistake and loves me and wants to be with me. She said she was going through something that I didn’t really know about. So we’ve been talking since then for like 2 months now and I really didn’t know what to do with the situation. I’m emotionally beat and I feel like I can’t make a good decision about it and either way I’m not gonna be happy. I really like the new girl, I mean they’re both great and ambitious and are academically achieved, which I’m not I just got into the same uni as my ex at 23, her influence pushed me to do that really. The new girl had texted me recently which didn’t do much of and initiated a convo when she’s back for a week. She comes back again in Christmas and she said she’ll see me then?

TLDR; first round of IVF only gave us 1 usable embryo and I’ve had a missed miscarriage at 7 weeks. Looking for help to feel hopeful for next time and any words of advice for the next round / what helped others to have success after similar experiences.

Hi all, I guess I’m hoping for some words of comfort, reassurance, hope and advice following a very painful experience of our first round of IVF

My (33f) husband and I (32f) are going through IVF as he has a genetic condition which is highly likely to lead to a severe and life-limiting condition in our child. We are in the UK and under a mix of private IVF care (referred via NHS) and NHS hospital care.

We had the ER earlier this year and they retrieved 34 eggs. I was really excited and thought we’d have lots of embryos to freeze. Only 7 made it to embryo stage and unfortunately 6 were affected by the genetic condition or chromosomal abnormalities. Our 1 usable embryo was a grade C.

During this time, I had quite bad OHSS and was admitted to hospital for 3 nights. I recovered well. 

Our 1 usable embryo was frozen until we were ready to transfer in the autumn. 

We had the embryo transfer which went really well. The embryologist said it looked really good upon transfer. 

I was confirmed pregnant which was the best news I’ve ever had (first pregnancy as we always knew about need for genetic screening and waited about 1.5 years to get to the top of the list). I really enjoyed being pregnant. I was so happy and content. I was very careful - taking all my medication and pregnancy vitamins, resting, eating a balanced diet and only drinking 1 cup of coffee per day (under the NHS guidance)

Very sadly and completely unexpectedly, at our 6 week scan we were told there was no heartbeat. Referred to NHS pregnancy clinic which confirmed a missed miscarriage between weeks 6 and 7. No reason why as the embryo was growing well and in the right place. It looks perfect, expect that it stopped developing. 

I had surgical management of the miscarriage yesterday and am getting lots of rest and care today. 

I have to wait 3 bleeds before starting stims again. Frustrating as I just want to start. 

I’ve been sent for further testing (eg for a blood clotting disorder, thyroid function, vit d)

I’m focusing on trying to get healthy for next time. Some things I’m thinking might help:

- Stopping caffeine altogether
- exercising more so I’m physically fitter (I’ve has a very difficult year so had fallen out of regular exercise)
- losing weight to get into the healthy BMI range (I was overweight - although not obese- at transfer. My weight crept up during stims and the stress of this year.)
- reducing stress (my job has been very stressful and I’ve been thinking of quitting anyway. I think this might be a sign to do it) 

I know that I probably couldn’t have done anything to prevent this miscarriage. But it gives me hope to think about anything I can do to improve the outcome next time.

I flip flop between ""I must have standards and adhere to them no matter what"" and ""yeah but life is often not clean cut and people are messy, that doesn't mean they're not decent"".

When I met my current boyfriend I was immediately turned off by the fact that I went to the bar and he didn't offer to buy me a drink.  We'd been talking about sunflowers and I had some spares, so I walked up to the bar and gave him a seedling I'd bought for him.  He just stood there awkwardly.  When we got talking though, I felt a connection to him and we got on really well.

After a few dates we went home together.  I very drunk, I hadn't done anything like this since I was like 20 (so 20 years!) and I'd been single 18 months after leaving an abuser.  I suppose part of me was like fk it.

I was really shocked that he didn't use protection....I felt too....embarassed I think? To say anything.  The next day, no offer of coffee, he simply said ""i'm going back to sleep"".   I left.  He offered to drive me but I said no and walked to my sisters nearby.

I knew i didn't feel ok with it.  I was confused.  Maybe i'd got it wrong.  Maybe i was just being ridiculous.

I continued seeing him.  He opens doors for me, he is respectful in the way he speaks to me, he's affectionate, there ARE positives that are in contrast to what i'd been through previously.  I appreciated it so much actually.  But things still nagged at me.

Why doesn't he care about my wellbeing regarding sexual health?  Why aren't I caring?  I eventually angrily confronted him about it.  His answers didn't really explain anything.  No idea why I was blaming him when I accepted it.

Why hasn't he taken me to dinner? Dated me properly?  Why am I not getting rid of this guy?  Why am I trying to put lipstick on a pig? Because he's nice and affectionate and I guess I feel like I just really appreciate those things? At what cost.

This guys lives at home with his mother, he's from Zimbabwe originally.  He's 39.  Every time he's with me his mother finds a job for him to do that has him rushing home.   He has a daughter that is a result of the same behaviour he's exhibited with me, he left that daughter in his home country after 5 years of ""trying to be part of her life"" and being rejected and told to give up parental rights by the mother.  So he came to the UK.

Instead of having standards and cutting this guy off, I've made excuses.  I've tried to take the route of appreciating what he DOES have rather than what he doesn't.  I've tried to take the route of thinking that life is complicated and real relationships aren't forged out of ""the 10 standards you must have with men"".

Months later, still no dinner date, and in fact, he took me to meet his friends and tried to drive me home drunk.

I honestly look at it all and think seriously what ARE you doing (to myself).  Why am I accepting this stuff.  Because he SAYS he's a good guy? Because he SAYS he wants a life? He can't even afford to support himself let alone have a life with anyone.   He seems to have settled into being a substitute husband for his mother.

Why are men like this? Why are they so INHERENTLY selfish.

My answer to this is argue, get upset, have fights, get offended, try to explain why his behaviour is unacceptable.   I literally KNOW at this point that it's completely pointless.   He is ""you just get upset from nothing"".  It isn't nothing, it's all the little things i'm noticing, can't reconcile and keep accepting.  It's my own stupid fault.  If I think about what YOU would like and how to make you happy, why aren't YOU doing the same? Why are YOU just trying to get as much as possible whilst giving as little as possible and giving me words words words about how decent you are.  

I know what i'm doing is stupid but I guess I just feel SO DAMN TIRED of trying NOT to subscribe to some set of protocols because I want people to actually just do the right thing.  Be decent.

I do not know what else to say.  The latest bust up is over womens rights and recent issues, because he sent me a Tiktok video to ""reassure me"" that there is no problem and I lost it with him and said ""perhaps if your daughter was raped and in this situation you would finally care"".  He's now making out i'm a vile person talking about his daughter being raped.  Like that's not the point.

I just think seriously why do you say you're this man, and then show me every which way that you aren't.  Why isn't it bothering you?  Why say you have respect when you clearly have none?

Why am I even getting into this with someone who clearly just has no standards and for goodness sake why haven't \*I\* got any standards and why do I think I can simply hope for the best with opportunistic immoral people.

**Incentives for Wise Spending:**

1. **The Golden Calculator Award**: Given annually to the department that managed to save the most taxpayers' money while still achieving their objectives. The prize? A golden calculator that's purely symbolic (because who needs another calculator in this digital age?).

2. **The Efficiency Trophy**: This would look great on any office shelf, and it comes with a year's supply of red tape cutters, symbolizing the department's ability to cut through bureaucracy.

3. **Budgeting Hero Medal**: For those who not only stick to their budget but also find creative ways to do more with less. The medal might also serve as a paperweight, keeping those reports in check.

**Consequences for Wasteful Spending:**

1. **The Budgetary Black Hole Certification**: Departments that consistently overspend or waste funds get this dubious honor. It's a plaque that reads, ""Here lies the budget, RIP, due to excessive waste.""

2. **The ""You're Busted"" Bus Tour**: For officials caught in wasteful spending, they might be paraded around in a bus with signs detailing their misdeeds, serving as a cautionary tale for others.

3. **The ""Spending Spree"" Timeout**: Instead of just a slap on the wrist, how about a literal time-out? A week in a room with nothing but a bean counter's nightmare - endless spreadsheets with no coffee or internet access.

1gq9hx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1gq9hx6/the_truth_about_social_anxiety_why_everything/,The Truth About Social Anxiety - Why Everything You've Tried Hasn't Worked (And How to Actually Transform It),"I want to share something powerful that will change how you see social anxiety forever.

After helping hundreds of people overcome their social fears and anxiety, I discovered something that most ""social skills advice"" completely misses.

Think about it - how many times have you:

* Been told to ""just be confident""
* Tried forcing yourself to be more social
* Practiced conversation ""techniques""
* Read endless tips about body language
* Pushed yourself out of your comfort zone

And yet... nothing really changed. Maybe you had moments of feeling better, but then fell right back into the same patterns.

Why?

Because all these methods focus on the OUTSIDE, when the real cause of social anxiety is on the INSIDE.

‎

# The Hidden Truth About Social Anxiety

The reality is - social anxiety isn't actually about ""lack of social skills"" or ""not knowing what to say.""

It's about RESISTANCE (wanting for things to be different than the way they are).

Your brain is designed to protect you from pain and danger. And it does this based on what it has learned through past experiences (your beliefs and memories).

Think back to your early experiences:

* That time you said something ""wrong"" and everyone laughed
* When you felt rejected or excluded
* Times you were judged or criticized
* Moments you felt ""not good enough""

Each of these experiences created a memory in your subconscious mind. A belief about what social situations mean.

Now, years later... whenever you're in a social situation, your mind remembers all those painful associations. And begins to create anxiety to protect you from potential pain.

This is why you:

* Overthink what to say
* Worry about being judged
* Feel your mind going blank
* Get physical anxiety symptoms
* Avoid social situations

Your mind is trying to move you away from what it perceives as danger.

‎

# Why Most Social Advice Fails

Most social skills advice completely misses this crucial point.

They tell you to:

* Practice small talk
* Use eye contact
* Work on body language
* Push through the fear
* Use conversation techniques

But here's the problem - if you have limiting beliefs about social situations being painful or dangerous... your subconscious mind will ALWAYS create resistance.

It's like trying to drive with the handbrake on. You can push the gas pedal harder (force yourself to be social), but you'll never drive smoothly until you release the brake (change the limiting beliefs).

‎

# The Real Solution: Transforming Your Beliefs

I've helped hundreds of people completely transform their social anxiety by addressing the root cause - their limiting beliefs.

One of my students had such severe anxiety he couldn't even order coffee. After we changed his limiting beliefs around social situations... within 30 days he was comfortably speaking in meetings, connecting with new people, even giving presentations.

The key is understanding that you have limiting beliefs about:

* Not being good enough
* Being judged
* Making mistakes
* Speaking up not being safe
* Not belonging
* Being different/weird

These beliefs create your social anxiety... influence your thoughts... drive your emotions... and determine your actions.

‎

# How Beliefs Control Everything

Your beliefs shape:

1. Your Perceptions

* How you interpret social situations
* What you notice about others' reactions
* How you think others see you

1. Your Emotions

* Anxiety levels in social situations
* How comfortable you feel expressing yourself
* Your emotional reactions to others

1. Your Actions

* What you say and do
* How naturally you express yourself
* Whether you avoid or engage socially

1. Your Results

* The connections you create
* How others respond to you
* Your social experiences

‎

# The Process of Transformation

Here's the step-by-step process to permanently transform social anxiety:

1. Identify Your Limiting Beliefs

* Notice what thoughts come up in social situations
* What do you fear might happen?
* What painful memories come to mind?
* What do you believe about yourself socially?

1. Find Evidence Against These Beliefs

* Look for times you were social without anxiety
* Moments you connected easily with others
* Times you expressed yourself naturally
* Situations where you felt comfortable

1. Create New Evidence Daily

* Focus on positive social experiences
* Notice when interactions go well
* Collect proof that contradicts old beliefs
* Build new positive associations

1. Reinforce for 21-30 Days

* Review your evidence daily
* Keep collecting new positive proof
* Let your mind build new neural pathways
* Allow the old beliefs to fade

‎

# What Actually Changes

When you transform these limiting beliefs, something amazing happens:

* Words flow naturally without overthinking
* You stop worrying about judgment
* Physical anxiety symptoms disappear
* You feel free to be yourself
* Others respond to you differently
* Social situations become enjoyable

Why? Because you've removed the invisible barriers in your mind.

You're no longer fighting against subconscious resistance. You're aligned - wanting to connect AND feeling safe to do so.

‎

# The Social Skills Part

Once you've changed those limiting beliefs, certain social skills become natural:

1. Authentic Expression

* Say what you actually think
* Share how you really feel
* Express your genuine opinions
* Be comfortable with your personality

1. Natural Connection

* Listen without anxiety
* Respond spontaneously
* Share relevant experiences
* Build on conversations naturally

1. Confident Presence

* Maintain comfortable eye contact
* Speak with natural volume
* Have relaxed body language
* Take up appropriate space

These aren't ""techniques"" you have to practice. They flow naturally when you're not fighting against limiting beliefs.

‎

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Don't try to ""fake it till you make it""

* This creates more internal conflict
* Your subconscious mind knows it's fake
* Others can sense the incongruence

1. Don't force yourself to be more social

* This reinforces that it's not natural
* Creates more resistance
* Builds negative associations

1. Don't judge yourself for having anxiety

* This creates more limiting beliefs
* Adds another layer of resistance
* Makes transformation harder

‎

# The Path Forward

The reality is - you were born socially free. Watch any child... they express themselves naturally without fear.

Your social anxiety came from experiences that created limiting beliefs. Change those beliefs... and you return to your natural state of social freedom.

Remember - you're not broken and you don't lack social skills. You just have some old programming that needs to be updated.

When you transform those limiting beliefs, everything else falls into place naturally.",3,1731491869.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

Yesterday morning, as I was preparing for the day, I was approached by a man claiming to work for the local council. He showed me id consisting of photo id, and surprisingly a badge. I only glanced at it. He then pointed out a trickle of liquid coming from the nearby verge, across the path, claiming it was urine.I told him that I use a bottle and dispose of it responsibily by pouring it down the drain.
This was the wrong answer, and he issued me a £100 fine for ""littering -urine"". I couldn't argue as he'd already pointed out his body cam so I took it, paid it immediately and went on with my day.

This morning, I was parked in a different location within the same area, and what I assume was the same man (it was still dark) approached me again. (He did not identify himself on this occasion)I was ready and immediately showed him the still full bottle of urine that I planned to dispose down a toilet at my 1st chance.

He changed tactic and pointed out a small patch of milky liquid by my front tyre.
""What's that?"" Me not thinking blurt ""coffee""  this was the wrong answer ""you can't do that"" he said. He went on to admonish me for be irresponsible, this is while we're in a layby strewn with litter.
This irritated me and I admit I swore (bare in mind I was still sitting in my truck and he was standing approx 5ft away) 

He then demanded my driver's license so he could issue another fine. I was in full fury now and said no! As he started to say ""this is what's going to happen -"" I said ""I'm going"" I put the truck in gear and pulled away, leaving him behind.

I've cooled down now, and I'm worried I've made a big mistake. Other less reliable sources seem to think a council officer has little to no power, but I don't know.
I could really use some advice on what (if anything) to do next

Hey I’m 23 guy and I was dating this girl for a year who’s our family friend and our dads are friends. 

She’s a very ambitious and smart girl and she was the only girlfriend I ever had. Everything was great in the beginning and it felt like a fantasy world being with her and we felt very much in love. After a while, differences come and I feel like things really started to be not as glowy. Now I have to admit that I struggle with mental health and porn addiction and because of that and the fact that I haven’t been able to deal with these issues. I underachieve most of the time and I get into these ruts. Basically I have zero consistency in my life and when I feel down or not as gloomy I sleep in until 3PM which causes a lot of problems in my personal life with my father as well, that’s a story for another time. Anyways, to cut it short I told my ex that I struggled with porn addiction and that when I was I got approached by cousin who’s 2 and half years older and he has been my childhood best friend to engage in some sexual stuff and that whole thing lead to an unpleasant fight between me and him that pretty much ruined our relationship. I was ashamed and upset that we did that and I felt very bad with myself and even to this day I feel like that negative experience defines me as a person and makes me hate myself. 

So my ex told me not to watch porn and that’s a deal breaker for her and well no surprise I watched porn again and she went mad and told me not to call and etc. That was the worst night of my life. I won’t get into too much detail but I cried for 3-4 days and I felt like i’m gonna have a heart attack the first night. I beg her to be with me and she said that she can’t trust me and that really started her to have that negative thought about me. She didn’t break up though and after that we started to have these fights on several things and we didn’t seem to agree on much. I was drained at times and I didn’t feel like I’m getting the respect and validation that I deserved. So close to the 1 year mark of the relationship, we get pretty more distant and she breaks up with me which I told her I don’t want to and want to make things work.

Funny enough, another girl who I have known her family and I’m her brother’s trainer (he has autism) asked me to grab coffee maybe 3 weeks after the break up. Now I know this girls family and it made me feel bad that this is happening in this period and I didn’t know what to think of it. I take this girl out and we go out 2 more times after that and she leaves because she studies abroad and I didn’t know exactly how the situation is because I felt like she’s not into me that much (she didn’t respond a lot and she said she wasn’t super down to go out). So she leaves and we text very very minimally. 

No surprise again, ex comes after 4 months and says she made a mistake and loves me and wants to be with me. She said she was going through something that I didn’t really know about. So we’ve been talking since then for like 2 months now and I really didn’t know what to do with the situation. I’m emotionally beat and I feel like I can’t make a good decision about it and either way I’m not gonna be happy. I really like the new girl, I mean they’re both great and ambitious and are academically achieved, which I’m not I just got into the same uni as my ex at 23, her influence pushed me to do that really. The new girl had texted me recently which didn’t do much of and initiated a convo when she’s back for a week. She comes back again in Christmas and she said she’ll see me then?

The catalyst for my quitting was my 6 month review. However, I have disability issues and my SM wasn't helpful with accomadations. I stuck it out longer than I should have to the detriment of my physical health.

On the same day I had my review I sold out all the cafe books (The $5 books we sell at the cafe register with cafe purchase) in edtion to signing up 3 reward members. Selling books, getting sign-ups, making coffee, the day was going well.

Queue the review: The review my SM gave me was less than satisfactory. I don't have a good sell record on the sales floor (I'm a barista and am rarely on the floor) and I had been texting people to cover my shift the night before and I was told my co-workers were unhappy with me (Untrue). 

There's a new store opening and all the senior people are leaving and I was hoping for a senior batista position. I was told just because there would be no senior baristas doesnt mean someone else gets to aitomatically move up. 

So I decided to quit. The job got too hard physically. Also it was mentally taxing knowing I had survived a traumatic accident had relearned to walk and some Michael Scott tells me I need to work harder after busting my ass. Like, get fucked, bitch.


There's a man that's been working at that location for 30 years. THIRTY years. And all he got was a tray of cupcakes from the local grocery store. Fuck any company that is alright with that.  

They think I guy is trying to smuggle did into prison using the store's books.

SM was caught embezzling at her last job.

I met my partner while working their and I want to marry them. 




I really enjoyed working there and aside from the SM, there were some amazing people. Truly outstanding and I really value the time I had there and the people I got to work with. I wish things had gone differently because yeah, it's hard to find a place where you feel really comfortable being yourself and youre accepted for it but also having a sense of belonging is really important.  But companies can and will take advantage of that. I was lucky enough to be a cripple before that could happen.

I quit. Manager is a thief. I worked with amazing people and I miss them.

Hey fellow Redditors! Derek here, aka u/solopassions, diving headfirst into the world of solo travel and loving every thrilling, occasionally awkward, insanely rewarding minute of it! If you've ever hesitated about wandering the world alone, let me assure you – it’s exactly the wild ride you didn’t know you were craving.

**Unique Experiences? Oh boy, Where Do I Start?**

Imagine this: getting lost in the labyrinthine streets of Venice, serenaded by an accidental opera performance echoing through the canals. Or, kayaking solo on New Zealand's glittering Milford Sound, feeling like the star of your own action-adventure movie, complete with dramatic mountain backdrops and a sidekick seal! Solo travel is the ultimate opportunity to embrace the unexpected. Sometimes, you find yourself at a local festival, inexplicably crowned “Honorary Guest” (true story!).

**Solo Travel: A Crash Course in Personal Growth**

Solo adventuring isn’t just a journey through exotic locales; it’s a deep dive into self-discovery. You learn to trust your instincts when Google Maps insists you’re swimming across a highway. You'll tap into problem-solving skills navigating language barriers with an uncanny mix of charades and enthusiastic (if confusing) gestures. Who knew ordering a simple coffee could require interpretive dance?

The transformation is real – suddenly, things like dining alone in a bustling Parisian café or hitching a ride up a remote Scottish cliffside become second nature. It’s like leveling up in the game of life, gaining new confidence, resilience, and an uncanny ability to pack a suitcase like a ninja.

**Considering a Solo Trip? Here’s My Sage Advice:**

1. **Be Fearlessly Curious:** Say yes to new experiences, even if they sound a smidge crazy (within safe limits!). That’s how you end up sharing a houseboat dinner with a fisherman’s family in Kerala, realizing smiles and nods can bridge any language gap.

2. **Plan…ish:** Embrace the unknown, but keep some essentials sorted (paging Dr. Disorganized Traveler!). This way, even when you’re “accidentally” spending the night in a train station, you’ve got snacks and a playlist to see you through.

3. **Connect with Locals:** Whether it’s a friendly chat with a street vendor or joining a spontaneous volleyball game, locals offer the best travel tips. Just don’t challenge a tuk-tuk driver to a race unless you’re prepared to lose spectacularly.

4. **Document the Quirky Moments:** Snap pics or jot down entries in a journal. Trust me, future-you will be utterly entertained by past-you’s escapades, especially the “lost in translation” menu mishaps!

So, to all wandering spirits or those considering dipping a toe into the vast ocean of solo travel, take a leap! As u/solopassions, I can assure you—your future stories, perspective shifts, and self-discoveries are worth every moment of awkward, lonely, and downright epic self-navigating fun. 🌍✨

1gq95fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1gq95fo/split_between_ex_and_a_new_girl/,Split between Ex and a new girl,"Hey I’m 23 guy and I was dating this girl for a year who’s our family friend and our dads are friends. 

She’s a very ambitious and smart girl and she was the only girlfriend I ever had. Everything was great in the beginning and it felt like a fantasy world being with her and we felt very much in love. After a while, differences come and I feel like things really started to be not as glowy. Now I have to admit that I struggle with mental health and porn addiction and because of that and the fact that I haven’t been able to deal with these issues. I underachieve most of the time and I get into these ruts. Basically I have zero consistency in my life and when I feel down or not as gloomy I sleep in until 3PM which causes a lot of problems in my personal life with my father as well, that’s a story for another time. Anyways, to cut it short I told my ex that I struggled with porn addiction and that when I was I got approached by cousin who’s 2 and half years older and he has been my childhood best friend to engage in some sexual stuff and that whole thing lead to an unpleasant fight between me and him that pretty much ruined our relationship. I was ashamed and upset that we did that and I felt very bad with myself and even to this day I feel like that negative experience defines me as a person and makes me hate myself. 

So my ex told me not to watch porn and that’s a deal breaker for her and well no surprise I watched porn again and she went mad and told me not to call and etc. That was the worst night of my life. I won’t get into too much detail but I cried for 3-4 days and I felt like i’m gonna have a heart attack the first night. I beg her to be with me and she said that she can’t trust me and that really started her to have that negative thought about me. She didn’t break up though and after that we started to have these fights on several things and we didn’t seem to agree on much. I was drained at times and I didn’t feel like I’m getting the respect and validation that I deserved. So close to the 1 year mark of the relationship, we get pretty more distant and she breaks up with me which I told her I don’t want to and want to make things work.

Funny enough, another girl who I have known her family and I’m her brother’s trainer (he has autism) asked me to grab coffee maybe 3 weeks after the break up. Now I know this girls family and it made me feel bad that this is happening in this period and I didn’t know what to think of it. I take this girl out and we go out 2 more times after that and she leaves because she studies abroad and I didn’t know exactly how the situation is because I felt like she’s not into me that much (she didn’t respond a lot and she said she wasn’t super down to go out). So she leaves and we text very very minimally. 

No surprise again, ex comes after 4 months and says she made a mistake and loves me and wants to be with me. She said she was going through something that I didn’t really know about. So we’ve been talking since then for like 2 months now and I really didn’t know what to do with the situation. I’m emotionally beat and I feel like I can’t make a good decision about it and either way I’m not gonna be happy. I really like the new girl, I mean they’re both great and ambitious and are academically achieved, which I’m not I just got into the same uni as my ex at 23, her influence pushed me to do that really. The new girl had texted me recently which didn’t do much of and initiated a convo when she’s back for a week. She comes back again in Christmas and she said she’ll see me then?

Me and my boyfriend have been together over 6 years. We were very close friends before getting together. For 6 years I thought he was great. He had flaws of course like being messy and smoking weed all the time but he was the most loving and fun person. Our relationship was dreamy. We were best friends, had so much laugh and fun together, lots of passion and great sex, travelled together, loved to eat and cook, got a dog and made a lovely home together. Everything was right and we both knew we’d spend the rest of our lives together.

Then something shocking happened. He was going through some problems with money that was on his mind a lot and i started feeling neglected around the same time as he was dealing with it but also started to party a bit more. We had a big fight as i felt like he likes to party too much and i was also feeling neglected. We made up and things seemed okay. Until one day we had a big fight because he went to party and i had a gut feeling so went through his phone.. that changed my whole life.
I found messages with this girl. Someone he went to school with when he was younger. It was mainly casual catching up but some of it flirty (things like “i bet i can cook better than you, when are you gonna cook for me) it was never sexual or romantic. They also tried to meet up a few times to walk the dogs or get coffee. Anyway, i woke him up and he cried (first time i’ve ever seen him cry) messaged her saying he made a big mistake talking to her and blocked her. Then he lied saying they only talked for a few weeks, she’s an old friend, they never did anything.. few days later he confessed that he slept with her a few times when he was 16-17 but he treated her very badly, he only used her for sex and made her leave right after. He never cared for her and told her she’d never be his girlfriend etc and they didn’t talk for like 7 years until now.
I talked to her on the phone, she said nothing happened and the convo was mostly casual with a bit of flirting. It lasted 3 months! Sometimes it would be one response a day, sometimes they wouldn’t talk for days. 95% was plain chat and the most flirting was about cooking or trying to meet up. They never did meet up and he said he didn’t actually want to see her, otherwise he’d try harder if he really wanted to. He said he talked to her because it made him feel good. He was going through the money problems plus we were arguing. It made him forget about it for a sec, it was never about her but the way it made him feel. I guess a bit of ego boost. He also felt like i was being controling because i wouldn’t let him go out and party and stuff. I guess that was true but for some reason i was scared he’d be looking at women.. he’d normally party with me and rarely go without me.
Anyway, two weeks later I found out he’s been watching porn for years and years. I wouldn’t care about that but when i asked him through the years if he ever watches porn, he said no each time. Why to lie ? I get it’s private and personal but no need to lie. Even worse, he had reddit account and watched naked women and he was also paying to only fans. When i asked him about it, he lied at first. Lies lies lies all the time. When i told him I know it, he said he’s embarrassed and it’s private. He said he’s been doing it since he was a teenager and it was a habit, a quick wank. He said that he took it too far like paying for only fans and maybe he didn’t realise he’s got a problem but now he stopped watching it (it’s been over a month) and says he feels much better and his head is clearer and he doesn’t want to look at that stuff again.
AND NOW THE WORST. He said he never physically cheated. He’s been telling me for years that he’s never done it and that he would never do it. 
Couple weeks after i found out about the girl, it’s like he started to realise he’s loosing me and he’s been breaking down. Crying, regretting everything. One day i had a feeling that there’s more. So i kept asking him, i begged him to tell me if he ever cheated. And at first he was like no but i could see in his eyes that he’s lying. Then he said he kissed someone at the beginning of us seeing each other. I was devasted and cried for hours. Then i got another gut feeling that more happened. So i told him again that i can feel it and i know there’s more. And he finally confessed that he slept with the girl he kissed.
It was like a bullet. I couldn’t believe it. He said he can’t exactly remember when it happened because it’s so long ago but he said he thinks it was at the start before we got official. 
Just so you understand- we started as friends with benefits. I was in love with someone else and I told him because i wanted to be transparent with him. He knew but still wanted to spend time with me. After 2-3 months he took my virginity and things were getting more serious but we still weren’t a couple. We would travel together and start seeing each other more (i think he cheated around that time). And then few months later we got official. 
He said they were drunk, she came on him and he didn’t want it at first but acted out on impulses, he also felt like i wasn’t 100% serious about him because I liked the other guy. He said it didn’t feel good and he stopped after a few seconds and told her he has a gf that he loves and kicked her out. He said he felt guilty and horrible but decided to bury it and never tell anyone because he was so scared of losing me forever. We weren’t serious and he was scared i’d just stop seeing him and i already meant a lot to him at the point even tho he messed up. He’s willing to try and find the girl so she can confirm when the cheating happened and also that he stopped and kicked her out.
I think that is all. I believe he never cheated again after that, I can tell when looking in his eyes now. We’ve also been living together for years and spend 24/7 together pretty much so it wouldnt really be possible. He said he can take a lie detector and been swearing on his life that was the only time.

What is your opinion on this? I know you’re reading this thinking GIRL LEAVE HIM. But I know he really loves me, even tho he hurt me. He’s been having break downs, crying and shaking in the middle of the night. He’s not been eating. He’s been drinking and his mental health has been bad. He really doesn’t want to lose me. He wants to go to therapy to find out why he did those things and why he lied to me, he wants to do couple therapy, he wants to stop smoking weed and change his life and be a better person for himself and for me if i’ll ever have him again. He wants me to be happy and doesn’t pressure me to stay with him, he said he will forever try to get me back because i’m the love of his life and he loves me more than anything. He knows he messed up and takes full accountability, he’s even willing to find the girl and have the uncomfortable chat so she can speak to me. 
I know he loves me by the way he looks at me and holds me. There’s so much emotion and love. He’s got a good heart but made very bad choices. I believe you can love someone deeply but still be selfish and hurt them because you have deeper issues. And he wants to work on these issues now. It sucks he had to hurt me to realise life is not just about him but others too. I know i could be with someone who would treat me right with respect but I spent 6 years with him and we don’t know adult life without each other. We had such a great life. I loved him, our home, his family.. everything.
What makes it worse is that I live at his place and have no family or anywhere else to stay. 
I’m torn because I want to stay with him and help him to be better and create a great life because our connection is so special and you don’t find that everywhere but also I don’t want people to treat me badly and spend my life question everything he does. Anyone been in a similar situation? I want to give him a second chance to prove himself but I’m scared because as i said, i don’t trust my own judgement anymore. Do i stick by him with the risk that he will never change and i’ll get hurt again or shall I leave but potentially giving up on someone who i love deeply and who could be the partner i deserve with a lot of work.. He said seeing me this broken traumatised him and he would never ever do it to me or us again. He said he would have to be evil to put me through it again.

A friend and I will be in London for one day together (first week of December), and we’re hoping to visit some Christmas markets. We’re meeting up with others for lunch around 12:30 near Fortnum & Mason. Based on my research, I thought we could start with Covent Garden, then Leicester Square, and end up at Fortnum & Mason. Are there any must-sees or hidden gems along this route that we might be missing?

I’ve heard mixed reviews about Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, especially because there’s an entry fee, and we’re hoping to save our £s for food and fun experiences rather than entry costs. So if you know of any alternative markets or events worth checking out, I’d love to hear!

We’d also love a coffee shop recommendation to kick off our day—ideally somewhere cozy for a coffee and pastry at the start of our day. 

I’ll be in London for a few days (staying in SW London along the Northern Line), so if there are other Christmas markets or festive spots worth visiting, please let me know. I’m heading back to the southern hemisphere (where Christmas means beaches!), so I’m hoping to soak up as much of the winter magic as possible.

I've got some exciting news to share – I just found an incredible Black Friday deal on Levi's Overalls that you absolutely need to check it out now. As someone who practically lives in their Levi's, I couldn't resist snagging another pair at this amazing price.

I've been wearing Levi's Overalls for years, and let me tell you, they're a game-changer in my wardrobe. The moment I slip them on, I feel like I'm wrapped in a cocoon of comfort and style. The denim is soft yet durable, molding to my body with each wear. Whether I'm running errands, meeting friends for coffee, or even dressing them up for a casual night out, these overalls are my go-to outfit.

What I love most about Levi's Overalls is their versatility. I own a pair in dark wash, and it's incredible how many different looks I can create. In the summer, I pair them with a cropped tee and sandals for a laid-back vibe. When the weather cools down, I layer them over a turtleneck with ankle boots for a chic, autumnal ensemble. The adjustable straps ensure a perfect fit every time, and the multiple pockets are perfect for keeping my essentials close at hand.

The quality of Levi's denim is unmatched. My current pair has been through countless washes and adventures, yet they still look amazing. The fabric has softened beautifully over time without losing its shape or color. It's this durability that makes me confident in investing in another pair – I know they'll last for years to come.

With this Black Friday deal, I'm eyeing the Baggy Highwater Women's Overalls in medium wash. The relaxed fit is perfect for my casual lifestyle, and the slightly cropped leg will be great for showing off my favorite sneakers or boots. I can already imagine how I'll style them for different occasions.

If you've been considering adding a pair of overalls to your wardrobe, or if you're already a fan like me, this deal is too good to pass up. Levi's overalls are a timeless classic that never go out of style, and at this price, they're an absolute steal.

Remember, Black Friday deals don't last forever, so if you're interested, don't wait too long. These overalls have been a staple in my wardrobe, and I'm thrilled to add another pair to my collection. Happy shopping, everyone!",1,1731489260.0,SavvyFridays,1,1.0,False

I just recieved note, that my shop has given me the option to get a refund on the oracle touch. recently i returned the mazzer philos because of issues aswell, with both clogging and shot timings being of the charts.

So i have some budget available to get a good grinder and espresso machine.  
Both Breville/Sage dual boilers, and Mazzer philos are not an option.

I was looking to get the Lagom P64 with ssp HU burrs. and a good espresso machine to go with that.

I always make sets of 2 cappuchino at a time, 2 or 3 times a day(so 4-6 a day). Both espresso and frothing milk need to be a good experience. i dont mind it takes sometime, but warmup time is my biggest complaint. I dont like to have to wait 20+ min for it to get temperature stable.

So far i have narrowed the search to,  
Ascaso steel Duo Plus, 2100€  
Lelit Bianca V3, 2000€  
Decent pro, 3300€  
Second hand la marzocco Mini, 3300,-

(i work in IT, data specificly, so i have no issues with having computer related problems). the realtime data is something i would enjoy using to improve the process.

la marzocco is a bit expensive because of taxes. Secondhand might be an option, but im not sure what would be reasonable, and how to spot poorly maintained machines.

It just sort of happens.

In my case, for as long as I can remember, I was always shy. Over-sensitive. Anxious. Bad at eye contact. Bad at socializing. Bad at laughing at the punchline—it was always the setup that got me. Not-so-good at sports, no real tangible skills in general, *okay* at video games.

Not really what you’d call a winning recipe.

Now twenty-six years into my journey on this frozen fireball, I was friendless. Girlfriendless. Prospectless, certainly, when it came to things like having a ‘career’ or ‘real, meaningful hobbies’. I was trapped in a dopamine loop of sleeping in, sugary cereal featuring a certain famous sea captain, “looking for a job”—for like five minutes, video games, hating myself, more video games, more cereal, scrolling on my phone until I passed out, rinse and repeat.

My parents, constantly jutting back and forth between easing off the pressure—hoping it would give me space to improve, or insane, *Finding Nemo* levels of helicopter parenting—hoping it would give me the stress to improve, had opted for a new strategy now.

Therapy.

I had to attend four sessions, or I would be kicked out of the house.

Oof.

On the list of “things I never ever want to do,” spilling my secrets and insecurities out to a complete stranger ranked pretty damn high. Interestingly though, *living on the street with no safety net* ranked even higher! I wanted to believe that this was yet another empty threat from the perpetual paper tiger couple that was Momma and Dadda, but they were serious. *Filled out most of the intake forms themselves and paid for four sessions in advance*—serious.

Begrudgingly, I added my e-signature and clicked ‘submit’ on the page they’d opened for me. I was going to therapy.

And so there I was, sat across from Riley, my parent-approved counselor who supposedly specialized in *trauma therapy*, *mindfulness*, and something called *EMDR* (which I Googled and still didn’t quite understand). She looked… frazzled. Tired. I watched her hand move in uneven, hurried strokes across a piece of paper—she’d started the session by apologizing and asking for two minutes—as I recalled the cursory online search I did about her in the days leading up to the session.

She was quite new to this. Freshly graduated, recently moved to the city, and *just* signed on with this practice a few months ago. Her rates were cheaper than most—my folks’ rationale in choosing her becoming ever more apparent.

I wasn’t sure if her being green was a good or bad thing when it came to this whole operation. Maybe she wouldn’t know *what* to do with a headcase like me, and I’d be able to skirt by these sessions on a technicality. We could both just sit in silence together—no word-vomiting for hours about my mommy issues required.

She folded the piece of paper twice, pocketed it, then shifted her full attention—posture, eyes, soul—towards me.

“Hi Elijah,” she said.

“Hi,” I said back.

“It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today.”

“Of course, and uh, thank you… for… taking the time?”

*Jeez. Ten seconds into chatting and I was already crumbling.*

“How has your week been so far?” she asked.

“Uhh, good? I think. Yeah! Good. Fine. *Decent.*”

“I’m glad to hear that.”

“Yeah,” I said, with a chuckle for some reason, before deciding to look down at the rug which felt the right thing to do.

*How the fuck do people talk outside of Discord, again?*

“If I may ask, is this your first time working with a counselor?”

I was now in a full-on staring contest with the ground. “Yeah—first time.”

She let the silence linger. Dear God, the cruelty of it all. Did this monster not realize I had no idea how to carry a conversation?

After two eternities—or what lesser humans would call “three minutes give or take”—I lifted my eyes back to reach hers.

“It’s okay if you’re nervous,” she said. “Therapy can be a *lot.*”

“Yeah no, sorry, it’s… my parents, they uh, really wanted me to come here. And I’m uh here now, hah. I think—I think that they’re just, uh, worried about me. And I guess I get it?”

“You guess you get it. Can you explain more about what you mean by that?”

“Yeah, I mean, cause they don’t say it with these words but they probably think I’m a… waste of space, I guess. ‘Cause I am. I mean, I take up space. I’m like, that dude from *The Metamorphosis*, who turns into a bug, but with like, less shame. Like I just play video games all day, then sort of like hate myself for it, but then continue doing it, and just yeah—don’t really, have, ambitions I guess, I think ‘cause I’ve hated every job I’ve ever had, so like—*hard to want a job after that right?* Hah but uh yeah, I’m, I don’t know, I’m not stoked on myself either so I get it but I also don’t know how to help it cause if I could’ve helped it obviously *I would’ve solved it by now, you know*—”

And Jesus Christ. I’d just opened the sewer gates and let metric tons of industrial sludge pour into the room.

“Sorry,” I said.

“Don’t be,” she said reassuringly. “It sounds like you’re going through a lot. Like you’re dealing with a lot of different, conflicting feelings within yourself. Which, believe it or not, is actually quite normal.” She paused, took a deep breath, and then continued. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to start by saying two very simple things.”

“Sure.”

“First, we have plenty of time together, so don’t worry too much about *getting things right*. About… getting the words out perfectly, and rushing through your thoughts so you don’t forget anything. This is a space where you are welcome, encouraged even, to take your time to work through things.”

“Right, so if I’m hearing you correctly, I *don’t* have to talk like an auctioneer?”

Holy crap—she actually laughed! Sure she was getting paid to be nice to me, but still! When the hell do I ever crack jokes?

“Second…” she said, and deep down I hoped and prayed that she’d say something mundane and forgettable because it’s not every day—or ever, actually—that I sit across from someone and have them actually care about what I say, this particular revelation bringing me concern that I was probably much more prone to liking this woman than the average person—“I can tell, from just a couple minutes of talking to you, that you seem like a decent guy. A decent guy who’s maybe just being a little hard on himself.”

*Goddamnit. And now, I think I might actually like you.* Maybe I do need therapy.

“And by the way, it’s Gregor Samsa.”

“Sorry?”

“The name of the guy from The Metamorphosis?” she said. “By Kafka? It’s Gregor Samsa.”

“Ah. Right.”

*Yep. I like you.*

The rest of the sixty-minute session consisted of probing questions, me opening up (see: rambling) about next to everything, and gaining a sense of just how deep my emotional trauma rabbit hole went. All the while, she listened fully, taking notes, smiling, nodding. I felt a cosmic thread between us.

I felt it after the session, too. A weight.

It was as if some room had opened up in my chest. A pile of emotional clutter, confusion and sensations I couldn’t put words to had cleared out, making space for something else.

But what exactly that something else was—I couldn’t quite put a finger on.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My new favorite person wanted to go a bit deeper with session 2.

If session 1 was “Let me get to know you,” 2 was “No, really, get to know *you.*”

She steered us through the chit-chat of how the week went—the usual niceties—grounding us in the room for this meeting *I didn’t want to admit I’d been waiting all week for.*

“Now, with your permission,” she said, “I want you to take a moment to think about the biggest blocker in your life right now. It could be something external; situational. It could be a feeling that you have about yourself. Or a memory. Maybe, something from your past. Take a minute, and let me know when you’ve found it.”

Okay, *here goes nothing…*

I thought long and hard about the giant list of negatives that comprised my miserable little life. All of them, in their own ways, jutting compelling knives of anxiety into my throat, my chest, my arms—

But there was a throughline, within all of them.

“My biggest blocker is that I think that everyone hates me.”

She wrote it down, mouthed it as she did. “You think…” *scribble scribble* “that everyone…” *scribble* “hates you...”

“Yeah, but not just *think*. It feels like it’s been reinforced, through the, I don’t know, things people have said, or ways they’ve acted around me. Like, it’s not just *me*.”

“I understand,” she said, leaning forward as if my state had given her a spark of inspiration. “What I’d like you to do next, if you’re comfortable, is to close your eyes.”

I complied.

Behind my shut lids, a kaleidoscope of blurred shapes, dots, and splatters started to take form on an otherwise dark canvas.

“I want you to imagine that this thought, feeling, or *concrete belief formed out of a series of life events*—‘Everyone hates me.’—I want you to imagine that it has a name, a voice, and a presence in your mind.”

“Alright.”

“Let me know when you’ve done that.”

“Yep, I’m there,” I said. Wasn’t too difficult. My self-hatred makes up *most of me,* anyways.

“Great. Now, I’d like you to imagine that there’s a microphone in your mind, and all of these disparate parts of you—anxiety, jealousy, fervor, happiness, fear, love,”—yeesh, she really emphasized that last one—“they all have access to this microphone, but only you get to decide who holds it.”

“Okay…”

“And now I’d like you to give the microphone to the part of you that thinks you’re unlikeable.”

“And then…?”

“And then I’m gonna ask you to let it speak.”

And so, I did. And over the next thirty minutes, I let the part of me that hates me tear into me. I cursed myself for the awkward way that I’d try—and fail—to enter conversations by cracking a stupid joke; the self-deprecating persona I’d wear everywhere I went, to the thunderous applause of no new friends made in seven years; cringy memories of simply *existing* in the highschool hallways and getting bullied for the stupid indie band t-shirts I wore that I thought would make me look *smart* and *sophisticated* but actually made me look like a giant tryhard; the gross feeling of simply being in my body and having my abject ugliness perceived by the outside world.

And as we circled closer to the end of the session—with me occasionally hearing the sounds of her pen scribbling over paper following the destructive words I uttered about myself—she finally told me to open my eyes.

11:59AM. One minute left in our meeting.

How was she going to wrap things up?

“That was fantastic work,” she said. “You’ve already made so much progress.”

“I have? I-I kind of… feel like shit.”

“That’s completely natural. It’s all part of the healing process. You’ll learn to trust it.”

“Uhm, alright.”

And then, an earnest look shot my way. “I’m really, really proud of you.”

Despite the misery that I’d conjured up in this controlled and safe environment, her words lit a small fireworks display in my sternum.

She rose to her feet from the chair, and I did the same. Simon says.

As she did, she asked me a final question—

“Do you have a name for the part of you that you identified in this session? This… self-critical, harsh side of your mind.”

The words came almost instinctively. “My torturer,” I said. “It’s my torturer.”

“Your homework for this session is to leave the microphone with your torturer. Do not give it to anyone else.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

She told me things were going to feel draining after the last session, but holy shit the level of lethargy was *not* what I expected.

There were mornings where I felt like I could barely move. Where even the *thought* of being lazy was difficult to access at times. Full stretches of day where I could barely keep my eyes open to watch TV.

I was just sort of there. Existing. Like a husk.

The voice of misery in my head, it turns out, had a whole lot to say. And as hours and days stretched past, it felt as if the voice was amplifying. All the things I was afraid of about myself—that I was unlovable, that I’d always hate myself, that I’d remain useless—were starting to seem more and more concrete. More true.

*Was this really how this was supposed to feel?*

Every time I wanted to ignore Riley’s advice and pass the aux cord in my mind to a more welcoming party—maybe the self-soother in me, or the optimistic dreamer—I’d remember her words.

*“I’m really, really proud of you.”*

I clung onto them like they were an anchor, as the weight in my chest grew exponentially, and used them to drag my increasingly lifeless form into the couch for session 3.

I’m sure my body and face wore my feelings pretty well, but Riley still found a way to chime in with an almost psychic read on the matter—

“This whole week, since you left our last session, has been tough for you. Draining. Demoralizing.”

She’d phrased it like a statement, less so a question.

“Yes,” I said, wanting to say more, but I was just so tired, so I mustered out the same word again. “Yes.”

“There’s a misery, deep inside you, that runs further than you realized.”

“Yes,” I said again. At least I wasn’t as afraid of eye contact anymore. My pupils met hers, and through the cosmic thread I thought I shared with her, I spoke more. “So what do I do now?”

She tilted her head, almost bewildered. “Could you elaborate on what you mean?”

“To feel better,” I clarified. “What am I supposed to do to feel better now?”

She looked away briefly, as if gathering her thoughts. Then she met my gaze again, resolute. “You continue. You honor your honest feelings and thoughts. You sit with them. You live with them.”

I lowered my head, exasperated. Already sinking. “That can’t be right.”

Her voice felt distant now. Like I was in a void, underwater, helpless, useless. “This is what the work is,” I think I heard her say. Muffled. Through static. Lightyears away.

“The work is fucking awful,” I exhaled.

As I fell deeper, I wondered if this was what I deserved for signing up for cheap therapy. Maybe she was in over her head.

Or maybe, the behind-the-TV cord untangling of my various neuroses and traumas was a tall order for anyone, regardless of how qualified they might’ve been.

I shot my thousand-yard stare down at the familiar rug.

I guess I could try to stay in this misery a little longer. Wallow in it, if that was really the point of all this.

I closed my eyes. She hadn’t said a word for a while anyway.

*Maybe if I stay still enough, I can just disappear.*

Then, I felt a warmth at the back of my neck. A comforting, unfamiliar warmth. A soft hand ran up and down my back, consoling. Another hand, with nails gently curling into the hair at the back of my head.

The warmth at the back of my neck persisted.

Kisses.

I was being caressed.

*What?*

“I could tell you were different,” she said. “You have a helplessness that runs so, so, so deep.”

*What are you d—*

“You’re alright. There isn’t a thing wrong with you. You’re perfect, even if the world shuns your pain.”

More kisses at the nape of my neck.

I knew this was against every rule in the therapist-client code. And yet, I didn’t want her to stop. It was the most meaningful moment I’d ever experienced in my life. It felt like she saw me, saw all of me—all the ugly that made up what I really was, and accepted it.

“You’re a special person to me,” she said. “You’re my favorite person.”

And after that, session 3 dissolved into a dreamlike haze. I can barely remember what happened after. I know she held me, I know we spoke, I know she wanted me to continue with the important work we were doing, but beyond that, it all sort of blurred together.

Regardless, this had to be love, right?

People don’t just do that, to people they’re like—academically interested in, right?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I wanted to die.

In the week following the previous session, I had become a zombie.

I was sleeping thirteen, maybe fourteen hours most days, but would wake up feeling like I’d just pulled an all-nighter.

I’d come off of the highest high ever, and yet, I was steeped in a depressive malaise that was as overwhelming as it was incomprehensible.

The very nature of my thinking had become warped. My mental chatter was fully contained to the negative, the tiring, the hopeless, the cynical. The thoughts ping-ponged across my mind quietly and consistently—the remaining dregs of energy in my body being rerouted there and there alone to keep this whole miserable operation going.

I was hoping for an upswing. Praying for one.

Praying for the work to pay off.

In the meantime, hanging on for dear life to the singular spark left in me–the singular flutter in my chest. Getting to see her again.

Session 4.

She was late to let me in.

When she finally opened the door, I noticed she was more jovial than I’d ever seen her. Laughing with a coworker and taking her time to get things set up.

A vibrant smile marked her face as I sat across.

I felt like muck. A big, stinking, ugly, disgusting, should’ve-been-shot-in-the-face-and-left-for-dead-yesterday pile of muck.

And she looked like she was in the prime of her life, radiating a level of pep and excitement worlds away from her usual demeanor. She sized me up and said—

“You’re at your absolute lowest point, aren’t you.”

Again—phrased more like a statement than a question.

I nodded.

“This is the most miserable you’ve ever felt.”

Another nod.

And then—the strangest look from her. A hint of invigoration paired with a hint of sympathy. Like a billionaire trying to feel bad.

“Do you… think you have it in you to try our next exercise?”

*Is it going to help? Is any of this going to help? Or are we just digging my grave here?*

“I…”

“Yes?”

*I don’t know what I’m doing.*

“Can you please, just, hold my hand,” I said, in less than a whisper.

“I’m sorry? Could you please repeat that again?”

“Could you please… hold my hand,” I said again, a few decibels louder this time.

She didn’t move.

“There’s a new exercise I’d like you to do. I think it’ll really help with the work.”

*I don’t get it.*

*What happened?*

*Why don’t you like me anymore?*

And as my thoughts, formed from anxious synapses in the pockets of my chest, arms, and back, spiraled about yet another new thing, about why it felt like my therapist seemed happier yet colder, and that the world where she held me was just an illusion, a lie—I caught a flicker in Riley’s eyes and the suppression of a smile at the corner of her mouth.

*What… are you?*

But my spoken word was just, “Okay.”

She straightened her back against the chair. Eager.

“I want you to take a deep breath,” she said. “And I want you to close your eyes.”

She took a long inhale, motioning for me to do the same. I tried to match.

I knew whatever we tried now was only going to make things worse, yet I followed, propelled by the remaining spark of light in me—a faith, a hope—hope that she was actually in my corner. Hope that she was actually trying to help me.

“So we’ve spent some time giving attention, and a voice, *and a microphone*, to the part of you that dislikes yourself.”

Yes. Yes we have. Probably more than it warrants at this point.

“I want you to try and visualize this part of you now. Try to bring it forward in your mind. Can you see it?”

I focused, and to my shock, in the darkness behind my closed eyes, the image of my torturer was unbelievably and immediately clear—

A face poking out of a thin, black mist.

With the widest smile I’d ever seen. And eyes like glowing slits.

Eager to close the distance and reach me. Excited at the prospect that I was afraid.

“Describe it to me,” she said.

“No.”

“I’m sorry?”

I opened my eyes.

“No.”

I stood up from my seat. Lifeless. Energyless.

A good hard look at the only person I liked, who was thrashing about my insides like it was nobody’s business.

But even in her radiant energy and today’s brightness, she just looked pitiful. Sad and small.

I carcassed away from her, and towards the door, with literal baby steps.

And heard a phrase come from her as I reached the archway.

“I thought you’d be the one who stayed.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I shuffled down the hallway.

The voices and sounds around me were muddled, like we were all underwater.

I was going to leave her behind.

And I was going to return to my life of… light misery. Light depression, light alienation, dopamine-fueled habits chasing light contentment, and subtle despair buried under layers and layers of light distraction.

And for a second, everything settled in my mind, and her words played.

*“I’m really, really proud of you.”*

A step forward.

*“You’re a special person to me.”*

And another. One foot in front of the next, that’s how we were taught to do it.

*“I can tell, from just a couple minutes of talking to you—”*

I tried to erase the voice from my head.

But then the moment—the sensation of being held in her arms, and being kissed by her—started coming to the forefront of my mind.

And almost like a hallucination, the image of it started playing on the walls and doors beside and in front of me, grainy and flickering, as if broadcast by an old, worn-out projector.

And I felt love for her.

And more so I felt pity for her.

And I understood that all of these emotions of compassion for her were irrational and unnecessary.

And I realized it didn’t matter because I’d been compromised by her for quite some time now.

And I walked back.

It felt like it was under my own volition, but—who knows.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*“You came back.”*

I don’t actually remember re-entering the room, nor what I said when I did.

It was all another surreal blur.

When I came to, I was seated out on the couch, holding a goodbye letter that she’d been partway through writing to me before I’d stepped back into her office.

*Dear Elijah,*

*I’m not a normal person.*

*I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember.*

*Some people need socializing. Some people need rest. Some people need sports. Some people need soap operas. Some people need sunshine. I need*

And of course, it ended there, cut off by my return.

I lifted my eyes from the piece of paper in my hands and looked at her to finish.

“I need people’s will to live. In all its forms. Depression, anxiety, hopelessness, misery. These are springs where I get my water.” She looked ashamed as she said it. “I will always cherish the time we spent together. Signed—Riley.”

I let the words sit in my empty body.

No one had ever written me a letter before.

“I’ve been giving you life?” I asked.

“Yes,” she answered.

I understood, truly, this time.

And then I closed my eyes and visualized the entity I’d given life to. I pictured my torturer again.

The face in the fog reappeared.

“What next?” I asked.

“Elijah, you don’t have to do this anym—”

“I wanna try. I wanna try to make this work. What next?”

A hesitation in her response. No words, at first. But then—

“Describe the emotions you feel in your body, as you see the picture in your mind.”

I focused.

“I feel… a tightness in my chest. There’s an uncomfortable, unmovable, weighted box sitting there. And the feeling of it is permeating outwards, and I feel tired, and helpless, and sad, and the sensations are going through my arms, my legs, my back, my head.”

“Label this feeling. What is it?”

“It’s the feeling of not belonging. Of being terrified of the world. Of feeling small, weak, unlovable and unsafe in the face of everything.”

“Good. Now, try to remember the earliest instance when you felt this way. When this feeling of ‘not belonging’ was within you.”

“I…I—”

I let the image of my torturer melt into the void behind my eyelids, and allowed a newer, livelier scene to appear in my head.

“I was at a bar,” I said, “I’d been given an invite to an outing, sort of as an afterthought, and when I got there everyone ignored me and treated me like shit and—”

“I want you to go further back, Elijah. Find an older memory.”

I followed the time-traveling string of self-hate in me and let my mind conjure up new memories.

*High school.*

“It was tenth grade, and I’d just switched schools, and it was first week, and I was already an outcast, *and every lunch hour the kids would*—”

“Even further. Keep going.”

I immediately tried to spin up more scenes in my head.

A new image now. Suburban streets, holding my mom’s hand as she walked me home from school.

“I was seven I think, and mom picked me up after I got in trouble at school, and she uh… told me that she wished I’d never been born, and I didn’t know who to talk to about it because—”

“You’re almost there now. Hold the feeling and go deeper. There must be something more.”

The next one hit me instantly. The recollection of me crawling and knocking something over, and Dad getting unbelievably mad at me—

“It’s so weird, because Dad freaked out, but he was usually so nice, and, why would anyone even get mad at a kid who’s just crawling, like I was so little, it doesn’t even make any sen—”

“I can feel you. We’re so close. Describe how it felt in the moment—”

“It felt confusing, and overwhelming, and I felt unsupported, and unloved, and I didn’t feel safe there I didn’t feel safe—”

Dad’s image in my memory started to transform—the look on his face twisting and warping into something demented—

“Hold this feeling, this exact feeling, and now try to find, perhaps, the earliest instance of this sensation—”

*How can I go earlier than crawling?*

*What am I doing?*

“I…”

And yet, it came.

Something even earlier.

And it was hard to speak.

“What do you see, Elijah?”

I wasn’t sure how to say it.

“I was born, I think.”

“*Yes.*”

“I was in the operating room, and I saw white walls, white everything, and I felt unsafe, and unseen, and the doctors seemed distracted. Disinterested. And this all felt too big, too much for me.”

“*This is the moment,*” she said.

The appearance of the doctors began to shift now too.

“What do you feel now?”

“I was ripped out too soon, I’m at the whim of the world, *I don’t feel safe.*”

“*You don’t feel safe*,” she said. Then—“Hold this moment, frame this moment, press it to your conscience, don’t let it go—”

The whole scene in my head started evolving, into undistilled misery, discomfort, and terror.

The doctors became less human yet more familiar. The room turned to black, as their faces lit up like they were glow-in-the-dark.

They all looked like my torturer now.

Riley spoke intensely. “If this image, this moment, were framed forever, what would the caption be?”

*Why am I doing this to myself?*

“I am not safe or loved in this world,” I said, as both the image and the feeling became hellish. I felt myself sinking.

“Repeat it, like a mantra,” she said. “*You are not safe or loved in this world.*”

“I am not safe or loved in this world,” I said again.

“Again, say it, *with everything you have,*” she shouted, stern, activated, relishing, *receiving life*—

“I am not safe! I am not loved. I never was.”

And as the image, the memory took on a life of its own, turning into a funhouse mirror nightmare where the medical staff grew bigger smiles and twisted forms that stretched up to the ceiling as they peered down on baby Elijah, I heard the doctors say:

""Congratulations, ma'am! And now, he can be unborn.""

I opened my eyes. I had to.

She was crouched in front of me. Inches from my face.

And she too wore the face of my torturer.

Her hand caressed my cheek.

And then—

It was her again. Riley with her own face. Full of life and vigor and sunshine.

“Thank you,” she said with soft, apologetic, bright and open eyes, and I didn’t want to be on this planet anymore and I wished I’d never been born but then she kissed my lips and it was still not okay but it certainly helped.

I’m not sure what the exact day was that I stopped being her client and started being her boyfriend.

Granted, the line was always fuzzy after session three anyways.

I’ve spent the last four weeks living with her.

We’re still figuring some things out.

I can’t be an endless reservoir of energy for her to siphon every single day, as eventually, there’s nothing left for her to drain.

So, on date nights, we’ll go to various locations where she can access some of the raw, palpable emotions of sensitive people. Slam poetry nights are great for this, as are open mics.

Occasionally, we’ll even find a couple arguing in a coffee shop or restaurant and try to find the closest seat.

She tells me that these nights are helpful to tide her over, but that ultimately, she’s a more traditional energy vampire—and hence, much prefers it when she gets all of her energy needs from the one person she’s in a committed engagement with.

And so, on the whole, whether it’s going back through painful memories or conjuring up the image of the part of me that hates myself—always a winner—I do what I can to ensure there’s always something for her to pull from, to inflame. Always misery on hand for her to tap into and find joy from.

The bulk of my days are spent with a severely diminished quality of life. Lower energy all the time, depression, suicidal ideation, wanting to stay in bed all day.

Seeing the worst in everyone—*people are unkind, selfish, machiavellian, flesh-eating, back-stabbing, two faced liars who don’t even know themselves well enough to*—

But then sometimes I’ll spend a nice night with her. And like heroin, it’s a net negative, except for the brief flicker when it goes through my veins.

She’s been much happier as of late. She told me that one of my emotions has been working really, really well for her. She isn’t quite sure which one it is though.

I use my remaining energy to curl a smile. I’m just glad she’s happy. I’d rather not let her know that the emotion is fear.

It’s unfortunate.

I’ve been seeing the face of my torturer more and more since Riley first kissed me.

It shows up on the faces of people as I walk down the street. Sometimes, as a figure at the end of an alleyway. Other times, the weatherman on TV.

It’s taking over all of the faces in my dreams.

And even at night, when she’s caressing my hair, thinking I’m sleeping, and looking down at me and smiling—I see it there too, through the thin cracks of my eyelids.

And I try my best to bear through it.

After all, she’s just getting her needs met.

**And that's the end of the story!** Hooray! Three cheers! Excelsior!

This was one of the stories that didn't make the cut for NoSleep in terms of rules and construction and whatnot. I kept some of the energy of it for ""There's something special about the woman at the bar"" which I ended up being very happy with, and probably wouldn't exist if it weren't for this one being the weird little rejection that it is. Since writing it, I just short of shelved it, but figured just now that it might be a fun one to share for anyone that's interested.

Oh right, I forgot my usual ""disappearing blog"" spiel:

*I wanted to create a space where I could blog about whatever but not necessarily have the poorly written word salad exist in perpetuity. Hence, the world-famous Disappearing Blog!*

The coworker in question is a barista/ (not official in pay but in title) manager, who is always complaining to me about EVERYTHING. 

We barely have any normal conversation, and it feels like she’s using me as a sounding board to bounce her complaints off to. Her complaints, while valid, are starting to wear me down and I’m feeling less and less empathetic when she voices her complaints.

Common complaints include how annoying the boss is, how people are always coming in and she can barely get anything done because all she’s doing is is making coffee, how she doesn’t like certain customers, complaining about other coworkers. Like pretty much everything and anything she will complain about.

She’s even said verbatim ‘like, no offence but I work harder than you guys and I deserve more pay’. Which is moderately true in the sense that she’s always making coffee or doing the ordering and other stuff, but the front of house staff do work exceptionally hard and my job is slightly more technical and complicated than hers but I get less orders. She just has more responsibility overall, rather than I think does more work than us.

I’ve tried calming her down by like agreeing with her, or offering a snack and helping with the front to take some of the heat off of her. I can make coffee, so sometimes I’ll make a couple of coffees or take orders to ease the work load. I’ve even been like ‘hey, look, I get you’re upset, but I’m busy at the moment’ which makes her complain even more.

But it all came to a head last week when I was having an exceptionally hard week due to personal stuff, and she came into my kitchen, dumps the dishes as goes on a rant about how to boss is always kicking her off the coffee machine and making her do all the grunt work (which I don’t doubt since he can be a mega asshole). I was busy with my own prep and service, she’s getting worked up and it’s distracting me to the point that I just snap and say ‘if you’re just going to complain all the time, please find someone else to complain to. I’m busy’. She just huffs off.

Now she just pointedly ignores me but it’s really tense at work and it’s even more uncomfortable than it was when she was complaining, she won’t engage with me even for work stuff, I can’t even join a group convo before she’s huffing and storming off.

My other coworkers don’t usually have to listen to he complains like I do and they’re calling me a jerk for saying that to her. But I don’t think I’m in the wrong because it’s fucking exhausting when someone is in your ear with complaints all the time, so am I the asshole?",4,1731485768.0,AmItheAsshole,6,0.84,False
