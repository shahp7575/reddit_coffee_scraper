Now, as the impact of COVID-19 dissipates, some employers are insisting on a return to office (RTO). This has not gone down well with all employees ‚Äì and many are voting with their feet.*

# [Clive Longbottom, January 29, 2025](https://smartermsp.com/wfh-rto-hybrid-whats-best-for-msps/)

For certain employers, a RTO makes sense: many brick-and-mortar retail and manufacturing environments just cannot operate with everyone working from home. However, for many others, the rationale behind an RTO requirement is less clear-cut.

This largely applies to managed service providers (MSPs). An MSP can carry out much of its work remotely‚Äîprovisioning virtual resources and services, conducting root cause analysis (RCA), and handling most sales, accounts, and customer support just as effectively with remote staff as with those on-site.

# RTO may create stress and lead to lost revenue

There are many things wrong with working from the office, starting with the need to commute. Commuting generally wastes time ‚Äì employees don‚Äôt often carry out work-related activities while traveling to and from work, nor can they attend to much of their own activities. It is expensive dead time, as far as the employee is concerned ‚Äì generally unpaid and non-productive.

For those who need to be at home more often, such as to care for children or aging family members, RTO can create stresses that are hard to manage. The costs of childcare or health coverage can quickly outweigh any benefit of the salary the employer offers.

The arguments used by proponents of RTO are often deceptive. The most common argument is that people working from home don‚Äôt work the hours they are contracted for. Instead, they sidetrack themselves with home activities, playing computer games, or avoiding work.

# New ways to measure productivity are needed

This viewpoint simply indicates a lack of using the correct metrics to measure an employee‚Äôs effectiveness. Two employees, each working a full eight-hour day, are not guaranteed to be equally productive. However, if the metric was based on productivity, then things would become clearer.

For example, if help desk staff are measured by how many calls they resolve to the customer‚Äôs satisfaction, it provides a more meaningful metric. This approach is far better than simply acknowledging that the person sat at their desk for eight hours. This is pretty much how salespeople have been measured, anyway ‚Äì although this tends to directly impact their pay based on a base + commission package. I would advise against using such packages for non-sales staff. Instead, use the metrics to assess their overall productivity, identify areas where they may need help becoming more productive, or decide if you should redeploy them or remove them from employment.

# Collaboration tools are key to success

The next argument tends to be around how effective those WFH can be. The argument goes that individuals are not in an environment where they can easily ask for guidance and help from those around them. While this is correct at a basic level, it highlights a lack of suitable tools and systems for employees to interact virtually. It also points to the absence of resources for identifying previous solutions to issues, and so on. Suitable information-sharing and collaboration systems are all that organizations need‚Äîmany of which MSPs already sell.

Another argument concerns the lack of suitable equipment for those working from home. Laptops, printers, and phone systems may not meet the employee‚Äôs task needs effectively. A simple answer is for the employer to provide the right systems so the employee can carry out the tasks they are hired for. In many cases, this could well be just a device that can connect to a secure virtual desktop in the employer‚Äôs environment, where the employee can then carry out their work.

# Tailoring hybrid work for the employee

Next, we are left with one argument that holds some weight: the possible impacts of no physical interactions for those working in isolation from home. This factor may affect their overall well-being and work dynamics.

Here, there may well be a need for hybrid working ‚Äì sometimes working from home combined with time in the office. I would prefer the mix to adapt to the employee‚Äôs needs, rather than the employer dictating it. Some employees will require more time with physical people around them than others ‚Äì one size does not fit all.

For MSPs, there will be certain use cases where a different approach will be required. Modern entry systems can provide secure access for visitors, allowing customer engineers into specific areas. However, having someone available to assist with non-technical issues, like coffee machines or restroom locations, can help create a better environment. Likewise, someone should be there to ensure the environment looks clean throughout the day.

# Retaining top talent

At the technical level, teams cannot implement new physical equipment remotely. However, teams will generally plan this activity, and engineers can handle the delivery, unpacking, installation, and provisioning of the new equipment when needed. Unplanned issues, such as equipment failure, may need on-call engineers to be available who are close to the data center. Regard such callouts as exceptions and provide additional pay to cover travel time, costs, and so on.

In the end, many workers will need a level of hybrid working. However, there will be a large number where WFH better meets their needs. As an MSP, you have to recognize that you are in a highly competitive environment ‚Äì and good employees in many roles have a considerable choice as to where they go. By adopting a flexible working environment, not only are you likely to hold on to your valued employees, but you will also be able to attract others from less flexible companies.

 It's incredibly defeating to think of all we have known together and this here now be the focal point. To be amongst the downtrodden, heartbroken, confused, and lost souls sending out letters in hopes you may read mine among all the others. 

  
I have read yours. Sigh. I also made the mistake of sifting through the letters today as I had my morning coffee and they had really hurt. I read several in which the writer was telling their person that despite how lost they are, that they accept them and wanted them to know that if they want to know eachother, all they have to do is get in touch. 

I cried knowing that is the concoction that would save me. I wanted that to be you. Not In a way that you were uncomfortable but more or less in a way that we could talk from time to time. I'm grateful for my memory but fear I would one day forget your voice. Forget that way about you that comes over me from a simple glance and those yummy brown eyes. Reality check \*slap\* I'm also reminded and always aware of that likely never happening. I want you to know a few things. I was young and stupid and could not have known the impact the choices I made would have on me and want to smash my head into the wall at the mere thought that I could have been so reckless in regardless to trading in a life of having someone who knew me and the only person I was ever close to, -- because I was unable to see that it wasn't the end. I just wanted to get in front of what I believed was something that meant we wouldn't be able to see eachother anymore and now I know it was a big mistake. The biggest happened a little over a year ago, but the other is close in terms of lack of critical thinking and allowing my feelings to override reality and so here I am doing my best to let you know 

‚óè yes, I assumed pregnancy meant that it was over between us. That was a great surprise to me and something that taught me the importance of caring, enjoying, loving what you have while it's their as it can change in an instant and be gone. 

‚óè that after baby was born I never got to apologize for this but to this day is a great cause of concern and source of pain for me because I didn't know anything about post pregnancy sadness and how truly awful it can be. All these years later and the woman who had given me so much. Her body, her life, her time, her kindness, and anything a man could want and I was too stupid and young to see that you clearly needed a shoulder to cry on and it breaks me that I didn't know about babies or PPD. I remember you reaching out to me and just thinking of that makes me so sad knowing what I know now as I would have never left you hanging. I was just ignorant of all of that and thought you had made your decision to never see me again when in reality, you still loved me. You needed and wanted to see me and I blew it completely. 

‚óè that I never blamed baby for happening. It was lost in translation and I could see it coming off that way but it wasn't. It was me saying baby was a wakeup call to me and not that I loved you less or was baby's fault. It was my fault for not understanding as we hadn't spoken about it at all. I know feelings and experiences and bonding and chemistry play a role in how people are towards one another and I am sorry that i couldn't have related more and I did spend a great deal of time educating myself on mental health related issues and especially boundaries. Learning how to be a better person should i ever have the chance to speak to you again, I'd like to be able to go in and tell you the truth of things that i had blamed you for, tell you how awful I feel when I think of you bringing baby to see me and I didn't come and how that relates very much to how it feels to have this last time around not have just held you a few seconds longer. I did and do love you, but don't expect you to be with me or run off in the sunset. Only hope it rhe ability to allow you to hear me and see me for me, the one who is shy but not around you. The one who crushes on you and will always have feelings but can also be a friend. 

‚óè I never expected to know a time from then till now with lawyers involved. To be told I'd never hear from you in perpetuity is both a challenge, and something I respect as sad as it is. I've heard this before. I have lived thru this before. I was lost and more then once you found me. Id even say you rescued me from a bad place and a deep depression another time and the feeling of one second going thru the motions with you on my mind unsure if I'd ever see you again, to holding your hand in the car the same day was an example of being out in the cold frigid mountain tops to being in the warm and warmth of the living. You had been my guide. I only wanted to have you present in my life. I did not expect (but should have) to become confused frustrated and upset in ways that would ruin everything. I never intended to do what I did I literally woke up and events had taken place in my own life that had paved the way for it and as bad as it looks it was not out of malice. You do not have to love me. I merely hope you know that I love you. You do not need a life line from me, but you deserve to know that hate and malevolence you harbor for me is not matched on my end. You are a free spirit and mistakes had been made on my end that were not your fault and if you want to hurt me, if you want me to suffer even then if u proceed this route I suppose you will have the desired effect. 

‚óè I do not want to be a part of your life if you don't want me to be. I believe that we should speak about things even if that is the only reason we talk. I would love to have you in my life. Tell you the truth of my situation, and prove to you that i would be content with simply knowing you are safe and having the ability to hear from you from time to time. A lot of people myself included, have chosen the wrong path the moment they realized that they were going to go without and/or lost the person who understood them the most. Meant the most. Loved the most. It isn't a copout excuse to throw my life away. That's the last thing I wanted. It was the realization that sobriety and doing right was not all it was built up to be if the one person I had hoped to hear from again eluded me and was unavailable to me. 

  
‚óè everyone who believes that I am expecting a romantic relationship is wrong. It is far too easy to dismiss me and that be the reason. I will never deny that I have feelings, but I am not at all someone who is limited in ability when it comes to you . I really mean it when I tell you that I would be grateful just to have you in my life. It was a mistake to have had that and to have quickly allowed the throes of familiarity and you in your entirety to open up things in me that I had not felt in years. I am sorry for that I truly am. This was something else I could not tell you but wish I could. Hope you at least find it here should we never get that chance. 

‚óè I had hoped to have been honest about where i was in life and what I was going thru would have been a good thing. I suppose I'm used to seeing myself and have grown to accept what has happened to me over the years that I am sorry I felt embarrassed that you u had been taken back by my appearance. Even more of a reason to not have you feel like you have to be involved with me and I hoping for just the chance to talk while I still have a chance. I know I'm still in the infancy of a problem that will likely take my life. A disease. I could stop and do rehab and get myself together because i havent past the point of no return. I forgive you for you and whoever else making fun of me and the things you said about my house being laughed at by someone unknown to me. I forgive you for what you said I did that had people really pissed off at me and I only hope to be forgiven for thinking that you of all people would have come to see me, to go to the beach and sit on a bench and talk about things with our one visit. It is a shame to have spent that the way we did, but I forgive you. If it was to get responses from me with help of your lawyer, if it was because you felt safe going somewhere else, it's all understood. I wish you hadn't allowed others to tell you that I was dangerous in the sense of despite our back and forth familiarity and the fact I truly cherished you, you had come to a conclusion that I would ever lay hands on or intend to do anything that would hurt you. My invitations to sit on the bench to talk about things and look out at the ocean had been something from the heart and I am saddened to think that could be put on the possible danger index when it was wholesome from the beginning. Two people who were not strangers and going thru something traumatic to sit and talk like adults. I have wanted that for years and I am sorry that I took it personally when you said you don't do that at your age, but the next week video call me with your beach hat telling me you had just walked the beach with your friend. I'm sorry that felt like a gut punch. I'm sorry I shut down and doubted everything. 

  
‚óè if I never hear from you again, I hope u are safe. Loved. That you are able to come to terms with my desire to speak to you or have you in my life in a way that works for you that I won't challenge or be upset no matter how restrictive. I mean that. I know u can do better and I'm not trying to hold u back. I suppose I may be dreaming to think that two people like us could be friends. I know it is easier to block block block but think that is nothing to be proud of. I wish you would face me  or reach me back talk to me. I do not hate you. I worry about you. I wonder what has become of you. Aew you safe? Will you ever be able to see me as someone who loves you? Either way, you have the power the ability and the connection to reach me at any time. None of my emails work I changed my number but dm me here if you want. Or don't. I won't hold it against you. Just think since we started this thing together that we didn't have to run from one another over disagreements or hate one another. Not asking for u to help me or save  me. I can do those things. Only asking if there is anything at all in you that knows that I am deeply worried, troubled, and wish to be able to just talk, I am here. I am sorry. I remain unforgiven and replay all that has happened and just worry. 

You have a unique name one of a kind and can't even call u by that without you getting mad. I love your name. I love you. I messed up big time. I know it. If there is a way, I hope to find it. If you are out there, I hope u read this. 



You are loved. You are amazing. Haunted by what could have been and if you don't hate me or if I've ever come to rhe point where I've beat myself up enough I'd like to hear it from u. 

  
\-me

  
P.s im not evil nor am i bad. If anyone knows that it would be you. Never my intention to be jealous of yoh and family time. Just looking back grateful to have been in touch. Miss your pics of what you had cooked for dinner. Your morning coffee with me. Nobody else cares or ever did to share so much with me. I want to be better and to show u how good i can be to you if that is what you want. It doesnt have to be uncomfortable or bring anxietty to see how somrone is doing and have a chanxs to say things they deserve to know. Holding them in will only leave it in a state of suspension but eventually be back again hoping its a better time to talk. 

  
Ive been good in not communicating at all directly. Its a lonely place. If i thought i was dangerous or evil or bad i wouldnt be seeking to say my piece in hopes you could see that you dont have to be scared. The worst feelinf ever when someone you care about is scared.

I finally landed my first fall internship at the end of summer.

I was completely unfamiliar with the job positions related to my major and interests. I didn‚Äôt know which websites were suitable for students looking for internships, how to prepare my resume and cover letter, or how to get ready for different interview stages. At first, I couldn‚Äôt even pass the phone screen.  
First, clarify what you want to do in the future.  
For me, if I‚Äôm not interested in something, I can‚Äôt see myself doing it as a job. I tried applying to several different directions (still a little relevant to my major) and joined school projects to gain real-world experience (with lower requirements than interns). After trying roles in 2 areas, I finally landed my first internship in the 3rd.üòÇ  
Secondly, move toward your ideal role and find projects that can strengthen your resume.  
Based on my internship and full-time job search, and coffee chats with seniors and hiring managers, they all mentioned that **a candidate's major and school name are not the most important factors** (unless the company specifically hires from target schools). What truly matters is **how relevant your projects and experience are to the role you‚Äôre applying for**. For example, even if you graduate from Wharton with a finance major, without any data-related projects, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll land a data scientist role at a local startup. My first internship and later my full-time job, were both unrelated to my major. But I supplemented my experience with industry-related school projects and identified relevant courses on Coursera that matched the job requirements. I like to think of those new courses as forming my minor major.  
Thirdly, revise your resume and start searching for internships.  
When you have projects to include on your resume, present them using the STAR method, clearly highlight and quantify the results you achieved, and use ChatGPT to help tailor your resume to the positions you‚Äôre applying for. (For full-time job searching, I combined Teal with ChatGPT, since full-time applications are usually more competitive and restrictive than internships.) I initially used Indeed to search for internships, but there weren‚Äôt many openings. The same goes for LinkedIn, it‚Äôs better suited for full-time roles. You can still follow recruiters or managers on LinkedIn for opportunity posts, or connect with alumni for potential referrals, though in my case, I never made it. I finally switched to Handshake, which turned out to be a smarter choice. I landed my first internship there, and many of my schoolmates found theirs on the same platform.  
Fourth, prepare your own interview cheat sheet.  
It's the most difficult part for me. I actually started receiving interviews after several applications, but I kept failing and never knew how to solve it. I experienced the most awkward group interview in the world. I even failed the phone screen (I didn't even know how to introduce myself!). I realized I had to prepare my own cheat sheet. It's unhelpful to directly use what ChatGPT generates based on your resume, you must add your own thoughts and practice thousands of times to make sure you're completely familiar with your story. I checked Glassdoor‚Äôs communities to see ex-candidates' reviews, used AMA‚Äôs question prediction feature, and asked ChatGPT to give me example answers tailored to my resume. For general roles, I built a cheat sheet for frequently asked phone screens and behavioral questions. You can even find patterns in tech interviews. For specific roles, I still used this outline and added the details.",1,1742594471.0,csMajors,0,1.0,False

1jgsrbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jgsrbp/at_the_end_of_tunnel/,At the End of tunnel,"My university has tunnels connecting all of the buildings on campus. I‚Äôve been told by my friends from other places this is pretty unique, but I think a lot of schools around here have them. Maybe they just want to make sure students don‚Äôt have an excuse to miss class when windchill reaches -50, maybe they don‚Äôt want us all to starve if a blizzard lasts a little too long. In any case, these tunnels criss cross under the outdoor sidewalks and green spaces of our college, guiding students, staff and factually alike wherever they need go. Most of us who live in the dorms use them daily in  the winter months even if we might eventually pop outside occasionally for some fresh air. I don‚Äôt think anyone wants to brave the elements for their 8am class when they don‚Äôt have to, though. 

The tunnels are not uniform in their construction and some are absolutely sketchier than others. Some are made up of aging plaster walls, poorly lit with burnt out construction style lamps, inexplicably always damp. Most of the shittiest ones go between dorms and parking garages or cafeterias. Places they knew they could cheapen out as much as possible. 

Some of the dorms aren‚Äôt much better above ground either. The place I want to tell you about and its tunnel is one of them. Let‚Äôs call it Grey hall so I can maintain some attempt at anonymity. This shitty dorm must have been hastily and cheaply constructed in the 80s. It  always leaked, and had walls so thin you could hear your neighbor as if they were speaking directly to you. Honestly I get the sense that this building  has been  begging to be torn down practically since it was new and the last 40 some odd years has not done anything to help that. Blizzards, minor floods, a few rough hailstorms - Grey Hall has seen the worst this state had to offer. It‚Äôs probably a miracle they squeezed the years out of it that they did. 

It took first a student breaking this wrist  in the stairwell when they lost their footing on a cracked step and then another one managing to push out a window and fall from the 4th floor before the university finally stopped using the building altogether. As far as I know the kid that fell is still in the hospital. There was just too much maintenance needed all at once and the university couldn‚Äôt risk anymore lawsuits or bad publicity, so they closed it completely after the fall semester. I think they were also tired of addressing all the complaints about it. Everyone hated living there and would escape given any chance they had. By that point there were probably only a dozen students living in the entire massive thing, and heating it during January probably wasn‚Äôt worth it either. 

They closed the only tunnel to Grey Hall before they finished moving all the students out, and said it was the most structurally unsound part.

I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs true but there is more to it. More that I wish I didn‚Äôt know, more that I wish I could just forget. If I weren‚Äôt a senior here I would have dropped out already and driven as far away as possible. I can‚Äôt tell the world, I gotta graduate, but I can at least tell you. 

I live in the next dorm over, so everyday I kept walking past the large barricade they‚Äôd placed at the entrance to the unusually long tunnel to the condemned hall.  It always looked like overkill to me. Why was there a tarp hung floor to ceiling like it was some kind of construction zone? I was certain they were trying to scare us away.  I guess it was pretty successful. Well, for most students. 

Not me though. I‚Äôll admit maybe there is something wrong with my instincts, but the only thing I felt each day was a growing sense of curiosity that was harder and harder to ignore. 

On a Saturday night a few weeks ago, I made my first mistake in a series of a poor choices- I tried hard liquor for the first time. Half a red solo cup full of vodka later, and my inhibitions were eroding by the second. 

I was at a small party with my friends just off campus, and everyone was at least a little bit tipsy. One of my friends had the bright idea to play truth or dare. A lot of the game was spent licking nasty shit, making people embarrass themselves, and of course there were a few raunchy moments between players too. One of my friends, Mike, who happened to live in the same dorm as me,  claimed my dare later in the game. 

‚ÄúDude, you‚Äôve been wondering what the deal is with that abandoned Grey Tunnel, haven‚Äôt you? I caught you staring at it last week, and I thought for sure you were casing the joint. You were looking for weak spots to break in!‚Äù 

I shrugged and tried to take a casual sip of vodka, somewhat unsuccessfully. ‚ÄúI mean yeah? Of course I do! It‚Äôs so menacing, for like no reason. There has gotta be more than just a crumbling hallway right?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell I dare you to prove it!‚Äù Mike said, slapping his hand on the ground with drunken enthusiasm. 

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna die cause some loose brick falls on my head, even drunk I‚Äôm not that stupid.‚Äù 

That made a few of the others laugh, but my friend wouldn‚Äôt be deterred. ‚ÄúOk, we‚Äôll put on like gloves and our biking helmets.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll?‚Äù I pushed. 

‚ÄúWell yeah now I wanna know too! And I‚Äôll make Jim come along!‚Äù 

My friend‚Äôs groggy roommate looked over at the sound of his name. ‚ÄúWait what?‚Äù He asked blearily. 
 
Mike playfully smacked at Jim. ‚ÄúCome on idiot, we‚Äôre going on an adventure for Rachel‚Äôs dare.‚Äù 

Jim groaned loudly. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm so comfy!‚Äù 

Mike started tugging him to his feet. ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs just too fucking bad, get up.‚Äù 

It took a bit to find all that we would need to pry our way through the barricade given that we were still inebriated, however a few folks at the party decided to help us out. One even lent Jim a spare helmet when he realized he‚Äôd left his at his parent‚Äôs house. 

We left the party to cheers of encouragement, but as we stepped into the cool evening air quiet surrounded us for the first time. It left  us each in our own silent contemplation as we crossed the street onto campus. 

‚ÄúWhat if security catches us?‚Äù Jim asked softly. 

I could only shrug. ‚ÄúI guess we gotta make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI can keep watch!‚Äù Mike volunteered. 

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh, ‚ÄúI dunno Mike, I think you might need to sober up a bit more first. ‚Äú 

Mike crossed his arms over his chest but couldn‚Äôt refute that. 

When we got to the blockade we debated how to get through without making our intrusion immediately obvious. It took a bit of awkward scrambling and teamwork but we got through without tearing down the tarp that covered most of the entrance.

Mike was the first one on the other side. He blindly fished his phone out of his pocket and put on the flashlight.  When Jim and I joined him we each did the same  in turn. Scanning the walls and ceiling it was clear that the tunnel really was pretty badly in need of repair. There were cracks and missing plaster everywhere, dramatic holes in the ceiling and several lights were broken. This tunnel had always been a little spooky but illuminated only by our phones it was downright unsettling. 

This tunnel tilted slightly downwards because Grey Hall‚Äôs basement was lower than the ones in the buildings around it, and that night it looked like it could be a tunnel straight to hell. It seemed my fear had finally caught up to me. I closed my eyes and took  a few deep breaths. It was then that I noticed a horrifying smell. I grimace and turned my head away for a moment. Mike had already started walking so he was now a few steps ahead of me. 

All three of us were now completely silent as we crept carefully forward. In my head I told myself it was because we didn‚Äôt want to alert anyone we were down here, but I knew they were just as scared as I was. 

We were quickly nearing the end of the tunnel where it joined up with grey but there was a slight turn before that happened. Mike reached it first.

He stopped dead in his tracks, gasped and frantically scanned the ground with his phone‚Äôs light before   falling back backwards, shrieking. That wasn‚Äôt a sound I‚Äôd heard him make before. I rushed forward to see what he was looking at. 

There,  below a broken concrete ledge, in a shallow divot in the ground, was a the torso of a  rotting human body.  My brain could only process the scene in pieces. In the the beam of my phone‚Äôs flashlight lay at least 3 bodies, all dismembered, some horrifyingly contorted. Their skulls tipped in silent screams and blood stained every last scrap of clothing that was visible. One was an older woman, one was an older man, but the third was a guy who was young enough to be in  one my own classes. I stumbled backwards like Mike had, but tripped slightly and dropping my phone. It fell screen side down, causing the light point upwards and illuminate the entire shallow grave before  us. Beside those first few bodies, which were probably at most a few months old, lay fully skeletonized remains. Their clothes looked older, like way way too old fashioned and weathered to be from any time in the last few decades. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck,‚Äù I muttered frantically shaking my head as if trying to clear my addled drunk thoughts like an etch a sketch. I heard Jim retching a few steps away over my shoulder. Mike  was now shakily trying to scramble to his feet. ‚ÄúWe gotta get the hell outta here man, we have to go, we can‚Äôt be here, holy shit, he stammered incoherently,‚Äù still staring at the corpses before us. He finally turned and as he reached me he shook my  shoulder. ‚ÄúNOW, we have to go  NOW,‚Äù he was shouting. I was  also struggling to avert my eyes from the crime before us, but I did manage to lean down and clumsily retrieve up my phone. 

As Mike began to sprint away, I forced myself to turn and follow him. I could hear Jim only a step or two behind me. Our exit over the barricade was not as graceful as our entrance and it was now pretty obvious someone had gone through it. We barely had the sense to care. 

We paused for a minute in the better lit intersection of the tunnels. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt go back to my room.. my roommate, I just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd say‚Ä¶Where‚Ä¶where the hell do I go?!?‚Äù I met first Mike and then Jim‚Äôs eyes for the first time since our discovery. They looked at each other and seemed to silently and instantly come to an agreement.

‚ÄúRachel, come to our dorm. I know someone with a cot we can borrow if you want‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ please, stay with us, at least tonight?‚Äù Mike asked. The weight of his words were heavy with fear and concern. I swallowed and began to nod my head, looking at Jim again who attempted to offer an extremely half hearted smile. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù was all I could say in response. 

We started to head down the tunnel that lead to our dorm building but as I passed by a staircase I stopped dead in my tracks. ‚ÄúActually, you guys can we walk outside? I know it‚Äôs cold but uh‚Ä¶‚Äù I didn‚Äôt need to finish that thought, as my friends seem to be relieved I‚Äôd thought to offer an alternative to staying down here any longer. 

The night outside barely seemed dark to us now as we trotted anxiously towards our home for the school year. The sounds of the late winter night were faint but still reassuring. 

Luckily Jim and Mike lived on the first floor so didn‚Äôt take us long to get in and collapse. I perched on one of their desk chairs, bring my knees up against my chest as I hugged my legs. There was a long heavy silence as both boys sat on the floor near by. 

Jim spoke first. ‚ÄúWe have to tell someone.‚Äù I nodded mechanically in response. 

‚ÄúOk but like who? Anyone coulda done that, security, a professor, another student‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think we can trust anyone.‚Äù Mike sounded frustrated and it was clear paranoia was starting to set in for him. 

That question and observation inspired another extended pause full of dread. 

‚ÄúThose people weren‚Äôt all killed at the same time,‚Äù Jim was quieter as he spoke. 

‚ÄúDo you think it was a whole group of people that did it? Like a secret blood cult frat or something? Like as a ritual once every few years or something?‚Äù Mike asked. 

I couldn‚Äôt help but snort a brief barking laugh. Mike‚Äôs head snapped in my direction as his glare shot daggers at me. 

I put my hands up defensively. ‚ÄúSorry dude, I don‚Äôt mean to like shit on that theory, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ this whole thing is so cosmically fucked up and unbelievable. It feels completely unreal. Like sure why not a blood cult fraternity? Anything is possible now I guess!‚Äù 

Mike sighed. ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have dared you to do that. We could still be shitfaced at that party, just doing stupid shit like licking a toilet seat instead.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI still probably would have thrown up,‚Äù Jim offered. That made Mike and I laugh for real in a way that genuinely eased the tension a bit for the first time. 

‚ÄúMaybe we should figure it out in the morning? We could try to sleep‚Ä¶. or at least  rest‚Ä¶‚Äù I proposed half heartedly, knowing deep down that anytime I actually closed my eyes I would probably only see those pale bloated faces from here on out. 

Mike looked unsure but Jim agreed with me. We decided to turn most of the lights off but kept on a single desk lamp. I was sure the boys would tease me for asking to have a little more light, but they seemed just as reassured by the idea. It wasn‚Äôt possible to get the cot that night so they tossed me a few extra blankets and I made do. I balled up my sweatshirt as a make shift pillow, and just stared up at the ceiling. Luckily it was already almost 4am by that point, so daylight was only a few hours away. 

I must have managed to doze off at somepoint because I woke up to Mike swearing again. As memories of last night began to return to me I felt myself paralyzed by dread. 

‚ÄúRachel I saw you open your eyes, come on you gotta check your email!‚Äù 

I groaned loudly, and with a lot of effort, I managed to force my arms to move. 

‚ÄúMike can we like, I dunno, grab some coffee or something first,‚Äù I asked, desperately hoping to delay the inevitable. 

Mike shook his head as he clambered down from his bunk. He shoved his phone in my face, and I blinked a few times before grabbing it. On the screen was an email that appeared to be addressed to all students. It was from our school‚Äôs President and the subject line read: URGENT SAFETY ALERT. The email went on to describe a  break in at Grey  Hall. Anyone with any leads could report them to campus security in exchange for more dining dollars. Any staff or faculty perpetrators would be fired, any current student perpetrators would be expelled, and any former student perpetrators could have their degrees revoked. The school was already working with local authorities and if the school‚Äôs punishments weren‚Äôt already enough, anyone caught could face jail time. 

The message was clear as day to me: we know that you know, and you better keep silent. I threw the phone back to Mike and curled up again. 

‚ÄúDoes mean they already know about the bodies?‚Äù Mike asked, still in disbelief. 

I just shrugged, ‚ÄúI dunno Mike, maybe they knew about them all along.‚Äù

He furrowed his brow, ‚Äúwhat do mean Rachel?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI mean you know the rumors as well as I do, they only closed Grey hall to avoid more bad press. I don‚Äôt know that they actually care that Daisy or Ishwaq got hurt. 

‚ÄúSo what do we do now then?‚Äù 

I shrugged again, ‚ÄúPray we can still graduate?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat if they kill someone else?! Someone we know? What if they kill one of us?‚Äù 

I looked him in the eyes and replied in a cold deadpan voice, ‚ÄúWell, then I guess I hope whoever finds me under the concrete is less of a coward than I am.‚Äù ",3,1742594357.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1jgsr5h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jgsr5h,Please recommend rugs for my living room,"Looking for rug recommendations or some design ideas for my giant living room. I need 2 rugs actually, one in the usual sitting area in front of the couch and one in the corner where the existing rug is (this is where the room transitions between the kitchen and entryway).

The sitting area is quite large. From the front of the loveseat across the room to the fireplace is 15ft and from the front of the couch to the entertainment center is 11ft so I was thinking a rug size around 14x10.

The second rug is mandatory because the white tile is very slippery and I‚Äôve had multiple people slip and fall in that spot when turning the corner from the kitchen to entryway through the living room. That current rug is 6x4 but I‚Äôd like a new one to be at least 7x5 or 7x6 to get more coverage over the slippery tile in that area. 

I will probably replace the coffee table and end tables and curtains in the near future so matching those isn‚Äôt critical. Would love to get new couches and flooring but won‚Äôt be able to afford that anytime soon. 

Budget is $200 for the smaller rug and $300 for the bigger one.",1,1742594345.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

1jgsp92,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1jgsp92/how_i_landed_my_first_internship/,How I landed my first internship,"I started searching for an internship last spring, but because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I wasted several months during that time. I finally landed my first fall internship at the end of summer.  
I was completely unfamiliar with the job positions related to my major and interests. I didn‚Äôt know which websites were suitable for students looking for internships, how to prepare my resume and cover letter, or how to get ready for different interview stages. At first, I couldn‚Äôt even pass the phone screen.  
First, clarify what you want to do in the future.  
For me, if I‚Äôm not interested in something, I can‚Äôt see myself doing it as a job. I tried applying to several different directions (still a little relevant to my major) and joined school projects to gain real-world experience (with lower requirements than interns). After trying roles in 2 areas, I finally landed my first internship in the 3rd.üòÇ  
Secondly, move toward your ideal role and find projects that can strengthen your resume.  
Based on my internship and full-time job search, and coffee chats with seniors and hiring managers, they all mentioned that **a candidate's major and school name are not the most important factors** (unless the company specifically hires from target schools). What truly matters is **how relevant your projects and experience are to the role you‚Äôre applying for**. For example, even if you graduate from Wharton with a finance major, without any data-related projects, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll land a data scientist role at a local startup. My first internship and later my full-time job, were both unrelated to my major. But I supplemented my experience with industry-related school projects and identified relevant courses on Coursera that matched the job requirements. I like to think of those new courses as forming my minor major.  
Thirdly, revise your resume and start searching for internships.  
When you have projects to include on your resume, present them using the STAR method, clearly highlight and quantify the results you achieved, and use ChatGPT to help tailor your resume to the positions you‚Äôre applying for. (For full-time job searching, I combined Teal with ChatGPT, since full-time applications are usually more competitive and restrictive than internships.) I initially used Indeed to search for internships, but there weren‚Äôt many openings. The same goes for LinkedIn, it‚Äôs better suited for full-time roles. You can still follow recruiters or managers on LinkedIn for opportunity posts, or connect with alumni for potential referrals, though in my case, I never made it. I finally switched to Handshake, which turned out to be a smarter choice. I landed my first internship there, and many of my schoolmates found theirs on the same platform.  
Fourth, prepare your own interview cheat sheet.  
It's the most difficult part for me. I actually started receiving interviews after several applications, but I kept failing and never knew how to solve it. I experienced the most awkward group interview in the world. I even failed the phone screen (I didn't even know how to introduce myself!). I realized I had to prepare my own cheat sheet. It's unhelpful to directly use what ChatGPT generates based on your resume, you must add your own thoughts and practice thousands of times to make sure you're completely familiar with your story. I checked Glassdoor‚Äôs communities to see ex-candidates' reviews, used AMA‚Äôs question prediction feature, and asked ChatGPT to give me example answers tailored to my resume. For general roles, I built a cheat sheet for frequently asked phone screens and behavioral questions. You can even find patterns in tech interviews. For specific roles, I still used this outline and added the details.

1jgsobi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1jgsobi/cat_uses_litter_box_sometimes/,Cat uses litter box... sometimes,"I have 4 cats and 3 litter boxes. One of the boxes is self cleaning and uses crystals. All are well maintained. One of the cats uses the boxes sometimes, but frequently she doesn't, and there are patterns. Medically, she's fine. We had her checked and told the vet what she was doing. No issues there. She eats and drinks just fine. She plays and snuggles, and by all other measures, she's totally normal. 

At first, she would pee on the couch where I usually sit. When we got our last cat and that cat snuggled up more to me, she started being friendlier with my husband. That's when she started peeing on his clothes that he leaves on a chair.  Sometimes she pees in the same place under that chair. So there seems to be an element of ownership that she's displaying. 

She also seems to prefer soft things, and things that are out of place. For example, if a canvas shopping bag falls on the floor, she'll pee on it if I don't pick it up quickly. If we leave a box out for them to play with, she'll pee in it within a few days. We have a circular cardboard scratching toy that they all love to sleep in. She started peeing in that recently. It sits on our hearth, and she started to pee on the hearth next to the toy on the hard stone. 

She also poops outside of the boxes. There is one corner of the rug where she loves to poop. She'll frequently scratch on the rug when she's done like she's covering it up. That has become increasingly common recently. Sometimes she'll poop under the coffee table or under my father in law's bed. 

Generally, they all get along. They're all fixed. Our one male cat does go after her sometimes, but she has no interest in playing with him and she runs away. Other than ownership, that's the only thing I can think of that's causing this behavior. But she doesn't have an issue when she uses the boxes. She moves around freely to eat and drink. I don't know what to do. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",3,1742594122.0,CatAdvice,1,1.0,False

1jgsmy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jgsmy2/the_bambino_plus_is_overrated_and_should_not_be/,The Bambino Plus is overrated and should not be recommended as much as it is,"Like many people, I wanted a good beginner espresso machine that'll last me a long time. I got the Bambino Plus after much research and general consensus. 

I'll start by saying when it works, it is in fact a great unit that produces consistently good lattes. I'm not necessarily a ""snob"", but I like fancy coffee shop lattes and can tell the difference enough. Does it make REALLY REALLY good lattes? No. Does it make lattes that are great for your daily coffee that you don't need to spend $5-6 on shitty Starbucks lattes? Absoltuely. 

I could have taught myself just fine to do it all on a ""real"" machine, I just don't have the time to do it in the mornings. I like pressing 2 buttons that do everything while I make my breakfast, and then all I need to do is pour steamed milk into an espresso. 

Now, there's a caveat to how well it pulls - I found the stock portafilter to be meh at best. I upgraded it almost immediately, and it made a huge difference. I've been using it at least once a day for 2 years now. Again, when it's happy and working, I really enjoy what it makes.

But if it makes a good latte, why do I think it's overrated?

Just wait until it decides it needs a cleaning, descaling, etc. It will always catch you when you REALLY need your morning coffee at the worst possible time.

What's involved? Well, usually I pull my espresso just fine. Then when I go to steam, it won't let me. It starts flashing lights that don't make any sense, and the bad diagram on the water container that you need to remove to look at is no help. So I spend a few minutes googling to find it. Want instructions from Breville? TOO BAD. HERE'S A 5 MINUTE VIDEO FOR SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A SIMPLE, ""PRESS THESE 3 BUTTONS AND DO IT"". 

So now I'm doing the dance to clean my device with my espresso getting cold. 

""But why don't you just skip it and do it after?""

Great idea! If it would let you. There's no way around. You can't reset it. You can't unplug/plug it back in. Nothing. It will not let you proceed until you've run a cleaning on it. Maybe the brilliant people at Breville finally fixed this incredibly terrible flaw in the UX, but the one I got 2 years ago doesn't let you... and there's PLENTY of people in discussions with this gripe.

Ok, so now I'm cleaning it, deprived of caffeine and frustrated. ENJOY THE POOL OF WATER THAT'LL FORM UNDERNEATH! You thought you were just going to get a latte right now? HAHA! You have to clean me. AND you have to mop up my mess! Why? The damn collection tray is tiny and it doesn't have much of a seal to catch the discarded water. 

So after it's finally done, I can steam my milk to pour into my cold espresso.

Oh, but wait until it needs a full cleaning and descaling. Then you need to find a big enough bowl that is oddly shaped enough to fit under the steam wand. Or if you're like a normal human with normal kitchen supplies, you'll need to just keep rotating out bowls of hot water as it randomly shoots out hot water from the steam wand or espresso spout.

All of this could have been avoided if there was some sort of warning indication. Maybe a light pattern that flashes when you're getting to 10 more pulls before a cleaning cycle is needed. I mean the lights wouldn't make sense right away, but at least I'll know SOMETHING is up that I should check out later on in the morning. Or hey, maybe a small light somewhere that lights up to warn you a cleaning is needed. Nah, that would be too much ""function over form"".

Maybe just let you skip it and do it later. It's your device, why are you forced to do this? I'll deal with the consequences of a slightly less good latte from the one I had yesterday, and then I'll clean it when I'm caffeinated, happy, and have the time to move the device to a location to catch the mess it makes. 

Anyways, I'm posting this now because I have a couple week old newborn. It was a really fun morning just really looking forward to a latte after 3 hours of sleep, only for the dipshits at Breville to just take a big steaming pile of shit on me with their atrocious UX for maintaining it. 

Nothing about the maintenance of it makes sense or is ""beginner"" friendly, and all of it could easily have been solved with a device that's ""smart"" enough to know it needs to be cleaned. I guess for an espresso machine it's good, but for a general consumer device in 2020s there's no excuse for the poor design.

There HAS to be better devices out there. I'm sure there's ones that may be slightly a tad less good quality, but just so much less of a headache on a ""semi-automatic"" device. Just a word of warning to everyone out there to please be very wary of the tons of paid reviews out there that recommend Breville to beginners. You'll love it, then absolutely hate it with every bone in your body. 

**tldr:** The Breville Bambino Plus is a great device until it isn't when you really really need your coffee. Then you'll wish for crimes against humanity charges to be filed against the executives. ",0,1742594015.0,espresso,6,0.25,False

Last night's guest left coffee grounds and all of the coffee making things all over the counter, a french press full of coffee out, a cup in the sink and the dishes in the rack all needed to be washed with visible chunks of food and even though they were wet, the dish sponge was dry.

I did my best not to stare, but let's just say I'm glad I was wearing sunglasses. :)  She was heading in the same direction I was, so I fell in behind her.  Sure enough, she went into the coffee place, and I wound up in line directly behind her.

As we're waiting in a fairly long line, I noticed her glancing at me and smiling.  I wasn't in the headspace for a meet-cute, so I didn't respond except to smile politely.  She then takes her phone out of her purse, makes a call that really seemed like one she wanted me to overhear, and I was able to glean from that that she's in real estate.  She hangs up the phone, turns to me, and says ""haha, business never ends,"" or some little icebreaker along those lines.  

So at that point, we're talking, and it's a nice, animated conversation.  She's one ahead of me in the line, and after she's ordered and paid for her drink, she hands me her card and says something like ""if you ever want to talk about local restaurants or something other than real estate.""  I thanked her and told her I'd definitely be reaching out, then she left.

I have a 2024 Gaggia Classic Evo Pro that I love and make great coffee with. I use a Timemore C2 grinder which has a little over 1 year now and I got an aliexpress disc to have more step adjustments. Even so, the steps are to big for precise adjustments in extraction. 

  
I can manage to get 1:2 yield in 25-30s with most beans I tried, but when dialing in by taste, 6b setting takes around 30s, 7 (the immediate coarser setting) is way too fast (18s, sour) and 6a (the immediate finer setting) takes around 48s and is way too bitter. Also, the coffee comes out sometimes in a wiggled fashion, not rat-tail like during all extraction, and curved inwards (which tells me I could grind finer, perhaps?).



I use the non-pressurized basket, have a calibrated tamper, a proper wdt tool and pay close attention to puck prep. I got a bottomless portafilter and it will arrive next week.

  
I am saving up $$ to get a proper grinder and I would like some recommendations. Which grinder do you guys use with your gaggia classic? I am pretty muscular so I wouldn‚Äôt mind it being hand-grinder hehe! My budget is preferably below $200.

1jgsgun,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jgsgun,My first decent roast,"** Intro **
Hi all, first off, thank you everyone for the wealth of information in this sub! It's been pretty fun researching all the techniques and strategies for roasting coffee, and I've been thoroughly enjoying the hobby so far. 

Beans are an Ethiopian Guji Natural Process 

** Roaster **
- I bought cheap Kaka G400 drum roaster about a month or so ago to play around with as a foot-in-the-door for the hobby (already thinking about upgrading to a Skywalker so I have more control compared to this roaster). Bought the Masttech and thermocouples to go with it to help run Artisan.
- I noticed airflow is a significant issue with this roaster, so I added a heatgun as part of the process (Been experimenting with when to start the heat gun and noticed kicking it on around the time of FCs has worked well)
- While the heatgun is nice for increasing airflow, if its pointed directly at the beans from a close-enough distance, it will instantly stall the roast. (Need to play around with the heat gun heat settings + distance from roaster).

** Timeline **
- 340F Charge (I lowered the heat for the first 30-45 seconds as an attempt to do some sort of soak, not sure if it did anything but I did notice less tipping compared to previous roasts)
- Turning Point at 00:46 125F
- DE at 6:25 at 317F
- FCs probably at 10-11min (very low development time roast, need to improve on that)
- Dropped at ~12:34 410F.
- 300g batch (tried smaller batch so I have enough for 1 more batch of these beans)

** Roasting Notes **
- I forgot to press the button for whenever first crack started
- Might have lowered the heat a little too much after hitting DE
- Might have called Dry End too late
- Not enough momentum going through maillard phase?
- Turned on Heat gun on low after FCs (probably why I forgot to press the FCs button lmao)

** Tasting Notes **
- Slight roastiness left in bean, but I imagine it will go away
- Medium bright and acidic finish, little to no bitterness, could probably be brighter if I sped up the Maillard phase more?
- Tasting some sort of nuttiness with the acidity and fruitiness

** Overall ** 
- Compared to my previous attempts at roasting light, this roast did not have that grassy underdeveloped taste.
-Next time I want to try and blast through maillard for next roast with these beans.

** Questions **
- What steps I should take to get through the maillard phase faster to increase acidity? I've had issues with tipping before and was wondering if I should kick on the heat gun for increase airflow earlier on in the roast.
- Should I do a soak on my roasts given my batch size? My max batch size is about 400g but I usually aim for 350g or so. I did notice there was less tipping in this batch but I don't know if the cause is from a smaller batch size or soaking.
- Any other tips or things I'm not doing that I should be?

Thanks in advance for reading all my thoughts, notes, word fart, and for any tips/suggestions you have for me!

1jgseyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1jgseyq/beans_recommendations/,Beans recommendations,"Hello. 

I am new to roasting, been doing it about a month on the SR800. I'm looking for recommendations on beans that you've enjoyed that are more towards the more ""traditional"" chocolate/carmel/nutty flavors. I do like some fruit and spice notes, but would prefer them not to be the dominant flavors. Not big on citrus and floral notes, getting there, but not there yet. I mostly drink espresso, but I do have at least one pour over a day so recommendations for either/both are appreciated. 

Some beans I've tried thus far 

Sweet Maria's:
Brazil Pedralva Fazenda Furnas

Yemen Mokha Sanani

Nicaragua Maracaturra Los Medios

Costa Rica Tarrazu Casa de Piedra

 Sweet Maria's Liquid Amber Espresso Blend

I did have a Brazilian, Colombian, and Guatemalan beans from toastmasters, but they came with the roaster that I ordered and didn't keep the bags. They were alright, but nothing I really took note of. I guess I have the roast notes somewhere that should have the names, but I'm at work thinking about coffee

He‚Äôs been fully recovered since then. 

He‚Äôs a 4 year old dachshund, and has a habit of eating things he‚Äôs not supposed to (bathroom trash, underwear, socks, etc) and today he vomited brown liquid that smelled like poop, with a hint of a white swirl in it. A little bit later he had a little spit up of a much lighter brown with some white swirled in it that still smelled like poop but was much less potent. It wasn‚Äôt like coffee grounds or chunky, like the same texture as regular liquid dog vomit. He doesn‚Äôt eat poop really so I‚Äôm doubtful it that was the case. He‚Äôs otherwise acting normal, abdomen isn‚Äôt tender, not in any pain, eating and drinking just fine, and I would say he isn‚Äôt lethargic but it can be hard to tell since he sleeps for most of the day normally but he isn‚Äôt acting abnormally at all.

Is it possible that this could be a one off thing? Obviously if it gets worse or it‚Äôs accompanied by other symptoms I‚Äôll take him to the vet, but at the moment I‚Äôm just trying to gauge if this could be a one off thing since his last visit ate at my wallet way too much.

Since there were no traces of them, the police zeroed in on Ching-jing and Chih-chung as their main suspects. The police inputted Chih-chung's name into their computers and saw he had an active warrant out for his arrest, issued by the Taipei District Court.

March 23, 2012, Chih-chung and Ching-jing went to a cosmetics store in Taipei‚Äôs East District with a photo of a middle-aged woman in hand. They claimed to be teachers at a local school and as part of a celebration, they wanted Ching-jing to look like the woman in the photo who they claimed to be the school principal.

The store owner didn't question any of this and agreed to the makeup fee of 8,000 New Taiwanese Dollars and got to work, the make-up artist got to work on Ching-jing. But when it was over, the two left without paying. In retaliation, the store owner took them both to court for fraud.  The court agreed to take on the case and both were issued a subpoena but when neither showed up, a warrant was issued for their arrest.

When the police went to question the owner, the case only got more twisted. They showed the owner a picture of Yi and he told them that she was the woman in the picture the two showed them. Ching-jing wanted to be made to resemble her mother.

Perhaps, Ching-jing disguised herself as her mother in an attempt to steal or transfer the family's assets, Yi found out about this, and the two got into a fight and the fight ended with Yi dead and the two on the run.

The police spoke with their telecom provider and asked for Yi, Ching-jing and Chih-chung's phone records between May 1 - May 4. The results were damning.

The signals pinged Tzu Chi Hospital in Hualien, only 55 kilometres from Fengbin. According to the signals, the two had stayed there for quite a while starting at noon on May 1.

On that day, Ching-jing also made a call to the sales department of Osta International Co., Ltd., which sold stun guns and batons. The police contacted Osta to ask them what the call was about. According to the company's manager, Ching-jing purchased both a Lightning SWAT stun gun and a Thunderbow electric baton on May 1. This promising lead would end up being a red herring. The call in question was to return the items and they were both unused.

Next, the police spoke to a car rental company the three had used. They had rented a car on April 30, and it was due to be returned with the rent paid on May 1. However, Ching-jing called to request an extension and didn't end up returning the vehicle until May 4.

As the rental period was long overdue, the owner of the business wanted to inspect the vehicle. He opened the trunk and was struck by a foul odour he described as ""disgusting, fishy"". Chih-chung said the smell was normal as they had transported live seafood. The owner had no reason to question this explanation.

But what the owner couldn't ignore was how the smell lingered. After a week, the odour still persisted and they had to open up the trunk's entire compartment to look for it. Inside, they saw a pool of reddish, contaminated water underneath. The owner simply decided not to rent out the car and waited until June when the smell went away on its own.

After hearing this story, the police impounded the car and conducted a thorough forensic sweep of the vehicle. Under the compartment, the police found human blood but the samples were too degraded for any meaningful testing to be done.

The car had a tracker on it as well so the police pulled the data from that. At around 2:58 p.m. on May 3, the vehicle drove onto Hualien, Taiwan Highway 11, 66.1K,"" which was just a 10-minute drive from where the body was found.

[The car captured by a highway camera](https://preview.redd.it/3zapif1u14qe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=85c4a907a8561456197236822ca49c32c8528b17)

The police then looked into Ching-jing's transactions made using her bank cards. At around 7:38 p.m. on May 3, she purchased a bottle of ""Flower Fairy Odor Master,"" a steel brush, six rolls of ""De Yi"" kitchen paper towels, and a bottle of ""Mao Bao"" All-Purpose Laundry Detergent at a supermarket in Ji'an, located in Hualien County. They were likely used to clean up the vehicle.

On the morning of April 28, she had also rented a storage unit and from 5:39: p.m. to 9:17: p.m. on May 4, the unit door was opened 10 times. Unfortunately, there weren't any cameras at the storage unit but nonetheless, it was likely being used to hide some evidence.

[The storage unit](https://preview.redd.it/yi34qp8y14qe1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=923576cd91313af06ebd81fba48341b44d26f782)

Despite all of this damning evidence, actually finding the two was difficult. Even before the murder, the two had no fixed address and as it took two months to identify Yi, they had a two-month head start. Luckily, being creatures of habit, they still spend most of their time at internet cafes. Plainclothes officers were deployed to various internet cafes in both Taipei and Hualien to simply lie in wait in case the two showed up.

On September 7, a group of plainclothes officers observed the two enter an internet cafe in Taipei and their behaviour seemed...odd. Ching-jing was showing no emotion over her mother's murder and as they made their way to a private room, Ching-jing and Chih-chung were publicly kissing and rubbing their private parts against one another.

Before they even reached that room, the officers tackled the both of them to the ground and pried away a bag Ching-jing was carrying.

https://preview.redd.it/jytfpi3024qe1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=30510fe7f709f8d6cdcba4d14fd11923541084a5

[Chih-chung and Ching-jing arrested at the internet cafe](https://preview.redd.it/39i35si124qe1.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=54434c0d79388552e07a02044c4a6861e75f1e95)

They then searched the bag and found Yi's ID card, driver's license, health insurance card, and keys. Interestingly, Ching-jing also had her father's ID card as well.

On September 8, the police then confiscated a suitcase and a large number of documents that the two had been hiding at a rental space.

[The suitcase](https://preview.redd.it/iu2oqw5424qe1.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=cffb7b4777e4c1c88b93ce39b1fa788fb56d8f98)

On September 18, the police searched the storage unit the two had been renting and recovered four scout ropes, a bundle of thick iron wire, a bundle of fine iron wire and three rolls of tape.

[The tape](https://preview.redd.it/pgmnz2o524qe1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aca46bc5874668b60cfdf21f8bf7effc319479b)

One pair of handcuffs and one pair of leg irons, two utility knives, two pairs of scissors, one folding knife, three diagonal pliers, one tiger pliers, one can of pepper spray, one electric shock gun, one roll of large black plastic bags, four maps including one of Hualien County, the seal of Yi's husband, a seal box, Yi's seal box, a self-made CD by Yi, a photo album of Yi, as well as dust covers, women's hats, glasses, and other personal items.

On October 9, the ropes were inspected and had a total of 4 pieces and 8 broken ends. The broken ends were compared to the rope around Yi's hands and forensics confirmed them to be a match, and both were likely cut using the same tool. The wire wrapped around Yi's neck was also compared to the bundle of iron wire found at the storage unit. They were also both the same and thus another match.

Based on this, the two were both questioned but they denied any involvement. In fact, they both blamed Yi's husband and accused him of being the murderer. His motive, he wanted to keep all of Yi's property for himself and stop their children from inheriting any of it.

According to them, the relationship between Ching-jing's parents was a highly unstable one, the two argued frequently and even got physical with each other when it came to property disputes. Yi's husband had been repeatedly injecting her with a nerve-blocking agent and had repeatedly threatened to ""throw her into the sea"". Yi had called Ching-jing several times to vent or cry about his abuse which was the true reason she and her father had no contact with one another.

On May 1, when Ching-jing and Chih-chung called Yi to discuss viewing potential homes, they heard a fierce argument in the background and Yi was barely able to speak to them. Eventually, the call was hung up and the two had to view the houses on their own.

On May 2, they were wandering around the Neihu District of Taipei when they suddenly saw Ching-jing's father hurriedly dragging a large suitcase. When they approached him to ask where he was going and what he was doing, he didn't even acknowledge them and kept dragging the suitcase.

On May 3, Chih-chung and a friend of his went to Taiwan's east coast to transport seafood and by complete coincidence, came across Yi's husband once more. Bizarrely, even though he should hate Chih-chung more than anyone, he asked to borrow 50,000 yuan, not New Taiwan Dollars, but Chinese Yuan. Why? Well for no reason he openly confessed to killing Yi on May 1 and that her body was in the suitcase which he threw into the ocean. He wanted the money to flee to China and hoped Chih-chung would keep it a secret.

Chih-chung was shocked and horrified but agreed simply because he was the father of his self-proclaimed ""fianc√©e"". Chih-chung soon felt guilty after seeing how depressed Ching-jing had grown after being unable to contact her mother.

Her father must've felt the same as he soon wrote a letter to Ching-jing confessing to the murder and detailing how he did it. To prove they were telling the truth, the two presented to the police, the diaries, letters, and promissory notes sent to them by Ching-jing's parents. Some of these documents were also seized from the suitcase.

The police read them and saw seven letters, diaries, and promissory notes all signed by Yi's husband. They all read as follows.

""X your mother Yi, you dragged my big matter, don't hate me for killing you."" Signed on March 28, 2012.

""X your mother Yi, I went to see Qin Buzhi Zi today, I will definitely kill you and throw you into the ocean."" signed on March 30, 2012.

""X your mother, Yi, I inject her with Succi every day, inject her until she coughs up blood."" Signed on April 12, 2012.

""Jing, I received the door card today, I will keep the card and lock, you don't enter the storage unit. Father"" Signed on April 29, 2012.

""Promissory note. I, today May 3, 2012, borrowed 50,000 yuan from Mr. Zeng. The 50,000 yuan will be personally handed over to Tsai Ching-jing on September 1, 2012. Borrower May 3, 2012, early morning on Yitai 9 Road""

""I committed the crime and killed Yi, I went to Qin Buzhi Zi. My method of committing the crime, you keep it secret, it's Yi's fault, dragging me into a big matter, it's Yi's fault that bad things happened, I am very uneasy about breaking the law, you need to keep quiet! Father"" Signed on August 28, 2012.

""I admit that I killed Yi, and threw her into Qin Buzhi Zi. Your husband found my itinerary and saw me on Yitai 9 Road, I am very uneasy every day, you can't speak about my method of committing the crime, you must keep quiet. Father"" Signed on August 30, 2012.

Ching-jing also showed police letters from her mother as well which also seemed very incriminating.

""Jing, your father wants to kill me and throw me into the sea, I will die. Mother"" Signed on April 14, 2012.

""Jing, I won't transfer the house, your father holds the iron tools to pinch me, I can't live. Mother"" Signed on April 16, 2012.

""Jing, your father bullies me every day, I will have no life, I have no home. Mother"" Signed on April 21, 2012.

""Jing, your father injects me with Succi every day, I will die. Mother"" signed on April 22, 2012.

""Jing, I have received More's card. Mother"" Signed on April 29, 2012.

The police actually found themselves humouring this claim. Yi's husband still had an odd reaction to her disappearance, he seemed indifferent to the fact that he couldn't contact her for several days and was still in the mood to travel overseas.

Without any signs of a struggle, the police still couldn't determine how the two managed to subdue Yi, but according to the notes, her husband had been regularly drugging. According to the forensic expert, Succi would also dissipate fairly quickly so it wasn't odd that it couldn't be detected during the autopsy. Since he had volunteered at many hospitals with Yi and was a doctor in the army, he could easily obtain Succi as well. Something that would be much more difficult for Ching-jing and Chih-chung.

When the police also asked Yi's husband where he had been on May 1 prior to returning home and where he had been on May 2 and May 3. He said he didn't remember.

And the letter from him regarding the storage unit. According to Ching-jing, the unit was originally used by Yi to store her personal items like CDs and hats. On April 28, Yi asked the two to renew the lease for her and the two access cards were left in their hands. When Ching-jing's father found out, he angrily demanded that they be handed over to him and forbade the two from ever using the unit themselves.

Last and most certainly not least, Ching-jing only had one card in her possession and none of the items had Ching-jing or Chih-chung's fingerprints on them. But they did bear the prints of Yi's husband. It seemed the two had been telling the truth after all.

The rental car, their phones and cards were also lent to a friend of theirs and he was the one driving the car down south. He also conveniently returned to his homeland so they couldn't contact them. The stun guns and batons they had purchased (which were unused to begin with). The two didn't feel safe as some of the internet cafes were in more rundown parts of town and Ching-jing had been sexually harassed on numerous occasions.

Yet another smoking gun came when handwriting experts compared the letters sent by Yi and her husband to known handwriting samples from both of them. They were a match. So in the face of all of this evidence, how could he have possibly been innocent? Well, he was the victim of an elaborate frame job, all of this evidence had been planted or just made up.

Chih-chung would never confess, all he said was that he would sue the officers for making an illegal arrest. Both also demanded that the police serve them ""high-end burgers"" But they could likely convince Ching-jing to so they interrogated her separately from Chih-chung.

The police hid rotten pig meat in the interrogation room to mimic the sound of decomposition. Then, they turned off all the lights and had a projector display photos of Yi's body. The photos were also accompanied by a soundtrack. The song playing was ""The Only Good Mother in the World""

Once Ching-jing started to get very uncomfortable, that's when the officers for the first time, told someone else about how they had identified the body, via the medium at the temple. One of the officers confronted her directly and said ""Your mother ‚Äòcame back‚Äô crying, but she wouldn‚Äôt tell the nun who killed her. Even in death, she was still protecting you. How can you bear to let her die unjustly and ruin the reputation of the man who accompanied her for decades?""

As mentioned, superstitions still prevail in Taiwan so when she heard the story of her mother's ghost, she believed it and confessed not long after.

On May 1, she and Chih-chung planned on taking Yi to the suburbs of Taipei County to look at a house. They called the family's landline but Yi was busy cooking at the time. Eventually, the two opened the door themselves and upon seeing Chih-chung, Yi erupted into a rage, he was not welcome at their home and she had never been told that Chih-chung would be joining them, or even that the two were still together.

Yi grabbed a knife and Chih-chung rushed to defend himself, he grabbed the knife and managed to get Yi in a headlock with his arm around her neck. This went on for a few minutes until Yi had stopped moving or breathing for that matter. Chih-chung had accidently strangled her to death.

The two panicked before quickly calming down and formulating a plan. They took out the large plastic garbage bag and stuffed Yi's body inside. They then dragged the body out to the driveway and stuffed it into the trunk of their rental before driving off.

As they were driving, Chih-chung suggested leaving behind a note so that Yi's husband would be none the wiser when he finally returned. Ching-jing returned back to the house and wrote the note that was left behind on the coffee table. She knew her mother's handwriting and her own was similar enough to her mother's to effectively mimic it.

Later that night, the two went to a hardware store and purchased some scout ropes and iron wire to secure Yi‚Äôs hands, feet and neck. They then slept in the car and decided to look for a place to dispose of the body when they were well-rested.

On May 2nd, the two drove south along the Taiwan 11 Line, which would take them past Taichung but they still couldn't find an adequate place to dispose of the body. That meant another night sleeping in the car with Yi's body decomposing in the trunk.

Eventually, after looking over some maps, they saw an oceanside cliff on the coast of Hualien County. The cliff hadn't yet been developed into the tourist spot it is today. Therefore, the body could stay there for a long time before anyone noticed and the terrain would make retrieving it very difficult.

They arrived at the cliff on May 3 and once they stopped the car, Chih-chung threw the bag containing Yi's body over the guardrail and watched it tumble to the bottom of the cliff. Then two hurriedly got back into their vehicle and drove off.

Since the weather that May was hot and humid, the car absolutely reeked of decomposition so the two had to drop by a supermarket to by various cleaning supplies and deodorizing products to wash the vehicle.

On May 4, they returned to Taipei to return the car and place all the items into the storage unit. The reason neither had fingerprints was that they had been wearing gloves throughout the whole process. Her father's prints had been planted.

The two then mimicked the handwriting of Ching-jing's father to forge the letters and diaries so they could frame him in case the police ever apprehended them. Ching-jing in her own words. ""My father is satan"" and manipulated Yi into disliking Chih-chung and their relationship. Her father had also at times stopped Yi from sending the two money as the two would both squander it and never pay her back.

While the police did believe that they were the killers, they didn't believe this confession. For starters, according to Ching-jing, Chih-chung had attacked Yi while she was cooking but according to the coroner, she had been killed only 1-2 hours after eating her meal for that day.

The coroner saw no signs of a struggle on Yi's body and yet, according to this confession, Yi had been killed accidentally during a fierce struggle. A glaring contradiction. Another was the fact that there was no bleeding under the skin of her neck, and no fractures in the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, or tracheal cartilage even though Chih-chung had supposedly strangled her with his arms.

Next, according to her confession, the two had bought the ropes and wire after the supposedly accidental murder. And yet, she couldn't remember.

The rather blatant lie led the police to believe murder was always the plan rather than manslaughter. Chih-chung would yet again never confess so Ching-jing became the main focus once more. They confronted her with these discrepancies and questioned her further. On December 22, Ching-jing would offer up a second confession.

After Chih-chung was arrested in late 2011, for his theft, he was fired from his job as a translator while Ching-jing never had a job to begin with. Chih-chung blamed Yi for not accepting their relationship. According to him, the state of their life was because of Yi's ""bad appearance‚Äù and that she ‚Äúcursed her daughter and son-in-law.‚Äù

On December 9, after Ching-jing was released, Chih-chung began his ""brainwashing"". He could tell her that ""Only by eliminating Yi, could they change their fortunes"". Ching-jing actually believed him and decided she would ask Yi to borrow some money. If she agreed to send some, then that'd be the end of it. If she refused, then she would help Chih-chung kill her. The way she saw it, she was simply ""removing an obstacle"".

The fact that Yi sent her the money as a downpayment for her future home with absolutely zero pushback made Ching-jing feel uneasy and also made her doubt Ching-jing. In response, Chih-chung simply asked her to ask her for more.

During the New Year, she asked Yi for an additional 1,000,000 New Taiwanese Dollars to apply for a credit card. She refused which led to an argument. For Ching-jing, she felt that Chih-chung was right after all.

The two decided to hold off on their plan to kill Yi as they still had a decent amount of money to fall back on. By mid-March, they had completely run out of money. Chih-chung suggested that Ching-jing disguise herself as her mother so they could transfer the ownership of the house where her parents lived to Ching-jing. This plan failed to get off the ground as the staff at the housing department saw through the disguise immediately.

On April 20, 2012, they were completely destitute and couldn't even afford to go to the internet cafes. Chih-chung yet again blamed Yi and suggested to Ching-jing in no uncertain terms that they should kill her. He suggested they stun her with an electric rod while in her sleep, smother her and then dispose of her body in Hualien so it'd be harder to trace back to them.

Ching-jing agreed and got to work. Over the next four days, she managed to barely scrape up enough funds to purchase bundles of wire, scout ropes, knives, gloves, and large black trash bags at a wholesale market in Taipei. Then, on the afternoon of April 28, she rented a storage locker to store the items.

On April 30, Ching-jing called the home phone which was picked up by Yi. Rather than hanging up immediately, he stayed on which gave Ching-jing time to time to tell him the lie about house searching. Her actual motive was just to make sure Yi would stay home that day. Once the call had ended, the two went to rent the vehicle.

On May 1, Chih-chung drove Ching-jing to another store to purchase a stun gun and a stun baton.

Later that day, they stopped at a public phone booth so Ching-jing could call Yi and see if she was still home. After confirming that she was home and her father away. She told her mother that there had been a change of plans and that the house searching would occur the next day. This was to give Yi time to sleep.

They then put on their gloves and drove to the family home. Ching-jing used her house key to open the door and let Chih-chung in. Yi was still asleep when they arrived. Chih-chung then used a stun baton to stun Yi in her sleep before placing tape over her mouth and nose. After 10 minutes, she suffocated and passed away right then and there.

Ching-jing then imitated her mother's handwriting to leave the note and then took the couple's identification cards and seals. Chih-chung then took the tape off of her mouth and wrapped the wire around Yi's neck. He then used a pair of handcuffs bought years prior to cuff her hands and feet before wrapping the wire around her wrists and ankles. Once he tied up her limbs, he took off the cuffs and put them in the bag.

The two then stuffed her body in the black garbage bag and then the bag containing her body into one of their suitcases they had back in New Zealand. They then dragged the suitcase away from the house and put it in the trunk of their car. They drove to Fengbin and disposed of Yi's body at the mouth of the Maogong River where it eventually drifted downstream until washing up against the rocks. ¬†

They then returned the rental on May 4 and went to another rental business to rent a different car so they could return to Taipei without arousing any attention. Meanwhile, the stun baton and gun that Ching-jing returned, hadn't been tampered with and truly did go unused. Chih-chung just had his own stun baton.

Meanwhile, when Chih-chung was questioned, he refused to confess, he insisted that Yi was killed by her husband and even said ""The Taiwanese judiciary doesn't have the right to judge me. U.S. congressmen are all my friends..."". He also claimd to be friends with then president Barack Obama and warned the Taiwanese police to ""behave themselves"".

Coaxing a confession out of Chih-chung would be a losing battle. Luckily, they didn't need his confession, Ching-jing's own and the physical evidence were all that they needed.

During the initial court proceedings, Ching-jing would pretend to be mentally ill, claiming that she suffered from schizophrenia and could ""hear hallucinations"" and that an invisible force was controlling her.

Because Ching-jing confessed, implicated Chih-chung and didn't psychically kill her mother with her own two hands she was handed down a life sentence by The Hualien District Court on March 27, 2014. This was considered controversial in Taiwan as many felt she still deserved the death penalty and that life was too lenient a punishment.

[Tsai Ching-jing being escorted to the court room](https://preview.redd.it/ckaotn3a24qe1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb9868f3b0dbc50eb8fa56c2c99abb02935fec80)

This was a sentiment not shared by her father. Even though she played a part in killing his wife and tried to frame him, he was willing to forgive her and pleaded for the court to show her leniency. He placed almost all of the blame onto Chih-chung. Her other relatives were also willing to forgive her.

On May 10, 2014, while in prison, Chih-chung and Ching-jing got married one day before Taiwanese Mother's Day while they were in prison. Then, as husband and wife, they requested to share a cell. Instead, they were held in separate prisons in separate counties. Under Taiwanese law, as Chih-chung would be Yi's son-in-law, even if posthumously, he'd have a legitimate claim to inherit her property upon his release should such an event ever happen.

The head of the team that brought the couple to justice had this to say about their marriage. ""It is not surprising that Tsai Ching-jing would marry the murderer of her mother, as she always obeyed her boyfriend's orders."" Even Ching-jing's father had forgiven her, he refused to bless the marriage and announced that he likely wouldn't be visiting her.

When Tseng Chih-chung was put on trial, he refused to plead guilty and constantly insulted the court and police. He would demand his court-appointed attorney be fired and loudly boasted that he was more knowledgeable on the law than any of the prosecutors or judges. In fact, he accued them of not knowing the law period and often carried into court a book of the six legal codes. For his role in the murder, the court handed down a death sentence by the Hualien High Court, also on March 27.

Ching-jing appealed her sentence but on January 29, 2015, her life sentence found itself upheld.

Chih-chung also appealed his sentence. According to both his and Ching-jing's attornies. Thier sentences should've been mitigated due to their ""mental problems"" so severe that they were unfit to stand trial. They also said that the prior court violated their right to cross examine the witnesses.

On January 27, 2016, Taiwan's Supreme Court ordered the courts in Hualien to conduct a retrial. On February 15, the judges presiding over the retrial cited that ""having had good conduct in high school and college, still had the potential for rehabilitation,"". They also cited his 10 commendations¬†during his mandatory service as another reason for commuting his sentence even though he never once took any responsibility.

This also also odd because the ""good conduct in high school"" would've been almost 30 years before the murder. Many felt that it wouldn't matter regardless but it seemed especially irrelevant here.

[Tseng Chih-chung being escorted to the courtroom](https://preview.redd.it/yfn2u91e24qe1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4f1f679a838ba110e210625797f6c805fe7a1e0)

His new sentence was life imprisonment. In fact, he lied during that same trial. It took place in 2016 and decided to capitalize on the attention a certain Donald Trump was getting ahead of that year's election by claiming that Trump was once his student and that Trump was tutored by him.

Like with his congressmen's comment during his interrogation, he likely said this to make himself seem untouchable. In fact, he said he was friends with two high-profile Americans and ordered the court to subpoena them to testify in his defence. He also warned the court that if his conviction wasn't overturned, some senior American officials would be prosecuting them.

Meanwhile, Ching-jing appealed her sentence once more and on February 3, 2016, the court held a hearing via video link. Her life sentence was upheld for the third time. In response, she ""went berserk"" and loudly screamed ""The judge is breaking the law!"" before the feed was cut off

On February 17, 2016, the police announced that they would appeal against the decision but the sentence was upheld.

During both of their trials, they would continue to accuse Yi's husband of being the killer with Ching-jing even retracting her confession. They even accused the judges, prosecutors and police of taking bribes from him so that they would let ""the real murderer"" go free and cover up the truth. They went so far as to say they witnessed him killing others aside from just Yi, practically accusing him of being a serial killer.

Their behaviour during each and every one of their trials got so annoying, that one of the judges jokingly said ""Court VIP! It's a headache!"" and then spent five minutes complaining about their behaviour

The prosecutor decided he would file additional charges against the two for the libellous statements they had made in court. On May 8, 2017, an additional 6 years were added to their life sentences for making false statements.

While in prison, Chih-chung developed various diseases and rapidly began losing weight. He would ignore the guards trying to treat him as he didn't trust ""Western medicine"" and often refused treatment. Many times he had to be forced to get treatment once it got so bad he could barely move. In the 8 years since his conviction, he was forced to see a doctor 81 times, two of which were under armed guard.

On April 19, 2022, he suddenly began suffering from severe pain all over his body and had to be extracted from the prison to be brought to a hospital by ambulance. The next day, on April 20, Tseng Chih-chung's life came to an end at 59 years old as the result of peritonitis causing multiple organ failure.

The fact this his death occurred exactly 10 years to the day from when he first proposed killing Yi didn't go unnoticed.

Also, this might be a little harder to follow than usual. It's a lot more complicated than I thought it was going to be. Part of that is also because I don't really like naming people who aren't the killer or victim. So there is a lot of ""victim's husband"" ""killer's father"" and so on)

At 1:00 p.m. on May 4, 2012, a fisherman from a small town known as Fengbin in Taiwan's Hualien County, walked along the Huadong Coastal Highway with his fishing gear. As he reached the 49.1-kilometer mark of Provincial Highway 11, he suddenly noticed a bloated dead body washed ashore on the rocks of Taiwan's coastline.

The area was a well-known tourist spot so It tragically, wasn't uncommon for the locals to come across drowning victims. In fact, this very fisherman had found other victims on multiple occasions before this one. Knowing the procedure, he quickly called the police to report the body.

[The area in question](https://preview.redd.it/59z3fe2l04qe1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf1029ccabbc478b92086e5adf9a064940f7a010)

The police and personnel from the Taiwanese Coastguard were quick to arrive and just as quickly, they concluded that the body, which belonged to a woman had been murdered as opposed to drowning. Multiple scouting ropes and iron wires tied around her hands, feet, and neck, if she had drowned, it certainly wasn't accidental. And if she had been killed before entering the water, she was likely killed far away with the ocean currents carrying her to Fengbin.

[Officers inspecting the body.](https://preview.redd.it/50i8246r04qe1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=276958d689d46e0309ff84277b8ec81069e3d15d)

[Coast Guard personal preparing to cover the body](https://preview.redd.it/8daffro314qe1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b65b1a3cfb65321ae17a7bf437543363f1f58f62)

Based on the level of decomposition, they initially believed she had been deceased for approximately two weeks. They also suspected that she might've been raped but that could not be confirmed without a detailed autopsy.

Based on her clothing, they initally theroized that she may have been a hostess at the nearby karaoke bar situated next to the port. Perhaps she had a dispute with a customer which led to her being raped, murdered and thrown into the ocean.

One week later on May 11, the autopsy began, and in the week between the autopsy and her body being found, the victim had remained unidentified. The coroner made the following conclusions.

The woman stood 160 cm tall and had short, undyed hair that had largely fallen out. For her teeth, it was described as ""fixed full-mouth dentures"" on both the upper and lower jaw.

[The dentures.](https://preview.redd.it/0awprw0714qe1.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=84e0128897a24a90e0bc03aa7ff44b9ca59bee2b)

These characteristics led to her age being placed between 40 - 60.

Due to the bloating and decomposition, her body was sadly too degraded for anyone to recognize off of sight alone. However, the medical examiner could use the rate of bloat and decomposition to estimate her time of death to be 3-5 days prior. A far cry from the inital estimate of two weeks. The bloating had simply made her look more decomposed which threw the officers off.

A large amount of food was also found in the trachea, and the stomach contained approximately 200 ml of partially digested semi-solid food. Based on the level of break-up and digestion, she had likely been killed 1-2 hours after consuming it.

While they couldn't recognize her face, the clothing was identified much easier. She was wearing a silk white long-sleeved XXXL sized blouse, a white camisole, a gray bra, black jeans, and light yellow underwear. Unfortunately, that was all the police had to work with. She had no identification or personal effects on her person and her body had no scars, birthmarks or tattoos that one could use to identify her.

As mentioned, her hands and feet were tied with scouting ropes, and her neck was wrapped with steel wire.

[The wire](https://preview.redd.it/ht3u52w814qe1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=b259cea147078af6c5958545cb75e10b31513d51)

The left and right wrists were each wrapped three times with a scouting rope, then tied behind the back with another scouting rope in a figure-eight knot. The left ankle had four loops of scouting rope, while the right ankle had one, which was also secured with another scouting rope.

[The ropes](https://preview.redd.it/6pqebi7a14qe1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c5e0e54996f026c735211c0e84f737a763fb86a)

Determining the cause of death was a real struggle. There were no injuries to her body or any signs of a struggle. No toxic substances were found anywhere in her system, no subcutaneous bleeding in the neck, and no fractures were found in the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, or tracheal cartilage.

Eventually, though, that mystery was solved. The mucous membranes of the oral cavity were darker in colour. This was indicative of asphyxiation due to being smothered. This would've led to respiratory failure after vomit obstructed her airways.

When it came to identifying her, the first action taken was to take her fingerprints. Predictably, due to the degradation from being in the water and decomposing, they could only take incomplete prints. And the partial prints they did manage to lift didn't match anyone in Taiwan's database.

The police then published photos of her clothing in the newspapers and broadcasted them on TV. The head investigator would even display the clothing in public so passerby could view them as they were in person. He had hoped that approach would be more effective in jogging their memories.

[The decedent's clothing being publically displayed.](https://preview.redd.it/acuiwskc14qe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a49372de25ca1b69de78a2ea0324bd9b74fe133f)

The police did get many tips but all of them fell through.

As mentioned above, due to the currents of the North Pacific, the woman could've been murdered far from Fengbin and simply carried over to the town. Therefore, the police didn't just check the local missing person reports but expanded the search throughout northern Taiwan.  She could've been murdered as far south as Hengchun or Pingtung in southwestern Hualien County and drifted northward. Therefore the police focused their inquiries on Pingtung, Taitung, and Hualien. By May 18, two weeks had passed since her body was found and the police were not any closer to identifying her. They decided to expand the search to Yilan but none of their missing women matched the decedent either.

Having investigated for two weeks and having had nothing to show for it, the police began to wonder why nobody reported her missing. They believed she could've lived alone or was maybe a foreigner with no family in Taiwan. By now, the police shifted gears and decided to focus on her clothing to identify her. Specifically, the blouse.

The blouse had the label ""Lanling,"" which was a women's clothing factory in the Banqiao District, of Taipei. The police figured they could contact the factory, be told of their retail distributors and then track the purchase of the blouse from there.

The news they heard was quite disheartening. The blouse was not distinctive even in the slightest. It was a common product that had been sold all across Taiwan in every county. It has also been distributed through just about every single medium possible such as TV commercials, online marketplaces, brick-and-mortar stores, and even traditional markets. Tracking down every single purchase was simply too monumental a task to even consider undertaking.

The only thing the police had left to fall back on was her dentures. Dentures which were once more, not anything special or distinctive. Almost any hospital or dental clinic could've manufactured them. And that wasn't even considering any unlicensed or underground clinic.

Furthermore, those who got these dentures were typically those who lost or severely damaged most of their teeth which made taking traditional dental impressions impossible. The police could've shown the dentures to the dentist who personally made them and they probably still wouldn't know who the owner was.

The police spent about a month inquiring with dental clinics in Pingtung, Taichung, Hualien, and Yilan but didn't turn up any leads at either of them. By June, the investigation had reached a complete dead end.

The captain in charge of the investigation team would routinely re-question businesses they already had in hopes their persistence would finally pay off. Eventually it did, but not how any had expected.

By now, it was July 2012 and not only was the case still unsolved, but they had no leads. Before continuing, it's worth noting that Taiwan is a fairly superstitious society which explains the following course of action.

Three investigators accompanied their captain to Yilan to conduct another round of inquiries, hoping that maybe this time they'd identify her. On their way back, they passed by a temple in Hualien dedicated to a deity. Being a devout believer, the captain and his man decided to visit the temple so they could prey for the deity‚Äôs blessing for a breakthrough in the case.

As they entered the temple, something quite unexpected happened. An attendant/medium at the temple asked ‚ÄúWho is that woman following behind you? Why isn‚Äôt she coming in to pray?‚Äù

The question came as quite a shock to them. It was only dusk, they had all driven in a single car and there were no other visitors in sight. No woman accompanied any of them.

The medium seemed to take note of how baffled they were and elaborated. She said ‚ÄúThat middle-aged woman holding a set of dentures‚Äîshe's bowing to you. Can‚Äôt you see her?‚Äù

They still couldn't see anyone but the team's captain decided to push further, after all, they had come to the temple to begin with. He asked the medium to speak to the woman and ask her name. She conveyed back to them that she was unwilling to say much but admitted that she was the Fengbin Jane Doe, that her surname was Chen, and that she had lived in ""the northern region"". She then thanked the investigators for their efforts before ""vanishing""

The police decided to bring the medium back to the police station with them so she could be questioned further. Even though she had supposedly seen her spirit/ghost, they wanted to make a composite sketch of the victim based on her description. Luckily, she retained a good memory and eyesight and soon a sketch was made based on her description.

[The sketch of the decedent](https://preview.redd.it/jwhjfhpf14qe1.png?width=301&format=png&auto=webp&s=26afdafebe352381439e68947bb7de7f3c3562b3)

A few days later, the Fengbin police went to Taipei with the sketch in hand. They showed it to locals and talked with the local police to see if their Jane Doe's sketch matched any missing persons that they had on file. While there, they also inquired with the dental clinics in Taipei to see if the dentures could be recognized by anyone. They focued on those who had the dentures fitted between July 2011 - May 2012.

The police eventually arrived at an unlicensed dental clinic to show the sketch and the dentures to the workers. They felt the sketch looked familiar but when shown the dentures, they finally identified her as Chen Yi, a long-time patient who lived in Taipei's Beitou District. This was only the third clinic investigated by the police.

[Chen Yi](https://preview.redd.it/o36o9i4i14qe1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=a553efa3909f474753794772fae5b471136056b9)

According to the Taipei police, there was indeed a woman by that name missing. On May 2, 2012, a middle-aged man went to the police to report his wife, 55-year-old Chen Yi missing and that the circumstances were suspicious. But strangely, 9 hours later he went back to the police and withdrew the report. According to him, she was just fine and it was merely a misunderstanding.

Even more strangely, on June 14, he went back to the police to report her missing for a second time. Apparently, she was missing after all.

Yi's husband was a 57-year-old retired military officer while Yi was a full-time homemaker. In the 1990s, they made several real estate investments all of which paid off and netted them a decent amount of wealth. The couple was also known for being good and compassionate, even after they had retired, the two would often volunteer at local hospitals.

The two had two children, one boy and one girl. Their son was diagnosed with leukemia and required constant care while their daughter, born in 1981, was Tsai Ching-jing, was still in elementary school. Ching-jing had to live with her grandmother to make caring for their son easier but sadly, he wouldn't make it. After he passed away, Ching-jing was sent back to live with her parents.

[Tsai Ching-jing](https://preview.redd.it/k9sn73ak14qe1.png?width=455&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a861fbc9da5d63c82cd1602f639ff95091289ef)

After returning home, Ching-jing began developing a rebellious and withdrawn personality. Her grades also suffered. After high school, her family managed to obtain enough money to have her sent down to New Zealand. They had hoped the opportunity to study abroad would work wonders regarding her future prospects. She arrived at the country in 2000.

While in New Zealand, Ching-jing's grades still plummeted, she ranked at the bottom of her class and didn't even graduate. But when she was in New Zealand, she met a man named born in 1962, named Tseng Chih-chung. Chih-chung was an English teacher and self-proclaimed Harvard Graduate.

[Tseng Chih-chung](https://preview.redd.it/w8xqwvyl14qe1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c19b055377fa8d16eae33a0a2978d02948ab728)

Hhe was also older than Ching-jing by 20 years. Despite her parent's objections, Ching-jing began a relationship with him.

While Chih-chung claimed to be a Harvard graduate, he was actually a con artist with a criminal record. He never once attended the institution and he was only a temporary English teacher with a measly salary. Ching-jing still loved Zhih-chung though, enough to stay in New Zealand with him for only 11 years. In those 11 years, she only visited Taiwan twice and often begged her mother to transfer the two money as she was unable to find a job.

On October 29, 2010, the two finally acknowledged reality and accepted that their life in New Zealand wasn't sustainable. Therefore, the two both returned to Taiwan in hopes they'd have better luck obtaining a job in their home country. The two only found themselves working odd jobs and spent most of their days at various internet cafes in Taipei.

While they went to Taiwan to look for a job, they weren't particularly motivated to actually get one. That meant they didn't really have much of an income so to speak and so began their crime spree. On July 24, 2011, the two committed their first robbery. They broke into a store to steal grass jelly, drinks, fruits, and Angus beef.

Then on October 14, they went to another store and stole beef strips, beef chunks, pig head skin, oyster sauce, pig liver, and cooked shrimp, the combined total coming to 1,000 New Taiwan Dollars. Ching-jing was caught by mall security and detained while Chih-chung escaped.

During the arrest, Ching-jing resisted and ended up injuring one of the security guards by knocking him down with her elbow. Ching-jing was swiftly handed down a three-month prison sentence for both thefts while Chih-chung remained on the run. During her trial, she would frequently accuse the guards who detained her of ""sexual harassment"" Her assault charge never saw the courts as the security guard settled out of court.

On November 18, Chih-chung went to a convenience and Watsons store and stole one bowl of braised beef noodles, one box of Salonpas (a patch for muscle strain relief), and one bottle of Deacid-N A (a lotion for relieving shoulder, neck, and waist muscle fatigue and pain). This time he was caught and during the arrest, he did nothing but constantly insult the officers.

The court decided to grant him bail and he was released. When it was time for his and Ching-jing's court dates. They both walked as agonizingly slow as possible just to cause the trial to drag on longer than needed for everyone else. They made a 100-meter walk to the court take 20 minutes.

Even though their sentences were lenient, Chih-chung was still incensed by it. He forged the judge's signature on a 7.2 cm long and 6.9 cm wide note and used this as evidence that he had been demanding bribes. He then used this to file over 24 separate complaints with the prosecutor's office demanding the conviction be overturned. The handwriting did not match the judge's and coincidently, contained several insults directed toward the prosecutor on the case.

On December 9, Ching-jing was released from prison and by then, her parents had enough. Chih-chung was an immensely bad influence leading their daughter down a bad path so after her release, they ordered her to break up with Chih-chung or they'd stop sending her money. When she didn't comply, her father severed all ties with her.

Later that month, Ching-jing finally turned back to her mother. She told Yi that she changed and wanted some money so she could buy a house and live on her own.

Yi always felt guilty and even partially responsible for Ching-jing's position.. So on December 28, she transferred her 300,000 New Taiwan Dollars as a down payment for a house.

In the ensuing months, the two would talk more and more until finally, on April 30, 2012, she called her family home. Ching-jing wanted Yi to join her. She planned on driving down to the outskirts of Taipei County on May 1 so she could look at some potential houses and wanted her mother to join her. She agreed and was proud of her daughter for showing signs of change.

On May 1, Yi's husband was out running an errand and left the house key inside. That meant he couldn't enter their home. He tried knocking on the door but nobody came to let him in. He then called Yi's cellphone only to get an automated message saying ""temporarily unavailable"". He then, albeit reluctantly, dialled Ching-jing and Chih-chung's numbers.

Both of their phones were turned on but neither of the two actually answered. He then called Yi's brother and the two tried reaching Yi for hours before finally going to the police at 12:47 a.m. on May 2 to report her missing.

Together with the police, they returned home and forced the door open. On the coffee table, a handwritten note was left behind which said ""I received a call from a master and need to go help. I‚Äôll be back later, and I may stay overnight. I lost my phone at the market today, and I‚Äôll contact you when I‚Äôm done.""

[The note](https://preview.redd.it/qg9qagjw14qe1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ddbf1fc8a52e65bc8695ec6108af79f0f42856a)

The note was clearly in Yi's handwriting which is why he later went back to the police station on May 3 to withdraw his report.

He spent a week convinced that all was fine and she was just busy with work. He actually did know about the body that washed ashore in Fengbin and his local police tried talking to him about it, they even offered to take him to Hualien himself but he rather impatiently told them the body couldn't belong to Yi as she wasn't even missing and would be back soon.

He then spent the next month and a half on vacation. He joined a travel group and toured various cities in China such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing. He returned in mid-June and was unnerved when Yi wasn't home to greet him. Her phone also remained unavailable and now Ching-jing and Chih-chung's numbers were inactive as well. One of the first things he did upon returning to Taiwan, was to go back to the police station to report Yi missing for a second time.

After speaking with her husband and hearing all of this information, the police soon took samples of Yi's hair from the bathroom and her toothbrush. DNA was taken from both and compared to the body found in Fengbin. A few days later, the results came back, definitively identifying the Fengbin Jane Doe as Chen Yi. She had been unidentified for two months.

Imagine waking up to the gentle sound of waves and the smell of salty sea air. Whether you're a seasoned camper or a novice, the benefits of seaside camping can enhance your outdoor adventures.

### 1. Breathtaking Views

The primary allure of coastal camping is the stunning views. With many campsites located just steps from the shoreline, you can enjoy panoramic vistas of the sea at all times.

These views not only provide a feast for the eyes but also offer incredible opportunities for photography, making memories that last a lifetime.

### 2. Refreshing Breezes

Coastal areas typically enjoy cooler breezes than inland locations, which is especially refreshing during warm summer months. This natural airflow helps keep campsites comfortable, allowing for restful nights where you can sleep peacefully without overheating. A gentle sea breeze also enhances the overall camping experience and connects you more deeply with the environment.

### 3. Access to Water Activities

Staying near the coast opens up a world of water-based activities. Whether you enjoy swimming, kayaking, surfing, or fishing, there‚Äôs no shortage of options.

Children, in particular, love the adventure of camping and exploring the beach.

### 7. Educational Experiences

At first, it looked like another log, half-buried in the marsh, tangled in the reeds and stained black by the putrid water. But then the wind shifted, pulling back a strip of purple fabric, and the search party saw it for what it was.

The first whistle blast cut through the morning stillness, followed by a second, sharp and urgent. It echoed through the woods, and the volunteers close enough to hear abandoned their search grids, running toward the sound.

A boy from Augusta, sixteen or seventeen, was the first to see her. It took a moment for reality to settle in, and when it did, he staggered back, eyes wide and hands covering his mouth. His mother stood beside him. The boy stumbled into her and she wrapped her arms around him. Instinct told her to pull him back, protect him, but the image tugged at them and neither could look away for long.

The girl lay slumped over a fallen tree, her body submerged to the waist in the murky shallows. The prom dress‚Äîsilk, torn, and caked in mud‚Äîclung to her torso. Insects crawled along the pale strip of her arm, her skin marbled with the early signs of decay. Nearby, a silver shoe was caught in the reeds.

A deputy waded in first, breath held, boots sinking deep into the muck. He reached for her wrist, then stopped. No need to check for a pulse. The others stood frozen, silent. The only sound was the buzzing of flies and the distant calls of search teams still sweeping the woods, unaware that it was already over.

Beth Hopkins had been missing for four days.

¬†¬†

# Chapter 1

¬†

It was an old town, and full of memories, not all of them good. As Reid Cooper navigated his SUV down Kingston‚Äôs narrow main street, he couldn‚Äôt think of a single positive thing that had happened there. If any existed, the murder his senior year and everything that followed had pushed them so far down that they might as well have never happened. It was those same events, the ones following Beth‚Äôs death, that had forced him out of town before he‚Äôd even graduated. He never expected to be back.

The phone call came that morning, his mother calling from a retirement village in Florida and the condo she shared with her third husband. Never one for sentimentality‚Äîsomething Cooper found both refreshing and endlessly frustrating‚Äîhis mother broke the news without preamble.

‚ÄúReid, it‚Äôs Mom. Your father is dead.‚Äù

He‚Äôd been drinking coffee and reading the sports section in the *Augusta Register*. Across the kitchen, Leni was rinsing out her mug, already dressed in her doctor‚Äôs scrubs and getting ready for a thirty-six-hour shift on the labor and delivery floor. She stopped what she was doing when Cooper lowered his cup and said, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey found him at home last night. A massive heart attack, apparently. He still had me down as his emergency contact. I can‚Äôt imagine why. They should have called you since you‚Äôre so close. It‚Äôs not like I can do anything from Florida.‚Äù

Leni caught his eye, mouthing w*hat‚Äôs going on?* He waved her away.

‚ÄúWas he sick?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow would I know. Heart attacks don‚Äôt discriminate. It just goes to show you.‚Äù There was a pause, then she added, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to go up there and make the arrangements.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know I can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but there‚Äôs no one else to do it. It has to be you.‚Äù

Cooper had the time. His most recent investigation‚Äîa smash-and-grab gas station robbery that had left the attendant dead‚Äîwas nearly closed and there was nothing new on his desk. But time wasn‚Äôt the issue. He hadn‚Äôt spoken to his father in almost twenty years. They‚Äôd never had much in common to begin with, and Robert Cooper never forgave his son for leaving town to move in with his mother. They were practically strangers, but the news of his death had triggered a tightening in his chest that Cooper couldn‚Äôt quite explain.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise anything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll see what I can do.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good enough for me.‚Äù

His mother hung up and he laid the phone on the table. He finished his coffee in one long gulp.

‚ÄúWhat was that about?‚Äù Leni asked.

When he told her, her face twisted in a complicated expression that Cooper was sure mirrored his own. She knew the broad strokes of his relationship with his father. They‚Äôd been together more than ten years and despite living only three hours away, Leni had never met him. As a rule, Cooper didn‚Äôt talk about him and she knew not to ask.

‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù

Cooper rinsed his coffee cup and set it in the sink next to hers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù he said. That wasn‚Äôt entirely true, and she knew it, but she didn‚Äôt press him.

‚ÄúWill you go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just run off to deal with this. I have responsibilities here. And I‚Äôve got my morning briefing in-‚Äù he checked his watch. ‚ÄúLess than an hour. No, I‚Äôm not going.‚Äù

‚ÄúReid, this is your father. Whatever he might have done or not done, nothing will change that fact. Trust me when I tell you that if you ignore this, or you leave the funeral arrangements to someone you don‚Äôt know, it will eat away at you. And your responsibilities can wait a couple of days. Call the lieutenant and tell him what happened. He‚Äôll understand.‚Äù

Cooper said nothing as she guided him back to the table and put the phone in his hand.

‚ÄúCall him. I have to get to work so let me know what happens. I expect you‚Äôll be there for a couple of days. I can come tomorrow night when I get off if you want me there with you.‚Äù She searched his eyes, reading him, and then kissed him once on the lips and then on the cheek.

‚ÄúThis won‚Äôt take more than a couple of days. That‚Äôs if the lieutenant lets me go.‚Äù

‚ÄúEither way, I‚Äôll see you the day after tomorrow.‚Äù

The lieutenant, it turned out, was not only willing to let Cooper take a few days off, he spoke for several minutes about how he‚Äôd felt when his own father had died four years before. By the time Cooper got off the phone and reluctantly packed a bag, it was nearly nine o‚Äôclock.

Now, he was driving past half-remembered landmarks and glimpsing faces he thought he recognized but couldn‚Äôt be sure. If anyone recognized him, they didn‚Äôt show it‚Äîand that was just as well. Cooper would be there for twenty-four hours, thirty-six, at the most. He had neither the time nor desire to reconnect with anyone in town. Once this business with his father was taken care of, the funeral planned, the paperwork signed, he would be back on the road to Augusta. The service wouldn't take place for a week or more, and if there was a will, its probate and execution could be done by phone or email. There was no reason to stick around.

There were two main roads out of Kingston, one running east past the marsh, the other twisting southwest into New Hampshire. Cooper took the eastern road, passing the town hall with its white steeple and ivory clock face, then the old Lawton market where he used to get gas and Greek wraps on weekends. He drove past the trailer park where he‚Äôd learned to skateboard in middle school and a row of old townhouses where a high school math teacher‚Äîwhose name he couldn‚Äôt remember‚Äîhad lived.

Ahead, the marsh appeared, wide and dark, stretching across the entire eastern edge of town. A flash of purple cloth, caked in mud, flickered into Cooper‚Äôs mind. He blinked it away and turned onto a gravel driveway he hadn't seen in twenty years.

The house was bigger than he remembered‚Äîa rambling colonial with twin chimneys and an ell slanting off the back. For years, his father had done most of the maintenance himself, refusing to pay a contractor for anything but the most complicated repairs. Every spring, Robert Cooper would haul out his extension ladder to patch siding and touch up paint that had weathered the harsh Maine winters. Summers would find him in the yard, cutting grass and trimming trees. The lawn was still neat, even now, but the house had clearly become too much. The paint was peeling, the porch sagged, and sections of siding were missing. Cooper felt a pang of guilt, imagining his father struggling under the weight of the house, alone.

Cooper killed the engine and wandered over to the garage, reluctant to enter the house. The windows were grimy, and inside sat an old truck he didn‚Äôt recognize. He‚Äôd pictured his father still driving the small white Toyota pickup he‚Äôd owned when Cooper left town but that would be impossible. Road salt had a way of wrecking vehicles, and they rarely lasted more than a decade. The Toyota would have gone to the junk yard years ago. But seeing a different vehicle in the garage‚Äîand the condition of the house‚Äîtold him just how much had changed.

For as long as Cooper could remember, his father had kept a spare key hanging on a nail under the porch. As far as he knew, it had never been used and there was no reason to think it would still be there. It could have been moved to a different hiding spot, or his father could have decided a spare key was an unnecessary security risk and gotten rid of it, and what would he do then?

Holding his breath, he slid a hand under the porch and groped along the rough wood. For a moment, he felt nothing, and then his fingers brushed cool metal, and the key slipped off its nail and onto the ground. He picked it up and stared at it. It was the same key, the same house, the same familiar, earthy smell in the air from the marsh, but he couldn‚Äôt help feeling like an intruder. He had grown up in this house. He‚Äôd tried to teach himself the guitar in the little bedroom at the end of the upstairs hall. He‚Äôd had his first kiss in this very driveway the summer he turned thirteen. But he still felt like an outsider.

He stood at the door for a long time, arguing with himself. There was still time to turn around and go home. Someone else could handle the in-person arrangements. He was really only there to sign papers and those could be scanned and signed electronically*.* His mother‚Äôs words echoed in his head, *I‚Äôm sorry but there‚Äôs no one else to do it. It has to be you.* Finally, he unlocked the door and stepped inside, just as he‚Äôd done a thousand times before.

While nobody has ever cared about me in the orthodox church or contacted me, or enjoyed my company in coffee hour, I love the smell of the incense in the church, the hymns, the bells, the iconography, the eucharist, etc. It's all so beautiful to me and make me feel comfortable. I'm super eager, but hesitant to leave. As an autistic person it feels even more difficult to leave because it'll be too much of a huge change for me and I feel like my routine is empty without attending church at all. I've thought about becoming Eastern/Roman Catholic and even looked at some protestant faiths but I'm just struggling. I'm still a Christian and quite frankly can't see myself leaving the faith, and I've tried multiple faiths including witchcraft before eventually coming back to Christianity, but I just can't bring myself to change religions once again.

If you've left Orthodoxy how have you coped with leaving the church? Would it be better for me to just attend for the aesthetic reasons and my love for God, but still acknowledge the churches faults?

Super embarrassed by my situation, high earner but overspending per month and hitting overdraft. This week was a shock when I went through everything in excel, shaking and feeling sick. The reality really hit me.

Finally broke down to my partner, it felt like a huge relief but felt like I was a total letdown and looser for getting myself into this situation.

I was spending on Amazon almost daily stuff that I don‚Äôt really need, Uber eats and lots of coffees out and a total of ¬£1k per month on motoring (finance, warranty insurance and fuel).

I tracked back a few years and noticed my spending increased in early 2020 when my dad was diagnosed with a rare condition and we wasn‚Äôt on speaking terms, 12 months later I was diagnosed with the same condition. For context the condition is 100% likelihood of bowel cancer with mean age of cancer 40, so facing this I went totally carefree. To top this off, my friend and colleague passed away from the same condition last year. 

Anyway today‚Äôs been plenty of walks to think action plans.

I spoke to my car finance, it‚Äôs in equity! Monday, it‚Äôs being sold and exchanged for much cheaper car (¬£300pm all in) saving ¬£700 pm. 

Credit card debt rolled into a new loan saving another ¬£350 a month. 

Targeting 2 years to clear all everything, with RSUs vesting every 6 months. 

First time in a longtime where I feel like I can breath.

It was in my possession from the store to my house, then 5 minutes before I destroyed it. 

I went back to the store to see if I could just buy the vase and they would not sell me just the vase. So, I whipped out another $180 and bought another. 

Now, I have this extra, brand new stem. Can I sell this? Is it worth anything? It does have a screw type connection so matching it will be difficult I'm sure.

1jgrw5c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jgrw5c,Angels-Question,"This question is puzzling and at coffee hour 4 people did not know and are curious for an answer as well:

  
There are different types of Angels like Cherubim, Seraphim, Archangels, and Guardian Angels. Orthodox Christians receive our Guardian Angel at Baptism.¬†There are 9 types, but I can't remember all of the names. 



**So, do all Guardian Angels look like the Icons attached to this post? For contrast there is an Icon of Saint Michael the Archangel.¬†Every depiction of a Guardian Angel looks the same. Are they all the same? In appearance and how they function and interact with us?**



In comparison,¬†there was a Catholic who said that they are given at birth, and they are all different and personally made just for you. That they are ""assigned"" to you and that you should ""try to communicate with your Angel"".¬†It sounds like wrong theology, and couldn't that¬†lead to Prelest, trying to ""contact your Angel""? 



 I only read the ""Guardian Angel Prayer"" in the Morning and Evening, from the 2025 Orthodox Romanian prayer book/calendar book along with the OSB prayers. I remember a Saint (Not the name) saying to a demon that appeared as an Angel ""I am unworthy"" and it disappeared.¬†



Also, the story of the Monk who disobeyed his Father who told him to stay with his brothers at the Monastery instead of going into isolation. Because he wasn't spiritually ready.¬† Out of Pride he left anyways and started to pray. An ""Angel"" appeared and told him ""Do not pray, I will pray for you, and you should read secular books instead"". He worked miracles, would give visitors prophecies, and could recite the Old Testament. However, he would never bring up the New Testament.¬†The others realized he was under the influence of a demon. After the demon was driven out, the Monk had lost the ability to read.

 How awful**! I do not want to be deceived, clarification about Guardian Angels is appreciated. That way I will know. Thank you in advance.**

Let me start off by saying this was pretty darn good. Could have used more chicken for sure, I mean, the Polish have huge chunks of great chicken, while I struggled to find any in this really. 

The peas in the main were....unexpected, based on the title of the dish and certainly lent some of the sweetness this main has. If you do not like sweet bbq sauce or sweet mains, this is not the dish for you. For my midwestern blood, it was just fine.

My silly self ingested the delicious flapjack and nuts before I even remembered to take a picture.

The fruit and nut mix was great but they really need to roast and salt their nuts going forward. British ORPs have some great PB, so I know they know how to roast and salt nuts....come on folks!

Cherry drink was great and so was the coffee!

I'll end this quick review on a note about these rations, as I've seen quite a bit of great discussion on these new Lithuanian lately. 

I think it's a shame these have basically become British ORPs. Trust me, I love ORPs, the tragedy,  from my perspective, is the loss of diversity in rations across the world as more countries seem to moving toward the lowest cost denominator which is not what we should be thinking about for the men and women who serve their countries. They are, in my opinion, entitled to a piece of home and I find it difficult to believe any Lithuanian household had barbecue sauced chicken, potatoes, cheese,  and bacon for dinner last night. 

I am wondering how long it will take before they realize the error of their ways and bring back a more traditional ration experience. I don't even care so much if the sides stay the way they are now, but the mains need to go back to that hearty, homemade aura that so many fell in love with over the years.

Folks, if you have not been blessed enough to have an older green bag Lithuanian ration, I suggest you seek one out and have it. I am holding one myself for future consumption!

Take care folks!

i (23M) have an upcoming trip next week to visit my significant other (23F) who‚Äôs studying in brisbane which got cancelled due to the termination of the 4 year relationship that occurred last week. i am planning on continuing forward my trip since ive wanted to visit australia since i was a kid. i will be in brisbane from 3/28-4/6, but am taking a quick trip down to sydney from 3/31-4/2. i am hoping get some ideas or recommendations for things to do during my time in australia. 

im from the bay area of california in the US and love every physical activity under the sun, i will never turn down an opportunity to get outside. i rock climb, run, hike, and my absolute favorite thing in this world is racing. i was planning on checking out mount panorama and phillips island when im down in sydney and am still looking into racing things to do in brisbane. i also enjoy trying to new foods and beers. (ive already realized that i love vegemite)

i‚Äôve mainly been using r/solotravel to guide me in things to do in australia and have compiled the following major list of things to do:
‚Ä¢ noosa national park hiking
‚Ä¢ gold coast hiking and beaches / bryon bay
‚Ä¢ gallery of modern arts
‚Ä¢ rock climb at urban climb
‚Ä¢ ferry to manly to grab a beer
‚Ä¢ shelly beach
‚Ä¢ coast walk to bondi while in sydney
‚Ä¢ catch a game of something (im not familiar with the sports in australia, sorry! but i love watching a good match)

i don‚Äôt quite know exactly what i‚Äôll do in any of these places, i‚Äôve never solo traveled before and imagine this might be a bit extra difficult due to the circumstances of the break up. i love the idea of reading a book at a coffee shop, going for a swim, or enjoying a cold beer, but i can only do those things for so long in a day. i am a bit anxious about not having things to fill my time. this might be a good place to note that i am a pretty extroverted person, but get anxious in new places. i‚Äôm hoping my extroverted side will come out since i have nothing to lose by interacting with new people! it‚Äôll also be good to note that i‚Äôll have a rental car the entirety of the trip and plan on staying in hotels. 

overall, im really excited to travel to australia and think the time alone will give me time to reflect on my relationship, myself, and my future. im hoping this post doesn‚Äôt come off as silly as i feel writing it lol, let me know if you have any questions or something doesn‚Äôt make sense.

We do not work together in the same team and he is on a higher position than me. Therefore, our chances of interacting are sort of low. However, one day we met in the elevator as we were leaving work and we walked together to the train station. We did not introduce ourselves, but we just kept talking about anything and everything. He sent me a LinkedIn connection right after our conversation and I was surprised to see that he knew my name which sort of gave me hope. And in those moments of delusion, I convinced myself that he may be interested. Next day at work, he completely ignored me. Before our first conversation, I would often catch him glancing at me and we would quite often make eye contact which always intrigued me even more.
I still see him glancing, but I just hate to feed myself lies. Recently he‚Äôs been making some small acts of kindness as in holding the door for me when he sees me and stuff like that, but I‚Äôve become more self-aware and I‚Äôm telling myself that he‚Äôs just being a kind person with common sense. But I don‚Äôt know. He is 100% my type and it sucks to be in the same work environment because there are 1 million reasons why he could be trying to create some distance. First of all he‚Äôs in probation, second of all he‚Äôs in a higher position and third of all I may or may have not sent him a Microsoft teams message regarding a restaurant suggestion - because we were talking about restaurants during our one and only conversation - to which he replied to with ‚Äúawesome, thanks for the tip!‚Äù.
Today, I also saw him talking and walking with a girl outside, who was not a colleague of ours, during lunch break. It‚Äôs safe to say that I did not eat my lunch. Even the coffee tasted like shit.
So, I turn to you, people of Reddit - how cooked am I? And honestly‚Ä¶ what should I even do?

Moved away from Melbourne Australia (home of consistent quality coffee) and realised I‚Äôd need a home set up to get a decent coffee. Bought the top of the line Delonghi La Specialista ( does auto milk froth, cold brew etc.). It‚Äôs super easy to use and has given me some coffees better than I knew were possible. But now I know what good is I find it super unreliable, about 1 in 3 coffees are great but the other two lack cr√®me. I think it‚Äôs the grind and damper, I find there‚Äôs a lot of variation in the amount of coffee that comes out and the pressure of the damper is really ‚Äògeared‚Äô so a little extra pressure mean the coffee is too hard  and then the machine seems to have a pressure safety shut off and just stops.

1- Has anyone else had these issues?

2- Looking at everyone‚Äôs set ups on the thread  I‚Äôm thinking individual machine elements and better control is better than the easy of everything in one machine? I only drink espresso so all of the features of the La Specialista are wasted on me

3- I bought the machine second hand in a good deal so I think I‚Äôll be able to switch up with little cost. What grinder, scale, damper and machine would people recommend for $2-3k, is that a decent budget or will I regret not going a little hire?

Not settled on the second chair, but I definitely want to get a beige one to tone down the rug and also pair it with the first chair.

But now I wonder, which coffee table would suit this aesthetic and color scheme.

FYI: You can find my color concept for my space in the images below

FYI2: As you can see, the chair has a wooden backrest.

Any suggestions appreciated!

Question. I am relatively new to the sub and espresso. I have several months under my belt now and made a recent insignificant change to my workflow that I‚Äôm curious if it is causing my shots to run faster at the same grind size. 

I flared out the needles on my WDT tools. This was a very simple change that hasn‚Äôt changed my workflow at all. The flared WDT does seem to distribute the coffee better and more evenly, hence the thought that it may be contributing to a faster extraction.

Diagnosed bipolar years ago, stayed unmedicated.   
Had no anticipation or knowledge of this, but it appears that NAC has successfully reduced my bipolar disorder to nil.   
Seriously. I'm not in complete hell anymore.    
My vision is clear, my peripheral vision is full, where before my vision was distorting a lot.    
    
I had very dry eyes, contact lenses wearer.   
I'm also on finasteride, which some people say dries the eyes.   
NAC seems to correct this. My eyes are way more tolerable in general.   
My sinuses are completely clear.   
I can breathe better than I can remember in a long, long time.   
   
Chest tightness is gone. Lungs feel better. Breathing feels better. I'm sleeping better.   
All of this past year, when I go to sleep, sinuses clog. Can't breathe through nose well.   
Wake up feeling like I have a hole in my head and a void in my chest; ultimate depression and suicidal ideology.   
    
Last night laying in bed, I had an epiphany.   
I can fucking breathe, and I can breathe so good.   
I slept better than I think I have in a long ass time last night.   
Everything felt better. My positioning.   
Like, I slept like an actual human last night.   
Most of the night I slept on my back.   
I never really do that. I sleep on my side, but it ""felt right"" and good to do this with NAC in my system.   
I slept the entire night.   
I woke up exactly 1 minute before my alarm.   
Odd.   
But I woke up feeling so well rested, alert. Immediately tuned in.   
I realized, the hole in my head feeling was gone. The immense depression and suicidal ideology was gone.   
   
I feel better throughout the day with this stuff in my system.   
It seems impossible to seethe into oblivion like I usually would, being bipolar.   
    
   
I'm 28.  
I started smoking cigs, vaping, smoking weed about 15 years ago. Really consistently for about 12 years.   
I've always been very resilient, I quit smoking cigs like 5 years ago but I still vape nic and I vape cannabis.    
Never been a drinker.   
Don't drink coffee.   
Barely drink sodas.    
No prescriptions, pretty square over here.   
   
Last year, got covid twice, lost sense of smell and taste for 9 months.    
I corrected it with vitamins, tea tree oil and some NAC but I didn't actually know what NAC was doing (buddy gave it to me), so probably never took enough of it.   
    
   
Not gonna lie. I just saw it in my cupboard, remembered ""it's a nootropic"", and just started taking it randomly again last week.   
I read up little by little each day as I kept taking it (this is dumb I know but my God it was the gift that kept giving in this situation), I knew it wasn't gonna be horrible.    
My NAC is the same company that makes my vitamins and I liked them a lot so I said screw it, started taking it.   
The company is Life Extension.   
    
   
I just wanna say, this shit right here.   
This shit is a fucking miracle for somebody like me.   
   
I had the solution to some of my biggest problems right in my cabinet for the whole last year man.   
     
    
This shit is amazing and it's also inducing cessation of nicotine and cannabis use, because it appears that having NAC in my system negates the potency of both. Not entirely. But my cravings are lowering by the day.    
    
    
I'm not out of the woods yet.   
The biggest thing for me is bipolar.   
That shit has been ruining my life.   
SSRI's just knocked me out every time. Couldn't ever do those.  
This shit is fucking perfect, I feel like I've been aging backwards.

\- sometimes nauseous but the other times it's like something is pressing on my throat  
\- my muscles are completely stiff and sometimes there is a feeling of numbness, they crackle, especially in my neck and shoulder, but back also   
\- I am constantly confused, I don't remember things that were told to me before. Last week for example I went to a meeting where I had to walk to get on the bus, but I forgot so much how to get there that I got on a completely different bus  
\- sometimes I get dizzy, but so badly that I have to sit down or I get dizzy for example. 1-1 second per hour   
\- I am constantly exhausted, even after coffee, there are a few hours in my day when I don't feel tired   
\- My body temperature is low (94.6-96.4¬∞F) but I feel that my body is warm, sometimes my body temperature even goes up to 97.7¬∞F, but in a couple of hours it goes back to my normal 94.6-96.4¬∞F  
\- Bloating, very strong, sometimes only my upper stomach, sometimes only my abdomen but sometimes all my stomach. also, sometimes it aches so hard I cry and get a panic attack  
\- Rapid heartbeat from time to time for no apparent reason (I am not in a stressful environment and nothing stressful has happened)

I think I also have period flu these times just because of my body temperature, but I would like to hear yall's opinions and experiences.

I (24M) and my friend (24F) have been talking about how our city has so much potential, yet sometimes feels a bit... well, dry in terms of social activities and meetups. We're tired of scrolling through our phones on weekends and we bet many of you feel the same way!

So we're creating a fun/adventure-loving group to do exciting stuff together!

What we have in mind:
* Board games night
* Badminton sessions
* Padel Tennis (we're obsessed!)
* Weekend picnics
* Late night coffee meetups
* Futsal
* Group runs
* Cycling trips
* ...and plenty more based on what the group enjoys!

The thing is, we want to bring together the right mix of people who are genuinely interested in being active and social. We're looking for reliable people who'll actually show up when they RSVP, contribute positive energy, and help build a solid community.

## How to join:
If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, drop me a DM! I'll ask you 5 quick questions and will let you know within a day if you're in. This is just to make sure no creeps end up being at any of our gatherings.

## First event:
We're kicking things off with an iftar followed by a Padel Tennis session! Date and details will be shared with confirmed members.

Multan has so much untapped potential for community and fun - let's create the kind of social group we've been wishing existed!

1jgrblz,https://www.reddit.com/r/iih/comments/1jgrblz/post_shunt_mood_shift/,Post shunt mood shift?,"In January I finally got my LP shunt surgery, and while I sadly have had some complications they thankfully have more to do with the surgery process itself and almost nothing to do with the shunt itself. I've been paying a lot of attention and appreciating how my eye-sight has improved and my headaches are almost completely gone, and weirdly I've also noticed that my mood is different? I do have bipolar and ADHD and OCD so mood changes aren't out of the ordinary or anything, but I kinda feel like emotions are more intense in good and bad ways, and I've been a lot more driven to do things and regulating my emotions and thinking through problems is actually still easier even though the feelings are much bigger. Food and music and coffee, things I already loved, are better now too! They just feel/taste better, if that makes sense. And overall I feel very in touch with myself in a way I didn't even know I wasn't. I asked my fiance about it and he legit told me that I seem happier and that I've been laughing a lot more, so the shift is def noticeable to people other than myself. 

It's been very interesting, as I hadn't considered that my IIH could be effecting me to the degree of altering the way I perceive the world and like, my personality and emotions, but it seems like that's what's going on. It kinda feels like when I got glasses for the first time, or started my bipolar and ADHD meds. I still do have bad, depressed days but they seem fewer and farther in-between, and nowhere near as bad as my depression used to be, I do still get the occasional headache, my memory doesn't feel like it's improved that much, and I'm tired a lot, but those could all be caused by other conditions? So anyway, I was just wondering, to anyone who got a shunt or just went into remission on their own, did you notice this sort of change?? It could very well be my other medical conditions and treatments(I also recently went up on my OCD meds), but it started after the surgery which was before the med change, so idk. I've just never seen mood and personality changes brought up in relation to IIH and was curious. 

(Also, thank you again to everyone on this subreddit, without your advice and encouragement I never would have been able to get the shunt, and god has it really made my life so much better. Thank you all so much <3)",1,1742590564.0,iih,0,1.0,False

And most of all, I love you because when I‚Äôm with you, everything feels right. Like I‚Äôve found something extraordinary. Like I‚Äôve found home. üíô‚Äù

**1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Anusha**

I never imagined Bangalore would feel so overwhelming. Back in Jaipur, my life was a quiet rhythm‚Äînarrow streets lined with pink sandstone, the chatter of my mother haggling at the market, my father‚Äôs stern voice reciting rules I was never to break. I‚Äôd grown up in a bubble of tradition, my days mapped out by family expectations: study hard, get a degree, marry a nice boy from a good Rajput family. But I had dreams bigger than that bubble could hold. When the email from Accenture arrived‚Äîoffering me a job in their digital marketing team‚ÄîI saw a crack in the wall of my sheltered world. Bangalore, the tech city, the Silicon Valley of India, a place where I could be someone new. I was 23, armed with a marketing degree from Jaipur University, and ready to escape.

Leaving wasn‚Äôt easy. My parents fought me every step of the way. ‚ÄúA girl alone in a strange city?‚Äù my mother cried, her hands wringing the edge of her dupatta. ‚ÄúWhat will people say?‚Äù My father was quieter, his disapproval a heavy silence that weighed on me more than words. But I‚Äôd saved every rupee from my internships, and with the job offer in hand, I booked a train ticket on the Jaipur-Bangalore Express. I told them I‚Äôd be safe, that I‚Äôd live modestly, that I‚Äôd call every day. Lies, mostly, to soothe them. Inside, I was trembling with excitement and terror.

The train ride was 40 hours of clattering tracks and restless sleep. I sat by the window, watching Rajasthan‚Äôs arid plains give way to Maharashtra‚Äôs greener hills, then Karnataka‚Äôs sprawling fields. My small suitcase held my clothes‚Äîkurtis and jeans, a mix of old me and new me‚Äîmy laptop, and a photo of my family I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd look at often. The woman next to me, a middle-aged auntie with a kind smile, asked where I was going. ‚ÄúBangalore,‚Äù I said shyly. ‚ÄúFor work.‚Äù She nodded approvingly, offering me a homemade paratha, and I ate it gratefully, the taste of home grounding me as the train rattled on.

Bangalore hit me like a storm when I stepped off at Yesvantpur Junction on a muggy afternoon in February 2025. The air was thick with humidity, the station buzzing with auto-rickshaws honking, vendors shouting, and a sea of people rushing past. I clutched my suitcase, my heart pounding, and haggled with an auto driver to take me to Koramangala, where I‚Äôd rented a tiny one-bedroom flat I‚Äôd found online. The ride was a blur of traffic‚Äîbikes weaving between cars, the chaotic dance of a city that never slowed. My new home was on a narrow lane off 80 Feet Road, a concrete box with peeling yellow paint, a single window overlooking a dusty street, and a rickety fan that squeaked with every turn. It smelled faintly of damp plaster, but it was mine. I unpacked that night, hanging my kurtis in a cramped wardrobe, setting my laptop on a wobbly table, and lying on the thin mattress, staring at the ceiling. I‚Äôd done it. I was here.

The first week was a whirlwind of settling in. I learned to navigate the city‚ÄîBMTC buses rattling along, Ola cabs when I got lost, and the art of dodging potholes on foot. I bought a steel plate and a gas cylinder from a local shop, cooked dal and rice on a borrowed stove, and burned my fingers twice before I got it right. The flat was lonely, though. No roommates, no family, just me and the hum of the fan. I‚Äôd call my parents every evening, lying about how ‚Äúsafe‚Äù I felt, how I‚Äôd found a ‚Äúnice girls‚Äô PG‚Äù to avoid their questions. They didn‚Äôt need to know I was alone, forging my own path.

Accenture‚Äôs office in Bellandur was a gleaming glass tower, a world away from Jaipur‚Äôs dusty colleges. My first day, March 1st, 2025, I wore a white kurti and jeans, my hair tied back, trying to look confident despite the butterflies in my stomach. The HR team gave me a badge‚ÄîAnusha Chouhan, Associate, Digital Marketing‚Äîand led me to a floor buzzing with activity. Open-plan desks stretched out, screens flickering with data, and voices overlapped in a mix of English, Kannada, and Hindi. The team I joined was small, maybe 15 people, but the sex ratio hit me hard‚Äîonly two other women, both older and aloof. The men were a mix of loud and quiet, some glancing at me curiously, others ignoring me entirely. I felt out of place, a shy girl from a small city dropped into this urban machine.

That‚Äôs when I met Samar Mehra. He was at the desk next to mine, tall and lean, his dark hair a tousled mess like he‚Äôd just rolled out of bed. He wore a black t-shirt with a faded *Naruto* logo, and when he caught me staring at it, he grinned. ‚ÄúFan?‚Äù he asked, his voice warm but casual. I nodded, blushing. ‚ÄúI love *Attack on Titan* too,‚Äù I said softly, and his eyes lit up. ‚ÄúNo way. Levi or Eren?‚Äù ‚ÄúLevi,‚Äù I replied, and he laughed‚Äîa sound that cut through my nerves like a breeze. ‚ÄúGood taste. I‚Äôm Samar, by the way.‚Äù

He was 25, I learned later, a senior associate who‚Äôd been at Accenture for two years. He had this nerdy charm‚Äîalways quoting anime or geeking out about campaigns‚Äîbut there was a quiet confidence to him, a steadiness that made me feel less lost. That first day, he showed me the ropes: how to log into the analytics software, where the coffee machine was, which clients were nightmares. ‚ÄúStick with me,‚Äù he said, half-joking, ‚Äúand you‚Äôll survive this place.‚Äù I smiled, grateful, and something in me unclenched.

Over the next few weeks, Samar became my lifeline. The office was a pressure cooker‚Äîtight deadlines, endless revisions, managers barking orders‚Äîbut he made it bearable. We‚Äôd grab coffee in the pantry, him ranting about a client‚Äôs awful ad copy while I listened, sipping my chai. He‚Äôd tease me about my Jaipur accent, calling me ‚ÄúRani‚Äù like I was some princess, and I‚Äôd roll my eyes but secretly love it. Outside work, Bangalore was still daunting‚Äîcrowded streets, the constant noise‚Äîbut Samar‚Äôs stories about the city helped me see it differently. He‚Äôd talk about hidden cafes in Indiranagar, weekend treks to Nandi Hills, and I‚Äôd listen, wide-eyed, wanting to explore it all.

Then, a month in, my fragile new life shattered. I came home one evening to find a police notice taped to my building‚Äôs gate. The landlord had been arrested‚Äîsome property fraud case‚Äîand the flat was sealed, yellow tape crisscrossing the door. My neighbors, a mix of students and young professionals, milled around, cursing their luck. I stood there, two suitcases at my feet, the humid night air pressing down on me. I couldn‚Äôt go back to Jaipur‚Äîmy parents would see it as failure, proof I couldn‚Äôt handle this life. Panic clawed at me. Where would I go?

Samar was the only person I could think of. We‚Äôd grown close, closer than I‚Äôd expected. He‚Äôd text me memes at night‚ÄîSasuke glaring, captioned ‚Äúme at Monday meetings‚Äù‚Äîand I‚Äôd laugh, feeling less alone. So the next day, in the office pantry, I poured it all out over coffee, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúThe building‚Äôs sealed. I don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù He leaned against the counter, his lean frame relaxed but his eyes sharp, like he was already solving it. ‚ÄúMove in with me,‚Äù he said, simple as that, though something flickered in his gaze‚Äîsomething I couldn‚Äôt name. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking for a flatmate anyway. Two-bedroom in Indiranagar. Just till you sort things out.‚Äù

My stomach twisted. Live with a boy? My parents would disown me if they found out. In Jaipur, even talking to a guy alone raised eyebrows; this was unthinkable. But I had no money for a hotel, no friends to crash with, and the thought of scrambling for another place in this chaotic city overwhelmed me. ‚ÄúTwo months,‚Äù I said, more to myself than him, nodding. ‚ÄúJust two months.‚Äù

That weekend, I moved in. His flat was on the second floor of a quiet building off 100 Feet Road, a stark contrast to my dingy Koramangala hole. It had white walls, wooden floors, and a balcony with a view of treetops. My room was small but clean, with a single bed and a desk; his was across the hall, cluttered with anime posters and a gaming console. He helped me carry my suitcases up, his lean arms flexing under his t-shirt, and I tried not to stare. ‚ÄúMake yourself at home,‚Äù he said, flashing that easy grin, and I felt a flicker of warmth.

Living with him was easier than I‚Äôd feared. The first night, he cooked pasta‚Äîovercooked, but edible‚Äîand we ate on the couch, watching *Attack on Titan*. He‚Äôd pause to debate Levi‚Äôs fighting style, his voice animated, and I‚Äôd laugh, forgetting my worries. We fell into a rhythm: mornings sipping chai while he rambled about work, evenings unwinding with anime or music. He was respectful, giving me space, knocking before entering my room. But there was this pull I couldn‚Äôt ignore‚Äîhis abs peeking under his shirt when he stretched after a long day, the way his fingers brushed mine passing a mug, lingering a second too long. I‚Äôd catch myself staring, my pulse quickening, then look away, cheeks hot.

I‚Äôm shy, new to this city, raised to keep my head down and follow rules. But with Samar, I wanted to break them. I wanted to explore‚Äînot just Bangalore, but him. And that scared me more than anything.

**1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Samar**

She‚Äôs beautiful, Anusha. Shy, with these soft curves and long, wavy hair that drives me crazy. It sneaks up on you‚Äîhow someone can go from a random coworker to someone you can‚Äôt stop thinking about. When she started at Accenture, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. She was the new girl, quiet, always in kurtis that made her look out of place among the jeans-and-tees crowd. I only talked to her because she sat next to me, and I figured I‚Äôd be nice. ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm Samar,‚Äù I said that first day, tossing her a grin. She‚Äôd mumbled her name back, barely meeting my eyes, and I thought, *Okay, shy one. That‚Äôs fine.* But then she said she liked *Attack on Titan*, and suddenly we were arguing about Levi versus Eren over coffee breaks. She had this spark, hidden under all that reserve, and I liked coaxing it out.

It wasn‚Äôt instant, this thing I started feeling. At first, it was just fun‚Äîhaving someone to geek out with, someone who didn‚Äôt roll their eyes when I rambled about anime or campaign metrics. She‚Äôd listen, her lips curving into this small, secret smile, and I‚Äôd catch myself staring a little too long. Her hair would fall over her shoulder when she leaned over her laptop, and I‚Äôd wonder what it‚Äôd feel like to brush it back. Her kurtis hugged her hips in a way that made my throat dry, but I‚Äôd shake it off. She was my work buddy, nothing more. I wasn‚Äôt some creep who hits on the new girl.

But then she moved in, and everything shifted. That day in the pantry, when she told me about her flat being sealed, her voice trembled, and I saw how lost she looked‚Äîbig eyes, hands twisting the edge of her dupatta. ‚ÄúMove in with me,‚Äù I said, like it was no big deal, but my pulse spiked when she nodded. I told myself it was temporary, practical‚Äîtwo months, she‚Äôd said. I‚Äôd been wanting a flatmate anyway; my two-bedroom in Indiranagar was too quiet since my old buddy moved out. But having her there changed the air in the place.

The first night, I cooked pasta‚Äîovercooked it, really‚Äîand we ate on the couch, watching *Attack on Titan*. She laughed at my terrible sauce, and I felt this weird warmth in my chest. She‚Äôd sit cross-legged in her pajamas, her hair loose, and I‚Äôd notice things: the curve of her neck, the way her fingers tapped the remote when she got nervous during a tense scene. I‚Äôd stretch out, pretending to be casual, but my shirt would ride up, and I‚Äôd catch her glancing at my abs before looking away, cheeks pink. It was torture, those little moments. I‚Äôd lie awake at night, her door just across the hall, imagining her asleep, wondering if she ever thought about me like that. But I kept it locked down. She was from this conservative family‚ÄîJaipur, tradition, all that. I didn‚Äôt want to mess her up, didn‚Äôt want to be the guy who pushed her into something she‚Äôd regret.

Weeks passed, and it got harder. I‚Äôd make her chai in the mornings, and she‚Äôd thank me with that shy smile, her fingers brushing mine when I handed her the mug. I‚Äôd feel a jolt, every damn time, and have to turn away, busying myself with dishes so she wouldn‚Äôt see my jaw clench. At work, I‚Äôd watch her bite her lip over a tricky campaign, and I‚Äôd want to lean over and‚Äîfuck, I‚Äôd stop myself, focus on my screen. I liked her, more than I should. Her laugh, her quiet strength, the way she was opening up to this city, to me. But I couldn‚Äôt tell her. She‚Äôd made it clear her family was everything, and I wasn‚Äôt about to put her in some moral crisis. So I swallowed it, kept it friendly, kept it safe.

Then came that long weekend in late March 2025. Bangalore turned into a monsoon mess‚Äîheavy rain pounding the streets, flooding the roads, the kind of weather that traps you inside. It was a Friday, a holiday tacked onto the weekend, and we were stuck in the flat. The power went out around noon, a loud pop from the transformer outside, and everything died‚Äîno lights, no Wi-Fi, no TV. My phone battery was at 10%, hers wasn‚Äôt much better, and the rain drummed against the windows like it‚Äôd never stop. ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I muttered, slumping on the couch. ‚ÄúNo *Demon Slayer* marathon for us.‚Äù

Anusha wandered out of her room, her hair in a messy bun, wearing a loose t-shirt and those soft pajama pants that clung to her legs. ‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù she asked, her voice light but restless. I shrugged, tossing my dead controller aside. ‚ÄúStare at the walls, I guess.‚Äù We tried cards, but we only had half a deck from some old game night. We cooked Maggi on the gas stove, ate it in silence as the rain roared, and by evening, boredom had us pacing. The flat felt smaller, the air thick with humidity and something else I couldn‚Äôt name.

Around 8 p.m., with the sky dark and the rain still relentless, she lit a candle in her room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs creepy out there,‚Äù she said, nodding at the shadowy living room. I followed her in, the flickering light casting soft glows on her face. Her room smelled like her‚Äîjasmine from some lotion she used‚Äîand I leaned against the wall, trying not to stare. She sat on the bed, the candle on her desk, and after a beat, she looked at me. ‚ÄúDo you wanna play Truth or Dare?‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow, smirking. ‚ÄúSure. I‚Äôve got nothing else to do anyway.‚Äù She grinned, a little nervous, and we started. It was generic at first‚Äîdumb stuff. ‚ÄúTruth,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúFavorite food?‚Äù ‚ÄúPizza,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúYou?‚Äù ‚ÄúRajma chawal,‚Äù she said, and I laughed. Then she picked dare, and I told her to sing something. Her voice was shaky but sweet, some old Hindi song, and I clapped when she finished, her cheeks red.

The game rolled on, the candle flickering, the rain a steady hum. I wanted to know more, wanted to dig deeper, so I went for it. ‚ÄúTruth,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDo you have a boyfriend?‚Äù I asked, keeping my tone casual, but my chest tightened waiting for her answer. She blinked, then laughed softly. ‚ÄúIf I had one, don‚Äôt you think I‚Äôd have talked to him in the last month? Have you seen me on the phone with anyone?‚Äù Fair point. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, grinning. ‚ÄúGuess you‚Äôre too busy staring at me.‚Äù

Her turn. ‚ÄúTruth,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDo you have a girlfriend?‚Äù ‚ÄúNope,‚Äù I replied, easy. She tilted her head, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúDo you like someone?‚Äù Shit. My heart thudded, but I couldn‚Äôt lie‚Äînot with her looking at me like that. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, voice low. ‚ÄúSame question.‚Äù She hesitated, then nodded. ‚ÄúYes. But I can‚Äôt get involved with him. My parents wouldn‚Äôt allow it. They don‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm living here with you.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho is he?‚Äù I pressed, leaning closer, the air between us crackling. She shook her head. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you that.‚Äù

I knew it was me. I‚Äôd seen it‚Äîhow she‚Äôd stare when she thought I wasn‚Äôt looking, her eyes lingering on my chest when I stretched, the way she‚Äôd blush when I teased her. And God, I liked her too‚Äîhad for weeks, maybe since that first pasta night. But she‚Äôd just said it: her family came first. I couldn‚Äôt put her in that spot, couldn‚Äôt make her choose. So I swallowed it again, moved on. ‚ÄúTruth,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAre you a virgin?‚Äù She froze, then mumbled, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna answer.‚Äù I smirked. ‚ÄúCome on, rules are rules.‚Äù She sighed, cheeks flaming. ‚ÄúYes. You?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, me too,‚Äù I said, honest, and her eyes widened.

‚ÄúDare,‚Äù I said next, testing the waters. She bit her lip. ‚ÄúDo you ever wanna kiss someone?‚Äù I asked, breaking the one-question rule, my voice rough. Her breath hitched. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I leaned in, heart slamming against my ribs. ‚ÄúI dare you to kiss me.‚Äù She froze, fear flashing in her eyes, and I backpedaled fast. ‚ÄúSorry, forget it,‚Äù I said, but then she grabbed my shirt, pulled me close, and kissed me.

Her lips were soft, tentative, then fierce, her tongue melting into mine. A shockwave ripped through me, my cock hardening against my jeans as I pulled her onto my lap. Twenty seconds of pure heat, then she pulled back, breathless. I wanted more‚Äîfuck, I wanted it to last forever‚Äîbut she looked scared again. ‚ÄúDo you wanna change that virgin tag?‚Äù I asked, half-joking, but her face tightened. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean‚ÄîI mean, you don‚Äôt have to,‚Äù I said quickly. She shook her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I want to, but‚Ä¶ what if my parents found out?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow would they?‚Äù I countered. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt even know you‚Äôre here with me.‚Äù She went quiet, the candlelight dancing in her eyes.

Awkward silence stretched between us, thick and heavy, like the humid air trapped in her candlelit bedroom. The rain battered the windows outside, a relentless drumbeat that mirrored the thudding in my chest. I‚Äôd pushed too far, I knew it‚Äîasking her about changing her virgin tag, letting my desire slip out like that. Her confession hung there, fragile and unspoken, and I scrambled to pull us back to safer ground. I shifted on the bed, the mattress creaking under me, and rubbed the back of my neck, forcing a casual tone. ‚ÄúOkay, truth‚Äîwhat do you wanna do in three years? Same company or switch?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer right away. Her eyes, dark and wide in the flickering light, stayed fixed on the candle flame, her lips parted slightly like she was wrestling with something. I watched her chest rise and fall under her t-shirt, the soft outline of her breasts pressing against the fabric, and my cock twitched despite my best efforts to stay cool. Finally, she whispered, ‚ÄúYes, I want to do‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice was so soft, barely a breath, that I leaned closer, my knee brushing hers on the bed. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, my throat dry.

‚ÄúI want to try sex,‚Äù she said, the words so faint I almost missed them. My brain short-circuited, a jolt of heat shooting straight to my groin. Did she just‚Äî? I stared at her, her messy bun unraveling, strands of wavy hair falling across her flushed cheeks. Those firm breasts strained against her shirt, nipples faintly visible now that I was looking‚Äîreally looking‚Äîand I couldn‚Äôt unsee it. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I managed, my voice rough, barely holding it together as my cock stiffened against my jeans.

I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. I leaned in, slow at first, giving her a chance to pull back, but she didn‚Äôt. My lips found hers, no hesitation this time, and it was like a dam breaking. Her mouth was soft, warm, parting under mine as my tongue slid in, tasting her‚Äîsweet, a hint of the wine from earlier, and something uniquely her. She melted into me, a small whimper escaping her throat, and I deepened the kiss, my hands sliding to her waist, pulling her closer until her chest pressed against mine. Our tongues danced, slick and hungry, and I felt her shiver as I sucked gently on her lower lip, tugging it between my teeth before diving back in.

I broke away, breathless, and moved to her neck. My lips grazed her skin, soft and smooth, and I sucked at her collarbone, feeling the tremor that ran through her. She tilted her head back, exposing more of that delicate curve, and I nipped lightly, tasting salt and jasmine, her scent filling my lungs. My hands, restless now, slipped under her t-shirt, fingers brushing the warm skin of her stomach. She tensed for a second, then relaxed as I slid the fabric up, inch by inch, revealing the dip of her waist, the swell of her ribs. I pulled it over her head, tossing it aside, and she sat there, her breasts spilling from a lacy black bra, the candlelight painting shadows across her curves.

I froze, just taking her in. Her breasts were full, round, straining against the lace, her nipples dark and hard beneath the thin fabric. My cock throbbed, painfully hard now, and I yanked off my shirt in one quick motion, needing to feel her skin against mine. My chest heaved as I reached for her bra, my fingers trembling but determined. I‚Äôd seen a hundred memes about unhooking bras‚Äîtricks with two fingers, push and pull‚Äîand I wasn‚Äôt about to fumble this. I slid my hands behind her, found the clasp, and pressed my fingers together, popping it open on the first try. She chuckled, a soft, surprised sound, and I grinned, proud as hell. ‚ÄúImpressed?‚Äù I teased, and she nodded, her eyes sparkling.

The bra fell away, and fuck, she was gorgeous. Her breasts were perfect‚Äîtight, firm, sitting high without any support, the kind of natural beauty that didn‚Äôt need a damn thing. Her nipples were stiff, begging to be touched, and I couldn‚Äôt resist. I leaned in, kissing her neck again, slow and deliberate, then trailed my lips down, brushing the valley between her breasts. Her skin was velvet-soft, warm under my mouth, and I flicked my tongue over one nipple, feeling it harden even more. She gasped, her hands gripping my shoulders, nails digging in as I sucked gently, rolling the bud between my lips. Her moan was low, raw, and it sent a surge of heat straight to my groin.

I eased her back onto the bed, her hair fanning out on the pillow, and kissed my way down her body. My lips lingered on her stomach, tracing the gentle curve above her navel, sucking lightly until she squirmed. My hands found her pajamas, soft cotton that hugged her hips, and I tugged them down, inch by inch, revealing the smooth expanse of her thighs. They trembled under my touch, and I kissed them‚Äîfirst the left, then the right‚Äîmy stubble grazing her skin as I worked my way up. Her panty was next, a simple white cotton thing, but it was damp, clinging to her, the outline of her arousal stark in the candlelight. I hooked my fingers under the waistband and peeled it off, slow and deliberate, watching her breath hitch as the cool air hit her.

She was bare now, completely exposed, and I couldn‚Äôt look away. Her pussy was glistening, swollen with need, her clit peeking out, begging for attention. I kissed her inner thigh again, so close I could feel the heat radiating from her, and she jolted, a soft ‚ÄúSamar‚Ä¶‚Äù escaping her lips. I pressed my lips to her clit, just a light kiss, and she moaned, her hips bucking slightly. ‚ÄúDo it again,‚Äù she pleaded, her voice thick with want. I teased her instead, blowing a warm breath over her sensitive skin, watching her squirm. ‚ÄúSamar, kiss it,‚Äù she begged, desperate now, and I smirked, loving how she unraveled for me.

‚ÄúFirst, tell me who you like,‚Äù I said, my voice low, playful but edged with need. She groaned, frustrated. ‚ÄúNo, I won‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúThen no orgasm,‚Äù I teased, pulling back slightly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre crazy,‚Äù she snapped, her eyes flashing, then she sighed, defeated. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you, idiot. Now do it.‚Äù That confession hit me like a punch, igniting something primal. I kissed her clit hard, sucking it between my lips, then licked‚Äîlong, slow strokes, tasting her, salty and sweet and so fucking wet. She nearly came, her thighs clamping around my head, but I stopped, pulling back just to mess with her.

Her glare was murderous, her chest heaving. ‚ÄúDid I say stop?‚Äù she huffed, her voice sharp. ‚ÄúNo edging, Samar. Make it good.‚Äù I grinned, brushing her messy hair aside, tucking it behind her ear with a tenderness that belied the heat between us. ‚ÄúLeave it to me,‚Äù I murmured, kissing her again, deep and slow, letting her taste herself on my tongue. Then I stood, stripping off my jeans, my cock springing free‚Äîthick, hard, aching to be inside her. It pulsed in the air, precum beading at the tip, but I held back. This was her first time‚Äîmine too‚Äîand I wanted it to be fucking perfect, not some rushed mess.

She stared at me, eyes wide, taking in my body‚Äîmy lean chest, the abs I‚Äôd worked for, my erection straining toward her. I knelt back on the bed, pressing my thumb to her clit, massaging in slow circles. She moaned, loud and unrestrained, her nails digging into the sheets as I slid one finger inside her. She was tight, so tight, but so wet there was no resistance‚Äîjust a slick, warm grip that made my cock throb harder. I licked her slit again, my tongue flat and firm, tasting her deeper as I worked my finger in and out, curling it slightly to find that spot. Her hips bucked, her breath ragged, and I cupped her breast with my free hand, squeezing gently, then pinching her nipple between my fingers.

She came hard, her whole body seizing, a sharp cry tearing from her throat as her walls clenched around my finger, pulsing with her release. I didn‚Äôt stop‚Äîkept licking, kept massaging, drawing it out until she was trembling, oversensitive. Then I slid my tongue inside her, deeper this time, exploring her, the salty-sour taste flooding my mouth as I fucked her with slow, deliberate thrusts. She gasped, her hands flying to my hair, tugging as she came again, faster this time, her juices coating my chin. I pulled back, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand, and looked up at her, grinning. ‚ÄúLike it?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she breathed, her voice shaky, her eyes glazed with pleasure. ‚ÄúWait for more,‚Äù I promised, and she smiled.",0,1742590051.0,DestructiveReaders,2,0.5,False

But I was reading great things about it helping cognitive ability, which my mom really suffers in that. Also her voices and delusions have been really bad lately.

1jgqxv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jgqxv1/my_31m_partners_30m_clingy_friend_27m_is_making/,My [31M] partner's [30M] clingy friend [27m] is making me uncomfortable. How do I bring this up?,"Hi, obvious throwaway. English is not my first language and this just happened so it might be a little cloudy cause I'm still weirded out. ( I tried to post this earlier from another account but I had the name wrong, I'm sorry :( )

I \[31M\] have been living with my partner Jake (fake name) \[30M\] for two years now. We get along well, have found things around the house we both like to do and split the rest of the chores, we visit each others family for the holidays, have cookouts with friends‚Äî the whole package. My partner's former roommate (from before we moved in together), let's call him Paul \[27M\] has always been a very clingy type of person, and has struggled with depression for a good part of his adult life. I think Paul is a good guy, but I do not enjoy spending long periods of time with him, as his personality brings me back to darker periods of my life. To sum it all up in few words, he'll always bring down the vibe in the room and make everyone uncomfortable. I have commented this to my partner and we've agreed I shouldn't spend much time around Paul if I don't want to‚Äî we'll still see each other at cookouts or going to the movies but if he invites us over for a weekend trip I'll decline. Paul has recently found a partner of his own, let's call him Mike \[30M\], and he is a doctor (important-ish).

So a couple months ago, Paul had a bad case of man-flu and was down for a week. He asked my partner to go keep him company and help him with medical stuff instead of asking his boyfriend, a licensed physician that did go to medical school. Paul has been increasingly more insistent on taking us for weekend trips and I'll always decline, so my partner's has offered to go on his own. It's important to mention that while I'm comfortable with Paul knowing I don't want to spend that much time with him (Or many people, really. I have an annoyingly low social battery), my partner is always making different excuses for why I can't come. I'm not too fond of him lying in my behalf.

About a month ago, Jake was in a zoom meeting in our home and, since he was in the office space, I went to our tv room to play some games while he was done and we could later discuss what we were having for dinner. Not one hour later, Paul was standing on my tv room's door, as he walked into our apartment unannounced. It is important to mention we live in a gated community so he somehow got past security or they just didn't let us know we had visitors. I was taken aback but didn't mention anything to Paul, as he said he was bringing some important documents to my partner that his own boyfriend had sent him (some medical certificate or something, I didn't ask but it was mentioned). I thanked him and later brought it up to Jake, asking him to please set some boundaries with Paul (or I'd do it myself), as he didn't know whether either of us was home, if we were naked, having sex, had someone over or whatever‚Äî one just does not step into someone's home without at least knocking, to what Jake agreed and said he'd talk to him.

There was even a conversation once where Paul confessed that the only people that'd benefit from his life insurance was my partner. Not his own boyfriend, not his brothers or his mom‚Äî only Jake.

Fast forward to today. Paul showed up to my partner's place of work to bring him coffee, something he has never done before, and knowing well that Jake has a problem with certain public displays of public affection in the workplace, as he likes to appear extreeeemely professional to his clients. (i.e. I only send him coffee, food or snacks, or even things he forgot, through delivery services), gave him a hug in front of everyone, and left. Jake later called me to let me know Paul had shown up to his work and said he thought it was very weird of him to do that and wanted my opinion on it, so I said I'd talk to him later about it as even now I'm struggling to wrap my head around the situation.

I think Jake should set up some boundaries with Paul for the sake of our relationship, cause people have said they look more like a couple than we do. Like, I don't want him to stop hanging with his friend or going out, but I'm getting weirded out by how extremely present he is in our lives atm. My question is, How do I bring this up with Jake without coming off as too harsh insensitive?",2,1742589581.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

anyway, now she‚Äôs home and sober. she‚Äôs fucking obsessed with me. she won‚Äôt leave me alone. i open my bedroom door and she texts me. i pee in the middle of the night and she comes out of her room. i go to take a shower and she‚Äôs knocking on the door. i leave the house and she texts me sad faces. she won‚Äôt do certain things without me. she asks me questions like ‚Äúdo you wanna drink coffee with me‚Äù LIKE NO DRINK IT BY YOURSELF YOURE 24. she‚Äôs totally dependent on me. i have things to do. i have friends. i get that she has nothing, but that‚Äôs not my fault and not my responsibility. i can‚Äôt handle her being this dependent on me.

i tried talking to my dad about it but he literally just rolled his eyes over and over at me. like fine, how about you deal with your every fucking move being tracked. every time i tell her i‚Äôm going somewhere she tries to guilt me into staying home. like we‚Äôre adults, leave me alone.",2,1742589197.0,AlAnon,3,1.0,False

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**

$2,000 USD.  I have some wiggle room if the value is there.

* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**

No

* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**

Needs to be Windows for compatibility with work>Good battery life>reliable/good performance.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**

Prefer lighter weight because I will be carrying it frequently moving around (but battery life and reliability are a higher priority)

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

N/A (maybe less than 17 inches to reduce bulk)

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**

None of these.  Mainly using it to access electronic medical records and look up information online (speed is important).

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

No gaming.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

Reliable build quality is important (if there is a ""Toyota"" of laptops).  Not sure if there is anything like this, but if the keyboard can be spill-resistant (I tend to spill coffee occasionally).  Touch screen would be nice if it does not cause lagging.  No foreseeable need for optical drive or finger print reader.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

Main thing is wanting to make sure it is reliable with a long battery life (shifts can be up to 10 hrs long, and while I will charge in-between, sometimes it gets insanely busy to where I cannot charge and end up having to dim the screen to barely make it).  Reliable hardware is important.",1,1742589182.0,SuggestALaptop,3,1.0,False

Whether you're hosting a summer barbecue or enjoying a quiet evening under the stars, a well-designed 4 piece patio furniture set provides comfort and style.

One of the significant advantages of a 4 piece patio furniture set is its variety of materials.

Setting up your 4 piece patio furniture set isn't just about placing it outside. You can create a cozy atmosphere with the right accessories.

1jgqn59,https://baizaar.tools/banishing-burnout-a-todoist-guide/,How I automated my way out of burnout using IFTTT + Todoist,"Last year I hit a breaking point with productivity burnout. After cycling through countless apps and systems, I realized the solution wasn't just finding the right tool‚Äîit was automating the tedious parts of task management while aligning work with my natural energy patterns. IFTTT became the secret weapon in my productivity arsenal when paired with Todoist. Here's how I set up automation to reduce cognitive load and prevent burnout:

# My IFTTT + Todoist automation system:

   * **Energy-based task sorting**: Created applets that automatically label incoming tasks as ""@high\_energy"" or ""@low\_energy"" based on keywords in the task description
   * **Time-based task triggering**: Set up IFTTT to move specific tasks into my Today view only during my peak productivity hours (8am-11am for creative work)
   * **Context-aware notifications**: Configured location-based triggers that surface relevant tasks when I arrive at specific locations (home office = deep work, coffee shop = writing tasks)
   * **Self-care automation**: Created recurring wellness triggers that can't be snoozed‚Äîwhen my fitness tracker shows elevated stress, IFTTT automatically adds a break to my Todoist
   * **Digital decluttering**: Set up weekly applets that clear completed tasks, archive old projects, and prepare a ""weekly review"" template every Sunday at 7pm

The game-changer was automating the decision-making around *when* to work on *what*. For example, an applet monitors my calendar, and if I've had more than 3 hours of meetings, it automatically reschedules any high-focus tasks to the next morning when I'm refreshed. I've documented my complete IFTTT + Todoist automation setup here: [Banishing Burnout: A Practical Guide](https://baizaar.tools/banishing-burnout-a-todoist-guide/)

I (36F) have been talking to a guy (33M) for close to two weeks. A few days after we first matched, we made tentative plans to meet that weekend. He said he would let me know ""closer to the day"". But it's on the day of that he tells me he can't make it.

So we reschedule to the following weekend, and he tells me his schedule should be ""much better"". We plan to meet on Friday for a coffee date. But he hasn't told me a time or place...just left it kind of vague (let's meet halfway).

Friday comes and it's not until that afternoon that he tells me he can't make it.

I just find it pretty inconsiderate that he left me hanging most of the day only to tell me he couldn't make it.

This isn't my first rodeo, I know when a man is not serious, but still frustrating to go through it.

1jgqhbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/lordofheroes/comments/1jgqhbe/so_im_running_a_loh_inspired_campaing_update_4/,So I'm running a LoH inspired Campaing UPDATE 4,"Wow we had a long break in our sessions. We just couldn't manage to schedule another session for the life in us.

So yeah, we wrapped the situation in Lumisade up. Before we even began the campaing, things weren't smooth sailing at all. 

 For further context, here are the party members and their real life names. I say real life, but I am giving them nicknames here in this post.

""Kai"", a Packt of the Fiend Warlock, High Elf.

""Mike"", a Paladin (Oath of the Watchers), Aasimar.

""Julie"", a Ranger, (female) drow.

""Reid"", a Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer, Dragonborn. 

Now, Reid and I were traveling to our meeting place, Mike and Julie were hosting the game in their home, together but we made a wrong turn or five so we arrived around half an hour too late. Fun.

Once we were finally there we spent some time catching up. It's been quite a while since we last met up. Afterwards we wrapped the situation in Lumisade up. Multiclass ideas were also thrown around again and Mike got Laphlaes to agree to teach him as an Artificer.
Now, I gave them a condition that Laphlaes was busy cleaning up the mess that was left behinde with the Brainwashing shit, so Mike will have to either wait a while for Laphlaes to teach him, or find Rashad in Lunaris as an alternative teacher.

As for Rashad, he is currently in Lunaris because the Seal was breaking and he found it an intresting research opertunity while he helps keep that seal intact with Lumi.
(I needed a reason why Rashad wasn't present in Lumisade for the whole shitshow)

Somewhere in there Reid obtained clearance to technically enter the 3rd Tower after rolling high enough Pursasion check against Laphlaes but they got a ride from Lord to Avillon before they could break into the mainframe of the drones or something. 

Avillon is nation 3 and probably the next target for controlled chaos. Reid has the motivation to somehow become a full dragon, and tries to search for a dragon to help him in that. I gave them the info that they would either need to find Syphfride, who is wandering around the world, or the missing Guardian Dragon of Avillon. Guess what they went with.

So Reid is searching for Avillon's dragon, Mike and Kai somehow got the idea to become god and Julie just sits there and nods along and goes along with their antics.

In Avillon they beelined for the capital, and entered the citadel. I made the citadel into a semi public building, with only certain areas being off limits because staff and Lord live there. In the citadel, I gave them the origin story of Avillon, from which Reid clued into the fact that he could try and track down Cannae for infos on Avillon, namesake of the nation and it's founding King. While Reid went on a dragon or fairy hunt, Mike, Kai and Julie were inthe public library of the citadel and searched for books on artificing or something. They had me try and come up with entire schematics on the fly üòë.

Reid eventually found the apple tree in the citadel where the Guardian Dragon founded Avillon around, and yelled until Cannae showed up to see what the ruckus was. The next hour or so were spent with Reid wording his questions a little too bad for Cannae to not laugh at him. She sat on a branch of the apple tree, munched and apple or two and yeeted another at Reid when she got bored.

I then gave Reid the small tip that Cannae could be bribed by cake, so Reid went into the city and into a Cake shop and caf√©, which was the spot Johan made a cameo sipping a coffee in his break. A apple cake and some cupcakes were purchased by Reid and he duped Cannae with said cake. Like, Cannae tried to land head first in the cake she wanted so badly, Reid had a successful Dexterity Check and pulled the cake away before a firefly sized fairy could land in it and she instead flew into the ground. Not that it stopped Cannae from getting back up soon after to demand the cake. A bit negotiation later, Reid got the info that Avillon was till in the citadell and Cannae got the cake. Now, a failed insight check later, I informed Reid that he doesn't know whether or not Cannae lied to him, or if she just gave a insufficent answer. For all he knows, 'Avillon' ould just refer to the skeleton of said dragon somewhere in the citadel.

At the very same time, the other three decided that they should explore the citadel, and made their way into the audience chamber, and since they all obviously heard me talk to Reid about everything mentioned in the paragraph above, they immideatly began suspecting the statue of the Guardian Dragon around the throne. A intresting suspicioun they had, and I might use that in another session. Who knows üôÇ? After that the three left the citadel without Reid, who was busy trying to send a message to Lord, who was stuck drowing in paperwork in her office, to inquire about the dragon. The three went to the marketplace, Kai began asking about where the economic center was, idk how to translate what he said (we all speak german as our native language, and english as secondary language in various degrees of proficencies). Just picture wall street, he was asking about wall street of Avillon. 

(Kai is the person in the group who is for some reason always informed about politics and knows the most about investing and such.)

And that's where we somehow got entangled in several parallel going discussions about politics, our plans about apprenticeships ect. I was talking with Reid about apprenticeship related stuff while Mike, Julie and Kai were talking about God and the World.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, Reid failed to get a message to Lord right away, but did encounter Rouin in person. Needless to say, the two draconic sorcerers were a bit suspicious of one another.

1jgqdgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1jgqdgz/thinking_about_the_importance_of_networking_and/,Thinking about the importance of networking and film societies/associations,"Hey filmmakers. I'm that guy who [posted a couple weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1j5zi58/my_journey_to_direct_a_feature_film/) saying I'd share my journey towards making my first feature film. After attending a[ Producer Power-Up](https://ampia.org/producer-power-up/) conference this past weekend, I feel really invigorated, so I wanted to share again. 

I've been spending a lot of my time screenwriting and grant writing, which are pretty solitary effort. So it was quite fulfilling and energizing to be in a room full of other filmmakers and producers doing the same thing that I'm doing. I was like, ""Oh, right! I'm not alone!""

Jumping off the momentum of this event, I want to share a bit about film industry organizations, as they've been an important part of my filmmaking journey. Maybe they'll prove to be important to your artistic journey as well.

Buckle up, I tend to write posts a bit on the longer side. I hope you find something useful in here about networking, connection, film festival rejections, or just being a filmmaker.

[Five panelists at the 2025 Producer Power Up.](https://preview.redd.it/zdb8xu15n3qe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69ae8fa158f9ca3f532f1a9aea57bff01e79e158)

**What are industry organizations and why are they important?**

From what I've gathered, these sorts of organizations can be found in pretty much all major cities, especially those with thriving film industries. Mostly, they're focused on providing resources, training, or opportunities to their members. Here in Calgary (a city which recently [rose to the 5th on the list of the best places to be a filmmaker in North America](https://livewirecalgary.com/2025/01/22/calgary-rises-to-5th-on-list-of-best-places-to-be-a-filmmaker-in-north-america/)), we have two major organizations:

[Calgary Society of Independent Filmmakers](https://csif.org/about/) \- According to their website, CSIF is an artist-run centre for independent filmmakers in Calgary. This society exists to fuel filmmakers, support storytellers, and connect the cinematic community.

https://preview.redd.it/l0k80uxdn3qe1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e88056815609777f487b1b8c99bbf80f901aaf7

I've been a member of CSIF for a couple years now. I'm currently participating in their series of workshops for local filmmakers, and it's been a huge help. Last year, I volunteered with CSIF to direct a short film‚Äîwhich was a great experience and helped me meet some great film crew I've gone on to hire.

[Alberta Media Production Industries Association](https://ampia.org/ampia-about-us/) \- AMPIA's website says they are a professional association with the mandate to support the local independent motion picture industry as a viable economic and cultural force. They also host the Rosie Awards which celebrate media productions in the province. My proof of concept/short film [*Windchasers* was nominated for three Rosie Awards](https://www.andrewgcooper.com/post/windchasers-has-been-nominated-for-three-ampia-rosie-awards) in 2023.

When I first started in filmmaking a few years ago, these organizations helped provide me with resources and connections that have furthered my career. If you live nearby, I highly recommend you check them out. If you live elsewhere, try looking for similar organizations in your area.

[Me with the miniature set featured in Windchasers.](https://preview.redd.it/vtie5s2in3qe1.jpg?width=3216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8542a870bef5f36512bce687d1b40a9fea8143fc)

**Like working with film organizations? The next step**  
**may be to attend film Conferences and Markets.**

The AMPIA event I just attended reminded me of a mini version of the [Banff Media Festival](https://banffmediafestival.playbackonline.ca/), which I attended in 2023 with the intent to pitch [*Windchasers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1wOy_k_m9k&t=8s&ab_channel=SolarisFilmProductions). That was a *blast*, but it was also the first big event I attended after the pandemic. I sort of feel like I...forgot how to interact with humans in person? Like I was desperately out of practise. The first couple days were tough, but by the last day, I'd loosened up and started having a lot more fun.

I made a ton of connections at that conference and ended up booking quite a few pitch meetings. Some of the meeting were with big companies and major broadcasters, which was a first for me. The pitches went well, but even so, *Windchasers*¬†didn't get picked up for a series (obviously).

However, I now have contacts and relationships at some key places, and I think that's a huge win for my career trajectory overall.

**All of this has got me thinking a lot about**  
**the** ***buzzword of all buzzwords*****: ""networking"".**

I used to think networking was something that I needed to master. **Get myself in rooms with the bigwigs**. *Impress the decision-makers*. Cozy up to the gatekeepers.

That's all certainly part of it, but over the years I've found the network I've created has mostly been with my peers. It's been finding people I jive with on a film set. Meeting other filmmakers at industry events. Going for coffee with someone who made a short film like mine. Just being myself and making connections.

**Okay. Time to get personal.**

Something I'm working on right now is finding more connections. [As an introvert](https://bsky.app/profile/andrewgcooper.com/post/3ljgkuokois2o) (and someone quite cerebral) I often stick to myself if left to my own devices. So industry events are a wonderful opportunity to connect with people I'm excited to work with in as well as meet new people in the local industry.

I've also found for me that just focusing on connecting with people (rather than ""networking"") makes these events more enjoyable. It also *greatly* reduces my social anxiety (which I wouldn't necessarily describe as ""crippling"", but can be a major barrier for me at professional events).

So even though it FEELS like I'm often working alone, the truth is you can't make films on your own. (I mean, you *can* if you write, direct, shoot, and act in your own project, but that's a rarity).

One of the things I love the most about the performing arts is how collaborative it is. How much you need other people. As a [published author](https://www.andrewgcooper.com/fiction), I can basically do everything alone. Besides notes from the editor, I create the story from beginning to end. In film and TV (and theatre!), you \*need\* other people. That's why we need connections.

**These art forms are the strongest when**  
**people are collaborating together.**

I'm on a journey to direct a feature film. And that's *definitely* something I don't want to do alone. One of the reasons I've enjoyed Exploring Filmmaking (which now has [its own page on my website](https://www.andrewgcooper.com/exploringfilmmaking)) so much is all the people who've reached out to me about filmmaking! It's helping me reconnect with old collaborators and make new friends online. This is exactly what I want to be doing.

[Attendees at AMPIA's 2025 Producer Power Up.](https://preview.redd.it/bt7js81sn3qe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5dc287d2add8a798bf8cc597828643d5360a7911)

**So I didn‚Äôt get into the first big film festival I wanted.**

It's been a week of ups and downs. On a personal win, [*Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock* won two Children's Emmy Awards](https://www.andrewgcooper.com/post/fraggle-rock-wins-two-emmy-awards-including-outstanding-children-s-series-for-season-2) on the weekend, including Outstanding Children or Family Viewing Series (the big one)! I am so, so proud to be one of the puppeteers for this show and so, so proud of the entire team for this amazing win.

I also heard back from the [Calgary Underground Film Festival](https://www.calgaryundergroundfilm.org/), and my [*Strangers* short film](https://www.andrewgcooper.com/post/strangers-has-wrapped-production) wasn't selected. The programmer was very kind. They told me they really enjoyed the project, but it was hard to program because it's 17-minutes long. (Which is, apparently, very long for a short film.)

Getting into film festivals is part of my big plan as I work towards [writing and directing a feature film](https://www.andrewgcooper.com/post/exploring-filmmaking-my-journey-to-direct-a-feature-film). But sometimes things don't go according to plan.

Sometimes I feel...embarrassed (is that the right word?) when I'm not selected for an opportunity or I don't win an award I'm nominated for. Like, I‚Äôm ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to be better. Like I ""should"" be doing more.

Maybe it‚Äôs because I have really high standards for myself. Maybe my past successes create pressure for me. I realized lately that I've shared lot of successes and exciting news in the past, both here on Reddit and on social media.

**It's fun to share the successes, but a lot of struggle**  
**and work goes into those wins that people often don't see.**

I think it‚Äôs important for people to know that success doesn't come out of nowhere. When I have a hard-won victory, whether it‚Äôs a [theatre show being launched](https://www.andrewgcooper.com/post/starslingers-rehearsals-start-today-with-cirque-nuit-and-jupiter-theatre), [winning an award for a film](https://www.andrewgcooper.com/post/windchasers-won-the-stinger-award-for-best-score), or [helping produce an indie film series](https://www.andrewgcooper.com/post/i-m-producing-a-new-series-with-north-country-cinema), there‚Äôs been a host of failures and rejections along the road to get there.

I mean, at least there always is for me. If you win all of the awards and always get what you apply for PLEASE SHARE YOUR SECRET WITH ME. (Just kidding, I'm striving to focus on the journey rather than the destination.)

Being at the conference this weekend also helped me commiserate with other person. Someone I know told me ""Oh, yeah, I didn't get in either. It's really competitive to get in there with shorts."" And someone I just met said, ""That programmer is a straight shooter. If they told you they liked your film, that means it's good. Even if it didn't get into the festival."" Both of those were really lovely to hear.

So if you're reading this and you didn't get into a film festival you wanted. You're not alone. I'm right there with you.

And I'll still be attending CUFF next month anyway. I love the festival and go every year with my partner. So if you're there too, let me know or come say ""hi"". We can do some of that ""connecting"" I've been talking about.

And speaking of film festivals. I think my next post will be about my film festival strategy for the *Strangers* short film. Which I think is critical since I'm aiming to use this short as a Proof of Concept for [the feature film I'm working towards](https://www.andrewgcooper.com/post/i-m-working-on-a-new-feature-screenplay).

3:00pm - state museum

I‚Äôm new to espresso making but recently purchased a Breville Bambino Plus.    I understand this is not the greatest machine but I know it‚Äôs popular and people have managed to brew decent shots with it.    I‚Äòve played around with it for a few days now and have tried following some YouTube tutorials but haven‚Äôt made anything worth drinking yet.   I‚Äôm not a big fan of straight espresso and intend to use it primarily for lattes and cappuccinos .  I have a cuisart burr mill which is supposed to be trash for espresso grinding.   So for now I stopped at my local coffee shop and had them grind me their medium dark roast with an espresso grinding.  Again, not ideal but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm working with.   Using the stock portafilter and unpressurized cup I‚Äôm using 16.5 grams of espresso for a double shot.   When I start pulling the shot I start getting flow about 9 seconds into the shot and the shot takes about 28-30 seconds which seems reasonable.   But after pulling the shot my scale says 62 grams.   Shouldn‚Äôt it be around 2:1 or maybe 36 ounces or so?    Do I need to be stopping the shot early?    Or is this telling me I either need more ounces of coffee?   I was thinking that because my shot took 28-30 seconds which seems that the grind should be okay.   

Any ideas how to improve?
