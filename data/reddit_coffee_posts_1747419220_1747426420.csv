1koak1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KaylaEatsKids/comments/1koak1e/meeting_madison/,Meeting Madison,"I met my girlfriend Madison at our high school's football game a year ago. Her dad was a friend of my dad's, and she was playing in the band that evening. After the half-time show she came and sat with us in the bleachers, and I couldn't take my eyes off her.

She was about 5 feet 2 inches, long dark hair, freckles, and a perfect bubble butt. I was instantly smitten. She had the cutest accent, sounding like she had just fallen off the hay wagon on the farm.  I decided I needed to get to know her better.

After the game I offered to give her a ride wherever she was going, her mom and step-dad had their two youngest kids with them, and gladly accepted. I told Madison that I would wait for her in the student parking lot. My heart was fluttering with nervousness by this point.

(While waiting for Madison, let me fill you on on myself.  I'm Kayla, a (then 27 year old) mom of a precocious 6 year old little girl, who is my mini-me in every way. I'm bi, and while I still love dick, I'm romantically attracted to women. Especially this 15 year old band geek that I'm about to try to seduce. I'm a LEO, which makes what I'm about to do even riskier than normal, but my pounding heart and aching pussy wasn't hearing any of it.)

I drove to the edge of the parking lot closest to the band room to wait, and saw Madison and two others sitting on the loading dock. They had changed out of their uniforms and were trying to hide the fact that they were smoking. How adorable, as I find young girls smoking to be incredibly sexy. This was definitely a plus, and thought about how to use it to further her seduction.

She waved bye to her friends and climbed in to the Tahoe. Her short stature proved a challenge but she eventually made it in the passengers seat. As we pulled out of the parking lot, she turned to me and asked ""You didn't see any of that, right?"" I glanced over at the cautious expression on her face and said, ""Didn't see what?"", then lit a cigarette, and handed her my pack.  She face split into a grin, as she lit one of her own, letting the smoke waft from her lips and out the window into the chilly October night.

We drove into town, stopping at the Starbucks for coffee. Getting back into the truck, I turned on In This Moment's ""Sex Metal Barbie"" on low, and sipped my coffee while looking at her from the corner of my eye, only to see her doing the same. I broke out into giggles, and asked what she had planned for the rest of the night.

Madison mentioned her friends were going across town to hang out (which I knew to mean celebrate the teams' win like hooligans in the WalMart parking lot) but she wasn't feeling that tonight. I appeared to think about it for about it for a second, then asked if she wanted to go to the Swinging Bridge and hang out. I knew there would be some others there, but no one would bother any of us, as the Bridge is on private property at each end, and given over to recreational fishing and kayaking. If some underage drinking and other foolishness happens, so be it. No one lives close enough to hear music or other noise, so the town cops wouldn't show up unless someone there called them.

Madison was down for this, so we went to Sheetz, and I went inside to get a few packs of wine coolers. I also grabbed a pack of smokes for her, and we took of towards the river.

When we arrived, only two other cars where there, so we parked at the edge of the dead end turn-around, got out and walked across to the middle the bridge. It was 11pm by then, with a sliver of a moon to see by. We hung on to the cable hand rail tightly, as a cold breeze was blowing down the river. I shivered involuntarily, and Madison (call me Madi) put her arm around me and hugged me, to which I responded with my arm around her. We stood there shivering occasionally for a few minutes with the foot-bridge swaying in the wind, then decided to get back to the warmth of the Tahoe.

Back in the truck we grabbed some wine coolers and cracked the windows, with the heat turned up. We quickly shed our coats, which allowed me a very nice view of this little girls cleavage, barely covered by her tank top that she had worn beneath her band uniform. My own tits were nearly on full display, and I was feeling very dangerous tonight.

As she lit a cigarette, I was drawn to her full lips and new I desperately wanted to feel them against my own.  I reached over, tucking a strand of her hair behind her ear, as she turned to me and offered her cigarette to me. I took it and took a deep drag, allowing the smoke to slowly waft from my lips. I smiled at Madi as I handed it back, then took a pull from my bottle.  I wanted to make a move but wasn't sure how receptive she would be. I was encouraged when she put her arm around me earlier, but I didn't want to blow it by moving too fast.

Madi then sighed deeply, like she had the world on her shoulders. I asked what was wrong, genuinely concerned for this sweet girl. She replied that she wished she could stay here forever and not go home. I asked why, and was rewarded with a nightmare of verbal and psychological abuse from her stepfather, with no intervention from her timid mother.

After she was finished, I wasn't sure exactly how to respond. I leaned across the console and hugged her tightly, feeling her heart thumping within her chest.

I had her call her mom, then took her phone when she answered. I asked if Madison could babysit for me tonight, and that I was called into work because someone called in sick. Her mom agreed easily, and I promised I would drive her home after 8am.

Madi looked at me with surprise on her face. I just smiled and said tonight was about her and she wasn't going to worry about anything else.  I hugged her again, then kissed her quickly on the lips, pulling away before she could react.

As it was 1130pm, there wasn't a lot to do (besides the depraved shit I sometimes got in to, and she wasn't ready for that yet), so we drove to my house. Going inside, we but the alcohol in the fridge, and I grabbed the bottle of margaritas and 2 glasses, and we sat on the sectional. My daughter was at my parents for the weekend, so we were alone and could be as obnoxious as we wanted.  I took off my shorts and tshirt, and invited her to do the same. Soon we were in nothing but sports bras and underwear, and we set out to kill the bottle while sharing a few secrets.

Madison was surprisingly comfortable around me, which was a very pleasant development. As it turns out, the reason her stepfather was being an asshole was because she came out to her mother as bisexual. Being super-annoyingly religious, her mom and stepdad were basically shunning her when she was home, with the exception of public appearances, like the football game.  Luckily my own father was very understanding of my sexual preferences, so I never had to go through what she was enduring.

We drank some more while listening to my girl band Playlist, and I leaned over to her and quickly kissed her again on her lips. We kissed...tenderly at first, then with mounting passion as our tongues found their eachother, our moans of desire going unheard by anyone else, our need desperate as she pushed me back on the sectional, straddling my lap as I unclasped her bra, allowing her young breasts to spill out, her perfect nipples proudly displayed, begging to be devoured.

My lips moved to her nipples, resulting in a strangled moan from my young lover, my tongue swirling around her nipple, gently sucking at first, then with abandon as my other hand found her swollen mound, my fingertips quickly locating her secret spot as my lips found her other nipple, devouring this child who so desperately needed the release from a religiously oppressed bullshit home environment.

As we kissed some more, my fingers pressing into her swollen mound, I was overcome by the intense desire to induct this little girl into my world of evil acts and depravity now instead of later. No doubt she would enjoy the benefits, but could her mind survive without breaking? Only time would tell.  I decided to revisit this at a later date.

Slipping two fingers inside her fiery pussy, I began fucking her tight hole slowly, enjoying her moans of surrender and she pushed her hips back against me, her kisses now more intense against my mouth, her hair falling around our eyes as I stole away any innocence my young lover may have had left within.

We broke our embrace briefly, as I got two bottles of water for us, then led her to my bedroom. Lying on the bed, I invited her next to me, and retrieved some items from the nightstand drawer. With her lying next to me, I leaned in and kissed her lips, tasting her delicious mouth upon mine, as I placed one end of my doubleheaded dildo against her hungry pussy, rubbing it against her lips as her juices coated the head. Kissing her harder, I slowly pushed the head of my latex cock into her young cunt, letting her get accustomed to the feeling of being stretched open before advancing further into my lovers immature fuckhole.

Her sudden scream in my ear telling me I took her cherry, I hugged her closely, kissing her neck as her little girl pussy became a womans' gaping cunt. Her continued moans told me she was receptive to my attentions, so I placed the other end against my evil orifice, and plunged our substitute boy toy deep inside me. Once our pussies were nestled against eachother, I began grinding against my young lover, her moans growing in intensity as we made love, her hips thrusting against mine, my hands cupping her pale asscheeks, spreading them apart obscenely as we fucked, my fingers finding her puckered shithole.

I sucked on two fingers, then returned them to her shapely ass, massaging her brown hole as we jumped eachother desperately. I could feel an intense orgasm building, so I slowly pushed my two fingers into her tight shithole to my second knuckle, and heard her gasp then moan loudly. Our rhythm increased then, thrusting and grinding in desperation and lust...or what it something else?

I felt Madi tense up suddenly, I kissed her ear and neck lightly while grinding hard into her cunt, as her arms tightened around me. I whispered ""I love you"" in her ear as my own orgasm overtook me, and I kissed her deeply as our pussies spasmed around our latex lover, with my fingers buried inside her clenching butthole.

As we came down from the dopamine rush, Madi looked into my eyes and said ""I love you Kayla. Did you mean what you said?""  Continuing to grind my pussy into hers, I told her I meant it ""with all my heart and soul"", and I realized I did. I loved this girl incredibly.

As we broke our sticky embrace, I lit a cigarette and handed it to her, then moved lower in the bed. As my young lover inhaled, I plunged my tongue inside her still gaping pussy, tasting our combined juices as I watched her smoke for me, my eyes locked on hers as I devoured her swollen cunt, then abused her clit with my tongue, bring her to another beautiful orgasm.

Later I would teach her to return the favor, but for now I savored her innocence lost to me on this cold night in late October.

1koaho8,https://www.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1koaho8/just_read_a_world_is_not_ending_dont_worry_thread/,"Just read a ""world is not ending, don't worry"" thread","I want to chime in with all of the deep internet diving and just things in general not only myself but a ton of people around the world have felt and experienced. My family, in particular a few of us, aren't psychics per se, but do feel things and see things, among other things, talk to spirits and other experiences. Belief is a huge part of it, because once you truly believe, the universe will notice this and start showing you things not otherwise perceived. On to the meat.

The perceived ""evil miasma"" that you speak of is no joke. I'm not going to refer to ""the good ol days"" only because mainly the cause of these things are beliefs and perceptions of different times. We all experience it differently. Now, if we can agree on one thing, is that SOMETHING IS WRONG. We all feel it, something is coming, something is not right, something is in the back of our minds and along with it rampant anxiety, depression, fear, etc. 

This feeling isn't something to be ignored, and whether you like it or not, call it what you will, but you are about to be judged on every single thought, look, and thing you've done to yourself and other people and/or animals good and bad (yes the internet hassattery counts).

You should NOT relax, but realize and comprehend this notion. You should not gather anxiety and fear because it helps no one. You should also not really deep dive and ""think"" you are preparing but only making it worse. I did this and came across a video of a priest explaining the bibles end of the world where giant lion body tiger head horned demons with razor sharp claws by the millions will decimate 80% of the worlds population. HOW it happens is really irrelevant. Highly suggest focusing on yourself and others instead (yes you can change lives!).

I personally would rather think about the bad things I've done, and ask for forgiveness. Then I would take steps to change (if you need change) for the better. I suppose we all can change or do more in someway no matter how good you are. Now, before I give tips on what to change and how to ""make it into heaven"" or the 5th dimension or the spirit world etc. I want to say to the people that don't believe in God or sins etc. that what you have done in this lifetime matters just as much as belief, if not more. You are going to go somewhere no matter what, but the good (God) you brought in to the world is key. For example, if you look at someone high up, has an amazing positive funny humor personality, has a lot of friends, success, family etc, and then look at someone who maybe was just like you in younger days, but is now living on the streets, stuck in the same viscous cycle rhythm, shooting up, getting drunk and high, filthy dirty, and attracting the same filthy lost people around. Ask yourself, who is more likely to move on to a good place in the universe, and who is likely to be tortured again, just like in life itself.

I will without a doubt choose the Good side, the Good guys, Team Good, the Winning Team. I will choose Love, and laughter, compassion and just a chill vibe. I KNOW I am a good person just by where I am, and the things that happen to me. A random kid at work came up and hugged me the other day. Baby's and animals love me just as much as I love them. People I interact with are absolutely amazing. Doesn't everyone want that in their lives? If you are a person that chooses death and destruction, is that really you choosing that or something negging you, pushing you to do it?

I don't know how many threads I've read of someone either wanting to quit weed, drugs or booze or someone who is sober for X amt of days. People DO want to be good, it's just this world and the society man has built that is the TRAP. We need to teach our kids growing up to avoid these gov soc traps and things that are allowed into the world. 

Ok, so you read that, I thank you. Now here's in return, a few things you can do to make it through into a good place. Wait for it...it's not that hard! Such secret, what could it ever be? Well, it's BE GOOD MUTHAFUKKA! Just be good. You've seen earlier that the word ""good"" basically came from God right? Not hard to just not backstab your fellow man. No gaslighting (I hate that phrase), no hitting, no cheating, no gains off other peoples backs (looking at you bad business owners), no partying out of control, no fake ass mean comments, no drugs/alcohol and anything that alters your mind/body IS a drug including coffee. I'm sure you get the point. We all have a compass but many MANY choose to not follow guidance. 

Lastly, a big big portion of it is energy. Your energy frequency will dictate where you will go in the end. This is where I'm not proficient in and if you want more, head to the energy thread for a deep dive. This deep dive I DO recommend. Things I've done, waking up earlier with my natural circ rhythm, grabbed a grounding mat/blanket, get out in the morning and get some sun, eat raw veg and cut fried greasy starchy gluteny foods (fries make you depresso!), smile and laugh in the mirror first thing, be more polite, joke around and in a better mood (will come with better food and sleep), and don't forget good ol exercise (just do it!). Now 2 things I'd highly recommend, a bit unortho but think of the sun, and what it does to dandelions and sunflowers. Before and after bed eat some dandelion (5 or so) and sunflower seeds (no oil). Before bed so the doctor doesn't make his bread, eat a quality apple. I can definitely tell I feel better eating these things and it's good for heart body and brain. 

That's it for now, feel free to hit me up to just talk. Bless you my people and lets work together to be happy because that's all we really want eh? So hard these days I know but it's all a big puzzle we need to figure out, sometimes a few pieces are missing. Take care brothers and sisters, much love from the heart.

Peace

1koahfg,https://i.redd.it/iyr1jyjsa71f1.jpeg,Keto pizza recipe (Original!),"Note: this has been rewritten with chatGPT but the recipe still an original.

This is my own upgraded version of the classic chicken crust recipe — made to be firm, crispy on the bottom, and foldable like real pizza. Most chicken crusts fall apart or feel eggy. This one holds up.

⸻

🧾 Ingredients (for a full pizza 11”)

	•	3 cans (1 pound total) of canned chicken, well-drained.
	•	3/4 cup almond flour
	•	6 tbsp cottage cheese (drained)
	•	6 tbsp grated parmesan
	•	3 tbsp nutritional yeast
	•	1.5 tsp psyllium husk (I used veggie pill capsules)
	•	3 large eggs
	•	3/4 tsp garlic powder
	•	3/4 tsp onion powder
	•	3/4 tsp salt

⸻

🧼 Drain tips
	•	Chicken: Press through a mesh strainer or squeeze with paper towels until dry
	•	Cottage cheese: Use a mesh strainer, coffee filter, or cheesecloth and let it sit to reduce moisture

⸻

🔄 Instructions
	1.	Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C)
	2.	Blend all crust ingredients in a food processor or blender until smooth
	3.	Spread mixture onto a parchment-lined pizza pan (aim for a 12–14 inch crust)
	4.	Bake 20–25 minutes, until top is set and golden
	5.	Let cool 2–3 mins, then carefully flip (use a second tray + parchment trick)
	6.	Bake another 5–8 mins on the other side until golden brown and firm
	7.	Top with:
	•	Hunt’s No Sugar Added tomato sauce
	•	Trio of meats (ham, pepperoni, smoked ham)
	•	Gouda cheese
	8.	Return to oven 7–10 mins to melt toppings, then broil 2–3 mins until bubbly and browned
	9.	Let it rest 5–10 minutes before slicing — this is key to final structure 

📊 Macros (Whole Pizza w/ Toppings – Approximate)

Based on all ingredients + a modest layer of sauce, cheese, and meat

	•	Calories: ~1,850 kcal
	•	Protein: ~160g
	•	Fat: ~115g
	•	Net Carbs: ~8–10g



——

Personal notes:
- careful flipping the dough, i broke mine a little bit while doing so.
- draining and removing moisture is very important, dont skip it.
- i used a hand blender to mix everything.
- i could only have two slices, this is so filling.
- added oregano before broiling and a little more parmesan.

1koahbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1koahbx/got_337_v_167_q_170_awa_45_down_from_55_at_first/,"Got 337: V - 167, Q - 170, AWA - 4.5 (down from 5.5 at first attempt)","The GRE general test was taken by me on May 8, in a test center. I prepared starting January 25, paid for 3 months of gregmat subscription and ETS' PowerPrep+ 3 and 1 tests that I took 15 and 7 days before the test day. Also used TTP's 5-day trial for the days right before the test day, minimizing test prep on the last day.

This is my 2nd attempt, and in the first attempt in December 2023 (at home testing) I got: V -157, Q - 161, AWA - 5.5. I used only free gre materials online and gregmat videos. In that prep, some parts of GRE quant foundations and a lot of vocab were not covered for sure. The high AWA score is probably because the topic was favorable for me (I do not remember it now) and let me fully demonstrate my essay-writing capacities that likely were stronger back then as I wrote my bachelor's thesis that year.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PART 1  suggestions that might help.  
  
I strongly recommend:

1. Buying PP+ 3, PP+ 2 and 1, in that order, and taking the last of them a week or so before the test day
2. Subscribing on [gregmat.com](http://gregmat.com) if you are not well-versed in GRE test concepts and know where to find good free test preparation otherwise
3. Use not only gregmat's vocab list, but also Vince's, Barron's GRE vocab decks available on Anki (found this [one](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111722370) for Barron's and also used [this ](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/298946902)combined one)
4. Trying to give more attention to grammar when you are able to consistently bring up tenable lines of reasoning for AWA topics. There is an available pool of AWA prompts by ETS for that
5. Making error logs on notion (like [mine](https://www.notion.so/GRE-Quant-Error-Log-1e058e3c7d3a80f5bacbc6c6f63b9865?pvs=4)), I personally did this for quant only
6. Skip questions leaving QCs for later (as gregmat recommends) in quant, and doing SEs -> 1-blanker TC -> 2-blanker TC -> 3-blanker TC -> the CR question -> shorter reading passage -> longer reading passage questions in Verbal, as TTP suggests, IIRC. Time spent for skipping won't be counted by the system, but you must be able to comfortably keep in your mind how many questions you have skipped.
7. Train yourself to be fully engaged during practice tests if you struggle with distractions and attention blinks as I do. Things I did are (from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH7N9YRxMYc)) meditation-like sitting with closed eyes and thinking only about how you breathe and emptying your mind and diffused vision when you deliberately do not focus your eyes and just let them look at a whole visual range, kind of
8. Consider increasing intake of food that helps with focus and attention like salmon, walnuts, blueberries, bananas, eggs. See this [list](https://scientificorigin.com/25-foods-that-can-improve-your-concentration-and-focus). I think this helped me a bit

Quant is now heavily favoring accuracy once you are proficient in foundations, I believe. Quite likely my perception is skewed because I did a lot of gregmat and TTP hardest quant questions and they were way more difficult than the hardest quant questions on my test day. For this purpose, I advise splitting your quant error logs or having 2 separate for the time before you mastered the quant foundations and after: when you are nearing your test day, you better go through error logs that remind you of your careless mistakes rather than smth. like ""I forgot that xyz formula"". Remember to make a habit of checking for these careless mistake situations as you do more quant practice set prep.

Verbal is filled with specialized and rarely used vocab. All I can give are standard and helpful tips: do train your vocab a lot, look for question answers around words mentioned in the question, find the portions most strongly asserted (they are often the main points of passages), remember about pairs in SE (rarely this does not apply and 2 words with unrelated meanings fit the blank) and math (or other) strategy for TC.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PART 2 - reflections on test prep and results.

PP+ 1 scores: V - 166, Q - 167, AWA - 5.0  
Verbal:1 SE answer in section 1 and 3 (a 2-blanker TC, 1 reading, and 1 SE) in section 2 were incorrect  
Quant: in section 2, 2 MC answers were incorrect: 1 for failing to account for all possibilities and another because of carelessly forgetting that whatever the number is of possible, mutually exclusive outcomes, their probabilities add up to 1.  
During PP+ 1 I tried to write down too much of everything and left little time to deal with tricky quant questions.

PP+ 3 results: V - 168, Q - 170, AWA - 5.0  
Verbal: could not get 1 SE for lack of vocab, and a 3-blanker for thinking of words' meanings too narrowly, thus not getting the word in the 3 blank that had a clue for it.  
Quant: caught 4 (!) careless mistakes, 2 in the 1 section, and 2 in the 2 section. This was a sign that I am finally getting able to fight with attention blink mishaps. 

I actually felt like my 2 section of quant is medium, because the questions seemed so easy after doing many harder questions on TTP and gregmat, including all the very/extremely hard questions on gregmat. But I did not let this worsen my mood as I thought ""I am going to get a decent score anyways"". Found 1 careless mistake during the review - sizeable improvement in first-attempt accuracy over PP+ 3 results. Happy and relieved with 170 here.

Honestly, I did not spend that much time on verbal prep and aimed to just get 160+, and ideally have 165. Verbal was always tricky for me as for a native speaker, but I am certainly stronger in reading than in speaking or reading. For instance, I got 8.5 on IELTS reading on the first (with no knowledge of the format) mock test when my overall score was 5.5. But GRE's reading is more difficult than IELTS'. Anyways, during my prep, I would come back to incorrectly answered reading questions and most often find the right answer after re-doing those questions. Any passages related to arts where the hardest for me to grasp. In the 2 section, I stayed on the first of the 3 skipped reading passages for too long (hurrying with the other passages and leaving no time to review all answers) and did not know a couple of words, but I eventually did manage to get 167 and am surprised that I got into the 97th percentile!

For AWA, I am more than happy for the score of 4.5, although I did get 5.5 on my first attempt at GRE. I admit that I have some grammar issues and vocab narrowness that make my writing short of the highest caliber, but I also do think that the prompt ""It is no longer possible for a society to regard any man or woman as a hero"" was challenging for me as I actually had no idea of why would anyone claim this and sadly I did not remember any content from gregmat's video covering this topic (besides the essay format). I feel like each of my reason paragraphs was a bit fluid and digressing away from the reasons stated in their 1st sentences, which made my essay short of excellent.

  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Test-taking experiences:  
Before the test day, I drunk some kefir the night before for good digestion, ate oatmeal before the test, and consumed regular amount of coffee in a recommended window ([link](https://www.betterup.com/blog/best-time-to-drink-coffee)). Twice my rented Veturilo bikes were broken (I wanted to get faster blood circulation before the test), but I did it in time. I woke up a few times during the night before the test as I usually do before some important events, but this was not that much of a problem.

To sum up, I am glad that this is over and that I managed to improve on my deficiencies of attention in test-taking. I hope you all will also get your desired scores.



TL;DR 

* Hardest gregmat and TTP quant questions are way harder than actual GRE quant questions

There’s a quiet war happening on countertops, at checkout stands, and beside coffee shop tip jars:  
A war for **stars**—Google stars. ✨

In the battlefield of local business, the most elite weapon isn't a billboard or a flashy ad—it’s a **Google Review NFC card**.

But wait... before you grab the first one off Etsy or try slapping your URL onto a coaster, let's take a deeper look at what Redditors, real business owners, and savvy marketers are whispering about in the digital alleyways of the internet—and what they *aren’t* telling you.

# 1. Are all Google Review cards created equal?

Short answer? **Nope. Not even close.**

Some are as generic as a toaster manual, others shine like a diamond in a sea of cubic zirconia. What sets them apart?

* **Chip reliability** – Not all NFC tags are programmed equally. Some lose signal faster than a Bluetooth speaker on 1%.
* **Design psychology** – People don’t scan ugly. It’s a fact.
* **Redirect experience** – The faster and cleaner the user flow, the more likely you get that sweet 5-star review.

At [TAProCard.com](https://www.taprocard.com), we’ve spent months perfecting a tap experience that feels like magic. But hey, don’t take our word for it—there’s an entire [blog full of tips]() we quietly update for the nerds who like to win.

# 2. Can I make my own review card with a QR code or NFC?

Sure you can! And you can technically make sushi in your garage, too.

DIY works… until:

* The sticker peels,
* The NFC link expires,
* Or someone scans it and ends up on your homepage instead of your review link.

Reddit’s full of these heroic tales gone wrong. For something as important as **your business reputation**, a little polish goes a long way. We recommend at least skimming a few pro tips—our blog has a killer post about **DIY NFC traps to avoid**.

# 3. Can I track how often my cards are being tapped?

Yes—but only if you're clever about how you set them up.

Many business owners get excited about their new cards, hand them out like candy, and then wonder... *""Did anyone even scan this thing?""*

The trick? Use **custom redirect links** or services with built-in tracking. Some smart solutions even tell you *where* it was tapped. Spoiler alert: We’re rolling out tracking features at [TAProCard](https://www.taprocard.com) soon. (Yep, that’s your cue to get in early.)

# 4. Why aren’t my Google reviews showing up after customers tap the card?

Ah yes, the ghost review dilemma. 👻

You followed all the rules, and *poof*—nothing. Not even a “Thanks for your review” email.

**Here’s the tea:**

* Google’s algorithm filters out reviews from accounts that look suspicious or inactive.
* If a customer is connected to your Wi-Fi or using the same device as another reviewer, Google might flag it.
* Also… never *ask* for a “5-star review.” Just ask for *honest feedback*. Google sees everything.

Our blog gets into this in detail, but the short version: **Don’t game the system—just guide your customers through it.**

# 5. Where can I get a professional QR code stand or card?

Laminated printer paper taped to a mason jar? Cute, but not conversion-worthy.

The trend now is **sleek, durable, customizable**, and eye-catching. Think **acrylic stands, metal NFC plates, wooden blocks with engraved QR codes**—the kind of thing that feels like part of your brand.

Curated vendors like **TAPro** offer both modern design and functionality, and even let you match it with your logo or theme. And yes—we do keychains, stickers, menus, and even coasters that work double-time.

# 6. Can I track how many times my NFC card is accessed?

Double-tapping this one because it’s *that* important.

Many users don’t realize that the link they embed in the NFC chip **can** be monitored—*if* you use the right type of URL. Dynamic redirect links with UTM codes or services like [Bit.ly](http://Bit.ly) can give you intel without invading privacy.

Smart sellers already embed this into their products. If you're thinking long-term, don't settle for ""just a card""—think of it like a **data-gathering field agent in your marketing army**.

# 7. What makes a truly effective review card?

Design matters. Psychology matters more.

Here’s what works:

* **Eye contact** → Use photos of real people or trusted faces.
* **Urgency** → A little “Help us grow!” or “Scan now, it only takes 5 seconds” does wonders.
* **Rewarding language** → Not bribery—but appreciation. Think: *“Your feedback is gold.”*

Our guide on [designing high-converting review cards]() is a must-read if you want to outsmart the competition without outspending them.

# 8. Is this even legal? Will Google slap me for this?

Yes, it’s legal—**as long as you play by the rules.**

Google hates:

* Buying reviews.
* Offering discounts in exchange for reviews.
* Faking reviews from burner accounts.

But if you’re simply **making it easier for happy customers to leave honest feedback**, you’re not just in the clear—you’re doing exactly what Google wants: **More transparency. More trust. More truth.**

# 9. Where do I buy NFC review products that fit my branding?

Customization is king. People want their brand on **everything**—from the napkin to the tap card.

Vendors that just sell cookie-cutter plastic cards? Outdated.

Sites like [TAProCard.com](https://www.taprocard.com) let you personalize stands, stickers, cards, and more, giving your brand a consistent, elevated look from the door to the digital space.

# 10. NFC vs SMS – which works better for getting reviews?

SMS is great—until:

* It gets marked as spam.
* Customers ignore it.
* Or your CRM sends it 3 hours late.

NFC? It’s instant. No delay, no typing, no “I’ll do it later.” Just a tap, a click, and a review.

💡Pro tip: The best approach? Use **both**—and test which gets better results for your audience.

# Final Thoughts (and Secret Sauce)

If you’re still unsure which review strategy fits your business, here’s our advice:

**Stop guessing. Start testing.**  
The businesses winning in 2025 aren’t the ones who hustle the hardest—they’re the ones who *optimize smarter*.

1koafmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1koafmp/update_we_talked_it_out/,UPDATE: We talked it out,"OG post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/dGJa8vhpN9 

So we finally met together and talked. I had tried to keep things light in my texting, and took some of your guy’s advice and just let her know that I was here for her and moved on. The tension was killing me, though. Thankfully she decided she wanted to talk this morning. 

We met up off campus at a coffee shop we both like. I was so anxious that I arrived like 20min early. To my surprise, she was already there. Apparently we’ve both been panicking. I’ve been panicking that she’s going to want to distance herself from me after what happened, and she has been panicking that I’d be pissed at her for “kicking me out” after we had sex. We ended up laughing about it, since it turns out, neither one of us wants to stop being friends.

She did tell me she does have something she wants to talk about though, and that we definitely need to address the idea of sex going forward. 

She then told me why she cried after the sex. Apparently, she had been SAed by an adult male family friend when we were still just kids on the bus. She never told me, but the situation was messy. The fucker did end up in jail, and my friend ended up in therapy for a while. I had known she was in therapy, but just figured it was for anxiety or something. The one time I had brought it up, she was super defensive about it, so I never pried. Now so much about that makes a lot of sense. This whole situation would make her very fearful of men, and would be part of the reason she later came out as a lesbian. 

She never told me at the time because we were just kids and she felt a lot of shame about the situation. Even after working a lot of things out in therapy she still never told me because she was scared I’d see her differently. I was the only guy she actually felt comfortable to be around, and her best friend, so she didn’t want to do anything to ruin that. 

She tried to apologize for never telling me and for crying all over me, but I shut that shit down. She owes me no apology. If anyone should be sorry, it’s the fuck face that hurt her, and I told her as much. She hugged me and thanked me for being understanding and said that she really appreciated me. 

She also said, just to clear up a few things, that she did really enjoy the sex, and her reaction had very little to do with me. The sex just dug up some deeply repressed memories and she got very emotional very quickly. She again tried to apologize for being a “mood killer”. I again tried to tell her stop apologizing, but she cut me off and said that she was the one who initiated everything without telling me the whole story or that she had been falling for me recently. 

She admitted that she does have feelings for me, and even believes she probably loves me. Obviously we’ve loved each other as friends, but she’s been having a hard time seeing me as just a friend for several months. She said it’s been really confusing though, since she’s lived as a lesbian for so long. She definitely still is attracted to women, but so far I’m the only guy she has ever had feelings for. She doesn’t know whether or not that makes her bi, but after thinking about it, she’s decided what’s important isn’t her orientation, but that she has feelings for me and wants to go out with me if I’m willing. 

I said yes, and that I’d always found her attractive, but figured this would never happen after she came out. She laughed and said I should feel honored, since I technically get to claim I turned a lesbian. I told her getting out of the friend zone is technically more legendary. She punched my arm and called me an idiot. 

That’s pretty much the end of the story. We kept hanging out after that, but yeah. 

I do want to thank the kind people of Reddit, though. You really kept me from spiraling when I was panicking and your comments on sexuality being a spectrum really opened my eyes. Thank you! ",5,1747425920.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I'm beginning to wonder if there is a ""one bag"" for me, or if I need to invest in two (laptop bag and all-in-one travel bag) to meet my needs. Every time I think I have something picked out, I begin to question it.

Here is what I think I'm looking for:

* Stylish/sleek design - nothing that looks like I'm rocking a JanSport by another name
* Feels solid/luxurious(?) - good zipper feel, for example
* Comfortable
* Ability to hold 16"" laptop, mouse, Kindle, headphones, water bottle, charging cables, small charging bank
   * Bonus if it can hold an additional 13"" laptop, though this is a rare need
* Ability to hold 1-2 outfits and a pair of flip flops
* Bonus if it has organizational pockets for phone, passport, pens, notebook, etc.,
* Fits under an airplane seat
* Has a luggage pass-through
* Doesn't look too bulky/goofy when I just throw in a laptop and mouse and go to a coffee shop
   * I'm getting hung up on this; so many bags that meet the other criteria feel like they'd be a bit much to roll into a coffee shop with
* Nice to have (not required): Ability to carry as a backpack, satchel, etc.

  
So far, I've been looking primarily at Timbuk2, Tom Bihn, GoRuck (though I don't think that's for me). I'm willing to spend a bit if it's worth it.

  
Any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

I have mental and physical health issues, and lately it's been really hard as I've finally exposed my father for sexually abusing me as a child.

Last night I was at my boyfriend's place, couldn't sleep at all because I was having flashbacks and some psychotic symptoms. I let him sleep but this morning I asked him to drive me home so I could get my meds. He said ok, hugged me a couple times and asked a few questions, but he also kept sighing that he was going to be late for work. He asked for coffee at my place and then left. He texted me around 4PM saying he hoped I had been able to get some sleep. Now it's 10PM here and he hasn't even read my answer.

It's always like this when I'm going through a rough patch. He's not mean or anything, but I feel like not only does he not care how I feel, he's actually annoyed whenever I'm not being the Perfect Perky Girl. It feels like he just does the bare minimum to not look like an AH.

I'm not asking for some grand gesture or anything. I just wish he'd show he cared, give me a back rub or offer to bring me some soup or *something*.

“I’m suing you for defamation.” He replied. He gave my big red nut one last squeeze with the tongs before jumping out the window.

1koa825,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1koa825/last_vlog_screenplay_idea/,Last Vlog (screenplay idea),"The image is slightly grainy, framed by the edges of a laptop screen. We are looking through a WEBCAM. The perspective is fixed, pointing towards a desk in a cluttered, lived-in room. Bookshelves, papers, coffee mugs are scattered around.  
  
DOUG WEST (40s), wearing a comfortable, slightly worn t-shirt, sits at the desk, looking directly into the webcam lens. He has a friendly, if a little tired, face. Behind him, a TELEVISION is on, the volume low, displaying a news channel. He gestures vaguely around the room.  
  
Doug speaks directly to the camera: ""Hey, folks. Not much to report today. Standard routine, you know? Woke up, had my daily wrestling match with the coffee maker – spoiler alert, it won, left me with lukewarm disappointment again."" He sighs dramatically, then grins. ""Did some puttering in the garden, though. You would not believe the zucchini this year. Seriously, they're like sentient green blimps. I'm gonna have to start giving them away at the side of the road, maybe set up a little 'Free Zucchini' stand before they take over the house.""  
  
He gestures vaguely around the room. ""Read a bit. Tried to focus, anyway. And, well..."" His eyes drift towards the low hum coming from the corner. ""Watched... you know... watched the news."" The TV is on, muted mostly, just the endless scroll of the news chyron providing a quiet backdrop.  
  
Suddenly, a sound cuts through the room – a loud, electronic TONE blares from the TV SPEAKERS. The image on the screen changes to a stark graphic: a red triangle, text overlaid. Doug's head snaps towards it. His smile vanishes, replaced by a frown of confusion.  
  
Doug says to the camera: ""Huh? What's that?""  
  
The alert graphic disappears as quickly as it came, replaced by a NEWSCASTER with a face etched with seriousness. Doug leans forward, listening intently, trying to catch the low volume.  
  
The newscaster's voice is clearer now, though still muffled. ""...We are interrupting this broadcast for an urgent emergency alert. Reports are coming in of a major train derailment approximately fifty miles west of the city. Preliminary information indicates a significant chemical spill from several ruptured tanker cars. Authorities are reporting extremely unusual and aggressive behavior from local insect populations in the affected area, believed to be a direct result of exposure to the spilled chemicals. Residents within a seventy-five mile radius are strongly advised to shelter in place immediately and seal all entry points to their homes...""  
  
Slowly, Doug pushes his chair back, the legs scraping on the wooden floor. He stands and moves out of the webcam's view, presumably heading towards a window behind his desk. The camera remains fixed on the empty chair and the now-ominous TV screen.  
  
The newscaster's voice continues, the image on the TV now showing a distant, shaky shot of a dark plume of smoke on the horizon.  
  
Off-screen, Doug's VOICE is heard, sharp with surprise, followed by a choked GASP.  
  
Doug reappears in the frame, but only to grab the laptop. He lifts it, turning the webcam's view. The image swivels wildly for a moment before settling on the view through a window behind where his desk was.  
  
Rising above the distant treeline is a colossal, inky BLACK PLUME of smoke. It's vast and seems to pulse slightly against the sky. Doug's hand, gripping the laptop, is visible at the edge of the frame, trembling.  
  
Doug quickly moves back to the desk, placing the laptop down. The webcam view is back on him. He sinks into his chair, his face pale, eyes wide with shock as he stares at the camera. The newscaster's voice from the TV is louder now, more urgent. ""...advising residents to stay indoors...""  
  
The TV screen cuts to a REPORTER, ANNA, standing near bright YELLOW POLICE TAPE. Figures in bulky WHITE HAZMAT SUITS are visible in the background.  
  
Doug says to the camera: ""They're saying what?""  
  
Anna's voice comes through the TV, strained. ""Anna, reporting live from the perimeter established near the derailment site. As you can see behind me, hazmat teams are on the ground, assessing the situation. The air here is thick with a strange odor, and we're seeing unprecedented insect activity. Swarms, unlike anything I've ever witnessed, are behaving erratically. Scientists believe the spilled chemical is acting as a powerful, unpredictable stimulant on local insect life. Authorities are struggling to contain the affected zone as the swarms appear to be expanding rapidly...""  
  
Behind Anna, the HAZMAT SUIT figures suddenly stop and point towards something off-screen. Shouts are heard. Anna's eyes widen in sudden TERROR. She gasps, turning her head.  
  
People in HAZMAT SUITS begin SCREAMING, a high-pitched, panicked sound, and start running frantically past Anna, away from something unseen. Anna herself freezes for a second, her mouth agape, before she, too, turns to run.  
  
For a split second, a large, indistinct DARK MASS seems to boil and surge behind the fleeing figures before the TV FEED CUTS OUT.  
  
The screen goes black for a moment, then the EMERGENCY ALERT graphic returns, the electronic TONE blaring again.  
  
Doug is still staring at the webcam, his face slack with shock. He slowly shakes his head, muttering to the camera: ""What was that? What was happening? ""  
  
He listens. The BLARING TONE from the TV is loud, but underneath it, a new sound begins to emerge from outside – a low, growing ROAR, like distant thunder, but constant.  
  
He reaches out, grabs the laptop again. The webcam swivels, pointing back towards the window behind the desk.  
  
The view is the window pane. Outside is dark, indistinct. The sun must have been blocked out by that... plume.  
  
Doug says to the camera, his voice suddenly sharp, laced with alarm: ""It's getting louder. What is that sound? It's not thunder..."" His hand holding the laptop shakes violently.  
  
Suddenly, loud, wet SPLAT sounds begin hitting the glass. Dark shapes SLAM into the window pane. SPLAT! SPLAT! SPLAT! Rapid-fire impacts.  
  
Doug exclaims to the camera: ""What the hell?!"" Dark, viscous liquid and indistinct organic matter smears across the glass with each impact. More SPLATs follow, faster and faster.  
  
The webcam view shifts slightly upwards, showing the sky outside the window. It is no longer visible. The entire view is filled with a churning, SOLID BLACK MASS. Insects, millions upon millions, a thick, moving cloud that blots out the light.  
  
Doug says to the camera: ""Oh god, it's... it's bugs! It's a swarm!""  
  
The window pane is rapidly turning OPAQUE from the constant barrage of impacts and resulting GORE. Within seconds, the outside is completely obscured by a thick, black and brownish film.  
  
Doug places the laptop back on the desk, but doesn't sit. He is standing, his breathing ragged, eyes wide with pure terror, staring at the camera. The EMERGENCY ALERT TONE is still blaring from the TV, but it's being rapidly drowned out by the new, overwhelming sound from outside: the deafening ROAR of millions of insects hitting the house. It sounds like a HURRICANE, a constant, percussive DRUMMING on the walls, the roof, the windows.  
  
Doug starts to pace the small area in front of his desk, frantic, running his hands through his hair. He mutters to the camera: ""They're everywhere! They're on the house! What do I do?!""  
  
The SOUND outside intensifies. A high-pitched SCRAPING joins the drumming, the sound of chitinous bodies against wood and glass.  
  
A sickening GROAN comes from the window behind him. The glass PANE visibly BOWS INWARD, flexing under the impossible pressure of the swarm.  
  
Doug says, horrified: ""No... no, no, no..."" He whips around, staring at the window.  
  
Another sickening GROAN. CRACKS spiderweb across the bowing glass.  
  
Suddenly, the LIGHTS in the room FLICKER and DIE. The TV SCREEN goes BLACK, the emergency alert TONE cutting off abruptly. The only light is the faint GLOW from the laptop screen illuminating Doug's terrified face.  
  
The incredible SOUND of the swarm outside continues, now the only sound besides Doug's gasping breaths.  
  
CRACK! The glass in the window SHATTERS inward.  
  
The sound of breaking glass is instantly overwhelmed by a ROARING FLOOD of insects. Black, buzzing, clicking bodies POUR through the broken window opening, a torrent of life.  
  
Doug FLINGS his arms up, stumbling backward away from the desk and the camera. He is immediately enveloped in the mass of the swarm.  
  
His SCREAM is cut off, replaced by a choked, garbled GURGLE as the insects overwhelm him, pouring into his mouth and throat. His body thrashes briefly just outside the edge of the webcam's view, a chaotic, indistinct struggle in the dim light.  
  
The camera view is now mostly filled with a writhing, buzzing carpet of insects pouring across the floor and objects in the room. The SOUND is deafening – a million tiny bodies moving, clicking, buzzing.  
  
Doug's struggling ceases. The garbled sounds stop.  
  
The laptop camera continues to record, pointing at the floor and the encroaching swarm. The sound of the insects fills the audio.  
  
Slowly, the screen FADES TO BLACK.",1,1747425403.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1koa6i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoberLifeProTips/comments/1koa6i2/50_days_sober/,50 Days Sober,"Today marks a significant milestone in my journey: I’ve been sober for 50 days. It’s a moment of reflection and celebration, and I want to share my experience with you. 

I’ve been using the [“I Am Sober”](https://iamsober.com/en/site/home) app to track the days, months, minutes, hours, and seconds. It’s very simple but effective. 

# The Decision to Get Sober

The path to sobriety is often a complex one. For me, it started with a realization that my relationship with alcohol was unhealthy and causing huge things to go wrong in my life. It became clear that I needed to make a change for my mental, emotional, and physical well-being. The decision wasn’t easy, but it was necessary.

# What I’ve Learned in 50 Days

**1. Embracing the Present**

Sobriety has taught me to appreciate the present moment. Without the fog of alcohol, I see the world more clearly. Everyday experiences, like a morning coffee or a walk in the park, have become significant.

**2. Healthy Coping Mechanisms**

In the past, I often turned to alcohol as a way to cope with stress or difficult emotions. Now, I’ve learned healthier strategies, such as exercise, meditation, and connecting with supportive friends and family. It’s empowering to find alternate outlets for my feelings.

**3. Building a Support System**

Having a support system has been crucial in my recovery. Whether it’s friends, family, or a support group, sharing my struggles and triumphs has made a positive difference. Surrounding myself with understanding and encouraging individuals motivates me to stay on track.

**4.** **Rediscovering Hobbies**

Sobriety has freed up time and energy. I’ve taken the opportunity to rediscover past hobbies and try new activities. Whether it’s painting, writing, or hiking, engaging in creative outlets has brought joy back into my life.

# Challenges Faced

Of course, the journey has not been without challenges. There have been moments of temptation and doubt. However, each challenge has taught me resilience and the importance of self-care. Acknowledging cravings without acting on them has been a significant learning experience. 

# What’s Next?

As I celebrate these 50 days, I am motivated to continue my journey. My goal is to build on this foundation of sobriety, embracing each day as an opportunity for personal growth and happiness.

Reaching the 50-day mark is not just a milestone; it’s a testament to hard work, determination, and the desire for a better life. If you’re on a similar journey or considering sobriety, know that change is possible, and it’s never too late to start anew. Here’s to the days ahead—filled with clarity, joy, and endless possibilities!",5,1747425295.0,SoberLifeProTips,1,1.0,False

 I'm always on top of cleaning my dishes but on my way to work sometimes I will grab a coffee cup because I'm late and drink it on the way there and toss the coffee cup in the back of my car. OR I used to now I have to-go cups. So today I cleaned out the coffee mug graveyard; some of them having been there about a year maybe a bit longer. None of them are moldy as everything was dumped out before going to the graveyard,  some are stained by residual coffee, but I fear I need to sanitize them before use again. All are ceramic except I also have a Stanley cup like thing that was also in there. 
I have them soaking in vinegar, hot water, and dish soap right now. Is there anything else I need to do before I wash them in the dishwasher or will they be sanitary enough after the soak to go in my dishwasher? 
I have TONS of coffee mugs so if I have to toss them it's not a total loss lol just a couple of them were kinda cute. 
PS: I have ADHD and OCD which is a horrible combination because out of sight out of mind but once in sight I'm absolutely horrified at what I'm capable of.

Synopsis: Lucanis and Davrin can’t seem to get past their bullshit, and Rook has had enough. Spite remains a menace besotted with Rook. 

CHAPTER EXCERPT:
—————-

“Venhedis, that’s it!” Rook slammed her fists on the table, startling everyone.

Her coffee and sea eyes darted between both of them, annoyance rolling off her in waves. “You two are so damn ridiculous, I’ve can’t take it anymore.” She stood up, grabbed Lucanis’s arm, which he allowed with ease because it’s Rook, and then grabbed Davrin’s arm and hauled him up with a surprise show of strength. The Warden seemed too surprised to do anything other than allow it.

“Honestly, you two are like a pair of stray cats, hissing at each other from across the alley. I’m sick of it, we’re all sick of it.”

“Yeah, it went from being funny to all of us wondering when you’re gonna come to blows pretty quickly,” Taash said, draining the last of her ale.

“That’s exactly what they’re going to do,” Rook said, pulling them toward the door, which automatically opened for her.

On **Thursday, May 15**, I dropped a bunch of **free treasures**—small bags of my own roasted coffee + limited-edition stickers—along the beautiful backroads of **West Marin**. Think **Nicasio, Point Reyes**, and nearby spots I love to ride. It's all part of my project: *50 Rides, 50 Quests, Unlimited Adventure*.

But wait—there’s more!

Back on **Monday, May 13**, I also did a **commuter drop** along my bike ride from **Fairfax to San Rafael**. Those treasures are still out there too… and so far, **nobody has reported finding anything**. 👀

Looking Glass was involved heavily in the Battle of Big Hole.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking\_Glass\_(Native\_American\_leader)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_Glass_(Native_American_leader))

I also really like this spot as it’s Justin’s ideal hiding spot with a big flat area that you need to pass a slow moving river to get to.

Here’s how I got there:

*Can you find what lives in time, Flowing through each measured rhyme?*

Memories of Justin's Life

*Wisdom waits in shadowed sight- For those who read these words just right.*

Start in Wisdom Montana.  “Wisdom waits” gives a clue that Wisdom is waiting for your return on this circular journey.

*As hope surges, clear and bright,  Walk near waters’ silent flight.*

With the excitement of the search.  Start in the morning and go past Jackson hot springs.

*Round the bend, past the Hole,  I wait for you to cast your pole.*

*Big Hole Pass and north to Polaris*

*In ursa east his realm awaits;*

Bears are symbols of strength and wisdom to many Native Americans, and are often associated with healing and medicine.  There are many stories of bear spirit guides.

*His bride stands guard at ancient gates.  Her foot of three at twenty degree,*

I believe the bride is referring to the Bear Mother or Bear Spirit represented by the Wise River.   [https://orderwhitemoon.org/goddess/Bear\_Mother/Bear\_Mother.htm](https://orderwhitemoon.org/goddess/Bear_Mother/Bear_Mother.htm)

The tributary foot of Jacobson at 20 degrees from Polaris.   Jacobson, Mono and Happy Creek make up the 3 feet that are shaped similar to the foot of a sandhill crane.  I believe another interpretation is that the Wise River represents Lady Wisdom, a prominent figure in biblical wisdom literature, as a personification of God's wisdom. 

*Return her face to find the place.*

If you follow the Wise River, the mouth (face) flows into the Big Hole River. The Big Hole River was originally named the Wisdom River by Lewis and Clark before being changed.  I believe Return Her Face refers to the Wise River losing its face of Wisdom.   I believe this is a play on ""to lose face"" as the river was disrespected with the name change.   To return face you need to follow Big Hole back through the town of Wisdom to the headwaters of Skinner Lake.  

I believe in the Netflix special the 2 coffee represent passing Wisdom a second time and then following the clock to Skinner Lake.

*Double arcs on granite bold, Where secrets of the past still hold.*

I believe you need to be BOTG to find this in Skinner Meadow.  If you look at it by satellite, it could be at the entrance of the lake, over to the east, or within a group of trees in the center.  

*Beyond the reach of time’s swift race, Wonder guards this sacred space.*

Skinner Meadows has slow moving waters of the Big Hole River, and is considered sacred by the Nez Perce.  Here’s a description of the pamphlet above:  The headwaters of the Big Hole River, one of Montana’s blue-ribbon trout streams, are found at the base of the Big Hole Divide. As you look at the lush grass and gentle waters of Skinner Meadows, you can easily imagine the Nez Perce or military stopping here to rest.

*Truth rests not in clever minds, Not in tangled, twisted finds,*

*Like a river’s steady flow-What you seek, you already know.*

This setup isn’t cute. It’s legit. For about $50, you can find a solid manual grinder secondhand. The Nanopresso goes for around $70 new, and used ones pop up often. Together, they outperform any machine in this price range that pretends to make espresso but really just wheezes hot water through sad coffee.

The Nanopresso is tiny, durable, and fully manual. It hits 18 bars of pressure without electricity, which is more than some countertop machines can manage. It takes a true espresso grind and rewards you with real crema, not the bubbly stuff faked by pressurized baskets. Pair it with a proper burr grinder, ideally with stepless adjustment, and you get full control over your extraction. Most cheap electric grinders choke at espresso settings and leave you stuck in no man’s land.

You will need to heat your own water. You will need to clean it yourself. But once you get your routine down, it’s actually satisfying. Like pour-over, but with more pressure and more ego. It also travels well. I’ve brought mine on road trips, through airports, and to my in-laws’ house, where drip coffee tastes like despair.

Some people will suggest moka pots, Aeropress, or a machine with a name like “Barista Supremo.” Smile, nod, and move on. If you care about grind size, water temp, and pressure, this setup delivers. It’s not just good for the price. It’s good, period.

1ko9vox,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1ko9vox/my_far_too_long_everything_you_need_to_know_when/,"My far too long ""everything you need to know when visiting South Korea"" trip report","I recently had the opportunity to spend four weeks on holiday in South Korea with my wife. We loved it. And what’s better than to share that love with everyone here? Here is everything i learned from visiting the land of the morning calm, and what you should know as well.

# Context

My wife and I (we’re both in our fourties) traveled around South Korea around April 2025. I mostly limit my tips to ‘things to do and see’, because restaurants and hotels change so quickly. You can read more about how we found lodging and restaurants later in this post.

# TL;DR

All of these points will be elaborated in more detail later on in this post.

*Essentials*

* Bring a **creditcard**.
* Install the **Naver** app.
* Get an eSim with a **dataplan**.
* Get the **T-money card**.

*Itinerary*  
We had four weeks and could have seen much more, there’s just so much to see and explore! These are the cities we visited in the order of recommendation.

* You’ll probably fly in and out of **Seoul**. Seoul is gigantic, and you’ll need at least three full days to see a selection of the most popular sites. There’s something for everyone here.
* **Gyeongju** has an incredible amount of historic things to see, but also has a nice, laid-back atmosphere. Stay here for at least two full days.
* We only went to **Daegu** because we did a **templestay** at the **Donghwasa** **temple** here, which was fantastic.
* **Suncheon** was the biggest surprise for me. Also a nice relaxed atmosphere, a fairly small city, but still lots of nice things to do. 
* **Busan** is good if you like beaches and big cities. It’s a bit bland though. And getting from point A to B with public transport can take a while.
* **Gwangju** is an all-around big city with a couple of nice things to do, but can be skipped if you have little time.
* **Wonju** is very much off the beaten track, but it does have **Museum San**, which is a must-visit if you’re into modern art and architecture. Can also be done as a day trip from Seoul. 
* **Jeonju** is okay. The Hanok village is a bit of a tourist trap (the one in Gyeongju is much nicer) and besides the palace there’s not that much to see here. Also skip if you’re short on time.

We didn’t visit Jeju island so unfortunately i can’t say anything about it.

# Deep dive

Okay, now for the deep dive. Here’s everything you need to know when visiting South Korea.

# What you’ll need / things to know before you go

* A smartphone with an internet data plan is pretty much **essential**. The public transport is amazing, but if you don’t want to get stuck asking questions all the time (and people speak little to no English) and figuring out complicated bus timetables you’ll need a smartphone. 
* Fortunately data plans are easy to buy using the eSIM system (make sure your phone supports that). We got [the one from KT](https://roaming.kt.com/esim/eng/m/main.asp) which, depending on the number of days you stay here, will set you back around 3.000 won (about €2) per day but is totally worth it. You can just get a ‘data-only’ plan, you won’t need a plan that also supports calling. These plans works by sending you a QR code, **which you should scan a day or so before you leave**. They will start from that moment. Make sure to disable the data/roaming setting for your regular plan to avoid high costs. With modern smartphones you can use both your regular SIM and the eSIM at the same time so you can still receive calls and use apps to need access to your regular SIM.
* Once you get to South Korea you’ll **need** one of the major mapping apps. Google Maps doesn’t give you (walking and transport) directions in Korea, so you need either the **Naver** or **Kakao** app. We preferred the Naver app because it tends to have more English texts and labels (although not everything is translated). Kakao can be useful for things you can’t find on Naver. 
* Also very useful is the **Papago** app which translates better to/from Korean than Google Translate. You can also use it to instantly translate images with text to English, like the menus you’ll find in restaurants. 
* The **k.ride** app is kind of like the Korean Uber. You can attach a credit card and enter your destination, making it a bit easier to communicate. Note that you do pay a percentage for using the app. You can also just hail a cab on the street, which is cheaper. Taxis in generals are quite cheap (5000 won for a small ride) and trustworthy. Note that a **red** sign means the cab is free and **green** means occupied!
* We had little luck using our Dutch debit cards in Korean ATM’s so you’ll also need a **credit card**. In most places you can also pay using a credit card.
* The weather can be quite fluky in april! We brought our winter coats which felt like overkill, but in the end they were very useful during the windy hikes along the Busan beach. Make sure to bring clothes that work in all seasons if you’re also going around this time!
* To get around public transport in all cities you’ll need a **T-money card**. You can get these at most metro stations and the Incheon airport. To charge it, the easiest way is to go to any convenience store (GS25, 7-11, CU) and ask the clerk to charge it while handing over cash. Note that you can’t charge a T-money card with a credit card!
* It’s nice to learn Hangul (the Korean script) and not that hard (because it’s an alphabet, like Latin or Cyrillic) and can sometimes be useful. However, virtually all important signs are also translated in English and there’s always the Papago app.
* In general we found Korea super safe to travel around. Of course you always need to use common sense (make sure to keep your important belongings on you, watch out for pickpockets, etc.). But we were never scammed or had the feeling that we’re paying more because we’re Western tourists. 

# Transport

Transport in Korea is amazing, as long as you have the Naver app, a credit card and a T-money card (see under ‘Essentials’). 

*Intercity busses*  
One of the things that surprised me the most is the fantastic **intercity bus network**. We’ve travelled before by bus from city to city in other countries and usually it’s a cheap, but gruelling affair. Confusing timetables and stops, and a lot of hassle to buy tickets.

Not so in South-Korea. Bus stations usually look more like luxurious malls, with loads of places to get food and drinks. There are surprisingly well-designed (English) touch displays where you can buy a ticket, and even select the seat you want. It’s very clear where the busses leave and they usually leave **exactly on time** and **arrive exactly on time**. It’s almost comical: the first time we took a bus (from Seoul to Jeonju) the bus literally arrived 15 seconds before the scheduled time at the destination. There are many bus lanes in the country, so that also helps in speeding up bus traffic.

The busses are also super comfortable. You get three seats in a row, so lots of leg room and free fast wifi. If you select the ‘premium’ option instead of ‘excellent’ you might even got a touchscreen with movies, like on an airplane. 

There is also a train network which is probably excellent as well, but we never used it because the busses were so cheap and comfortable.

It might be wise to buy tickets in advance if you’re going to popular places and there are not that many busses, or traveling on busy moments (e.g. Friday evenings). You can easily reserve / buy tickets in advance from the touch screens in the bus terminals. There’s usually friendly personnel around if you need help.

*Public transport*  
Public transport in cities is usually very good, as long as you have your T-money card and the Naver app. Most cities have extensive bus networks, and the larger ones also have metro lines. You really need the Naver app to understand the bus system. Most busses will call all stops in English and have a screen that shows the stop name in English as well. To check in, simply touch your T-money card when entering the bus and do that again when leaving the bus.

Note that many seats tend to be reserved for the elderly, disabled and pregnant. Using those seats if you don’t fall in those categories will be frowned upon.

City bus drivers tend to drive quite…sporty. So hold on tight whenever you’re standing or walking down the aisle. 

# Where to stay

Korea has many hotels, guesthouses and dorms. We mostly tried to find smaller hotels and guesthouses. If you don’t speak Korean you’re mostly limited to the regular methods (e.g. [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) and AirBnB). Even though we were in cherry blossom season (April) we had little trouble finding accommodation (we only booked the first three nights in advance). It was a bit harder in the weekends, so maybe don’t wait too long with booking your accommodation, especially if there are also public holidays.

Most guesthouses were very clean, comfortable and full of amenities (e.g. a washing machine, a water purifier). One thing that many hotels do lack is a bit of character. IKEA furniture and rooms without any decoration are rampant. You will also encounter many ‘contactless checkins’ where you just get a couple of keycodes and you check yourself in and out. Make sure you have WhatsApp, which tends to be the most common medium of sending you these codes. 

Hotels are pretty cheap compared to most western countries. You can easily find a double in a decent hotel for under 100.000 won (about €60).

# Where to eat and drink

Korea has a crazy amount of restaurants, coffee places and bars. Apparently there’s one coffee house for every 500 inhabitants and one chicken restaurant for every 1500. You’ll have no problem finding good places to eat and drink. Once again, the Naver app is useful here in finding the restaurants of your liking. It also usually has the menu of the restaurant right in the app (or at least a picture of the menu). Naver has a couple of useful filters, including one for restaurants that are friendly for ‘solo diners’. 

We heard from many people that Korea is very meat-centric, which is true but it’s not that hard to find places that focus more on veggies. If you’re a strict vegan or vegetarian it might be difficult, because meat and fish can be used in unexpected places (e.g. the seasoning used in kimchi). 

Some useful things to know when dining:

* Usually you collect your own cutlery. This can be in a hidden drawer in your table, or in a central place in the restaurant.
* Get water at the water cooler for free.
* In the cheaper restaurants you get up and collect your own *banchan* (side dishes).
* Pay at the counter, not at your table. Most places accept credit cards.

In terms of *what* you can eat there’s just *so much* to choose from. Just try something different every night! One way to cheaply try a lot of different dishes at once is going to a ‘buffet restaurant’ (this is also a filter on Naver), which is basically an ‘all-you-can-eat’ restaurant where you can try many different types of food. 

There are places with ‘western food’, but unfortunately they tend to be quite expensive (e.g. double the price of what you pay for Korean food) and usually not that great (finding good pizza is hard). The most common non-Korean food is Chinese and Japanese. Ramen places are everywhere.

Breakfast is not really a thing in Korea. For some reason the Koreans really don’t do ‘European bread’, it’s all quite chewy and sweet to be honest. Don’t be fooled by chains with names like ‘Paris Baguette’, ‘Tous les Jours’ and ‘Oma’s Brötchen’: French and German bakers would cry when they would find out what goes around for bread here. There are some good ‘European-style’ bakers but they are hard to find. We found good bread at a small chain called ‘Butter Bakery’ in Seoul.

One thing the Koreans do very well though is coffee. As mentioned, there’s a coffee place on basically every corner. Most of them conveniently allow you to order from a screen with English translations. Make sure you choose the ‘hot’ option if you don’t want to end up with ice coffee, which is very popular here. There are also an incredible amount of non-coffee drinks like fruit juices, sodas and all kinds of weird contraptions featuring large amounts of sugar, cream and sweet stuff. I think we tried all the major chains and in our humble opinion the best chain is ‘Compose Coffee’, closely followed by ‘Paik’s Coffee’. You usually pay around 4000 won (€2,50) for a big latte. 

# Places

Ok, on to recommendations for the different places that we visited. I tend to write longer about the things that i liked, and less so about the things that i didn’t like that much. The sights at every city are ordered by how much i would recommend them.

# Seoul

Well, Seoul has it all. First of all, it’s gigantic. The metropolitan area is home to around 25 million people (this includes cities like Incheon and Suwon), about half of all Korean people live in this area. Even though it’s gigantic there are many places that don’t feel like ‘giant city’ at all, and it’s easy to get around using the extensive public transport network. Just realise that it might take some time to get from one part of the city to another.

You’ll need at last three full days to explore a couple of the top spots, but you can very easily stay much longer here. We stayed for nine nights. We had a hotel in the Mangwon-dong area (around the Mapo-gu Office and Mangwon metro stops). I can recommend this area. There are loads of nice restaurants and bars, but it ‘s not as busy and touristy as the area around, for example, Hongik University. It’s still very close to most of the sights and you’re also quite close to Incheon airport. Mangwon market is great for sampling lots of different street food. 

*National Museum of Korea*  
This major free museum should be on the top on your list. It has three floors full of amazing Korean historic artifacts and art, in a spectacular building with an amazing view. There are free English tours. It’s very big so be prepared to either spend a lot of time here, miss a lot or go twice.

*Changgyeonggung Palace & Secret garden*  
This is the one palace you should visit in Seoul. The palace ground are more diverse and interesting compared to many of the other palaces in Korea that we’ve seen. I also highly recommend the Secret Garden tour, it’s very beautiful and we had a super funny tour guide. Note that you need to buy tickets for the Secret Garden separately, and it might be wise to reserve them in advance. The palace grounds (not the garden) are free if you are dressed in *hanbok* (traditional Korean clothes) which you can rent in many shops around the palace.

*DMZ* *daytrip*  
Even though you’re kind of paying to listen to propaganda, a tour to the DMZ is something you should do when visiting Korea. Since 1953 the Korean peninsula has been split up in North and South along a “military demarcation line” (MDL), around the 38th parallel north. Around this MDL there is a so-called ‘demilitarized zone’ (DMZ) 2 kilometers north and south. The daytrips actually don’t take you into the DMZ, but just south of it, in yet another ‘zone’ (the civilian control zone, or CCZ).

Commonly these daytrips include a visit to Imjingang park, with dozens of different monuments. “The third tunnel”, which is one of the four discovered tunnels that North Korea allegedly dug for a hostile invasion. The Dorasan observatory, where you get a close look at North Korea. And “Unification village”, the only inhabited village within the DMZ.

It’s all very strange and weird. Even though you’re in a military environment there are ferris wheels, restaurants and lots of discutable souvenirs (who doesn’t want a DMZ fridge magnet?). It kind of feels like being in a David Lynch movie.

There are a couple of different tour operators. We went with [VIP Travel](https://www.vviptravel.com/), which costs us around 70.000 won. Word is that all the tour operators offer more or less the same, and the ‘extra stops’ like the red suspension bridge aren’t worth it.

*Cheonggyecheon Museum and river*  
This is a remarkable free museum dedicated to Seoul and the Cheonggyecheon stream. Once a vital lifeline for the city, the stream became heavily polluted after the Japanese occupation as people flocked to Seoul in large numbers. Over the decades following the war, it was covered over and transformed into a highway. In a fascinating turn of events, it was restored as a river in the early 2000s.

Beyond the museum, the Cheonggyecheon stream itself is also definitely worth a visit, particularly on pleasant days. You can enjoy a relaxing stroll along its banks, and you’ll even find free spots with books available to read.

*National Museum of Korean Contemporary History*  
Close to the Geunjeongmun palace, this free museum has a surprisingly good (English) overview of, unsurprisingly, Korean contemporary history.  A good museum to view early on in your trip, so you get a bit of perspective on how the Korean peninsula evolved. 

*Museum Leeum*  
The private art collection from Samsung is displayed in this futuristic and highly photogenic building (note: entrance fee). Both the modern and traditional permanent collections are great, and there are good temporary exhibitions here as well.

*Arario Museum in Space*  
This is a private (hence: not free) modern art museum, very close to Changgyeongung Palace. I liked the curation of this museum, which focuses on sombre and gloomy art. Definitely not for everyone, but if you like dark art, this is the place for you. Very weird building (it used to be an office space) as well. 

*Museum Kimchikan*  
I thought this would be a tourist trap, but the Kimchi Museum is actually quite good! There’s a lot to see here, and you can even taste different kinds of kimchi! I also highly recommend the excellent vegan kimbap (Korean sushi) place at the ground floor (Maru JaYeonSik Kimbap). 

*Gangnam*  
Gangnam is a large neighborhood on the south bank of the Han river, famous because of the rich inhabitants and of course *that* song by PSY. Gangnam has limited ‘big’ sights, but there are a couple of nice things to see. We liked to walk around the **Seonjeongneung** park and look at the royal tombs. There is the inescapable **Gangnam Style Statue** next to the colossal COEX Mall for the obligatory selfie. And next to the mall there’s the meditative **Bongeunsa temple**. 

*Daytrip to Suwon*  
Suwon is a big city (around 1.2 million residents) about 30 km south of Seoul. It makes for a nice daytrip, there are many options to get here. Things you can visit here are the Haewoojae museum, better known as **Mr. toilet house**, dedicated to …well, you know. You can have a nice stroll around the **old fortress walls** and climb the **Paldalsan mountain** for nice views. The **Suwon Museum of Art** was surprisingly good. A bit more to the west of the centre is the giant **Starfield Suwon** mall which hosts the Instagram-famous **Starfield library**.

*Seoul Museum of Art*  
Another free museum, focusing on modern art. I would say it’s worth it alone for the fabulous work by Korean video artist Nam June Paik in the lobby (one of his last before his passing), but if you’re not that much into art you could skip this one.

*The War Memorial of Korea*  
Another giant free museum about Korean military history. Expect lots of school children, tanks and airplanes. It’s okay to get a bit of historical perspective, but for a better explanation i would recommend the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History instead.

*Other sights in brief*  
**Seoullo 7017** is an elevated park, reminiscent but a lot less charming then the New York High Line, but worth a visit if you’re in the neighborhood. If you’re there anyway you could also visit take a look at the futuristic **Seoul City Hall** and the former city hall which is now the **Seoul Metropolitan Library**. There’s a free rooftop garden with nice views.

If you’re a palace lover you will also probably like the **Geunjeongjeon** palace. On the palace grounds you can visit the fine **National Folk Museum of Korea**. 

*Restaurants*  
There are a bazillion restaurants in Seoul and i recommend you find your own favourite spots, but here a couple that we liked:

* [**Oreno Ramen**](https://naver.me/F9N46JvU). Great restaurant with a good rich chicken ramen. Has a Michelin Bib Gourmand. 
* [**Butter Bakery**](https://naver.me/F75X7SXj). The best “European-style” bread that we had in Korea. Great French-style baguettes.
* [**Itaewon Uyuk Mien**](https://naver.me/xktc864D). Best bulgogi we had in Korea.

# Gyeongju

Gyeongju is a truly lovely city. It’s packed with historical sights just waiting to be explored, and despite being quite popular with tourists, it maintains a relaxed atmosphere. Part of this charm comes from the fact that its central area avoids the ubiquitous concrete high-rise apartment buildings found in many other Korean cities.

One thing that is not so convenient about Gyeongju is the **public transport system**. There are busses to all the major tourists sites, but for some reason they tend to run really infrequently (like once every 60-90 minutes or so) and are hard to comprehend, even with the Naver app. Be prepared to wait for a while, get a cab, or rent your own transportation. 

Some of the most popular sites are the numerous **burial mounds** right in the center of the city, the **Bulguksa** temple up in the mountains and the **Donggung Palace**. 

*Teddybear and rabbit museum*  
This is a pretty weird place that has a giant collection of teddybears and other stuffed animals that are put into ridiculous scenes. Expect quirky photo opportunities with teddybears battling dinosaurs in ancient Korea.

*Namsan mountain*  
There are many walks around this holy mountain, where you can visit countless temples and ancient Buddha statues. A good starting spot for a hike is the Samneung Information Center. I would probably recommend this over the Bulguksa temple if you’re short on time. Bring proper hiking gear. 

*Gyeongju National Museum*  
A large free museum explaining the Silla empire with many artifacts from the burial mounds that are aplenty in the city. Excellent free English tours on Sundays.

*Sendong market*  
This is a giant traditional market in the centre. I highly recommend the excellent buffet stalls where you can eat as much as you like for around 9000 won. A bit hard to find, but definitely worth the effort!

# Daegu

We only went to Daegu to get a bus to the fabolous [**Donghwasa temple**](https://www.templestay.com/en/MI000000000000000062/reserve/view.do?pageIndex=1&areaCd=&templestaySeq=25342&templeBookMarkId=Donghwasa&templeIdTmp=&areaSelect=&templeId=&templePrgType=&searchCnt=&searchStaDate=&searchEndDate=&searchKeyword=donghwasa) up in the mountains to do a one-night **templestay** here, which was amazing. There are templestays all around South-Korea, which can easily be found and booked [at the English website](https://www.templestay.com/en/main/view.do). I think most of them are quite comparable, but in our case we got a simple room with private bathroom. We participated in many of the rituals with the monks, including evening prayer and eating in the communal canteen. One of the highlights was ‘tea time’ with one of the monks, who spoke excellent English. Highy recommended.

# Suncheon

Suncheon was the biggest surprise to me. It’s not on many ‘must-see’ itineraries of South Korea, but it should! It has the same laid-back atmosphere that you also get in Gyeongju, but without all the tourists. Arguably it doesn’t have the same amount of sights that Gyeongju has, but there is enough to see here for at least a full day, and you can easily spend two full days here.

*Suncheon National Gardens*  
The national gardens are the main attraction of the city. Originally opened in 2013, it’s kind of a weird cross between a botanical garden and a theme park. There are lots of cultivated gardens here, but there are also attractions, a pet zoo and a crazy ‘space bridge’. There’s a ‘Sky Cube’, an elevated railway that takes you to the ‘Wetlands’ area in the south of the city. The wetlands are honestly not *that* interesting, but the train ride is kind of fun. 

*Open Set*  
Also known as the Drama Set or Movie Set, this is a large fake city used as a set in many Korean movies. There’s a complete historical town here, but also a more contemporary ‘Korean town’ from the seventies. Lots of silly attraction as well, there’s even a free karaoke booth. 

*Honam Patriots Memorial Hall*  
Surprisingly good museum about the different wars the Koreans fought in. And not that gigantic as the War Memorial in Seoul. Also cool because they have a room with about 20(!) VR helmets and shaking seats that they love to use on foreign tourists.

# Busan

Busan is a giant city, the second largest in Korea after Seoul. It’s stretched out along the southeastern coast. This also means that transport **takes a while**. Taking a bus from one side of the city to the other can easily take 90 minutes or more. Be prepared to spend a lot of time in public transport here. Compared to Seoul i think Busan it’s just a bit…bland. Seoul is more dense and layered, making it more vibrant in my opinion. Still, if you like beaches, coast and nightlife you’ll probably love Busan.

The **Museum of Contemporary Art** was a bit too highbrow for my taste (it’s also pretty far out of the centre). It’s nice to take a stroll in **Gamcheon village**, but it’s also very touristy. The **National Science Museum** is okay, little information in English here although the exhibits look spectacular. 

*Haedong Yonggungsa*  
Even though this temple is *very* touristy, it’s definitely worth it. This temple is built on a spectacular site, on the cliffs next to the sea. We were there on a grey rainy day, and even then it was amazing. 

*Igidae Coastal Trail*  
You can make a beautiful hike here along the coast line. The route is very accessible, lots of well-designed steps and bridges and stunning views. Highly recommended.

*UN Memorial Cemetery*  
Pretty close to the coastal trail is this cemetery for UN soldiers who died during the Korea war (1950 – 1953). It’s a meditative and respectful experience which i can highly recommend as well.

# Gwangju

Gwangju is your typical ‘big-but-its-not-seoul-or-busan’ Korean city. The city itself is not very inspiring, but it has a couple of nice sights that could fill a day or two. If you’re short on time i would skip Gwangju.

*Museums*  
There is a cluster of three large museums in the northwestern corner of the city: the **National Gwangju Museum,** the **Gwangju Art Museum** and the **Gwangju Folk Museum**. Honestly i can’t remember much from them so they’re probably not that amazing. The **National Museum** had a couple of interesting items (although you’ll probably see similar items in the **National Museum of Korea** in Seoul). The **Folk Museum** had a robot that can be your tour guide, which was kind of fun.

*Penguin Village*  
This is a small neighbourhood around the Yangnimgyo bridge in the southeast part of town. It’s quite pleasant to have a little stroll there and admire the mural art and check out the small shops and bars.

*Mudeungsan National Park*  
A park that’s easy to reach by public transport and where you can do many different hikes. I would recommend taking the **1187** **bus** and get out at Mudeungsan National Park / Wonhyosa temple.

# Jeonju

Jeonju was okay in my opinion. Definitely skippable if you’re short on time. The historical **Hanok village** mostly consists of restaurants, guesthouses and snack joints, it doesn’t feel very ‘historical’ to be honest. For some reason we visited **Deokjin park**, which you can certainly skip. 

*Gyeonggijeon shrine and Royal Portrait Museum*  
Right next to the Hanok village and worth the effort. Especially the portrait museum has interesting exhibitions and has a couple of really fun things to do for children.

*Jeonju National Museum*  
Excellent museum, with lots of information signposted in English. Next doors History Museum is a bit rundown and shows it age, but it’s free so you can have a look if you’re there anyway.

# Wonju

Let’s be frank: Wonju is not on any Korean itinerary. The main reason we visited this place is because we wanted to visit **Museum SAN**, which is kind of a must-visit if you’re into modern art and architecture. Still, Wonju was surprisingly nice and i can easily recommend this place as a stopover for a night if you’re traveling from Gyeongju to Seoul. Wonju and Museum SAN can also be done as a daytrip from Seoul. 

This section is a bit more verbose and specific because there’s a lack of good tourist information about Wonju in English.

*Wonju City Tour Bus*  
An excellent way to see Wonju is by using the [**Wonju City Tour Bus**](https://www.wonju.go.kr/english/contents.do?key=4636&). This is a hop-on hop-off bus that stops at the major sights, like Museum SAN and the suspension bridge area. For 5000 won (\~€3) you’ll get a wristband that allows you unlimited travel on the bus and 20% discounts on all the sights. The bus doesn’t run very often (about once every hour per stop) so you need to time it a bit, but it’s the best way to get to the sights if you don’t have your own car, and a lot cheaper than getting cabs. 

Every stop has a scheduled timetable, so you can time your stops very well. You’ll also get a free lecture when you’re in the bus which unfortunately will be in Korean. Also note that the tour bus doesn’t run on Mondays (when Museum SAN is closed anyway). There are multiple stops in the city, including one at the bus terminal and the train station. 

[*Museum SAN*](https://www.museumsan.org/eng/guidance/view_guide.jsp?m=5&s=1)  
So, the main reason we visited Wonju is this museum. It opened in 2013 and is designed by the famous Japanese architect Tadao Ando. Just the building itself is worth the visit, it’s set on a pretty dramatic mountain top and has spectacular views from within the building. One of the main attractions is a collection of four light works by the American artist James Turrell. There is also a permanent exhibition about Korean paper, a meditation hall and multiple sculpture gardens.

Entrance is a bit expensive. You’ll pay at least 23.000 won (€14) for the ‘basic ticket’, 39.000 (€24) if you also want to see James Turrell and 46.000 (€28) for everything. Remember though that you’ll get a 20% discount if you’ve got the city tour bus bracelet. The museum cafetaria is also very expensive (around 10.000 won for a simple coffee) so bring your own lunch or eat somewhere else if you want to save money.

[*Sogeumsan Suspension Bridge*](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/whereToGo/locIntrdn/rgnContentsView.do?vcontsId=64457)  
This is another main sight of Wonju (and stop on the bus tour). It’s the largest pedestrian suspension bridge in Korea, with a length of 200 meters. We didn’t have enough time to see the bridge, but the area around it is also very nice, with lots of small shops and restaurants around the river. There’s also an impressive looking cable car you can take towards the bridge.

Another ‘attraction’ in the same area is an [abandoned railway station](https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%84%ED%98%84%EC%97%AD). It apparently was in use as a tourist attraction where you can cycle up and down the abandoned train tracks using special carts, but that attraction has, sadly, been abandoned as well.

*Other things in Wonju*  
There is the free Wonju history museum which i guess might be interesting if you can read Korean (there was very little signage in English). There is a nice museum garden, which includes a replica of the childhood home of former president Choi Kyu-hah, who was born in Wonju.

There’s a pleasant park around the river in the centre of the city, around the 치악교 bridge.

I can also recommend to stroll around the Wonju Jungang market for a bit.

I have been dealing with the issue of fluctuating levels of stimulation. Early in the morning I want to avoid all stimulation and would gladly use violence to make people shut up.

Then as the day goes on i start running short on stimulation juice and i go into understimulation mode, and at that point I'm just seeking out whatever i can find to give my brain some tingles, be it coffee, sugar, alcohol, whatever i can get away with. When I can't stimulate myself I start building pressure like a rice cooker until I just start doing whatever I can to induce adrenaline, like reckless driving or just running up a sweat.

That bolt/screw in the middle that holds the plastic feeder piece? Make sure that is screwed in tight enough to the point where there is no play. You may need to lodge something into the hole / burrs to have enough counter pressure to torque it well enough. 

See, mine came from the factory such that the middle screw was a bit loose and I could see it wiggling a bit while grinding. I thought that was intended, and over-tightening would cause an issue with the rotation. 

Over time, my espresso went from acceptable to awful. Everything was just sharply, unpleasantly bitter and extractions seemed a bit random at times. I ruled out every variable I could before I decided to clean the machine and, more importantly, tighten that screw all the way in. 

Bro, my grind size with the same exact beans I used the day prior went from 24 clicks to 17 clicks, and the taste of the coffee improved to an insane degree. I’ve never pulled shots this tasty. It changed everything. So yeah, ymmv, but, this made a tremendous difference in how the grinder performed for me. 

Edit: I’ve also ruled out that it could’ve been recalibration, because my first go-around experiencing this, the screw loosened back up after a few shots and immediately it started demanding way coarser grinds to achieve similar flow as before, and the coffee went back to tasting worse. I re-tightened much more the second time and observed same improvement. This was in the same day, same beans, same dose. ",1,1747424191.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1ko9phj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1ko9phj/why_dirty_labs_bioliquid_laundry_detergent_review/,Why Dirty Labs Bio-Liquid Laundry Detergent Review Is a Game-Changer for Eco-Friendly Cleaning?,"The Dirty Labs 110116 Signature Scent Bio-Liquid Laundry Detergent impressed me when I decided to test it in my weekly routine. As someone dealing with laundry every single day (thanks to a house filled with kids, pets, and my own knack for spilling coffee), having a reliable detergent is essential. This one stood out with its promise of being hyper-concentrated and environmentally friendly, while also boasting a scent described as Magnolia, Bergamot, and Cedar. With high hopes, I decided to put this promising product to the test.

**Effective Cleaning Performance**

I was genuinely curious about whether this detergent could handle serious stains, considering it markets itself as both gentle and technologically advanced. Surprisingly, it didn’t disappoint. I tested it on some grimy post-soccer-match socks and spaghetti-sauce-stained napkins (yes, life is messy here). The results were fantastic. The enzyme-based Phytolase technology seemed to work wonders, particularly on odor removal. Tossing my kids' sports jerseys into the wash no longer required adding half a bottle of fabric freshener afterward. What’s even better? The product managed to tackle these inherently tough stains on a cold water setting, saving energy in the process.  

[Check Dirty Labs 110116 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b09b7ys1vk/)

**Scent That Isn't Overwhelming**

Many detergents tend to overpower with sugary or synthetic fragrances, and while the idea of Magnolia, Bergamot, and Cedar sounded lovely, I was worried it might be overdone. After the first load, I was relieved. The scent is light and balanced. I tossed a clean sweater into the care of my sister (an asthmatic who avoids harsh smells), and she gave it her seal of approval. It left my laundry smelling subtle yet luxurious, without triggering anyone’s sensitivities.

**Environmental Commitment**

Dirty Labs doesn’t just clean my laundry; it claims to help the planet too. Reading about their efforts to create hyper-concentrated formulas in recyclable aluminum bottles gave me hope for a less wasteful world of household products. As someone who tries to minimize environmental impact (while still keeping the family in clean clothes), this is a big win. With small dosages—8 ml for a medium load, according to the instructions—they've managed to make each 21.6-ounce bottle last for up to 80 loads. I marveled at both the practicality and sustainability factor.

**Upsides**

- Hyper-concentrated formula lasts for 80 loads per bottle.  
- Unique enzyme technology effectively tackles both stains and odors.  
- Light, fresh scent suitable for sensitive noses or skin.  
- Recyclable aluminum bottles contribute to a reduced carbon footprint.  

**Areas of Concern**

Yet, with all these positives, there are a few minor shortcomings I noticed.  

- The detergent isn’t the most convenient for heavy, industrial-type stains. Spilling motor oil during a garage clean-up was beyond its scope.  
- The lack of a built-in measuring cap was frustrating at first. I had to separately purchase a silicone beaker to measure accurately.  
- Given that it’s hyper-concentrated, accidental over-pouring can lead to wasted detergent if you aren’t careful.

**Challengers in the Market**

This isn’t my first dip into the world of ""green"" detergents. Brands like Seventh Generation and Method have been my go-to options in the past. Compared to Seventh Generation, Dirty Labs wins on fragrance and packaging. However, Seventh Generation remains slightly better at handling grease-heavy stains. On the other hand, Method offers a similar level of gentleness and environmental consciousness, but it lacks the hyper-concentration benefit, so you end up using more detergent per load.  

The Signature Scent laundry detergent does shine in terms of lightweight packaging and its ability to pack an impressive cleaning punch in minimal liquid doses. It’s a fantastic niche solution for households that prioritize eco-friendly qualities while keeping day-to-day messes in check.

**Bang for the Buck**

Judging the value proposition of this laundry detergent boils down to considering its longevity, eco-friendly design, and efficiency. Compared to the cost-per-load of some mass-market alternatives, Dirty Labs performs admirably due to its concentrated format. That means you will use less with each load, making it less of a frequent purchase. If you're someone who values sustainability and clean formulations, it feels like a smart investment. On the flip side, it may not be the first choice for a family working on a tighter budget looking for the largest quantity possible.

I'm looking for some life advice regarding my current situation. So for context, I grew up with an abusive father who would regularly beat my mum, brother, and I. My mum eventually married another guy (my step-father). However, despite him being much richer and provided a lot of good opportunities for me, he was also abusive just in different ways.

This man was both physically and mentally abusive. There have been many instances of him kicking, punching, and threatening me when I was a teenager. He would make threats to not pay for my school or to send me back to my father who I haven't been in contact with for over a decade if I don't follow his orders. One time when I was 13, I had not signed a painting that I was going to sell. In response, he threatened to stop paying for my education if I didn't sign it. This made me quit painting which was my biggest passion at the time. He also drank everyday, a beer for lunch, wine for dinner, and whiskey before bed. On new years eve, when he was driving me back home on his bike, he decided to intentionally run the bike into a family who was walking on the sidewalk. Fortunately he missed his target, but the bike crashed with me on it. As you can tell, my childhood wasn't very fun.

My mum would always defend him as he was our only source of income and also because she loves him. She would always tell me to apologize so that I can go to school again and that I should smile more when speaking to him. This created a riff between my mum and I. I never really felt any love for her or any of my family. While I care for her, I still can't seem to understand the love that a child would have for their parents.  Despite this, I never hated her because I understood the sacrifices that she made for me to have a better future.

When I was 15, I moved to a new country and lived by myself. This gave me a lot of time to think and to finally have a childhood. Now I'm 20, living with my girlfriend, and life is good. But we live in the same town as my parents. After a lot of thinking, I told mum that from today until the day that my step-father dies, I will not be stepping foot in my childhood home again. My mother and I would meet from time to time for coffee or when she wants bring me food but I would not show up to family events. My brother eventually confronted me when he invited us out for dinner and it turned into a heated argument. I don't care about him, as he was decided to leave the household and live with grandparents when he was thirteen and I was six because he didn't like living with my step father.

I don't know what kind of answers I'm actually looking for. I've seen too much violence and hate in my life. I've seen many of my friends die and too many goodbyes. I don't hate anybody, I just want a quiet life with the people I actually care about. I'm happy with my life now, I just don't appreciate my brother condemning me for my actions when I'm trying to keep my peace. It took me a long time learn to be happy and I don't want to compromise it for anybody anymore.

Thank You for reading through this, again not sure exactly what answers I'm looking for but I guess just some comments or insights would be just fine.",1,1747423938.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1ko9moj,https://i.redd.it/utsyujhb471f1.jpeg,Cozumel Mexico Honeymoon - Post Trip,"Wanted to share our honeymoon details as we had an absolute blast. I know many of you may be looking for some ideas.

We flew from San Antonio into Cozumel, Mexico. 45 min flight to Houston, then ~2 hours into Cozumel. The vast majority of the following was planned ahead of time. While she planned the wedding, I did this lol. 

Day 1
Flew in, kicked back at the hotel, and got some rest. We stayed at the Westin Cozumel. Really nice place. About $350/n. They have an all inclusive option, but I went with the middle route offering free breakfast and 20% resort food and drinks. We also had the penthouse (top floor, huge balcony). Incredible view of the Caribbean. Food and drinks were excellent. 

Day 2
Rented a jeep through HTL Rentals and circled the island. Drove to Punta Sur eco park, climbed a lighthouse, and she drank margaritas at their beach club area. I didn’t drink this day since I was driving, so play it safe. This was so much fun and really got us comfortable with the island. Quite remote on the south side and tons of nature. Never felt in danger, just have to avoid the scooter folks while downtown. 

Day 3
We went to the Cabanna Beach, an unbelievably nice beach club connected to the Chankanaab park. Private cabanna, with food and drinks. Incredible snorkeling - and I did a dive. (Through an incredible cave). In the evening we went to Buccanos, a nice restaurant within walking distance from the Westin.

Day 4
Went into town, got our souvenirs and did some people watching (the cruise shippers mainly). Around 4 o’clock we went on a private sunset sailing trip on a beautiful catamaran. The company is called Windseekers. While it was a bit expensive, it was well worth the incredible experience. It was a surprise for her, and she just about cried when we boarded the catamaran.

Day 5
We went fishing with Aqua ventures. They picked us up right off of the Westin dock I caught about 10 mahi-mahi and a black fin tuna. After an afternoon nap, we went back into town for a coffee and some appetizers and drinks from a few restaurants. Lots of really good food on the island.

Day 6
We kicked back at the hotel went to the spa did some snorkeling at the beach in front of the hotel. Saw tons of sea life, including stingrays, eels, lobsters, and dozens of fish species. For dinner we went back to buccanos and watching the sunset along with about a dozen of their unbelievable cocktails.
 
Day 7
Our last day, we went for a morning swim, and then took a taxi to the airport. A sidenote… If you’re looking at Cozumel, try to find a flight that flies directly and then you don’t have to mess with Cancun transportation and the ferry ride. It was so much easier to fly in this very small airport on the island.

I highly recommend Cozumel as a honeymoon destination from the US. Relatively short flights with lots of offer, but still an incredibly relaxing vibe. If you have any questions about the island, or anything we did, feel free to ask. We always felt safe, everyone was friendly, and got by just fine with USD.

Enjoy your trip! Remember to plan ahead so you can truly kick back and roll with your itinerary. Glad I did!

I tracked cost to the best of my ability and estimate about $7,000. You could definitely do it for half the price - if you don’t stay in a penthouse suite, go on a private sailing trip, and eat it very nice restaurants.

1ko9m8v,https://blackvault.co.nz,[SaaS] I built BlackVault to fix a glaring problem in email security ($39 NZD/mo),"After 20 years in email security, I've seen a consistent pattern: organizations spending big money on fancy security suites while leaving their front door unlocked. The industry keeps selling complicated reactive frameworks instead of focusing on the fundamentals.

# The Problem

The cybersecurity industry has created an artificial complexity barrier that serves providers more than clients. Organizations face brand impersonation and phishing risks because they haven't properly implemented basic email authentication protocols - often because it's presented as more complex than it actually is.

# My Solution: BlackVault

I built BlackVault to demystify email security and make it accessible. No BS, no unnecessary complexity.

What it does:

1. Free Email Security Check - Scans your domain, gives you an instant assessment of your vulnerabilities, and explains them in plain English
2. BlackVault Monitoring ($39 NZD/mo) - Watches your email authentication 24/7 and alerts you when something breaks (because it will). This matters because often multiple departments or companies have access to your DNS zone file, and one typo can break these records, rendering your front door unlocked.

The UI is designed so you don't need a cybersecurity degree to understand what's going on - clean, straightforward, and actually useful.

# Current Features

Our scans currently check all the critical email authentication protocols:

* SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
* DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
* DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)
* DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)
* ARC (Authenticated Received Chain)
* BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification)

# Coming Soon

* MTA-STS and TLS-RPT support
* Multi-domain management
* Multi-tenant / Enterprise version for MSPs

# Why $39/mo is Actually Reasonable

For context, most businesses spend thousands on complex security products while leaving email authentication vulnerable. $39/month is less than most companies spend on coffee in a day, and it protects your brand from being impersonated in phishing attacks.

One successful phishing attack costs companies an average of $4.5M - we're offering 24/7 monitoring of your digital front door for a tiny fraction of that.

# Try It Out

You can read more details here: [https://www.blackveil.co.nz/products/blackvault-lite](https://www.blackveil.co.nz/products/blackvault-lite)

Let me know what you think - especially about the approach of making security tools more approachable. Is the industry's complexity helping or hurting?

I know the natural thing to do is to find another job. Unfortunately for now this is my only option because I have a sick mother and we live near the airport. Also, the wages here are better. I need these money. I tried to report one time but nothing happened. I guess I am just a coffee shop girl.

I heard many stories about pilots being flirty and having a girl in every city. But honestly for these past 6 months I have been working here, they were acting like they cannot get la...id. Noting charming or seductive. Just vulgar, disrespectful and they cannot accept I am not interested. And this other girl had the same experience. I don't know how true are the stories that women are all over them because they really act like they don't know how to talk to women

Went out for a coffee with his friends, joked and laughed with them. He even said hi and good mornings to everyone who were in the street that day. 

I woke up, preponed my 9am call to 8am. Before I got on call, I asked my dad if he could pass me the toothpaste after asking him where do we eat breakfast today. Wow! Thinking about it, it was the last thing I spoke to him. Around 8:50am, I heard s heavy breathing sound from the utility area, I took a peep from where I was. I found my dad unconscious on the floor. I started screaming ""Nanna!"" (Dad in telugu) Rushed to him. My mom (was down with fever) and sister who were in the rooms, came to the place where my dad was. I pulled him up straight, made him sit upright. Tried waking him up by gently slapping his cheeks. No response. My mom splashed water on his face. No response. 

I asked my sister to go call for help. She went the neighbours panicking asked them to help us. Meanwhile, I pulled him that small congested place to an open place so he could breath. My neighbours arrived they pulled him to the living. Meanwhile I took my car out and was ready to take him the hospital, coz the ambulance were asking too many questions. 

We reached the hospital and they tried CPR and that's when the tragedy struck my family. We lost him. My world shattered. The floor under my feet was shaken.  My life changed. 

The first thing I was told was to ""Be brave and strong. You're the elder daughter"". That's it. I had to deal with my emotions later and take charge of everything. My mom and sis were a mess. 

Till today not a day goes by without crying for him to come back. Well, I let him go only so he could come back to our lives soon. We made too many plans, he shouldn't have left us so early and quickly. 

After all this one thing is still confusing, why my dad? Why my family? And why me?

 I have lost faith in God and I will only pray for my dad. I will carry him in my heart everyday, all the time.

I've been trying to find a short sci-fi story a teacher read in school for years, with no luck. It is not anything Ray Bradbury, but had the cadence of a sci-fi story written in his era.

The premise is a man having called five(maybe four?) humans to a meeting room along with his butler, thinking he has caught an alien saboteur. They sit around a table and the room is lit with four or five candles.

They're on another planet, maybe Mars. I think there had been animosity between the humans and aliens, but a truce was in place. The man talks about a school bus that had exploded prior, perhaps years ago, full of school teachers, and that it had been done by an alien. I can't remember if this was known, or if he had figured it out.

The man goes on to explain the aliens can disguise themselves, but he found out that by injecting a certain chemical into them, their eyes glow in the dark. He tested this on an alien corpse, which one of the suspects states isn't allowed by the truce (or something). 

The human goes on to say that he's put the chemical in the coffee they've been drinking, and that he's an excellent shot; he has a gun and is going to shoot out the flames one by one, using the last bullet to shoot the person whose eyes are glowing. 

After shooting all the candles, he is shocked to see all their eyes glowing, and he cries for his butler to help. The butler says the wham line, which is something like ""I cannot, for my eyes, too, glow in the dark,""(or see, i cant remember) revealing that even he was an alien all along.",5,1747423367.0,whatsthatbook,1,1.0,False

1ko9egy,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1ko9egy/going_beyond_surviving/,Going Beyond Surviving,"This game plays differently in early, middle, and late game. Early game survival is the first thing you learn. However, to survive the late game, then you need to strategise for it from the beginning, work at it in the middlegame, and then your late game is fairly easy. It is totally normal to not understand this strategy and die, so please don't beat yourself up. Don't get married to any one survival run, just keep learning and try again. If you think about your strategy in between runs, then you can figure out what i am going to tell you. However, i will give you tips if you choose to proceed. 

...Spoilers Warning...i try to keep the advice general to not spoil too much, but really all advice spoils a little. Most the spoilers are in number 6. 1-5 are light spoilers. 

1) Take notes using your journal. List everything you leave at any location and make it a habit. I know, you don't want to, but it will be worth it. Future you will be thankful for this work. 

2) Learn to hunt big game effectively (moose, bear). This is essential to long term survival and once you start killing big game, then you are past the early game IMHO. Even better to learn to take down big game with a bow, because you will then know how to survive on higher difficulty. Hunting big game also gives you material to craft the hyde clothes, which are the best in game. Those clothes give you the best clothing warmth bonus and armor, so it is very important to long term survival. If you want to practice killing big game then try the bear killing challenge. 

3) build stockpiles of food and water at several strategic locations (bases). You need about 1 per region, so you can travel safely between those bases without carrying large amounts of stinky food and/or heavy water. Also, you can store tools, pots, and firewood at each location and then you dont need to carry so many things back and forth. Remember to keep taking notes. It helps to have several pots. It helps to use two fires at once or a big six burner stove. You can do this while your tired BTW. The tired damage is very slow.

4) learn to manage your resources. Matches, firewood, ammo, petroleum, gun cleaner, sharpener blocks, cloth, scrap metal, tools, etc..Early game you just gather everything, but middle and late game requires you to know your priorities. If you run out of something it can spiral into a tough situation, so get a handle on how fast you are using each resorce and plan accordingly. This is hard to understand without experience, but try to set a minimum amount for each resource, and then if you go below your minimum then that resorce becomes a priority. Similar to the lien manufacturing model, there is a correct amount of stock for each resorce. Deciding what the correct amount is varies per player and your experience. 

5) make better plans. The moment you get back to base and start putting your loot away, then start planning your next day. Have a good weather and bad weather plan. Also, plan your next adventure. I often list out possible adventures in my journal and then think about it while I do base duties. Once you have the adventure decided, then pause the game, close your eyes, and really visualize yourself doing it from start to finish. This visualization will help you gear yourself correctly for your adventure. It sounds silly, but this small change in my gameplay saved me so many mistakes. Are you climbing? then think about coffee, crampons, etc. Are their timberwolfs, then think flares. Are their bobcats? then think petroleum or Firestarter for a quick campfire. Do you go to craft something? then visualize it and this will insure you have what you need. Sorry to go on about this but it was a big help for me.  Too many stupid mistakes before I started doing this. 

---spoilers---

6) misc advice: learn to fish with tip ups, learn how to make ammo, and how to use the mill. Get real good with the bow, because it helps a lot. Learn to build and use the meat cure box. Get to level 5 cooking ASAP.

The difficulty of the end game is really up to your performance in the early and mid game. Late game can be so easy it is almost boring. This long-term planning for resources skills is probably the most transferable skill to real-life survival. Good luck.",3,1747423293.0,thelongdark,1,1.0,False

As soon as we sat down with our coworkers for the first time, Ally - the most senior member of the team, immediately lets us know how horrible our boss is. How we have to watch out for ourselves, and be aware of the hypocrisy and stupidity. She laid it on pretty thick, making it seem like we made the worst possible decision by getting hired. 

There was a moment of “uh oh” between me and Nancy about what clusterfuck of a job we landed ourselves in.

Then we discovered that Ally does absolutely nothing all day. 

Since we have flexible hours (7-10 to 3-6), she clocks in at 7 waits 3 hours doing absolutely nothing, then goes on a “coffee break” at 10 when our boss clocks in, and doesn’t return until 1 which coincides with our lunch hour. She then returns to do 1-2 hours of work and clocks out at three. We have 4 major events we host throughout the year, Ally plans her vacations to coincide with it. 

Honestly, we commended her on “sticking it” to our boss and cheesing her way through work. Why break your back over someone who is clearly “horrible”. (Our boss is a bit much sometimes, temperamental and moody, but not completely unmanageable).

Then the annual evaluations came in, and Ally became hysterical. She’s gotten 1s across the board. Her bonus becomes critically impacted. 

She throws a fit, notifying the head of HR and letting anyone with a sympathetic ear know the injustice that was committed.

She tells us she’s applying elsewhere, that she’s done with this job. She goes from at least partially working, to nothing at all. She comes to work to collect a paycheck and that’s it.

The new year rolls around (shockingly, she never got a job offer), and our first major event of the year is coming up. Like clockwork, she puts forth her vacation. But this time, it gets rejected. 

Thus ensuring another fit and cry over the injustices. Ally has already booked. Everything is paid for. Her husband got his time off approved. Another trip to the head of HR. 

Ally gets to go on her trip, personally approved by HR, and she’s smug upon her return. HR told her she’s getting a new boss, and gleefully tells us about how our boss is clearly going to be replaced. 

This didn’t end up happening. Instead, HR tells us how our department will split into two. They are looking to transfer half the team to the new department.

Coincidentally, a different coworker is being let go during a round of layoffs.

Ally thinks this is her moment. She signs up to transfer to the new department, and she is convinced this will make our boss fight for her. After all, it would only be me and Nancy, the two newest and most inexperienced members left. Obviously, our boss would fight tooth and nail to keep her than have the department shrink down to just two people.

Except our boss doesn’t take the bait and personally approves the transfer. Ally is notified by HR via email.

Another fit ensues. Our department was originally something like the “A and B Dept.” and now A and B are separated. Well, Ally based her entire career on B and not A. She thinks A is entirely in a different field (it’s not really), and that HR has condemned her to an early career death of stagnation. Completely forgetting that she literally signed up for it in the first place. 

She goes down to HR, again, who is no longer willing to hear her out. She comes crying to us and we try to be sympathetic but we have actual work to do. 

She ends up having a new GM for that department, and he’s not so willing to accept the extended coffee and lunch breaks. He gets to work just as early as she does and makes sure to send her some work to do that keeps her busy, much to her horror. ",24,1747422947.0,coworkerstories,2,1.0,False

1ko96in,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ko96in,Floor plan & diagram of Rock's residence in the manga (Volume 10),"An explanation of the images: the first three photos are what I drew based on various panels throughout Chapters 84 & 85 (Volume 10) in Rock's residence. The quick background is that Feng Yifei brought an extremely drunk Revy to Rock's place, and Rock and Feng had a conversation about their respective life paths while Revy tried to quell her alcohol sickness in the shower/bathroom.

Another important note is that Rock's place in Volume 10 is different from Rock's place in the anime. In Episode 19, Rock claims that his anime residence is a hotel room, and we see him again in the hotel room in Episode 26 (for further details and not to self-promo but, 2 weeks or so ago I [wrote an article](https://lagooncompany.fandom.com/wiki/Rock's_hotel_room) detailing Rock's hotel-room/residence as well as a brief inclusion of the manga residence, if you wish to browse). We do have a blueprint of sorts of Rock's hotel room via the anime settei, but we lack one for Rock's manga residence. The anime settei for Rock's residence can be [viewed here](https://imgur.com/a/black-lagoon-settai-8HTlIgr) (the images titled ""Rock's Apartment 1"" and ""Rock's Apartment 2""; thanks to user Voteins for those uploads).

Accordingly, I was interested in drawing out a diagram based on the chapter panels, so I put it onto paper. First I drew a rough draft in Microsoft Paint and then I drew the final drafts on printer paper. To describe the contents of Rock's place in the manga, he has a range, a small fridge, a coffee table, an armchair, a three-seated sofa, and a CRT TV with some unknown furniture beneath it. However, the two rooms we see are a living room w/hallway and a bathroom, but no bed appears in what panels are available to us. There could be another room attached to the corner left of the armchair.

Of the three photos I drew, the top-view floor plan is to scale, which I measured via the tiles on the floor and ceiling compared to the surrounding furniture. The second and third drawings are not to scale but I portrayed it as accurately as possible. We virtually have no good view of the inside of the bathroom, so that's up for speculation. For the two doors, the door is mostly based on the bathroom door, although the two doors seem to have the same appearance. The doorknob for the entrance door is probably on the left (from inside perspective), but I admittedly am not sure of whether or not the entrance door opens inward or outward; it appeared inward to me hence that detail on the floor plan.

On Hiroe's end, there are some physical inconsistencies as the two chapters progress, i.e., an object disappearing from where it should be. The TV would disappear from a subsequent panel in the spot where it should be, or the drawn window blinds behind the armchair are suddenly closed without indicating that Rock did so. With that in mind, I drew the blueprints with fixed settings.",8,1747422727.0,blacklagoon,1,1.0,False

1ko94fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1ko94fg/explore_if_the_psiida_ta1428_toaster_is_worth/,Explore if the PSIIDA TA1428 Toaster is Worth Buying Review Now,"The PSIIDSAN TA1428-UL toaster has been part of my morning routine for the past couple of months, and testing it daily has been both insightful and, frankly, a little fun. I was initially drawn to it because of its sleek, modern design and the idea of a touchscreen toaster intrigued me. Though it performs quite well and is packed with features, there are a few things you should know if you’re considering adding it to your kitchen.

**Modern Stainless Steel Design with Bright LCD Display**  
The first thing that stands out about this toaster is how premium it looks. With its stainless steel finish, it feels solid, modern, and like it belongs in an upscale kitchen. The large color LCD screen is not just for show—it's bright, responsive, and lets you navigate the various settings seamlessly. My favorite aspect is the digital countdown timer on the display, which is surprisingly handy. It lets me know when my toast will pop up, meaning I can multitask, whether that’s checking emails or prepping coffee.  

[Want PSIIDSAN TA1428-UL? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b0dzxxj91d/)

**Performance: Quicker and More Even Toasting**  
This toaster is a beast when it comes to evenness, and I’ll give credit to its 900 watts of power for that. No more the frustration of one side of the bread being perfectly golden while the other is pale or burnt; this one gets it perfect almost every time. Even when I used frozen waffles or bagels straight out of the freezer, they came out evenly toasted—no cold spots to be found. Whether you only need one slice or two, the machine’s even-heating technology never disappoints, which is a huge plus for anyone who hates inconsistency in their breakfast routine like me.

**Memory Function: Simplifying Breakfast Routine**  
What really sets this toaster apart is its memory function. I’m not a morning person, so the ability to program my preferred bread type and shade level, and have the machine remember that, is fantastic. One tap on the touchscreen, and it does exactly what I want without tweaking the settings every single time. It’s a little thing, but mornings are so much better when you don’t have to think too hard about how dark your toast should be.  

**Wide Slots for Versatility**  
This toaster is pretty versatile, accommodating more than just bread. Its 1.5-inch-wide slots handle bagels, muffins, pastries, and thicker slices of artisan bread effortlessly. I loved toasting anything from sourdough to my nephew’s frozen pancakes. The various settings, like a dedicated defrost mode and reheat function, work like a charm. It keeps the bread from drying out and maintains the perfect level of crispness without over-toasting. For anyone experimenting with different toasting items, this aspect alone makes it an excellent addition to your appliances.

**Boons:**  
- Bright, easy-to-navigate touchscreen display.  
- Consistent toasting results thanks to 900-watt power.  
- Memory function saves time by recalling previous toast preferences.  

**Potential Pitfalls**  
Despite its strengths, nothing’s perfect. The stainless steel surface, for instance, gathers fingerprints too easily. It looks stunning at first, but after a couple of days, it gives off a slightly messy vibe unless wiped regularly. Cleaning may not be a big deal, but smudges annoy me. Additionally, while the touchscreen is bright and responsive, it felt excessively sensitive at times. A light accidental touch can tweak your settings, which becomes annoying when you’re half-asleep and need coffee before anything else.  

- The stainless steel finish is prone to smudges.  
- Overly sensitive touchscreen can lead to unwanted setting adjustments.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Compared to the Cuisinart CPT-180 Metal Classic Toaster, this one edges ahead in design and features. While the Cuisinart toaster offers dual control panels for different settings on each side, it lacks the touchscreen interface and memory feature that this product excels in. On the other hand, the Breville BTA720XL Bit More toaster provides customizable settings as well, but it feels bulkier and less modern. Breville’s ""Lift and Look"" and ""A Bit More"" functionalities are handy but don’t significantly outweigh the convenience of this model’s pre-programmed memory settings. For those who value aesthetics combined with functionality, the PSIIDSAN toaster sits comfortably between these two.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering the advanced features packed into this machine—memory programming, multiple settings, and a touch interface—it delivers excellent performance for its price bracket. Sure, there are cheaper toasters out there. But if you’re into modern appliances and enjoying a more customized toasting experience, the cost feels justified for what this offers. Plus, its combination of aesthetics and performance feels like a bargain compared to premium models that cost significantly more but don’t bring that much on the table.

1ko943t,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaptrail/comments/1ko943t/trip_report_51015/,Trip report - 5/10-15,"Thought I'd share my trip report here in case it's helpful to anyone! I read a lot of reports before setting off but clearly under-researched the final leg....getting my bike on Amtrak.

I drove to Pittsburgh with a one-way rental which I dropped of at noon on Saturday 5.10. Got all my bags together and ready to go, and headed out for a first stop which was a coffee followed by pierogies for lunch. I realized I had forgotten to pack sweatpants and on my way out of town I stopped at the Target in Homestead to buy a pair. I waited out a downpour for a bit but eventually just set off in the rain, and spent the first night at the GAP Trail Campground in West Newton. I was the only one there so I slept in under the overhang and appreciated the LOTR theme. Got dinner and a beer at the brewery, which had a live band.

Day 2 I was planning to meet a friend at Ohiopyle and had reserved a campsite. More heavy rain and we opted to book a room last minute. In the morning we did a rafting outing. There's a boathouse/changing house for rafters with nice clean and hot showers, so post rafting I changed, had lunch and set off for Frostburg where I had a reservation at the Allegheny Trail House. This ended up being a great place to spend the night although the last .25 miles into Frostburg were unwelcome. I did really appreciate the small monument/exhibit describing the lives of miners and their families in Western MD.

Day 3 Frostburg to Hancock with the first 15 miles downhill into Cumberland. At Hancock I spent the night at the Super 8. Room had a microwave which was great for heating up whatever I could scrounge up for food at the Sheetz.

Day 4  -Hancock to Harper's Ferry -  Around Williamsport I diverted to make a visit to Antietam. Aside from about .5 mile of unpleasant road, I welcomed the chance to have a little change of scenery and some nice rolling hills. The battlefield itself is highly bikeable - the main tour is 9.5 miles of quiet roads with rolling hills and informative plaques. I rejoined the canal via Millers Sawmill Road, a bit east of Shepherdstown and continued on to Harper's Ferry. Ended up taking water from a pump - I didn't bring a pump but brought some tabs and the pumps all said you should filter or chemically treat. Night at the TOwn's Inn which was a pretty eclectic spot. They sell all kinds of food you can cook (like eggs, steak, etc), but I went out.

Last day - into DC! I realized at some point that I might be able to make a 4pm train and aimed to make it into DC by 230, and then across town to Union Station by 3. This was a mistake - after waiting in line to change my ticket (I had booked a refundable/changeable fare for Saturday just to keep my options open), it was 330 by the time I made my way down to the platform. The conductor refused to explain anything about what to do with my bike, where the bike racks are, etc. He just kept saying ""theres a bike rack in every car."" And the train was of course packed with people all of whom had big bags and were frantic to find seats.  I finally figured out that the ""bike rack"" is actually the luggage rack, and moved the 20 or so bags that were (quite understandably) stored there, and got the wheel off and the bike hung up, all with a car full of people literally pushing past me to find seats. Shout out to the very kind lady who helped me hold the rack up so I could complete this. So I don't know if there's a better time to arrive, or if I should have just stuck with the 5am train, but I felt like my faux pas ranked somewhere above the dude taking up two seats and eating taco bell and somewhere below the people watching instagram reels with no headphones. Luckily by the time we got to Philly, I had had a chance to change into fresh clothes, buy a half bottle of wine, and none of the same people were on the train car.

I rode my everyday commuter, which is a pretty ancient Surly Crosscheck with 38mm tires. Part of my goal was to convince myself that I can invest in a newer bike for touring, and I think I accomplished that, but I will say that the advantage of my commuter is that I know it fits me really well and it seems like most of the people I met who were struggling were having fit or comfort issues.  Overall it was so fun and if you're a history buff there's lots to love! I will say I brought my camping gear and it was nice to have it because I felt like I could just go every morning without planning - but as you can see I only ended up camping one night.",4,1747422552.0,gaptrail,5,1.0,False
1ko93y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1ko93y6/level_4_300_hours_95_days/,Level 4 - 300 hours - 95 days,"Previous report:

* [Level 1 - 10 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1iqcj0f/10_hour_update_just_the_start/)
* [Level 2 - 50 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1j0gvtn/50_hour_update_onto_level_2/)
* [Level 3 - 150 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1jqr7t7/i_made_it_to_150_hours/)

Hola hola.

Yesterday was a good day as I powered through from 295 hours to 300 hours to get my next bar coloured in on the progress page.

In my last update, I was averaging around 2 hours 45 per day whereas in the past 2 weeks I've been able to average about 4 hours 20mins per day. This is partially because my work has quietened down a little so I have some more downtime where work hasn't spread into the evenings but also, I think, because more interesting content is unlocking that it just feels easier to keep going. 

For DS difficulty, I normally sit around 50-55 where I feel quite comfortable now (this feels crazy to think about where I was at the start of this in Feb!). If I spot an interesting video that is a little more difficult, then I will give it a go but equally I have 182hours of content rated at 55 and below still to watch (gracias for the difficulty filter for making this easy to see!). In reality, I won't watch all of these as some do not interest me but it's nice to know I have a mountain of easier content to come back to during the difficult level 4 phase I keep hearing about.

I'm now getting a lot of input from outside DS purely for the variety and the novelty of being able to browse around YouTube and find interesting content. I'm also utilising podcasts a lot for when I am driving, making a coffee, or have a spare 10 minutes, or doing very boring tasks (some of my higher days are when I have been painting my garden fence!).

Here's a little chart from my spreadsheet tracker to show the split of DS vs non-DS since I started:

https://preview.redd.it/3tkvs0eiz61f1.png?width=1144&format=png&auto=webp&s=0292f78320907b958569fcfc3ec2fd40ea1194b6

**What changes have I noticed?**

This is likely a little more boring than the other levels, nothing really stands out at me particularly. Everything just feels...better. I guess this is just the proof that the process works. Everything is just improving gradually with more input. 

Comprehension has obviously improved. Videos in the 30s and 40s now feel quite slow and I often speed them up.

When I say simple words out loud I'm now realising just how badly I am pronouncing the words compared to how I usually hear them!

**Data points**

* 70% of my DS time has still been watching premium videos. I may watch more non-DS than DS now but I'm almost at 1000 premium videos watched, for a total of $32 so far. That's not a bad deal!!
* In my last update, 25.5 of my hours were outside of DS. This is now 117.5 - so quite a big increase over the last 150 hours.
* Using my daily avg time for the past 2 weeks, my previous update predicted I would hit level 4 on 26th May, so I've come in around 11 days early. The current prediction for level 5 is 24th July, which feels a bit ambitious but if I can still find 4 hours a day then I should be around there.

As the journey to level 7 is long, I promised myself that when I get to level 4 I would buy myself iPad. The day has come, it has been ordered and arrived today. I've already got the essentials loaded up (DS, YouTube, Netflix) to allow me to power through level 4 with some good content without having to take my laptop everywhere!

Thanks again to everyone who posts updates here and encourages others. I read almost all the progress posts and they are really inspiring, no matter what level they are!",10,1747422542.0,dreamingspanish,1,0.92,False

I still can't comprehend I just spent so much $ on a coffee machine. Anyways, Im wondering if you can share some tips with me and I also some random questions.

1. I have legom p64 with mizen omni grinder. My preference is medium roast. I favor sweetness with slight acidity and fruity flavors. Coming from Lelit Bianca I kinda wish the mini had profiling option. Almost purchased Decent but then changed my mind and went for classic. Those made the similar switch, do you find yourself missing the profiling feature? Probably too late to ask this question. 

2. I'm planning to use the water reservoir. Still a bit confused with pre infusion feature when using the tank.

3. Yearly maintenance. The manual says parts replacement annually. Do it apply to home or commercial use? 

4. Loaded question, I have RO filter with remineralization cartridge. The water in my area is soft, 1 grain. TDI is about 10 on the way out. pH is about 7.5-8 Would it be sufficient? 

I'm very excited about the purchase obviously, yet a bit nervous going from profiling machine to flat.

Hopefully they get the recognition they deserve. I feel they are right on the cusp of two stars.

I am a 24F. Recently we had to call out for a guy to come fix our boiler at our place. 

Once he was done he stayed chatting for a bit. One thing he said was that he was really into coffee, imported his own beans from abroad and also had a few cafes he was a regular at. A real coffee aficionado. I currently work in a cafe but am not particularly happy there. I told him about my job but that I was looking for a new one elsewhere. He said he was a regular at this one place and that he would put in a good word for me if I put in an application there. He said they were always looking for new staff. I asked if he knew the owner and he repeated again he was a regular there, they knew all about him and thought he was a great guy. I said why not, I would hand in my resume and that was that. 

I never did in the end because I realised the cafe he was talking about was too far away and too much of a commute (I don’t drive or own a car). 

We had to call the guy back a week later because the boiler still wasn’t working properly. While there he was very annoyed with me and complained that I had made him look bad. He said he’d put himself and his reputation on the line to recommend me for this role, and because I didn’t show up to apply for a job I made him look foolish in front of the staff there.

Here’s a little about me and what I’m looking for—maybe we’ll click :)

About Me:
	•	Age: 27, Female
	•	Location: Maryland (but I spend a lot of time in the DMV)
	•	Look: 5'4"", blonde, fit

I’m an ambitious introvert who enjoys being outdoors—paddle boarding, camping learning to kayak. But rock climbing and line dancing are my absolute favorites. When I’m not adventuring outside, I enjoy spending time with friends and family (some live near me, others I visit on weekends), reading, or having an existential crisis.
I value personal growth and am really into self-help, constantly trying to be a student of life with a witty sense of humor. I’m looking for someone who can have good banter and interesting conversations. Someone self-aware who enjoys life to the fullest and is ready for a genuine connection where we can both grow.
I’m independent but now ready to meet someone to build a real relationship with. If you love the outdoors, and value empathy, fun, and self-growth, let’s connect! I’m easygoing and just hoping to find someone cool to hang out with—maybe grab a coffee or a beer, go for a walk, and see where things go. Happy to swap pics.

1ko8trk,https://i.redd.it/i90ki5g5y61f1.png,The LORE of Italian Brainrot (+ New Character),"After compiling different sources and making things up, I came up with this:

Seven original children were born: Tralalero Tralala, Lirili Larila, Chimpanzini Bananini, Bobrito Bandito, Trulemero Trulicima, Bombardino Crocadilo, and Bombini Gustini. They were experimented on at a young age by cruel human scientists. Each went on in their own way, some helping the world improve and become a better place, while others were driven by vengeance. Now only Tung Tung Tung... Sahur can save the world.

Tung Tung Tung... Sahur is an odd being from the Forestini Forest, a place on the Wooden Planet. Often spelled with two, three, four, five, seven, or ten ""Tung""s.

Little is known about Bobrito Bandito, a top-secret detective working with Tralalero Tralala. Information about him cannot be revealed.

Bombardino Crocadilo was an evil crocodile who bombed the Forestini Forest, the homeland of Tung Tung Tung Sahur, destroying the town and killing Baby Tung, Tung Tung Tung Sahur's son, in the process.

Someone named Patapim found a gold hat, inside of it was a frog named Slim, who said ""brr, brr"". So Patapim met a wizard named Tiramisu and asked how to get rid of Slim. He was told to pop a balloon, and just like that, Slim disappeared.

This wizard had allied with Tralalero Tralala and his team, leading to the powerful being now known as Brr Brr Patapim allying with them.

Ballerina Cappuccina, married to Cappuccino Assassino, is a ballerina with a coffee cup head, who used to be a standard ballerina but drank coffee so much that she turned into a cappuccino. Cappuccino Assassino is a ninja cappuccino with great speed, he wields two katanas. He is a very powerful ninja being. The cappuccinos were married, but Cappuccino Assassino got kidnapped by Espressona Senora, who lied to Cappuccina leading to their divorce. They later remarried.

Tralalero Tralala had his child kidnapped by an evil human scientist named Tim. Tim hired Chimpanzini Bananini to battle, since Tung Tung Tung Sahur killed Bombardino Crocadilo.

Tung Tung Tung Sahur, speaking of which, went to fight Bombardino Crocadilo, and killed him, leading to Bombini Gustini hunting for Tung. He thought he had killed Tung Tung Sahur, but in reality Tung had faked his death, preparing for the larger battle with Chimpanzini Bananini.

Finally, Tralalero Tralala and Tung Tung Tung Sahur teamed up against Bombini Gustini and Chimpanzini Bananini, resulting in an epic battle which led to the Final Boss, the human Tim's last creation before his death. This was a combination of each brainrot character. Through discovery of lore, they returned to their normal state, and Tung Tung Tung... Sahur went on with Tralalero Tralala to save the world.

During all of this, Espressona Senora had been planning to take over the world, and Tung Tung Tung Sahur had finally begun catching on. In the midst of all of this, after the stopping of Chimpanzini Bananini and the slow rise of Espressona Senora, a new, mysterious character would arise. One that no one could anticipate, one that would serve as Espressona Senora's greatest ally, one even more powerful than the final boss, one that Tung Tung Tung... Sahur and Tralalero Tralala could not beat. One more powerful than any other character, one not yet known as an Italian Brainrot character, one more intelligent than any other creature. This is a character no one could have anticipated. No one could have anticipated the rise of Super Aikerini Pastini...",4,1747421838.0,brainrot,3,0.83,False

1ko8r1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/LagreeMethod/comments/1ko8r1y/review_of_lagree_studios_in_7_out_of_10_canadian/,Review of Lagree Studios in 7 out of 10 Canadian Provinces 🇨🇦,"Consistent, 3-4 times a week, Certified Canadian Lagree-er here. Due to my job and having friends/family spread across the country, I’ve been able to try Lagree studios in 7 out of the 10 provinces. For any Canadians here, my sincere (subjective) review of my favourite studio in each city as I wait in the boarding lounge: 

- Lagree YYC in Calgary, Alberta 5/5

Full disclosure: Lagree YYC is my hometown hero, so take this with a grain of local bias. But it’s also where I fell in love Lagree. 

Years later and I’m still impressed by the owner, her team, and the atmosphere she’s cultivated across all three studios. The owner has a relatively high standard for her instructors and she takes a lot of pride in having well-trained and knowledgeable instructors. I think she’s either the only or one of a couple certified master trainers in Canada. Her instructors intimately understand queuing, sequencing, seamless transitions, form etc and that really comes across in every class. 

Are there instructors I vibe with more than others? Yes. But overall YYC has the highest quality instruction I’ve found in Canada. The studios are simple and barebones with no luxe branding or empty pretensions, just emphasis quality and technical instruction. Shoutout to Jacqueline for making sweat feel like a privilege.

- Lagree West in Vancouver, British Columbia 3.5/5

Not my favourite Lagree location, but I totally understand the chokehold it has on the Van girlies. There is a (probably justified) atmosphere of prestige attached to the studio and it falls pretty culty on the spectrum of Lagree studios. While it can seem intimidating and exclusive, if you’re  nonplussed by that energy the instruction is great and the energy is high. 

It is next to impossible to get into a class unless you book the second they open up so fingers crossed they open more locations. I’m dying to try out their Victoria studio!

$43.68 for one class is high key criminal but it is Vancouver so what can you do.  Mendy is my favourite instructor. 

- Studio Lagree (King West) in Toronto, Ontario 4/5

My go to location in Toronto. The instructors know what they’re doing, the music is on point, the vibes are high. 

I don’t mind the dark “Barrys atmosphere” in Lagree classes and they make it work. I always leave feeling refreshed and dialled in. 

I will say I find the classes are more geared to experienced Lagree-ers rather than first timers so if anything they could be more in tune to the needs/abilities of newer Lagree-ers. At this point I’ve taken all the class options and they’ve all been pretty back of the reformer heavy; sometimes I’m like… just gonna take this move off the front.

Otherwise, the front desk staff have been consistently unfriendly (I’ve been like 6-7 times now). Although, as someone who used to live in TO, it’s not really uncommon to find unfriendly characters manning the front desk of a trendy group workout studio. 

- House of Lagree in Edmonton, Alberta 4/5

It’s a nice mix of a trendy atmosphere but still workout focused. I was super excited when they opened last year, it’s been a great addition to the group workout scene in Edmonton. 

I’ve had a couple instructors who’ve struggled with queuing and transitions times, and I later found out they weren’t Lagree Certified but had completed a training in-house at the studio (which there is nothing necessarily wrong with but it can result in knowledge gaps that come across in the instruction). They also confirmed they were given relatively little training before being tossed on the schedule+  it is a new studio so I have more empathy.

It wasn’t nearly as problematic as some instructors I’ve had at other studios in Canada and across the US,  and it won’t stop me from continuing to attend this studio when I can.

- Lagree East in Moncton, New Brunswick 5/5

Full transparency I’ve only taken one class here and haven’t got a chance to really sus it out but that said, I LOVED it. It felt similar to Lagree YYC. At least with the instructor I had there was a noted focus on form, transitions, and tempo. There was a pleasant flow to the class, with good music and pacing. Overall, I was super impressed by the whole experience. 

IMO they’re crushing it, especially given that they only opened this year and is the first Lagree studio in Moncton. The vibes were so friendly and welcoming and honestly it just reenforced my already really positive perception of the Canadian Maritimes. 

And gang… the PRICES were SO reasonable I genuinely gagged on my coffee when I saw what they were offering. I mean I live in the real world and I understand there’s a difference between running a profitable business in Van or TO compared to Moncton but yeeeeeesh. 

I literally floated the idea of moving out there to my BF based solely on the prices listed on their website. I pay close to $150 more per month for the same membership structure in Calgary. 

ALSO I love the name “Lagree East.” It’s a super cute play.

- Lagree Core in Montreal, Quebec 4.5/5

This studio has a “Barrys” vibe which personally I don’t mind. I’ve only taken two classes here and I’ve enjoyed both. 

I chatted a bit with the owner (who has a really fun energy) the last time I was there and it sounds like they have a solid roster of instructors that have been around for years. I thought the instruction was seamless, and there was a definite emphasis on precise form and tempo which I really appreciated. My friends and I really loved the class we took with Ariane and the prices are on par with Calgary/Toronto.

- The Fitual in Winnipeg, Manitoba 2.5/5

To be clear: despite what they call it, this isn’t Lagree. But if you’re not particular about technique and just want a burn, it’ll do. Just don’t expect the finesse of the Lagree method.

It’s a decent reformer workout, but it falls short of authentic Lagree standards. Having taken several classes (my bf is from Winnipeg so we visit a few times a year), I know the instructors do not hold Lagree certification and that lack of education and training is reflected in the queuing, transitions, and sequencing. I think they have one Lagree certified instructor.

The classes generally don’t have any of the precision, flow, and disciplined pacing that define Lagree. I haven’t had a single instructor who puts any emphasis on quick transitions with many of the instructors waiting until the move is over to describe the next move or even demoing the move (and having everyone watch) after the transition.

There’s also a dissonance between the studio’s branding (exclusive, clean girl vibes) and the actual experience (Which feels distinctly… Winnipeg). I think they can do better than a knockoff of what a Toronto or Vancouver or Moncton studio can do authentically. The branding would probably land if it weren’t transparently at odds with the experience so it would be great to see less posturing and more focus on fundamentals.

All that to say, if you’re just looking to sweat it’s satisfactory.",10,1747421645.0,LagreeMethod,3,1.0,False
1ko8qup,https://www.reddit.com/r/FindYourTrip/comments/1ko8qup/luxury_travel_to_the_amalfi_coast_letting_go_of/,Luxury Travel To The Amalfi Coast: Letting Go Of The 'Perfect Trip' Myth,"**Luxury Travel To The Amalfi Coast: Letting Go Of The 'Perfect Trip' Myth**

The Amalfi Coast, with its breathtaking cliffs and charming villages, is the epitome of luxury travel for many. However, the overwhelming desire for a flawless experience often leads to the 'perfect trip' myth. Embracing the true essence of luxury travel to the Amalfi Coast is about letting go of this unrealistic ideal and welcoming spontaneity.

To truly enjoy the Amalfi Coast, immerse yourself in the local culture and its unpredictable nuances. Dine at family-run trattorias, learn a few phrases in Italian, and engage with the warmth of the local residents. Allow serendipity to guide your explorations, from unplanned stops at quaint coastal villages like Ravello or Atrani to lingering at hidden beaches. This approach often leads to the most rewarding and memorable experiences.

Luxury travel to the Amalfi Coast can also be seen through the lens of personalized experiences. Reach out to local artisans for private workshops in ceramics or cooking classes focusing on authentic Neapolitan cuisine. Such unique encounters enable travelers to connect with the region on a deeper level, moving away from the scripted tours and cookie-cutter itineraries that define the 'perfect trip.'

Options for accommodation along the coastline vary from lavish villas with stunning views to boutique hotels that reflect the culture's charm. Consider opting for a spot that encourages relaxation, where the luxury lies in the simplicity of nature rather than extravagance. Imagine enjoying your morning coffee on a terrace overlooking the Mediterranean, breathing in the fresh air and basking in the sunlight.

Ultimately, redefining luxury travel to the Amalfi Coast means embracing the unpredictable beauty of the journey itself. By letting go of the pressure to achieve perfection, you open yourself up to a world of authentic experiences that enrich your understanding of this enchanting destination.

1ko8pfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1ko8pfu/walk_with_me_as_i_argue_this_service_is/,Walk with me as I argue this service is inherently unethical,"DISCLAIMER: This post is not to target anyone or attack anyone. This is my opinion on the service and I just mentioned the few posts that made me start pursuing this line of thinking. 

This is a long one but it has been plaguing me for a whole day. 

This train of thought was sparked by a post I saw on here yesterday about a dasher saying they were waiting to get gas money from their family to complete an order. The OP then posted a screenshot of that message with the title “is this ban worthy?” Besides the insane entitlement in the comment sections of that post. Everyone just made the assumption that the person needing gas money was trying to scam OP. Instead of being humans and assuming this person did need gas money. No one asked OP for gas money btw. 

The post itself and the comments on it got me thinking. Is DoorDash just an inherently unethical service to use? On paper I don’t think it’s that bad of a thing. In practice it is horrible. Now I get just about every method of consumption under capitalism is unethical. HOWEVER, I think DoorDash is perhaps the most unethical. 

To start I think looking at WHO is using DoorDash will be helpful. DoorDash costs significantly more than if you were to just go get that same thing yourself. You’re paying delivery fees, tips and tax. So inherently there is a factor of economic privilege playing into this as you as a consumer have the ability to pay this inflated cost. If you’re using DoorDash you can afford to pay more for something. It’s as simple as that. I don’t really even buy the whole I need DoorDash because I am unable to get food for myself. That’s fair to not be able to get food for yourself. Physical, mental or even material barriers certainly exist when it comes to leaving your house. However, if you cannot get yourself food or groceries there are actual charitable orgs that will deliver hot meals/ groceries etc. DoorDash is not that. It is a luxury service designed to be used by people who can afford the inflated cost. So that’s who is using DoorDash. 

Next is another WHO question. We have to ask WHO is driving for DoorDash? This is a little less clear but I think the most basic assumption of why anyone gets a job can be made. You need money. Why you picked DoorDash as that source of income is somewhat irrelevant at that point. This necessity is where we begin to enter the unethical territory. When analyzing who is using the service vs who is working for the service we can see a link between those with the extra economic means paying those who need the money to do things for them. 

Now we ask WHY is someone willing to pay more for the same thing? Simple. The convenience of it. It sounds great to be able to just click a few buttons and for $20 something extra it just shows up at your house. 

Adding these three things up I think we arrive at an interesting conclusion. Those who have the economic means to use this luxury service are paying people who need money to hand deliver things to them. Those who have are using those who don’t have to do stuff for them. That’s wild (and yes I realize this is essentially every customer service job ever). However, DoorDash starts to stray from the pack when you see all the shit that you can now DoorDash. I saw another post on here TODAY showing an order of like 12 or so 50lbs bags on concrete. What the fuck? Having someone who isn’t yourself or a construction company lug around 1200+ pounds of shit because you don’t want to get it yourself and you can pay for it is just insane. The dasher is then responsible for loading that shit up and carrying it to you or they get docked for not taking an order etc. Just essentially forcing someone in a position of necessity to lug that shit around for you or face the consequence of losing employment and this the money they need to live. Haul my half ton of concrete or get fired errand boy! 

Overall this disparity is everywhere in the service industry but I think DoorDash shows this very clearly. Being able to pay someone to do something doesn’t make you entitled to that thing. You don’t have a right to just place ridiculous orders or berate someone for taking too long to bring you your coffee because they don’t have enough money to get gas just because your wallet is big enough. Have some fucking patience. Have a heart. Most importantly, have some personal accountability to get your own shit. 

Sorry if this makes you feel bad about your consumption but in my eyes this is just the nature of using this service. 

As this is Reddit I don’t expect this to be engaged with in good faith but I am eager to hear the other side. Why is DoorDash good? Why is it ethical? Are we entitled to that convenience? Is it okay to make someone pickup and then haul a half ton of concrete for you? ",4,1747421530.0,doordash,19,0.61,False

Sobrang limited lang yung slots — **50 applicants only**, tapos kailangan **pre-registered via form**, **no walk-ins allowed**. Mas okay pa kung may referral ka from an employee dahil may sponsorship eme sila.

Dumating ako sa venue **past 10am**, and buti nalang pasok pa kasi **cutoff is 12 noon**. Pagdating ko, madami-daming tao pero konti lang yung screeners — around **3 to 4 lang vs 50 applicants**, so medyo mabagal talaga yung process.

Pero **bawi sa freebies**! May **free snacks, coffee**, tapos **lunch pa — Jollibee Chicken Joy with Peach Mango Pie** pa yung sa amin. Not bad diba?

Sa screening, na-interview ako ng TA, then **na-endorse agad ako sa Ops for CSR (voice)**. Yung interview with the hiring manager was surprisingly **magaan** pero **mahaba — more than an hour** yung session namin.

All those years, I exclusively focused on espresso. Recently, I wanted to expand the horizon and got a Hario V60 and Stagg to step into pour overs. My grinder is Niche Zero and it makes *great* espresso. But my pour overs have been one disappointment after another. I've gone through sooo much beans trying to dial it in before I wave the white flag, but I've been unable to get it to taste better than Dunkin's. I've referenced various videos on YT from Hoffman's method to Lance Hendrick's to many others. I just can't seem to find anything that works.

I have read that Niche Zero isn't the best for pour overs because the grinds are too fine, but I didn't know it was *this* bad. I've tried grind settings from as low as 35 all the way to 50. No matter the setting, it tastes flavorless and downright bitter. Pains me to write this because I take great pride in my coffees!

1ko8jjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBeautyCircle/comments/1ko8jjp/buxom_full_on_glossy_lip_oil/,Buxom Full On Glossy Lip Oil,"So I've been on a bit of a lip product journey lately. You know how it goes – you try one thing, then another, and suddenly your makeup drawer is overflowing with half-used glosses and balms. But I gotta tell you about my latest obsession that's actually stuck around longer than a week: the Buxom Full On Glossy Lip Oil.

# What Makes Buxom Lip Oil Different?

I remember the first time I tried this lip oil. I was actually shopping for something else entirely (isn't that always how it goes?) when the display caught my eye. After years of working with beauty products and testing literally hundreds of lip formulas, I've become pretty picky. But this one... this one surprised me.

The Buxom Full On Glossy Lip Oil isn't your typical sticky gloss or drying stain. It's this perfect hybrid that gives you shine without the tacky feeling that has your hair constantly sticking to your lips on windy days. We've all been there, right?

# The Feel on Your Lips

Let me just say – the texture is what truly sets this apart. It glides on smooth like, well, oil (duh), but it doesn't feel greasy or heavy. The first time I applied it, I kept rubbing my lips together because it felt so darn comfortable. It's got this lightweight cushiony feel that somehow manages to stay put longer than most glosses I've tried.

And can we talk about the slight tingling sensation? It's not overwhelming like some plumping products that make you feel like your lips are on fire. It's just enough to give you that ""something's happening"" feeling. Some of my clients describe it as refreshing, especially in the summer months.

# The Color Range Is Actually Impressive

Now, being someone who tests products professionally, I've seen a lot of disappointing color ranges. But Buxom really delivered with these lip oils. They have everything from barely-there nudes to some pretty bold pinks and reds.

My personal fave is ""Sweet Talker"" – it's this perfect everyday pink that somehow manages to work with literally every makeup look I try. I wore it to a wedding last month and got so many compliments... and it survived through dinner and speeches! That's saying something.

# How I Incorporate It Into My Routine

So here's the thing – I'm not someone who spends hours on makeup anymore. In my 20s? Sure. Now? I need products that multitask and don't require a steady hand or perfect lighting to apply.

I've found that the Buxom lip oil is perfect for:

# Everyday Wear

Most mornings, I'm rushing to get ready while simultaneously making coffee and checking emails (bad habit, I know). This lip oil is perfect for quick application without a mirror. I can swipe it on while running out the door, and it looks intentional rather than messy.

I've even started keeping one in my car for touch-ups, which has saved me on more than one video call where I realized I looked completely washed out.

# Special Occasion Enhancement

But don't think this is just a casual product! For events or nights out, I actually love layering this over a lip liner for added dimension. The glossy finish catches the light in photos without that weird flashback some other glosses give.

Last week I used it over a neutral liner for a client presentation, and it stayed put through two hours of talking. That's pretty impressive for something so comfortable to wear.

# Honest Thoughts: The Good and The Could-Be-Better

Look, no product is perfect, and I wouldn't be giving you my real opinion if I didn't mention both sides. Here's what I truly think after using Buxom lip oils for the past several months:

# What I Love

The hydration is no joke. My lips actually feel better after wearing this all day, which is rare for anything with color. The shine factor is also perfect – it's noticeable without looking like you're trying to relive 2002.

And can we talk about the applicator? The slightly angled doe-foot makes it so easy to apply precisely without going outside your lip line. As someone who's definitely applied lipstick while in a moving vehicle (don't be like me), I appreciate this more than you know.

[Check out the Buxom Full On Glossy Lip Oil here](https://amzn.to/44GVpe5)

# What Could Be Better

If I'm being totally honest, I do wish they lasted a tiny bit longer. While they outperform most glosses, you'll still need to reapply after eating or drinking. I've found that blotting lightly after application helps with longevity.

And — this is just personal preference — but I wish the packaging was a bit more distinctive. I have too many lip products that look similar in my bag, and I'm constantly pulling out the wrong one!

# How to Choose the Right Shade For You

Picking colors online can be tricky... I've definitely ordered what I thought was a ""subtle nude"" only to receive something that made me look like I was auditioning for a zombie movie. So here's my advice after trying most of the Buxom range:

# For Fair to Light Skin Tones

If you're on the fairer side like me, the shades ""Dolly Danger"" and ""White Russian"" are gorgeous everyday options. They give you that ""your lips but better"" look without washing you out.

# For Medium Skin Tones

Medium skin tones look amazing with ""Havana"" or ""Sugar"" – they enhance your natural color while adding the perfect amount of warmth.

# For Deep Skin Tones

Deeper skin tones are beautifully complemented by ""Cherry Flip"" or ""Berry Blast"" which provide rich, dimensional color that really pops.

# The Final Verdict

After incorporating the Buxom Full On Glossy Lip Oil into my daily routine and recommending it to clients with various preferences and needs, I gotta say – it's earned its permanent spot in my makeup bag (and that's saying a lot, since I'm constantly cycling products in and out for testing).

For around $20, it's not the cheapest option out there, but it's not luxury-priced either. And considering how little you need per application, one tube lasts surprisingly long.

So if you're looking for something that bridges the gap between treatment and makeup – something you can quickly apply that both looks good AND feels good – this is definitely worth trying.

Whether you're a makeup minimalist or someone who enjoys a full glam look, I think you'll find the Buxom Full On Glossy Lip Oil to be a versatile addition to your collection. And hey, if you try it, let me know what you think! I'm always curious to hear if my recommendations work out for others.

1ko8jg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/visitingnyc/comments/1ko8jg4/trip_review/,Trip Review,"My wife and I recently spent a week in NYC and I wanted to share my honest review on our hotel, attractions we visited, and food we ate to help anyone considering a similar trip.

**Hotel** - We stayed at The Beekman in the Financial District.  We used Hyatt points to book our hotel, so it was essentially free for us.  Quality of the hotel and staff was top notch.  Everyone was helpful and friendly, housekeeping offered turn down service each night and brought bottled water and sleep chocolates each afternoon, plus fresh towels.  Coffee in the lobby every morning was hot and accompanied by options for milk, half and half, and almond milk.  Location of the hotel was great as well, easy access to ferry at Battery Park for Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, as well as a quick walk to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum and the Fulton Street and Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall subway stations.


**Subway** Easy to use, just scanned our credit card from phone at the turnstile and went in.  Used Google Maps app to find which train to take.  The only problems we ran into were after a show one night, our train was delayed for an undetermined amount of time due to an investigation, so we decided to Uber back to the hotel for about $65.  The other time we had trouble finding where the platform for the J train at the Fulton Street station because there are multiple levels at this station.  Otherwise, affordable and we always felt safe.


**Day 1**

**Joe's Pizza** Tried the white, fresh mozzarella, and pepperoni slices.  All were very good and affordable.  The crust was crispy on the bottom and they warmed up the slices in the oven before serving.  Favorite was probably the white.  Very limited seating options so we stood outside at a table. 

**The Dead Rabbit** Crowded on a Saturday night as would be expected.  It was very hot inside due to the amount of people, but I got a Guinness and my wife ordered the Twilight Zone cocktail (Irish whiskey, Guinness, amaro, raspberry, lemon).  Tasty drinks, but also $20 for a cocktail, which is unfortunately the norm for a big city.  Atmosphere was very lively and fun, would recommend making a reservation for a table on a busy weekend night.


**Day 2**

**Bubby's** Probably the best breakfast we ate all week.  We tried the pancake flight and the biscuits and hatch chili sausage gravy.  Pancakes were just the right amount of sweet and had a perfect fluffy texture.  Hatch chili gravy was a touch spicy, but not overdone.  Would recommend getting there early, as a line was starting to form by the time they opened.

**Met Cloisters** Such an underrated experience and beautiful grounds.  Lots of Christian religious artifacts and the architecture in the abbey style was amazing.  We took the subway to the Dyckman station and walked up the rest of the way up through the park, about 10-15 minutes.

**Yankees game** We bought tickets in section 320A which gave us a great view and access to the Jim Beam lounge, which has a separate bar, food vendors, and bathrooms, as well as free peanuts and popcorn.  However, it was still packed, probably due to the rain delay.  If we went again, I would consider sitting somewhere else to try out different food options.  We stayed for the whole game, which turned out to be close, but the Yankees weren't able to complete the comeback.

**John's of Bleecker Street** Took the subway back and stood in line for 20 minutes to get into John's.  In comparison with Joe's, John's sauce is better, and they have a wood fired crust in a brick oven, which gives it a better char.  Both pizzas were excellent, but I have to give the nod to John's.

**Blind Tiger** Grabbed a quick drink across the street.  College vibe with a couple TVs playing NBA playoffs.  Good beer list featuring mostly local or northeast beers.


**Day 3**

**Leo's Bagels** Walked here and grabbed an enormous bagel breakfast sandwich.  Delicious, but if I went back, we would share one instead.  Texture of the bagel was great, better than anything I've had at home.

**Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island** We did the pedestal tour as opposed to the crown reserve and it was plenty.  Lots of stairs, so be prepared to climb or take breaks.  It was a rainy/overcast day, so views were limited, but neat to see and hear about the history of the statue.  Ellis Island was really cool for me as I have family that actually came through and I found their names on the Wall of Honor.  If you're into history, definitely check these out.  Ferry was also a quick ride to each location.

**Fraunces Tavern** We made a lunch reservation here and shared a pulled pork flatbread and the sticky toffee pudding.  Flatbread was good, just messy, but the sticky toffee pudding was excellent and I want it again now.

**9/11 Memorial & Museum** Extremely emotional.  Seeing artifacts from the wreckage, hearing stories of victims and survivors.  Be prepared to cry.

**Los Tacos No. 1** I ordered the carne asada and pollo asado tacos and my wife got the adobada tostada, plus we shared some chips and guacamole at the counter and ate at a standing table inside.  Meat was marinated well and guacamole tasted super fresh.  Not bad prices either.

**Bar Room at The Beekman** We got a drink here to end our night.  I got the Benito Antonio (chili-infused tequila, cilantro syrup, lime) and my wife got the Pablo Neruda (tequila, mezcal, vermouth, pomegranate, habanero, lime).  Mine had a distinct cilantro flavor, so if you're not into that, beware.  Hers was very good, a touch sweet.  Expensive as expected by a cocktail bar, but worth it for the atmosphere.


**Day 4**

**Waverly Diner** Checked this out after reading a good review online somewhere.  I got an omelet and my wife got the corned beef hash and eggs.  I didn't think this was anything special and really could've gotten the same thing anywhere.  If anything, it's probably a nostalgic location for some people.

**Top of the Rock** Arrived at our scheduled time and they recommended rescheduling due to low visibility from pouring rain, so we came back the next day and did some souvenir shopping for family instead.

**Hamburger America** Solid smash burger.  Double patties, cheese, and grilled in onions gave it a nice flavor.  Fries were fine, but nothing special.

**Wicked on Broadway** We sat in the orchestra section close to the front and I'm glad we did.  This show is a fricking spectacle.  The set, costumes, choreography, and level of talent from the actors is just astonishing.  Wowed at all levels.


**Day 5**

**American Museum of Natural History** Arrived a little before they opened so wandered through Central Park.  Museum is massive and it would take a long time to see everything.  Highlights were the dinosaur bones, giant sequoias, and the blue whale.

**Magnolia Bakery** Tried the banana pudding and damn, that is good.

**Top of the Rock** Round two for this, went inside and through a backdoor entrance, which kinda let us skip the line forming outside.  Even with that, once inside, we waited about 45 minutes for an elevator.  Schedule accordingly.  Views from the top are great, you can see Empire State Building, Central Park, all of the highlights.  Great central location.

**Yellow Rose** Went here for lunch after reading about their great Texas-style queso, which was indeed delicious and authentic.  Also got some margaritas and a variety of tacos.  Quality of tortillas was great, but the tacos may have been a touch over-filled with ingredients causing the tortilla to fall apart a bit.

**McSorely’s Old Ale House** I read about the history of this place online and wanted to check it out.  I knew going in that options for beer are “dark” or “light” and it is served warm.  Even so, I felt very out of place as a tourist.  The one guy serving drinks seemed annoyed to deal with anyone other than what must be his regular customers.  Paid cash and tipped well, but I probably wouldn’t go back.

**The Up & Up** We made a reservation to have a drink here before a comedy show.  Neat speakeasy style place tucked away downstairs.  My wife tried the As Much As A Duck (mezcal, scotch, amaro, lemon/lime, cayenne, and egg white) and I got a dry vodka martini.  Hers was unique, just a touch of spice with the cayenne and mine was very well made.

**7th Street Burger** We went almost next door for a quick burger.  This was right on par with Hamburger America, minus the onions.  Lots of flavor and also had a great sauce on the burger.  Between the two, I’d vote for 7th Street.

**Comedy Cellar** Made reservations a few weeks before and got seats right up front.  I think there were 6 comics, all fairly good, some better than others.  Seating is a bit tight, but we had a great time.


**Day 6**

**Electric Lemon** A friend gave us a recommendation to check this place out for breakfast inside the Equinox Hotel.  It was filled with guys dressed in suits and probably grabbing a quick bite before work, so probably not our scene.  We shared some avocado toast and the fingerling potatoes.  Avocado toast was alright, but the potatoes were cooked perfect and served with a pimento aioli that we loved.

**The Vessel** Went up right when they opened at 10:00 a.m.  The climb is not as much as it appears and the views from the top are pretty cool.

**High Line** Took a walk on here from Hudson Yards down to Chelsea Market, about a mile.  Really pretty gardens on either side and just a nice relaxing walk.

**Chelsea Market** Did a little souvenir shopping in here.  Quite crowded and catered to selling you anything and everything.

**Pier 57** Went inside here and grabbed a beer at Harlem Hops.  Beer was great and bartender was a real nice guy.

**Little Island** Nice park and amphitheater on the island, along with a snack shack, not sure what they were serving.

**Grand Banks** Might have been my food and drink highlight of the trip.  This is an old historic wooden schooner docked at Pier 25.  Ordered some champagne oysters which were probably the best I’ve ever had.  Also got a burrata salad and some fries, plus our awesome server sold us on a key lime mousse with blueberries and graham cracker crumble.  Great music and service added to an amazing experience.  If there is one place you eat and drink, make it here.

**& Juliet** Sat in the front row of the upper mezzanine, so still a great view.  This was a sing-along performance featuring Joey Fatone from NSYNC and we had a blast.  In comparison with Wicked, I feel like this is directed toward a younger crowd and features pop music from the 90s/2000s with a bunch of humorous moments.  Favorite characters were Angelique (Juliet's nurse) and Anne Hathaway.  Again, choreography and vocals are so impressive.


**Day 7**

**Utopia Bagels** My wife got one of their rainbow bagels and I tried a bagel sandwich again with avocado and hash brown.  Taste and texture of the bagel was pretty comparable to Leo’s.  I would probably choose Utopia based on the more manageable size.

**The Met** Had to wait in pouring rain for about 20 minutes to get inside, luckily we did have one umbrella and rain jackets.  Again, absolutely huge museum, but our favorites were the rooms decorated in the period of the furniture from that era, plus some pieces by Van Gogh, Monet, and Georgia O’Keefe.

**Central Park** Took a stroll through here and saw the Bethesda Fountain and Terrace, Strawberry Fields, and Alice in Wonderland statue.  Also grabbed a quick bite (chicken salad and roast beef sandwiches) from the Café at the Boathouse.  Food was okay, views were very pretty.

**Levain Bakery** Dropped in here and tried these viral cookies.  I’m sure there are better ones out there, but as 
a tourist, pretty damn good.

**Paesano’s of Mulberry Street** Made a reservation here for our last night.  Empty when we first got there, but packed by the time we were leaving.  I got the lasagna and my wife had pesto gnocchi.  Excellent sauce on both and mine just melted together so much leaving a delicious pile of pasta.  Neat to see Little Italy lit up at night.

**Laissez Faire** Neat little club in the basement of our hotel.  I’m sure the vibe picks up to a much younger crowd in the later hours, but we called it a night at about 10:30 p.m.  


**Day 8**

**Brooklyn Bridge** Walked across the bridge both ways.  Impressive architecture with pretty views of the city.

**Katz’s Delicatessen** Already crowded upon entering around 11:00 a.m. Made sure to tip our meat cutter and he gave us a sample.  Shared a pastrami on rye and some potato latkes.

1ko8hq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ko8hq2/best_way_to_ask_out_a_service_employee/,best way to ask out a service employee,"i work at a coffee shop and when i was counting the tips there was a note crumbled up in a 5 dollar bill. the note complimented me, said her name and number, and the drink she ordered. i remember this person since we had a good chat before and she ordered a seasonal beverage.

i don’t get asked out too often at work but it can be pretty awkward getting asked for my number… its rude to say no and i also don’t want to embarrass anyone.

anyway, leaving a note (bonus points with a tip) is the way to ask out an employee. i blushed for about 30 minutes after reading the note, just because of how thoughtful, cool, and non awkward the situation was. the girl who asked me out was also a barista so i’m sure she had her fair share of getting asked out while working.

this post isn’t to discourage anyone from asking out service workers or make anyone feel bad if they have asked service workers out. just a piece of advice for anyone unsure of how to ask a service worker out. also this is coming from someone who is a bit awkward and anxious in socially so what i’m saying may not be true for all!

I left for GameStop around 9:30 PM after work and was kicked out by 11:30—mall security wasn’t having it. I ended up posted at Denny’s drinking coffee, did a couple walk-throughs, and by 2:30 AM I noticed three people already lined up outside the mall doors. At 5:45 AM, they finally opened—but we quickly realized six other people had already been let in through the back. We weren’t first. Not even close.

GameStop’s allocation of the Prismatic ? Just seven boxes. With a two-per-customer limit, the fourth person in line was the cutoff. That’s it. Done.

So I headed to Target next, got there early, landed at number 15 in line—only to find out they had exactly 14 boxes in stock. And they didn’t even tell us the quantity ahead of time. Missed it by one. That moment stung.

After that, I hit several local game stores. Most were dry or charging well over MSRP. On what I had decided would be my final stop before giving up, I got lucky. One shop had it—listed at $275—but thanks to in-store credit I’d saved up forever, I got it down to just under $140.

Nearly 36 hours. One product. Almost walked away with nothing. That’s f***in' wild to me.

The current state of the Pokémon TCG is honestly a mess. What used to be a community-driven hobby now feels like a scalper-run system that rewards bots, resellers, and people who know someone behind the counter.

Trying to get something like the Prismatic Evolutions Premium Ultra Collection shouldn’t feel like prepping for a military operation. And for what? So someone can flip it on eBay for 3x the price before a single kid even opens a pack?

Retailers are barely getting stock. Target enforces a one-per-person limit. GameStop gets seven boxes total. And meanwhile, The Pokémon Company keeps pushing out new sets and premium drops like the hype is sustainable—without addressing the clearly broken distribution pipeline.

Black bolt etb was a step in the right direction—but one product isn’t enough.

This isn’t about collectors anymore. This is about access. The average player. The kid just getting into the game. The lifelong fan trying to reconnect. We’re getting pushed out—and somehow, this level of chaos is becoming “normal.”

But it’s not normal. It’s not normal to wait a day and a half for a box of cards. It’s not normal to feel relieved that you paid MSRP. And it’s definitely not okay that a hobby built by passion is being stripped down by profit margins and artificial scarcity.

Until pokemon enacts real reforms—print-to-demand windows, proper online queue systems, consistent local allocations—this is just going to keep spiraling.

And the saddest part? The community built this hobby. We made Pokémon what it is. And now, we’re the ones being left outside, watching it get resold to the highest bidder.

Now that involved me taking a train for 20 minutes to get to the next town over, after the date was finished we walked to the train station and waved at each other as the train left, both of us content that the date went off without a hitch.

After a few minutes, she called via a vid call on WhatsApp and we spent a few moments (about four minutes at the very most) talking to each other about how nice the day was and that we'd like to arrange another date for next week.

At the start of the call, I overheard a fellow passenger who I assume was around late 40s, early 50's mention to his companion that, ""That's not needed at all"", while gesturing in my direction, I ignored his comment and finished off my vid call.

When I was arriving at the station, one stop away from my destination, this ""gentleman"" stood up and walked to the train doors, and as he walked past he knelt down by my seat several inches away from my face and went on a small non shouting tirade about, ""That was unnecessary, it's a phone, you put it to your ear, I can tell your not a full shilling"".

I stood up and shouted in his face telling him to ""F*ck off and ignore it then, and what gives you the right to go up to someone you don't know and start speaking to them like a c*nt"".

The man was obviously taken back by my outburst, and said he was going to report me to the station attendant and made a brisk exit while looking around for a station worker.

The ticket inspector onboard overheard the outburst and came over to ask what had happened and I explained in brief what had transpired and he said he'd make a note of it.

 I don't know if this is the right place to post this...but well here I go. After ages, I finally had a free day and visited the National Museum in Delhi for the first time. I'd always envisioned it as a grand window into India's incredible civilization, and while I was excited, the experience left me feeling a bit let down. Many displays were closed, the lighting was poor, and the immersive exhibits weren't even functioning. While i could understand the closed displays since it was a weekday and probably expected to be a low traffic day;  the museum shop was the biggest disappointment. It was more of a cramped storage space with expensive coffee table books and old exhibition catalogs. Having seen inspiring museum shops elsewhere, and even appreciating the ASI book shop at Qutub Minar, I had hoped for maybe just a little more from our national museum. I was hoping to find unique paperbacks and cheap books on Indian history, perhaps by obscure ASI scholars on places like Ajanta or the Indus Valley, or even small, meaningful souvenirs that reflected our heritage, like a Pashupati seal replica or the Ashok chakra or something like that. I genuinely wanted to support it, but there wasn't much beyond pricey coffee books and some random showpieces. It makes you wonder if we shouldn't expect more from what is essentially meant to be a key showcase of India's rich past. Am I expecting too much when I think that  our national museum should better reflect the depth and uniqueness of our civilization? I mean delhi is the window to india for many foreign nationals and Indians from different states. So shouldn't our museums be better managed? I don't know..maybe I'm just over reacting and expected too much but just wanted to share my opinions.

On a positive note, the tea in the museum shop was surprisingly good, though!


TLDR: National Museum in Delhi visit was disappointing. Many things closed/not working, and the museum shop was bad (expensive books, no cool souvenirs).

The old Philmore crystal set didn’t work any more, and Mike wouldn’t turn it on if it did. All you got now was that rock-roll music, or some blowhards with more opinions than sense. Worse than that Father Coughlin, some of ‘em.

Great-grandchild set it up. Becca, a real whizbang at that sort of thing. Right inside the radio there was a tiny little doohickey, where you just pressed the button and it played through the old speaker, crackles and static and all, as God intended.

*Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!*

The eerie music played, and Mike settled in beside Ellie on the porch seat. They’d had a swing for a long while, till they found out neither of them liked it much and were just tolerating it for the other’n’s sake. A good, solid, cushioned bench suited both of them better.

They were both under blankets against the slight evening chill. Their latest cat, George, was stretched out over Ellie’s lap, resting up from his hard day of napping.

“You can hear OK, Ellie?”

She nodded. “Fine, fine. Or I could, if you’d hush up.”

Mike made to swat her with his cane, and she giggled. Mother had warned him against Ellie and her smart mouth, but had he listened?

They both followed along on the latest adventures of that unseen hero, Lamont Cranston, as he foiled another dastardly plot. They even left in the commercials. “…*so protect your family’s health by burning Blue Coal, America’s finest anthracite!*”

Ellie leaned in and snuggled up, putting her hand on his chest.

“Why, Elanor Jean, what are you up to? I am an innocent boy of just a hundred and two, you know.”

“Well, I guess I’m just a bad influence.”

“Mother always said so.”

Ellie turned closer to him. This slightly disturbed George, but he just purred louder and nearly fell off.

“It’s that dandy green laprobe you got on, Mike. Drives me wild.”

Mike near bounced her head off his chest, laughing.

The orchestra played *Love In Bloom*, and Jack Benny thankfully didn’t try to join in on his creaky violin.

“*LSMFT! LSMFT! Lucky Strike means fine tobacco!*” Mike hadn’t had one since ‘45, when he shipped home from the Army. So long ago, yet so close.

Some unwelcome memories floated in, and Mike pulled Ellie closer.

“Mike… you always do that when the Lucky Strike man comes on. Why is that?”

He had protected her from such gruesome reality for eighty years and wasn’t about to stop now. “Don’t rightly know, Ellie. Maybe I’m just glad you got me to quit.”

Her frail spotted hand was bent with pain he could not spare her. She moved it again across his chest. It was an old, old signal.

“Now Ellie, I don’t know if I can… I mean, it’s been…”

“Oh, hush yourself. Just sit there and be my man. I ain’t trying to seduce you.”

Mike chuckled. “Well all right, you foul temptress, long as you ain’t expecting any miracles.”

“This is a miracle, Mike. It’s all the miracle I ever wanted.”

The sun was setting on their piece of land, their dream. Mike took a slug of his coffee. Most of their kids had gone off to the city, one of them clear to another country, chasing their own dreams. Gertie had stayed on to work the farm. Unexpected, but she was better at it than he’d ever been. Even she was what, seventy-five now?

“*It’s the Bob Hope Pepsodent Variety Hour, starring*…”

Mike reached over and turned the volume down a little. Ellie was dozing, George was lost in some whisker-twitching dream, and the sun was a flattened red blob on the edge of darkness.

*How many more days like this?* he wondered. He felt foolish and selfish even asking. How many miracles could one man expect?

He looked down on the wispy white hair and fragile hand of his Ellie, and fought back tears. *For her sake, Lord. For her sake, just a few more miracles.*",1,1747420635.0,DivaythStories,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 10 years and living together for 5. A couple of months ago, I started suspecting he might be cheating on me. He had started taking unusually long walks with our dog what used to be 45 minutes turned into 2 hours. At the time I was struggling with issues at work and would get sad about it randomly and something about his behavior just didn’t feel right.

When I asked him about the long walks, he said he was just listening to podcasts and losing track of time. I tried to believe him, but my gut kept telling me something was off.

One Monday eventing he went out again for another long walk. around an hour and a half. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I waited outside. When he came back up the stairs, (outside) he was on the phone with someone and looked visibly startled when he saw me. He instantly hung up and asked what I was doing there. I asked who he was talking to, and he claimed it was a family member.

Something felt off, so for the first time ever, I asked to see his phone. It turned out he was on the phone with a new colleague from work. They had been talking for an hour. I started freaking out — I mean, who wouldn’t? He talks to male and female colleagues all the time while I'm around, and I’ve never had a problem with it. But this just felt different.

He said she had trouble with one of the work programs and needed help. I tried to act normal, even though I was still suspicious. I asked to see their WhatsApp messages, and that’s when he exploded — he said I was a control freak and crazy for even asking. I broke down in tears. He was pushing me away, telling me to go elsewhere. But when I started packing to leave, he suddenly changed his tune and came to show me the messages.

There were none.

He said I was losing my mind over one phone call and that I needed therapy for jealousy something I never really struggled with before. I left and went to my parents’ house. When I explained what happened, even my mom thought I was overreacting. I asked him (while I was still away) to message her casually just to say “how’s everything going” to see how she would respond. He did, and she replied in a professional, friendly way. He told me she had been going through a hard time at work and in her personal life (she has a husband and two kids).

So I went back. I apologized, thinking maybe I *was* the problem, and started working on myself. I made him coffee, packed his lunch, and we started planning to plant flowers in the garden. I was trying really trying to fix things Since i had been so sad because of work.

Then one day, I had a gut feeling again and checked his phone. I found messages under a random contact name. Things like “honey,” “I love you,” and “you truly shine.” Keep in mind: this is someone he had only known for two weeks. I broke down crying in the car.

When he asked what was wrong, I told him I saw the messages. Instead of taking me home, we went to his parents house. I told them he cheated on me, and instead of listening to me, they told me to calm down and talk it through. His mom said he “would never do something like that after 10 years,” even while I showed her the messages.

He hit me with the classic: “It’s not what it looks like.” I called my mom to come get me.

I stayed at my parents’ for a week, but I eventually went back. I didn’t have a place to sleep at that time no job so no income. I We took a long walk of 3 hours to talk it through.

He admitted he sent the messages but insisted “nothing happened.” He said he never kissed her, never touched her. He had no real explanation for why he called her “honey” or said “I love you.”

It’s been two months since then. I try to act normal, but every day it eats at me. I think about it constantly on my way to my new job (which is great), when he says he’s going out. My minds thinking he’s doing it all over again. I think about the moment he gaslit me, called me crazy and a control freak, when I was right all along. I even started to believe it myself.

Even my own family didn’t believe me at first. They said I was just looking for trouble...

The long time i had been ""down"" i almost understood why he did it but he still says that before that nothing happend and the messages were sent  when I had been trying so hard to be the “perfect girlfriend"" after i believed myself to be crazy.

I can't talk to anyone about this. My bf asked to not bring it up anymore, my parents will just ignore it and i dont really have any close friends.. My life now is going good. I just sometimes think about moving out closer to my work while he isn't suspecting a thing because i feel like i can't ever trust him anymore but i just don't wanna be the person that leaves randomly now..

  
edit: I didn't write this but when he sent the message that i asked when i was goneon ""how things were going"" to her, turns out he made a secondary whatsapp account to reply to his own message and he made me aswel as my mom believe it was actually her writing that.

My chest tightened. I tapped our chat. Nothing. No heart. No “seen.” No anything. Just a name—Michiko.

That was the second glitch.

Michiko was a friend from high school. In this world, somehow… she was my girlfriend. My timeline had been rewritten. I didn’t know how, but I knew it wasn’t right. Kim was supposed to be here.

Something had shifted—somehow, the past had been edited. Kim had moved to Nueva Ecija before we could even meet. Which made no sense. Which hurt.

I felt like I was the only one who remembered the original timeline.

So I texted her anyway.
MyDay: “BABY WHERE ARE YOU?”
She replied: “huh?”
Like I was a stranger.

I panicked. I told her everything. That she was mine. That something changed the past. That I remembered. She didn’t believe me—how could she? It sounded insane.

But I wasn’t giving up.

I met up with Michiko at a coffee shop near the plaza. She smiled like everything was normal. Like I hadn’t just woken up in someone else’s life.

“Hey babe,” she said, reaching for my hand.

I flinched.
“Michiko… we need to talk.”

Her smile faded, replaced by the concerned look of someone who thinks their partner is about to say something unforgivable.

“You’re not my girlfriend,” I said, the words tasting like betrayal. “At least… you’re not supposed to be.”

She blinked. “What are you talking about?”

“There’s someone else. Kim. I don’t know what’s going on, but everything’s wrong. I think—someone changed the past. I think I’m stuck in the wrong timeline.”

She stared at me in silence, then gave a dry laugh. “You’re joking, right?”

I shook my head. “I remember her. Everything. The messages, the moments, the late-night calls. We were together. We’re supposed to be together.”

“You sound crazy.”

“I probably am.”

But I didn’t care. I had to find Kim.

I couldn’t stop myself. I went back to Messenger. Kim had read my message.

She replied:
“Are you okay?”

Not “Baby.” Not “I miss you too.” Just confusion. Like she barely knew me.

But I knew her. Her laugh, her voice, the way she curled into my chest when we slept. I remembered our love like it was printed into my bones.

So I told her everything—how in my world, we were already together. How I woke up and suddenly, she was gone.

“I think I’m stuck in a dream,” I typed.
“But it feels like I’m the only one who knows what’s real.”

She left me on read. I couldn’t blame her.

I don’t know why I ended up at the mall, but I felt drawn to it—like something was calling me back. I passed by people laughing, eating, scrolling on their phones, living their lives like nothing was off.

But mine was. Badly.

I entered a science exhibit on the second floor. It was showing displays about parallel universes, quantum memory, altered timelines. I laughed bitterly—how convenient.

And then…

There she was.

Kim.

Walking past the spinning atom model. Holding a drink. Laughing with friends.

My legs moved before I could think. I ran up to her. I didn’t care how weird I looked. I didn’t care if I was crazy.

I pulled her into a hug—tight, desperate, like I could anchor myself to reality just by holding her.

And then—

I gasped.

My room.

My ceiling.

My phone vibrating beside me.

I was back.

Tears ran down my face before I could stop them. My heart ached like I’d just been yanked out of a story I didn’t finish reading.

I called her—Kim. My real Kim.

She answered groggily. “Hey… what’s wrong?”

“I had the craziest dream,” I said, trying to catch my breath. “You weren’t mine anymore. Someone else was. The world changed and I was the only one who remembered.”

Silence on the line. Then she whispered, “But I’m yours now.”

“I know,” I whispered back. “I just needed to hear it.”

We stayed on the call until we both fell asleep again. Her breathing steadied my heart.

Sometimes I still think about that dream. About the version of me still out there, confused, holding on to a love he never got to keep.

I don’t know why I got to wake up and he didn’t.

But I do know this:
Reality or not, I’ll choose her every time.",1,1747420268.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.6,False

Attractive, funny, guy seeks a lavender marriage with a special woman","Hey there!

I’m attractive, fit, and take care of myself, and I’m hoping to find a kind, open-minded woman who’s interested in a partnership that’s equal parts best friendship, travel buddy, and life teammate.

About me
- I love the idea of creating a warm, picture-perfect life together—think holiday cards, cozy dinners, and maybe even a dog or two.

- I’m financially stable, emotionally mature, and ready to build something meaningful.

What I’m looking for:

- You’re kind, fun, and excited about creating a life that looks traditional on the outside but is built on our unique bond.
- Kids? I’m totally open if you have them already, or even to having kids together down the line if our relationship grows strong enough.

- I’m open to starting long-distance with calls, video chats, and visits to build our connection.

- Honesty and communication are non-negotiable. Let’s be besties who can talk about anything!

*Today is the day. You look hot, and you are killing it in life*

At least that is what I tell myself as I look in the mirror at what I had become. It has been one whole year since my divorce finalized. My best friend planned a getaway to get me out of the negative slump I am in.

Note to younger self, do not get married straight out of high school just to escape your small-town problems. The problems just follow you all the way across the country. And I learned that you cannot escape the pain.

Well, I am looking forward to a few days on a faraway tropical island, miles from the real world. For once, it would be nice to escape a reality that involved Jared. I thought that once I divorced that man, my life would go on like a breeze.

Never in a million years did I think he would jump ship with the newspaper. And I was shocked to see he joined the team at the magazine company I work for. I roll my eyes every time that I have to address him as Mr. White, my boss. Gross.

Women in the office do not acknowledge me because I decided to divorce him. He is a real charmer, and no woman could understand why I would divorce a man like that. A total catch, if you like catching a broken heart with a six-pack under that button-up.

Our relationship was not bad until the end. There was a time in my life that I needed him to heal and cope with things. He used to be there for me. That time has come and gone.

I thought that moving to the city would be good for us, but it only changed us. He flourished in the city and the social life. Me, on the other hand, I became introverted and co-dependent.

I had only been with one man and had no clue what I wanted out of life. No one taught me how to talk to a boy or how to have a mutually beneficial relationship. Everyone just used or tormented me, so why try at all?

Most people wondered why he settled for a girl like me, and they bullied me about it. I am a shy girl with big secret ambitions, but I tend to keep to myself too much. No wonder I have not been on a date since my marriage had ended. It was not just because needed time to grieve for the love I had lost; it was because this world is full of people with cruel intentions.

Jared started dating the second our separation was stamped by the county clerk. I would not put it past him to slide his number to the clerk because she was young and beautiful. He liked anything that sparkled and did not seem to appreciate what he had.

I thought I could be beautiful with a little effort, but the only person I was kidding was myself. He would have cheated on me, even if I were a runway fashion model. I guess that is why he got his secretary pregnant a month after our divorce.

Consumed with packing when I heard the slamming of the front door. The noise pulled me from my thoughts, but this building was safe. I have never been scared to live here as a single woman in the city.

Peeking out of my door, I see Jenny rush to her room like she was being chased by a swarm of bees. The doorman in the lobby knows who she is because I gave her my spare key. This is her home away from home.

Jenny ""technically"" lives with her parents and is not allowed to move out until she gets married. I let her stay here with me for sleepovers. I have a guest room that she has personalized to her liking.

She brings all her dates here so that her parents think she is as innocent as she looks. She has pale silky skin, flawless curly red hair, and the perfect runner’s body. Slim and fit. Her librarian-style glasses showcase her icy blue eyes, and the lack of makeup makes her a natural beauty.

Since I do not bring guys home, she just texts me a heads-up that she has a guy over. That gives me time to hit up a local cafe to catch up on my reading list or watch live performances. Jenny is a free spirit, and I was happy to call her my best friend.

I am the opposite of Jenny. I am shy, quiet, and reclusive. My self-confidence left long before Jared and I split. Not sure that I knew what confidence felt like.

Not having a mother teach me how to be a woman was my excuse. I used it all of my life to justify not living life to the fullest. Jenny had been trying to help push me in the right direction and teach me how to be a woman.

It was normal for me not to put any effort into myself, and I am okay with that... I think. I have sworn off love, sex, and men in general. Jenny thinks that I need to put myself out there, but I do not even know where to begin.

Hopefully, this trip would help me find my sense of adventure and love for life. I wanted to be more like Jenny, free-spirited and sexually adventurous. She keeps telling me that good sex will solve all of my problems.

She did all our shopping for the trip, so I am sure that she is in her room packing my outfits before I protest. Maybe this trip will be good for me, maybe I will even get laid. Being that I have only been with Jared… I am freaking out a little.

Jenny pops out of her room and walks towards my room with a devious smile.

“Hey Leah, I am just about finished packing *OUR* bags. The only things you need to pack are your toiletries and a carry-on. We are going to be so hot! Also, I checked online, and our flight is on time. We need to leave in about 2 hours so that we can make it through TSA with enough time to hit the bar before our flight. Are you almost ready to go?”

“I am, just have to finish packing my bag. Hey, where are we going?! You are being so secretive.”, I protest.

“LEAH! You are not bringing anything! Seriously! I will pay the baggage handlers to lose your bag!”, she walked over to me and grabbed my hands.

“I swear it will be fun and you will turn heads in everything you wear…or do not wear!”, she winked as she let go and slapped my butt.

My face was full of fear and confusion as I stared at her.

“Seriously, loosen up and live a little. Do not be a negative Nancy! We are going to a tropical island in another country to relax while sipping on daiquiris and getting laid! I heard about this place from a friend of a friend.” She exclaimed.

My adoptive mother’s name was Nancy, and she was very negative. Jenny liked to call me that to make me mad and push me into whatever horrible plan she had made for us. She was the fun and adventurous one… not me.

But I just scoffed “Fine”, crossed my arms, and stomped around my room like a pouting child.

All I could hear was her laughing as she went back to her room.

Okay, two hours… two hours. What to do? I have been ready since I woke up. As much as I am dreading this trip, I am also secretly excited.

Jenny made me get my passport a few years back. We had intentions of traveling the world and seeing the most exotic places. Jared never let me go away, and then I was too depressed to travel after the divorce. I did not have any intentions of traveling, but I am glad she made plans for us.

She was in full control of our trip and our appearances.

I do not own any makeup, just a habit that I got from my marriage. At first, he loved my natural beauty, but by the end of our relationship, he was superficial. In the end, he started telling me what I could wear, where I could go, and what I could to do.

We had been together since I was 15, and we got married at 18, but we were friends for 6 years first. He was what I needed when I met him and as we grew, we drifted in different directions. Now that we are over, I needed to start living for myself.

What Jenny said just popped into my head again.

What did she mean about not wearing anything?

Pulling out my phone, I Googled countries with nude beaches. Everything I read says that you do not have to go nude, phew. Not ready to live that wild yet.

I am comfortable in a one-piece and with a few drinks I might squeeze into a two-piece, but I would *NEVER* go nude. It looks like other countries are more open to displaying sexuality and nudity. The good ‘old U.S. of A can be a prude, but I like it that way.

Well, I guess I can take a little nap before we go. If I stay on Google, then I will not be able to relax.

As I dozed off; I tell myself, nothing will go wrong. It is just a getaway to a tropical island to relax and refresh before I start a new chapter in my life. Jenny knows I am not wild and crazy.

But then again, I did not plan the trip...Lure

Fear and anxiety creeping into my dreams caused me to wake in a panic. I should have been dreaming of sunbathing on white sand with clear water as far as the eye can see. Instead, I dreamed we woke up naked on a boat lost at sea.

I rubbed my face, hoping Jenny had planned a quiet and relaxing trip. Somewhere that took us away from the bustling city life and let us unwind. My ticket was already booked, so it was not like she was giving me a choice.

Jenny liked adventure and planned to wait until her 30s to settle down. I am unsure if I ever wanted to settle down again because the first time ended in a disaster. Maybe this trip will help me lose myself and live on the edge.

Mid-twenties and divorced are not great attributes for a dating profile. Thankful that Jared and I did not have any children. I could not imagine co-parenting with him. That thought makes me cringe.

Not having a biological mother as a child helped me decide that I do not want children. Children are a lifelong commitment, and I am sure I would suck. Now, if I could keep myself from falling in love, I could save myself from having that conversation with a guy.

Jenny had the right idea, not settling down until after thirty. That should have been my plan. Now I need the courage to make a new plan to follow. Like giving myself the next five years to live out my wildest dreams... first, I need to find some wild dreams.

I have no clue what I want or what path to follow. Something has to change. I have to change. If not then, I will end up a cat-loving spinster.

My life consists of work, hanging out at home in my pajamas, or going to the café. It is rare for the café to get lit on Friday nights, so I had no plans on meeting adventurous people there. Maybe I will join Jenny on her escapade to sleep with every guy in New York, then disappear from embarrassment when I snap back to reality.

I could always move far away and start over in a place where no one knew my past. Jenny kept me tied to New York, but my heart and soul longed to be somewhere else. Too many bad memories attached to seeing my ex daily.

Jenny came barging into my room and jumped onto my bed. She was always overly excited and seemed to roll with the punches. Seriously jealous of her carefree life.

""Girl, get up. Time for shots before we go! One for you and 3 for me!”, she had a bottle and two little necklace glasses for us.

No part of me wanted to wear a symbol that symbolized *feed me alcohol*, but I did it for her. And a little for myself.

“Time to ditch this life for a new one! At least for a few days.” Jenny said as she poured a round.

“Oh no, no, there is no way that I can handle all this liquor. And you want me to drink at the airport? What are you trying to do? Are we supposed to remember any of this trip? Are you going to drag me all the way to the resort?” I rambled.

“Stop with the questions! Don’t make me say it. You know I will go there.” Jenny retorted with a sassy attitude and a hand on her hip.

I knew what she would say, so I passed on a rebuttal. She loved calling me a negative Nancy. Knowing it made my blood boil to prove her wrong.

""Come on now, you have been depressed far too long. It is time to move on with someone new. This trip is closing that chapter of your life!"", she smiled.

""It's not easy to just close it, Jenny. I loved him. He was my first and only love."", I really did need to snap out of this.

""Have some drinks and relax. Who knows? You may even meet some sexy hunk at the resort! Now shots, shots, shots!"", she knew how to pep-talk me.

Did I mention that Jenny was an avid drinker? Not me. But I was happy to oblige in the spirit of fun and freedom. We took 3 more shots and set off outside, where we hailed a cab to take us to the airport.

It did not take long to get a cab in the city, especially at this time of the day. Cab drivers pull over for two girls standing on the average curb, especially in front of my apartment building.

I did well for myself and wanted a nice place to live, so I joined the mile-long waitlist for an apartment at the prestigious Vanity High-rise complex. It was close to work, the business district, and shopping.

Everything was within walking distance, so what I saved on a car and insurance went toward my rent. Jenny also helped since she slept over 4-5 nights a week. I made enough to spend and invest in a life worth living.

It was a quick ride to the airport with the usual sights, like tall skyscrapers and people walking to get somewhere fast. We slid out of the backseat while the cab driver took our bags to the Delta baggage check outside. Jenny had checked us in on the drive over and downloaded some e-tickets.

Still unsure of where we were going. Now I am starting to worry we may end up in a shack in the middle of an island off the coast of Mexico. Then again, being kidnapped would be better than living a mundane life.

We made it through the TSA checkpoint in record time because we joined in with the flow of moving foot traffic. People really do walk very fast here. Good thing Jenny had us sign up for a TSA Pre-check. It was nice to be able to keep my shoes on and skip the wait.

I noticed that international airports are a lot bigger than regular ones. I had only flown one other time. That was when Jared took me away from our hometown and moved us to New York.

Walking through the bustling airport, I kept looking at all the shops as we walked toward the food court. Restaurants, shops, and bars. Jenny pulled us into this little gentleman's bar. It was dimly lit with rich, dark wood all around. It was giving me 1920s vibes and cigar lounge fumes.

There was a bar in the middle, and scattered around were small coffee tables surrounded by four red leather chairs each. The bartender even wore a flat hat and had a handlebar mustache. It was not very busy, and it looked like no women frequented the place.

While it was a quiet and smokey atmosphere, something gave me a chill. Almost like I was being watched. It felt like eyes were roaming my body and studying my every move.

I looked around, and there were only a few men. None that I could see looking directly at me. Unsure of what direction it was coming from, but it provoked a heated and sensual vibe within me. We walked past a few men, and they went from talking to silent, acting as if we were the plague or here to commit corporate espionage.

The heated feeling came and went as we sat at one of the little tables. I kept looking around because there had to be someone in the room watching me. Yet nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

The men were either drinking their bourbon neat, ruffling through files, or puffing on a cigar with closed eyes as if that was the best thing they had put in their mouths this week. Unable to shake that heated feeling the entire time.

We were far from dressed to attract a man but very comfortable in our travel clothing. I dressed down on purpose because dressing like a bum ensured we didn't pick up men at the airport. Whoever was staring at me was probably wondering why I was in a nice bar in athleticwear.

There was not much time to kill. Just long enough to have a few drinks and catch up on Jenny’s latest hookup series. I was happy to leave but annoyed that she still would not tell me where we were going.

As we walked up to gate C48, Cancun was displayed on the screen and in bold letters. I tried remembering the internet search to gauge where we were going, but it was time to board. Once we slipped into our economy seats, I set myself up for a nap.

It was supposed to be a long flight. The total time from boarding to landing would be several hours. I would have brought my laptop, but Jenny told me to watch the men, not my work. She really wanted me to break out of this shell.

Nudging Jenny, “I hope we have a good pilot because I heard others saying there will be a lot of turbulence.”.

“Leah, relax babe. I fly all the time. Trust the pilot.”, she assured me.

“My heart is racing, and I feel like I am being watched.”, I hinted at my feeling.

“I know what you need!”, she leaned in to whisper in my ear.

“What?”, I asked, hoping for a cure to my fears.

“Find whoever is watching you, take them to the bathroom, and bang it out.”, she giggled.

“Oh my gosh, what?! I can not do that.”, I gasped.

“Sure, you can. An orgasm is proven to cure anxiety. Trust me.”, she wiggled back down in the seat, smiling.

Stunned at her words, I still felt like I was being watched as passengers boarded. It was that same intense heat, but I shook it off as pre-flying jitters. Maybe Jenny was right, but I couldn’t possibly lure a person to the bathroom for sex… could I",1,1747420242.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I don't know if this is the place to share doubts or if I'm being inconvenient, but I promise I'll also share a cup of successful extraction in the future if I get back on course.
When I started doing aeropress, I boiled my water to 100ºC and extracted for 1min10sec. The cup I got had a rich thick body and balanced full flavours.
Recently, I saw some videos saying that when you had boiling water it can increase acidity, so I bought a kettle and thermometer and started brewing at 85ºC (most common value I saw). After this, I increased extraction time to 1min45sec but I never got the same extractions as before: the body of the coffee never got so thick and the flavours not so intense.
As anyone been through this and has some insightful tips?
I used the AeroPress Flow Control Filter Cap on all extractions and the same coffee ground finely to increase resistance. Plunging time of around 1 minute.
Sorry for all the detail and once again sorry if this is not the place for doubts, just asking for guidance.
Thanks in advance and good brewing to all.

1ko866h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ko866h/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me_and_neither_do_my/,I don’t know what’s wrong with me (and neither do my local doctors),"Do you like an intriguing case of diffuse symptoms? Then grab some popcorn and sit down. You’re in for a fun ride.

I (23f) have been dealing with a variety of health issues over the past 18 months. I’ll take you through the story chronologically. 

Between 2014-2024 I had been dealing with minor mental issues such as anxiety and depression, but no physical issues. Nothing serious but worth a mention before we start I guess.

I started 2024 of by getting stomach sick. After the flu (or whatever you want to call it) had stopped plaguing me, I continued having issues with eating. Woke up every morning feeling ill and experienced loss of appetite. This persisted from January to April. 

In April 2024, I experienced 9/10 eye pain in my right eye and after a couple of days (slow health care system) I got to an ophthalmologist and a neurologist who concluded it was a case of optic neuritis. I took cortisone pills for 5 days and the pain subsided into a weak, dull pain. On the fifth day of taking the cortisone medicine, however, I started experiencing excruciating pain in my face. Like a ball of metal wire moving through my face. When I laid on my side, it would feel as if my head was overflowing with heavy liquid. My neck got super swollen/stiff. I was having tension headaches, as if a heavy and way too tight helmet had been permanently mounted to my head. Pain pills barely helped. I experienced an uncomfortable sensation of something being lodged in my throat, making it hard to breathe. I couldn’t eat anything but soup. I couldn’t go out for walks without having crushing headaches (on top of the painful and persisting tension headache). I went to the ICU/ER twice due to trouble breathing, high resting heart rate, and experienced loss of feeling. In hind-sight it was most likely extreme panic due to not knowing what was wrong with me + being under constant unexplainable pain. All of this I continuously experienced between April and July of 2024. In August it started to feel better. I could go out for walks again and tried to enjoy the last bit of summer. 

During the fall of 2024 I continued to experience tension headaches daily, although at a much lesser pain level than previously. I started to feel dizzy almost every day. I still experienced morning sickness most days. My eye sight never recovered, my right eye now seeing less light and unable to see words properly, as well as being very dry. The uncomfortable feeling in my throat persisted. I also started to experience loss of ability of controlling my gasses and also experiencing a lot more involuntary burping. I started to feel and hear bouts of air travelling up my esophagus, usually after eating and/or drinking. My stomach started to make weird noises (kind of like it does when you haven’t eaten in a while, but accompanied with a gurgling sensation). I started to experience stomach pain (I now experience stomach pain daily, always onset in the early evening). I also started experiencing a painful sensation in my lower stomach a couple of times a week. I started to experience weaker urination as well as not being able to controll it as much (for example some of it would drip down my leg while on the toilet, which had never happened before). I started experiencing painful sensations during sex with my partner, rendering us unable to do any penetration. I started feeling tired every day, sometimes to the point of falling asleep on my desk in the middle of the day, despite having 8+ hours of rest. I started getting ear/jaw problems, i.e. feeling like something was constantly pulling my ear/ears hard, sometimes accompanied by painful sensations. The insides of my ears started to hurt really bad if I went out and it was cold or cold winds, which I had never experienced before.

It’s now May 2025 and during the spring of this year I’ve also started experiencing sensations of inner vibrations/buzzing, primarily in lower body areas (thigh, shins, left foot, middle of the stomach, lower stomach, sometimes lower back) daily. I’ve also developed eczema on one hand and on the underside of my upper arms. And I’m still dealing with previously mentioned issues. 

This all affects me greatly; I avoid irl social interaction besides my partner and my family as I need to lay down often due to stomach pain and/or dizziness, usually onset in the afternoons/evenings. I feel a lot of shame due to the involuntary gass leakage and the sounds my esophagus and stomach makes after eating/drinking. I experience lack of confidence due to not being able to be fully intimate with my partner anymore. I experience lack of joy due to having daily issues with my eyes, as I used to love reading every day. Despite being 23, I can’t go out partying with my friends (dizziness, tiredness, fluctuating pain) like normal 23 year olds do. I’ve recently also experienced a ”whistling” noise when I breathe through my nose, a somewhat blocked feeling in the roof of my mouth, and a pinching feeling sometimes in the middle of my face (as if something pinches my face from the inside, very uncomfortable). 

Other recent or semi-recent health developments, that however does not affect me negatively (at least to my knowledge), are: skin changes on like 2 moles and ~10kg/22lbs weight gain. 

I drink coffee weekly, I eat a balanced diet (veggies, fruit, protein, carbohydrates daily; seldom candy and other processed foods), I drink plenty of water, I barely ever drink alcohol, and I make sure to go out every day. I have taken a rather considerable amount of ibuprofen over the past few months. I don’t feel stressed in general, but I feel stressed about my health and for the lack of help I get from doctors here. 

During the past 18 months I’ve had numerous doctors visits (not to much avail), I’ve had 2 MRI:s of my head and neck, I’ve had a spinal cord exam, I’ve had a throat MRI and I’ve tried medicine for reducing stomach acid (omeprazole, esomeprazole). 

My boyfriend was actually the one to suggest I post my issues on reddit, as the doctors where I live seems stumped on what’s going on with me. I’m not scared it’s terminal, but I am stressed about how it affects my daily life and greatly lowers my quality of life, as well as the prospect of maybe never solving what it is/never getting better. 

So - if you have any ideas, any experience, or just about any inkling what’s wrong with me (and how I can fix it, or at least regulate it and get better), feel free to share your thoughts with me. I appreciate any and all informed suggestions and ideas. 🌸",1,1747420202.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Cute, funny, gay man seeking a lavender marriage/partnership with special woman","Hey there! I’m a 32-year-old gay guy looking for a special kind of connection—a lavender marriage with a wonderful woman who wants to build a life that looks like the classic “white picket fence” dream, but with a twist. I’m attractive, fit, and take care of myself, and I’m hoping to find a kind, open-minded woman who’s interested in a partnership that’s equal parts best friendship, travel buddy, and life teammate.

About me
- I love the idea of creating a warm, picture-perfect life together—think holiday cards, cozy dinners, and maybe even a dog or two.
- Big into shopping (I have a weakness for a good sale), playing tennis (let’s hit the courts!), and curling up with a great book.
- I’m a good listener, love to laugh, and I’m always up for planning our next adventure.
- I’m financially stable, emotionally mature, and ready to build something meaningful.

What I’m looking for:
- A woman who’s open to a lavender marriage (mutual respect and clear boundaries are key).
- You’re kind, fun, and excited about creating a life that looks traditional on the outside but is built on our unique bond.
- Kids? I’m totally open if you have them already, or even to having kids together down the line if our relationship grows strong enough.
- Bonus points if you love to travel, enjoy a good shopping spree, or have a passion for life’s little joys.

The plan:
- I’m open to starting long-distance with calls, video chats, and visits to build our connection.
- Eventually, I’d love for us to live together and create that shared life—think matching coffee mugs and epic vacation plans.
- Honesty and communication are non-negotiable. Let’s be besties who can talk about anything!

https://preview.redd.it/f93tnctus61f1.png?width=1946&format=png&auto=webp&s=476059d3d5817ad13a82a9578917dbb098fdee3f

# EmbyIcons Plugin

# Overview

**EmbyIcons** is a plugin for [Emby Server](https://emby.media/) that overlays audio and subtitle language icons directly onto media posters. This provides a quick visual summary of available languages in your media, making browsing your library more informative and visually appealing.

# Features

* Supports detection of external subtitle files (`.srt`).
* Overlays language icons on posters with user-configurable size and alignment.
* Restricts icon overlay to selected libraries by name.
* Enables separate toggling of audio and subtitle icons.
* Configurable list of languages to detect and display icons for.
* Adjustable icon size as a percentage of the poster's shorter dimension.
* Plugin logging with configurable log folder location.
* Maps common language codes internally for consistent icon naming.

# Installation

1. Make sure you have the latest Emby version as this plugin might be incompatible with older and non x64/amd64 versions!
2. Place the EmbyIcons.dll into your Emby Server's plugin directory.
3. Restart Emby Server to load the plugin.
4. Open the Emby Server dashboard and navigate to **Plugins**.
5. Configure the plugin settings from the plugin page.

# Configuration Options

|Setting|Description|
|:-|:-|
|**Icons Folder Path**| `eng.png` `srt.eng.png`Directory containing language icon PNG files (e.g., , ).|
|**Icon Size**|Size of icons as a percentage of the poster’s shorter side (e.g., 10%).|
|**Audio Icon Alignment**|`TopLeft` `TopRight` `BottomLeft` `BottomRight`Corner where audio icons are displayed ( , , , ).|
|**Subtitle Icon Alignment**|Corner where subtitle icons are displayed.|
|**Audio Languages to Detect**|Comma-separated list of ISO language codes for audio streams to overlay icons for.|
|**Subtitle Languages to Detect**|Comma-separated list of ISO language codes for subtitle streams.|
|**Show Audio Icons**|Enable or disable audio language icon overlays.|
|**Show Subtitle Icons**|Enable or disable subtitle icon overlays.|
|**Restrict to Libraries**|Comma-separated list of library names to restrict icon overlays to; leave empty for all libraries.|
|**Enable Logging**|Enable or disable plugin logging.|
|**Log Folder Path**|Directory where plugin logs are saved.|

>

# Troubleshooting

* Verify the icon folder path contains correctly named PNG icons for your languages.
* Library names might need quotetation marks around them on some systems eg. ""Movies"". I'm looking into this.
* Check the `EmbyIcons.log` file (in the configured log folder) for processing details and errors.
* Ensure media files have proper language tags on audio and subtitle streams.

**Initial Building**

At the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling productivity subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. This is when I stumbled on the concept of habit stacking - the idea of linking new habits to existing ones. I started small: after pouring my morning coffee, I would write the three tasks I needed to get done for the day. After brushing my teeth, I would meditate for five minutes.

I needed a way to keep track of the growing sequential habits but none of the apps I found on the AppStore really captured the way how habits naturally flowed together - so I spent my weekends and hours after work since developing [Chayn](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-routine-chayn/id6741157498). It was a steep learning curve, but I managed to launch it a few months ago with the following key features:

* 😊 Track your moods
* 🔥 Keep track of total time spent on habits + streaks
* 🎨 Customise each habit and habit stack to your liking
* 🔍 Make your habits as detailed or as simple as you want

**After Launch and Feedback**

Getting not one, but multiple users pay for the product and support development was a huge milestone for me. However, after some user feedback, I realised that the app needed more work and new features. The users mostly requested the following:

#  For Sale By Owner; part 2

#     Having a humble, obedient, submissive sissy slut slave at my beck and call has quickly gone from being a delightful luxury to an absolute necessity, and it is hard for me to imagine now how I ever managed without one. To think that I used to actually have to get my own meals, clean my own house, do my own laundry, and worst of all, suffer the frustration and indignity of being stuck in a sexually unsatisfying relationship with an inadequate lover! Well, never again! Now that former lover is my sissy slave, does all the housework and serves me, and the wide variety of lovers I am now free to enjoy, in anyway I desire.

#      That is why I could never actually sell the slut, as I could not now imagine living without a humble, obedient, live-in sissy slave, and the thought of having to train another from scratch is no fun either. I must say, though, that having the slut THINK that I am planning to sell her, and making her take out an ad on an alternative sexuality website, offering herself up for sale is, if I do say so myself, one of the most brilliant ideas I have ever come up with for degrading, humiliating and tormenting the slut, and ensuring her obedience to me. It has the combined benefits of keeping her in a near constant state of extreme mental anguish, the very thought of which makes me very hot, wet and horny for some reason, and it also induces her to strive ever harder to please me, in her desperate efforts to influence me to decide to keep her after all, as well as providing a new and rich source and variety of people to use, abuse, humiliate and degrade her, as people respond to the ad and make arrangements to come by and “test drive” her.

#     Naturally, I let everyone who responds to the ad know right up front that this is really just a ploy to torment the slut and heighten her humiliation, degradatation and feelings of complete powerlessness under my ownership and control, and so far almost all of them have found the idea very amusing and happily taken part in the charade. Only one, a very wealthy middle eastern businessman who really wanted just such a pre-trained sissy slut to own for his own amusement and as a party favor for his friends and business acquaintances, seemed greatly disappointed at first. He was in fact very hard to convince to take no for an answer, and to just go along with the game. He even offered me an outrageously unheard of sum of money for the slut, which I have to admit was very tempting, as it was considerably more than I make in a year, and I make pretty good money as a designer and fashion consultant. The very fact, though, that he, with all his wealth, was so eager to pay so much for my slut slave made me realize how precious, and apparently not that easy to find, a really well trained sissy slave is, and only heightened my resolve to keep her.

#      Eventually, he was able to be convinced just to play along with the trick, though rather than just coming by to try out the slut at my home, as most respondents to the ad had done, he insisted on paying me an also amazingly large sum to rent her to him outright for a few days. He actually wanted her for at least a week, but I was not willing to go that long without my house being cleaned, my laundry done, and eating in even the fine restaurants that I could easily afford with what he paid me, so we settled on three days. Of course the slut was kept ignorant of this arrangement, and when he took her away, she actually believed that she had been sold to him and would never see me again, but would now live the rest of her life as his slave, until or unless he decided to give or sell her to someone else. The agonized, teary-eyed look of adoration, longing, and abject terror that the slut gave me as he dragged her out the door by a leash just about made me orgasm without even touching myself! It was incredible!

#      In order to keep the slut in the dark about the true nature of this elaborate ruse, we had prearranged, when he returned her to me, for him to make a pretense of complaining that she had turned out to be unsatisfactory for some reason, and demand his money back. When he did bring her back to me and threw her roughly to the floor at my feet tearfully gasping, sobbing and moaning, she was a total mess, and my pussy instantly got all wet and tingly just imagining what she had suffered while in his possession. She was dressed in an elaborate belly dancer’s costume, but it was very torn and disheveled, her makeup was a complete mess, and her face, hair and costume were caked with old, dried stains, as well as new, fresh gobs of thick, white cum. She started blubbering and sobbing and reached out to embrace and kiss my feet, but I shouted, “Ewwww! Get your filthy, cummy face off my nice, clean shoes, you stupid slut!” and kicked her away, then reached down, grabbed a handful of her sticky, matted hair and dragged her on her knees into the bathroom and over to the toilet, where I shoved her face into the bowl and closed the lid over her head.

#      “Stay there and think about what a disappointment you have been to me, bitch, while I go see just what you have done to cause me such embarrassment and cost me such a lucrative sale!” I growled at her, as I prepared to go talk to the gentleman, under the pretense of returning his money and listening to his complaints, but really just to get all the juicy details of whatever had gone on over the last few days, which judging by the looks of things had in fact undoubtedly been quite enjoyable for him and his friends, though quite an ordeal for my lowly little slut. “I will deal with the matter of your punishment when I get back,” I spat at the whore, and then, quite as an afterthought, but realizing that I had to pee anyway, lifted the toilet lid off her head, squatted down and released a bladder full of urine all over the back of her head saying, “Here’s a shower to start getting you cleaned up from your miserable failure, cunt!” before replacing the lid down on her head and stalking briskly out of the room. It is impossible to describe the intensity of the thrill that I got from her utterly pitiful sobs echoing out of the toilet bowl as I stormed away from her!

#      The gentleman was very kind, and far from taking any money back from me, actually insisted on giving me an astonishingly large additional sum on top of the rather princely rental fee he had already paid me when he took the slut! I asked him what had happened, and he told me in long and intimate detail the whole tale of the three days, which would make an entire story in and of itself, and which therefore I will not relate here. Suffice it to say that he had not been disappointed at all, but had greatly enjoyed the use of my slut (as had many of his friends), and he entreated me again to reconsider and accept an even larger sum than his original offer to sell her to him. Tempting though this new offer was, I still felt I had to turn it down, which he said he understood. He then insisted on taking me out to the finest restaurant in the city for dinner, and this offer I graciously accepted. He was, after all, quite suave, handsome, debonair and a very intelligent, refined gentleman, not to mention being obviously almost inconceivably rich. I almost forgot about my slut kneeling with her head in the toilet, but then I figured that a few hours kneeling with her piss and cum soaked head in my toilet would still be almost like heaven to her, compared to what she had just gone through for the last three days in this gentleman’s possession, thinking that that was going to be her lot for the rest of her life.

#      Many hours later, when we returned to my home after a long, exquisitely luxurious dinner, I had had so many glasses of fine wines, champagnes, cognac and apertifs that I literally did forget all about the slut until this wonderful, kind and exotic gentleman and I were in my bed together, preparing to make love. When Isuddenly remembered her, it occured to me for a brief instant to drag her in and have her service us while we made love. As soon as I remembered what a filthy, nasty state the slut was in, however, I discarded the idea immediately, and spent a beautiful, passionate night alone with my new lover, while the slut remained all night on her knees in the bathroom, her cummy, pissy face in the toilet, undoubtedly imagining that she had failed me miserably, and agonizing over what her punishment might be. Little did she know that she had opened a new, beautiful and wonderful chapter in my life by bringing this gentleman to me. I certainly wasn’t about to tell her.

#      After awakening in the morning, my new lover and I made wild, passionate love again several times before getting up to go to the bathroom and shower together. As we entered the bathroom, we saw the slut, still on her knees with her face in the bowl and the lid down over her head, fast asleep. I guess it had been a rougher three days for her even than the gentleman had described to me. I started to burst out laughing at the sight of the whore sleeping with her face in the toilet, but my new lover motioned for me to be quiet, and I stifled my laughter, watching to see what he had in mind. Nimble as a tiger stalking its prey, he crept over to the slut, knelt down behind her, and in one swift, smooth motion, pulled down her panties and the flimsy, sheer, see-through pants of the belly dancer outfit he had dressed her in, and rammed his long, thick cock into her exposed asshole. At this point I could not restrain my laughter as the slut let out a pitiful, startled, frightened yelp at being awakened by this gentleman’s hard, strong member entering her from the rear. It was jst too funny, and the little cunt’s whining, moans and sobs emanating from under the toilet seat as my gentleman friend proceeded to fuck her hard, fast and furiously in her sissy ass made me very hot and wet.

#      Deciding to join the fun, rather than just watch, I went over, lifted the toilet seat off the slut’s head, and sliding down onto the toilet in front of my sissy slave’s face, grabbed her by a handful of her hair and pulled her mouth into my pussy, making her lick and suck the matted, dried come from the night before and the fresh gobs from that morning’s lovemaking from my cunt, ass and pubic hair. Her whines, moans and groans now were stifled in my hot, wet bush as my lover’s thrusts into her rear shoved her face rhythmically, repeatedly, deep into my juicy twat. It was not long before I was ready to come, and as I did so, I released a long, hard stream of hot piss into my slave’s mouth, commanding her to drink and swallow it all. As I was finishing, my lover winked at me and told the slut to save a mouthful, then yanked her head back roughly by the hair, pulled his cock out of her ass, stood over her and incredibly (considering that he had already come several times that morning while making love with me), let fly a huge, gooey load of sperm all over the sissy’s face and into her mouth. It was SO funny to watch, I couldn’t help but burst out laughing again. It went everywhere; in the slut’s face, her eyes, her hair, on her costume, but most of it went into her mouth, globbing up and swirling around in the mouthful of my hot, bitter, salty piss that the slut was holding there.

#      When he had finished cumming in her mouth, my lover commanded her to gargle, and joined in my uproarious laughter as we both watched our own secretions roiling, bubbling and gurgling around in my sissy slave’s upturned mouth. It really was just too funny to describe. Eventually the gentleman grabbed the slut by the jaw and forehead and forced her mouth closed on the messy mixture, commanding her to swallow it. Some of it had bubbled out of her mouth as she gargled it and trickled down the slut’s face and body to the floor, and he then shoved her face roughly into the puddle of it in which she was now kneeling in front of the toilet, and made her lick it up from the floor.

#      Once the floor was cleaned to my satisfaction, my lover tore off what remained of my slut’s belly dancer costume, made her lie in the tub on her back, and standing over her in the tub, proceeded to piss all over her from head to toe, rinsing away three days of caked, dried cum. He paid special attention to her face and mouth, which he made her hold wide open and swallow whatever went into it. I found that I still had a few squirts left in me, too, and stood over the slut and joined my lover in showering her with both of our piss. Then we turned on the shower and luxuriated in it together, making the slut soap, scrub and wash our entire bodies while we kissed and fondled each other and verbally degraded and humiliated the sissy slave serving us. After finishing our shower and having the slut dry us off, we returned to my bedroom to get dressed, leaving the slut with a command to get herself dried off, get dressed in her skimpiest, sexiest maid’s uniform, and have coffee, bacon and eggs and toast waiting for us in the dining room, as we would be down directly for her to serve them to us.

#      After we had enjoyed our breakfast and the slut had cleared and cleaned the dishes, then prepared and eaten her own meal by scraping our leftovers into the blender and pureeing them, then slurping up the resulting mush from her bowl on the kitchen floor (topped off, amazingly, by yet another large, full cum load by my astoundingly virile lover), it was time for my gentleman friend to leave, and the slut and I were left alone. Now I had to decide what her punishment was to be for the supposed offense of failing to satisfy her (unbeknownst to her) pretend “buyer.” After all, if she weren’t punished for this, she might start to catch on that the whole thing was a sham, an elaborate game at her expense, and I was having way too much fun with it to stop now. Just as I sat down to mull the matter over, however, idly fucking the slut’s throat with a large dildo as she knelt before me and I contemplated the matter, however, the doorbell rang, and I had to send the hapless bitch scurrying to answer it. It turned out to be two of my favorite gentleman friends, a couple of big, strong, manly, incredibly well-hung black dudes I had met at a reggae concert the previous year. It quickly became clear that they had come over hoping to get laid, but I was not in the mood for any more sex at the moment, so I decided to go out shopping, but invited them to stay and help themselves to the slut’s services if they liked. They readily agreed to this, and by the time I had gathered my things, put on my coat and was headed out the door, the nasty whore was already on her hands and knees on the floor, moaning in rhythm to the motion of two huge, black cocks forcing themselves into her simultaneously from the front and rear.

#      “We’ll talk later about that little matter we were just discussing, OK, slut?” I called breezily over my shoulder as I headed out the door into the bright, beautiful spring sunshine, but all I got in response was a plaintive, gurgling moan.

#      “Oh, well,” I thought with a smile as I drove off to spend some of the money I had just made off the nasty little cunt, “sluts will be sluts, eh?” I would decide and inform her of how I would punish her for supposedly losing me money later, I thought, grinning from ear to ear.

# For Sale By Owner; part 3

#     The story so far: after complaining to a girlfriend who turned out to be a dominatrix (or rather, ‘humiliatrix,’ as she put it) about a boyfriend who was failing to satisfy me sexually, I went over to his place to surprise him with my decision to transform him into my submissive, sissy slut slave. Imagine my surprise when I found him dressed in my “borrowed” lingerie, fucking himself in the ass with a dildo and cumming into his own mouth! This gave me all the ammo I needed to make the transformation I intended for him immediate and permanent, and since then he (now she) has been my live-in sissy maid, slut, whore, serving me and any of the many lovers I now enjoy in any way that I or they please.

#  

#     I never thought of myself as a sadist, and it came as somewhat of a surprise to me to find what an intense sexual thrill I get from causing my nasty little sissy slave to suffer, especially mentally and emotionally. For this reason, one of the crowning glories of my enslavement of the slut was making her take out an ad on an alternative sexuality website offering herself for sale by me, and then entertaining the various men (and even a few women) who come by to “test drive” her. The intensity of anguish that this causes the nasty slut makes me all wet and tingly just thinking about.

#  Recently, an astonishingly wealthy middle eastern gentleman responded to the ad, and even though I informed him up front, as I always do, that the slut is not really for sale and that the whole thing is merely a ruse to tease and torment her, he really wanted to purchase her, and offered me a sum for her that I could barely refuse. I ended up striking a compromise with him, renting the slut to him for three days, with the sissy bitch imagining that she had finally in fact been sold outright, and then when he returned her to me, making a pretense of her not having been satisfactory for some reason.

#      This turned out to be a wonderful development for me, as this gentleman and I hit it off really well and he has now become one of my preferred lovers, and it also gave me a golden opportunity to increase even further the torment and anguish of my slave (which, as I mentioned, turns me on inexplicably intensely) who still does not know otherwise than that she was actually sold and then refused and returned to me as unacceptable.

#  With regard to punishment of my slave, I am unlike perhaps most Mistresses in that I do not particularly care for either orgasm denial or corporal punishment of my slut. I rather find that control of her orgasms to orchestrate them to be as humiliating as possible, and intense psychological torment, usually involving even more than usual humiliation and enforced depravity for her, are what really get my juices flowing, as opposed to whipping or otherwise physically torturing her. That’s too much like work! Why waste my energy physically tormenting the nasty slut when I can derive an even bigger thrill and cause her even more intense agony and discomfort by a mere twist of the mind delivered with a few short words?    That is not to say that the whore does not get slapped around plenty and receive lots of over the knee spankings, but though she may hate them and cry pitifully from them sometimes, these are not really so much punishment as simply constant reminders of her lowly status and station. Most of my male lovers especially enjoy slapping her face and spanking her ass when they are using and abusing her sexually, as do I myself, and she need not even have done anything deserving of punishment for this to be her lot.

#      No, the punishments that I most enjoy inflicting, that have the deepest and most scathing effect on the slut, are psychological in nature, almost always involving some form of extremely intensified humiliation and degradation. Examples include dragging her out to a biker bar, tying her up on her knees next to the dumpster out back, and then inviting all of the patrons at will to come out and use her sissy mouth as both cum dumpster and/or urinal. Naturally, the guys are not only alowed but actually encouraged to slap her around and be as rough as they like with her while using her, but I have learned from experience that her most intense torment (and thus my greatest thrill) is from the incredibly intense humiliation, far more even than from any physical pain, that they cause her.

#     I am a big fan of making the punishment fit the offense; for example, if there is any problem with the laundry, she might have to wear a pair of my nastiest, filthiest, most cum-drenched panties over her face, inside the penis gag that always fills her mouth whenever it is not actively servicing me or someone else of my choosing. If the dishes are not cleaned to my satisfaction, she will likely be put on a several day long diet of the sissy slut slave equivalent of bread and water — nothing but cum and urine, taken directly from the source. It is amazing how much a few days of this makes her hunger for the ground up, always cum-drenched leftovers from my meals, eaten from a bowl on the floor, that are her usual fare.

#      It is rather amazing that the slut has come to look upon such activities as licking and sucking my clit and asshole and my lover’s cock, balls and ass while we make love, or sucking and licking the cum from my hot, wet pussy and ass after I have fucked a real man, then licking and sucking him clean as well, not as punishments but privileges! Punishments are more likely to be, say, spending an entire day and night on her hands and knees chained to a toilet in a bar, sucking off all comers, her sissy ass also exposed and available for any to use, “bobbing for gobs” of cum in the toilet bowl between guys squirting their hot, juicy loads in, on and about her face and mouth. I swear the water level in the toilet will be an inch higher just from her tears after a day and night of that!

#    The most amazing thing of all is that the nasty little whore really does strive her utmost to, and in fact does do a pretty good job of pleasing and serving, not only me, but also my many friends, guests and lovers. Of course, I cannot let her know that, as I do not want to enourage any semblance of pride or complacency on her part, so that she is almost always at least on the verge of tears for having failed to please me, even while I am purring inwardly with joy and pleasure from her services. Oooh, it makes me so wet just thinking about it, I think I will go smother her for an hour or so with my ass and pussy right now! I just got back from making love to a big, strong black man, and my cunt and panties are wet and dripping with his cum — what a treat for my pathetic, loser sissy slut whore!",2,1747419866.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

1ko7z9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitnessplates/comments/1ko7z9c/indoor_cycling_bike_with_ipad_holder_lcd_monitor/,"Indoor Cycling Bike with iPad Holder, LCD Monitor, and 35 lbs Flywheel","Hey there! So, I was chatting with a friend the other day about getting fit at home, and she was *raving* about her new exercise bike. Not just any bike, mind you, but one with all the bells and whistles — iPad holder, LCD monitor, silent belt drive, and a hefty 35 lbs flywheel. I got curious, did some digging, and… wow, these bikes are a game-changer for home workouts! If you’re thinking about grabbing an **exercise bike for home**, let me walk you through why this specific setup is worth your attention. Oh, and I might slip in a story or two from my own fitness journey (spoiler: it involves a lot of coffee).

# Why Choose an Exercise Bike for Home?

Okay, let’s start with the obvious: working out at home is *convenient*. No gym membership, no driving, no waiting for someone to wipe down the equipment. But why an exercise bike over, say, a treadmill or those fancy rowing machines? Well, for one, cycling is low-impact, so it’s easier on your joints. I learned this the hard way after a brief (and painful) stint with running last summer — my knees were *not* happy.

An indoor cycling bike like this one, with its iPad holder and LCD monitor, takes things up a notch. The 35 lbs flywheel? That’s what gives you a smooth, realistic ride, like you’re actually pedaling down a trail… minus the bugs. And the silent belt drive means you can hop on at 6 a.m. without waking up the whole house. Trust me, I’ve had my share of creaky equipment that sounded like a horror movie soundtrack.

# The Perks of a 35 lbs Flywheel

Now, let’s talk about that flywheel. If you’re new to this, the flywheel is the big, heavy wheel that keeps the bike moving smoothly. At 35 lbs, it’s heavy enough to mimic the feel of a real road bike, giving you a solid workout whether you’re sprinting or climbing a virtual hill. I remember trying a cheaper bike years ago with a lighter flywheel, and it felt… wobbly, like riding a unicycle in a windstorm. A heavier flywheel like this one stabilizes your ride and lets you push harder without losing momentum.

# Silent Belt Drive: A Game-Changer

Oh, and the silent belt drive? It’s a blessing. My old exercise bike had a chain drive that squeaked louder than my neighbor’s dog. With a belt drive, you get a whisper-quiet workout, which is perfect if you’re streaming a show on that iPad holder (more on that in a sec) or sneaking in a late-night session. Plus, belts need less maintenance than chains, so you’re not stuck oiling things every other week.

# Tech That Makes Workouts Fun (Yes, Really)

Let’s be real: staying motivated to exercise is *hard*. I mean, I love the idea of being super fit, but sometimes the couch and a bag of chips win. That’s where the iPad holder and LCD monitor come in — they make workouts feel less like a chore and more like… well, fun.

# iPad Holder for Entertainment and Classes

The iPad holder is such a small detail, but it’s a total game-changer. Pop your tablet in there, fire up a cycling class on an app like Peloton or Zwift, and suddenly you’re sweating it out with a virtual instructor cheering you on. Or, if you’re like me and need a distraction, cue up a Netflix binge. I once powered through a 45-minute ride because I *had* to know what happened in that cliffhanger episode. Pro tip: secure your tablet properly — I learned the hard way when mine almost took a dive mid-sprint.

# LCD Monitor for Tracking Progress

Then there’s the LCD monitor. This little screen tracks your speed, distance, calories burned, and heart rate (if the bike has pulse sensors). I’m a bit of a data nerd, so I love seeing those numbers climb — it’s like a pat on the back for every mile. Last month, I set a goal to hit 100 miles in 30 days, and watching the monitor tick up kept me going. Plus, it’s super satisfying to look back and realize, “Hey, I burned enough calories to justify that extra latte!”

# Who’s This Bike For?

So, who’s the ideal person for this bike? Honestly, it’s pretty versatile. If you’re a beginner, the adjustable seat and handlebars make it easy to find a comfy position. If you’re more advanced, the heavy flywheel and resistance settings let you crank up the intensity. And if you’re a busy parent (or just someone with a packed schedule), the compact design and quiet operation mean you can squeeze in a workout without turning your living room into a gym.

I’ve got a friend who’s a working mom, and she swears by her bike for quick 20-minute rides during her kid’s nap time. She says the iPad holder lets her catch up on emails *and* get her heart rate up — multitasking at its finest. Me? I use mine to de-stress after a long day of SEO strategizing. There’s something about pedaling hard while blasting my favorite playlist that just… resets my brain.

# Setting Up Your Indoor Cycling Bike

Alright, let’s talk setup. Most of these bikes come partially assembled, but you’ll need to attach things like the pedals, seat, and handlebars. It’s not rocket science, but give yourself an hour and maybe bribe a friend with pizza to help. My first time setting up a bike, I got cocky and ignored the manual… big mistake. Ended up with a wobbly seat that made every ride an adventure.

# Space and Placement Tips

Make sure you’ve got enough space — about 4x6 feet is ideal. Put it on a flat surface, and maybe throw down a mat to protect your floor (and dampen any vibrations). I’ve got mine in a corner of my living room, next to a window so I can pretend I’m cycling through a forest instead of staring at my laundry pile. Oh, and keep a water bottle and towel nearby — you *will* sweat.

# Maintenance Made Easy

Good news: these bikes are low-maintenance. Wipe down the frame after sweaty sessions to prevent rust, and check the belt tension every few months. I’ve had mine for over a year, and it’s still smooth as butter. Just don’t spill your coffee on the LCD monitor… not that I’m speaking from experience or anything.

# SEO and Engagement Tips for This Bike

As an SEO nerd, I can’t help but think about how to make this bike *findable* online. If you’re a blogger or retailer promoting this bike, here’s the deal: the primary keyword “exercise bike for home” is gold. Use it in your H1 (check!), meta title, and sprinkle it naturally in the content. Related terms like “indoor cycling bike,” “stationary bike with iPad holder,” and “home cardio equipment” will help you rank for broader searches.

For meta data, try this:

* **SEO Title**: Best Exercise Bike for Home with iPad Holder (58 chars)
* **Meta Description**: Discover the ultimate exercise bike for home with iPad holder, LCD monitor, and 35 lbs flywheel. Perfect for cardio workouts! (124 chars)

For schema markup, add a **Product** schema with fields for name, description, price, and reviews. This boosts your chances of landing a rich snippet, like those star ratings in search results. And for images, use alt text like: “Indoor cycling bike with iPad holder and LCD monitor in a home gym.”

# Wrapping It Up: Why This Bike Rocks

Look, I’m not saying this bike will turn you into a Tour de France champ overnight (though, wouldn’t that be cool?). But it’s a solid, versatile piece of equipment that makes working out at home *doable* and, dare I say, enjoyable. The iPad holder keeps you entertained, the LCD monitor tracks your progress, and that 35 lbs flywheel with a silent belt drive delivers a smooth, quiet ride. Whether you’re a fitness newbie or a seasoned cyclist, this bike’s got your back… or rather, your legs.

So, what’s stopping you? Grab one, set it up, and start pedaling toward your goals. I’m rooting for you — and maybe I’ll see you in a virtual cycling class someday! [**Get yours here!**](https://amzn.to/3H0vGni)",1,1747419718.0,Fitnessplates,0,1.0,False

I needed a way to keep track of the growing sequential habits but none of the apps I found on the AppStore really captured the way how habits naturally flowed together - so I spent my weekends and hours after work since developing [Chayn](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-routine-chayn/id6741157498). It was a steep learning curve, but I managed to launch it a few months ago with the following key features:

* ⛓️ Ability to stack habits (both in sequence and in parallel)
* 😊 Track your moods
* 🔥 Keep track of total time spent on habits + streaks
* 🎨 Customise each habit and habit stack to your liking
* 🔍 Make your habits as detailed or as simple as you want

**After Launch and Feedback**

Getting not one, but multiple users pay for the product and support development was a huge milestone for me. However, after some user feedback, I realised that the app needed more work and new features. The users mostly requested the following:

* Ability to edit habit stacks
* Widgets
* Reminders
* Apple Watch Integration

Since then, I have integrated all the requested features/fixes but the last one (still working on that Apple Watch integration!). Chayn 2.0 is now out with Widgets, and I would greatly appreciate if you would try it out!

Feel free to reach out with any requests for new features and/or feedback that you might have, and I promise I will look into implementing that into the app! Thank you for reading :)",2,1747419660.0,iosapps,0,1.0,False

Eating drinking, moving around, taking medication, socializing, everything. It’s just gone. Literally overnight. One night I felt completely fine and healthy and by the morning the illness started and my life completely changed. I’m so lonely. I can’t leave my bed beyond getting up to use the bathroom. I can’t work, I can’t go on dates with my wife, I can’t go to friend’s houses, I can’t travel. My closest friends spend time with me when they can but we’re all in our mid 20’s in the height of our lives and careers. Everyone’s busy and that okay. I would never be upset by that, I genuinely understand. But I haven’t been able to talk to a person face to face in a week. My wife has been in and out of town all week for work and when she is home I’m passed out from exhaustion. We’ve talked maybe 30 minutes the whole week. I have plenty of friends and family to text but I crave social interaction so bad that I’m crying over it. Even to just go to a coffee shop and read and have some tea and be surrounded by people. But walking around makes me so dizzy and nauseous I almost pass out Everytime. I just want someone to talk to for an hour face to face. I miss my wife so much.

# ✍️ Rachel's Personal Experience

A good friend of mine, *Rachel T*, borrowed the [21-Day Keto Reset](https://theworldhealth.org/21-day-keto-reset-official) from me after we were chatting about quick weekday dinners over coffee one afternoon.

She’s a freelance illustrator who works crazy hours and told me she was tired of bouncing between keto YouTubers and random blogs that contradicted each other.

Her goal was simple: fewer sugar crashes, more brain power, and maybe fitting back into her favorite jacket before autumn.

She started the plan that weekend and messaged me two days later saying she actually looked forward to opening her fridge — which, from Rachel, is high praise.

What she loved was the fact that it's **a step-by-step keto plan with meals and a shopping list.** Nothing is left to chance. She said the lack of calorie tracking gave her “mental breathing room.”

Her only complaint? One of the recipes included capers, and she’d sooner eat paper. But that’s Rachel — dramatic about briny things. She swapped it out, carried on, and by the end of the 21 days, she’d not only lost five pounds but claimed her focus while drawing had improved, too.

“It’s like someone cleaned up the junk drawer in my brain,” she told me.

Not bad for three weeks and a grocery list.

I’m set to get composite bonding soon and my dentist explained that there is a possibility for staining and chips over the years and to expect to replace them every 5-7 years. 

I’m very vigilant with my dental care but I’m also a mother and need my two ice coffees a day. 

I only ever have iced coffee and I drink it with cream and a straw. I also always rinse with water after and then water floss and brush after some time. 

Is that still a risk of major staining? That’s my biggest concern. I don’t currently whiten my natural teeth bc I want to protect my enamel but my second question is should I have my dentist professionally whiten them prior to the bonding so that everything starts out lighter as I know it will fade over time?

I was diagnosed adhd by tele health practitioner, Cicle Med last August and prescribed Wellbutrin. I was on the sublocade shot for opiate addiction. Clearly, the practitioner stereotyped me into a group of people who shouldn't be prescribed a stimulant because of my history of self medicating with street drugs.  

Right away, I noticed a few changes. I immediately quit smoking, but my days off have been a total spiral. 

The last 7 months, my 3 day weekends are spent doing nothing at all. Getting up, brush my teeth, make coffee and go right back to bed. I stay here all day. Maybe get up to do dishes, but right back to bed. Im not a big outdoors person but when I want to go shopping, wash my car, work in the yard or visit family, I used to just do it. I still want to do all the things but dont have enough energy to overcome the constant pull to crawl back in bed. Even after starting low dose adderall for focus in October.  

It's spring! Almost summer and I spend every weekend in an energy deficient shame coma. I haven't been well since starting wellbutrin.  

I weaned down to 75mg every couple days. Its been 4 days since last dose. The withdrawals from wellbutrin are probably different for everyone. Body aches, headaches are common. That's what I've experienced as well. 

If you're feeling the same brain fog, underwhelming lack of motivation and increased depression/anxiety after wellbutrin, its not normal. Dont wait almost a year for things to improve, or believe this is as good as it gets. Talk to your doctor!!

Captain James Erikson, NAUSF

NAUSF Asteroid-Class “Madison”

June 5th, 2125

Titan, Low Orbit

We've been stationed near the New American Union's orbital research post around Titan, why, I don't know. We'd be better suited to patrolling the Kuiper Belt, sniffing out the Indian operations there or chucking torpedoes at the Chinese military posts on Thebe, but command has us here, and it's not my place to question them. The atmosphere of Titan creates a pale blue sheen over the moon, with Saturn acting as a background. Every once in a while, I see a flash of light from the surface, a missile hitting its target or an unfortunate patch of rock. I take a sip from my mug, the bitterness of my coffee hits my tongue and floods my taste buds in just the right way to wake me up. The bridge is pretty cozy, all things considered. I sit on the captain's chair in the center of the room, below me are a few dozen officers, all making sure the ship isn't under immediate threat. Looking down to my command console, I see nothing out of the ordinary, no ships without ID's, no incoming STS missiles. A calm day, or, cycle, as command seems so intent on calling them. 

“Sir?” One of the officers looks up, a Second Lieutenant Carpenter, staring at me with a wide-eyed expression. “What is it, Lieutenant?” “Contact coming from Neptune, heading straight for us.” Shit. Only one thing that could mean. “Chuck it on main.” I stand up as the view of Titan is covered by a black expanse, a green triangle representing us, a white circle for Titan, a green dot for the research station, and a blue triangle representing the unknown contact. I look down to the command console and press down on the broadcast button. “Command, this is Asteroid-Class Madison, ID 77-Zeta-Gamma-092. Unknown contact spotted, need visual.” A few seconds later, a gruff voice comes on in my earpiece. “Copy, copy, Madison. Contact location?” I look back up, it's still coming straight for us. “Zero degrees, coming straight at us, about 2000 klicks out and approaching fast.” “Copy, copy, giving visual.” The main screen switches again to a satellite in Titan's orbit, locked on to the unknown ship. It looks like a commandeered Indian or Brazilian ship, but the markings have been sprayed off. In its place is a sigil, and next to it, a line of characters I don't recognize. Then I see what's below that. “ORION UNION FIRST CONTACT SQUADRON.” 

I press down on the broadcast again. “Command, this is Madison, please tell me you're seeing what I am.” “Aye, Madison, we see it.” I stare at the image of the ship for a few more seconds, wide-eyed. “Any record of an “Orion Union” before? Maybe a ship ID?” “Nay, and the ID registers it as a European vessel. Make contact, see what they want.” “Copy copy.” I take my hand off the button and flick open the PA, turning it on. 

“Attention, all hands to battle stations, repeat, all hands to battle stations. An unknown ship is approaching, ID registers it as European, but it doesn't look like any European spaceship I've seen.” I turn off the PA and start issuing orders, the bridge now abuzz with activity. “Full power to engines, get us as close to that ship as possible, and load torpedoes!"" “Aye, sir!” Rings out across the bridge and the ship shoots off away from Titans orbit to intercept. 

It takes a tense half hour to reach the unknown ship, but we finally got within hailing range of it. “Sir! Unknown contact hailing us!” “Accept.” On screen, a massive window appears of a flag I don't recognize, flying alongside the USA's, a nation that hasn't existed since the 2020's. Text appears on it, reading. “We are representatives to the Stellar Federation of the Orion Arm. We have replicated a ship similar to your own so as to not alarm you. We hail from outside your home system. Do not be afraid.” Only text means they probably can't communicate with us verbally, if they are alien, as they say. “Respond back with a text message. Read, we are the New American Union Space Force ship Madison, state your purpose or we will be forced to fire upon you.” The comms officer relays my message to this “Orion Union” and a minute later, the text on the screen fades out and is replaced. “We require an escort to your nation's leaders. We wish to commune with them.” I can't help but crack a smile at the message, it was obvious they didn't know much about our culture, considering they basically said “take us to your leader.” I press the broadcast button again. “Command, this is Madison, contact has been made with the unknown vessel, they want an escort to Earth, how proceed?” For several minutes, I didn't get a response, then the same gruff voice from earlier responded. “Fly them to the coop and give them basic operating procedures, if they wanna talk, they'll need to know how to dock.” “Copy copy.”

1ko7spn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AajMaineJana/comments/1ko7spn/aaj_maine_jana_ki_if_you_struggle_with_sleep_do/,"aaj maine jana ki if you struggle with sleep, do this","I’ve struggled with sleep as long as I can remember and spent more time than I can admit trying to fix my sleep - listened to every podcast I could find (Huberman, Matthew Walker, etc), read books, even tested random advice from blogs & reddit lol. Sleep messes with everything you do and unless you have it sorted, youll never really feel like youre in control.

Now I'm at a place where I can fix my sleep whenever I want and I want to share all my learnings with you guys here. Not perfect ofcourse but my sleep is 10x better, I wake up fresher, and no longer feel like I need to drag myself through the day. Here's everything that helped me -

**1. Mornings are where the fix begins**

* Get bright light in your eyes within 30 minutes of waking up. That means balcony, terrace, or even just sitting by a window without sunglasses or cap. This one habit resets your internal clock.
* Delay chai or coffee for 90–120 minutes after waking. Sounds wrong, I know. But try it. It helps avoid the dreaded afternoon crash and keeps your energy more stable.
* Eat a real breakfast. Could be eggs, poha, oats, paratha with curd – doesn’t matter. Just don’t skip it. Eating early in the day helps set your circadian rhythm.
* Move your body a bit. Doesn’t need to be a workout. A walk, skipping, Surya Namaskar – anything that gets your body temperature up helps kickstart alertness.

**2. Afternoon = maintain, don’t ruin**

* Stop caffeine by 3 PM max. Your 5 PM chai is probably the reason you can’t fall asleep till 1 AM.
* Avoid naps. If you’re tired, search “Yoga Nidra” or “NSDR” on YouTube. These 10–20 minute sessions help reset your brain without screwing up night sleep.
* Get some sunlight again before sunset. Just 5–10 minutes. Evening light helps your body prepare for the transition into night.

**3. Evening is where the real game is**

* Eat dinner at least 3–4 hours before sleeping. Keep it lighter if possible. Add some carbs (roti, rice) – it actually helps you sleep better.
* Stop drinking water 1 hour before bed. Avoids midnight bathroom trips.
* Dim your lights after 8 PM. Overhead tube lights trick your brain into thinking it’s still daytime. Use warm lamps or night bulbs if possible.
* Avoid screens and stimulation 45 minutes before sleep. No Instagram loops, Netflix binging, or heavy convos. Keep your brain calm.
* Build a wind-down routine. Mine includes a warm shower, a bit of journaling, chamomile tea, and maybe a sleep story or meditation. Whatever relaxes you, do that consistently.

**4. Bedroom setup that made a difference**

* Keep the room cool. Fan or AC doesn’t matter — just make sure it’s not hot and stuffy.
* Stick one hand or foot out of the blanket — helps your body cool itself naturally.
* If noise is a problem, try earplugs or white noise. It really does help if you’re in a loud area.
* Keep the bed for sleeping only. Don’t use it for work, scrolling, or eating. Your brain starts to associate the bed with alertness if you do.

**5. What to do if your brain won’t shut up at night**

* Journaling helps. Just write down what’s on your mind.
* Chamomile tea, ashwagandha, or magnesium supplements (especially biglycinate) can calm the nervous system.
* Breathing exercises (like 4-7-8) or guided meditations (use apps like Insight Timer) help slow things down.
* Yoga Nidra or NSDR — amazing for calming down a racing mind.

**6. Extra stuff that helped me**

* Don’t miss your “sleepy window.” When you feel naturally drowsy, go to bed. Don’t push through it or you’ll be weirdly wide awake again.
* Set an alarm to start your sleep routine, not just for waking up. It’s easy to lose track at night.
* Sleep and wake up around the same time every day — even weekends. Otherwise, your body’s internal clock keeps resetting and you never stabilize.
* The 4 biggest signals for your sleep-wake cycle: light, movement, meals, and social interaction (especially early in the day). Anchor those and your body will follow.

**7. Supplements I tried (occasionally, not daily)**

* Magnesium (biglycinate or threonate)
* Chamomile tea or apigenin
* Ashwagandha
* Melatonin (only very occasionally — low dose)
* Myo-inositol + GABA + glycine (if I kept waking up in the middle of the night)

Happy to answer if you have any questions. I've also created an entire 30 minute video on this but if I share it here it will be removed for self-promotion lol so I just created this short summary of the pointers the video explains in detail. If mods allow I can share the video too but hopefully this helps someone :)

Edit: I remember I created a short cheatsheet on Notion if you guys find it useful - [https://wary-justice-a2f.notion.site/Rajat-s-Sleep-Hacking-Cheat-Sheet-16915f6ff96b801e9a1acf1599847229?pvs=74](https://wary-justice-a2f.notion.site/Rajat-s-Sleep-Hacking-Cheat-Sheet-16915f6ff96b801e9a1acf1599847229?pvs=74)",9,1747419269.0,AajMaineJana,3,0.84,False
