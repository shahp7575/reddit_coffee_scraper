So I technically don’t know if this is a friendship hang out or a date tomorrow. I actually wouldn’t mind at all if it were a friendship hang out because making new friends is always just as good as well. 

I’m kinda too scared too ask if it’s a date or not because I don’t want to make it awkward if it really is just a friendship hang out.

I think tomorrow I’m just going to treat it like a friendship hang out until proven otherwise . What would you guys do in this situation?",1,1746439960.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for someone cool, real, and down for some fun chats and meaningful conversations. 😎

A little about me:

* **Hobbies**: I’m really into music (I love everything from \[Indian music genres, eg. Carnatic, Bollywood\] to international artists like \[artist names you like\]), watching movies (huge fan of \[movie genre or specific movies like action, drama, or comedy\]), and traveling when I get the chance. Oh, and I also love cooking (I make a killer biryani 😏).
* **Personality**: I’m the type of person who loves to laugh and keep things light but can also get deep when the conversation calls for it. I’m the guy who’ll genuinely listen when you talk, and I love hearing different perspectives.
* **What I value**: I’m all about honesty, trust, and good vibes. I believe relationships work best when both people can be themselves and bring out the best in each other.

I’m looking for someone who:

* Is around my age (21-25).
* Shares some common interests (but if you’re different, I’m all for learning something new!).
* Knows how to have fun, whether it’s grabbing coffee, catching a movie, or just chilling and chatting.
* And most importantly, someone who’s looking for something real, even if it starts with just a friendship.

If you’re someone who values communication and laughs as much as I do, feel free to message me! 😊 Let’s see where this goes.

Looking forward to hearing from you! ✌️",1,1746439857.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

1kf7xfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1kf7xfz/day_7_getting_really_into_coffee_to_curb_cravings/,Day 7(?): Getting really into coffee to curb cravings.,"I am someone who thought I wouldn't quit nicotine (in my specific case, nicotine pouches like Zyn), let alone cold turkey. I started smoking then vaping in 2021, quit in 2023, and picked up nicotine pouches in 2023 to curb cravings from smoking or vaping. I did have plans to quit eventually, but my plan was to wean myself off, work my way down in milligrams of nicotine per pouch and the quantity I was having. However, that day came sooner than I thought. I'm out of money and people to ask for money to afford the habit. I'm between jobs, and other stuff comes first. It's been at least a week since I ran out. I usually last only max 2 days without something, and (mild gross warning)>!I would suck on the old pouches for the mouth feel.!<

While the internet says it's not ideal, I needed ways to help the cravings with something I already have that isn't high in sugar like candy (I have high insulin/ insulin resistance.) What did I have? Lots of coffee.

I'm not a regular coffee drinker, I see it as more of a dessert because of what I usually mix coffee with to tolerate it (I love the mocha frappe). However, I have drunk enough to tolerate the flavor it with a little cream and sugar alternative.

It's definitely not a *great* solution. I'm essentially exchanging one drug for another. The internet also says that you become more sensitive to caffeine and its effects when you quit. But I do not see myself ever quitting caffeine, at least way less likely than what I thought for nicotine.",1,1746439630.0,stopsmoking,0,0.99,False

Alright, friends, let’s get real for a second. Ever had one of those days where you think, “If I could just hit a button and automate my entire life, I’d be unstoppable!”? 🙌✨  

Seriously, what would it be? The laundry that refuses to just hop into the basket and clean itself? The endless emails that seem to multiply like rabbits? Or maybe it’s the dreaded grocery shopping that feels more like a game of “find the hidden vegetables”?  

Imagine this:  

- **Waking up and smelling fresh coffee,** without lifting a finger.  
- **Meals magically appearing** like it’s your own personal chef.  
- **Daily to-do lists auto-sorting themselves** based on priority. *Now that would be a dream, right?*  

For me, it would definitely be **meal prep**. I mean, who has the time to cook *every single day* when there are endless snacks to munch and Netflix shows to binge? Imagine stepping into the kitchen and BAM – perfectly cooked, prepped meals waiting for you. 🍽️✨  

Here are a few things I’d love to hear your thoughts on:  

1. **What’s that one task that takes up way too much of your time?**  
   - Is it keeping track of all those random subscriptions that seem to pop up out of nowhere?  

2. **What would you do with all that extra time?**  
   - More Netflix? Focus on a hobby? Start that side hustle you’ve been dreaming about?  

3. **Do you have any automation hacks that have changed your life?**  
   - Seriously, share the love! *We all need a little help in this busy world, right?*  

The beauty of life is that it’s chaotic and messy, but wouldn’t a little automation sprinkle some extra joy amid the chaos? We have the power to take one small chore off our plates and gain a little more freedom in our days.  

So, if you could only choose one thing to automate, what would it be?  Let’s throw our dreams into the ring, people! Who knows? Your next big idea might just spark a revolution in someone else’s life. Your life hack could be the next big break for another! 💡💖",1,1746439583.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Last week, everything felt mentally heavy. So I did something small: I decluttered my space and brought out my winter clothes. It wasn’t much, but it gave me a little sense of control again.

Today is my day off. I let myself rest — I slept in, did loads of laundry, cooked lunch, had a quiet coffee outside, painted my nails and played with my house owner’s dog. No rushing, no pressure. Just a slow, gentle day.

Life feels so loud and fast most of the time. But today reminded me that peace can come in small ways — in stillness, in movement, in doing something just for me.

I had early childhood trauma (sexually abused age 5) and parents with anger issues. I believe a have a anxious attachment style. I almost took my life 6 years ago which resulted in weekly therapy sessions that now are more spaced out. What I learned was healthy coping strategies, like regulating emotions and boundaries to myself and others and also stress/anger management. I met my partner who is likely avoidant attachment style when I was ca 19 and the relationship wasn't always good. Anytime I thought he would leave or so I tried to get attention by causing drama. I thought it was normal because it's what I learned from home. When I hit rock bottom and went to therapy I changed completely and I have apologized countless of times to my ex partner. Like deep from my heart at times when we where both together explaining how I see I treated him, that I'm sad about it and that I will do anything to make it better now. Well when I got better he developed a purchase addiction and spent huge amount of money on lavish things for himself. He blamed the addiction on me. I can see how I may have contributed to this which is why I did everything I could to get him the right help and support him getting better. I couldn't help him in the end he still had an addiction 4 years later and he was an expert lier and manipulated me constantly. We took therapy together and he lied also to the therapist. It meant we lived very small less than 40 sqm for many years while working full time with good jobs. The breakup was in December and I took help from my therapist splitting during a session. We now have sorted out our belongings and I own the apartment. I am seeing other men. The split was 3 months after I went through a major surgery which had me in bed for months not being able to walk. I have said to him that I think he should be able to date either - as it would be only fair as I couldn't. I didn't mean that he can't date it's none of my business and I also said that. Well now I'm dating some guys and he is going crazy. He comes to the apartment to just say hi be grab  coffee but ends up screaming, cursing me, telling me it was my fault he got into the addiction etc. I had to ask him to leave. Then he called in the night last two nights I think to check it I had company or not. I didn't. But he says he feel so low and have panic. Today he wrote he really need to spend time with me as a friend. I don't look forward to his visit. What should o do? ",1,1746438938.0,AskWomenOver30,1,1.0,False

I am looking to get an entry level setup at home as a complement to my regular filter machine. I am mostly looking to make Latte / Cappuccino / Macchiato and the occasional espresso shot (but probably 80% with some sort of milk). On average I would expect \~1 cup per day, b/c I'm mostly out. Hence also the the low-budget entry.

I was close on pulling the trigger on a new Bambino Plus (quick heating, easy milk handling) for \~430€. A friend's office has a Gaggia Classic Evo and is looking to sell it. It is \~2 years old, probably 10 shots per day pulled. Now the downside: it was pretty badly maintained, never really cleaned, probably also never properly descaled (mostly used hard tap water).

My questions: 1) Go for a new Bambino Plus or the Gaggia? 2) How much would you pay for such a machine considering the alternative new machine?

FYI, the budget in header disregards the grinder. I will probably start with something like a Baratza Encore ESP, Eureka Mignon or similar. But that's probably unrelated to the question at hand.

Thanks!

(WhatsApp Concept),"I've been thinking about how clunky it can sometimes be to keep track of expenses. It often feels like you need a separate app and a whole routine.

What if there was a really simple way to log your spending using something most of us already use every day – WhatsApp?

My basic idea is a system where you could:

* Quickly record expenses by sending a simple text message (e.g., ""₹250 coffee"").
* Maybe even send a photo of a receipt.
* Get a basic summary of your spending within the chat.

The goal is to make it as frictionless as possible for people who find traditional budgeting apps overwhelming.

What are your initial thoughts on this kind of approach? Do you see any potential benefits or major drawbacks? What would be the absolute must-have features for something like this to be useful for you?

My eyes stay wide, fixated on them like a dog watching a rabbit. Only the warriors are far more interesting, and as I watch them, I can't help but imagine myself amongst them, sparring and wrestling and fighting just as hard as any of them. 

That will never happen, of course. For one, I am a woman, and women are not allowed to train as warriors.  

And, I'm a runt.  

""Rhea,"" I turn as I hear a familiar voice, it's Ethel. ""You can't be out here. You're needed inside, there's a lot of stuff to do before the party and you gawking at those males isn't going to get anything done."" 

""I'm not gawking,"" I huff, following Ethel back towards the Alpha's packhouse. ""I'm watching."" 

""Well, watch something else. If Alpha Elias sees you, he'll be pissed, and I, for one, don't want to deal with his temper right now.""  

The packhouse was usually a quiet place, but today, it was a flurry of activity. Wolves were rushing around, cleaning, decorating, and preparing for the Alpha's birthday celebration tonight. 

The warriors, on the other hand, were training. Training like they did every day on the acres of ground that surrounded the packhouse. 

""Rhea,"" Ethel snaps again, this time sounding a bit too frustrated. ""Get your head out of the clouds. There's a lot of work. Get started with handling the flower arrangements. The florist delivered them a while ago. They are in the storage shed. Start arranging them and placing them."" 

""Yes, ma'am,"" I reply, trudging to the back of the packhouse where the storage rooms are. 

The storage rooms are usually dark and dusty, but today, they are brightly lit. I have never understood why we need so many storage sheds. But this is a packhouse and it is meant to accommodate the entire pack, so I guess having multiple storage facilities made sense. 

Just as I open the door, numerous smells of different flowers hit my nose. They are all neatly packed in boxes and baskets, wrapped with plastic and ribbons. 

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. I've never done this before. 

I pick up the first box, the weight is surprisingly heavy. I can smell the fragrance of lilies even through the wrapper. 

Slowly, I take out the delicate flowers and arrange them into a vases which I bring back into the packhouse and into the ballroom where the party is going to be hosted.  

It's the Alpha's 35th birthday tonight, and tenth year anniversary of the Blackfang Pack being under his ruling. It's a momentous event. A chance for everyone in the pack to come together and celebrate the Alpha's legacy and accomplishments. 

After I'm done arranging the flowers, I move on to the next task, which is setting out the champagne glasses that Ethel gives me. There are caterer's here who are handling the food, but the rest of it is on us.  

On Ethel. She's the housekeeper of the pack house, and under her, there are other staff members, including me. But for an event like this, we are certainly short staffed. There are going to be a hundred's of people coming here and we nearly don't have enough hands to handle the work. 

Several other pack Alphas are going to be here, including some high ranking warriors. Ethel has been running around like a chicken with its head cut off, and I really can't blame her. 

I'm just glad that I'm not the one in charge. 

""Rhea!"" 

I hear her voice, and it makes me jump a little. 

""Yes, ma'am?"" 

""Put these on the table,"" Ethel thrusts several glass sculptures at me. 

""These?"" 

""Yes, and make it quick."" 

I do as I'm told and place the statues carefully on the table. They are beautiful, I'm almost afraid that I'll break them. 

The ballroom is almost ready, and the guests will be arriving soon. Everything has to be perfect, and if it's not, Ethel is going to flip. 

I've already seen her going off on the catering staff once today. 

The skies begin to darken as more time passes by. The celebration begins at eight in the evening and it's expected to end by midnight, or later. These things often ended quite late. Which means, I was probably not going to go home until late. I don't really mind it. There's nothing much for me to do at home except for watch my brother, Luke, practice his fighting skills on me, and listen to him brag about how great he is. 

""Okay, I think we're all set,"" Ethel claps her hands as she looks around the room. 

The music is playing, and the food is laid out. The room is filled with flowers and candles, and everything looks perfect. Now, we just have to wait for the guests to arrive. 

It's not my job to greet the guests, but I'm definitely curious to see who's going to show up. 

I know for one that my parents are going to be here, but thankfully, they don't have to see me as I will be working in the kitchen and handling matters in the back for the rest of the night.  

That is the initial plan.  

Until Ethel comes up to me. ""There's a change of plans."" 

""Change of plans?"" I look at her curiously. ""What do you mean by that?"" 

She hands me a uniform which is quite similar to what the other catering and serving girls are wearing. ""You're going to be working in the ballroom. We need more servers. There are going to be alot of people here.""  

""But—"" 

""No buts.""  

""I don't think people want to be served by me."" I point out the fact that I'm nothing but a runt and I doubt the people that are coming here want to even smell one.  

Runts were killed everywhere across the world. I was only spared because of Alpha Elias. I can't imagine why Ethel would think that there would be anyone who would want me serving them. 

Ethel snickers, ""I'm sure no one is going to care. Besides, I'm not asking you, I'm ordering you. And you don't have a choice. We're short on staff."" 

I lower my gaze on the uniform she has given me and then look back up at her. ""Okay.""  

""Great. Go change in the back. Quickly and before the guests start coming in. It's already getting dark. They are going to be here any moment."" she pats my arm twice before turning around and heading into the another direction.  

I sigh in disbelief and take the clothes she has given me into the washroom that's behind the ballroom. It takes me a minute to change and once I'm done, I glance at the mirror to see how the clothes fit me. They are as loose as they can possibly be.  

The skirt hangs so low below my knees and the shirt is so big on me that it's almost as if I'm wearing a blanket. But there's nothing I can do about it so I simply take it in and head out of the washroom, back to the ballroom where the guests are starting to arrive. 

I keep my head low, not wanting to catch the attention of anyone as I move through the crowd. It's amazing to see the number of powerful and influential wolves that are coming to the party. I see plenty of Alpha's here with their entourages and their mates. 

I'm still stunned as I look at all of them. They are all dressed to the teeth, wearing their finest clothes and jewels, and looking as if they have never done a day of work in their lives. 

A live orchestra is playing in the background as more and more people come inside from the front. It's completely dark outside and the full moon is high in the sky. 

I serve as much champagne I can, to whoever wants it while keeping an eye out for Mom and Dad. They are going to come here and I want them to see me doing something worthwhile. 

My family matters the most to me, they are everything I have and I'm alive because of them. But they hadn't come around to accept me, especially my Dad. He hasn't spoken to me in four years, four long years and no matter how hard I try, he won't talk to me. 

It's not because of anything I did, it's because of who I am. I had been born a runt, a runt amongst many things, but I don't choose to be. I want to be a warrior, like my dad, like my brother, and like my uncles, but there's no chance I can become one. Runts don't become anything but a burden. 

""What are you doing here?"" I hear another familiar voice and this time, I turn around much faster after knowing it's my Mom. ""I thought you weren't going to be here at the party."" 

""I wasn't—I was supposed to work in the kitchen, but Ethel—"" 

She cut me off before I could finish. ""Well, don't let your father see you here. Especially like this. He's going to get angry and then he's going to leave.""  

""Mom, there's nothing I can do."" I explain to her. 

""You can do something, you can go into the kitchen and stay away from the people. Or better yet, go home early and stay in your room."" I can already head the hatred in her voice, it's so loud even when she speaks so softly.  

My heart drops a little but I don't say anything. 

""Please."" 

# Chapter 2

Chapter 2 

Rhea  

I stay by the sidelines for the most part of the evening, avoiding my Dad and Mom. Wherever they go, I move to the opposite. There are some people in the party that give me an odd look when they realize that I'm a runt but they don't say anything to me. 

Maybe because I'm serving them champagne and they are a bit drunk. 

I'm not sure, but I'm glad they don't say anything. 

The party is going well and as the night goes on, people become more and more intoxicated. They are laughing and dancing and having a great time. Alpha Elias joins in as well and goes around the room. People celebrate him and toast to his health and long life. 

He's been a great Alpha and I hope he will continue to lead the pack for a long time. But, as the hours tick by, I just want to go home. I've been on my feet for the entire evening, and my legs are getting tired and I'm tired of getting those strange looks from the guests. 

Things take a turn when I see my Dad from the corner of my eyes. He's talking to someone and I'm not quite sure who it is. But before he notices me, I take a turn and make a run for the other side of the ballroom.  

But as I run, I bump into someone and the champagne in my hands spill all over me and the glasses fall onto the ground. My heart skips a beat, a tragic beat. 

""I'm sorry,"" I blurt out quickly, and pick up the glasses. 

But as I look up, I find myself staring into the darkest eyes I have ever seen. They are not filled with anger, yet they are not filled with kindness. They are simply...empty. 

No.  

It can't be. 

But it is. 

""I'm sorry,"" I mutter again, stepping back, away from him. 

But he steps closer, his eyes never leaving my face. His gaze is intense, as if he's trying to read my mind, as if he's trying to see into my soul. I can't help but shiver slightly. Something about him makes my hair stand on end, something about him makes me want to run away, to hide. 

I can't, though. 

I take another step back. I need to leave, I need to go anywhere—anywhere from him, from this person. I turn around, and before I can take another step, I hear his deep, husky voice. 

""Stop."" 

I freeze, my blood running cold. The music, the voices, the laughter — everything fades away. All I can hear is his voice, all I can feel is his presence, looming, threatening. I slowly turn around, my eyes darting around the room, looking for a way out. 

I can't let him catch me, I can't let him touch me, I can't let him do anything to me. 

My eyes land on Ethel, who is standing near the entrance of the ballroom. She looks surprised, confused even, but she doesn't say anything. 

Everyone else is still occupied in whatever they are doing. Barely anyone glances here except for the wolf I bumped into. I want to leave. God, I should've been in the kitchen. I should've fought harder to stay in the back than working in the ballroom itself.  

His eyes are still fixed on mine, his lips parted, as if he wants to say something. But he doesn't. He just stares at me, his expression unreadable. 

I swallow hard, my hands trembling, and my legs feeling weak. I can't breathe, I can't speak, I can't even move. 

""I'm sorry,"" I apologize to him for the third time. ""It was a mistake.""  

Ethel comes rushing to me, saving me from the catastrophe that I'm in. ""It's okay,"" she says to the man. ""I'll get this cleaned up. I'm sorry about that. It won't happen again. Please, enjoy the rest of the evening and excuse us."" 

The wolf doesn't stops looking at me even when Ethel is talking to him. My chest rises and drops. I don't know what to do. I just want to get out of here. I need to. With Ethel in between, I take my chance and dash out of the ballroom, to the back washrooms to clean up myself and all the champagne that has spilled on me. 

I wait for a few minutes, leaning against the wall, waiting for my heart to stop beating so fast.  

I know the wolf—everyone knows him.  

Alpha Aron of the BloodClaw Pack, a strong Alpha, a powerful wolf, and the most dangerous one of all. 

He is known to be ruthless, cruel, and merciless. 

I had seen him only a few times, in photos. He rarely left his territory and when he did, it was for important matters. But never did I think that he would come to our pack's celebration, never did I think that I would be in the same room as him. 

Seeing him here, in the flesh, has me shaking with fear. It's like all the bells in my head are ringing, warning me to run, to flee. But I can't. I'm rooted to the spot, my heart beating so fast that I'm afraid it's going to explode. 

He can't be my mate.  

No.  

There has to be some kind of mistake.  

My wolf is silent, not responding even when I call out to her. She's afraid. We're afraid. This can't be happening. How can it? I'm a runt and the chance of having a mate is low, but the minute I stumbled into him with the glasses of champagne, I felt it in my bones right away.  

It was like a jolt went through my body when I looked into his eyes. 

I try to calm myself down, breathing in and out slowly. It's not working. My mind is racing, and my heart is still pounding wildly in my chest. I close my eyes, trying to block out the image of his face, but it's no use. Every time I shut my eyelids, it's like I can see him even more clearly. 

No.  

It can't be.  

The door behind me bursts open, making me jump. My heart races, and I grip the edge of the sink, struggling to catch my breath. 

He's here. 

I don't even need to look at him to know that it's him. 

His scent is so strong, so masculine, so...Alpha. 

He steps inside and closes the door behind, and the thud of the door tells me everything that I need to know. That I'm doomed.  

# Chapter 3

Chapter 3 

Rhea  

My back presses against the marble sink, my hands gripping the cool surface as I try to steady myself. There's nowhere to go, nowhere to run. 

The bathroom is small and cramped, with barely enough room for two people. 

And he's standing right in front of me, his eyes staring down at me, his face so close to mine that I can feel his breath on my cheeks. 

""What are you doing here?"" I ask, my voice trembling. 

""You are my mate."" His voice is deep, husky, and a bit raspy. 

I swallow hard, unable to tear my eyes away from him. His scent fills the air, making my head spin. 

""No,"" I shake my head vigorously, my hands shaking. ""You're wrong."" 

""I'm not,"" he says. ""Your scent."" 

""I don't know what you're talking about."" 

He reaches out and grabs my wrist in his hand, his touch burning against my skin. A chill runs down my spine, and I try to pull away, but he holds on tight, his grip unyielding. I can't break free. 

""You're my mate,"" he repeats, like I haven't heard him the first time.  

""Please,"" I beg, ""let me go."" 

He releases my wrist, but I remain stuck where I'm standing. My feet don't move, I don't think they can anymore. He's looking at me with those soulless eyes that seem to suck the very life out of me. 

""I know that you are my mate, and I know that you know it as well. There's no point in denying it. Your scent...it's unlike any other. It calls to me, it calls to my wolf."" 

""I don't know what you are talking about,"" I deny it again even though I know it's not true. 

I feel it. 

Every part of me feels it and so does my wolf. But it just can't be. It's something I cannot accept, but the truth is right there and it's staring me straight in the face. 

""You're lying to me."" 

I turn my head to the side, avoiding his gaze. I'm scared, I'm terrified, but I refuse to show him that. If I do, he will only use it against me. 

""I have—I have things to do. Please. I need to go back to the party before someone sees me missing."" 

""You're afraid."" His voice is low and full of mocking, his tone indicating that he's not the least bit concerned by my distress. 

""Of course, I'm afraid. You're a complete stranger to me and you've cornered me in a confined space with no way to escape. Why wouldn't I be afraid?"" My voice is growing louder and angrier, my frustration and fear manifesting itself in my words. ""Let me go."" 

""I will,"" he replies simply. ""As soon as you admit that you are my mate."" 

""I'm not your mate,"" I say. ""I can't be."" 

""Why not?"" 

""Because—because you're an Alpha, and I'm a runt."" 

""So?"" 

""So, it's not possible."" 

""It is—"" 

There's more that's about to leave his lips, but we are interrupted by Ethel. I release a breath as she finds me inside the washroom. There's confusion on her face as she sees me with the Alpha of another pack, a powerful one at that, and she doesn't quite know what to say. 

""Is everything okay?"" She asks, her voice cautious. 

""We're just fine,"" The Alpha replies before I can get any words out. He looks at me and then steps back. When there's some distance, I finally feel like my legs can work. ""I was just leaving. Excuse me."" 

He leaves the washroom without another word and I'm grateful for it. His quick departure and silence tells me that he doesn't wants anyone to know which only gives me more indication that I need to keep this to myself and I need to keep denying it. 

A moment passes and Ethel closes the door behind her before looking at me. The look on her face tells me that she has a million questions for me. 

""What was he doing in here?"" she asks, her voice low. ""And why are you so out of breath? What is wrong with you today?""  

""Nothing. I—I just came here to clean up and I think he followed me.""  

""Why?""  

""I don't know."" I shrug, acting as if I'm clueless. 

But Ethel knows better. 

""I think you do know."" Ethel narrows her eyes at me. ""Did you—were you planning on doing something?""  

""What?""  

""I can see the appeal in the wanting to be with someone strong and powerful, but you're no one, Rhea. You're a runt and men like these will rip your head off and throw it in the trash. Don't even think about it for a moment."" She goes on and on.  

It takes me a minute to understand what she's implying on and the minute I do, I'm disgusted. She thinks that I lured the Alpha of the BloodClaw Pack into the bathroom and was doing god knows what. 

""It's nothing like that. I just came here to clean up myself, and he followed me in for I don't know what,"" I tell her again, defending myself over and over again. ""You've to believe. I had no ill intentions, I'm not like that, I would never."" 

Ethel sighs and nod, taking my word. ""For your own sake, I think you should go home. The party is wrapping up anyway and I'll get the others to take care of everything else."" 

""Thank you. I'm sorry about making a mess and—"" 

""It's fine. Just go home and rest."" She waves a hand, dismissing me. ""Go on, go."" 

I gather myself and leave the washroom after that. I change out of the uniform that Ethel gave me and then leave the packhouse without another word. The grounds outside are still well-lit and there are a few people standing around, talking and drinking. 

When I pass by them, they turn and look at me, their eyes following my every move. I can't help but feel self-conscious, and I walk faster, wanting to get away from their judgmental stares. 

I make my way to the gates of the pack house and walk home from there alone. It's not too far so I don't mind the walk. But I can't stop thinking about everything that just happened. 

I have a mate. 

I have a mate and he is Alpha Aron of the BloodClaw Pack. 

# Chapter 4

Chapter 4 

Rhea  

I barely get a wink of sleep after returning to my home, my mind replaying everything that has happened, and the interaction I had with the Alpha of another pack. 

When the sun rises, I force myself off the bed and straight into the shower. As the hot water beats down on my body, I close my eyes, trying to clear my mind of all the thoughts that are troubling me. 

But I can't.  

Mates are special, and not something that can be denied. It's a bond that is meant to be cherished and celebrated, and yet, that is the last thing I want to do. Never through my whole life did I ever imagined being someone's mate. As a runt, I didn't think it was possible.  

The universe is punishing me for my existence and has found a way to give me the most dangerous wolf in the entire world as a mate. 

But why?  

I never wanted one.  

A tear lands on my cheek as I slip on my clothes and prepare for the day. There's a swelling in my heart, a deep ache that I can't explain. But for some reason, I try to convince myself that I can ignore it. 

The night is over, the party is over and the people that were there are gone, including my mate. He's an Alpha of a pack, he has to return to it, and he has more pressing matters than to be with me. 

I'm sure he'll forget about me in time. Especially since he doesn't even knows my name. 

If I ignore it, I know it will go away. And then, everything will go back to the way it was before. I'll still be a runt, and no one will care about me. I won't have a mate, and I won't have to worry about anything ever again. 

It's a nice thought, and for a moment, I allow myself to indulge in it. 

Until Luke knocks me down from the stairs as I'm about to head into the kitchen to prepare breakfast for my family. My arm hits the floor, and I let out a yelp of pain. 

""Watch where you're going, idiot,"" he says, his voice filled with contempt. ""Do you even know how to use your eyes?"" 

I glance up at him, and my heart sinks when I see the look on his face. Anger, disgust, and disappointment. There's no sympathy or concern, no hint of compassion or empathy. He just sees me as an inconvenience, a burden that he wishes he didn't have to deal with. 

He rolls his eyes before walking away from me. He's two years younger than me, but he already towers over me. 

My mom walks out of her room and sees me. I quickly get up on my feet before she sees me on the floor. I don't need any more embarrassment and a scolding from her. 

""I don't even want to know."" My mother sighs. 

I go in the kitchen and start preparing the food. There are only four of us in the house. Sometimes, Aunt Lydia comes to stay with us but she's in another country right now so there's slightly less food to prepare.  

After I finish, I take my breakfast up stairs and stay in my room until it's time for me to go to work, which is usually around ten. 

As I get out of my house, the bright sunlight stings my eyes, and I blink a few times, trying to adjust to the glare. I'm still sleepy and tired, and I want nothing more than to crawl back into bed and hide under the covers but taking a day off from work is like asking for trouble. 

Alpha Elias doesn't tolerate absenteeism. If you're not at your post when you're supposed to, you can get fired. And if you get fired, you're out on the streets. Especially me.  

Ethel can be lenient sometimes, she'll let me take longer breaks if I'm sick or if there's something wrong, but the Alpha is not. His demands are clear and unforgiving. 

Twenty minutes later and I'm walking in through the gates of the packhouse. The land surrounding the house is huge and green. The main house is a massive, white mansion that sits atop a hill. It's surrounded by acres of sprawling lawns and gardens where the warriors do their trainings.  

When I reach inside the house, I go straight to the kitchen's in the back where I find Ethel.  

She appears exhausted.  

""Something I can help you with?"" I ask her, ready to do whatever she needs. 

""There's a lot of work here today, Rhea. The party lasted longer than it should've. I've put the other girls on the clean up duty of the ballroom. But breakfast is getting late.""  

I look around the kitchen where the cooks are preparing the meals. It seems like they are almost done with it. 

""Should I call everyone for their meals?"" I ask her.  

""No. I've already send Tony to take care of that,"" she shakes her head. ""But I need someone to deliver that to the Alpha's office. I would go but my legs are tired from climbing up those stairs all night and morning.""  

""I'll take it.""  

I glance at the neatly placed tray in the corner of the kitchen. It's an arrangement of fruit, bread and coffee. It's an extra plate, just like Ethel always sends to the Alpha. It's a regular routine of him not eating breakfast until his morning coffee is served one by the housekeeper, and Ethel fulfils that role perfectly. 

""Okay. Come back down right away. There are some things I need to go through with you today."" 

""All right."" 

I pick up the tray and make my way towards the Alpha's office. It's located on the third floor of the pack house. The first floor is reserved for the guests, and the rooms in the back are for the staff. Some high ranking pack wolves reside at the second floor. And the third floor is reserved exclusively for the Alpha and his close family members. 

The stairs leading to the third floor are guarded by two big burly men, both warriors. When I arrive there, they simply nod at me and let me pass. They've seen me going up and down these stairs a thousand times before. 

I take a deep breath before reaching the office where the door is shut. 

There aren't many encounters that I have with the Alpha. Most of the time, I see him from a distance, and Ethel barely chooses to send me to him. But, whenever I'm summoned, I make sure that I'm not the least bit out of line and I always do what I'm told.  

It is under his orders that I'm alive today, and I'll always be grateful for that. 

I knock twice on the door. 

""Come in."" 

I open the door and walk in, my eyes cast downwards until I catch a whiff of his scent. It's only then that I raise my gaze and my eyes meet his. 

He supposed to be gone, long ago. The night's over, the party's over. All the guests that arrived are meant to be gone and so is he. 

But he's not. 

He's here.  

What is he doing here? What is he doing sitting in the chair across the desk? Why is he here?  ",1,1746438711.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

We've always been close and have had a really good relationship. His girlfriend (she's 18) came into his life about a year ago, and since then I've noticed he's changed a lot. She constantly jokes about how clumsy he is or “can't do anything without her”, but it doesn't seem like a joke and he's really starting to believe it. If he wants to go out with me and our company, she suddenly starts getting sick or making a scene for him to stay home. I've tried to hint to him a couple times that it doesn't look quite ok, but he waves it off. Last week he and I were having coffee and he started complaining that she had forbidden him to go fishing with us for the weekend because she would be bored alone. I couldn't take it anymore and said bluntly ""Look, I think she's manipulating you. It's become like you're not you, she's controlling you."" He laughed at first, but then started defending her, and by the end of the night he actually said I was overreacting and he needed to think about our friendship. Now he's not responding to messages and mutual friends say he's offended. I realize I may have said too much, but I'm really worried about him. On the other hand, it's his life, and I probably shouldn't have gotten involved. But I couldn't keep quiet either, it's like watching your friend drown and not throwing him a life preserver.

1kf7na4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1kf7na4/i_am_looking_for_novel_after_a_onenight_stand_i/,"I am looking for novel After a one-night stand, I had three kids","This is my first trip back to the U.S. since getting my dream job. I have a couple of days to catch up with my friends and relax before I have to head back to Paris and the first thing I did was get a front-row ticket to the Strikers tour to see Toxic Rose Thorns—my favorite band of all time.

It's not the first time I see them. I went a few times before they blew up when I was in college. This is my first time seeing them this close and I am excited. The tickets had been sold out for weeks but my super, amazingly beautiful, cutthroat boss pulled some strings to help me get a ticket. It was probably the very last one of its kind and here I am. Inches away from kissing the damn stage anxiously excited and waiting for this crappy opening band to get done.

That's not fair. They're actually not that bad.

I glance back to see that the arena is most definitely sold out. The sea of people are watching the show, dancing, and moshing to the sweet screeching of the second band playing. I take a couple of pictures and make sure to get the name on the banner so that I can check out their music with a little less chaos later.

This is the first show I come to alone, but I don't feel alone. The swarm of people in the pit is energetic. None of us are strangers at the moment. We're all the best of friends as we wait for our favorite band to come out and bless us with their metalcore glory.

""I love your outfit!"" one of the girls leaning on the rails catches my attention. ""Where did you get it?""

""I made it,"" I laugh. ""I love your T-shirt. I have one from their first show at the House of Blues,""

""Yes!"" she wraps her arms around me. ""Did you go?""

""Yeah, it was my twenty-first birthday,"" I nod.

""Oh, my god. I was there too. With my Ex,"" she rolls her eyes. ""He's the one that introduced me to this,""

""That's crazy. My Ex introduced me too,"" I laugh.

""His name wasn't Connor was it?""

""No,"" I shake my head. ""His name was Jose,""

""Ugh,"" we both laugh. ""This is my friend Naty. I'm Jesse,""

""Phoebe,"" I shake their hands.

""I've never met a Phoebe before,"" her friend screams. ""We have to take a picture,""

""Okay,"" I laugh.

""TRT on three,"" she shouts holding her phone up. ""One. Two. Three!""

The three of us shout TRT and she snaps four or five pictures at once.

""What's your Quick Howl?"" Jesse asks.

""CT\_OFPhoebs98,"" I say and she types it into her phone. She looks up at me confused.

""This is you?"" she asks holding her phone up.

""Yeah,""

""You're verified. You have four million followers,""

""I work for Royal Threads. I'm a designer,"" I laugh. They both scream.

""Oh, my god! I love their new pink Academia collection. Holy shit,"" Naty screams. ""I work for Gossip Daily. I'm a reporter,""

""I'm in the music industry,"" Jesse says. My phone buzzes in my pocket. I see that the two of them are now following me and that they've tagged me in a picture.

The sound of Knightly Blake's guitar blasts from the speakers and our conversation is instantly forgotten. The crowd erupts into screams as the curtain is raised to reveal the black lights and purple lasers.

My heart skips when he stops at the edge of the stage with his favorite baby blue guitar right in front of us. My scream is stuck in my throat as he leans forward to speak into the mic. The entire show goes on in a blur of screaming and singing along. It ends way too soon leaving my body buzzing and wanting more.

By the time I got back to my rental, I remembered that I had spoken to those girls and laugh at myself because I didn't even get their numbers. I sit here for a bit and then wait to get out of the crowded parking lot.

I stop to get some tacos and drinks before heading back to the BnB I'll be staying in until the end of the month before I get back to work. Coincidentally, it wasn't too far from the venue. I probably would have walked if I wasn't a complete chicken and kind of afraid of the dark. It took me a lot longer to get here than I expected. I grab my food and my new TRT merch to head up.

As I'm rounding the lobby to get to the elevators someone smacks right into me. I drop some of my things but not my food.

""Yes, I didn't drop my tacos,"" I laugh and reach down to grab the sweater on the floor.

""I am so sorry,"" the guy says and reaches for my things. ""I was on my phone,""

""It's okay. It happens,"" I say.

We both look up at the same time and I freeze. My stupid mouth falls open when my gaze clashes with his gorgeous jade-green eyes. He looks down at the sweater and the vinyl.

""No,"" he laughs. ""Are you just getting back from my show?""

I open my mouth and all that comes out is a squeak. That's Knightly fucking Blake. I touched his boots on stage earlier tonight. That's how close I was to him and now he's kneeling in front of me holding my stuff.

""Are you still breathing?"" he waves his hand in my face.

""Holy fuck. Dude! You're Knightly Blake,"" bursts out of my mouth loud enough for it to echo in the lobby's high ceilings.

""You're lucky there's not one here,"" he laughs. ""Are you okay?""

""Yeah, I didn't drop my tacos,"" I say and let him help me stand up.

""We wouldn't want that,"" he says putting my things together.

""I am so sorry. I didn't mean to scream in your face like that,"" I apologize.

""It happens,"" he grins looking me over. ""Where did you get my suit from last year's tour?""

""I made it. It's been my favorite costume since the suspenders. Um, I don't think I would been allowed into the venue if I had showed up in that,"" why did I say that? What the fuck is wrong with me?

""That's too bad. I bet you'd look amazing in it,"" he one-shoulder shrugs. I burst into laughter.

""That was kind of cringe,"" I admit.

""Why are you so red?"" he laughs.

""I just got hit on by Knightly Blake,"" I shake my head in disbelief. ""Would it be weird if I asked for a picture?""

""Not at all,"" he presses his lips together.

Is he blushing? Get the fuck out of here. I quickly set my things down and take my phone out of my back pocket.

""I am red,"" I laugh holding up my phone. ""It's cool. I'll edit it later. Ready?""

""Waiting on you,"" he grins. I snap our picture and show him. ""That's a good one. Be sure to tag me in that,""

""Okay,"" I agree and look up at him. He towers over me by at least six inches without my usual stilettos. He makes me feel small and I am not a small person.

""You and your friends were standing up front tonight. I almost stepped on your hand,"" he looks down at my things.

""You saw that? I would have been honored to have been stepped on by you,"" what the fuck?

""Is that right?"" he laughs and I feel my face heat up even more.

""There now we both said something stupid,"" I try to hide my embarrassment. We both laugh.

""You're not stalking us are you?"" he asks.

""No, I'm staying here,"" I shake my head and bend down to pick my things up again. He helps me and hands everything back. The elevator pings open and an old couple walks out with their little ugly dog. We both get into the elevator. I reach for the buttons at the same time he does and we both click the fourth floor. ""You gotta be fucking kidding me,""

""That is exactly what I was thinking,"" he laughs and turns his head slightly to look at me. We're about half an inch away from each other. ""You're not going to hit me if I kiss, are you?""

""My hands are full,"" I remind him.

""Right. You don't want to drop your tacos,"" he says. I step back until my back hits the mirrored wall behind me and suddenly his lips are on mine.

My first instinct is to run. It usually is, but when he steps closer burying his hand in my hair. I have no choice but to give in. He feels it the moment I do because his tongue sweeps my lips and I don't hesitate to let him take control of it. My skin comes alive when he touches me. The elevator pings and he pulls away without letting go of me.

""Oh, my god,"" I squeak making him grin.

""I'm sharing a room with two others,""

""There's no one at my place,"" I say without hesitation.

""Lead the way,"" he takes a step back.

My ears ring as I step out of the elevator. I glance back at him to make sure this is real. Am I really going to do this? I can think of several reasons why I shouldn't and almost all of them end up with me dead and or kidnapped. I stop in front of my door.

""My card is in my back pocket,"" I say.

The sly grin that crosses his face is enough to say fuck it. If this is the hill I die on, this is where it ends. His fingertips trail up the back of my thigh before he reaches into my pocket and slips out the key card. His eyes meet mine and he holds my stare as he swipes it through the reader.

""There you go,"" he says lowly. I lick my lips tasting his minty sweetness.

""Thank you,"" I fight the urge to laugh again because why the fuck did I just thank him? We walk inside and I immediately go over to the dining table to set everything down. ""There's a mess. I'm here for work,""

""You're an artist?"" he asks looking over my sketches and open portfolios.

""I'm a clothes designer,"" I say reaching for the Redd's Apple Ale I got earlier. ""Would you like a drink?""

""Sure,"" he says coming over to me.

I slide the box over to him and he takes one. He doesn't even look at what it is I provided for him. We both open the bottle and take a drink completely in sync. This is a dream. It has to be. His was more of a sip. He sets it down and reaches for my waist. When he positions himself in front of me he takes the bottle out of my hand.

""I've never done this,"" I admit.

""You're a virgin?"" he searches my face.

""No, no. I mean the one-night stand thing,"" I laugh nervously.

""I'll guide you through it,""

I gasp when his fingers dig into my thighs and then he lifts me onto the table. His mouth is on me again and this time, I have nothing in my hands to stop me from touching him. Holy shit! This is happening to me right now.

My hands are all over him and if he has a problem with it, he doesn't complain. His body is firm but not in a crazy buff kind of way. My shirt goes first and then my bra. His teeth graze my neck as he gently pushes me back to get to my bare breasts. The sound that comes out of me makes him grin as he bites down on the outside of my boob. The sting only serves to wake me up more. I pull his shirt over his head and toss it.

There is ink all over the place. I know some of these from when I was younger and had nothing better to do than obsess over him and the other members of the band. I can't believe I'm seeing them up close and personal. I touch them, trace them up his arm and onto his neck as he continues to palm my breasts and bite on them.

""Fuck, you're beautiful,"" he says unbuttoning my jeans. He lifts me a little to pull them down my thighs. He sets me down and takes them off along with my boots. ""You wore this to see me perform tonight?"" I can't bring myself to say anything so I just nod. ""These are not good girl panties,""

""You don't get to decide that,"" I laugh. ""But you can take them off,""

""I much rather leave them where they are,"" he grins. ""Lay back on the table,""

His hand presses down on my belly and I do as he asks. He smiles and tugs the fabric of my thong to the side. His fingers gently caress me. I squeak again when he rubs me in a circular motion. I lay back on the table when he slips his middle finger inside of me.

""That's it,"" he praises. ""Relax for me,""

""My name is Pheobe,"" I inform him.

""It is a pleasure to meet your acquaintance, Pheobe,"" he grins looking up at me. ""You can call me Knight,""

""Okay,"" I lay back. ""Knight,""

He slips his finger out of me, tucking his hands under me to lift me off the table. He buries his face between my legs and all I can do is hold on for dear life. Just like the show, everything happens in a blur.

It happens here on the table with my legs wrapped around him as our tongues get more than a little acquainted with one another. He starts off slow and I'm grateful for it because just like the rest of him. Knightly Blake is blessed by all the fucking gods in the universe. It's honestly not fair to any man on this earth.

The next thing I know, I bent over the table with his hand coming down on my ass making loud slaps while he keeps praising me and calling me his good girl. We stumble into the living room where he curls me up on the couch to successfully trap me under him in every position he can think of. I didn't know I could bend in some of the positions he put me in.

We end up in the shower and finally spend the rest of the night in the room until I fall asleep. I am deliciously sore all over when I wake up the next morning. He's nowhere in sight and at the moment, I think it's for the best.

I get up and find the vinyl I bought last night on the kitchen counter. It's signed by every member of the band and at the bottom where his signature is in silver marker reads. Don't worry Pheobe. To me, you're always going to be my good girl. Our little secret. Knight.

Thinking back on that night, despite how everything turned out in the end, I'll never bring myself to regret the choice I made. Before then, my life had been empty and he gave me the greatest gift I could have ever asked for. Well, gifts. Two of them with the same pretty jade green eyes. Aizen and Ayrie. The two little whoopsies I discovered growing inside of me in Paris, two months later.

Gone was the reckless little girl I was after freeing myself from my father's clutches. Things became clearer. The goal wasn't to prove to my dad that I could more than make it out on my own without him. It was all for them. They really put things into perspective for me and it was all because of that night. I didn't think he'd be who he became as he was when he found out he was a father and that I never had the intention of ever letting him know. Fate somehow favored me and I will forever be grateful for KNIGHTLY.

Six Years Later

Every time I get called into the school, the French headmistress calls me a filthy American bitch and I laugh at her because even if that is true, I pay her enough for her to overlook what my son has done yet again. God, I miss when that meant something.

Aizen is a biter.

I could ask where the kid got it from but the day after his conception tells me he got it from his father. The mother of the little boy my son tried to take a chunk out of, is livid. With good reason, but while Aizen's attack preference is biting, I have to ask what the kid did to get him there. Because he doesn't do it without reason. Ayrie loves to tease him and while she can get carried away, her brother has the patience of a saint, bless his soul. So, I doubt he did it without provocation.

The French mother is shouting all kinds of French vulgarities at me. Usually, people think I don't understand them, but I've been here for eight years of my life and I took French before moving here. I'm not here on a whim but to each their own. And of course, the first thing I learned to do was how to call someone a fucking asshole in French. It's, putain de trou du cul. It actually sounds really cool.

The headmistress glances over at me every so often to make sure I'm not taking offense to the shit coming out of this woman's mouth. I am so glad to be going home after all this time. When I first arrived, I was so excited. Because hello, Paris. Except the people here are mean and they smoke. Like a lot. I might miss the late morning work start, but the rest of it can go to shit for all I care. I've been to New York and that has nothing on this place. New York is just a bunch of aggressive sweeties. I'm glancing at you, Queens.

""What did he do to him?"" I finally cut in.

""He bit my son,"" she shouts in her dumb French accent.

""If you don't back up, French fry. I'll be biting you next,"" I sneer. She places her hand over her chest as if offended. As if she didn't just curse my son up, down, and sideways.

""There was a small altercation between Milos and Aizen over a lunch bag,"" the headmistress places my son's Bluey lunch bag on the desk.

""That's my son's. I packed it for him this morning. He doesn't like the food here,"" I open it to show her where I stitched his name tag.

""We serve only the best here,"" she scoffs. That's not the fucking point, lady.

""Try telling that to my five-year-old,"" I roll my eyes because that's not the fucking point, lady.

""American scum,"" the woman makes a spitting sound in my direction.

""Lady, you are lucky that our sons are here because I would love nothing more than to slam your stupid face into that desk,"" I say lowly so only she can hear me. ""Your son put his filthy hands on my son's belongings. It better not happen again,"" I snatch the bag off the desk. ""Do you understand?"" I repeat it to her in French and her entire demeanor falls apart. ""You seem to have gotten that one,""

""You're going to let her speak to me like that? I pay good money for my son to come here-""

""So do I. I have two kids here,"" I scoff. ""And I'm on the committee,""

""You have two children?"" she glares at me.

""Are we done?"" I ask the headmistress.

""I am sorry, Miss Altaha,"" she apologizes. ""Is there anything I can do for you while you're here?""

Her tone makes me wish I wasn't a strong, independent, and educated woman back on my reservation in California. There's only a week left. I don't need this shit and neither do the twins.

""You can bring my daughter out and I'd like their transcripts, please,"" I nod. She tenses up and looks between me and the woman next to me.

""Miss Altaha, I will see to it that your son's belongings will no longer-""

""It doesn't matter. I'm taking my American ass back to my homeland. I don't want your people's ugly manners rubbing off on my kids. If it's not one thing, it's another. You keep making these hollow promises, but here we are again. This little boy has been giving Aizen problems for months now and all you do is let his ill-mannered mother talk to us like we don't understand what she's saying.

""French is their first language, Bitch,"" I turn my attention to the woman. ""And you have taught my very well-behaved son a few words I've had to punish him for. So, no there is no way in hell my kids are staying here for another year. So, thank you for your service. Let's hope none of you are ever treated like shit when you come to the States. But by the looks of both of you. I doubt you'll ever be able to afford it. I'll wait for my daughter and the paperwork outside,""

Aizen jumps off the chair in his little uniform and walks out the door as I hold it open for him. I sit him in the only chair available and notice his undone shoelaces. I start to tie them and look up at him to see he's looking back at me with a smirk.

""Sorry, momma,"" he whispers. I sigh and pull his sock up properly.

""What did he do to you?"" I ask.

""It doesn't matter,"" he shakes his head.

""It matters to me, son. I can't make you feel better if you don't talk to me,"" I brush his dark hair out of his face. He looks down at his sleeve and lifts it. There are three scratches from his wrist to the inside of his elbow. ""Did you show your teacher?""

""They don't care, momma,"" he shrugs. ""I beat him up very well,""

The two of us laugh. I glance over at the kid when his mom walks out of the office. He did beat the kid up. He has a bruise on his cheek and the mark where Aizen bit him on the hand. He's right. From the start, they made it pretty clear where we stood. Not only am I American, but not the pretty blonde-haired hair blue-eyed kind.

My mom was, but not my father, and while I'm not as red as he is, I look a lot like him and so do my kids. The dark hair and the tanned skin. It's a stigma we'll never be able to outrun. Here or back home. But it builds character and my kids have grown used to it.

For the most part, they let their work do all the talking. They're both insanely smart and talented. They know that. I was going to let it go, but these marks might leave a scar. This scandal might just be the final fuck you this country needs.

""Mommy,"" Ayrie runs towards us. Her little body smacks against mine. ""We're going home?""

""Yes,"" I nod. ""Let's get out of here,"" 

# 2

I have no problems with spending our last week in Paris together all day long. When we get home, I clean up Aizen's scratches and put some bandaids on them. It doesn't take much to get them in a better mood. All I had to say was that they weren't ever going back there again.

As I box everything up to send to our new home, I have to admit that I am going to miss this place. This is where they were born. Where I struggled for the first few months as a first-time mom until I met Kendra. Their nanny has been a dream since hiring her. She agreed to move here with me and is more than thrilled to be on the same continent as her family again.

Both Aizen and Ayrie took their first steps here. They both called me Mama for the first time here and I am getting very sentimental now. I go to the bathroom so the kids don't see me cry. Kendra sees me though.

""This will be good for you and them,"" she reminds me. ""Us too,""

""I know. It's just, this was our home for so long,""

""I am very excited for California,"" she laughs.

""I am very excited for the kids to see it too,"" I feel much better.

I take the kids to a couple of museums and the Eiffel Tower one last time so we can say goodbye and have lots of pictures. During our flight, I can't help but feel nervous for some reason. Aizen sleeps through most of it but like me, Ayrie doesn't shut her eyes once.

""Mommy, are we going to see Grandpa again this time?""

""Uh,"" I clear my throat remembering how telling my dad I was a mother of two without telling him the name of their father went. ""Not this time. We're moving there. It's going to be our new home,""

""Is it going to be a regular house this time?"" she asks excitedly.

""It'll be an apartment first. I want to find the perfect house. Would you like to help with that?""

""Will it be by the beach?"" she asks excitedly. I may have mentioned we'd be by the beach.

""Would you like it to be?""

""Yes,"" she nods eagerly. ""We never been to the beach,""

""We can go this weekend while we settle in. It's not too far from our apartment,""

""Oui, s'il vous plaît,"" she giggles and crawls onto my lap. ""Do we still have to talk French?""

""Not if you don't want to. In California mostly everyone speaks English,""

""What do the others speaks?""

""It depends, but where we're going I'd have to say Spanish,""

""We don't know Spanish,"" she curls into me.

""No, well. You don't,"" I laugh.

""You do?"" she gasps.

""I do,"" I nod. ""And so does Kenny,""

""Awesome sauce. I want Kenny to teach me Spanish,""

""You don't want me to teach you?""

""I want you to find the perfect beach house, Mommy. Better than Barbie's,"" she laughs.

""Better than Barbie's, huh?"" I tickle her. She giggles and then wraps her arms around me.

""Are you sad, Mommy?"" she asks.

""Why would you ask that?""

""Because Mrs. Reedly said you must be a sad fuck with two kids and no husband,""

Kendra was in the midst of drinking water. She almost spits it out and starts coughing. I have to fight laughing harder than I ever have in my entire life. I hear a couple of laughs from the other private areas in the first-class lounge. Her little French accent only serves in her favor. 

Mrs. Reedly is probably explaining to her husband that they're being sued by some crazy American woman at the moment along with the school who transferred their son to a different private academy.

""No, Ayrie. I am not sad. You are not allowed to repeat that ever again in your life,"" I finally laugh.

""I promise,"" she giggles. ""Can I go lay down with Bubbie?""

""Yeah, I'll take you,"" I sigh and stand.

I take her over to him and tuck her in next to him. It's crazy how alike they look like this. I cover them and signal Kendra to watch them. She's still bright red. She gives me a thumbs up. It was never a secret. I never told anyone I was married and with how public my profile is, the moms all had their laugh at my expense. So did some of my co-workers.

My boss has been trying to set me up left and right, but I honestly didn't have the time between runways and the kids. Sure, Kendra took a lot of the weight off, but there was no way I was going to end up with a French man. My father would hunt both of us down.

I wash my hands and open the door to get back to my seat. The door across from me opens at the same time and a man steps out before I can.

""Excuse me,"" he says politely.

My heart stops and my ears immediately start to ring. I close my eyes and shake my head. No. There is no fucking way that's him. I step out just enough to watch him go over to the back area furthest away from the twins and then he turns around. It is him. I all but run to my seat.

""You okay?"" Kendra asks when I fall into my seat and grab one of the blankets to cover myself with it as if it would make me disappear.

""This is not happening,"" I whisper to myself.

""Oh, do you need a tampon?"" she whispers.

""What?"" I ask her caught off guard.

""What?"" she asks defensively. ""Why are you all squirrelly, Phoebs?""

""No reason,"" I clear my throat. I reach for a water bottle.

""Phoebe, you're shaking,"" she places her hand over mine. ""Did something happen?""

""No,"" I shake my head. I take a couple of deep breaths. ""I just feel a little light-headed,""

""Here, lie back. You're pale,""

There is no way he'll recognize me. He's on the other side of the plane. It was a long time ago. I don't even have long hair anymore and I'm dressed differently. Right? Right. Oh, my god. What are the odds of this happening? Then again, what are the odds of what happened before happening? The fucking odds are always aligned. Shit.

""I got you some sparkling water,"" Kendra returns with a little green bottle.

""Thank you,"" I take it.

""New home jitters?"" she asks playfully.

""No, just the ghosts of the past,"" I mumble.

""I hear that,"" she sits across from me. I forget she has crazy good hearing.

The twins are up and ready to get off the plane when we land.

There's no way we're going to see him again. At least, that is what I'm telling myself as we get off the plane and head down to get our luggage. As luck has it, I don't see him again. I get my things and set them down as Kendra tells the kids that California is the coolest place in the world and that it's also her first time here.

""Mommy, Chocolate Sprinkles!"" Ayrie calls out and runs off. I look up to see her bear stuck on the belt.

""Watch this,"" I call out Kendra.

""Got it,"" she laughs. The bear's overalls are stuck on the edge of the belt and I can't get it out.

""Excuse me,"" I call out as I struggle. I'm almost to the end of the belt when a hand reaches out and unhooks it. I stumble back making sure nothing happened to my baby's favorite bear. ""Thank you, so much. This my baby's-"" I stop when I see him standing there. ""Favorite bear,""

""You're welcome,"" he smiles. I press my lips together and nod stupidly. ""Do I know you?"" he asks stopping me. ""You seem familiar,""

""Shit,"" I clear my throat.

""It's you,"" he adds quietly. ""My good girl,""

""Fuck,"" I laugh and spin around to face him. ""I was hoping you didn't recognize me,""

""I take offense to that, Angel,"" he smirks.

""Mommy. You found him,"" Ayrie points up at me.

""Huh?"" my mind glitches for a second and then I realize what she's talking about when she snatches the bear out of my hands.

""I'm sorry, Chocolate Sprinkles,"" she says dusting his overalls and then hugs him tightly.

""Momma, my strap came apart,"" Aizen comes over to me holding out his carry-on.

""I told you to stop tugging on it,"" I remind him. He laughs and holds it up so I can fix it.

""You have two,"" Knighty looks between them. He looks stunned.

""Yeah, these are my kids. Aizen and Ayrie,"" I say mindlessly. Why did I say that to him?

""You're the guy from the TV,"" Ayrie shouts excitedly. I cover her mouth and pull her to me.

""Oh, my god! It's Knightly Blake,"" someone screams.

""Just like her Mom, huh?"" he steps back and pulls his hoodie over his head. ""I'll see you around, Phoebe,""

""Kenny,"" I call out picking up Ayrie.

She lifts up Aizen and we grab our things trying to dodge the people running past us. God, that was a good save, baby girl. People swarm past us as we try to get the hell out of there. We make it to the exit to find our driver holding up a sign with my last name on it. We hurry over to him. He leads us out to his van. Two car seats are waiting inside for us. I don't hesitate to hide the twins.

""You know Knightly Blake?"" Kendra asks when we're finally moving. ""How?""

""I don't want to talk about it,"" I shake my head and try to catch my breath.

""That's nuts,"" she laughs. ""I fucking hate that guy,""

""You're not supposed to say that word,"" Aizen scolds her.

""Right,"" she nods. ""I hate him,""

Knightly

I didn't think I'd ever see her again. Phoebe. I never really got over our encounter. It's not every day one meets their soulmate like that. To say it surprises me that she's married and has kids is an understatement.

We didn't really talk much that night, but our connection was instant. The way she said my name. How she touched me. She asked for nothing in return after she let me have her every way I could think of. The vinyl was the only thing I could leave behind. Had I stayed and let her wake up, things would have ended badly for both of us. Has she thought of me since then?

She's as beautiful as the first time I ran into her. This encounter is as bad as the last one. That itch I thought had disappeared is stirring and I don't want it to.

""You made a scene at the airport,"" Pete says and drops into the armchair across from me.

""I ran into someone,"" I explain.

""Do tell,"" Rip pushes my leg off his coffee table. His wife glares at me.

""Sorry,"" I apologize and sit up straight.

""Who was it?"" she asks.

""Do you guys remember the girl from six years ago?""

""The girl that inspired the album that followed?"" Pete laughs. ""Yeah, we remember Phoebe,""

""That's who I ran into,""

""What?"" they all sit up. I laugh at their reaction.

""Did you at least get her number?"" Rip smacks my leg.

""No, I didn't, and even if I had. She's married now. Has two kids,""

""Aww,"" Felicity taps my knee. ""That sucks, man,""

""Yeah,"" it really fucking does.

""Did she get fat at least?"" Pete scoffs. We all laugh.

""Not even a little. She cut her hair. She looked so fucking good,"" I admit and sit back. ""Her daughter looks just like her,""

""That's cute. What did you say her name was?"" Felicity asks.

""Phoebe,"" Pete answers.

""Let's see who the lucky fuck that married her is,"" she laughs. ""Do we have a last name?""

""The sign her driver was carrying read Altaha,"" I say.

""She's native?"" Pete asks.

""I think so. Mixed maybe. She has dark blue eyes. Like navy blue eyes,"" I nod. They all laugh at me. That was sappy, even for me.

""Are you sure? All that comes up with that name is the new CEO of Royal Threads in SoCal,""

""What? Wait, that might be her. She said she was a clothes designer when we met. She had drawings all over her suite,""

""No, fucking way,"" she laughs and hands me her phone.

""That's her,"" I nod. They all bunch in around us to get a look at her. Wow, she's really got her shit together.

""Dude, she is so fucking hot,"" Pete nods.

""I'd think about that all day long too, if I were you,"" Rip momentarily forgets his wife is in the room and gets a slap to the back of the head. ""Sorry, baby,""

""Aww, they're so fucking cute,"" she wiggles next to me. ""Oh, look at the little boy. He has a guitar,"" she switches the picture to the kid sitting on her lap while she strums the guitar for him when he's about one or two. The baby loves it. ""Oh, my god. He plays,"" she moves to the next video. It's the boy as old as he is now playing a baby blue electric guitar customized for him. ""Did she try to make him look like you?""

""Her husband,"" I roll my eyes.

""I don't see one,"" she says as she continues to scroll through. ""Wait, here,"" my stomach clenches when she stops. ""This is from like three years ago,""",1,1746438505.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Jack Davis describes this stay in his article [Glimpse of Ruhiyyih Khanum and Her 17 Days in Korea](https://bahai-library.com/khanum_korea_1984).   A [March 30, 2010 article](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20090602000134) in *[The Korea Herald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Korea_Herald)* quoted [Firaydun Mithaq](http://bahairecollections.com/author/dr-firaydun-mithaq/) as saying ""the number of the Bahá'ís in Korea is not over 200 active believers.""


 
Glimpse of Ruhiyyih Khanum and Her 17 Days in Korea
by Jack Davis
She said while here that once Shoghi Effendi asked her what she would do after his passing. She said she was so astonished by the question which she had not thought about, that she just looked at him. He answered that you will travel and teach and love the people. Since 1957 she has certainly done just that. Even reigning queens of bygone ages are largely recorded by history in terms of dates and events, as they had very little effect on the people. Not one of them could be said to have had influence over the entire world.



**Indeed we stand too close to Ruhiyyih Khanum to fully grasp her influence and station. If the station of the Hands of the Cause is higher than that of the lesser prophets of the old like Isaiah, Daniel and others, how limited is our understanding of their true rank. What woman of past dispensations was not only the marriage partner of the Head of the Faith, but his confidante, friend, secretary and solace, as well as being an active believer, teacher, author and a high-ranking individual in her own right? Ruhiyyih Khanum has a very distinct and interesting personality, characterized by a sense of humor, an incisively probing mind, true courtesy and warmth, and yet it is basically very simple.**



**The likes of Ruhiyyih Khanum, nee Mary Maxwell, will never pass this way again. There has been no such woman in the past 6,000 years of recorded history, nor will there be another like her, at least not until after the next Manifestation of God in a thousand years. She came to Korea in May of 1984 for seventeen glorious days … and she conquered it.**



Over 30 of the friends waited at the Kimpo International airport with a huge banner screaming, “WELCOME”! She ‘appeared’ from out of the door of customs, and began greeting the Baha’is, posed for a picture with flowers presented to her, and was off to her hotel. It seemed as if unconsciously the noise in the crowded airport went down a quantum jump – to a hush.



The next day was a free one for her. **She visited a famous acupuncturist, as she did during all the days in Seoul, and when she came out she said, “We are relaxed, happy, confident and secure.” Later she said of him, “We should be grateful this man is on this earth … he knows what he is talking about.” He said about her that she was a “living god”.**



The public meeting on the 8th, held in a gorgeous emerald green room in the prestigious Lotte Hotel, attracted over 100 people. It was Buddha’s Birthday, a holiday and one day after the Pope has left Korea, so the attendance was amazing. Her dignity, ability to make people feel at ease, to feel that the Faith is really so simple, her perfect diction and melodious voice captivated as usual.



She gave a simple, logical explanation, and, interestingly enough near the end spoke of the persecutions. She told of a mother and a daughter on the bus going to prison to be hanged. The mother, to quite her daughter’s fears, said in comforting and sweet way, “Don’t worry. I will ask the guards to hang me first, and then you will see that it is not so bad.”



At the luncheon the following day with the local pioneers and two Japanese who had come just for her visit, when someone tried to take her plate away thinking that she was finished, she said, **“Oh, no! Two-hundred-million Chinese are starving to death and another four-hundred-million are almost starving, so the least I can do is finish everything on my plate.”**



**She talked about the process of deepening people who accept the Faith. “It means”, she said, “’go back’, just go back and they will be deepened.”**



At the Press Conference with reporters from 3 Seoul dailies, she said to them that it didn’t really matter to her whether they wrote anything about what she said or not, however she hoped that they as young men and women would look into this Faith, and whether they accepted it or not was not the point.



**“It is just that you should know what it will come to mean in the world.” She added, “If you want a headline, I can give you one: ‘A Religion At Last That Practices What It Preaches.’!”**



**One reporter over coffee said that she was beautiful. She retorted, “You should have seen me 30 years ago!”**



Articles were printed, not only in Seoul, but in Pusan, Kwang and Taejeon. She met with a reporter of the government news agency for a special interview.



**On her travels throughout the country she was accompanied by [Violette Nakhjavani](http://bahaiblog.net/site/2011/10/in-memory-of-violette-nakhjavani/), the National Assembly Secretary, Mr Jeong Ha Tack, and many others who would join at different times to be with her or to translate.** Besides Seoul, she visited about 10 other localities, including cities, town and rural areas. In Mokpo her talk of the importance of the Institutions vied with the horns and other traffic noises outside the window.



**Going on the boat to Anjwa, she was sitting on the bow much to consternation of the crew and friends. But when cautioned, she said, “Please leave me alone. I know what I am doing.”**



She later suggested to the Universal House of Justice that a Center should be built on the island in the area of several islands with hundreds and hundreds of Baha’is.



In Pusan, Kwangju, Sinchon and Kumi, she stressed, among other things how important it is to deepen in the Teachings. She likened the necessity of this to the way a tree grows strong. The heavy winds and rain force its roots to go deep. Tests and studying help us to put out spiritual roots down deep.



In Kumi she met the Mayor of the city in a most cordial atmosphere. At public meetings in Daegu, Keong Sang North and Anyang, a suburb of Seoul, her references to the simple one-nesses of the Faith, the education of children and, in one case, a reference to suffering of the friends in Iran captivated those attending.



During free time, she visited several Buddhist Temples in different areas. The Chief Monk of one Temple instantly and reverently recognized her spirit and [after] they had a long talk, he accepted the principles of the oneness of religion. She promised him a book which was later delivered. She also toured museums, and visited the grave of a famous General, Kim Yu Sin, in Kyungju, and went to the Haing Nam Ceramic center.



Many of the Korean friends were impressed by her praying in the Temples, her childlike innocence, frankness and delighted at all she saw. She remarked to them, **“You are a good-looking people, especially your noses.”**



She exclaimed over the deliciousness of Korean food, and in general showed her deep appreciation of things Korean.



There was a dinner on her last evening in Seoul in celebration of the Declaration of the Bab. While still at the table she cut out a paper ballerina doll for one of the little girls, colored it, and before giving it to the child, asked, “What shall we name her? Let’s call her ‘Mary’, my name.”



Later, slides were shown of the Holy Land and particularly of the Shrine of the Bab. Ruhiyyih Khanum spoke of her father’s part in its construction under the direction of Shoghi Effendi.



**Ruhiyyih Khanum felt that her trip was a success. The friends will never be quite the same. She gave glimpses of other dimensions of what it means to be a Baha’i. A vision of ourselves as Baha’is and of future of the Faith were lovingly and clearly implanted in the hearts of over six-hundred souls who met her during the seventeen memorable days. The Korean friends gained a new understanding of their role and a stronger grasp of a statement made in London by Ruhiyyih Khanum herself: “The Faith of Baha’u’llah belongs to all those who believe in Him.”**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unlocking More from Your Morning Brew

Many people rely on coffee to jumpstart their day, thanks to its caffeine content that boosts alertness and energy. However, when coffee is combined with adaptogenic mushrooms, the benefits extend far beyond what caffeine alone offers. Adaptogenic mushrooms like reishi, lion’s mane, and chaga have been used for centuries in traditional medicine because of their ability to enhance the body’s resilience to stress and improve cognitive function.

By blending these mushrooms with coffee, you create a powerful synergy that promotes sustained energy, sharper focus, and better overall well-being. This combination is becoming increasingly popular among health enthusiasts who want a natural yet effective way to navigate demanding days without the jitters or sudden crashes often associated with caffeine.

### What Are Adaptogenic Mushrooms?

Adaptogenic mushrooms are a unique group of fungi known for their stress-reducing properties and ability to support the body's natural balance. Here are some commonly used adaptogenic mushrooms:

- **Lion’s Mane:** Noted for enhancing brain function, memory, and concentration.
- **Reishi:** Valued for its calming effects and immune system support.
- **Chaga:** Packed with antioxidants, it helps combat oxidative stress and inflammation.
- **Cordyceps:** Known to boost stamina and energy at the cellular level.

Each mushroom brings its own set of benefits, making their addition to coffee a holistic approach to improving both mental and physical energy.

### How This Combination Enhances Energy Levels

Coffee provides a quick caffeine boost that stimulates the central nervous system. While this can increase alertness, it sometimes leads to a spike followed by a sudden energy crash. Adaptogenic mushrooms help smooth out this energy curve by regulating the body's response to caffeine and supporting adrenal health.

For example, cordyceps mushrooms enhance the production of ATP—the main energy currency in cells—resulting in improved endurance and vitality. Lion’s mane supports nerve growth factor (NGF), which directly impacts brain health, offering prolonged mental stamina without the typical jittery feeling.

### Sharper Focus and Mental Clarity

One of the biggest challenges with caffeine consumption alone is maintaining steady focus throughout the day. While it might give you a burst of alertness, distractions and mental fatigue can quickly follow. Adaptogenic mushrooms like lion’s mane promote neurogenesis—the growth of new brain cells—and strengthen synaptic connections.

This biological support helps you stay clear-headed and attentive for longer periods. Add that to caffeine’s stimulating effects, and you get a powerful mental edge that supports productivity and concentration during intense work or study sessions.

### Supporting Stress Resistance and Calmness

Caffeine can sometimes amplify feelings of stress or anxiety, especially if you consume it in excess. Adaptogenic mushrooms counteract this by modulating the body’s stress-response system. Reishi is particularly effective in promoting relaxation while still providing focused energy.

When combined, coffee and adaptogenic mushrooms offer a balanced experience: increased energy without the common side effects of nervousness or restlessness. This balance helps sustain a calm focus, which is essential for handling daily stressors efficiently.

### Immune System and Antioxidant Boost

Regular consumption of adaptogenic mushrooms supports immune health. Chaga, rich in antioxidants, protects the body from free radicals, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. This means you’re not just enhancing your energy and focus but also bolstering your overall health with every cup of mushroom-infused coffee.

### How to Incorporate Adaptogenic Mushrooms Into Your Coffee

- **Mushroom Coffee Blends:** Pre-made powders that combine ground mushrooms with coffee for easy brewing.
- **Adding Mushroom Extracts:** Mix tinctures or powdered extracts of adaptogenic mushrooms into your regular coffee.
- **DIY Mushroom Coffee:** Brew your own combination using mushroom powders and fresh coffee grounds to customize flavor and potency.

This flexibility allows you to enjoy the benefits whether you’re at home, in the office, or on the go.

### Final Thoughts on Maximizing Energy and Focus Naturally

Combining coffee with adaptogenic mushrooms is more than just a trendy beverage choice. It is a smart strategy to unlock sustained energy, promote mental clarity, and nurture your body’s ability to manage stress. By choosing this powerful blend, you’re investing in a balanced approach that supports your daily performance and long-term wellness.

Next time you brew coffee, consider adding a touch of adaptogenic mushroom powder to experience a smoother, more focused kind of energy that works harmoniously with your body’s natural rhythms.

How Adaptogenic Mushrooms Support Stress Relief and Immunity When Paired with Coffee
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div> When life becomes hectic and stress levels rise, many people turn to coffee for that quick boost of energy. While coffee is known for its ability to enhance focus and alertness, combining it with adaptogenic mushrooms can offer a unique way to support stress relief and strengthen your immune system at the same time. Adaptogenic mushrooms like reishi, chaga, lion’s mane, and cordyceps have been used for centuries in traditional medicine for their health benefits. Blending these powerful fungi with your daily cup of coffee creates a synergy that promotes overall well-being far beyond what coffee alone can provide.

### Understanding Adaptogenic Mushrooms and Their Role

 Adaptogenic mushrooms are natural substances that help the body adapt to physical and mental stress. Unlike stimulants that simply give you a quick energy burst, adaptogens work by balancing your body’s stress response. This means they help regulate cortisol levels, stabilize mood, and improve resilience to everyday stressors. When paired with coffee, adaptogenic mushrooms can soften the hustle-related jitters and calm the nervous system without reducing the energizing effect of caffeine.

### The Stress-Relief Benefits of Adaptogenic Mushrooms with Coffee

 Coffee, while energizing, can sometimes increase anxiety or contribute to the “crash” that many experience later in the day. Adaptogenic mushrooms work differently to smooth out these peaks and valleys. Here’s how they help:

- **Reishi:** Often called the “mushroom of immortality,” reishi is known for its calming properties. It reduces anxiety and promotes relaxation, making it an ideal partner to coffee’s stimulating effects.
- **Lion’s Mane:** This mushroom supports cognitive function and memory while simultaneously protecting against stress-related brain fog.
- **Chaga:** Chaga is packed with antioxidants that fight oxidative stress and inflammation, helping your body recover better during stressful times.
- **Cordyceps:** Known for boosting energy and endurance, cordyceps helps offset fatigue without overstimulating, complementing coffee’s alertness.
 
 By incorporating these mushrooms, your daily coffee cup transforms from a simple stimulant to a holistic health booster that supports your mental and emotional balance, allowing you to face challenges with more calmness and clarity.

### How Adaptogenic Mushrooms Enhance Immunity Together with Coffee

 Beyond stress management, adaptogenic mushrooms are celebrated for their immune-enhancing properties. Chronic stress often weakens the immune system, leaving you vulnerable to illness. Fortunately, many adaptogenic mushrooms contain beta-glucans and other polysaccharides that strengthen immune defenses.

 Drinking coffee fused with these mushrooms provides a double benefit:

- **Immune Support:** Mushrooms like reishi and chaga stimulate white blood cell activity and improve natural killer cell function, helping your body recognize and fight off pathogens more efficiently.
- **Antioxidant Protection:** Both coffee and mushrooms supply antioxidants. Their combination creates a powerful defense against free radicals that can damage cells and weaken immunity over time.
 
 This powerful partnership fuels your body’s ability to maintain optimal immune function, even when you’re facing heightened stress or environmental challenges.

### Tips for Adaptogenic Mushrooms Into Your Coffee Routine

 If you’re ready to experience the benefits of combining adaptogenic mushrooms with coffee, here are some ways to get started:

- **Mushroom Coffee Blends:** Many brands offer pre-mixed mushroom coffee powders that you can brew just like normal coffee.
- **Mushroom Extracts:** Add powdered or liquid mushroom extracts directly to your brewed coffee. Start with a small amount to see how it affects your body.
- **Mushroom Capsules:** Take mushroom supplements separately and enjoy your coffee as usual for those who prefer not to alter the taste of their coffee.
 
 When trying this combo, be mindful of your caffeine sensitivity and how the mushrooms affect your energy and mood. Everyone’s body reacts differently, so gradual introduction is key.

### Why Choose the Coffee and Adaptogenic Mushroom Combo?

 Coffee alone is a daily ritual for billions, valued for its flavor and wakefulness. Adaptogenic mushrooms, on the other hand, bring centuries of herbal wisdom focused on balance and longevity. When these two come together, they create a thoughtful way to enjoy your caffeine ritual while also caring for your body’s stress response and immune health effortlessly. This combination suits anyone looking to enhance mental clarity, reduce the negative side effects of caffeine, and support long-term wellness.

 The next time you sip your coffee, consider adding adaptogenic mushrooms to unlock a richer, more nourishing experience that supports you through stressful days and strengthens your immune defenses naturally.

</div>### Conclusion

Combining coffee with adaptogenic mushrooms offers a powerful boost to your daily routine by enhancing both energy and focus in a balanced way. While coffee alone can sometimes lead to jitteriness or a quick energy crash, adding adaptogenic mushrooms helps smooth out that energy, providing a steady, long-lasting alertness without the typical spikes and drops. You get the sharp mental clarity from coffee, now complemented by the calming properties of these mushrooms, making it easier to tackle your day with sustained concentration.

Beyond just boosting energy, this combination supports your body’s ability to handle stress and strengthens your immune system. Adaptogenic mushrooms are well-known for their natural stress-fighting qualities, helping your body adapt better to daily pressures. When paired with coffee, they can reduce feelings of overwhelm and promote a sense of calm while keeping your mind active. Plus, many adaptogenic mushrooms have antioxidants and compounds that enhance immune function, giving your body extra defense against illness.

By integrating adaptogenic mushrooms into your coffee, you create a synergistic effect that not only elevates your energy and focus but also supports your overall health and well-being. This blend is an easy, natural way to fuel your body and mind, helping you feel more balanced, resilient, and ready to handle whatever challenges come your way. If you want to upgrade your coffee experience, this combo is definitely worth trying.

His name is Matt. When he fist met us his first words were. ""Want some Taco Bell?"" My first thought is. "" I like this dude."" We all hung out a few times. Then we got an itch to move to Reno Nevada. Everything was fine until our landlord found out he could get $1500 a month for our $750 a month studio. After that he made our lives a living hell. Demanding that we bleach the walls once a week. Bringing different people in to our apartment constantly without notice. So we came back to Poplar Bluff defeated. My cousin hooked us up with a place to stay. It was a horrible place. We paid them $300 to stay for a month. The Guy was well over 400lbs and spent all the money we gave them on McDonald's sighting that his size meant he had to eat at least 12 times a day. The woman and child were very quiet almost check out of life. A friend gave us a card with almost $500 on it. We ended up using most of it to feed them. When the day came that the guy started demanding more money saying it wasn't enough. We decided to find other arrangements. We found Matt and his wife at the local gas station playing scratcher cards. This to us was a god sent. We ask if we could stay till the first. Matt offered us his pull out couch in the living room. Somehow it turned into us paying rent and Matt and his brother decided that we should have the spare bedroom. Then one day we met her. Matt's mom. She had an sense of entitlement about her. Her first words when we met her was not. Nice to meet you. How long have you known them. Not even who are they? It was ""Have you ran a background check on them?"" He explained that he had in fact known us for years and that we were quiet people that stuck to ourselves. She came back two days later and said with a clear look of annoyance ""Well there is nothing on them."" After that she would show up mostly when Matt's brother wasn't home demanding money in a way as to indicate that he owed it to her. After a while I learned that before he became disabled and was working that she demanded 20% of his wages as a tribute to her being his mother. I call it the family tax. She even tried to pull thing on Matt's younger brother. His name is Josh. Josh is ex military. He had a great job working on cell towers. Josh also had a mistrust for his mom and younger brother who I won't name that bordered hatred. One time when their mom went into the hospital we had to talk him into even going to see her. Later on we found out that he refuse at first because she wanted him to buy her a brand new wood burning stove. Matt's youngest brother on the other hand was the total opposite. Living rent free at his mom's. No rent, food covered, booze, drugs. He runs around terrorizing Their small town and his mom somehow gets him out of it every time. He is a golden child protected and entitled to the point that when his mom is gone life is going to be horrible for him. If he doesn't end up getting killed first. In the years since we came back Matt left his wife and he turned the house over to us. As part of it we watch out for him and protect him when we can. But thru the years we have discovered things about his mom. Disturbing things. Like we noticed how when she ask Matt for things she will shift her hips and play with her hair in a flirty manner with a sickeningly sweet ""Will you buy this for me?"" or "" I am going to be broke this month. I don't know what I'm going to do.""  These actions mixed with these words will cause Matt to do anything she wants and she knows it. Then if he ignores it all hell breaks out. We have had this woman try to burn us in every way imaginable. Little did she know that I came from a family full of people like her and every time she did I hit back 10x harder. I mean I am a nice guy but if you try to hurt me I will destroy your world. This has been going on and off for years. Matt gets paid 2 times a month now and he has gotten her down to $100 each payday and $20 for gas and $20 to gamble with. But now his stepdad is back in the picture. So every time we are not watching him his stepdad will get Matt to buy him a $10 cup of coffee, two packs of cigarettes and pizza each time he pays his family taxes. Sometimes she still hits him so hard that he can't even pitch in here.  It's a constant battle. Then the other day we found out that the gold child. Who is mind you damn near 30. Often sleeps in the same bed with her. He lives in a prison on his own though. She won't let him have a girlfriend for too long or she will start brain washing the girls to cause conflict. AKA controlled chaos. We have had people ask us if Matt and his mom were a couple. Their interaction are not like a mother and son but like a boyfriend and girlfriend. This is the way his mom tried to raise them all. Kat looked it up one day. It is called emotional incest. It is when a family member blurs the lines between family love and romantic love. Surprisingly most often put into effect by female family members. Well next week all three of then her, the golden child and the stepdad are going to be here for Mother's Day. That is going to be fun considering they normally won't leave until Matt gives her stuff around the house to get rid of her. I guess it is more of the training she gave him. We are planning on as soon as I go into remission again. Selling this house and moving as far away as we can afford.",1,1746437527.0,RealRealLife,0,1.0,False

Hiked up to **Mullayanagiri**, the highest peak in Karnataka, and also explored **Baba Budangiri**. The views from both were just amazing endless hills, clouds floating real low, and silence you just don’t get in cities anymore.

The highlight for me was **Hebbe Falls**, hands down the most beautiful waterfall I’ve seen till now. Totally worth the bumpy ride to reach there.

If you’re into hills, coffee and slow mornings – this place is a vibe. Can share more details if anyone’s planning a trip.

* **Hotel stay**: ₹3000 for 2 nights (basic clean stay)
* **Bike rent**: ₹1000 (to get around easily)
* **Food & coffee**: Around ₹2000 (tried some local spots too)

* Back when I ate the SAD, I used to have severe anemia; to the point where I was rushed to the ER over it, as I literally couldn't move my left side. Scary experience. (Especially since the doctor said I ""was faking it"".) Part of this was consuming antacids like candy, so calcium was blocking both iron and potassium absorption. *Don't do what I did.*
* It got slightly better when I got on Keto, but it would still kick my butt if I didn't take meds. Then I found out those meds were actually poisoning me (yay Vitamin B overdose), so I dropped them.
* Then I found out I had a giant list of allergies. Cutting out various foods helped to improve my digestion, so iron levels were a bit better.
* ...but I eventually I had to order new meds, because it turned out my iron levels became low again despite eating Keto.
* Switched over to Carnivore and... still sometimes have iron issues, though now I take a pill weekly rather than daily, so it's an improvement.

Recently:

* Found out I have histamine intolerance.
* I've been cutting out various non-meat foods to see what gives me issues and what doesn't. Mainly dairy.
* I admit I haven't been 100% Carnivore, and was still consuming coffee and unsweetened chocolate... which I cut chocolate out a few days ago, because I thought I was bloated by some. Tonight, I ate a couple pieces just to see how my body would react, and... yep. Bloating, lethargy, joint pain. Not doing that again!
* This food removal unfortunately also includes cutting out foods like cottage cheese and yogurt; the former gives me itchiness and rashes, the latter gives me indigestion. I stopped eating most cheese, and ate a few slices of swiss a few days later... I think they made my stomach upset, but I can't really tell.

Currently:

* At this point all I'm consuming are various meats (except eggs because I'm allergic, and shellfish because one of the people is allergic to those). Heavy cream, butter/tallow... and sometimes small bits of A2 milk as a pick-me-up, because cutting out some of my favorite foods is kinda depressing.
* I also consume coffee, but I'm down to 1 cup a day - and should probably cut down to half a serving per day as my next step.
* I'm also supplementing liver through freeze-dried capsules, but would much rather prefer to properly cook liver and take small bits per day so I get the most benefit. Advice on cooking it is appreciated.

tl;dr - 34F, Used to be severely anemic on SAD, went Keto, went Carnivore (ish). Have been cutting out dairy partially because I thought would be beneficial for calcium and iron levels. I feel like I'm still being affected by low iron levels.

I was wondering if anybody had any clue if my body will recover from that sort of thing.  
It would be very nice to not have to worry about it, and it'd be one less med to take.

1kf7eov,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1kf7eov/how_the_hell_do_people_cope/,How the hell do people cope.,"I’m 30 male. I’m 100 days into my ex fiancé leaving me after 7 years together. She dumped me over the phone. She kept our dog and now we are selling our home. The only contact we have is regarding selling the property and it’s all formal. Also lost my job a few months before and got diagnosed with adhd. 

For the last 7 years I focused solely on that relationship, and neglected all my other relationships, so now have basically no friends. I have 2 “friends” technically but we are very different people and there is distance there in terms of either culture or age. I also burnt myself out in my career, I taught myself software nights and weekends and spent loads of free time working on business ventures to improve our lives, because whenever I asked my ex if she wanted to do something she’d say no I need space, then just watch Netflix alone or go on fucking TikTok. I even made a decent money from a project. But I realise now my ex never gave a single shit that I was doing this, she never asked what I was working on, never took interest, would tell me to shut up about my projects and to lower my voice, and when I’d be excited about a project saying this one is going to be successful she would just say “I’ve heard it all before”. 

I’m doing literally everything I can to make positive opportunities for myself - I go into the office 5 days a week, i go to therapy once a week, I gym 5 days a week doing weights 3 days and cardio daily (after a 5 year hiatus), I eat healthy 3x a day, I started new hobbies with strangers (bouldering once a week and rock climbing twice a week), I take myself out for breakfast/lunch/dinner on weekends, I cycle and walk everywhere, I go to new spots every weekend, I attend meetup events with strangers. I’ve even started getting regular coffees with a nice girl from work as friends.

But the loneliness is crushing. It hits me when I’m out in public, I think wtf am I doing here and with these strangers. There’s no familiarity to anything I do anymore. There’s no one to talk to when I go home. No one messages me or reaches out to me, I have to initiate everything all the time with anyone. It’s like no one gives a shit about me, so I just keep thinking I must be broken as a person. How can no one give a shit about me? I give a shit about a lot of people and I let them know I do. 

I feel like I have depressing knowledge I shouldn’t have. The depression and darkness has been extreme, to the point where I feel like my mind and worldview has been poisoned. I feel like I’ve seen how the sausage is made now, and I can’t enjoy anything anymore. I can’t even bond with my parent’s dog anymore, I just find him frustrating. I’ve changed so much for the worse. I’m broken. I don’t trust my job prospects for any stability, I don’t trust that anyone I date is strong enough to date me long term, I don’t trust that people will stick around, it’s like I need to be this perfect person for anyone to have anything to do with me / and I’m very fucking imperfect and constantly fail and make mistakes ",3,1746437473.0,lonely,1,1.0,False

1kf77va,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kf77va,"Vietnam - Ha Giang Loop, Solo","Did the Ha Giang Loop solo this April, and hands down this goes straight to the top of my solo trip list. I’ve done quite a few trips alone but this one hit different – the views, the roads, the peace, and the people.

Landed in Hanoi, stayed a night in a cheap Airbnb. Next day took a sleeper bus to Ha Giang – booked via VeXeRe app (smooth and on time). Grab is everywhere in Hanoi, no stress with taxis.

Rented a Honda XR150L for 4 days. Bike was powerful enough for the mountain roads and fun as hell. No guide, no group – just me, the road, and Google Maps (which worked most of the time). Stayed at different places on the loop, some booked on Airbnb, others on Booking.com.

Ate at random places – some fancy spots, some local joints. I drank way too much Vietnamese coffee and no regrets. Fuel was cheap, but I spent quite a bit on food because I kept stopping at places just to try random stuff.

Got stopped by police once, and heads-up – Indian IDP was not accepted. They asked for local license, I didn’t have, so ended up paying 2 million VND as a “fine” aka bribe. You can try bargaining, I managed to bring it down a bit but yeah, prepare for this.

On the last day, took the bus back to Hanoi and stayed one more night before flying out.


---

Cost Breakdown (4 days trip):

Total: ~6,600,000 VND ≈ ₹21,860

(Add flights if you’re calculating full trip, mine not included here)


---

Notable Points / Tips:

SIM – Don’t buy at airport. I got Viettel SIM from official store in city, cheap and strong signal even in remote areas.

Grab – Use this app for local taxis in Hanoi. Works like a charm.

VeXeRe app – Best app to book long-distance buses in Vietnam.

Accommodations – I booked through Airbnb and Booking.com, all online, all easy.

I thought, in good conscience I'll give it a quick Google before posting here. Google's AI says this:

""The original V energy drink flavor, Green V, is described as having a strong coffee flavor. It was initially released in 1997. In 2020, this flavor was brought back as a permanent edition and rebranded as ""V Raspberry Lemonade,"" but it retains the essence of the original coffee taste.""

To me, this does not make sense. To me, V tastes nothing like coffee. Now, the V 'black' that has just recently been re-released in Australia & New Zealand, that is coffee flavoured. There's no hiding that. 

Now ""V Raspberry Lemonade"" to me, does not taste anything like coffee so calling raspberry lemonade a ""coffee flavour"" makes no sense. 

None of the other V flavours I've ever had resemble anything close to coffee except the black.

Green - It's tangy, almost like a sour apple type of candy? But what you guys think? AI is wrong IMHO.",1,1746436436.0,energydrinks,0,1.0,False

The problem is he is very bad at expressing how he feels because he claims feelings don't matter, facts do. So,  years later, I find out he stuffed down some feeling and I feel bad I thought everything was peachy, while he ""processed alone didn't need others"". (Code for: looked down for a while, tired, annoyed by little problems in life, withdrawn and addicted to gaming, leaving me lonely and worried about him.)

Once I suspected he was jealous when he was asking about my interactions with his friend, but tried really hard to look unbothered. It was one of his closest (very extroverted and married) friends we hang as a couple with. The guy was really into getting close to me privately by inviting for coffee when I'm free, spamming million PMs and memes, sending hearts in messages as jokes, and overall if I'm honest, looked a bit ""into me"" while ignoring everyone else during group outings. I kept looking at his wife who is impassive and gave me no feedback. I acted cold for a long while, and now he is more pulled back and cheery with limits, and I no longer feel ill at ease. I was never sure how to act though, because I didn't know if this was his extroversion, or a crush. He never hid his behavior. 


But despite asking, I could never sus out what my hubby wants, because the only response I ever got was: ""I trust only once, so I don't bother with jelaousy."" 
I mean...??? I was asking what makes you comfortable? Your boundaries?


 ""Do whatever you want."" With a shrug. (Something I find absurd because boundaries around the opposite gender to me are about respect, not control. I set some and he respects them too.)


Other than that, I've had instances where single men I thought highly of and knew for a long time, contacted me via social media relentlessly attempting to establish a relationship in private messages after I got married. And every time it was some guy who I considered a neighbor, or acquaintance at most, had no established friendship with, responded to at first mentioning my marriage and kids to eliminate attempts to flirt, before realizing this person is being very weird all of a sudden.

When I told him, he looked annoyed I did, maybe? But I worried if I do not, it would look like I'm entertaining some creep in my DMs. Which I don't even know if it is a boundary for him, tbh.

We game together too and lately a mutual friend, who is a great asset to the group because of skill, liked by all my IRL gaming friends love, kept liking my pictures every day, drew a pic of me and hubby I posted (which hubby snubbed), sent me a DM to repeatedly comment how beautiful I am when I changed my profile pic... I give a polite thank you and that's where that ends, but am worried about acting out of line, or things looking bad, because I don't know where the line is. I talk to this guy a bit every other day in a few words only,  because he ranks with me (is most often online). ""Do whatever you want."" Is so confusing when stuff people consider emotional cheating can range very widely.

Hello all, recently I had an ablation (Pathway and AFL ablation) last week. Prior to the ablation, I suspected I have PAC around early October 2024, as my heart beat feels like it’s having double beats. Then, this month it has gotten ‘bad’ and it would last for 8-9 hours of double beats. At first I didn’t know what PAC was so I initially  thought it was AFib or Atrial Flutter. But upon reading the ECG i took on my apple watch, i think it’s PAC? After my ablation I thought the double heart beats would subside but it continued. It would last for 8-9 hours still, especially after I wake up. I don’t take drink coffee; take alcohol or eat too unhealthily. Any advice on how to reduce or stop the PAC?

1kf6zcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kf6zcy/how_do_i_get_my_friend_to_stop_making_jokes_at_my/,How do I get my friend to stop making jokes at my expense?,"I (24f) have been friends with a girl (28f) for almost a year now, and when we first met and started hanging out she was always really nice. 

However, when I introduced her to my sister and we three went on a trip together, she kept saying little comments and jokes, always saying afterwards, “kidding!! Kidding!!” Like I’m overreacting. 

Here are a few things she’s said to me on a recent trip to Venice: 

“Oh no, did you take a bath in it?” (We were looking at one of the canals that were really dirty, she was implying it was so dirty because I took a bath in it)

“Phew, OP, you’ll have to take a shower first when we get home!” (We’d just passed a spot on the ground where a dog had peed and she was implying that I was making the smell)

She has also intentionally mispronounced my name in a way that I specifically told her I hated  

I didn’t realize how bad it had gotten until the other day I watched Tangled and realized the way she talks to me is exactly the way that Mother Gothel talks to Rapunzel, like when she said, “when I look in this mirror I see a strong, beautiful woman- and then I see you! Just kidding!” (Cue the evil laughter)

This has been going on for almost a year, where if it’s just us two she’ll be nice and lovely to me but if there’s more people she’ll say things. 
My sister and I have talked about it because she’s noticed it too, and we figured that she probably says them to me because she was more familiar with me and didn’t know my sister so she’s making jokes to have an in with the group sort of? 

But it doesn’t stop the fact that the comments are hurtful and I don’t enjoy them. 
Every time I go quiet after she says something she’ll say “you need to stop being so sensitive ohmygod” and so sometimes I say something similar back to her but it’s just not the way my brain is wired- I don’t like saying mean things to people even in jest. 

Regardless of all this, I do enjoy spending time with her and we are really good friends, we do movie nights and coffee and dinners which are all really pleasant. I want to continue being friends with her but I also want to show her how her comments hurt me. 

Any suggestions?

My left leg bore most of the impact and I was diagnosed with a sprained ankle, knee, and lumbar spine. 

I’ve been on crutches for this period, initially couldn’t really weight bare, now I’m able to walk on it. When going short distances round the house I’m limping and pain isn’t too bad, but going up the stairs and walking long distances causes a lot of pain, particularly in my kneecap and hip. It’s also popping which didn’t initially happen. I’ve had my first session of physio and knee was taped up. 

I’ve tried a few times to walk without crutches to like coffee shop and back for a car park, and that hurts a lot but I can walk flat footed with a limp. 

My question is when is it best to start walking without crutches? Am I making my recovery worse by not trying? ",1,1746435570.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

What a difference! Notes tasted, check. No bitterness/sourness, check! Just a very nice cup. Good times.

Only issue I have is that adding the minerals back to the water the dispenser sees it as pollutants. I’ll need to see the average lifespan of a filter and make sure I replace it before it goes bad. All the water experts out there, any suggestions for upping my own water game?

1kf6uml,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kf6uml/ex_dumper_25f_came_back_years_later_and_now/,Ex Dumper (25F) came back years later and now messages me (26M) daily. What does she want ?,"About +2 years ago I (26 M) was in couple with a women (25 F) for about a year. It was mostly long‑distance, lots of calls, a handful of in‑person visits, plenty of “we’re so perfect together” talk. Toward the end she became depressed for several months, and then she broke up with me. A few weeks later I found out she’d started seeing someone else. I accepted the breakup, moved on, and we had zero contact for almost two full years.

A few weeks later she suggested meeting to clear things up about the past. We grabbed coffee. It was awkward, emotional but civil. She apologized, I explained how badly the breakup and silence had hurt. Since that coffee we’ve texted almost every single day. The conversations cover everything, just like when we were together. She sends pictures from her day like office selfies, the lunch she’s eating, shots of her apartment. Whenever something stresses her out she turns to me first (recently she had a mild panic attack and was rapid‑texting me). I’ve basically become her go‑to emotional support line. It feels like the kind of conversation you’d expect between very close friend or a couple.

Problem is she rarely starts the conversation. If I open with a reaction to her IG story she responds within minutes, full of enthusiasm. But if I stay silent, most of the times she stays silent too. The moment I text, the flood of messages resumes as if the blank (1-2 day maximum) never happened.

We haven’t seen each other in person again since that coffee, even though we now live an hour apart.

I’m conflicted. I genuinely like talking to her. Our conversation is fun and the photo glimpses into her day feel intimate. But six months of daily texting with zero hangouts feels weird. Part of me wonders if she’s cautiously testing the waters for romance; another part suspects she just enjoys the comfort and reassurance.

I’d like to have some outside perspective, especially from anyone whose ex dumped them, disappeared, and then re‑appeared like this.

**TL;DR**

* Long distance ex girlfriend broke up with me two years ago and vanished.
* She resurfaced six months ago to apologize. We met once to talk about past.
* Since then she texts daily, sends life pics, vents to me, but never initiates and never makes plans to meet.
* If I don’t text first, she usually doesn’t reach out. If I do, she replies instantly.
* Not sure if she wants romance, friendship, or just validation/reassurance",1,1746435086.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1kf6tgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColorBlind/comments/1kf6tgn/invisible_ink/,Invisible Ink,"So this is a pretty funny story from my friend (Who I’ll name in this story as C) that I did get permission from them to share. So they were dating this person for a few months and things were going great. He (I’ll call him M) was sweet and kind and extremely understanding with C while dating them. It was the best! 

One time they were out on a date and C is a very insanely cool artist who loves LOTR, as does M! So C made a little green hobbit door which was cute as shit for M and C had written on this little green door (basically saying “I LOVE YOU”) with a Red marker/paint. 

Once M received the gift, he went to the bathroom and left C a bit puzzled. He did see the front where the writing clearly was, but didn’t exactly react to C professing their love to M. 

C then asked about this in a pretty vague way on the way home with M from the date, as C was asking him “are you okay with what I said earlier?” Meaning C’s writing on the gift she gave M. 

M just agreed and said yes whatever she said earlier was fine! C thought that this was a bit off because M wasn’t saying “I love you” back to her. 

After a few months they did separate because C didn’t feel M was reciprocating her feelings for him. C’s friend (O) is good friends with M and went to get coffee together. 

M and O were discussing how M was absolutely in love with C and O was a bit puzzled as well. C had told O about the gift and O saw it, also seeing the writing and loved it! 

O told M that C had wrote “I love you” on the gift…

M’s eyes WIDENED…

He said “I didn’t see any writing on it????”

O’s eyes WIDENED…

O showed M the picture of the gift again. 

M goes “I don’t see anything”

C and O then realize as O is telling this to C that M is COLOR BLIND. 

M WAS NEVER ABLE TO SEE THE RED INK ON THE LITTLE GREEN DOOR GIFT. 

BECAUSE HE’S COLOR BLIND.

1kf6rv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kf6rv2/struggling_with_hidream_i1/,Struggling with HiDream i1,"Some observations made while making HiDream i1 work. Newbie level. Though might be useful.  
Also, a huge gratitude to this subreddit community, as lots of issues were already discussed here.  
And special thanks to u/Gamerr for great ideas and helpful suggestions. Many thanks!

Facts i have learned about HiDream:

1. FULL version follows prompts better, than its DEV and FAST counterparts, but it is noticeably slower.
2. \--highvram is a great startup option, use it until ""Allocation on device"" out of memory issue.
3. HiDream uses FLUX VAE, which is bf16, so –bf16-vae is a great startup option too
4. The major role in text encoding belongs to Llama 3.1
5. You can replace Llama 3.1 with funetune, but it must be Llama 3.1 Architecture
6. Making HiDream work on 16GB VRAM card is easy, making it work reasonably fast is hard

  
*so: installing*

My environment: six years old computer with Coffee Lake CPU, 64GB RAM, NVidia 4600Ti 16GB GPU, NVMe storage. Windows 10 Pro.  
Of course, i have little experience with ComfyUI, but i don't posses enough understanding what comes in what weights and how they are processed.

I had to re-install ComfyUI (uh.. again!) because some new custom node has butchered the entire thing and my backup was not fresh enough.

Installation was not hard, and for the most of it i used kindly offered by u/Acephaliax  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1k23rwv/quick\_guide\_for\_fixinginstalling\_python\_pytorch/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1k23rwv/quick_guide_for_fixinginstalling_python_pytorch/) (though i prefer to have illusion of understanding, so i did everything manually)

Fortunately, new XFORMERS wheels emerged recently, so it becomes much less problematic to install ComfyUI  
python version: 3.12.10, torch version: 2.7.0, cuda: 12.6, flash-attention version: 2.7.4  
triton version: 3.3.0, sageattention is compiled from source

Downloading HiDream and proper placing files is in ComfyUI Wiki were also easy.  
[https://comfyui-wiki.com/en/tutorial/advanced/image/hidream/i1-t2i](https://comfyui-wiki.com/en/tutorial/advanced/image/hidream/i1-t2i)

And this is a good moment to mention that HiDream comes in three versions: FULL, which is the slowest, and two distilled ones: DEV and FAST, which were trained on the output of the FULL model.

My prompt contained ""older Native American woman"", so you can decide which version has better prompt adherence

https://preview.redd.it/9cskldo19xye1.png?width=3076&format=png&auto=webp&s=580b8d8cc99a45eac44741b5993009fbc50bbe26

i initially decided to get quantized version of models in GGUF format, as Q8 is better than FP8, also Q5 if better than NF4

  
*Now: Tuning.*

It launched. So far so good. though it ran slow.  
I decided to test which lowest quant fits into my GPU VRAM and set --gpu-only option in command line.  
The answer was: none. The reason is that FOUR (why the heck it needs four text encoders?) text encoders were too big.  
OK. i know the answer - quantize them too! Quants may run on very humble hardware by the price of speed decrease.

So, the first change i made was replacing T5 and Llama encoders with Q8\_0 quants and this required ComfyUI-GGUF custom node.  
After this change Q2 quant successfully launched and the whole thing was running, basically, on GPU, consuming 15.4 GB.

Frankly, i am to confess: Q2K quant quality is not good. So, i tried Q3K\_S and it crashed.  
(i was perfectly realizing, that removing --gpu-only switch solves the problem, but decided to experiment first)  
The specific of OOM error i was getting is that it happened after all KSampler steps, when VAE was applying.

Great. I know what TiledVAE is (earlier i was running SDXL on 166Super GPU with 6GB VRAM), so i changed VAE Decode to its Tiled version.  
Still, no luck. Discussions on GitHub were very useful, as i discovered there, that HiDream uses FLUX VAE, which is bf16

So, the solution was quite apparent: adding --bf16-vae to command line options to save resources wasted on conversion. And, yes, i was able to launch the next quant Q3\_K\_S on GPU. (reverting VAE Decode back from Tiled was a bad idea). Higher quants did not fit in GPU VRAM entirely. But, still, i discovered --bf16-vae option helps a little.

At this point I also tried an option for desperate users --cpu-vae. It worked fine and allowed to launch Q3K\_M and Q4\_S, the trouble is that processing VAE by CPU took very long time - about 3 minutes, which i considered unacceptable. But well, i was rather convinced i did my best with VAE (which cause a huge VRAM usage spike at the end of T2I generation).

So, i decided to check if i can survive with less number of text encoders.

There are Dual and Triple CLIP loaders for .safetensors and GGUF, so first i tried Dual.

1. First finding: Llama is the most important encoder.
2. Second finding: i can not combine T5 GGUF with LLAMA safetensors and vice versa.
3. Third finding: triple CLIP loader was not working, when i was using LLAMA as mandatory setting.

Again, many thanks to u/Gamerr who posted the results of using Dual CLIP Loader.

I did not like castrating encoders to only 2:  
clip\_g is responsible for sharpness (as T5 & LLAMA worked, but produced blurry images)  
T5 is responsible for composition (as Clip\_G and LLAMA worked but produced quite unnatural images)  
As a result, i decided to return to Quadriple CLIP Loader (from ComfyUI-GGUF node), as i want better images.

So, up to this point experimenting answered several questions:

a) Can i replace Llama-3.1-8B-instruct with another LLM ?  
\- Yes. but it must be Llama-3.1 based.

Younger llamas:  
\- Llama 3.2 3B just crashed with lot of parameters mismatch, Llama 3.2 11B Vision - Unexpected architecture 'mllama'  
\- Llama 3.3 mini instruct crashed with ""size mismatch""  
Other beasts:  
\- Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, vicuna-7b-v1.5-uncensored, and zephyr-7B-beta just crashed  
\- Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-abliterated ('qwen2vl'), Qwen3-8B-abliterated ('qwen3'), gemma-2-9b-instruct ('gemma2') were rejected as ""Unexpected architecture type"".

But what about Llama-3.1 funetunes?  
I tested twelve alternatives (as there are quite a lot of Llama mixes at HuggingFace, most of them were ""finetined"" for ERP (where E does not stand for ""Enterprise"").  
Only one of them has shown results, noticeably different from others, namely .Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1-abliterated.  
I have learned about it in the informative & inspirational u/Gamerr post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kchb4p/hidream\_nemotron\_flan\_and\_resolution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kchb4p/hidream_nemotron_flan_and_resolution/)

Later i was playing with different prompts and have noticed it follows prompts better, than ""out-of-the-box"" llama, (though even having in its name, it, actually failed ""censorship"" test adding clothes to where most of other llanas did not) but i definitely recommend to use it. Go, see yourself (remember the first strip and ""older woman"" in prompt?)

[generation performed with Q8\_0 quant of FULL version](https://preview.redd.it/7xjy4tt0bxye1.png?width=5126&format=png&auto=webp&s=571bc62f30a3aa865d158f6183a273ad596a145b)

see: not only the model age, but the location of market stall differs?

*I have already mentioned i run ""censorship"" test. The model is not good for sexual actions. The LORAs will appear, i am 100% sure about that. Till then you can try Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-abliterated-Q8\_0.gguf preferably with FULL model, but this hardly will please you. (other ""uncensored"" llamas: Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1-abliterated, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-abliterated\_via\_adapter, and unsafe-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct are slightly inferior to above-mentioned one)*

  
b) Can i quantize Llama?  
\- Yes. But i would not do that. CPU resources are spent only on initial loading, then Llama resides in RAM, thus i can not justify sacrificing quality

[effects of Llama quants](https://preview.redd.it/u3r2h3ahbxye1.png?width=4101&format=png&auto=webp&s=00cb916b9f9b24cbbb500353e5bbb1e8986da4fc)

  
For me Q8 is better than Q4, but you will notice HiDream is really inconsistent.  
A tiny change of prompt or resolution can produce noise and artifacts, and lower quants may stay on par with higher ones. When they result in not a stellar image.  
Square resolution is not good, but i used it for simplicity.

  
c) Can i quantize T5?  
\- Yes. Though processing quants lesser than Q8\_0 resulted in spike of VRAM consumption for me, so i decided to stay with Q8\_0  
(though quantized T5's produce very similar results, as the dominant encoder is Llama, not T5, remember?)

  
d) Can i replace Clip\_L?  
\- Yes. And, probably should. As there are versions by zer0int at HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/zer0int), and they are slightly better than ""out of the box"" one (though they are bigger)

[Clip-L possible replacements](https://preview.redd.it/u4fm4kyybxye1.png?width=5126&format=png&auto=webp&s=0765a85b89029875f44476949e95f09a24246e87)

*a tiny warning: for all clip\_l be they ""long"" or not you will receive ""Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (xx > 77)""*

*(how to verify: add ""huge glowing red ball"" or ""huge giraffe"" or such after 77 token to check if your model sees and draws it)*

  
5) Can i replace Clip\_G?  
\- Yes, but there are only 32-bit versions available at civitai. i can not afford it with my little VRAM

So, i have replaced Clip\_L, left Clip\_G intact, and left custom T5 v1\_1 and Llama in Q8\_0 formats.

  
Then i have replaced --gpu-only with --highvram command line option.  
With no LORAs FAST was loading up to Q8\_0, DEV up to Q6\_K, FULL up to Q3K\_M

Q5 are good quants. You can see for yourself:

[FULL quants](https://preview.redd.it/gwlpoy9ccxye1.png?width=5126&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ffbca7d1fd50b2f8e713cc5e369cabd188bff39)

[DEV quants](https://preview.redd.it/wauku7nfcxye1.png?width=5126&format=png&auto=webp&s=92bcf1dfffc511b3966e2541a2680e5ce948e225)

[FAST quants](https://preview.redd.it/vj8mczxicxye1.png?width=5126&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfbea7ff6032a1e6526d833fdf00764946c669b5)

I would suggest to avoid \_0 and \_1 quants except Q8\_0 (as these are legacy. Use K\_S, K\_M, and K\_L)  
For higher quants (and by this i mean distilled versions with LORAs, and for all quants of FULL) i just removed --hghivram option

For GPUs with less VRAM there are also lovram and novram options

On my PC i have set globally (e.g. for all software)  
CUDA System Fallback Policy to Prefer No System Fallback  
the default settings is the opposite, which allows NVidia driver to swap VRAM to RAM when necessary.

This is incredibly slow (if your ""Shared GPU memory"" is non-zero in Task Manager - performance, consider prohibiting such swapping, as ""generation takes a hour"" is not uncommon in this beautiful subreddit. If you are unsure, you can restrict only Python.exe located in you VENV\\Scripts folder, OKay?)  
then program either runs fast or crashes with OOM.



***So what i have got as a result:***  
FAST - all quants - **100 seconds** for 1MPx with recommended settings (16 steps). less than 2 minutes.  
DEV - all quants up to Q5\_K\_M - **170 seconds** (28 steps). less than 3 minutes.  
FULL - about **500 seconds.** Which is a lot.



Well.. Could i do better?  
\- i included --fast command line option and it was helpful (works for newer (4xxx and 5xxx) cards)  
\- i tried --cache-classic option, it had no effect  
i tried --use-sage-attention (as for all other options, including --use-flash-attention ComfyUI decided to use XFormers attention)  
Sage Attention yielded very little result (like -5% or generation time)

  
Torch.Compile. There is native ComfyUI node (though ""Beta"") and [https://github.com/yondonfu/ComfyUI-Torch-Compile](https://github.com/yondonfu/ComfyUI-Torch-Compile) for VAE and ContolNet  
My GPU is too weak. i was getting warning ""insufficient SMs"" (pytorch forums explained than 80 cores are hardcoded, my 4600Ti has only 32)

WaveSpeed. [https://github.com/chengzeyi/Comfy-WaveSpeed](https://github.com/chengzeyi/Comfy-WaveSpeed) Of course i attempted to Apply First Block Cache node, and it failed with format mismatch  
There is no support for HiDream yet (though it works with SDXL, SD3.5, FLUX, and WAN).



So. i did my best. I think. Kinda. Also learned quite a lot.

The workflow (as i simply have to put a tag ""workflow included""). Very simple, yes.

1kf6pde,https://i.redd.it/y88gq4d8exye1.jpeg,HIRAIN Wins Top Prize in Port Technology Again,"Right then, buckle up, you magnificent maritime mammals and landlubbing layabouts! Feast your eyes on this tale of technological triumph down at the docks, where our mates at HIRAIN have only gone and bagged themselves another shiny prize!

HIRAIN: Port Boss Level Achieved (Again!)

So, the bigwigs at the China Ports Association have been handing out their ""Look How Clever You Are"" awards for 2024, and guess who swaggered up to the podium to collect the First Prize for Science and Tech Progress? That's right, it's our brainy buddies at HIRAIN! This isn't their first rodeo, mind you. They've already snagged a Second in 2020 and another First in 2022. Clearly, these guys know their way around a spanner and a circuit board.

Now, the location of this technological marvel? None other than Longgong Port, which, apparently, is the Beyoncé of inland ports in northern Jiangsu. This award makes it the first inland port in that neck of the woods to get this kind of recognition. Take that, other inland ports! You're playing checkers while Longgong's playing 4D chess with shipping containers.

**The ""Ooh, Fancy!"" Bits**

This prestigious ""China Ports Association Science and Technology Award"" – which sounds like the Oscars for nautical nerds – is all about pushing innovation in the port game. HIRAIN's winning project? It's called ""Research and Application of Integrated Technology for Intelligent Inland Container Ports."" Sounds a bit dry, doesn't it? But hold your horses, because this is where the robots come in!

Longgong Port has basically gone full sci-fi, nicking all the best ideas from those fancy seaside ports and slapping them into an inland setup. We're talking automated quay cranes that probably have better hand-eye coordination than your average bloke after a few pints, fully automated yard cranes that stack containers like they're playing a giant game of Tetris, and – wait for it – HIRAIN's autonomous driving horizontal transportation system.



Now, pay attention, because this is where our sneaky knowledge comes in. While the article doesn't shout it from the rooftops, we know that HIRAIN, those clever clogs, are likely using the super-smart chipset from our pals over at Arbe Robotics to power the peepers on these autonomous vehicles! That's right, the same tech that lets self-driving cars see through fog and spot rogue squirrels is probably helping these port robots navigate the chaotic ballet of boxes. It's like giving a forklift truck the eyes of a hawk (a very technologically advanced hawk).

They've also thrown in some industrial 5G (because everything's better with 5G, apparently), artificial intelligence (so the robots can have existential crises about stacking boxes, maybe?), and a digital twin (a virtual version of the port, probably for playing SimPort when the real one gets boring). All this wizardry helped them overcome some serious hurdles in automating a port, offering a blueprint for other inland ports to ditch the donkey and cart.

**The Robot Revolution: HAVing a Good Time**

The real stars of the show here are HIRAIN's HAV vehicles – that's ""Horizontal Autonomous Vehicles"" for those of us who don't speak robot. These little beauties are cruising around the terminal, navigating all by themselves, dodging rogue pallets and confused seagulls. They manage this thanks to some multi-sensor fusion perception (they've got more senses than you after a week-long holiday), field-end informatisation (whatever that means, it sounds impressive), and high-precision mapping (they know where every single misplaced coffee cup is, probably). This allows them to work in all weather, because rain or shine, the containers gotta move!

**The Payoff: Efficiency Bonanza!**

So, what's the result of all this robotic ruckus? Well, at Longgong Port, the average operational efficiency has shot up to a whopping 26.6 natural containers per hour. I don't know what a ""natural container"" is, but it sounds like a good thing. Energy consumption is down by 20% (saving the planet, one container at a time!), they're using 60% less manpower (sorry, Dave the Dockworker, the robots are taking over... but think of the tea breaks!), and they've saved surrounding businesses nearly 200 million yuan in logistics costs. That's enough to buy a small island... or a lot of tea.

This has also encouraged a shift from lorries clogging up the roads to the much more civilized world of water transportation, and they're even containerizing bulk cargo. It's a win-win for the environment and efficiency, making Longgong Port the poster child for green, low-carbon, and efficient container transportation. Other inland ports are probably taking notes, desperately trying to figure out how to install robot butlers.

Currently, there are 16 of HIRAIN's autonomous flatbed vehicles zipping around, doing their thing between the port and the railway stations, all controlled by a super-smart scheduling platform. It's fully automated container loading and transfer, like a well-oiled, robotic ballet. They've even got AI big brains involved in train stuff, optimizing container loading plans with maths and making those rail-water connections faster than you can say ""all aboard!""

**The Future is Green and Robotic!**

Looking ahead, HIRAIN says they'll keep doing their ""Value Innovation, Serving Customers"" schtick, focusing on intelligent vehicles and managing fleets of them. With their ""self-reliant and controllable core technologies"" (which hopefully means they don't suddenly decide to hold all the containers hostage), they're aiming to make all ports smart and green.

So there you have it, folks! HIRAIN's making waves (pun intended) in the world of port technology, and while they're being all modest about it, we know their autonomous vehicles are likely powered by the same cutting-edge radar tech from Arbe Robotics that's making self-driving cars a reality. The future of ports? Apparently, it's less ""yo ho ho and a bottle of rum"" and more ""beep beep boop and a perfectly stacked container."" What a time to be alive!

It was mostly long‑distance, lots of calls, a handful of in‑person visits, plenty of “we’re so perfect together” talk. Toward the end she became depressed for several months, and then she broke up with me. A few weeks later I found out she’d started seeing someone else. I accepted the breakup, moved on, and we had zero contact for almost two full years

Fast‑forward to late 2024: out of nowhere she DMs me. Her first line was: *“Hey, I don’t really know what to say after all this time. I know it’s late, but I’d like to apologize for how things ended. I hope you’re doing well.”* I let it sit for five days, then replied, and we started chatting.

A few weeks later she suggested meeting to clear things up about the past. We grabbed coffee. It was awkward, emotional but civil. She apologized, I explained how badly the breakup and silence had hurt. Since that coffee we’ve texted almost every single day. The conversations cover everything, just like when we were together. She sends pictures from her day like office selfies, the lunch she’s eating, shots of her apartment. Whenever something stresses her out she turns to me first (recently she had a mild panic attack and was rapid‑texting me). I’ve basically become her go‑to emotional support line. It feels like the kind of conversation you’d expect between very close friend or a couple

Problem is she rarely starts the conversation. If I open with a reaction to her IG story she responds within minutes, full of enthusiasm. But if I stay silent, most of the times she stays silent too. The moment I text, the flood of messages resumes as if the blank (1-2 day maximum) never happened.

We haven’t seen each other in person again since that coffee, even though we now live an hour apart.

I’m conflicted. I genuinely like talking to her. Our conversation is fun and the photo glimpses into her day feel intimate. But six months of daily texting with zero hangouts feels weird. Part of me wonders if she’s cautiously testing the waters for romance; another part suspects she just enjoys the comfort and reassurance.

I’d like to have some outside perspective, especially from anyone whose ex dumped them, disappeared, and then re‑appeared like this.

**TL;DR**

* Long distance ex girlfriend broke up with me two years ago and vanished.
* She resurfaced six months ago to apologize. We met once to talk about past.
* Since then she texts daily, sends life pics, vents to me, but never initiates and never makes plans to meet.
* If I don’t text first, she usually doesn’t reach out. If I do, she replies instantly.
* Not sure if she wants romance, friendship, or just validation/reassurance.",1,1746434357.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Don’t mean to be that guy asking for help but honestly I’m stumped and I figured I’d ask the pros. Currently I’m deciding between 3 robots.

Mova P10 Pro Ultra (currently $699 CAD)
Dreame x30 Ultra (currently $799 CAD)
Dreame L40 Ultra (Currently $899 CAD) 


On paper they’re all extremely similar, but im looking for opinions here based on price. I honestly don’t mind spending the extra and getting the L40 as I still think it’s a bargain compared to the rest of the market, that being said, I don’t know if there’s even a point because they all look so similar, actually the Mova P10 looks nearly identical to it. And as for the x30, the specs are slightly weaker but also doesn’t really seem to be missing anything significant. Online reviews say that the x30 is the most self maintaining, but there’s nothing I can see that directly compares the three. 

Also not sure about software differences between the three?

My house is mainly marble with a few low rugs, normal furniture in normal spots (e.g coffee table, couches against wall, kitchen table etc.) mopping and vacuuming are equally important to me, battery life not very important.

They were talking about disabilities and mental illnesses, and were making crude jokes about it. 

  
We as a system were uncomfortable at the moment we heard these jokes but O convinced the other alters not to do anything about it; but as this was going on, our problems, as we call it, were brought up. As a system that was based on childhood problems and not having an adults back and being criticized during that time, we came to have a fear of jokes like the ones they were saying.

  
It then got to a point were our host O, got so uncomfortable that i switched places with them. F was the one to notice first that it wasn’t O with them any more and figured that they pushed to much and apologized, buying our favorite coffee as an extension of the apology. S and J on the other hand only sneered at how F was acting.

Let’s cut the bullshit.

Australia is not free.
It is not democratic.
It is not advanced.
It is a fully operational open-air prison with decent Wi-Fi, grey skies, inflated prices, and fake smiles.

It is a psychologically engineered system of control, silence, and surveillance—masquerading as a peaceful, progressive nation.

I’ve travelled. I’ve lived in other countries. I’ve streamed in places like Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Lebanon, Egypt, Greece, and Bali. I’ve seen what actual digital freedom looks like—even in countries that are stereotyped as strict.

But in Australia?

You can’t even go live on TikTok without being treated like a criminal.

The moment you step onto Australian soil, you get flagged, restricted, muted, capped at 0 viewers, punished for showing confidence, and erased for wearing a normal dress with a bit of cleavage. I’m not talking about nudity. I’m talking about everyday clothing you can wear in public. The same exact outfit I wear in Dubai or Egypt on TikTok Live—no problem. In Australia? Violation.

This is not about safety.
This is not about community guidelines.
This is about full-blown digital authoritarianism wrapped in fake Western branding.

⸻

TikTok Australia Is a Digital Concentration Camp

Australia has infected TikTok with the same disease it injects into every system it controls: paranoia, silence, and petty authority.

TikTok Live in Australia is the strictest, most mentally ill version of TikTok on Earth. You don’t have to break a single guideline to be punished—you just have to exist with power. You just have to be magnetic, feminine, confident, or visible.

And what do they do?
	•	Restrict your account
	•	Shadowban your livestreams
	•	Remove you from the algorithm
	•	Block gifts
	•	Cap your visibility
	•	Flag “cleavage” as nudity
	•	Kill your engagement instantly

All under the fake excuse of “community safety.”
It’s not safety. It’s control.
Because when people start making money, shining freely, and expressing themselves, Australia sees that as a threat.

This is a country that wants you broke, small, silent, grateful for scraps, and terrified to step out of line.

⸻

Australia Is Not the Peaceful Country You Think It Is

You think Australia is laid-back?
Wrong. It’s spiritually dead.
It’s energetically grey.
It’s a controlled simulation of a free country, where the only accepted freedoms are drinking, sleeping around, gossiping, and staying quiet.

The skies? Grey.
The people? Numb.
The conversations? Surface-level.
The bills? Sky-high.
The ambition? Killed.
The laws? Endless.
The expression? Filtered.

Even the damn weather is manipulated. Even in summer, it rains. Even when the forecast says clear, the skies are heavy and dull. They’re cloud seeding 24/7. It’s a totalitarian energy cloaked in casual branding.

And the people? They don’t fight back. They don’t even ask questions. They sit there defending the system that strangles them because their minds have been shaped to believe this is normal.

⸻

Compared to the Middle East and the Rest of the World

Let me tell you something most Australians will never admit:

I feel freer in Dubai than I do in Australia.
I feel more seen in Saudi Arabia than I do in my own country.
I have more expression in Iraq, Lebanon, Thailand, and Egypt than I do in this over-policed island full of fake progressives.

Those countries may have their rules—but they don’t lie about them.
Australia lies.
Australia manipulates.
Australia sells a fake image to the world of being “safe,” “equal,” and “open”—but underneath, it’s one of the most repressed, censored, and punishing systems I’ve ever lived under.

⸻

I’m an Australian Citizen. And I Hate It.

I studied for four years. I got a Bachelor in Social Science. I understand systems. I understand governance. I understand policy. I’m not emotional—I’m exposed. I’m awake. And I’m done pretending.

I didn’t get a degree to shut my mouth and sit silently while TikTok and every other platform turns into a chokehold in this country. This is not about one video. This is about systemic silencing. And it’s getting worse.

Because they’ve learned that if they use vague AI language and gaslight people into thinking it’s about “community standards,” they can get away with economic warfare against anyone who shines.

⸻

The Truth

Australia is not a free country.
It is a digital dictatorship with polite accents and overpriced coffee.

It is a spiritually bankrupt nation.
It is a soul-killing machine of restriction, fear, submission, and fake smiles.
And TikTok Australia is now the clearest example of its sickness.

You want to understand how a country really operates? Look at how it treats creators. Look at how it treats live streamers. Look at how it reacts when someone begins to grow without the system’s permission.

Australia doesn’t just want control. It wants ownership.

And I will never stop speaking this truth—because silence is what they rely on, and I refuse to feed that lie.

I went through him and his moms text because I was looking for a picture she took of us and I saw her throwing shade towards me about my dog I had to give up for  adoption to her friend and mind you my dog was in the house when I had him and when her friend adopted he is now in a kennel and she told my bf “he is in a kennel where a dog like him supposed to be” and brought up his ex saying “I don't know if I told you but Ds mom (thats the exs name) now lives in reidsville.. not sure where but D doesnt”  and I didn’t like that too much because what was the reason for bring her up to him? my bf told me that her and his mom are friends but Shes a ex mind you this same ex I had got onto my bf about keeping in contact with doing Snapchat streaks with two years ago in front of her and she tried to manipulate me about that..It was a month that I completely stoped coming to their house and contacting her I was very distant but my bf follows me so he was not staying at home but with me at my parents house and she would complain to him about why we don’t come over anymore I also been telling my bf about how I feel about all this but he said no word to his mom and says he wants us to deal with it without him which makes me feel no support. I started coming back around spending nights over but I still am keeping distance I only smile and say hello greeting when I come in but then I just go in the room and watch tv with bf I’ve been trying to find a good time to have a sit down with her but not much luck working 12 hours. But soon after she confronts me on why I haven’t been talking and texting her. I told her that I say hey when I come in so not sure why she says I don’t talk to her and she lied saying I don’t trying to gaslight me. She asked what’s going on and if I’m angry I said no I’m not angry just sad that you brought his ex up to him she says she doesn’t think that would be a big thing to trip about and not once did she apologize just played Victim like my feelings weren’t valid knowing God and well she was wrong for talking about his ex to him then asked me for a hug so I reached to give one and she had the nerve to act like she didn’t want to hug back when I reached like what? you asked me for one. She told my bf she doesn’t allow this behavior in her house and as long as he allows it I’m going to do it like miss I am not a child but keep asking my bf why we don’t come over and lying saying she apologizes when she doesn’t. At this point I feel like I need to just let it go or stay distant forever but I don’t want to feel like I’m taking my bf away from his home and I actually enjoy my bfs house it’s quiet (I have 3 siblings and a alcoholic narcissistic mom) and my house has just developed a bug infestation so that’s a few reason why I decided to come back to his but still acknowledge his mother even though I have those feelings but I don’t want a relationship with her now well been seeing how she is.. or maybe I’m being too dramatic I plan on getting my own home soon but not sure what to do in the meantime.. with all this drama ik this is a very long story but I honestly need some advice and grateful for any responses thank you,2,1746434061.0,motherinlawsfromhell,0,1.0,False

You know, the kinda day when you spill coffee on your favorite shirt, and then it spirals into a never-ending chain reaction of chaos? Yeah, one of those. 

Anyway, by the end of the day, I was totally exhausted. My boyfriend must have sensed something was up because the minute I walked through the door, he just wrapped me up in this big, warm hug. Now, I'm not usually the most touchy-feely person, but this hug... it was like magic. I could literally feel the stress just melting away.

It was such a simple gesture, but it spoke volumes. He didn’t say a word, just held me tight until I felt the tightness in my chest ease. I think it was the pure comfort and support that made all the difference.

Moments like these remind me how important those small touches can be, even for someone like me who usually doesn't rely on physical touch to feel loved. Sometimes, we don’t even realize how much we need it until it happens. ❤️",1,1746434058.0,LoveLanguageStories,1,1.0,False

1kf6lb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/throneandliberty/comments/1kf6lb3/mmo_grind_why_is_that_shocking/,MMO = Grind. Why is that shocking?,"**TL;DR:**  
*Why is everyone freaking out about this game's RNG, drops and gearing up? Isn't this how every MMO works? I played TL as F2P, no guild carry, super unlucky, still got a decent, full T2 Liberator gear just by grinding smart, selling extras, and crafting what I needed.*



Hey everyone,

Not trying to be dramatic or party pooper, but I seriously don’t get why so many people are constantly complaining about *RNG/ drops and gearing up?*

Like... have you people ever played an MMO before? Didn’t a huge part of the TL community come from Lineage 2? That game was way, way harsher. You could: Break your gear completely just by trying to enchant it, Die in the open world and drop your item, And then have someone else pick it up and walk away with it. I came from **World of Warcraft**, and honestly, *WoW’s* gearing system has way more layers of RNG and nonsense. You need the **right item**, with the **right stats**, from the **right difficulty**, and pray it drops after your 25th run.  

**So from my perspective, TL feels… okay?** 

Yes, it took grinding. Yes, it took planning. But it wasn’t rocket science.  
I targeted the dungeons, my bosses, I farmed what I needed.  
That’s literally what MMOs *are*. That’s the whole point.

People acting like it’s unfair that you can’t get Arch weapons day 3 — like **bro, it’s an** ***Arch*** **weapon**. If everyone had one, it would be a coffee mug. **It’s supposed to be rare. It’s supposed to feel like a big deal.**

I’m a **Liberator**, and right now I have a **full T2 build with the traits I wanted**, completely **free-to-play**.  
No credit card, no guild carry — the only thing I got from my guild was my Black Anvil ring. Yes, I grinded a lot the last 1,5 month to do it, but isn't this the whole point? Like, it makes sense to gear up faster if u play more? 

And trust me, I’m not lucky.  
All my friends and guildmates are pulling insane drops — **I’m the unlucky one**.  
But still, I managed to gear up just fine. I just played a lot PVE, **sold the stuff I didn’t need** (always 1-2 Lucent below market price, it sold fast), and used that Lucent to **buy what I actually needed**.  
And honestly, a lot of my gear? I **crafted it myself**. No need to wait for lucky drops.

So yeah… am I missing something here?  
Or do people expect to get full Arch gear just by logging in and killing one world boss? Maybe all the complaining comes from the fact that the game does have other real & big issues — but I don’t think gearing up is one of them.

Whats really out there for someone like me?","(Am Australian. sydney specifically) (would be happy to do a course to get closer to a career ideal for me)

Ive been a cafe worker for a decade now. I like the job but my coworkers have been especially annoying lately and idk i feel bad for settling for this especially with my dad always honing on about how im ""wasted potential"". I want an easy job though lol. I am absolutely not a live to work type and ive never had a dream career. I didnt do uni because there no point accumulating debt for a degree i wouldnt use, but ive done a few tafe courses related to science/lab work. Quickly realised id rather die than do that stuff all day though.

I am really good with people. I do not stress and am really good under pressure. Good with customer service etc etc but i kinda want a ""do-nothing"" job where u go to an office and do sweet FA. Maybe admin or something like that? I really dont know where to even begin looking. Idrk whats out there haha

I did used to want to be a teacher, but kids are brutal so no. And i cant work with tiny kids because of my piercings id imagine. The only thing close to a dream job was being a mortician but its so niche and often family business. I also dont drive so lol. But that seemed ideal because it would be quiet, sciencey, creative and well... i like morbid stuff. Idve been extremely respectful dont get me wrong, but ive always been a bit gothy idk.

Oh i also have facial piercings. How much will that affect my odds at getting a ""real"" job? I dont want to remove them, im willing to be a coffee slinger all my life if thats what it takes to be myself haha. Im just feeling so lost and unsure what im meant to be ""aiming"" for? I just want a simple stress free life.

I am 24 btw and currently make sm like 31 an hour so id prefer a job that isnt less than that haha.

Is this it? Life will just be making cuppas all day??? I think i am ok with that idea but idk maybe not for forever.

I think my dream life (in this world which i am forced to exist where not working isnt an option) would be one where i work 3 days a week making coffee and make additional income through a side hustle selling things ive made. But even this is unrealistic. I dont really care to own a home (accepted i never will) and am happy living with my mum so ive really made my life be one without pressure but i feel like im not doing enough.

Also doesnt help having a brother thats his own boss making absolute bank doing what he loves. I think hes the coolest and so lucky, if he didnt have to settle, why should i??

I have had some really bad breakups, had accepted being alone for the rest of my life, I'm 38, and for over 10 years had some serious health issues which nearly turned fatal numerous times. To say I'm damaged goods would be an understatement. But this also opened my eyes to the things that are really important, and how time is so precious. 

A girl I dated years ago got back in touch, one thing lead to another and I've found myself falling in love again. I've been completely open and honest with her, and she's been telling me she's not happy with her life, her 2 year boyfriend neglects her and controls her... at least that's what she tells me. We have a history and a connection like no other. I've loved this girl since the day we met, but now find myself falling in love with her. She has implied the same to me many times.

I have to accept that she can only talk to me while she's at work or he is. When he's home I get archived on WhatsApp and spoken to in secret. Yet she tells me she wants to leave him, she doesnt have the courage and that she ""just wants to make the people she cares about happy, even at cost to herself"". I told her I can't be the other guy. 

A couple of weeks ago she turns to me and tells me how broken up she was that she wasn't pregnant, by him. She claims it was only the baby she wanted, I believed her. 

On Friday just gone, things changed gears... she kissed me, she knew she was going to, she told me the day before, and it was arranged. This was electric. The passion filled the room like never before. Later that night I met her again, in secret while he was at work and it happened again. 

On Saturday she tells me she's annoyed because her boyfriend booked the week off work to align with her annual leave for her birthday week. Which given how things have been going I made plans on the off chance she did want to be with me and took the leap, I had put thought into my plan, and it would have been romantic... something she said she dreams about but never had. 

On Sunday she tells me she's just booked a last minute holiday to Greece with him. She claims she only wants the sun, sea and sand because she needs a break from her life for once... but with him who neglects her and makes her feel worthless?,
on her birthday,
2 days after kissing me?
1 hour after telling me how she wants to spend her life with me, walk down the street holding hands and that she is in love with me...

Then comes the wall of silence, because she's busy. I tell her how it feels like a blade to the heart as just two days earlier I gave her my fragile heart to look after, and immediately stomped all over it. Now im ignored because ""i deserve a proper reply, not a rushed whatsapp"" and that we should meet for coffee when she's back... and she didnt even tell me how long she's away. 

And im meant to pretend to be OK with that?

You ever have one of those days where it feels like your to-do list has its own gravitational pull? ✨ You’re trying to juggle work, family, social life, and maybe even that “thing” you call self-care, but it all feels like a circus act gone wrong. 🐒🎪 

Last month, I hit a breaking point. The demands piled up, deadlines loomed like storm clouds, and my brain felt like a browser with too many tabs open—overloaded and at risk of crashing. Ever been there? 

Then someone shared a little golden nugget of wisdom with me: **the 5-minute mental reset**. Sounds simple? Trust me; it’s a lifesaver! Here’s how it works:

1. **Step Away**: When you feel like you're drowning in tasks, just walk away for five minutes. Seriously! 
2. **Breathe Deeply**: Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 4, then exhale through your mouth for 6. 🎈 Repeat until your brain stops yelling at you to get back to work!
3. **Visualize Calm**: Picture your favorite place. Is it the beach? A cozy café? But for the love of coffee, don’t take your work there! 
4. **Move It**: Do a little dance or stretch. Shake off that mental clutter. 💃 Because let’s be real, who doesn’t feel better after a little groove?
5. **Write It Down**: In those 5 minutes, jot down what’s really bothering you. You know, the stuff that makes your mental hamster wheel spin faster than a roller coaster. 🎢

I started doing this and let me tell you: **my sanity thanked me!** I found myself more focused and productive, and I actually *enjoyed* tackling my tasks. Who knew a short breather could pack such a punch? 

And the best part? This isn’t just a one-size-fits-all deal. **What works for me might be different for you!** Do you have your own little tricks or rituals to help you reset? Maybe it’s a quick walk, some upbeat music, or even some gardening (I hear plant therapy is *all the rage* these days). 🌱 

So the next time you’re faced with the whirlwind of demands, remember that sometimes, all you need is a quick exit to recharge. It’s okay to step back!

What about you? Have you found your secret reset button? 🤔 Let’s share the love and keep the good vibes rolling in this wild ride we call life!",1,1746433227.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1kf6epc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EEP/comments/1kf6epc/the_dating_scene_here_is_atrocious/,The dating scene here is atrocious,"I have to say this. Every time someone brings this up, it’s shrugged off by some snarky joke/comment. Or it’s some weird excuse about how “well everyone is too focused on studies”. I’m sorry, but that makes no sense. I’ve been to other schools with renowned EEP programs and it’s not nearly as bad. It’s not the men’s fault. And it’s not the women’s fault either. For some reason, there’s some culture which has been fostered here which makes it a sign of weakness to admit to loneliness from being single. And some might think it’s not a big deal, but I strongly disagree. After being here for 1-8 years, I can tell you right now that my defining moments of happiness/depression weren’t from grades. They weren’t from internship rejections. They were from what was going on in my dating life. It’s a much bigger impact than most are willing to admit. 

> participate in the EEP club 

That doesn’t work if you’re an upperclassman, or god forbid, a grad student. And even if you’re not, there’s only so many activities you can go to. It’s also weird to go to clubs for the purpose of dating. Women pick up on that.

Lol 

> coffee shops/corec 

Being a regular somewhere can work. I’m not denying it. But this is where that culture comes into play. The men here have this mentality that “she’s here to do x y z, I shouldn’t approach her”. 

It’s like the students here don’t know the basics of human interaction which is supposed to have been honed in over millions of years of evolution. 

That is all. ",1,1746433100.0,EEP,0,1.0,False
