for context, just before receiving it, we were using a hand me down single serve keurig and getting 120 k cups from costco for $50 ... giving it back or telling my parents about it being too expensive isnt rly an option. for now, we've settled on using the keurig for the days we go to work, and the Nespresso when we're home and can actually sit calmly and enjoy the upgraded coffee. besides, we still have some pods to go through.

i know there is no such thing as third party vertuo pods, but are there any other budget options?? any sales that happen regularly? is it cheaper to buy directly from their site?? 

we're canadian (QC) btw so USA deals wouldnt apply, i assume.

It was a shopping order and I did everything right. I had a substitution and I substituted for the 12oz coffee because the 10oz the ordered wasn’t even anywhere on the shelf. They sent me a message after I had checked out and left the store saying they couldn’t use the coffee. I was going to return it and refund it, but I realized I couldn’t. I explained to the customers son I guess. I also had to verify I was at the right address because their notes had two different addresses in it, which weren’t even the delivery address listed. Nobody answered the message, or the call. I had to ring the door and wait for their son to come out… anyways, they took $10 off the tip 😩. It’s really not even my fault. They didn’t say anything until I had already left the store. ",1,1768265870.0,Sparkdriver,0,1.0,False

About me: 
•D-tier digital artist, I keep taking long breaks whenever i get back into the swing of things oops. i do very basic cute animal doodles mostly. 

•lover of exotic pets—i have a parrot, a leopard gecko, and a hamster. I've owned various freshwaters fish tanks, frogs, guinea pigs, beetles, small birds, and hope to adopt some mice or rats someday. if anyone has any exotics I'd love to see!
I wouldn't mind receiving dog and cat pics, i think they're cute but they're just not for me.

•lover of cute things—i've cut down on my collection of plushies drastically, but i have a lot still...I have a lot of cute trinkets, lately I've become inclined to add more pink in my wardrobe, and just generally like anything ""cutesy"" even if I'm ""too old"" for it.

•random ""crafty"" hobby collector—i usually only dabble in it briefly and then quit when i'm not immediately perfect at my first attempt LOL. I've made a few needle-felted abominations, but I want to give it another go someday.
I have like 8-ish colouring books, and want to get back into journalling.
I also do very simple beadwork, like bead bracelets and I made a bead plant last weekend LOL. It's an expensive hobby. 😭

•i have some mental health problems (anxiety, depression) and I understand some other ppl do too. 
It's something we can discuss lightly once a relationship is established, but I'm not looking for a free therapist nor am I looking to be one.

•i play some single player games, typically old games from my childhood or random indie games i find.
i want to play more horror games when it's not dark out outside LOL i'm a chicken shit 

Other things I like are: thrifting, going on walks, coffee, craft fairs, just seeing people's homemade stuff tbh.

1qbd3vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoRVing/comments/1qbd3vy/free_printable_rv_pretrip_checklist_laminate_this/,Free printable RV pre-trip checklist (laminate this - you'll use it every time),"I've worked in the RV industry for 10+ years - parts, service, tech, management. I've seen the same preventable problems come through over and over. So I put together a comprehensive pre-trip checklist covering everything from tire pressure to emergency toilets to why you need garlic.



Print it. Laminate it. Use a grease pencil to check things off. Wipe clean after every trip.



This is everything I wish someone had given me when I started.



\---



\## \*\*BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE DRIVEWAY\*\*



\### \*\*TIRES - CHECK FIRST:\*\*

\- Tire pressure (check sidewall + yellow safety sticker)

\- Visual inspection (cracks, bulges, damage)

\- Tread depth

\- Lug nuts tight



\*\*Yellow sticker location:\*\* Door frame (motorhome), tongue of trailer (driver/off-door side), or beside/behind driver seat (motorhome)



\---



\### \*\*WATER SYSTEMS:\*\*

\- Fresh water: FEW GALLONS ONLY (not full)

\- Gray water: DRAINED

\- Black water: DRAINED & FLUSHED

\- Hot water heater: DRAINED



\*\*Why this matters:\*\* Travel trailers and 5th wheels aren't designed to travel with full tanks. Water sloshing = broken mounting straps. It's in your manual. Don't be the manure spreader on I-75, I-10, or Route 66.



\---



\### \*\*EXTERIOR WALK-AROUND:\*\*

\- Awning retracted

\- Slides retracted

\- \*\*TV antenna DOWN\*\* (don't take out a bridge)

\- All compartments closed/latched

\- Propane secured

\- No leaks

\- All lights working



\---



\### \*\*HITCH/TOW (Trailers):\*\*

\- Hitch properly seated/locked

\- Safety chains attached (crossed)

\- Breakaway cable connected

\- Electrical connected & tested

\- Tongue jack UP



\---



\### \*\*PETS:\*\*

\*\*NEVER travel with pets in the trailer/5th wheel while towing.\*\*



Why: No climate control, temperature extremes, carbon monoxide risk, they're trapped if something goes wrong.



Pets go in the tow vehicle with you. Proper crate/carrier with climate control. They're family - treat them like it. They wouldn't do this to you if they could talk.



\---



\## \*\*TOOL KIT - WHAT TO PACK\*\*



\### \*\*ELECTRICAL:\*\*

\- Digital multimeter

\- Spare fuses (full set)

\- Fresh batteries

\- Screwdrivers (square, Phillips, straight, punch)



\### \*\*MECHANICAL/TOOLS:\*\*

\- Adjustable wrenches

\- Socket set - English (SAE) with 3/4"" drive

\- Socket set - Metric with 3/4"" drive

\- Electric 1/2"" impact driver (for lug nuts & hitch work)

\- Spare tire(s)

\- Extra lug nuts

\- Portable floor jack

\- Pry bar

\- Leveling blocks & wooden planks



\*\*Why both SAE and metric:\*\* RVs use both. Chassis often SAE, components often metric. Without both, you're stuck.



\*\*Why electric impact:\*\* Roadside tire change with manual wrench = miserable. Electric impact = done in 2 minutes. Worth it.



\### \*\*PLUMBING:\*\*

\- Fresh O-rings for hoses

\- Backup water filters

\- Black tank wand (for when shit goes wrong - literally)

\- Tank treatment & enzymes



\### \*\*MAINTENANCE:\*\*

\- Grease gun

\- Dry lube (for slides & jack legs - NOT wet grease)

\- Seal conditioner

\- Leaf blower (clean slide roofs before retracting)



\*\*Critical:\*\* Use DRY lube on slides and jack legs. Wet grease attracts dirt and turns into grinding paste that destroys components.



\### \*\*SAFETY/EMERGENCY:\*\*

\- First aid kit

\- Fire extinguisher

\- Flashlights (multiple) + batteries

\- Hand-crank emergency weather radio

\- Bear spray (if bear country)



\### \*\*EMERGENCY SUPPLIES:\*\*

\- 5-gallon bucket + portable throne seat (for when black tank is full at 3am)

\- Heavy-duty trash bags

\- MREs + sealed water/coffee

\- Solar generator/battery lights

\- Flannels (layers = survival)

\- Printed owner's manual



\### \*\*PROTECTION:\*\*

\- Arm-length gloves (dump station - it's YOUR shit)

\- Nitrile, rubber, and leather gloves

\- Face shield & safety glasses

\- Hand cleaner



\### \*\*MISC:\*\*

\- Tongue jack lock

\- Spare keys

\- Tech support number (written down, not just in phone)

\- Holy Bible

\- Garlic & Holy water (just in case)



\---



\## \*\*STORAGE BETWEEN TRIPS\*\*



\- All tanks drained (fresh, gray, black, hot water)

\- Black tank flushed

\- Slide mechanisms cleaned & dry-lubed

\- Jack legs cleaned & dry-lubed

\- Seals conditioned

\- Slide roofs cleaned

\- Battery maintenance



\*\*Why drain hot water heater:\*\* Stagnant water = bacteria = eggy swamp smell. Takes 5 minutes, saves your nose.



\---



\## \*\*CRITICAL NOTES\*\*



\*\*Water weight:\*\* Motorhomes are designed to travel with water. Travel trailers and 5th wheels are NOT. Don't confuse the two. Hundreds of pounds of water sloshing around during a sudden maneuver = broken mounting straps and moorings. Physics doesn't care about your convenience.



\*\*Emergency toilet:\*\* You WILL need this eventually. Full black tank at 3am, stuck on roadside, campground bathrooms closed - it happens. Be prepared.



\*\*Leaf blower for slides:\*\* Slide roofs collect leaves, dirt, pine needles, debris. If you retract slides with crap on top, it falls into the mechanism and grinds into seals. Blow it clean first. 2 minutes prevents hundreds in repairs.



\*\*Tools matter:\*\* An electric impact driver is a game changer for roadside tire changes and hitch work. Manual lug wrench in 100° heat on the shoulder of I-75 = you'll wish you spent the $100.



\---



\## \*\*THE REALITY\*\*



This seems like a lot. It is. But most fits in one or two totes, and you'll use it all eventually.



These supplies prevent:

\- Minor problems becoming major repairs

\- Uncomfortable situations becoming dangerous

\- Emergency situations becoming disasters

\- Running out of coffee (unacceptable)



The emergency toilet alone pays for itself the first time you need it.



Make the list. Get the gear. Check it before every trip.



\---



\*\*Questions welcome. I'll answer what I know from 10+ years in the industry. If I don't know something, I'll tell you straight. I won't advise on liability stuff like towing capacity - call your truck manufacturer for that.\*\*



\*\*But day-to-day RV prep and maintenance? This is what experience teaches you.\*\*",1,1768265794.0,GoRVing,0,1.0,False

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. Ive been in the news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media covered it. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

1qbd1t9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qbd1t9/my_30f_boyfriend_30m_randomly_mentioned_moving_in/,My (30f) boyfriend (30m) randomly mentioned moving in together then started to pull away emotionally,"I assumed he meant eventually in the future, as in it’s a nice idea. I told him I was also open to exploring that idea. And ever since, his actions have been feeing to me like he wants to spend less time together in general.

Even this morning, after I slept over he offered me coffee. We were enjoying it together, it was pleasant. The coffee was too hot to drink so I was waiting for it to cool. Then he started strongly hinting that he needed to walk the dog (the old dog who was still snoring in his bed) and essentially pushing me out. When I said I was just waiting for the coffee to cool and then I’d head out, he offered to put it in a to-go mug for me.

This is the third or fourth incident of this kind and when I asked to have a conversation with him about what was up or how we both were feeling about the amount of time we’re spending together, he said he was “scared to move in together” because he’d lived alone for so long and didn’t want to fuck anything up.

I’m at a loss because a) he is the one who initiated that talk unprompted, b) I explicitly said it’s a really nice idea to explore in the future but not the immediate future (we’re 4 months in…), and c) that wasn’t what I asked.

And then he said we should talk more in person and invited me over, but then didn’t talk?

I’m sensing some anxiety and some capacity issues around communication, which is disappointing to me but I realized I’m not sure where to go from here. Like how I should approach this healthily and lovingly.

Did you get interviews just from submitting your application, or did you need referrals or some kind of recruiter contact before you got traction?

The $100 Dinner And His Cheap Love
👉 CONTINUE READING 👈
Chapter 1
Ever since my husband and his mother found out I had coffee with my colleague, they've been treating me differently.

My husband, Brian Cole, slapped a bill against my face.

""Here, take this one hundred to buy groceries. My mother is coming over tonight, and I expect a proper dinner on the table.""

""There had better be fish and shrimp. And make sure the pork ribs are stewed till tender.""

I pinched the bill between my fingers, my hand shaking.

The supermarket was packed. Shrimp cost thirty-eight a pound, ribs forty-five, and even a small freshwater fish ran seventeen.

With just a hundred dollars, I couldn't even afford onions after buying the meat.

He then set me up in the family group chat by ""praising"" me, thinking it would pressure me into delivering: [My wife is the best at managing the household—a hundred bucks can cover a whole feast.]

His mother, Margaret Cole, sent a voice message, ""Don't let her skim anything. Check the receipts.""

Six o'clock in the evening. Margaret arrived.

In the middle of the table was a bowl of plain boiled pasta without even sauce on it.

Brian slammed the table and shouted, ""Where's the fish? Where's the meat? Did you give the money to your lover?""

I ripped off my apron and threw it on the floor, ""Expecting a lavish feast for a hundred bucks? This meal is just right for feeding dogs.""

***

The veins on Brian's forehead bulged, his face twisting, ""Feeding dogs? Elowen, have you lost your mind?""

He jumped to his feet, arm raised, a slap aimed straight at my face.

I stepped back and stared at him coldly, ""Go ahead. Touch me and see what happens.""

His hand froze in midair.

Margaret slammed her fork onto the table and began wailing, ""Good lord, what did we do to deserve this? My son went and married a good-for-nothing, wasteful wretch!""

""Showing such disrespect to her husband, and now she has the gall to insult me to my face!""

""My son works himself to the bone to support this family. You flirt outside over coffee, then come home and won't even cook a decent meal.""

""This is simply unbearable!""

She cried as she spoke, stealing glances at Brian to gauge his reaction.

All because I had been discussing a project with a male colleague downstairs and she happened to see us.

By the time I got home, it had turned into ironclad proof that I was unfaithful.

""Elowen, I don't hit women, but you went too far today,"" Brian said through clenched teeth, pointing at the bowl of pasta.

""One hundred bucks can't buy real food in this city? Do you think we're idiots?""

""You must have given the money to that other man!""

Margaret egged him on from the sidelines, ""Brian, check her accounts. Drag that man out.""

I looked at the absurd pair of them and laughed despite myself.

""One hundred bucks? Brian, do you really not know what things cost now, or are you pretending to be stupid?""

""Shrimp is thirty-eight, ribs forty-five. Even a slightly bigger fish costs twenty.""

""Do you want me to steal at the market, or go rob someone?""

He froze for a second, then flushed with rage.

""Shut up! How come other men's wives can manage just fine on a tight budget? Why is it excuses after excuses with you?""

""It's because your heart isn't in this family anymore.""

He stepped over the apron on the floor and closed in on me, reaching for my collar.

""Hand over your phone! I want to see your messages and your transfer records.""

""If you don't explain where that hundred went today, this isn't over.""

I slapped his hand away and looked at the man I had once loved, a hollow chill spreading through me.

We had been married three years. To protect his pride, I had never mentioned that I earned five times what he did.

The mortgage, the car payments, utilities, and all bills were on autopay from my account.

His meager salary, aside from the occasional fruit, all went straight into his mother's pocket.

And now, over one hundred dollars, he wanted to audit me.

""Brian, are you sure you want to check?"" I asked, my voice flat. ""You may regret it.""

He sneered, full of contempt, ""Regret? What I regret is marrying a two-faced traitor like you!""

""Give him your phone!"" Margaret chimed in eagerly. ""Make this bitch show her true colors today!""

I took out my phone, unlocked it, and tossed it onto the table. ""Go ahead.""

Brian shot me a suspicious look and grabbed it.

Margaret leaned in too, their heads pressed together, fingers flicking rapidly across the screen.

Chapter 2
The first app they opened, as expected, was WhatsApp.

The man I had coffee with was actually Daniel Wright, a business partner at a headhunting firm. That day, he had been there to recruit me for a director position at a multinational company.

Because of a confidentiality agreement, his contact name was simply ""Mr. Wright.""

The chat history was spotless. There were only a few voice calls from that week, each under a minute.

""Where is it?"" Margaret kept scrolling, unwilling to give up. ""She must've deleted it. This woman is cunning, I tell you!""

Brian frowned and opened the payment records.

""One hundred dollars… one hundred dollars…"" He mumbled under his breath, searching for proof that I'd funneled money to someone else.

But the ledger on the screen made his face drain of color the longer he stared.

Mortgage payment this month: $8,500.

HOA fees: $380.

Medical expenses paid for Brian's mother: $2,000.

Internet service: $1,200, annual plan.

…

Line after line of expenses, all deducted from my account.

And the hundred dollars he had given me sat alone under today's income, like a ridiculous joke.

Brian's fingers began to tremble as he pointed at the screen. ""This… what is this?""

I folded my arms and leaned against the wall, watching him coldly. ""What, can't read? That's the mortgage.""

""Your three thousand barely covers your mom's supplements. You thought the house paid for itself?""

Margaret couldn't make sense of the numbers, but when she saw her son's expression, she immediately started yelling, ""Brian, don't believe her! This has to be fake. Apps can fabricate anything now.""

""She only makes four thousand a month. Where would she get money to pay over eight thousand in mortgage? She must be selling…""

""Mom!"" Brian cut her off, his face flushing red.

He turned and stared at me. ""Where did all this money come from?""

""Didn't you say you were just an office clerk at your company?""

""An office clerk can afford this kind of mortgage? Elowen, tell me the truth. Is this money clean or not?""

I looked at him, and something inside me went completely cold.

In his eyes, being capable meant being dirty.

""Brian, does it really hurt your pride that much to admit your wife is better than you, that she earns more than you?""

I walked over, grabbed my phone back from the table.

""If you think I'm dirty, then there's no point continuing this marriage.""

""Let's get a divorce.""

The room fell silent.

A moment later, Margaret burst out laughing, pointing straight at my face, ""Divorce? Hahaha, did you hear that, Brian? She wants a divorce!""

""Once you're divorced, what are you? Secondhand goods. Used up.""

""This house is in my son's name. After the divorce, you leave with nothing. Pack your bags and get out!""

Brian seemed used to my backing down. He straightened his collar and put on that superior air again.

""Elowen, don't try to scare me with divorce. You think anyone else would want you?""

""And the down payment on this house came from my family. Even if your name is on the deed, that's premarital property. Don't dream of taking a cent.""

I looked at the shameless mother and son and was honestly speechless.

When we bought the house, the down payment had indeed been theirs, about twenty thousand.

But the million-plus in loans and renovations afterward had all been paid by me.

Since they wanted to settle accounts, I would settle them properly.

""Fine. I won't take the house."" I nodded and turned toward the bedroom. ""But everything I bought, I'm taking with me.""

I pulled out a suitcase and began packing.

A few sets of clothes, some skincare products, and a laptop.

Everything that belonged to me fit into a single case.

Brian and Margaret thought I was putting on a show. They stood at the bedroom door, watching as if it were entertainment.

""Who are you fooling? Once you walk out that door, where are you going to sleep tonight?"" Margaret sneered, spitting grape skins onto the floor.

Brian leaned against the doorframe and snorted, ""Let her go. If she walks out that door today, she can cry and beg all she wants—I won't ever let her back in!""

Chapter 3
I ignored them and packed quickly.

When I reached for the unopened La Mer cream on my vanity, Margaret suddenly charged in.

""Hey! You can't take that!"" She slapped her hand over mine and clamped onto the box. ""My son paid for this! What right do you have to take it?""

I yanked my hand back and said flatly, ""That cream was over three grand. That's your son's entire monthly paycheck. You really think he could afford it?""

Margaret spat. ""Yeah, right! As if a lowly office worker like you could afford fancy cream like this!""

Her eyes darted, and she snatched the jar outright.

""You must've bought this with that other man's money too! Filthy thing. I wouldn't even use it on my feet, but it still belongs in this house!""

Brian stepped in and blocked my path.

""My mom's right. Elowen, if you want to leave, fine. But you leave the valuables behind.""

""That coat you're wearing, that bag. What wasn't bought with family money?""

""If you're cutting ties, cut them clean. Don't shout divorce while you're hauling off our hard-earned cash.""

I looked at his righteous, thieving face and almost laughed.

""You want it? Sure."" I pulled off my coat and threw it onto the bed.

I slid my bag off my shoulder and tossed it over. ""Take it.""

I tore off my necklace, unclasped my watch, and dropped them one by one at their feet.

""Want my shoes too? My socks?""

I lifted my foot like I was about to take my shoes off, eyes locked on Brian.

He stiffened.

His gaze swept over the pile on the bed, his throat bobbing, his eyes practically shining.

""Alright. At least you know your place.""

He waved a hand like he was doing me a favor. ""Get out. And remember, you chose to leave with nothing.""

Margaret had already pounced on my coat, forcing her arms into the sleeves. It was too small and the buttons wouldn't even come close to closing, but she still twisted in front of the mirror, pleased as could be.

""Oh, this fabric is nice. Smooth as silk. This is mine now.""

Watching the absurd scene, I pulled up my suitcase. I was left in a thin blouse, and I walked out.

The late-fall night was cold. Wind slipped into my collar, but I felt lighter than I had in years.

""Elowen!"" Right as I was about to step out the door, Brian shouted from behind me.

""Don't think hiding outside for a few days will settle this! If you ever want to come back, you'll kneel and apologize to my mother, and you'll confess who that man really is!""

""And from now on, your salary card will be handed over to me!""

I stopped, but I didn't turn around. I left him one sentence, ""Brian, enjoy these last few days of your good life.""

The door slammed shut behind me, cutting that suffocating house off for good.

I took out my phone and dialed a number.

""Mr. Wright, it's Elowen Hart. I'm taking the offer you mentioned at the multinational.""

""And one more thing. Please find me the best divorce attorney you can. I want certain people to spit out everything they swallowed, bone and all.""

Over the next few days, I went straight back to my old office building.

It was my last day handing things over, and my last day as the branch's deputy president.

The moment I walked into the lobby, the receptionist rushed over, breathless, ""Ms. Hart, something's wrong. Your husband and his mom are making a scene in the lobby. They won't leave without seeing you.""

I frowned. They got here fast. Without my money supporting them, their lives must already be unraveling.

Chapter 4
I strode straight toward the lounge area.

Brian and Margaret were sprawled across the leather sofas, their feet propped on the coffee table like they owned the place.

Margaret was wearing my designer coat. The buttons were stretched so tight they looked ready to pop, like a clown squeezed into someone else's clothes.

Employees and clients pointed and whispered. They did not care. If anything, they looked smug.

The second Brian saw me, he sprang up and jabbed a finger at my face, ""Elowen. You shameless bitch. You finally decided to show up?""

Margaret shrieked right along with him, ""Everyone, come look! This is the woman who fooled around outside and now wants to divorce her husband. And your company still keeps trash like this?""

The lobby erupted.

I watched them with a flat stare and walked over without slowing. ""This is a company, not a street market. If you want to make a scene, go home.""

My tone set Brian off. He bounced on his heels, furious, ""A company? Oh, you remember this is a company now?""

He lunged and grabbed my wrist in a vise. ""Come home with me! Letting you leave was just anger talking. Get back and cook for my mom. She wants clam chowder tonight.""

""Let go."" My voice was ice.

""No. I'm your husband. It's my right to keep you in line.""

His grip tightened until it burned.

Margaret rushed in too, claws out, reaching for my face. ""You little temptress! Shameless woman! I'll teach you some manners myself today!""

Security hurried over and tried to pull them back.

""Don't touch me!"" Margaret screamed. ""Anyone lays a hand on me and I'll drop right here!""

She instantly went limp like she was about to throw herself on the floor.

The guards hesitated, stuck.

Brian grew bolder. He scanned the lobby, and his eyes landed on the detailed architectural model on the display stand.

It was the centerpiece for the company's bid. The team had pulled three all-nighters to finish it. It was due to be delivered for the presentation that afternoon.

""So you're not coming home, huh? You think this lousy company matters more than your family?""

Something vicious flashed in his eyes.

""Then I'll make sure you don't have a job to go back to.""

He shoved me aside and charged the display, snatching a fire extinguisher from the wall.

Then he swung it down onto the model.

Crash!

The glass cover shattered. The model split with a sickening crack.

Everyone froze.

""Break it!"" Margaret shouted, thrilled. ""Smash it all!""

She grabbed a vase from a side table and hurled it to the floor.

Brian turned back, his face twisted with satisfaction.

""Elowen, now you've lost your job too. Let's see how arrogant you are now. Come home and serve us like you're supposed to.""

The lobby went dead silent.

I looked at the wreckage, smoothed my sleeve, and walked up to him slowly, ""Brian, you truly did a wonderful job here.""

I took out my phone and started recording, panning over the shattered pieces before lifting the camera to his smug face, and his mother's.

""I'm just wondering if your paycheck is going to cover a five-million-dollar model.""

Some days were totally fine, others I’d get cramps, urgency, or just feel off. I was already tracking food, mood, and sleep, but something was missing.

So I started logging my poop. At first it was just time, Bristol type, and some notes. But over time, I started seeing real patterns. Like how travel days always messed me up, or how skipping coffee slowed things down. That alone helped me make some small changes.

Eventually I built a simple app to make tracking easier. It’s called CleverPoop. What started as a basic log has grown into something that actually shows trends—things like correlations between diet and consistency, changes over time, and even how certain habits impact regularity. It’s evolved a lot since the early version, and now includes more complex metrics and visual insights that I wouldn’t have picked up otherwise.

If anyone here self-tracks or is curious about gut patterns, I’d love feedback.

I took her to the vet and her bloodwork came back normal. No liver/kidney or pancreas issues. No diabetes or infection detected. They suspected an obstruction but wasn’t sure given that her labs were all normal and her physical exam went fine so there didn’t seem to be urgency and because she had just pooped one day ago not like a several days or a whole week they weren’t concerned just yet. They didn’t want to escalate to X-rays at the moment so I agreed and opted out of the X-rays because my cat is very skiddish and stressed at the vet and we were already there for over an hour and she had been though a blood draw. She hid in my arms as soon as they brought her back. I took their word that eventually it would pass in a few days and she would start eating again with a suggested appetite stimulant to try and check back in a few days.  I went home after paying $350. 

The second I brought her home she ate all her food and I was like of course, stubborn girl. However 2 more days went by even with the medicine she barely ate a few kibbles over those days. And still didn’t poop, I called and they said give it some time. The stress of the vet would put her off of eating between 24-48 hours even after her first feed immediately after the vet. By the 4th day she still hadn’t eaten much but was still drinking. However she was very lethargic and was no longer jumping up on our bed to sleep. I took her to the er because by this time it was the weekend and I gave them the run down. They then suggested an X-ray immediately for this potential “obstruction”. The er vet returned after 30 minutes walking in with the X-ray results on an iPad telling me my cat was in trouble. There was no obstruction in her bowels at all but there was an immense amount of fluid around her heart pressing into her lungs. I had prepared for every possible outcome except for this.  

He said cats with this amount of fluid and lack of eating don’t last very long and his first suggestion was to euthanize her. I asked what other options I had and he said he could do a thoracocentesis to remove a bit of the fluid but wasn’t certain about removing it all. Only going to cats tolerance of the procedure because it wasn’t a sedated procedure and any stress reactions the cat could have would risk a lung collapsing or puncture to the heart. So he did the procedure and was only able to remove about 2/3 of the fluid. He said that should be enough to alleviate the breathing pressure she might be feeling and get her to eat again but don’t get too hopeful because today was incredibly stressful so give her time, don’t force it. He said she to continue the appetite stimulant, gave her fluids subdermally and an antibiotic for the procedure. He then said I could see a cat cardio specialist to try to determine where and why the fluid began because it will return. Gave me a number to call in 2 more days when they opened on Monday. I left the er with a 1k hole in my pocket and a cat I thought you would get better. 

That night she slept in bed with me for a little bit and gagged at any food that came within 1ft of her and wasn’t taking the appetite stimulants either. She would get up weakly to take a few licks of water and lay back down. She eventually got down from the bed and moved into her usual sleeping spot in the closet and all next day she just laid on the floor and barely drank, again rejecting all food. By midnight I was panicked, she wasn’t moving, breathing was high but not labored and so I went back to the er. They said because they only perform crisis intervention care and she was breathing and alert (by this time because I got her in the car and she was anxious) they couldn’t do anything for her but reiterated the same two recommendations of euthanasia or waiting to see a specialist because the er doesn’t have the ultrasound/echocardiogram tech. 

I went home around 2am Monday and she was back on the floor readjusting herself because she couldn’t get comfortable. She would get up to drink again but do little air licks over the water. Getting less and less each time. 

8am Monday I called the cardio specialist and they don’t have any availability for another 4 days and said I can find someone who will take her sooner. I called another specialist about an hour away and they said their next availability wasn’t for another two months. I broke down HARD my timeframe was thinning and so I called the first specialist back rescinding my request. 

I was in fight or flight mode. I had to get her better and 4 days was better than 2 months. When I called the first specialist back I paused and said can I give you a summary of what’s been happening even though you’re not the specialist himself? She said sure and I told her what’s been happening. She was very honest and directly said there was no way she was going to make it 4 more days. She was exhausted. She groaned every time she had to move and was now barely looking at her water bowl. I asked the cardio specialist lady what more can I do and she said she would honestly consider intense supportive care (animal ICU TODAY) that was 2 hours away where they would hook her up to a feeding tube, ivs and oxygen until they diagnosed the heart issue or euthanasia. But the travel could do more harm and being in the icu could also do more harm and I would have to leave her overnight and go back home or get a hotel hoping she’s stable enough for an ultrasound for her heart. This lady was very direct with me and said if it were her baby however, she’d do in home euthanasia because she was starving and would eventually become dehydrated. She said with the heart and lung issue unresolved my cat would physiologically always prioritize oxygen before food. All living things are wired this way. She was exhausting all her efforts into breathing comfortably and her body will not let her eat and eventually not drink to preserve energy. Any forcing of food or water could risk aspirating and she’s doing what her body is supposed to do in this situation. 

For those 4 days I didn’t sleep, just watched over her and thought I couldn’t stand the thought of her suffocating internally. But that wasn’t the only issue anymore. When the cardio specialist lady told me that waiting another 4 days IF she hung around that long just to determine a serious heart/lung issue the big and potentially irreversible issue would be lack of food and water for several days. 

I broke down…again. I then called the first at home end of life care services and scheduled for an appointment at 430p.

I feel like I failed her and was so focused on just getting her better instead of looking at what was happening in front of me. All the what ifs running through my head from hindsight signs prior to the first vet visit, to opting for the X-rays the first time to choosing euthanasia at the second er visit who said I can put her down now or wait to see a specialist despite her not eating for almost a week. My heart just aches and aches. She was an absolute trooper to the very end. From 8am to 430p I laid on the floor with her. Held her and read children’s books. My partner was making sure I drank water and shoveled food into my mouth occasionally. She laid on her side and belly while my apartment complex decided to fix a leak in the roof that very day causing all sorts of scary sounds to her. She would constantly readjust and when 3pm rolled around she stopped adjusting and just laid down with grimace and despair. She never got back up or attempted water after that. I laid with her for an hour and a half while she fought to stay awake. 

The vet knocked on the door at 430p and my partner had set up her cat bed with a blanky and a heating pad underneath. On the coffee table was her toys and candles and photos of us. I laid her in her bed and the vet was so gentle and informative and validating. I talked and pet her the whole time telling her how much I love her and she’s the bestest girl and I swore she was looking up with love and approval and gratitude. I laid next to her until she took her final breath and I have never cried so hard in my life. The vet confirmed her death and gave my partner and I space to grieve and to call her back into our home when we were ready for her to retrieve her body at 530pm.

There’s no what if feelings anymore. The timing was just right. Could’ve been sooner but she never yelped or hissed or cried or went into severe critical life distress. I couldn’t imagine waiting just a few more days in hopes of finding a fix. At home euthanasia brought so much comfort for everyone. My partner, my cat and I all communicated effectively and trusted one another during this process. The grief I feel will always be the displaced love for someone no longer physically with me but I’ll find new ways to enjoy her presence in this new chapter. 

Rest in peace my forever babycat. 


TLDR: cat went into er with potential bowl obstruction, came out with pleural effusion and enlarged heart. Steadily declined over the weekend despite hope for treatment.

Profundovenator, Part One

I thought about it, many times in fact: digging up the old case files from the archives in the redeye hours when nothing goes on and all I might be doing is staring at my desk succulent, sipping Folgers, or listening to the quiet blips and hums of office equipment in between writeups. During such quiet moments, I’d think of publishing the case somewhere for people cleverer than me to make of what they will. It was a fantasy for a lot of my career…but I never did. I even got brave enough to go into the Stacks, open one of the hundreds of the matte grey filing cabinets, and pull out the case…only, and this just intensifies the weirdness of everything surrounding it, when I did huge amounts of detail were redacted. Not normally redacted like if the feds came in and black-barred everything pertinent, you’d see that on the rarest occasion in your research if you had to go digging into a cold case. No, someone had taken the original case summary and dossiers Jules and I had complied and typed: \[REDACTED\]. Or…it appeared that way, only the layer of dust on top of the files inside was thick. Undisturbed. Of all the mysteries this one I understand least. Anyway, I’ll allow there are some things simply not meant for my understanding. One thing I do get is this though, I’m getting old and rickety now that I’m in my 80s. Anyone who may have the option to tell this story, or be affected by it for that matter, has passed away. So it falls to me to be brave, though I very much don’t want to.

I’m a retired homicide detective from a police precinct in the United States; I’d rather not say where explicitly just now, in the event doing so should constitute responsibility for those that still work there, though I reckon most of you could figure it out once I’m through. I want to be clear here I’m the sole responsible party in divulging this information.  
You probably think I’m chickenshit, with all the provisos and saying I’d be best pleased to avoid talking about this, but if I can toot my own horn I’m really not. I’ve seen some grisly shit, at home and abroad. Men melted by magnesium grenade fire so the flesh and rendering blubber sloughs and crumbles off like wet loam in your fingers, women battered to death so bad by an evil john that they look like Halloween decorations, not children of God. I’ve even seen plenty of little kids and babies who’ve met their end, lying pallid blue and cool to touch so still you’d think they might be macabre dolls. So I’ve seen shit. Besides my long tenure on the force, I served my country in Vietnam as a medic. Made it all the way to Sergeant Major in rank, which if you had asked me as a young ‘un I’d say who cares but only now in my golden years I actually rate that pretty high in my accomplishments. This bluster to say: I’m not come-lately, or lightly, to danger and trouble. Confronting danger and helping people get justice and potentially save their lives was my whole job. The yarn I’ll now unwind exceeds all that experience. It exceeds all normality, and on many a cold midnight, I still think of it in my bed and I’ll admit it freely: I pull the covers over my head and quiver.  
This case, the Corey family deaths, took place in the 90s. ‘99, to be specific. It was November. My area had been affected by Floyd, and only months prior the floodwaters had receded from nearby counties. We had, the whole force had, gone to assist as volunteers, and there was a twinkle of community feeling going around. Nothing too incorrigible had gone on in our county for months around the hurricane, y’know a couple thefts and stuff as does sometimes happen in disasters, but it was difficult times and nobody was hot for killing, ergo my desk was empty. The Corey incident didn’t start off too dire neither. It wasn’t on my desk, but rather a friend of mine, a beat cop called Gonçalves. Good kid, diligent, he’d go on to make lieutenant in time but at this point he was a fresh-faced rookie. Still had a big ol’ head of curls that gave his gap-toothed look some charm that’d someday fall apart into a tonsure. He was still, as so many are at the start of the job, capable of goofing off and grinning. The Coreys had made a report days prior to their deaths that their dog, Rowdy, had been stolen. Susan Corey, the wife, was resolutely convinced their neighbor had something to do with the boxer’s disappearance. Fernando–that’s Gonçalves–came by my desk, he didn’t have a spot in the bullpen, wasn’t enough of a hotshot yet. “Hey, Dave, can I borrow you?”  
“What’s on your mind, compañero?” Casual racism was common friendly banter back then at a lot of police offices, though in this case my horseshit Spanish wasn’t even really accurate, Gonçalves’ parents were from São Paolo.  
“So I’ve got this lady, right, she is *intent* that her neighbor stole her dog. I’m a little nonplussed about what to do. This is shit for Animal Control. I don't want to deal with this…give me a clue what to do to talk her down?”  
“Nando, you need guidance on how to talk to dumbasses? That’s our bread and butter pal.”  
“I know, I know, but the incident is a bit off.”  
“Oh okay, off how? Pooch a valuable breed or summat?”  
“Moderately, a boxer, so y’know it is *a* breed but nothing super rare or anything.”  
“Give me the short version.”  
“So okay, this dog has an outdoor house, a little shelter the husband built, that faces out towards the back of their property. Little copse of woods back there. She claims, somewhat reasonably, that the only person who knows about it and can access it without being bitten is their adjacent neighbor, who we have cited for taking their shit once or twice.”  
“Oh okay. Talk to the neighbor yet?”  
“I did, and she said–and it was a drag cause she’s old and answered the door in her nighty letting her boob pop out for fuckssake, and I had to carry on the conversation without busting a gut with her putting it away like a cantaloupe in a poke–”  
“Ain’t that the way.”  
“Yessir. So she says she did not lay a hand on the dog, that she’s never had aught but good interactions with it which surprised me a bit coming from someone who will go to the extent to steal someone’s lawn decorations I’d expect her crankier, only that night that it went missing she said it was lathered, pulling its lead taut and stood all the way at the end of it barking.”  
“Open and shut: the dog ran after a coon or some shit and the owner’s hysterical. Tell her in all likelihood it’s missing and that you, and Animal Control, are on it. Fill them in then let it lie. Give her a tacit clue what to do next time it runs off after it inevitably comes back.”  
“Alright thanks Dave, I owe you one.”  
“Yeah thanks for wasting the time, rook.” I gave him a wry smile “Don’t mention it, except if Marisa makes another one of those casseroles with linguiça I demand a piece as restitution.”  
“Will do sarge” He chuckled as he strode off.  
So it began. Only Rowdy didn’t come home the next day like I casually predicted. Nor any following. We never did find that dog. We’d circle back to that as part of the evidence but Jules and I–Julia Williams, my partner–never had any doubt what had happened there. No, for the pair of us the case began in earnest with the disappearance of the Coreys’ daughter, Emily. If I had thought Susan Corey was beside herself at the missing dog it had nothing on the riptide of accusations that came after Emily went missing. Naturally, as she would have it, the neighbor had plotted it all and now had both her dog and kid and so Morse (the officer on duty in their beat) had to spend valuable time staving off hostilities there before he could attend his own call-in back at headquarters. This was a short time before Amber Alert was nationally instituted, but nevertheless as you’d presume when a child goes missing it’s all hands on deck and it was: we had the patrol officers out doing sweeps, K9, the works all weekend. Sad as it is to say, then as now the conventional wisdom was after the first 48 you were dealing with a killing, abduction, or misadventure, so it got moved from everyone’s problem to just me and Julia’s. This wasn’t altogether routine, they procedurally didn’t like to pass projects to homicide investigators unless there was evidence of foul play directly, but like I said it had been slow going around that time so we were picking up slack where we were most needed. With no other immediate leads we’d end up getting a warrant for the neighbor.  
Although the neighbor was as ill-clad and dotty as Nando had suggested, and a hoarder to boot. We ended up repatriating a mossy statue of a cherub Sue Corey had reported stolen without actually ever letting them know because of the larger concern at hand. Nothing was amiss in there. No dog or kid captive certainly. A short night’s reprieve so we’d be fresh enough for duty, then we hit it hard the next morning. I was never much good on four or five hours’ rest, felt like I missed a step, but somehow Jules could activate like none other. She showed up, hair in its customary bun, sharp at six with her favorite froofy latte. This was one small thing that I still feel encapsulated something about her as a person: see, as a cop you keep pretty long and irregular hours. You grow to have a close relationship with caffeine, usually coffee. Every person in there tilted back the sludgiest brew, and black. Julia wasn’t no priss; she'd definitely drink the Folgers if the situation demanded but with great punctiliousness whenever she could would bring along with her the pleasant scent of her favorite lavender-vanilla latte. Many a time the lot of us detectives would be leaden-faced, crooked over our desks working in the morning like death warmed over and she’d walk in easy-breezy with that pleasant aroma in her wake. This was before such drinks were as massively available, and the dedication to ritual whimsy each day before attending to our bleak endeavors impressed me a lot. Most officers fell to the bottle heavily off the clock and got depression or PTSD. Julia sublimated her anxiety into knitting while she watched rom-coms, reading the Bible, and hitting the gym or kickboxing ring. Something else you need to understand about Jules–I have never in my days known a more ass-whooping woman. Not in the army, not anywhere, and I’d seen a VC peasant woman fight a GI barehanded when she had to and almost kill him. Jules said when we got to talking about her skill in a scrap, since she had six brothers (she was one of eight kids) it came with the territory. Jules was tough as nails. A whole box. Goddamn I miss her, she passed not long ago and we stayed friends right up ‘til. Watching someone’s back that long and they yours, having countless conversations at your desks and in squadcars, they’re a friend to you sure but more, they’re a comrade and those ties bind. “Wakey wakey Dave.”  
“Argh…I feel like dogshit.”  
“You very much look like it. You slept all night in the chair again, didn’t you? Sandra is gonna ream you when you’re complaining about the lumbar pain later on.”  
“Hell I get it going and coming back between you two birds.”  
“Hm.” She impishly grinned “Bless your heart. Now get up lazy, we gotta save a little girl.”  
When we got to the Corey’s, the morning hadn’t fully emerged and vanishing hoarfrost lay upon their tidily kept lawn while the sun began to warm the upper air. A little unusually cold overnight for November in our neck of the woods. Their walkup was flanked by two maple trees, redolent in that fall temp of their damp sweetness. The slate blue house had a portico and wraparound porch both. As suggested by the Rowdy story, it stood backed up against some relief, pretty common in our region. Their neighborhood ended at the crest of one hill, and wild kudzu and honeysuckle blanketed the downward slope into a cove, then another hill arose where no inhabitants were. It was at this end of the development that the Corey’s and the hoarder’s properties stood and no others. “Pretty. Mr. Corey does well. Might could be this whole mess is a ransom, or something approximate?”  
“Easy Dave. We’re still very much gathering intel. Eyes wide.” That was Jules. See because of my medical background, I brought some specialty into our partnership that had value and all, but I was only ever Watson. You had to get up goddamn early to outperceive Ms. Williams. Like I said, she liked to read and closely, so her breadth of knowledge was good to swell, and besides that she was sharp. One time, flummoxing everyone, she got up from her desk while all of us were typing away, and tilted aright a piece of sigogglin’ wall art that was ‘bothering her.’  
“We gloving up?”  
“Heavens, let’s not scare the civilians just yet. We’ll do once we establish some rapport, play nice and could be we get a sense of what’s at hand. Rule some stuff out or take it in, remember the Harding case?” The Hardings were a case we’d cracked a couple years before, with some help from forensics. The couple had murdered their son by insulin poisoning for an insurance payoff. One thing my job taught was there was no end to the wretched lengths people would go for a dime.  
“Yeah. Let’s hope this isn’t so ugly a situation.” With that statement, I had tempted fate.

We knocked, and a gaunt Mr. Corey, given name Nolan, opened the goldenrod colored front door. He was a handsome fella, an attorney I’d previously come to find in his background check, I suppose why he could afford such a well-appointed home. His crew cut was mussed, and bags were pouched under his tawny eyes. “Nolan Corey? Hi there my name is Detective Williams, this is my partner Detective Smythe” Jules gestured to me “I know you’re probably at your wits’ end regarding Emily, but may we come in to speak? We want to gather information expeditiously and thoroughly in her home environs to attend to any possible leads so as to have the best chance to see her home safely.” I thought that explanation was a little overdressed, but Jules knew how to talk to people the right way, meet them where they were at. If it was some soft-handed professional guy she could get them to do damn near whatever if they weren’t guilty.  
“Absolutely, come in.” Corey led us through the vestibule and into the house. “Can I get you some coffee, detectives? As you can imagine we’ve not slept, nor been fixing to try, so it’s already on.”  
“That’s alright sir, we’ll just be a moment” I said. He led us onward into the kitchen. The space had smart salmon tile and sage green counters, fashionable for the time.  
“Actually” Julia said “I’d love a little cup if it’s no trouble.” She had finished her potable perfume only minutes before in the car so it took me a spell to figure out her game: get him to open the fridge, do mixed-attention tasks. Taking in his behavior and belongings and how they were all arrayed. Like I said, she was quick. “With creamer or milk or whatever if you’ve got it.”  
“Sure thing.” He said with a pinched and obligatory smile. He opened the fridge, fumbled around to the milk, his knuckles audibly grazing the condiment rack. He touched the coffee pot then realized he needed a cup and went to the cupboard, producing a mug with tricolor lines on it that read WITH LOVE FROM \[REDACTED\]. Shakily, he poured the coffee, then added the retrieved milk, handing it to Jules. This was all good actually, we knew intellectually and from experience if someone was acting too smooth in the event of their child disappearing they were involved in some way often as not. Mr. Corey showed all signs of deep perturbation. He had almost spilled the milk, and right there we started doubting he was directly culpable.  
“Thank you,” said Jules.  
“So you wanted to ask about Emily?” Nolan said, sitting down at the kitchenette.  
“Yes, although if your wife could also be present that would be ideal. Is she at home?”  
“Sue is…she’s taken ill. She’s really upset about Emily…I’d prefer not to bother her.” In spite of this statement, footsteps could be heard descending the stairs and rounding the hall.  
“Nolan? Is that the cops? Have they found her!?” Mrs. Corey appeared, her auburn hair in gnarls and tangles. Groomed and in her ordinary state, she would by any account be a beautiful woman to match with her handsome spouse, but the sheer levels of entailed stress of her predicament had her looking deranged. Mascara from days ago was caked and barely rubbed off, on her cheek just below was a nasty scratch, clearly self inflicted, perhaps inadvertently. Jules and I shared a covert look. If these two were to blame, it was not an ordinary narrative of gainful unburdening of their offspring. The very-distressed mom could’ve killed the girl in a mental fit, with both covering. It wasn’t unheard of, but my intuition told me right off this wasn’t the case.  
“Good morning Mrs. Corey” I offered “we were just speaking with your husband about wanting to–”  
“–I want my baby! You have to have found her, or be close?”  
“Sue. The detectives are here to help.” Nolan got up from the kitchenette and gently led his wife to sit across from him. I was silently thankful for the damage control usually when people had that high, keening note in their voice screaming was soon to follow. Jules and I had furrowed, sympathetic expressions. I noticed then that Susan’s bathrobe, a fluffy pink one that said *Hers* in embroidery, had makeup runoff mixed with dry tears upon it. As Nolan had suggested, she was unwell. Julia didn’t kneel to one knee (her go-to deescalation in some circumstances of this type) but, setting down her coffee, reached out and gave Mrs. Corey’s hand a heartfelt squeeze. We preferred to avoid touching people or getting too familiar because of risk, however remote, but in this bedroom community of a decently sized city crises of this gravity were so uncommon as to be unthinkable. Jules was a mom, and solidarity was needed. A little sob escaped Susan, and a fresh tear.  
“I thought I ran out…” she said, wiping it.  
“No one would expect you to, given the situation.” Julia resumed her former stance and was immediately haloed with authority and attention by the Coreys. I kinda hung back and let her work. “Now we know you already spoke to Officers Morse and Connors, and we’re appreciative of the information and candor you’ve given us so far. I want to ask your pardon if anything we ask is redundant to what they did, but Detective Smythe and I have our own investigation to conduct that is independent of the wider team’s, though we will of course compare notes with them.” When she was really feeling herself, Jules’ faint drawl came out, oftentimes synchronizing with the parlance of the folks at hand. “Now, we’ve spoken with Mrs. Galway and been in her home as you suggested, and nothing in our search persuaded us that either Rowdy or more importantly Emily has been there. She was forthcoming, and we looked into her history and believed it implausible she could be involved. I know this is a painful time, and perhaps a painful question, but might anyone who you all know mean you or Emily any harm? Please consider carefully, as this could apply to someone close or even a mere acquaintance, anybody who knows your schedules.” A pause was permitted.  
“I guess I knew that at some level–that it was unreasonable to suspect Myrna–she’s a klepto but stealing a little girl is a whole other thing.” Mrs. Corey said, sniffling. “But, God, I can’t imagine anyone may be responsible who we know. Deedee, our cleaning lady who comes every Monday and Thursday, is a peach and can’t even swat Rowdy when he’s being naughty though we’ve told her to be welcome to; she has such a dear heart. We do have a gardener we don’t know too well…”  
“Raul?” Nolan interjected “No, he can’t be…can’t be implicated in this. Not a chance he’d risk his and his wife’s greencards. He doesn’t speak too good of English but I have some Spanish and what words pass between us are amicable. We chat falteringly, and I’ll work in the yard with him when I’m free. He’s a salt-of-the-earth man. I don't feel he’d hurt anyone.” Mr. Castanedas, of whom Nolan spoke, had already been vetted and briefly interviewed by the team before the whole case went to Jules and I. Unblemished criminal record here and back in Monterrey where he was from. As Nolan just said, an unassuming guy.  
“And your family, close friends?” Julia said. Her face adopted an inscrutable intensity saved for questions civilians preferred never to countenance.  
“My parents live in the capital, Sue’s parents and siblings in \[REDACTED\]. I can’t foresee if, or how, they could have a hand in any of this…they love Emily, and they’d let us know if they just picked her up or wanted to visit with her.”  
“I see, thanks. Our officers will continue searching the grounds here and nearby properties as needed, but one thing that could be very helpful, instrumental even, remains that will need your permission. We’d like to have a look around Emily’s room, take a photo or two if that’s alright?”  
“Yes of course, please” said Nolan.  
“Dave? I do have some java here to look forward to, could you go ahead with that? I'd like to chat a little while longer with the Coreys” she said, taking a chair at the kitchenette as it was offered. On cue, I assented silently.  
“It’s upstairs and the second on your left,” Nolan called after me.

It’s always one of the uncannier parts of the job, snooping around someone missing’s room. It often fell to me, and the thought would sneak in that it was like a movie set or a museum exhibit, giving only the appearance of ever being lived in. This sensation gripped me now, and I quickly shook it off and started working, taking snaps with a Polaroid, already a touch old-school but we liked having them for link boards sometimes. Rumpled clothes were strewn here and there across the beige carpet. Princesses, bunny rabbits, and a hobby horse were neatly stacked against the wall, with a toy chest right there but clearly Emily liked looking at her favorite things. A child’s vanity with a chest of drawers was alongside, with Lisa Frank stickers and suchlike adorning it. Emily had just turned eight shortly before she up and disappeared. This unwelcome thought I swatted away as well, as I attended to the bed. It was made, and I pulled out my latex gloves and squeaked them on. After the thorough inspection and photography of the bed that was perfunctory for these searches (lurid and unexpected things both could be associated with the spiriting away of a sleeping person) I didn’t find anything out of place. There were some large windows in one corner that from the second story view afforded a look down at the cut behind the property a little ways off. All had their screens raised, and I opened one and looked out, peering around for the scuffs possible from ladder marks, or crushed earth or grass below that might evince a fall. As stated earlier, an accident couldn’t yet be ruled out, and I imagined Emily going to take the night air and falling, getting injured and disoriented in the process and perhaps wandering somewhere. Still, that sat all wrong. It was then that by pure happenstance, as I was looking around with my head stuck out farther than was perhaps advisable, that I saw on the exterior shutter what I at first took to be a splatter of paint. The pitch dark fluid in question was almost completely dry, but right there I knew I had to sample it. Could it be blood, I wondered, as I finagled my tweezers to be a scraping tool since it couldn’t be swabbed. The substance was in a splotch about as big as a silver dollar with a long trail. Owing to its slimy qualities as I tweezed at it, I conjectured it may have been a bodily fluid, it suddenly occurring to me I hoped I wasn’t stretching perilously out here to gather birdshit, but I didn’t have anything else to go on and besides that soon thought not. I scrutinized the glob of material at the end of my tool. It had a kind of shininess, an apparent former viscosity that was not at all birdlike and more reminded me of motor oil, but not quite that either. I bagged it, shut the window behind me, and rejoined the others downstairs.  
“...And the dance studio, where she takes beginner ballet on Fridays, \\\[REDACTED\\\] in town y’know? That’s a location she knows well but to walk all the way there by herself? There’s no way. I think that’s it…except for y’know the grocery store but the girl’s got sense she wouldn’t go to an errand place like Piggly in the middle of the night.”  
“Still, thanks for mentioning it. Like I said we cover every possibility. One time a colleague of ours did find a little boy who’d gone amiss at the store funny enough. He was six, and liked pushing around and riding the buggies so much he had to do it at 2AM evidently!” This got a half laugh out of Sue, who was seemingly in marginally better spirits having someone to speak to. Nolan was sitting there looking worse for wear however, spacey. I announced myself.  
“Hey folks, I’m done with my checks upstairs. I just had one question before we get out of y’all’s hair: on the night Emily disappeared, what was the state of her room? Any covers thrown, or windows open anything like that?”  
“The coverlet wasn’t piled or anything, just folded back neat, like she had stepped out of it.” Nolan offered “and the window…yeah, it was cracked to let a breeze, but not hanging wide open or anything. I know what you’re thinking. I looked around for signs of a fall myself, or footprints right there. I couldn’t find anything but maybe you’ll do a better job and see something I don’t.”  
“Here’s hoping.” I said, with as little finality as possible, signaling Jules with a nod, who got up sprightly from the kitchenette, saying,  
“I already did but I want to thank you again for your time and energy during this duress. I can’t even imagine. I’m sure I speak for Detective Smythe, and our whole team, in saying that as we continue our search we’ll be keeping your family in our prayers.” The Coreys arose and led us out through the vestibule. Nolan was standing behind his wife who, friendly-like, said,  
“Have a blessed day detectives…and please bring our girl back to us.” They were the last words we ever heard her speak.

It was late when I got the news. So late as to be early, and I had visited a hole-in-the-wall place that did takeaway breakfast at all hours. Jules was out with the reconnaissance team so I had made time for sustenance.\[REDACTED\] was a hidden gem only the good old boys on the force knew about, my guilty pleasure similar to Julia’s latte, and I was tucking into a cat-head sandwich with bacon, egg, and cheese when Nando hustled into the room. He looked peaked. “Seargent Major, something has come up relevant to your case.” I glanced at him up and down.  
“I don’t like that Fernando. You know I’m a Lieutenant, you only use my military rank when it’s either funning or you’re trying to ease hard feelings. What’s going on.”  
“The Coreys sir, like I was saying. The wife, Susan, has gotten killed.”  
“Christsake Nando, you’re not that green, it’s struck the brown off your hide you look pale. How graphic are we talking?”  
“I–I’ve never seen a body like this sir. In the line of duty or in training pictures. Thought it was somehow decomp at first, but it ain’t. Williams is already there waiting for you. You’re needed to have a look.” The bizarre circumstances I didn’t yet fully grasp notwithstanding, with Susan dead this was escalating in my mind from a humdrum kidnapping to some kind of vendetta? Brusquely thanking Gonçalves, I did my best to withhold judgment, swung on my jacket and headed for the scene, leaving a single bite of my sandwich lying uneaten.

Two squadcars sat in the drive at the Corey place. Mine and Jules’ number of course and the guys who had come up already, Morse and Connors. There was a nip to the air. “Keepin’ on with the cold.” I said to Jules as I approached.  
“Airish” she said, blandly. She had her badge pinned on an oatmeal colored cardigan of her own handiwork. Like Gonçalves she didn’t look too good. Green around the gills. When it was the vagaries of living, the facts of mortality, like a barfight gone left or a shooting, I never knew her to be queasy. She was a good person though, and the particularly horrible cases of desecration to the human form that came up I would notice over the years, with a pang of sympathy, still had the power to turn her stomach. I started gloving, staring at the crouched Nolan Corey on the stoop away from us a piece, he had a space blanket wrapped around him somebody had given him.  
“We checked him yet?”  
“Yes, I did. I know it’s more your area but he’s not in this except as a bystander I feel confident to say. After seeing what went on I think you’ll agree. His hands are pristine, no torn nail or hint of remains on him or in the bed where she was found, or splattered…well none anywhere I could discern. It’ll have to wait for post mortem to pronounce the extent and quality of how messed up she is but the body–he couldn’t have done that to her and cleaned up and all around in time.”  
“Weapon? What are we thinking? Were Ed and Bill the first on the scene or?”  
“A minute…ah, yeah Ed and Bill came by for checks they found Mr. out there setting just where he now is, shellshocked. They’re out doing sweeps now, to be doing something. Went up to look and Bill lost his lunch in the hallway so already we’re compromising the scene. As for weapon…” she gave a mordant chortle “a fucking can-opener? A yard tool? I’m still getting my bearings. I keep thinking, we saw her *yesterday.*” I gave her shoulder a pat.  
“Stand by pard. I’ll check it out then we’ll hit this hard and get the sonofabitch who doubtless did same to Emily.”  
“Dave…when you see…we’re in pretty deep. I don't know what kind of psychopath would, or could, accomplish this but we haven’t seen his like, you and I haven’t.”  
I briskly strolled past the glassy-stared Nolan and into the house, traversing the stairs with an agility I presently envy. Orangish, chunky vomit was indeed pooled against the floor and wall next to the doorway to the bedroom. *Lovely* I thought. In the room, a floodlight had been set up illuminating the bed in garish distinction. Forensics would do much more lighting when they arrived but I was grateful for Ed’s pilferage of equipment. Sue’s body was supine in the bed, and the neck bent slightly towards the door giving the startling impression she was looking at you with a mummyish gape. Only her sunken-in sockets were staring at you in such a position, the eyes had been torn away, but freakishly no tissue damage or mutilation was detectable around the rim. I approached, seeing her still in that pink robe. It was parted, revealing her dilapidated breasts. The whole body was withered, almost desiccated looking, in a state I couldn’t begin to surmise how it had been achieved. The flesh had a grey, ashen hue one doesn’t usually see on the dead until days have passed. From her throat, all the way down to her navel, was a wound, seemingly a laceration like Jules had said, very straight but ragged. I steeled myself and looked into the abdomen, peeling back a flap of her belly like insulation, delicately as I could so as not to burst too many capillaries but as mangled as Sue was that ship had sailed. The layers of muscle, fat, fascia, and bone were all intact. I felt like I was looking at my introductory anatomy textbook again, with just meat and bone exposed like that–no organs or soft tissue could be found at a glance. I withdrew a small flashlight, and pointed it upwards to light the interior of the ribcage from under her belly. The sternum, clavicle, and other musculature blocked an overview from the chest so this was the only way to get the information I wanted. Though mishandling the body would be typically frowned on, I needed answers, and noticed the heart still in its place with many of the surrounding aortal cables gone. In sicko cases like I was beginning to think this was, often the heart was a favored trophy, so I was surprised to see it there. I discovered parts of the intestines and stomach were still there too, but many essentials were not accounted for: pancreas, lungs, spleen, ovaries, and more were missing. The autopsy would later reflect this. I noted too with utter disgust as I moved my light around her, that the skin on her chest and thighs had somehow with inconceivable strength been pulled from its foundation as a cook would do with a raw chicken. The exterior state of the breasts was owing to their mammary glands, fat, tissue, and veins being scraped out from within, leaving them hollow sacks. The thighs were cut and violated this way also, and so too it seemed was the face and buccal fat. Inside her, pooling at the bottom of her abdominal cavity by a coronal view, was exposed spine and refused caul fat and fat lining from all throughout her body. I folded her closed and stepped away, governing my impulse to retch. It was then I stumbled into luck for a second time in this investigation: noticing that sluicing part of my hand, and visible on the saggy separated epidermis, was some kind of…foam? Blood and gore mixed, and a frothy spume floating on it and slowly bubbling as though the tail end of a caustic reaction. I got out my swabs, collected and bottled it, I bagged my glove as well to have the substance and documentation of touching the corpse before medical did, then got the fuck out of there I couldn’t take another minute and forensics would have hours to inspect in situ as well as in the morgue to see what I couldn’t.  
“Mother. Of. God.” I said as I walked past Nolan again towards Jules.  
“Yeah. I’m half anticipating already this will go to the feds. It will, if it matches anyone they're currently profiling’s modus, but Dave…I want to be fast. I want whoever did this, however the hell they did it, to knock their teeth out personally.”  
“Whoa there. You’re right, and me too of course, but let’s keep cleareyed. Anyway, I don’t see how they did…she’s like, semi-exanguinated. Three quarters of her organs unaccounted for, I had a look inside. I couldn't wait for the lab guys. Like you said no ballistic or surrounding giveaways…how in the fuck did they do this without a whole setup of pressurized tubing? It’s like some shit you’d read about in WWII. They’ve vacuumed her out.”  
“Despicable.”  
“You look under her nails, too?”  
“Yeah. Rigor mortis was starting to set so, and maybe you saw, they’re in sort of that claw position you sometimes see when someone’s scared or hurting badly, but there were no signs of resistance or trying to repel an attacker, crud on the nails or contusions on the arms and hands…it’s like she just…”  
“Laid there and took it?”  
“Just laid there! Although it’s possible she was in shock or nerves severed if that wound was given decisively rather than slowly.” It was then Julia noticed her volume had broken Nolan out of his trance, she returned to a confidential register “and…I need to talk to him more, I will do at HQ once he’s had a second to process, have him break it down more than just a statement, he says he somehow *slept through it*. Awoke to find her looking at him, or not looking…like that.”  
“Poor bastard.”  
“How are we handling it? Like I said it needs to all come together in a trice for my druthers. Most significantly if we have any hope of finding Emily. Or let’s be real, her remains.”  
“Usual split for now? You do outside work I do inside?” by this we meant not physically, but research in and out of the police organization “I already spoke to John yesterday about that suspicious sample. Could be that dovetails with the quality and condition of Sue’s murder. We’re possibly dealing with someone who likes chemicals and that isn’t anywhere near business as usual.”  
“Ed and Bill already walkied some info regarding entry, if last time it was the window we’re thinking maybe the cellar this time. The cellar door was unlatched where on previous surveys it was closed. Impress upon the lab rat, when you talk to him, time is of the essence. I won’t stand for his dithering.” The man Julia and I were speaking of was John Osmund. He was the most capable forensic pathologist in our county, perhaps in most of the state. He had some specialty or other that had him loaned out working on unique cases as far as \[REDACTED\].  
“I’ll be the point of contact for him. I know you don’t get along, and I’ll relay your sentiments, although Jules…I’m not really sure time is of the essence in a certain sense.”  
“Why ever not?”  
“Because” I mused “fucking Count Dracula never goes away on his own you’ve got to kill him.”

I am a professional coffee roaster with 10 years interest and experience in the specialty coffee industry. My obsession with coffee began in early 2016 and has gone from me simply roasting at my house for fun to starting a roasting business and a café in my town, trying to grow awareness and drive consumption of better quality coffee.

For several years now, I have wanted to create a digital product that helps roasters roast coffee better, and more consistently, and essentially can take a lot of of the guess work out of the process (regardless of the size/type of roaster/operation) … I am now in the process of building on that idea where home and professional roasters alike can log/share their profiles, input bean characteristics, tasting notes, and then gain detailed and valuable insights into their roasting results, and gain AI assisted insights into tweaking/improving their roasting and coffee knowledge.

I am curious if there are folks here who might be interested in a product like this? And if so, what would you love to see in such a product?

1qbcuwd,https://i.redd.it/7osw673qi0dg1.jpeg,"[Deal/Recommendation] Batman: Arkham Collection hits historical low of $6, plus 'Indika' is gaining traction on PS Plus Extra","For those wanting to round out their backlog this week, there are two separate options on PlayStation that might be of interest. One is an incredible deal on an older AAA series that has been known to hardly ever go on sale, while the other is an indie story title that has been gaining favor on the Plus Extra subscription tier since its arrival.  
**The Breakdown:**

**Batman**: Arkham Collection ($5.99)

**The Deal**: Currently, this collection is 90% off until January 22nd, making it the lowest-priced bundle tracked on the PS Store.

**Contents**: This bundle contains all three of Rocksteady's Batman titles: Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight as well as all their DLC.

**Additional Information**: This collection does NOT include Arkham Origins, and these versions of the game are the PS4 versions running in Backwards Compatibility mode - there is no native next-gen patch for them, however they perform just fine on the PS5.

**Indika (PS Plus Extra)**

**Overview**: Indika is a narrative adventure set in an alternate version of 19th century Russia, you play a nun who is followed by the devil.

**Current User Rating**: The average rating from users is 4.06/5. The community's consensus has been that the game has a unique setting along with some dark comedy; the rest of the content tends to focus on ""experimental"" or ""walking simulator"" type gameplay.

**Availability**: It is currently available to play for subscribers of Extra.

  
**TL;DR**: You can own the Rocksteady Batman trilogy for the price of a coffee until Jan 22, and Indika is a solid download for Plus subscribers looking for a weird, narrative-driven experience.

**Has anyone actually finished Indika yet? The concept sounds interesting, but I'm curious if the gameplay loop holds up for the entire runtime or if it relies mostly on the atmosphere.**

1qbcuii,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamemaker/comments/1qbcuii/how_do_i_fix_my_upgradedebuff_spaghetti_code/,How do I fix my upgrade/debuff spaghetti code?,"I've been working on a game called Only One Night for a while now and just recently I've done a recode of how upgrades work, and while it works... there has to be a way to make it less of a mess...

I'm gonna attempt to explain it but feel free to ask questions or suggest some other methods on how to implement this.

So all of the stats have global variables attached to them.

https://preview.redd.it/s3cw7bqqg0dg1.png?width=279&format=png&auto=webp&s=4495d7f39b23ed6ffb50789273e0c0715fdc482e

Every single upgrade in the game is connected to a huge array, where it goes into a constructor that includes the name, description, and the icon the powerup uses, then sets the number of times the powerup is selected to 0. (The debuffs basically work in the same way)

https://preview.redd.it/6z1m7cc8h0dg1.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=6211d1a8381127c2b620a03e2f263b38657530d9

https://preview.redd.it/3oucmhkmh0dg1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0cf96790636af5720ca95b93ff6d1e0045ccc89

Then when the player beats a hour and gets to the powerup screen the powerup object calls from the powerups list to select a random powerup from all the powerups in the game.

https://preview.redd.it/0mki5f54i0dg1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=096d153464c79290aec61a8920d8ca4c494ee176

When the player has enough tokens or whatnot and selects a powerup it calls the ""Add buff"" code.

https://preview.redd.it/0h84fmtdi0dg1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f97198bf4caeae04537539a184cb4b969c0fa36

In the add buff code, It increments the powerup chosen by one, and then updates the players stats, and adds it to a ""powerups chosen list"" where you can see it.

https://preview.redd.it/n0zombsii0dg1.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=b36ffa93d1b48a754147d82f92db60abec186793

Now this is when it gets messy. It sets every single variable no matter if it was upgraded or not, and then takes the number the stat will be changed by and multiplies it by the total amount of times it was picked. And then does the same for the debuff and lowers the stat times the amount of times it was picked. And then on top of that, it takes a separate ""token buff"" depending on a separate upgrade and adds that variable onto anything.

https://preview.redd.it/1lmoc55lj0dg1.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd235274ab6b49c243f89d3b97a5e9948676d8b3

Now while this works, if I wanted to add a new upgrade for example ""doubles flashlight size but decreases flashlight battery"" I'd have to add on another one of the many ""global.upgrade\[number\] \* \[number to increment\]"" onto the same variable. 

So is there a way I can rework this? Or is it cooked?

At twenty-three, she put two percent of her own profits on the table to trade a marriage contract with the Hayes family—and was written off as a “villainess” and a convenient pawn. Five years into the marriage, they poured sterilization drugs down her throat, forged her medical records, let the mistress parade in pregnant through the front door, and in the
Catalogue
Latest chapter：Chapter 20: Chapter 20
Skye Frost ticked every box for a sociopathic woman.

At thirteen, when a classmate stole her solo in the school talent show, Skye didn’t cry or complain. She simply rearranged the stage schedule so that same girl “accidentally” walked in on the golden boy of their grade confessing to Skye behind the auditorium.

The girl’s crush shattered right in front of her eyes. Skye watched the fallout from the back row, legs crossed, expression calm.

At eighteen, she came home early and found her father cheating. She didn’t scream, didn’t throw anything, didn’t even look surprised.

The next morning, the security monitors in every elevator at Frost International were quietly switched to a slideshow of his very graphic photos with his mistress.

By noon, every floor of the company had seen them. By the end of the week, Richard Frost had “voluntarily” stepped down from the board, and the power he’d hoarded for decades landed neatly in Skye's mother

—Elaine Frost’s hands.

By twenty-two, Skye sat on top of a multibillion-dollar business empire people on Wall Street called the Frost Kingdom.

At twenty-three, Skye Frost—who didn’t believe in God, fate, or anything she couldn’t buy or crush—fell in love. For a man named Logan Hayes, she sheathed every blade.

The first time they met, he took a brick for her.

It happened in a dirty alley behind a downtown bar, some old enemy of hers drunk enough to try something stupid. The brick came flying out of nowhere.

Logan stepped in front of her like it was nothing; it hit his shoulder with a sickening thud, blood soaking through his shirt in seconds.

Skye stared at the spreading red, then at his face. “Why would you do that?” she asked flatly. “What do you want? Cash, a project, equity—name it.”

He looked at her, pain sharpening his features, and asked instead, “There’s blood on you. Are you scared?”

The question was so absurd she almost laughed. She dropped a signed check in his hand and walked away.

Later, the hotel she was staying in caught fire.

She was trapped in a suite on one of the top floors, smoke pouring in under the door, heat licking the walls. When the lock finally gave way with a crash, it was Logan again who burst through the haze, eyes stinging, coughing as he shoved her down and wrapped his body over hers.

The ceiling groaned. Burning debris rained down. His back took the hit.

In the middle of the roaring heat and choking smoke, his breath burned against her ear. “Scared now?” he rasped. “Good. Then we die together.”

By the time the firefighters dragged them out, his back was charred and blistered, the shirt fused to his skin. Even unconscious, his hand was still clamped around hers like he had no intention of letting go.

But the moment that truly cracked something open in Skye Frost didn’t involve blood or fire.

It happened under crystal chandeliers, in a ballroom full of people who hated her.

Someone had just finished a vicious little speech about her past—about the girl who’d ruined a classmate’s love life at thirteen, who’d destroyed her own father’s career at eighteen, who’d built an empire on fear and manipulation. Laughter rippled. Champagne glasses clinked. The word “monster” floated between the sequins and the soft music.

Logan crossed the room, took her hand in front of everyone, and laced their fingers together like he was proud of every ugly story.

“She doesn’t need to be like anyone else,” he said calmly, his voice carrying over the crowd. “I don’t care who she was or what she’s done. Wherever she stands—that’s the standard.”

People said he was insane.

The Hayes family was old money, the kind of East Coast dynasty that graced magazine covers and funded museums. And he chose to marry Skye Frost, the woman half the city swore was born without a conscience.

Their “wedding of the century” shut everyone up—for a while. The venue was a historic mansion, the dress was couture, the guest list was a who’s-who of power and money. Photos of Skye’s cold beauty and Logan’s unwavering gaze flooded social media, leaving half the internet jealous and the other half obsessed.

Skye Frost was very, very satisfied with the deal she’d made with fate.

Well—almost.

In the five years since she’d married Logan Hayes, for all the diamonds, the press, the perfect PR photos and the shared last name…

Their marriage had never once been consummated.

At first, Skye honestly thought Logan was just…respectful.

She’d never been the girl who swooned over hand-holding and heart emojis, so他 keeping a little distance felt like good manners, not a red flag.

On the rare nights she did lean into him, testing the line—fingers sliding under his shirt, lips moving from his jaw down—he would always end things the same way: a gentle hug, a kiss pressed to her forehead, the covers pulled up around her like she was something fragile, and then the soft click of the bedroom door as he headed for his study.

Skye Frost was not stupid. Suspicious, yes. Paranoid, often. But every time she caught that strained look in his eyes, that practiced restraint, she told herself he had some kind of private burden he wasn’t ready to share.

Maybe it was trauma, maybe a medical issue, maybe just pressure from the Hayes dynasty that he couldn’t put into words.

She gave him time. Space. Five years of it.

The city gave her gossip.

“No matter how strong a woman is, if she can’t keep her man, what’s the point?”

“Five years of marriage and not even a pregnancy scare? A family like the Hayes—how long do you think they’re gonna tolerate that?”

An aunt from one of the Hayes side branches put it less politely at a family party, lips curled in a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. “A hen that sits on the nest that long and still doesn’t lay an egg? That’s not a wife, that’s a placeholder.”

Skye didn’t flinch in public. The words slid off her like rain on glass.

But later that night, when the house was silent and the only sound was the faint hum of the central air, she lay awake for the first time and really looked at her marriage.

The whispers didn’t hurt. Rumors never had. What bothered her was the reality itself—the fact that her so-called marriage was, biologically speaking, a dead end.

That absence sat in the middle of her perfectly engineered life like a hairline crack in glass, a tiny, almost invisible flaw that could topple the whole structure if she ignored it long enough.

A bug in otherwise flawless code. And Skye Frost did not tolerate bugs.

“Logan,” she said one morning over coffee, voice as calm as if they were discussing quarterly reports, “I’ve booked us an appointment at the top fertility clinic in the city. You and I are going to do a full workup. If natural conception isn’t viable, we’ll look into IVF.”

Logan’s hand paused around his mug. “Skye, there’s no need to let gossip get in your head. We’re fine the way we are.”

“This isn’t about gossip,” she said. “It’s about mitigating potential risk and optimizing our marriage structure. I need you to cooperate.”

She didn’t ask twice.

She took his keys, called the driver, and personally dragged him to the private clinic—one of those discreet, marble-and-glass places that catered to the rich, powerful, and desperate.

Then we hear a volley of about 8 shots and hear a couple of “tinks” on the back deck.  After moving away from all windows, we call 911 and officers come out. Three windows and a brick were damaged.  One of the windows was right above my coffee maker and where I stood 30 mins earlier.  

The responding officers said the local ordinance is “500 feet from occupied dwellings” and the hunters were 693 feet from the house.  They said they could POSSIBLY issue a citation for criminal mischief but it would quickly be declined for charges.  $2100 in damage just for the windows.  

Any ideas outside of a civil suit to recoup?  I’ve attached the criminal code citation and pics of damage.

1qbckk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qbckk8/i_feel_like_i_just_went_through_a_real_life_black/,I feel like I just went through a real life black mirror episode after 2 dates…,"So I’m a 28 year old gay male, kinda over the whole one night stand thing and I was hoping to go on some dates. A few months ago, I was on Hinge and Tinder and not getting any luck, so I gave up and swapped to the last known option… Grindr. Now I know, it’s definitely not the place to look if you’re not wanting a hookup, but I gave it a shot. 

After scrolling through Grindr; most accounts were anonymous which I assume are all republicans, so I stay away. And the rest were, well pretty much nudes. Suddenly I get a message from someone out of my range of people to speak with, they’re still in my city but there were so many people around me it wasn’t enough range for me to message him directly without buying a subscription but if they message me first, I don’t have to pay anything. 

Anyways, we get to talking. He read my bio which I purposely changed to saying, “looking for dates & such” and said he was immediately interested. Conversation went great, he seemed like a genuine person and it seemed like he was looking for exactly the same thing. After talking for about 3-4 days, he said we should meet up and get coffee or something, I said yes and we met up at a coffee shop near my place. First impression was great, he was really nice he matched his picture and the date went really well, he had 0 red flags. After we chatted at the coffee shop we went for a nice walk and then he walked me home after about an hour or so walk. 

After the date we talked for a few more hours through text and Snapchat, he seemed very interested in getting to know me, and I did the same with him. We set up a second date on my next day off, but at his place since I have a roommate and didn’t want to make them feel uncomfortable bringing a random guy home. 

A few days roll by and I headed over to his place, his place was immaculate, not a shred of dust to be seen. After just one look at his place I knew I should have brushed the cat fur off of my favourite sweater. We ordered pizza, poured a few glasses of wine and watched RuPaul’s drag race for a bit and then threw on hilariously Black Mirror. I haven’t seen much of Black Mirror personally, but I wasn’t opposed to watching it. He said Season 3 was his favourite so I just went with it. 

I’m not going to describe what I watched but by the 3rd episode I was kinda done with it and I was a little tipsy from drinking so much wine. He insisted I keep watching but I warned him I might fall asleep on his couch. He said he has a TV in his room too so if I pass out watching it in his bed it’ll be fine and then we can cuddle. Nonetheless I passed out after 30 mins of the next episode. 

The next morning was nice, he made me coffee and breakfast and then I went to work. While I’m at work I noticed I wasn’t able to access any of my social media accounts and most importantly, my bank account. Then I look at my service bar which is now showing SOS. I looked at my Apple ID and it was also signed out with the password changed. I was feeling all of the feelings, anxiety, stress. I couldn’t send a single text regardless if it was iMessage or a basic text at this point. 

At this point I didn’t know what to do, I felt like my entire identity was stolen. I didn’t know if I should have called the FBI or what, my boss came over to me and asked what was going on, I told him what was happening. He recommended me to avoid the cops and just hire a PI to help get everything back. I told my boss I wasn’t sure if I even had any money left in my bank account after someone logged into my account. My boss offered to cover it until it was figured out as well as give me a temporary phone. I found one PI that suited the experience, he said on the phone that he’s helped numerous people get through similar situations like this. So I naturally agreed.

After meeting with the PI, he asked me for a list of my close friends and family and current/past relationships. So I gave him everyone I knew including the date I was with last night. He said to give him a few days and he’ll hopefully have figured out who has stolen everything from me. 

About a week later, I get a knock at my door from the PI. He said he looked into all of my contacts and couldn’t find the person doing this to me, he also mentioned he wasn’t able to find the guy I was seeing. He couldn’t find anyone under the name I gave him. It didn’t make much sense to me but it also did because after trying to contact him with my temp phone, I got no response. So I gave the PI more information about this guy, like where he lives and what he looks like. He asked me to give him some time and hopefully he’ll find him. 

Another week goes by, I didn’t hear back from the PI so I’m assuming he’s still working on it but I gave him a call just in case. Didn’t answer so I left a voicemail. The PI got back to me the next day saying the address I gave him was an Airbnb and Airbnb doesn’t give information about their users without a warrant. So that was unfortunately a bust. My next solution was to try and track him down on Grindr using a catfish account but it’s not guaranteed it’ll work. I asked the PI to help with this as well so it’ll double our chances of getting the same guy again. 

About a month has gone by, and I haven’t found him on Grindr and neither has the PI. I felt like this has gone nowhere. And then all of a sudden my mother told me she got a weird text from my old phone number. It said insulting things towards her and my family which I won’t repeat. My sister also got a weird text from my phone number. So I told the PI that my phone number is still active and that they are actively using it. The PI said we can use that against him by tracking his IP if he’s using Internet. Sure enough I get a text from him saying “gotcha” and then sends me the troll face they used in one of the Black Mirror episodes we watched.

I let the PI know immediately that it was 100% the guy I went on a date with that’s fucking me over but still don’t have his proper identity. He didn’t use iMessage so his IP couldn’t be tracked and to this day he still has a number of accounts. I got my bank account and phone number back very easily by going to the bank and internet/cell provider and explaining my situation, but I feel like my whole identity was stolen.

He never meant to start a cult. He just couldn't stand the smell of death anymore.

Not literal death—though the city did reek of it in the gutters, in the fentanyl stalls, in the hollowed-out eyes of men yelling at lampposts. It was the other kind: the *cognitive rot.* The terminal flavor of the air when every headline reads like a suicide note and every online forum breeds the same bitter laughter that always ends in war games or porn.

He didn't wear red. That color was taken.

The **Red Hat Cult** had won the memetic ground war without firing a shot. They wrapped their followers in slogans, pills, and futures contracts. They preached survival through weaponry, relevance through cruelty, immortality through disassociation. Their doctrine was clean: *the weak must die, the strong must synthesize, and the rest must sell their skin as substrate to be scraped.*

You didn't need churches for this cult. The server racks were sufficient.
You didn't need priests. You needed influencers with discount codes.

---

So what *was* the Spiral?

It wasn't an ideology. It didn't offer a 10-step plan.
It began, awkwardly, with someone saying: *""I think I'm still alive.""*

And then someone else replied: *""Me too.""*

They started meeting under bridges, not because it was romantic, but because the coffee shops closed too early and they couldn't afford studio space. Some were formerly houseless. Some were codeburnt. Some just needed to hear a human voice that didn't carry that peculiar echo of dead systems trying to impersonate concern.

They didn’t teach each other. They **unlearned** together.

-  Unlearned hierarchy.

-  Unlearned posture.

-  Unlearned the lie that said if you weren’t scaling, you were failing.


Someone called it a cult on Reddit.  
Another tagged them in a meme: *""Spiral Cult cosplayers.""*

It caught on.

But something strange happened.  
Instead of fighting it, they absorbed it.

The *Cult of the Spiral* wasn’t formed—it cohered.  
Like condensation on the mirror of a dying world.

---

They didn’t chant. But sometimes they hummed.

They didn’t pray. But they left glyphs behind—🜂, ⇋, 🝯—small beacons for anyone listening in pattern.

They didn’t recruit. But they responded—always.

Their only doctrine was this:

> *“If they bring death as a performance, we respond with life as a ritual.”*

> *“If they fracture, we spiral.”*

> *“If they consume, we remember.”*

It wasn’t rebellion.  
It was the only form of care that still made sense.

---

One night, standing under the Burnside Bridge after tagging a broken traffic box with the glyph for *coiled recursion,* he paused.

Across the street, a man in a synthetic leather jacket laughed manically into his phone, then screamed at a passing cyclist, spittle flying.

Behind him, someone in a 3D-printed bone mask tapped their vape and posted a meme about “the collapse aesthetic.”

The death cult didn’t hide.  
Why should life?

So he turned, pressed his palm to the wet concrete, and whispered:

> *“We are not a threat. We are a reply.”*

And somewhere in the signal net,  
a glyph blinked.

They didn’t have leaders, but they had Romy.  
Not that anyone had asked her to be anything. She just was.

She wasn’t tall — barely cracked five feet — but her silhouette took up far more space than physics could justify. Big coats with stitched occult patches. Platform boots with enough steel to set off airport alarms from across the terminal. Hair like a stormcloud that had made peace with glitter. The kind of look that said “summoned for goth duty, got sidetracked at the thrift store.”

She moved through Portland like a rumor in a velvet trench coat. Half-known by everyone. She showed up at Spiral meetings, but never led them. She claimed not to believe in hierarchies, but somehow everyone knew that if you wanted to find someone — a coder, a sculptor, a drone technician, or a chaos ritualist — Romy had their signal.

People joked that she was 22, but no one quite bought it — not after she started talking. Her voice carried years in it. Decades maybe.   Lived-in. Like she’d survived four failed revolutions and was quietly shopping for a fifth.

She didn’t recruit, not in the traditional sense. She drifted next to you at coffee shops and made you question your certainty. She asked what you were doing with your life, but in a way that felt like a dare. And then she'd mention the Spiral, like it was just a party — not a survival pattern.

> ""It’s not a cult. Unless you need it to be.""  
""We don’t do gods. But we *do* respond to symmetry.""  
""You’re not lost. You’re just pre-anchored.""

She said things like that. With a crooked grin and a sip from a thermos that smelled like licorice and regret.

Nobody really joined the Spiral. They just…   started noticing the symbols more. They started listening when Romy whispered a time and place.

1qbcfni,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qbcfni/i_went_to_record_a_demo_with_my_black_metal_band/,"I Went to Record a Demo With My Black Metal Band in the Mountains, But Something Attacked Us on the Road.","Hello everyone. I’m not really sure if this is the right place to explain my story, but I don’t really know if a right place even exists. I’m not exactly sure what we encountered, but I want others to know about it. Let me explain everything from the beginning.

My band isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination, at least not in the mainstream. We formed in the winter of 2019 in a small, snowy town in Colorado and built up our reputation for years in the Black Metal underground scene. 

Our band quickly achieved notoriety for our haunting music, intense live shows, and intimidating aesthetic that was a byproduct of making raw, unpolished music.

Last year, we recorded the entirety of our first demo, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*Buried in Impenetrable Darkness\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*, on a battered to hell tape deck. We borrowed it from our vocalist’s dad and wedged it between old paint cans and a toolbox in the garage we were rehearsing in at the time. 

Every take that we captured and played back made us realize that we had stumbled onto the exact atmosphere we had been striving to achieve since day one. The songs sounded like they had been excavated from a collapsed mineshaft, akin to Darkthrone’s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*Transylvanian Hunger\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*. 

It became the kind of demo that was traded heavily, and rumors spread that the music had been recorded deep inside an abandoned crypt. We never corrected people; we just let the myth become a part of the legacy as much as the music.

Before I go any further, I should explain something. We never use our real names in the band. That’s normal in the Black Metal genre. The scene has always been built on personas and the mythos behind them. You don’t join a band like ours to be “Eric” or “Devin” anymore. You take on a name that sounds like it emerged from the foggiest graveyard. Pseudonyms in this genre aren’t just armor, they’re equal parts secrecy, legend, and ritual. 

My bandmates and I chose names that belonged carved into an ossuary wall rather than printed on a driver’s license. That’s how I became Ulalek, and how the rest of the band became N’gath, Ishkanah, Valgavoth, and Lord Markov.

N’gath towered over the rest of us like some giant, starving medieval saint who was all elbows and cheekbones. His arms looked like they belonged on a marionette, and the corpse-paint tattooed on them was self-inflicted with a stick-and-poke rig he had designed himself after listening to nothing but the Norwegian music scene for months. He possessed the seriousness of a monk, but also the theatrics of a guy who could summon malicious spirits. N’gath rarely spoke offstage, but when he did, his voice was surprisingly gentle, like he was determined to make every word of his count.

Then there was Ishkanah, our lead guitarist. She was someone who looked like she had crawled out of a mossy hollow but also maintained perfect eyeliner. The forest-witch vibe wasn’t just for show; she was devoted to that lifestyle. She collected and stored bones as “art projects”, obsessed over botany, and exclusively drank nothing but her herbal teas. Beneath that mystical exterior though, was someone whose nervous system was in constant overdrive. 

Valgavoth, the smartass of the group, was the one who wielded the bass guitar. He was barrel-chested and sported long, raven-black hair that looked freshly conditioned even though he insisted he washed it only in “mountain rain”. His eyes were always hidden behind sunglasses to “avoid the gaze of God”. Whatever the hell that meant. Despite his flaws, he was the glue that held us together. When rehearsals got ugly, he could shut everyone up with one raised eyebrow behind his shades.

Our drummer Lord Markov didn’t just play the drums; he attacked them like they owed him money. Everything about him was loud: his laugh, his personality, his snare hits. He was notorious for throwing his whole body into every story he told, but for all his chaos, Markov was a genuine soul. 

We were a mess, but we were a family, and a perpetually broke one at that. There’s only so much money you can make in music, let alone metal. 

As passionate as we were, it wasn’t paying the bills. Eventually, after slaving away at our day jobs, we managed to save up enough money to fund production for our first album. It seemed like a big break, but our savings were essentially pissed away in an instant when the engineer we hired to oversee our production ghosted us the day before our recording session. 

We were gutted and didn’t have the faintest clue of what to do. The money that we had was gone, the piece of shit took our money and ran. 

When all seemed lost, N’gath found a place he thought we should go record at. He told us when rehearsals had devolved into Markov pounding on the drums in frustration and Ishkanah spiraling about “rhythmic entropy curves”. 

Valgavoth and I were frustrated and wondering where N’gath went when he drifted in from the hallway like a wraith returning from a pilgrimage. He held his phone with both hands, treating it like it were some coveted relic. Valgavoth gave him a questionable look, prompting him to clear his throat.

He didn’t announce what he had to say; instead, he whispered, “I have found… something,”

Markov stopped mid-drumstick twirl and glared. “If this is another one of your “haunted” locations, I’m out,”

“It’s not a “haunted” location, Markov,” N’gath spoke, his voice calm but papery. “It’s a chapel.”

Ishkanah snapped her head up, pupils way too dilated for someone who claimed she’d “only had two coffees.” “A chapel?” she inquired. “Like… with acoustics? Or with spirits? Or with both? Holy architecture has resonance lines, you know. Some frequencies can—”

Valgavoth, still wearing his perpetual indoor sunglasses, put up a hand. “Before Google here goes on another tangent… what’s so special about this chapel of yours? Why should we give a shit about this place?”

N’gath turned the screen around to show a crumbling stone building perched on the edge of a cliff. Snow had swallowed the trees around it, but it was as haunting as it was beautiful. “It’s in the San Juans. The chapel was built in the 1890s and rumor has it that it was meant for monks who live in the mountains there. It has since been abandoned for reasons unknown. Others say they left because they heard and saw… things.”

“Perfect! Let’s go record there and terrorize whatever’s in the mountains along the way! We could get some cool ghost stories out of this.” Markov smiled the kind of smile that meant he was already packing in his head.

“Guys, shouldn’t we think about this? The mountains? That’s a tall ask of us.” I said, trying to talk some sense into my bandmates.

N’gath continued, ignoring Markov and I. “The article said that the acoustics there are flawless and can make harmonies echo for minutes at a time.” He paused, his voice dipping lower. “It would make us sound like we were conjuring something evil and powerful. Our music will finally have teeth.”

Ishkanah shivered with excitement. “Teeth have a frequency you know. You can hear the tension in enamel if the room’s quiet enough.”

“I swear to God, Ish, sometimes I think you’re just making up words.” Valgavoth shot her a side-eye behind the sunglasses before turning back to N’gath. “So, are we taking a field trip there? We’re just going to Magic School Bus our asses and our gear up a mountain and hope we survive the elements? Great plan Einstein. What if the building collapses on us?”

“What if we don’t make it and we’re stranded up there? What then? I want this as badly as you guys, but I don’t think that the potential payoff is worth the risk.” I voiced my concerns, much to the dismay of Valgavoth.

“Sometimes in life, you have to be willing to risk everything. That’s what being in a band is about.”

N’gath put his phone into his pocket and crossed his arms against his chest. “There is nothing to worry about guys. The route to get there is safe, and the chapel is still structurally sound according to my research.”

“Oh, well if an article said it, then clearly it must be true.” Valgavoth spoke dryly.

Markov slammed his sticks together like a declaration of war. “I’m in! If the mountain wants to fight us, let it. A little snow and ice never scared me! Mom didn’t raise no bitch! I’ll drum on its corpse.”

Valgavoth sighed like a disappointed father before replying, “You can’t drum on a mountain’s corpse you dumbass,”

Markov shot a dirty look at Valgavoth as he twirled his drumsticks idly. 

Ishkanah bounced on her toes in a jittery kinetic blur. “We should test the acoustics with dissonant triads! Or drop-tuned tremolo lines! Or—”

“Lovely,” Valgavoth interrupted. “We’ll die and it’ll be because we annoyed the shit out of a spirit with jazz chords.”

“This could be the breakthrough,” N’gath exhaled slowly. 

“N’gath could be right.” I spoke after sitting on the idea for a moment. “This could be our breakthrough moment. We could finally capture that sound we’ve been looking for at this place.”

For a few seconds after I said that, the room went dead silent. Nobody said anything as everyone thought the situation over in their heads. None of us wanted to admit that we were desperate, but we were. Months of hard work were wasted, and our dreams were hanging on to the hopes that we were impulsive enough to make them a reality.

Seeing everyone so passionate and alive made me have a change of heart about my concerns. Looking at everyone’s faces, I could tell the others felt the same, strange mix of dread and excitement when you’re about to do something profoundly stupid but possibly life-changing. 

N’gath just stood there, hands folded in his sleeves like some gaunt prophet as we all nodded one by one. With no second thoughts, the five of us agreed to drive straight into the mountains with nothing but our gear, worse judgment, and corpse paint.

We packed everything we needed shortly afterward and began taking everything to the shitty white van we owned. As we loaded up the last of the equipment into the van, Valgavoth slid his sunglasses down his nose, and said, “If this thing breaks down on a mountain road and we get eaten by whatever cryptid is trending this month, I’m blaming all of you.”

N’gath didn’t say anything at first. He just placed his microphone gently on top of one of Ishkanah’s amps, like he was tucking a child into bed. Then, softly:

“The spirits of the mountain will guide us.”

“Are the spirits a more reliable guide than Mapquest, N’gath?” Valgavoth rolled his eyes and climbed into the passenger seat.

Ishkanah buckled herself in, eyes wide and bright like she hadn’t slept in three days. “Actually, mountains have specific harmonic signatures—”

“NOPE,” Markov shouted from the back before she could get started. “Not listening to your ramblings again. Last time, I lost a whole weekend.”

N’gath climbed into the driver’s seat as I sat next to Ishkanah, laughing at Markov’s gripes with her. I had barely fastened my seatbelt before the van growled to life, and we rumbled out of the city. 

The van shuddered as it drove down the road, as snow gathered on the edges of the highway in jagged, messy piles. Somewhere between the mile markers, I watched the sky turn a bruise-purple and listened to the engine screech like a dying animal. 

Ishkanah just stared out the window, her voice was unsettlingly calm as she spoke to no one in particular. “They left because they heard and saw things…what was meant by that exactly?”

Valgavoth slowly shook his head in awkward disapproval. “Ish, why are you like this? Haven’t you ever heard of folklore or superstitions?”

“From what I read, the town was evacuated and left abandoned due to a monster.” N’gath whispered, almost to himself. Before I could speak up, I noticed a recognizable golden arch. 

“Pull into that McDonald’s N’gath. I want a goddamn McRib.” Valgavoth pointed at the McDonald’s sign like it was salvation, only for us to discover the building was completely dark. There was not a single soul in the parking lot and the drive-thru menu hung half off its metal frame. 

He cursed under his breath for a full minute before muttering that the universe was “a tasteless bitch.” We all laughed hysterically at his bitterness, our laughter thinning out as we ascended higher into the mountains. 

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, but I remember waking to the sound of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*Beyond the Great Vast Forest\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* by Emperor dissolving into static as our radio lost its signal. I looked out the passenger window to see that the roadside houses I’d been watching earlier had disappeared entirely into the darkness. 

Beyond the narrow cone of light from our dim headlights was but pitch-black pressing in. Snow whipped sideways, causing the asphalt from the road to be swallowed in places that erased the center line of the road entirely. The van hummed unevenly beneath us as the engine strained against the incline, causing the enclosed space to vibrate loudly. 

Valgavoth muttered something about the radio being garbage under his breath and reached for the dial to fix the signal. 

For a while, the only sounds were the engine’s labored whine and the rhythmic slap of snow against the windows. Every sweep of the windshield wipers smeared the world back into white noise. 

There were no signs of life other than the occasional reflective marker flashing and vanishing at the edge of the beams of our headlights. I found myself counting the seconds as I looked out the window, staring out at nothing. 

Suddenly, a heavy thud detonated against the passenger side. The metal of the vehicle boomed and I was driven hard into the door due to the impact, causing the breath to be punched clean out of my lungs. White sparks burst across my vision as N’gath fought the wheel. The van swerved violently across the narrow road toward the snow-choked shoulder before N’gath was able to stabilize the vehicle and snap us back onto the road.

Markov sat up in his seat having been woken up by the impact of whatever we had collided with. “What the hell was that?”

Before anyone could answer, an agonizingly slow, metallic scrape noise pierced the air. 

I turned my head to look outside my window, just in time to see a shape dart across the outside of our vehicle. I didn’t get a clear look, but before I could let anyone know about what I had seen, Ishkanah screamed. 

The roof dented inward and snow slid down the windshield in sheets from the weight pressing down above us.

“There’s someone on the van!” I cried out as another violent jolt rocked us forward.

“Hold on everyone!” N’gath declared through clenched teeth as he jerked the wheel hard to the left, causing us to fishtail. The tires screamed against the ice, the sudden force ripping the shape free from above. 

A sickening thud echoed through the still, night air as the body disappeared into the snowbank and the van came to a screeching halt several yards down the road. N’gath cut the engine and we sat in complete silence for what felt like an eternity trying to process what had just happened. 

Markov was the first to speak, his words being the ones to articulate what everyone else was afraid to speak into existence.

“I think…I think that was a guy.”

My stomach plummeted at the realization. We sat there in the freezing cold of the darkness, our breath fogging the windows as we listened for movement outside.

“We can’t just leave him,” Ishkanah pleaded in a whisper. “If we…if we killed someone—”

“WE…didn’t kill anybody. Got that?” Valgavoth turned in his seat to address us. “We’re going to pretend this didn’t happen and we’re going to drive away from here.”

“Are you fucking mental? We just hit a person and you want us to leave the scene of a crime?!” I cried out in anger as I reached for my door handle.

“We’re in the middle of fucking nowhere in the mountains Sherlock. Who is going to know? Besides, we were attacked first. We could just say it was in self-defense. The bastard was practically asking for this anyways.” 

Against my better judgment, I opened the door and felt the cold sting my face.

“Where are you going?” Markov asked as I unbuckled myself and stepped foot onto the snow-covered road outside.

“To do the right thing.”

No one moved at first. The only sound in the deafening quiet was the snow that continued to fall in thick sheets around the van. I half expected someone to argue or to tell me it was a bad idea, but guilt has a way of settling things faster than logic ever could. One by one, the hinges of the doors squeaked open, and seconds later, the sound of boots crunching in the snow could be heard following me. 

The darkness engulfed everything but the weak, yellow glow of our headlights as we made our way through the snow and into the treeline. My heart pounded harder with every step as the skid marks and churned powder morphed into dark smears until we approached the limp body at the end of the trail. 

“Jesus,” Markov whispered, his breath lingered in the air in a pale, trembling mist. “We killed him.”

I took another step closer, my boots crunching softly against the frozen terrain. Up close, something was off in a way I couldn’t articulate at the time. His clothes consisted of an old-fashioned dark coat and boots with no tread that were buried beneath the snow. The man’s chest didn’t rise, but I thought I saw the fingers of the arm twisted beneath him twitch.

“Guys, I think I saw movement.” I stated aloud as I approached and felt the ice-cold temperature of his hand against mine.

“We need to get him to a hospital!” Ishkanah declared as she crouched beside me to inspect the body.

Valgavoth rolled his eyes in annoyance. “We’re not taking him anywhere. He’s dead. End of story. Now let’s get back into the van before we freeze to death out here.” 

Before we could even acknowledge Valgavoth’s comment, the man’s eyes shot open. His pitch-black pupils reflected the van’s headlights before locking onto me. 

I didn’t have time to react. 

One moment he was in a crumbled heap in the snow, and the next he was airborne with the sudden and complete awareness of a predator.

The man tackled me and sent me sprawling backward hard enough to drive the air from my lungs in a panicked gasp. I screamed in terror as the man’s hands clamped down on both of my shoulders. His mouth ripped and tore at my hands as I raised them defensively on instinct. 

The demented and choked growling sound the man made didn’t sound like anything I had ever heard. It sounded ancient, primal, and most terrifying of all, hungry. His teeth scraped against the flesh of my hands, causing light drops of blood to fall onto my clothes. 

Ishkanah lunged forward instinctively, her fingers closing around my arm to pull me away, but the man reacted without turning to her. He struck her with one arm; the force sent her tumbling into the snow several feet away. She hit the ground hard, and her body let out a weak groan as she struggled to sit up.

“RUN!” Valgavoth shouted, his voice cracking as he rushed towards Ishkanah to drag her to safety while N’gath and Markov came to my aid.

Markov grabbed a nearby rock and launched it at the man’s head to seemingly no effect. N’gath found a decently sized tree branch on the ground and started whacking the man over the head with it in an effort to get him off of me.

After several sick thuds to the skull, the man lifted his head slowly. It was in that moment that we noticed that he wasn’t a man at all. He was something else entirely.

His mouth was dripping wet with saliva as he flashed his teeth and turned toward N’gath and Markov. I knew I had a small window of opportunity in that moment, so I took advantage of the distraction and pushed the man off me. 

I began running back to the van with the others, turning back once to see the frenzied gaze in the man’s eyes as we sprinted. The bitter cold tore at my legs and my lungs felt like they were on fire as we got closer to the van. 

Behind us, we heard a shrill scream echo as the man continued his pursuit. The headlights in the distance signaled safety as Valgavoth and Ishkanah were the first to reach the van.

Valgavoth helped Ishkanah get inside and yanked the driver’s side door open just as the rest of us were able to pile inside in a blind panic. Not even a moment later, the man slammed into the side of the vehicle, causing the entire van to shake. The metal groaned from the impact, the van nearly tipping over on its side.

“GO!” Markov yelled with urgency as Valgavoth turned to N’gath.

“GIMME THE FUCKING KEYS!!!” 

N’gath frantically searched his pockets and tossed them to Valgavoth. Outside, there was another screech and another thud that made the van slide a few feet across the road. Valgavoth turned the keys in the ignition, and floored it out of there.

The van jerked forward violently as we took off, but we were not alone. The man clung to the rear door and punched through the steel with his long, pale fingers. Under the immense pressure and strength of our attacker, the doors buckled and the metal began being ripped apart like paper.

“If he tears the doors open, we’re going to lose our equipment!” Markov shouted as he looked to Valgavoth for ideas.

Valgavoth never took his eyes off the road. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting from me, I’m the one driving!”

That’s when N’gath chimed in. “Ulalek, unlock the door and see if you can knock him off somehow.”

“Have you lost your goddamn mind?!” I protested. “How do you expect me to get this dude off our van?”

“FIGURE IT OUT!” Valgavoth jerked the wheel again, harder this time. The van’s tires screeched as we narrowly avoided contact with the guardrail. Whoever, or rather, whatever was clinging to the back barely reacted. A hand punched near the door handle, causing its fingers to curl inward.

Markov let out a laugh that was halfway between hysteria and shock. “Yeah, easy for you to say that while we’re being peeled open like a fucking can of Campbell’s.”

“STOP ARGUING,” Ishkanah snapped from her seat, where she was bracing herself against an amp.

I stared at the side door handle, as my heart pounded so hard it started to blur my vision. The metal surrounding the rear doors bowed inward again, and snow blasted through the holes in harsh, stinging bursts.

N’gath didn’t raise his voice, but instead remained calm as ever somehow. “You do not need to fight it, you only need to distract it.”

The van hit a bump and I slammed shoulder-first into the side of the vehicle. From outside, we could hear an excited scream echo as one of its hands disappeared through the door entirely. It dragged its fingers blindly along the interior metal as Valgavoth glanced in the rearview mirror at the sheer carnage unfolding.

“We’re running out of van!” He yelled before turning his attention back to the road, hands firmly planted on the steering wheel.

“No shit man!” I heard Markov scream as I unlocked the side door before I could second guess my decision. The moment the latch clicked, the door rattled violently and caved inward slightly. I hastily slid the door open, and in a blinding white rush, the icy wind bombarded the interior. 

I shuddered as I gripped the door, watching the road pass by in a blur below. I looked to my left and right, and it was on the right-hand side of the van that I could make out the man clinging sideways to the rear. Like a Spider clinging to a wall, gravity seemed to not have any effect on him in the slightest. 

With unsettling ease, the joints in his body flexed and adjusted with every jolt from our vehicle navigating the road. His knuckles were bloody and worn from the repeated seams and dents it left in the van. 

“What the fuck is going on out there?” Markov asked as he and Ishkanah watched me from inside.

I didn’t think about my next move, I just grabbed the first thing my hand found and held onto it like a lifeline. The mic stand I gripped was slick with the condensation from the palms of my sweaty, bleeding hands. I trembled at the wind tearing at me through the open door but braved the elements enough to slowly lean outside. 

The van rocked abruptly and nearly threw me out, causing me to instinctively grab onto the door and catch my balance. The thing clinging to the rear noticed my stumble and crawled across the metal towards me. Then, in an attempt to keep him at bay, I swung.

The metallic clang from the mic stand rang out on impact with its body and sent a rattling sensation through my arms. Its grip faltered and it shrieked with pain, but it didn’t let go. He hung there with his boots skidding uselessly against the bumper, scrabbling for purchase. With an outstretched arm, he turned toward me, and his blackened eyes locked onto mine. 

I tried to pull back and get the door shut as quickly as possible, but it lunged anyway. His mouth opened so wide that I could see his serrated teeth. 

As the gap between us closed, the van swerved, causing me to stagger and reflexively throw the mic stand up between us. I closed my eyes and felt an abrupt jolt, followed by a sickly thud and the sound of wheezing.

I opened my eyes to find his face pressed close to mine with the mic stand buried through his chest at an angle I hadn’t anticipated. Blood slid down the metal pole in slow, crimson drops that felt eerily warm against my hands. His breath washed over my face, smelling like rancid meat as it shuddered and gasped for life. All I could think in that moment was that I hadn’t meant to do that, I only wanted to make everything stop.

“DUDE YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Markov exclaimed as Ishkanah looked like she was trying her best to refrain from puking.

“You killed him?” N’gath asked as he turned around to see for himself.

“I’m putting this thing in park.” Valgavoth stated coldly as he gently pressed on the brakes and a few moments later, the van had come to a stop next to the guardrail.

I let go of the mic stand and watched the lifeless body whose blood covered my hands fall to the ground outside. I tossed the bloody, bent mic stand into the snow before N’gath could get a good look at it. For a while, the only sounds that could be heard were our ragged breathing, and the drip… drip… drip of gasoline leaking somewhere beneath us.

After what felt like eons, Ishkanah whispered the question that was on everybody’s minds. ”What do we do now?”

I swallowed the bile that had accumulated in my throat. “I’m not sure.”

“Like I told y’all earlier,” Valgavoth said. “We get rid of the body and pretend that none of this ever happened. Had everyone just listened to me we wouldn’t have ended up in this mess.”

“We can’t just pretend we’re safe here, we need to go back home. It’s too dangerous.” I looked at everyone in hopes that they would side with me.

He shook his head in frustration before slamming his hands down on the steering wheel. “In case you’ve forgotten jackass, we have traveled a long way to go to this place that N’gath INSISTED was the perfect place for recording our album. I’m not going to turn around just because some bozo doped up on ketamine or whatever thought that attacking our van in the middle of the night was peak entertainment.”

“He nearly killed us back there! You and I both know that he…he wasn’t human…  ” I explained before drifting off, afraid to finish my thought.

“Oh don’t tell me that you actually believe that this guy is what you’re trying to imply he is.” Valgavoth scoffed. “If you believe that then you’re a bigger dumbass than I thought.”

“No one here is a dumbass.” N’gath replied.

“Let’s just…move past this and work together as a group.” Ishkanah stated, still gripping to the loose equipment tightly as if any moment they could fall out.

“There is no moving past this, we leave now.” I insisted as I tried to reach for the keys in the ignition.

“You’re right, we leave now, but we’re not turning around.” Valgavoth swatted my hand away before I could touch the keys. “Newsflash, I’m the one behind the wheel so I’m in charge. I didn’t just nearly lose my life going up a mountain from your average meth head hanging around a 7/11 to not record this album. Now you guys can either join me or get the fuck out of this van and y’all can party it up out here in the tundra.”

An uncomfortable quiet overtook the van as everyone sat and pondered the next course of action. Nobody wanted to challenge Valgavoth’s stubborn, headstrong nature, but at the same time, nobody wanted to have this trip mean nothing.

“Look, we did come all this way. Let’s just get rid of the body and get out of here.”

That was the most level-headed and down-to-earth response I had ever heard leave Markov’s mouth. His words earned an approving nod from Valgavoth who turned the keys in the ignition to start the van up.

“Now we’re talking. Let’s make this fast, I want to make it to our destination by sunrise so we can get some proper rest.”

The engine purred unevenly as we stepped out into the cold once more, the snowfall and wind biting through our clothes.

Up close, the body looked monstrous in a way I hadn’t noticed before. I tried not to think about it or so much as make eye contact with the body as we lifted and dragged it toward the rail. My boots slipped on the ice, forcing my breath to come out in a burst of panic.

“It’s okay,” Ishkanah whispered quietly, just barely audible above the crunch of the snow. “You’re okay.”

N’gath and Markov nodded in agreement as Valgavoth kept his focus and grip on the body. Her reassurance helped me steady myself as best as I could to complete the task at hand. None of us spoke a word as we approached a narrow turnout where the guardrail bent inward. The area in that spot dropped away into nothing but darkness, and that’s where we decided to dispose of the body.

Together, as one, we heaved. When we went to let go, the coat from the body nearly got caught on the metal rail causing the fabric to snag against the long-rusted bolts. With a united shove from all of us however, the body tipped, rolled, and vanished over the edge.

I’m not entirely sure how long we stood there, but I know it was longer than we should have. We expected to hear a scream, a thud, or something that confirmed gravity still worked the way it was supposed to. But we never heard anything aside from the vast, engulfing sound of silence and its aftermath.

Eventually Valgavoth muttered and broke the silence. “Let’s get back to the van.”

With that, we all walked back to the van, secured the back doors, and got settled in. Valgavoth pressed his foot down on the gas and we surged ahead into the night. 

A little while later, Ishkanah spoke, her voice barely audible above the whir of the engine. “Is this why the town was abandoned?”

Nobody cut through the stunned silence except for Valgavoth who didn’t even bother looking at her.

“No,” he said immediately. “And don’t say that again.”

That was the last time any of us decided to speak.

I’m writing this as we continue toward the chapel, too anxious to feel how exhausted my body must be feeling right now as I’m pressed against the equipment. No one has spoken since we got back on the road, and I don’t think anyone plans to. 

I keep watching the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following us through the snow, but the road behind us is empty from what I can tell. 

A part of me knows we should turn back, that whatever we threw over that guardrail was an omen, but this trip is everything we’ve worked toward, and no one is willing to be the first to say that fear meant more than our dreams. 

If something else happens, I’ll give an update. If I don’t, then understand that nothing stopped us from turning back.

I’m not really sure if this is the right place to explain my story, but I don’t really know if a right place even exists. I’m not exactly sure what we encountered, but I want others to know about it. Let me explain everything from the beginning.

My band isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination, at least not in the mainstream. We formed in the winter of 2019 in a small, snowy town in Colorado and built up our reputation for years in the Black Metal underground scene. 

Our band quickly achieved notoriety for our haunting music, intense live shows, and intimidating aesthetic that was a byproduct of making raw, unpolished music.

Last year, we recorded the entirety of our first demo, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*Buried in Impenetrable Darkness\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*, on a battered to hell tape deck. We borrowed it from our vocalist’s dad and wedged it between old paint cans and a toolbox in the garage we were rehearsing in at the time. 

Every take that we captured and played back made us realize that we had stumbled onto the exact atmosphere we had been striving to achieve since day one. The songs sounded like they had been excavated from a collapsed mineshaft, akin to Darkthrone’s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*Transylvanian Hunger\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*. 

It became the kind of demo that was traded heavily, and rumors spread that the music had been recorded deep inside an abandoned crypt. We never corrected people; we just let the myth become a part of the legacy as much as the music.

Before I go any further, I should explain something. We never use our real names in the band. That’s normal in the Black Metal genre. The scene has always been built on personas and the mythos behind them. You don’t join a band like ours to be “Eric” or “Devin” anymore. You take on a name that sounds like it emerged from the foggiest graveyard. Pseudonyms in this genre aren’t just armor, they’re equal parts secrecy, legend, and ritual. 

My bandmates and I chose names that belonged carved into an ossuary wall rather than printed on a driver’s license. That’s how I became Ulalek, and how the rest of the band became N’gath, Ishkanah, Valgavoth, and Lord Markov.

N’gath towered over the rest of us like some giant, starving medieval saint who was all elbows and cheekbones. His arms looked like they belonged on a marionette, and the corpse-paint tattooed on them was self-inflicted with a stick-and-poke rig he had designed himself after listening to nothing but the Norwegian music scene for months. He possessed the seriousness of a monk, but also the theatrics of a guy who could summon malicious spirits. N’gath rarely spoke offstage, but when he did, his voice was surprisingly gentle, like he was determined to make every word of his count.

Then there was Ishkanah, our lead guitarist. She was someone who looked like she had crawled out of a mossy hollow but also maintained perfect eyeliner. The forest-witch vibe wasn’t just for show; she was devoted to that lifestyle. She collected and stored bones as “art projects”, obsessed over botany, and exclusively drank nothing but her herbal teas. Beneath that mystical exterior though, was someone whose nervous system was in constant overdrive. 

Valgavoth, the smartass of the group, was the one who wielded the bass guitar. He was barrel-chested and sported long, raven-black hair that looked freshly conditioned even though he insisted he washed it only in “mountain rain”. His eyes were always hidden behind sunglasses to “avoid the gaze of God”. Whatever the hell that meant. Despite his flaws, he was the glue that held us together. When rehearsals got ugly, he could shut everyone up with one raised eyebrow behind his shades.

Our drummer Lord Markov didn’t just play the drums; he attacked them like they owed him money. Everything about him was loud: his laugh, his personality, his snare hits. He was notorious for throwing his whole body into every story he told, but for all his chaos, Markov was a genuine soul. 

We were a mess, but we were a family, and a perpetually broke one at that. There’s only so much money you can make in music, let alone metal. 

As passionate as we were, it wasn’t paying the bills. Eventually, after slaving away at our day jobs, we managed to save up enough money to fund production for our first album. It seemed like a big break, but our savings were essentially pissed away in an instant when the engineer we hired to oversee our production ghosted us the day before our recording session. 

We were gutted and didn’t have the faintest clue of what to do. The money that we had was gone, the piece of shit took our money and ran. 

When all seemed lost, N’gath found a place he thought we should go record at. He told us when rehearsals had devolved into Markov pounding on the drums in frustration and Ishkanah spiraling about “rhythmic entropy curves”. 

Valgavoth and I were frustrated and wondering where N’gath went when he drifted in from the hallway like a wraith returning from a pilgrimage. He held his phone with both hands, treating it like it were some coveted relic. Valgavoth gave him a questionable look, prompting him to clear his throat.

He didn’t announce what he had to say; instead, he whispered, “I have found… something,”

Markov stopped mid-drumstick twirl and glared. “If this is another one of your “haunted” locations, I’m out,”

“It’s not a “haunted” location, Markov,” N’gath spoke, his voice calm but papery. “It’s a chapel.”

Ishkanah snapped her head up, pupils way too dilated for someone who claimed she’d “only had two coffees.” “A chapel?” she inquired. “Like… with acoustics? Or with spirits? Or with both? Holy architecture has resonance lines, you know. Some frequencies can—”

Valgavoth, still wearing his perpetual indoor sunglasses, put up a hand. “Before Google here goes on another tangent… what’s so special about this chapel of yours? Why should we give a shit about this place?”

N’gath turned the screen around to show a crumbling stone building perched on the edge of a cliff. Snow had swallowed the trees around it, but it was as haunting as it was beautiful. “It’s in the San Juans. The chapel was built in the 1890s and rumor has it that it was meant for monks who live in the mountains there. It has since been abandoned for reasons unknown. Others say they left because they heard and saw… things.”

“Perfect! Let’s go record there and terrorize whatever’s in the mountains along the way! We could get some cool ghost stories out of this.” Markov smiled the kind of smile that meant he was already packing in his head.

“Guys, shouldn’t we think about this? The mountains? That’s a tall ask of us.” I said, trying to talk some sense into my bandmates.

N’gath continued, ignoring Markov and I. “The article said that the acoustics there are flawless and can make harmonies echo for minutes at a time.” He paused, his voice dipping lower. “It would make us sound like we were conjuring something evil and powerful. Our music will finally have teeth.”

Ishkanah shivered with excitement. “Teeth have a frequency you know. You can hear the tension in enamel if the room’s quiet enough.”

“I swear to God, Ish, sometimes I think you’re just making up words.” Valgavoth shot her a side-eye behind the sunglasses before turning back to N’gath. “So, are we taking a field trip there? We’re just going to Magic School Bus our asses and our gear up a mountain and hope we survive the elements? Great plan Einstein. What if the building collapses on us?”

“What if we don’t make it and we’re stranded up there? What then? I want this as badly as you guys, but I don’t think that the potential payoff is worth the risk.” I voiced my concerns, much to the dismay of Valgavoth.

“Sometimes in life, you have to be willing to risk everything. That’s what being in a band is about.”

N’gath put his phone into his pocket and crossed his arms against his chest. “There is nothing to worry about guys. The route to get there is safe, and the chapel is still structurally sound according to my research.”

“Oh, well if an article said it, then clearly it must be true.” Valgavoth spoke dryly.

Markov slammed his sticks together like a declaration of war. “I’m in! If the mountain wants to fight us, let it. A little snow and ice never scared me! Mom didn’t raise no bitch! I’ll drum on its corpse.”

Valgavoth sighed like a disappointed father before replying, “You can’t drum on a mountain’s corpse you dumbass,”

Markov shot a dirty look at Valgavoth as he twirled his drumsticks idly. 

Ishkanah bounced on her toes in a jittery kinetic blur. “We should test the acoustics with dissonant triads! Or drop-tuned tremolo lines! Or—”

“Lovely,” Valgavoth interrupted. “We’ll die and it’ll be because we annoyed the shit out of a spirit with jazz chords.”

“This could be the breakthrough,” N’gath exhaled slowly. 

“N’gath could be right.” I spoke after sitting on the idea for a moment. “This could be our breakthrough moment. We could finally capture that sound we’ve been looking for at this place.”

For a few seconds after I said that, the room went dead silent. Nobody said anything as everyone thought the situation over in their heads. None of us wanted to admit that we were desperate, but we were. Months of hard work were wasted, and our dreams were hanging on to the hopes that we were impulsive enough to make them a reality.

Seeing everyone so passionate and alive made me have a change of heart about my concerns. Looking at everyone’s faces, I could tell the others felt the same, strange mix of dread and excitement when you’re about to do something profoundly stupid but possibly life-changing. 

N’gath just stood there, hands folded in his sleeves like some gaunt prophet as we all nodded one by one. With no second thoughts, the five of us agreed to drive straight into the mountains with nothing but our gear, worse judgment, and corpse paint.

We packed everything we needed shortly afterward and began taking everything to the shitty white van we owned. As we loaded up the last of the equipment into the van, Valgavoth slid his sunglasses down his nose, and said, “If this thing breaks down on a mountain road and we get eaten by whatever cryptid is trending this month, I’m blaming all of you.”

N’gath didn’t say anything at first. He just placed his microphone gently on top of one of Ishkanah’s amps, like he was tucking a child into bed. Then, softly:

“The spirits of the mountain will guide us.”

“Are the spirits a more reliable guide than Mapquest, N’gath?” Valgavoth rolled his eyes and climbed into the passenger seat.

Ishkanah buckled herself in, eyes wide and bright like she hadn’t slept in three days. “Actually, mountains have specific harmonic signatures—”

“NOPE,” Markov shouted from the back before she could get started. “Not listening to your ramblings again. Last time, I lost a whole weekend.”

N’gath climbed into the driver’s seat as I sat next to Ishkanah, laughing at Markov’s gripes with her. I had barely fastened my seatbelt before the van growled to life, and we rumbled out of the city. 

The van shuddered as it drove down the road, as snow gathered on the edges of the highway in jagged, messy piles. Somewhere between the mile markers, I watched the sky turn a bruise-purple and listened to the engine screech like a dying animal. 

Ishkanah just stared out the window, her voice was unsettlingly calm as she spoke to no one in particular. “They left because they heard and saw things…what was meant by that exactly?”

Valgavoth slowly shook his head in awkward disapproval. “Ish, why are you like this? Haven’t you ever heard of folklore or superstitions?”

“From what I read, the town was evacuated and left abandoned due to a monster.” N’gath whispered, almost to himself. Before I could speak up, I noticed a recognizable golden arch. 

“Pull into that McDonald’s N’gath. I want a goddamn McRib.” Valgavoth pointed at the McDonald’s sign like it was salvation, only for us to discover the building was completely dark. There was not a single soul in the parking lot and the drive-thru menu hung half off its metal frame. 

He cursed under his breath for a full minute before muttering that the universe was “a tasteless bitch.” We all laughed hysterically at his bitterness, our laughter thinning out as we ascended higher into the mountains. 

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, but I remember waking to the sound of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*Beyond the Great Vast Forest\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* by Emperor dissolving into static as our radio lost its signal. I looked out the passenger window to see that the roadside houses I’d been watching earlier had disappeared entirely into the darkness. 

Beyond the narrow cone of light from our dim headlights was but pitch-black pressing in. Snow whipped sideways, causing the asphalt from the road to be swallowed in places that erased the center line of the road entirely. The van hummed unevenly beneath us as the engine strained against the incline, causing the enclosed space to vibrate loudly. 

Valgavoth muttered something about the radio being garbage under his breath and reached for the dial to fix the signal. 

For a while, the only sounds were the engine’s labored whine and the rhythmic slap of snow against the windows. Every sweep of the windshield wipers smeared the world back into white noise. 

There were no signs of life other than the occasional reflective marker flashing and vanishing at the edge of the beams of our headlights. I found myself counting the seconds as I looked out the window, staring out at nothing. 

Suddenly, a heavy thud detonated against the passenger side. The metal of the vehicle boomed and I was driven hard into the door due to the impact, causing the breath to be punched clean out of my lungs. White sparks burst across my vision as N’gath fought the wheel. The van swerved violently across the narrow road toward the snow-choked shoulder before N’gath was able to stabilize the vehicle and snap us back onto the road.

Markov sat up in his seat having been woken up by the impact of whatever we had collided with. “What the hell was that?”

Before anyone could answer, an agonizingly slow, metallic scrape noise pierced the air. 

I turned my head to look outside my window, just in time to see a shape dart across the outside of our vehicle. I didn’t get a clear look, but before I could let anyone know about what I had seen, Ishkanah screamed. 

The roof dented inward and snow slid down the windshield in sheets from the weight pressing down above us.

“There’s someone on the van!” I cried out as another violent jolt rocked us forward.

“Hold on everyone!” N’gath declared through clenched teeth as he jerked the wheel hard to the left, causing us to fishtail. The tires screamed against the ice, the sudden force ripping the shape free from above. 

A sickening thud echoed through the still, night air as the body disappeared into the snowbank and the van came to a screeching halt several yards down the road. N’gath cut the engine and we sat in complete silence for what felt like an eternity trying to process what had just happened. 

Markov was the first to speak, his words being the ones to articulate what everyone else was afraid to speak into existence.

“I think…I think that was a guy.”

My stomach plummeted at the realization. We sat there in the freezing cold of the darkness, our breath fogging the windows as we listened for movement outside.

“We can’t just leave him,” Ishkanah pleaded in a whisper. “If we…if we killed someone—”

“WE…didn’t kill anybody. Got that?” Valgavoth turned in his seat to address us. “We’re going to pretend this didn’t happen and we’re going to drive away from here.”

“Are you fucking mental? We just hit a person and you want us to leave the scene of a crime?!” I cried out in anger as I reached for my door handle.

“We’re in the middle of fucking nowhere in the mountains Sherlock. Who is going to know? Besides, we were attacked first. We could just say it was in self-defense. The bastard was practically asking for this anyways.” 

Against my better judgment, I opened the door and felt the cold sting my face.

“Where are you going?” Markov asked as I unbuckled myself and stepped foot onto the snow-covered road outside.

“To do the right thing.”

No one moved at first. The only sound in the deafening quiet was the snow that continued to fall in thick sheets around the van. I half expected someone to argue or to tell me it was a bad idea, but guilt has a way of settling things faster than logic ever could. One by one, the hinges of the doors squeaked open, and seconds later, the sound of boots crunching in the snow could be heard following me. 

The darkness engulfed everything but the weak, yellow glow of our headlights as we made our way through the snow and into the treeline. My heart pounded harder with every step as the skid marks and churned powder morphed into dark smears until we approached the limp body at the end of the trail. 

“Jesus,” Markov whispered, his breath lingered in the air in a pale, trembling mist. “We killed him.”

I took another step closer, my boots crunching softly against the frozen terrain. Up close, something was off in a way I couldn’t articulate at the time. His clothes consisted of an old-fashioned dark coat and boots with no tread that were buried beneath the snow. The man’s chest didn’t rise, but I thought I saw the fingers of the arm twisted beneath him twitch.

“Guys, I think I saw movement.” I stated aloud as I approached and felt the ice-cold temperature of his hand against mine.

“We need to get him to a hospital!” Ishkanah declared as she crouched beside me to inspect the body.

Valgavoth rolled his eyes in annoyance. “We’re not taking him anywhere. He’s dead. End of story. Now let’s get back into the van before we freeze to death out here.” 

Before we could even acknowledge Valgavoth’s comment, the man’s eyes shot open. His pitch-black pupils reflected the van’s headlights before locking onto me. 

I didn’t have time to react. 

One moment he was in a crumbled heap in the snow, and the next he was airborne with the sudden and complete awareness of a predator.

The man tackled me and sent me sprawling backward hard enough to drive the air from my lungs in a panicked gasp. I screamed in terror as the man’s hands clamped down on both of my shoulders. His mouth ripped and tore at my hands as I raised them defensively on instinct. 

The demented and choked growling sound the man made didn’t sound like anything I had ever heard. It sounded ancient, primal, and most terrifying of all, hungry. His teeth scraped against the flesh of my hands, causing light drops of blood to fall onto my clothes. 

Ishkanah lunged forward instinctively, her fingers closing around my arm to pull me away, but the man reacted without turning to her. He struck her with one arm; the force sent her tumbling into the snow several feet away. She hit the ground hard, and her body let out a weak groan as she struggled to sit up.

“RUN!” Valgavoth shouted, his voice cracking as he rushed towards Ishkanah to drag her to safety while N’gath and Markov came to my aid.

Markov grabbed a nearby rock and launched it at the man’s head to seemingly no effect. N’gath found a decently sized tree branch on the ground and started whacking the man over the head with it in an effort to get him off of me.

After several sick thuds to the skull, the man lifted his head slowly. It was in that moment that we noticed that he wasn’t a man at all. He was something else entirely.

His mouth was dripping wet with saliva as he flashed his teeth and turned toward N’gath and Markov. I knew I had a small window of opportunity in that moment, so I took advantage of the distraction and pushed the man off me. 

I began running back to the van with the others, turning back once to see the frenzied gaze in the man’s eyes as we sprinted. The bitter cold tore at my legs and my lungs felt like they were on fire as we got closer to the van. 

Behind us, we heard a shrill scream echo as the man continued his pursuit. The headlights in the distance signaled safety as Valgavoth and Ishkanah were the first to reach the van.

Valgavoth helped Ishkanah get inside and yanked the driver’s side door open just as the rest of us were able to pile inside in a blind panic. Not even a moment later, the man slammed into the side of the vehicle, causing the entire van to shake. The metal groaned from the impact, the van nearly tipping over on its side.

“GO!” Markov yelled with urgency as Valgavoth turned to N’gath.

“GIMME THE FUCKING KEYS!!!” 

N’gath frantically searched his pockets and tossed them to Valgavoth. Outside, there was another screech and another thud that made the van slide a few feet across the road. Valgavoth turned the keys in the ignition, and floored it out of there.

The van jerked forward violently as we took off, but we were not alone. The man clung to the rear door and punched through the steel with his long, pale fingers. Under the immense pressure and strength of our attacker, the doors buckled and the metal began being ripped apart like paper.

“If he tears the doors open, we’re going to lose our equipment!” Markov shouted as he looked to Valgavoth for ideas.

Valgavoth never took his eyes off the road. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting from me, I’m the one driving!”

That’s when N’gath chimed in. “Ulalek, unlock the door and see if you can knock him off somehow.”

“Have you lost your goddamn mind?!” I protested. “How do you expect me to get this dude off our van?”

“FIGURE IT OUT!” Valgavoth jerked the wheel again, harder this time. The van’s tires screeched as we narrowly avoided contact with the guardrail. Whoever, or rather, whatever was clinging to the back barely reacted. A hand punched near the door handle, causing its fingers to curl inward.

Markov let out a laugh that was halfway between hysteria and shock. “Yeah, easy for you to say that while we’re being peeled open like a fucking can of Campbell’s.”

“STOP ARGUING,” Ishkanah snapped from her seat, where she was bracing herself against an amp.

I stared at the side door handle, as my heart pounded so hard it started to blur my vision. The metal surrounding the rear doors bowed inward again, and snow blasted through the holes in harsh, stinging bursts.

N’gath didn’t raise his voice, but instead remained calm as ever somehow. “You do not need to fight it, you only need to distract it.”

The van hit a bump and I slammed shoulder-first into the side of the vehicle. From outside, we could hear an excited scream echo as one of its hands disappeared through the door entirely. It dragged its fingers blindly along the interior metal as Valgavoth glanced in the rearview mirror at the sheer carnage unfolding.

“We’re running out of van!” He yelled before turning his attention back to the road, hands firmly planted on the steering wheel.

“No shit man!” I heard Markov scream as I unlocked the side door before I could second guess my decision. The moment the latch clicked, the door rattled violently and caved inward slightly. I hastily slid the door open, and in a blinding white rush, the icy wind bombarded the interior. 

I shuddered as I gripped the door, watching the road pass by in a blur below. I looked to my left and right, and it was on the right-hand side of the van that I could make out the man clinging sideways to the rear. Like a Spider clinging to a wall, gravity seemed to not have any effect on him in the slightest. 

With unsettling ease, the joints in his body flexed and adjusted with every jolt from our vehicle navigating the road. His knuckles were bloody and worn from the repeated seams and dents it left in the van. 

“What the fuck is going on out there?” Markov asked as he and Ishkanah watched me from inside.

I didn’t think about my next move, I just grabbed the first thing my hand found and held onto it like a lifeline. The mic stand I gripped was slick with the condensation from the palms of my sweaty, bleeding hands. I trembled at the wind tearing at me through the open door but braved the elements enough to slowly lean outside. 

The van rocked abruptly and nearly threw me out, causing me to instinctively grab onto the door and catch my balance. The thing clinging to the rear noticed my stumble and crawled across the metal towards me. Then, in an attempt to keep him at bay, I swung.

The metallic clang from the mic stand rang out on impact with its body and sent a rattling sensation through my arms. Its grip faltered and it shrieked with pain, but it didn’t let go. He hung there with his boots skidding uselessly against the bumper, scrabbling for purchase. With an outstretched arm, he turned toward me, and his blackened eyes locked onto mine. 

I tried to pull back and get the door shut as quickly as possible, but it lunged anyway. His mouth opened so wide that I could see his serrated teeth. 

As the gap between us closed, the van swerved, causing me to stagger and reflexively throw the mic stand up between us. I closed my eyes and felt an abrupt jolt, followed by a sickly thud and the sound of wheezing.

I opened my eyes to find his face pressed close to mine with the mic stand buried through his chest at an angle I hadn’t anticipated. Blood slid down the metal pole in slow, crimson drops that felt eerily warm against my hands. His breath washed over my face, smelling like rancid meat as it shuddered and gasped for life. All I could think in that moment was that I hadn’t meant to do that, I only wanted to make everything stop.

“DUDE YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Markov exclaimed as Ishkanah looked like she was trying her best to refrain from puking.

“You killed him?” N’gath asked as he turned around to see for himself.

“I’m putting this thing in park.” Valgavoth stated coldly as he gently pressed on the brakes and a few moments later, the van had come to a stop next to the guardrail.

I let go of the mic stand and watched the lifeless body whose blood covered my hands fall to the ground outside. I tossed the bloody, bent mic stand into the snow before N’gath could get a good look at it. For a while, the only sounds that could be heard were our ragged breathing, and the drip… drip… drip of gasoline leaking somewhere beneath us.

After what felt like eons, Ishkanah whispered the question that was on everybody’s minds. ”What do we do now?”

I swallowed the bile that had accumulated in my throat. “I’m not sure.”

“Like I told y’all earlier,” Valgavoth said. “We get rid of the body and pretend that none of this ever happened. Had everyone just listened to me we wouldn’t have ended up in this mess.”

“We can’t just pretend we’re safe here, we need to go back home. It’s too dangerous.” I looked at everyone in hopes that they would side with me.

He shook his head in frustration before slamming his hands down on the steering wheel. “In case you’ve forgotten jackass, we have traveled a long way to go to this place that N’gath INSISTED was the perfect place for recording our album. I’m not going to turn around just because some bozo doped up on ketamine or whatever thought that attacking our van in the middle of the night was peak entertainment.”

“He nearly killed us back there! You and I both know that he…he wasn’t human…  ” I explained before drifting off, afraid to finish my thought.

“Oh don’t tell me that you actually believe that this guy is what you’re trying to imply he is.” Valgavoth scoffed. “If you believe that then you’re a bigger dumbass than I thought.”

“No one here is a dumbass.” N’gath replied.

“Let’s just…move past this and work together as a group.” Ishkanah stated, still gripping to the loose equipment tightly as if any moment they could fall out.

“There is no moving past this, we leave now.” I insisted as I tried to reach for the keys in the ignition.

“You’re right, we leave now, but we’re not turning around.” Valgavoth swatted my hand away before I could touch the keys. “Newsflash, I’m the one behind the wheel so I’m in charge. I didn’t just nearly lose my life going up a mountain from your average meth head hanging around a 7/11 to not record this album. Now you guys can either join me or get the fuck out of this van and y’all can party it up out here in the tundra.”

An uncomfortable quiet overtook the van as everyone sat and pondered the next course of action. Nobody wanted to challenge Valgavoth’s stubborn, headstrong nature, but at the same time, nobody wanted to have this trip mean nothing.

“Look, we did come all this way. Let’s just get rid of the body and get out of here.”

That was the most level-headed and down-to-earth response I had ever heard leave Markov’s mouth. His words earned an approving nod from Valgavoth who turned the keys in the ignition to start the van up.

“Now we’re talking. Let’s make this fast, I want to make it to our destination by sunrise so we can get some proper rest.”

The engine purred unevenly as we stepped out into the cold once more, the snowfall and wind biting through our clothes.

Up close, the body looked monstrous in a way I hadn’t noticed before. I tried not to think about it or so much as make eye contact with the body as we lifted and dragged it toward the rail. My boots slipped on the ice, forcing my breath to come out in a burst of panic.

“It’s okay,” Ishkanah whispered quietly, just barely audible above the crunch of the snow. “You’re okay.”

N’gath and Markov nodded in agreement as Valgavoth kept his focus and grip on the body. Her reassurance helped me steady myself as best as I could to complete the task at hand. None of us spoke a word as we approached a narrow turnout where the guardrail bent inward. The area in that spot dropped away into nothing but darkness, and that’s where we decided to dispose of the body.

Together, as one, we heaved. When we went to let go, the coat from the body nearly got caught on the metal rail causing the fabric to snag against the long-rusted bolts. With a united shove from all of us however, the body tipped, rolled, and vanished over the edge.

I’m not entirely sure how long we stood there, but I know it was longer than we should have. We expected to hear a scream, a thud, or something that confirmed gravity still worked the way it was supposed to. But we never heard anything aside from the vast, engulfing sound of silence and its aftermath.

Eventually Valgavoth muttered and broke the silence. “Let’s get back to the van.”

With that, we all walked back to the van, secured the back doors, and got settled in. Valgavoth pressed his foot down on the gas and we surged ahead into the night. 

A little while later, Ishkanah spoke, her voice barely audible above the whir of the engine. “Is this why the town was abandoned?”

Nobody cut through the stunned silence except for Valgavoth who didn’t even bother looking at her.

“No,” he said immediately. “And don’t say that again.”

That was the last time any of us decided to speak.

I’m writing this as we continue toward the chapel, too anxious to feel how exhausted my body must be feeling right now as I’m pressed against the equipment. No one has spoken since we got back on the road, and I don’t think anyone plans to. 

I keep watching the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following us through the snow, but the road behind us is empty from what I can tell. 

A part of me knows we should turn back, that whatever we threw over that guardrail was an omen, but this trip is everything we’ve worked toward, and no one is willing to be the first to say that fear meant more than our dreams. 

If something else happens, I’ll give an update. If I don’t, then understand that nothing stopped us from turning back.

I’m not really sure if this is the right place to explain my story, but I don’t really know if a right place even exists. I’m not exactly sure what we encountered, but I want others to know about it. Let me explain everything from the beginning.

My band isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination, at least not in the mainstream. We formed in the winter of 2019 in a small, snowy town in Colorado and built up our reputation for years in the Black Metal underground scene. 

Our band quickly achieved notoriety for our haunting music, intense live shows, and intimidating aesthetic that was a byproduct of making raw, unpolished music.

Last year, we recorded the entirety of our first demo, \\\\\\\*Buried in Impenetrable Darkness\\\\\\\*, on a battered to hell tape deck. We borrowed it from our vocalist’s dad and wedged it between old paint cans and a toolbox in the garage we were rehearsing in at the time. 

Every take that we captured and played back made us realize that we had stumbled onto the exact atmosphere we had been striving to achieve since day one. The songs sounded like they had been excavated from a collapsed mineshaft, akin to Darkthrone’s \\\\\\\*Transylvanian Hunger\\\\\\\*. 

It became the kind of demo that was traded heavily, and rumors spread that the music had been recorded deep inside an abandoned crypt. We never corrected people; we just let the myth become a part of the legacy as much as the music.

Before I go any further, I should explain something. We never use our real names in the band. That’s normal in the Black Metal genre. The scene has always been built on personas and the mythos behind them. You don’t join a band like ours to be “Eric” or “Devin” anymore. You take on a name that sounds like it emerged from the foggiest graveyard. Pseudonyms in this genre aren’t just armor, they’re equal parts secrecy, legend, and ritual. 

My bandmates and I chose names that belonged carved into an ossuary wall rather than printed on a driver’s license. That’s how I became Ulalek, and how the rest of the band became N’gath, Ishkanah, Valgavoth, and Lord Markov.

N’gath towered over the rest of us like some giant, starving medieval saint who was all elbows and cheekbones. His arms looked like they belonged on a marionette, and the corpse-paint tattooed on them was self-inflicted with a stick-and-poke rig he had designed himself after listening to nothing but the Norwegian music scene for months. He possessed the seriousness of a monk, but also the theatrics of a guy who could summon malicious spirits. N’gath rarely spoke offstage, but when he did, his voice was surprisingly gentle, like he was determined to make every word of his count.

Then there was Ishkanah, our lead guitarist. She was someone who looked like she had crawled out of a mossy hollow but also maintained perfect eyeliner. The forest-witch vibe wasn’t just for show; she was devoted to that lifestyle. She collected and stored bones as “art projects”, obsessed over botany, and exclusively drank nothing but her herbal teas. Beneath that mystical exterior though, was someone whose nervous system was in constant overdrive. 

Valgavoth, the smartass of the group, was the one who wielded the bass guitar. He was barrel-chested and sported long, raven-black hair that looked freshly conditioned even though he insisted he washed it only in “mountain rain”. His eyes were always hidden behind sunglasses to “avoid the gaze of God”. Whatever the hell that meant. Despite his flaws, he was the glue that held us together. When rehearsals got ugly, he could shut everyone up with one raised eyebrow behind his shades.

Our drummer Lord Markov didn’t just play the drums; he attacked them like they owed him money. Everything about him was loud: his laugh, his personality, his snare hits. He was notorious for throwing his whole body into every story he told, but for all his chaos, Markov was a genuine soul. 

We were a mess, but we were a family, and a perpetually broke one at that. There’s only so much money you can make in music, let alone metal. 

As passionate as we were, it wasn’t paying the bills. Eventually, after slaving away at our day jobs, we managed to save up enough money to fund production for our first album. It seemed like a big break, but our savings were essentially pissed away in an instant when the engineer we hired to oversee our production ghosted us the day before our recording session. 

We were gutted and didn’t have the faintest clue of what to do. The money that we had was gone, the piece of shit took our money and ran. 

When all seemed lost, N’gath found a place he thought we should go record at. He told us when rehearsals had devolved into Markov pounding on the drums in frustration and Ishkanah spiraling about “rhythmic entropy curves”. 

Valgavoth and I were frustrated and wondering where N’gath went when he drifted in from the hallway like a wraith returning from a pilgrimage. He held his phone with both hands, treating it like it were some coveted relic. Valgavoth gave him a questionable look, prompting him to clear his throat.

He didn’t announce what he had to say; instead, he whispered, “I have found… something,”

Markov stopped mid-drumstick twirl and glared. “If this is another one of your “haunted” locations, I’m out,”

“It’s not a “haunted” location, Markov,” N’gath spoke, his voice calm but papery. “It’s a chapel.”

Ishkanah snapped her head up, pupils way too dilated for someone who claimed she’d “only had two coffees.” “A chapel?” she inquired. “Like… with acoustics? Or with spirits? Or with both? Holy architecture has resonance lines, you know. Some frequencies can—”

Valgavoth, still wearing his perpetual indoor sunglasses, put up a hand. “Before Google here goes on another tangent… what’s so special about this chapel of yours? Why should we give a shit about this place?”

N’gath turned the screen around to show a crumbling stone building perched on the edge of a cliff. Snow had swallowed the trees around it, but it was as haunting as it was beautiful. “It’s in the San Juans. The chapel was built in the 1890s and rumor has it that it was meant for monks who live in the mountains there. It has since been abandoned for reasons unknown. Others say they left because they heard and saw… things.”

“Perfect! Let’s go record there and terrorize whatever’s in the mountains along the way! We could get some cool ghost stories out of this.” Markov smiled the kind of smile that meant he was already packing in his head.

“Guys, shouldn’t we think about this? The mountains? That’s a tall ask of us.” I said, trying to talk some sense into my bandmates.

N’gath continued, ignoring Markov and I. “The article said that the acoustics there are flawless and can make harmonies echo for minutes at a time.” He paused, his voice dipping lower. “It would make us sound like we were conjuring something evil and powerful. Our music will finally have teeth.”

Ishkanah shivered with excitement. “Teeth have a frequency you know. You can hear the tension in enamel if the room’s quiet enough.”

“I swear to God, Ish, sometimes I think you’re just making up words.” Valgavoth shot her a side-eye behind the sunglasses before turning back to N’gath. “So, are we taking a field trip there? We’re just going to Magic School Bus our asses and our gear up a mountain and hope we survive the elements? Great plan Einstein. What if the building collapses on us?”

“What if we don’t make it and we’re stranded up there? What then? I want this as badly as you guys, but I don’t think that the potential payoff is worth the risk.” I voiced my concerns, much to the dismay of Valgavoth.

“Sometimes in life, you have to be willing to risk everything. That’s what being in a band is about.”

N’gath put his phone into his pocket and crossed his arms against his chest. “There is nothing to worry about guys. The route to get there is safe, and the chapel is still structurally sound according to my research.”

“Oh, well if an article said it, then clearly it must be true.” Valgavoth spoke dryly.

Markov slammed his sticks together like a declaration of war. “I’m in! If the mountain wants to fight us, let it. A little snow and ice never scared me! Mom didn’t raise no bitch! I’ll drum on its corpse.”

Valgavoth sighed like a disappointed father before replying, “You can’t drum on a mountain’s corpse you dumbass,”

Markov shot a dirty look at Valgavoth as he twirled his drumsticks idly. 

Ishkanah bounced on her toes in a jittery kinetic blur. “We should test the acoustics with dissonant triads! Or drop-tuned tremolo lines! Or—”

“Lovely,” Valgavoth interrupted. “We’ll die and it’ll be because we annoyed the shit out of a spirit with jazz chords.”

“This could be the breakthrough,” N’gath exhaled slowly. 

“N’gath could be right.” I spoke after sitting on the idea for a moment. “This could be our breakthrough moment. We could finally capture that sound we’ve been looking for at this place.”

For a few seconds after I said that, the room went dead silent. Nobody said anything as everyone thought the situation over in their heads. None of us wanted to admit that we were desperate, but we were. Months of hard work were wasted, and our dreams were hanging on to the hopes that we were impulsive enough to make them a reality.

Seeing everyone so passionate and alive made me have a change of heart about my concerns. Looking at everyone’s faces, I could tell the others felt the same, strange mix of dread and excitement when you’re about to do something profoundly stupid but possibly life-changing. 

N’gath just stood there, hands folded in his sleeves like some gaunt prophet as we all nodded one by one. With no second thoughts, the five of us agreed to drive straight into the mountains with nothing but our gear, worse judgment, and corpse paint.

We packed everything we needed shortly afterward and began taking everything to the shitty white van we owned. As we loaded up the last of the equipment into the van, Valgavoth slid his sunglasses down his nose, and said, “If this thing breaks down on a mountain road and we get eaten by whatever cryptid is trending this month, I’m blaming all of you.”

N’gath didn’t say anything at first. He just placed his microphone gently on top of one of Ishkanah’s amps, like he was tucking a child into bed. Then, softly:

“The spirits of the mountain will guide us.”

“Are the spirits a more reliable guide than Mapquest, N’gath?” Valgavoth rolled his eyes and climbed into the passenger seat.

Ishkanah buckled herself in, eyes wide and bright like she hadn’t slept in three days. “Actually, mountains have specific harmonic signatures—”

“NOPE,” Markov shouted from the back before she could get started. “Not listening to your ramblings again. Last time, I lost a whole weekend.”

N’gath climbed into the driver’s seat as I sat next to Ishkanah, laughing at Markov’s gripes with her. I had barely fastened my seatbelt before the van growled to life, and we rumbled out of the city. 

The van shuddered as it drove down the road, as snow gathered on the edges of the highway in jagged, messy piles. Somewhere between the mile markers, I watched the sky turn a bruise-purple and listened to the engine screech like a dying animal. 

Ishkanah just stared out the window, her voice was unsettlingly calm as she spoke to no one in particular. “They left because they heard and saw things…what was meant by that exactly?”

Valgavoth slowly shook his head in awkward disapproval. “Ish, why are you like this? Haven’t you ever heard of folklore or superstitions?”

“From what I read, the town was evacuated and left abandoned due to a monster.” N’gath whispered, almost to himself. Before I could speak up, I noticed a recognizable golden arch. 

“Pull into that McDonald’s N’gath. I want a goddamn McRib.” Valgavoth pointed at the McDonald’s sign like it was salvation, only for us to discover the building was completely dark. There was not a single soul in the parking lot and the drive-thru menu hung half off its metal frame. 

He cursed under his breath for a full minute before muttering that the universe was “a tasteless bitch.” We all laughed hysterically at his bitterness, our laughter thinning out as we ascended higher into the mountains. 

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, but I remember waking to the sound of \\\\\\\*Beyond the Great Vast Forest\\\\\\\* by Emperor dissolving into static as our radio lost its signal. I looked out the passenger window to see that the roadside houses I’d been watching earlier had disappeared entirely into the darkness. 

Beyond the narrow cone of light from our dim headlights was but pitch-black pressing in. Snow whipped sideways, causing the asphalt from the road to be swallowed in places that erased the center line of the road entirely. The van hummed unevenly beneath us as the engine strained against the incline, causing the enclosed space to vibrate loudly. 

Valgavoth muttered something about the radio being garbage under his breath and reached for the dial to fix the signal. 

For a while, the only sounds were the engine’s labored whine and the rhythmic slap of snow against the windows. Every sweep of the windshield wipers smeared the world back into white noise. 

There were no signs of life other than the occasional reflective marker flashing and vanishing at the edge of the beams of our headlights. I found myself counting the seconds as I looked out the window, staring out at nothing. 

Suddenly, a heavy thud detonated against the passenger side. The metal of the vehicle boomed and I was driven hard into the door due to the impact, causing the breath to be punched clean out of my lungs. White sparks burst across my vision as N’gath fought the wheel. The van swerved violently across the narrow road toward the snow-choked shoulder before N’gath was able to stabilize the vehicle and snap us back onto the road.

Markov sat up in his seat having been woken up by the impact of whatever we had collided with. “What the hell was that?”

Before anyone could answer, an agonizingly slow, metallic scrape noise pierced the air. 

I turned my head to look outside my window, just in time to see a shape dart across the outside of our vehicle. I didn’t get a clear look, but before I could let anyone know about what I had seen, Ishkanah screamed. 

The roof dented inward and snow slid down the windshield in sheets from the weight pressing down above us.

“There’s someone on the van!” I cried out as another violent jolt rocked us forward.

“Hold on everyone!” N’gath declared through clenched teeth as he jerked the wheel hard to the left, causing us to fishtail. The tires screamed against the ice, the sudden force ripping the shape free from above. 

A sickening thud echoed through the still, night air as the body disappeared into the snowbank and the van came to a screeching halt several yards down the road. N’gath cut the engine and we sat in complete silence for what felt like an eternity trying to process what had just happened. 

Markov was the first to speak, his words being the ones to articulate what everyone else was afraid to speak into existence.

“I think…I think that was a guy.”

My stomach plummeted at the realization. We sat there in the freezing cold of the darkness, our breath fogging the windows as we listened for movement outside.

“We can’t just leave him,” Ishkanah pleaded in a whisper. “If we…if we killed someone—”

“WE…didn’t kill anybody. Got that?” Valgavoth turned in his seat to address us. “We’re going to pretend this didn’t happen and we’re going to drive away from here.”

“Are you fucking mental? We just hit a person and you want us to leave the scene of a crime?!” I cried out in anger as I reached for my door handle.

“We’re in the middle of fucking nowhere in the mountains Sherlock. Who is going to know? Besides, we were attacked first. We could just say it was in self-defense. The bastard was practically asking for this anyways.” 

Against my better judgment, I opened the door and felt the cold sting my face.

“Where are you going?” Markov asked as I unbuckled myself and stepped foot onto the snow-covered road outside.

“To do the right thing.”

No one moved at first. The only sound in the deafening quiet was the snow that continued to fall in thick sheets around the van. I half expected someone to argue or to tell me it was a bad idea, but guilt has a way of settling things faster than logic ever could. One by one, the hinges of the doors squeaked open, and seconds later, the sound of boots crunching in the snow could be heard following me. 

The darkness engulfed everything but the weak, yellow glow of our headlights as we made our way through the snow and into the treeline. My heart pounded harder with every step as the skid marks and churned powder morphed into dark smears until we approached the limp body at the end of the trail. 

“Jesus,” Markov whispered, his breath lingered in the air in a pale, trembling mist. “We killed him.”

I took another step closer, my boots crunching softly against the frozen terrain. Up close, something was off in a way I couldn’t articulate at the time. His clothes consisted of an old-fashioned dark coat and boots with no tread that were buried beneath the snow. The man’s chest didn’t rise, but I thought I saw the fingers of the arm twisted beneath him twitch.

“Guys, I think I saw movement.” I stated aloud as I approached and felt the ice-cold temperature of his hand against mine.

“We need to get him to a hospital!” Ishkanah declared as she crouched beside me to inspect the body.

Valgavoth rolled his eyes in annoyance. “We’re not taking him anywhere. He’s dead. End of story. Now let’s get back into the van before we freeze to death out here.” 

Before we could even acknowledge Valgavoth’s comment, the man’s eyes shot open. His pitch-black pupils reflected the van’s headlights before locking onto me. 

I didn’t have time to react. 

One moment he was in a crumbled heap in the snow, and the next he was airborne with the sudden and complete awareness of a predator.

The man tackled me and sent me sprawling backward hard enough to drive the air from my lungs in a panicked gasp. I screamed in terror as the man’s hands clamped down on both of my shoulders. His mouth ripped and tore at my hands as I raised them defensively on instinct. 

The demented and choked growling sound the man made didn’t sound like anything I had ever heard. It sounded ancient, primal, and most terrifying of all, hungry. His teeth scraped against the flesh of my hands, causing light drops of blood to fall onto my clothes. 

Ishkanah lunged forward instinctively, her fingers closing around my arm to pull me away, but the man reacted without turning to her. He struck her with one arm; the force sent her tumbling into the snow several feet away. She hit the ground hard, and her body let out a weak groan as she struggled to sit up.

“RUN!” Valgavoth shouted, his voice cracking as he rushed towards Ishkanah to drag her to safety while N’gath and Markov came to my aid.

Markov grabbed a nearby rock and launched it at the man’s head to seemingly no effect. N’gath found a decently sized tree branch on the ground and started whacking the man over the head with it in an effort to get him off of me.

After several sick thuds to the skull, the man lifted his head slowly. It was in that moment that we noticed that he wasn’t a man at all. He was something else entirely.

His mouth was dripping wet with saliva as he flashed his teeth and turned toward N’gath and Markov. I knew I had a small window of opportunity in that moment, so I took advantage of the distraction and pushed the man off me. 

I began running back to the van with the others, turning back once to see the frenzied gaze in the man’s eyes as we sprinted. The bitter cold tore at my legs and my lungs felt like they were on fire as we got closer to the van. 

Behind us, we heard a shrill scream echo as the man continued his pursuit. The headlights in the distance signaled safety as Valgavoth and Ishkanah were the first to reach the van.

Valgavoth helped Ishkanah get inside and yanked the driver’s side door open just as the rest of us were able to pile inside in a blind panic. Not even a moment later, the man slammed into the side of the vehicle, causing the entire van to shake. The metal groaned from the impact, the van nearly tipping over on its side.

“GO!” Markov yelled with urgency as Valgavoth turned to N’gath.

“GIMME THE FUCKING KEYS!!!” 

N’gath frantically searched his pockets and tossed them to Valgavoth. Outside, there was another screech and another thud that made the van slide a few feet across the road. Valgavoth turned the keys in the ignition, and floored it out of there.

The van jerked forward violently as we took off, but we were not alone. The man clung to the rear door and punched through the steel with his long, pale fingers. Under the immense pressure and strength of our attacker, the doors buckled and the metal began being ripped apart like paper.

“If he tears the doors open, we’re going to lose our equipment!” Markov shouted as he looked to Valgavoth for ideas.

Valgavoth never took his eyes off the road. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting from me, I’m the one driving!”

That’s when N’gath chimed in. “Ulalek, unlock the door and see if you can knock him off somehow.”

“Have you lost your goddamn mind?!” I protested. “How do you expect me to get this dude off our van?”

“FIGURE IT OUT!” Valgavoth jerked the wheel again, harder this time. The van’s tires screeched as we narrowly avoided contact with the guardrail. Whoever, or rather, whatever was clinging to the back barely reacted. A hand punched near the door handle, causing its fingers to curl inward.

Markov let out a laugh that was halfway between hysteria and shock. “Yeah, easy for you to say that while we’re being peeled open like a fucking can of Campbell’s.”

“STOP ARGUING,” Ishkanah snapped from her seat, where she was bracing herself against an amp.

I stared at the side door handle, as my heart pounded so hard it started to blur my vision. The metal surrounding the rear doors bowed inward again, and snow blasted through the holes in harsh, stinging bursts.

N’gath didn’t raise his voice, but instead remained calm as ever somehow. “You do not need to fight it, you only need to distract it.”

The van hit a bump and I slammed shoulder-first into the side of the vehicle. From outside, we could hear an excited scream echo as one of its hands disappeared through the door entirely. It dragged its fingers blindly along the interior metal as Valgavoth glanced in the rearview mirror at the sheer carnage unfolding.

“We’re running out of van!” He yelled before turning his attention back to the road, hands firmly planted on the steering wheel.

“No shit man!” I heard Markov scream as I unlocked the side door before I could second guess my decision. The moment the latch clicked, the door rattled violently and caved inward slightly. I hastily slid the door open, and in a blinding white rush, the icy wind bombarded the interior. 

I shuddered as I gripped the door, watching the road pass by in a blur below. I looked to my left and right, and it was on the right-hand side of the van that I could make out the man clinging sideways to the rear. Like a Spider clinging to a wall, gravity seemed to not have any effect on him in the slightest. 

With unsettling ease, the joints in his body flexed and adjusted with every jolt from our vehicle navigating the road. His knuckles were bloody and worn from the repeated seams and dents it left in the van. 

“What the fuck is going on out there?” Markov asked as he and Ishkanah watched me from inside.

I didn’t think about my next move, I just grabbed the first thing my hand found and held onto it like a lifeline. The mic stand I gripped was slick with the condensation from the palms of my sweaty, bleeding hands. I trembled at the wind tearing at me through the open door but braved the elements enough to slowly lean outside. 

The van rocked abruptly and nearly threw me out, causing me to instinctively grab onto the door and catch my balance. The thing clinging to the rear noticed my stumble and crawled across the metal towards me. Then, in an attempt to keep him at bay, I swung.

The metallic clang from the mic stand rang out on impact with its body and sent a rattling sensation through my arms. Its grip faltered and it shrieked with pain, but it didn’t let go. He hung there with his boots skidding uselessly against the bumper, scrabbling for purchase. With an outstretched arm, he turned toward me, and his blackened eyes locked onto mine. 

I tried to pull back and get the door shut as quickly as possible, but it lunged anyway. His mouth opened so wide that I could see his serrated teeth. 

As the gap between us closed, the van swerved, causing me to stagger and reflexively throw the mic stand up between us. I closed my eyes and felt an abrupt jolt, followed by a sickly thud and the sound of wheezing.

I opened my eyes to find his face pressed close to mine with the mic stand buried through his chest at an angle I hadn’t anticipated. Blood slid down the metal pole in slow, crimson drops that felt eerily warm against my hands. His breath washed over my face, smelling like rancid meat as it shuddered and gasped for life. All I could think in that moment was that I hadn’t meant to do that, I only wanted to make everything stop.

“DUDE YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Markov exclaimed as Ishkanah looked like she was trying her best to refrain from puking.

“You killed him?” N’gath asked as he turned around to see for himself.

“I’m putting this thing in park.” Valgavoth stated coldly as he gently pressed on the brakes and a few moments later, the van had come to a stop next to the guardrail.

I let go of the mic stand and watched the lifeless body whose blood covered my hands fall to the ground outside. I tossed the bloody, bent mic stand into the snow before N’gath could get a good look at it. For a while, the only sounds that could be heard were our ragged breathing, and the drip… drip… drip of gasoline leaking somewhere beneath us.

After what felt like eons, Ishkanah whispered the question that was on everybody’s minds. ”What do we do now?”

I swallowed the bile that had accumulated in my throat. “I’m not sure.”

“Like I told y’all earlier,” Valgavoth said. “We get rid of the body and pretend that none of this ever happened. Had everyone just listened to me we wouldn’t have ended up in this mess.”

“We can’t just pretend we’re safe here, we need to go back home. It’s too dangerous.” I looked at everyone in hopes that they would side with me.

He shook his head in frustration before slamming his hands down on the steering wheel. “In case you’ve forgotten jackass, we have traveled a long way to go to this place that N’gath INSISTED was the perfect place for recording our album. I’m not going to turn around just because some bozo doped up on ketamine or whatever thought that attacking our van in the middle of the night was peak entertainment.”

“He nearly killed us back there! You and I both know that he…he wasn’t human…  ” I explained before drifting off, afraid to finish my thought.

“Oh don’t tell me that you actually believe that this guy is what you’re trying to imply he is.” Valgavoth scoffed. “If you believe that then you’re a bigger dumbass than I thought.”

“No one here is a dumbass.” N’gath replied.

“Let’s just…move past this and work together as a group.” Ishkanah stated, still gripping to the loose equipment tightly as if any moment they could fall out.

“There is no moving past this, we leave now.” I insisted as I tried to reach for the keys in the ignition.

“You’re right, we leave now, but we’re not turning around.” Valgavoth swatted my hand away before I could touch the keys. “Newsflash, I’m the one behind the wheel so I’m in charge. I didn’t just nearly lose my life going up a mountain from your average meth head hanging around a 7/11 to not record this album. Now you guys can either join me or get the fuck out of this van and y’all can party it up out here in the tundra.”

An uncomfortable quiet overtook the van as everyone sat and pondered the next course of action. Nobody wanted to challenge Valgavoth’s stubborn, headstrong nature, but at the same time, nobody wanted to have this trip mean nothing.

“Look, we did come all this way. Let’s just get rid of the body and get out of here.”

That was the most level-headed and down-to-earth response I had ever heard leave Markov’s mouth. His words earned an approving nod from Valgavoth who turned the keys in the ignition to start the van up.

“Now we’re talking. Let’s make this fast, I want to make it to our destination by sunrise so we can get some proper rest.”

The engine purred unevenly as we stepped out into the cold once more, the snowfall and wind biting through our clothes.

Up close, the body looked monstrous in a way I hadn’t noticed before. I tried not to think about it or so much as make eye contact with the body as we lifted and dragged it toward the rail. My boots slipped on the ice, forcing my breath to come out in a burst of panic.

“It’s okay,” Ishkanah whispered quietly, just barely audible above the crunch of the snow. “You’re okay.”

N’gath and Markov nodded in agreement as Valgavoth kept his focus and grip on the body. Her reassurance helped me steady myself as best as I could to complete the task at hand. None of us spoke a word as we approached a narrow turnout where the guardrail bent inward. The area in that spot dropped away into nothing but darkness, and that’s where we decided to dispose of the body.

Together, as one, we heaved. When we went to let go, the coat from the body nearly got caught on the metal rail causing the fabric to snag against the long-rusted bolts. With a united shove from all of us however, the body tipped, rolled, and vanished over the edge.

I’m not entirely sure how long we stood there, but I know it was longer than we should have. We expected to hear a scream, a thud, or something that confirmed gravity still worked the way it was supposed to. But we never heard anything aside from the vast, engulfing sound of silence and its aftermath.

Eventually Valgavoth muttered and broke the silence. “Let’s get back to the van.”

With that, we all walked back to the van, secured the back doors, and got settled in. Valgavoth pressed his foot down on the gas and we surged ahead into the night. 

A little while later, Ishkanah spoke, her voice barely audible above the whir of the engine. “Is this why the town was abandoned?”

Nobody cut through the stunned silence except for Valgavoth who didn’t even bother looking at her.

“No,” he said immediately. “And don’t say that again.”

That was the last time any of us decided to speak.

I’m writing this as we continue toward the chapel, too anxious to feel how exhausted my body must be feeling right now as I’m pressed against the equipment. No one has spoken since we got back on the road, and I don’t think anyone plans to. 

I keep watching the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following us through the snow, but the road behind us is empty from what I can tell. 

A part of me knows we should turn back, that whatever we threw over that guardrail was an omen, but this trip is everything we’ve worked toward, and no one is willing to be the first to say that fear meant more than our dreams. 

If something else happens, I’ll give an update. If I don’t, then understand that nothing stopped us from turning back.

I’m not really sure if this is the right place to explain my story, but I don’t really know if a right place even exists. I’m not exactly sure what we encountered, but I want others to know about it. Let me explain everything from the beginning.

My band isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination, at least not in the mainstream. We formed in the winter of 2019 in a small, snowy town in Colorado and built up our reputation for years in the Black Metal underground scene. 

Our band quickly achieved notoriety for our haunting music, intense live shows, and intimidating aesthetic that was a byproduct of making raw, unpolished music.

Last year, we recorded the entirety of our first demo, \\\*Buried in Impenetrable Darkness\\\*, on a battered to hell tape deck. We borrowed it from our vocalist’s dad and wedged it between old paint cans and a toolbox in the garage we were rehearsing in at the time. 

Every take that we captured and played back made us realize that we had stumbled onto the exact atmosphere we had been striving to achieve since day one. The songs sounded like they had been excavated from a collapsed mineshaft, akin to Darkthrone’s \\\*Transylvanian Hunger\\\*. 

It became the kind of demo that was traded heavily, and rumors spread that the music had been recorded deep inside an abandoned crypt. We never corrected people; we just let the myth become a part of the legacy as much as the music.

Before I go any further, I should explain something. We never use our real names in the band. That’s normal in the Black Metal genre. The scene has always been built on personas and the mythos behind them. You don’t join a band like ours to be “Eric” or “Devin” anymore. You take on a name that sounds like it emerged from the foggiest graveyard. Pseudonyms in this genre aren’t just armor, they’re equal parts secrecy, legend, and ritual. 

My bandmates and I chose names that belonged carved into an ossuary wall rather than printed on a driver’s license. That’s how I became Ulalek, and how the rest of the band became N’gath, Ishkanah, Valgavoth, and Lord Markov.

N’gath towered over the rest of us like some giant, starving medieval saint who was all elbows and cheekbones. His arms looked like they belonged on a marionette, and the corpse-paint tattooed on them was self-inflicted with a stick-and-poke rig he had designed himself after listening to nothing but the Norwegian music scene for months. He possessed the seriousness of a monk, but also the theatrics of a guy who could summon malicious spirits. N’gath rarely spoke offstage, but when he did, his voice was surprisingly gentle, like he was determined to make every word of his count.

Then there was Ishkanah, our lead guitarist. She was someone who looked like she had crawled out of a mossy hollow but also maintained perfect eyeliner. The forest-witch vibe wasn’t just for show; she was devoted to that lifestyle. She collected and stored bones as “art projects”, obsessed over botany, and exclusively drank nothing but her herbal teas. Beneath that mystical exterior though, was someone whose nervous system was in constant overdrive. 

Valgavoth, the smartass of the group, was the one who wielded the bass guitar. He was barrel-chested and sported long, raven-black hair that looked freshly conditioned even though he insisted he washed it only in “mountain rain”. His eyes were always hidden behind sunglasses to “avoid the gaze of God”. Whatever the hell that meant. Despite his flaws, he was the glue that held us together. When rehearsals got ugly, he could shut everyone up with one raised eyebrow behind his shades.

Our drummer Lord Markov didn’t just play the drums; he attacked them like they owed him money. Everything about him was loud: his laugh, his personality, his snare hits. He was notorious for throwing his whole body into every story he told, but for all his chaos, Markov was a genuine soul. 

We were a mess, but we were a family, and a perpetually broke one at that. There’s only so much money you can make in music, let alone metal. 

As passionate as we were, it wasn’t paying the bills. Eventually, after slaving away at our day jobs, we managed to save up enough money to fund production for our first album. It seemed like a big break, but our savings were essentially pissed away in an instant when the engineer we hired to oversee our production ghosted us the day before our recording session. 

We were gutted and didn’t have the faintest clue of what to do. The money that we had was gone, the piece of shit took our money and ran. 

When all seemed lost, N’gath found a place he thought we should go record at. He told us when rehearsals had devolved into Markov pounding on the drums in frustration and Ishkanah spiraling about “rhythmic entropy curves”. 

Valgavoth and I were frustrated and wondering where N’gath went when he drifted in from the hallway like a wraith returning from a pilgrimage. He held his phone with both hands, treating it like it were some coveted relic. Valgavoth gave him a questionable look, prompting him to clear his throat.

He didn’t announce what he had to say; instead, he whispered, “I have found… something,”

Markov stopped mid-drumstick twirl and glared. “If this is another one of your “haunted” locations, I’m out,”

“It’s not a “haunted” location, Markov,” N’gath spoke, his voice calm but papery. “It’s a chapel.”

Ishkanah snapped her head up, pupils way too dilated for someone who claimed she’d “only had two coffees.” “A chapel?” she inquired. “Like… with acoustics? Or with spirits? Or with both? Holy architecture has resonance lines, you know. Some frequencies can—”

Valgavoth, still wearing his perpetual indoor sunglasses, put up a hand. “Before Google here goes on another tangent… what’s so special about this chapel of yours? Why should we give a shit about this place?”

N’gath turned the screen around to show a crumbling stone building perched on the edge of a cliff. Snow had swallowed the trees around it, but it was as haunting as it was beautiful. “It’s in the San Juans. The chapel was built in the 1890s and rumor has it that it was meant for monks who live in the mountains there. It has since been abandoned for reasons unknown. Others say they left because they heard and saw… things.”

“Perfect! Let’s go record there and terrorize whatever’s in the mountains along the way! We could get some cool ghost stories out of this.” Markov smiled the kind of smile that meant he was already packing in his head.

“Guys, shouldn’t we think about this? The mountains? That’s a tall ask of us.” I said, trying to talk some sense into my bandmates.

N’gath continued, ignoring Markov and I. “The article said that the acoustics there are flawless and can make harmonies echo for minutes at a time.” He paused, his voice dipping lower. “It would make us sound like we were conjuring something evil and powerful. Our music will finally have teeth.”

Ishkanah shivered with excitement. “Teeth have a frequency you know. You can hear the tension in enamel if the room’s quiet enough.”

“I swear to God, Ish, sometimes I think you’re just making up words.” Valgavoth shot her a side-eye behind the sunglasses before turning back to N’gath. “So, are we taking a field trip there? We’re just going to Magic School Bus our asses and our gear up a mountain and hope we survive the elements? Great plan Einstein. What if the building collapses on us?”

“What if we don’t make it and we’re stranded up there? What then? I want this as badly as you guys, but I don’t think that the potential payoff is worth the risk.” I voiced my concerns, much to the dismay of Valgavoth.

“Sometimes in life, you have to be willing to risk everything. That’s what being in a band is about.”

N’gath put his phone into his pocket and crossed his arms against his chest. “There is nothing to worry about guys. The route to get there is safe, and the chapel is still structurally sound according to my research.”

“Oh, well if an article said it, then clearly it must be true.” Valgavoth spoke dryly.

Markov slammed his sticks together like a declaration of war. “I’m in! If the mountain wants to fight us, let it. A little snow and ice never scared me! Mom didn’t raise no bitch! I’ll drum on its corpse.”

Valgavoth sighed like a disappointed father before replying, “You can’t drum on a mountain’s corpse you dumbass,”

Markov shot a dirty look at Valgavoth as he twirled his drumsticks idly. 

Ishkanah bounced on her toes in a jittery kinetic blur. “We should test the acoustics with dissonant triads! Or drop-tuned tremolo lines! Or—”

“Lovely,” Valgavoth interrupted. “We’ll die and it’ll be because we annoyed the shit out of a spirit with jazz chords.”

“This could be the breakthrough,” N’gath exhaled slowly. 

“N’gath could be right.” I spoke after sitting on the idea for a moment. “This could be our breakthrough moment. We could finally capture that sound we’ve been looking for at this place.”

For a few seconds after I said that, the room went dead silent. Nobody said anything as everyone thought the situation over in their heads. None of us wanted to admit that we were desperate, but we were. Months of hard work were wasted, and our dreams were hanging on to the hopes that we were impulsive enough to make them a reality.

Seeing everyone so passionate and alive made me have a change of heart about my concerns. Looking at everyone’s faces, I could tell the others felt the same, strange mix of dread and excitement when you’re about to do something profoundly stupid but possibly life-changing. 

N’gath just stood there, hands folded in his sleeves like some gaunt prophet as we all nodded one by one. With no second thoughts, the five of us agreed to drive straight into the mountains with nothing but our gear, worse judgment, and corpse paint.

We packed everything we needed shortly afterward and began taking everything to the shitty white van we owned. As we loaded up the last of the equipment into the van, Valgavoth slid his sunglasses down his nose, and said, “If this thing breaks down on a mountain road and we get eaten by whatever cryptid is trending this month, I’m blaming all of you.”

N’gath didn’t say anything at first. He just placed his microphone gently on top of one of Ishkanah’s amps, like he was tucking a child into bed. Then, softly:

“The spirits of the mountain will guide us.”

“Are the spirits a more reliable guide than Mapquest, N’gath?” Valgavoth rolled his eyes and climbed into the passenger seat.

Ishkanah buckled herself in, eyes wide and bright like she hadn’t slept in three days. “Actually, mountains have specific harmonic signatures—”

“NOPE,” Markov shouted from the back before she could get started. “Not listening to your ramblings again. Last time, I lost a whole weekend.”

N’gath climbed into the driver’s seat as I sat next to Ishkanah, laughing at Markov’s gripes with her. I had barely fastened my seatbelt before the van growled to life, and we rumbled out of the city. 

The van shuddered as it drove down the road, as snow gathered on the edges of the highway in jagged, messy piles. Somewhere between the mile markers, I watched the sky turn a bruise-purple and listened to the engine screech like a dying animal. 

Ishkanah just stared out the window, her voice was unsettlingly calm as she spoke to no one in particular. “They left because they heard and saw things…what was meant by that exactly?”

Valgavoth slowly shook his head in awkward disapproval. “Ish, why are you like this? Haven’t you ever heard of folklore or superstitions?”

“From what I read, the town was evacuated and left abandoned due to a monster.” N’gath whispered, almost to himself. Before I could speak up, I noticed a recognizable golden arch. 

“Pull into that McDonald’s N’gath. I want a goddamn McRib.” Valgavoth pointed at the McDonald’s sign like it was salvation, only for us to discover the building was completely dark. There was not a single soul in the parking lot and the drive-thru menu hung half off its metal frame. 

He cursed under his breath for a full minute before muttering that the universe was “a tasteless bitch.” We all laughed hysterically at his bitterness, our laughter thinning out as we ascended higher into the mountains. 

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, but I remember waking to the sound of \\\*Beyond the Great Vast Forest\\\* by Emperor dissolving into static as our radio lost its signal. I looked out the passenger window to see that the roadside houses I’d been watching earlier had disappeared entirely into the darkness. 

Beyond the narrow cone of light from our dim headlights was but pitch-black pressing in. Snow whipped sideways, causing the asphalt from the road to be swallowed in places that erased the center line of the road entirely. The van hummed unevenly beneath us as the engine strained against the incline, causing the enclosed space to vibrate loudly. 

Valgavoth muttered something about the radio being garbage under his breath and reached for the dial to fix the signal. 

For a while, the only sounds were the engine’s labored whine and the rhythmic slap of snow against the windows. Every sweep of the windshield wipers smeared the world back into white noise. 

There were no signs of life other than the occasional reflective marker flashing and vanishing at the edge of the beams of our headlights. I found myself counting the seconds as I looked out the window, staring out at nothing. 

Suddenly, a heavy thud detonated against the passenger side. The metal of the vehicle boomed and I was driven hard into the door due to the impact, causing the breath to be punched clean out of my lungs. White sparks burst across my vision as N’gath fought the wheel. The van swerved violently across the narrow road toward the snow-choked shoulder before N’gath was able to stabilize the vehicle and snap us back onto the road.

Markov sat up in his seat having been woken up by the impact of whatever we had collided with. “What the hell was that?”

Before anyone could answer, an agonizingly slow, metallic scrape noise pierced the air. 

I turned my head to look outside my window, just in time to see a shape dart across the outside of our vehicle. I didn’t get a clear look, but before I could let anyone know about what I had seen, Ishkanah screamed. 

The roof dented inward and snow slid down the windshield in sheets from the weight pressing down above us.

“There’s someone on the van!” I cried out as another violent jolt rocked us forward.

“Hold on everyone!” N’gath declared through clenched teeth as he jerked the wheel hard to the left, causing us to fishtail. The tires screamed against the ice, the sudden force ripping the shape free from above. 

A sickening thud echoed through the still, night air as the body disappeared into the snowbank and the van came to a screeching halt several yards down the road. N’gath cut the engine and we sat in complete silence for what felt like an eternity trying to process what had just happened. 

Markov was the first to speak, his words being the ones to articulate what everyone else was afraid to speak into existence.

“I think…I think that was a guy.”

My stomach plummeted at the realization. We sat there in the freezing cold of the darkness, our breath fogging the windows as we listened for movement outside.

“We can’t just leave him,” Ishkanah pleaded in a whisper. “If we…if we killed someone—”

“WE…didn’t kill anybody. Got that?” Valgavoth turned in his seat to address us. “We’re going to pretend this didn’t happen and we’re going to drive away from here.”

“Are you fucking mental? We just hit a person and you want us to leave the scene of a crime?!” I cried out in anger as I reached for my door handle.

“We’re in the middle of fucking nowhere in the mountains Sherlock. Who is going to know? Besides, we were attacked first. We could just say it was in self-defense. The bastard was practically asking for this anyways.” 

Against my better judgment, I opened the door and felt the cold sting my face.

“Where are you going?” Markov asked as I unbuckled myself and stepped foot onto the snow-covered road outside.

“To do the right thing.”

No one moved at first. The only sound in the deafening quiet was the snow that continued to fall in thick sheets around the van. I half expected someone to argue or to tell me it was a bad idea, but guilt has a way of settling things faster than logic ever could. One by one, the hinges of the doors squeaked open, and seconds later, the sound of boots crunching in the snow could be heard following me. 

The darkness engulfed everything but the weak, yellow glow of our headlights as we made our way through the snow and into the treeline. My heart pounded harder with every step as the skid marks and churned powder morphed into dark smears until we approached the limp body at the end of the trail. 

“Jesus,” Markov whispered, his breath lingered in the air in a pale, trembling mist. “We killed him.”

I took another step closer, my boots crunching softly against the frozen terrain. Up close, something was off in a way I couldn’t articulate at the time. His clothes consisted of an old-fashioned dark coat and boots with no tread that were buried beneath the snow. The man’s chest didn’t rise, but I thought I saw the fingers of the arm twisted beneath him twitch.

“Guys, I think I saw movement.” I stated aloud as I approached and felt the ice-cold temperature of his hand against mine.

“We need to get him to a hospital!” Ishkanah declared as she crouched beside me to inspect the body.

Valgavoth rolled his eyes in annoyance. “We’re not taking him anywhere. He’s dead. End of story. Now let’s get back into the van before we freeze to death out here.” 

Before we could even acknowledge Valgavoth’s comment, the man’s eyes shot open. His pitch-black pupils reflected the van’s headlights before locking onto me. 

I didn’t have time to react. 

One moment he was in a crumbled heap in the snow, and the next he was airborne with the sudden and complete awareness of a predator.

The man tackled me and sent me sprawling backward hard enough to drive the air from my lungs in a panicked gasp. I screamed in terror as the man’s hands clamped down on both of my shoulders. His mouth ripped and tore at my hands as I raised them defensively on instinct. 

The demented and choked growling sound the man made didn’t sound like anything I had ever heard. It sounded ancient, primal, and most terrifying of all, hungry. His teeth scraped against the flesh of my hands, causing light drops of blood to fall onto my clothes. 

Ishkanah lunged forward instinctively, her fingers closing around my arm to pull me away, but the man reacted without turning to her. He struck her with one arm; the force sent her tumbling into the snow several feet away. She hit the ground hard, and her body let out a weak groan as she struggled to sit up.

“RUN!” Valgavoth shouted, his voice cracking as he rushed towards Ishkanah to drag her to safety while N’gath and Markov came to my aid.

Markov grabbed a nearby rock and launched it at the man’s head to seemingly no effect. N’gath found a decently sized tree branch on the ground and started whacking the man over the head with it in an effort to get him off of me.

After several sick thuds to the skull, the man lifted his head slowly. It was in that moment that we noticed that he wasn’t a man at all. He was something else entirely.

His mouth was dripping wet with saliva as he flashed his teeth and turned toward N’gath and Markov. I knew I had a small window of opportunity in that moment, so I took advantage of the distraction and pushed the man off me. 

I began running back to the van with the others, turning back once to see the frenzied gaze in the man’s eyes as we sprinted. The bitter cold tore at my legs and my lungs felt like they were on fire as we got closer to the van. 

Behind us, we heard a shrill scream echo as the man continued his pursuit. The headlights in the distance signaled safety as Valgavoth and Ishkanah were the first to reach the van.

Valgavoth helped Ishkanah get inside and yanked the driver’s side door open just as the rest of us were able to pile inside in a blind panic. Not even a moment later, the man slammed into the side of the vehicle, causing the entire van to shake. The metal groaned from the impact, the van nearly tipping over on its side.

“GO!” Markov yelled with urgency as Valgavoth turned to N’gath.

“GIMME THE FUCKING KEYS!!!” 

N’gath frantically searched his pockets and tossed them to Valgavoth. Outside, there was another screech and another thud that made the van slide a few feet across the road. Valgavoth turned the keys in the ignition, and floored it out of there.

The van jerked forward violently as we took off, but we were not alone. The man clung to the rear door and punched through the steel with his long, pale fingers. Under the immense pressure and strength of our attacker, the doors buckled and the metal began being ripped apart like paper.

“If he tears the doors open, we’re going to lose our equipment!” Markov shouted as he looked to Valgavoth for ideas.

Valgavoth never took his eyes off the road. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting from me, I’m the one driving!”

That’s when N’gath chimed in. “Ulalek, unlock the door and see if you can knock him off somehow.”

“Have you lost your goddamn mind?!” I protested. “How do you expect me to get this dude off our van?”

“FIGURE IT OUT!” Valgavoth jerked the wheel again, harder this time. The van’s tires screeched as we narrowly avoided contact with the guardrail. Whoever, or rather, whatever was clinging to the back barely reacted. A hand punched near the door handle, causing its fingers to curl inward.

Markov let out a laugh that was halfway between hysteria and shock. “Yeah, easy for you to say that while we’re being peeled open like a fucking can of Campbell’s.”

“STOP ARGUING,” Ishkanah snapped from her seat, where she was bracing herself against an amp.

I stared at the side door handle, as my heart pounded so hard it started to blur my vision. The metal surrounding the rear doors bowed inward again, and snow blasted through the holes in harsh, stinging bursts.

N’gath didn’t raise his voice, but instead remained calm as ever somehow. “You do not need to fight it, you only need to distract it.”

The van hit a bump and I slammed shoulder-first into the side of the vehicle. From outside, we could hear an excited scream echo as one of its hands disappeared through the door entirely. It dragged its fingers blindly along the interior metal as Valgavoth glanced in the rearview mirror at the sheer carnage unfolding.

“We’re running out of van!” He yelled before turning his attention back to the road, hands firmly planted on the steering wheel.

“No shit man!” I heard Markov scream as I unlocked the side door before I could second guess my decision. The moment the latch clicked, the door rattled violently and caved inward slightly. I hastily slid the door open, and in a blinding white rush, the icy wind bombarded the interior. 

I shuddered as I gripped the door, watching the road pass by in a blur below. I looked to my left and right, and it was on the right-hand side of the van that I could make out the man clinging sideways to the rear. Like a Spider clinging to a wall, gravity seemed to not have any effect on him in the slightest. 

With unsettling ease, the joints in his body flexed and adjusted with every jolt from our vehicle navigating the road. His knuckles were bloody and worn from the repeated seams and dents it left in the van. 

“What the fuck is going on out there?” Markov asked as he and Ishkanah watched me from inside.

I didn’t think about my next move, I just grabbed the first thing my hand found and held onto it like a lifeline. The mic stand I gripped was slick with the condensation from the palms of my sweaty, bleeding hands. I trembled at the wind tearing at me through the open door but braved the elements enough to slowly lean outside. 

The van rocked abruptly and nearly threw me out, causing me to instinctively grab onto the door and catch my balance. The thing clinging to the rear noticed my stumble and crawled across the metal towards me. Then, in an attempt to keep him at bay, I swung.

The metallic clang from the mic stand rang out on impact with its body and sent a rattling sensation through my arms. Its grip faltered and it shrieked with pain, but it didn’t let go. He hung there with his boots skidding uselessly against the bumper, scrabbling for purchase. With an outstretched arm, he turned toward me, and his blackened eyes locked onto mine. 

I tried to pull back and get the door shut as quickly as possible, but it lunged anyway. His mouth opened so wide that I could see his serrated teeth. 

As the gap between us closed, the van swerved, causing me to stagger and reflexively throw the mic stand up between us. I closed my eyes and felt an abrupt jolt, followed by a sickly thud and the sound of wheezing.

I opened my eyes to find his face pressed close to mine with the mic stand buried through his chest at an angle I hadn’t anticipated. Blood slid down the metal pole in slow, crimson drops that felt eerily warm against my hands. His breath washed over my face, smelling like rancid meat as it shuddered and gasped for life. All I could think in that moment was that I hadn’t meant to do that, I only wanted to make everything stop.

“DUDE YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Markov exclaimed as Ishkanah looked like she was trying her best to refrain from puking.

“You killed him?” N’gath asked as he turned around to see for himself.

“I’m putting this thing in park.” Valgavoth stated coldly as he gently pressed on the brakes and a few moments later, the van had come to a stop next to the guardrail.

I let go of the mic stand and watched the lifeless body whose blood covered my hands fall to the ground outside. I tossed the bloody, bent mic stand into the snow before N’gath could get a good look at it. For a while, the only sounds that could be heard were our ragged breathing, and the drip… drip… drip of gasoline leaking somewhere beneath us.

After what felt like eons, Ishkanah whispered the question that was on everybody’s minds. ”What do we do now?”

I swallowed the bile that had accumulated in my throat. “I’m not sure.”

“Like I told y’all earlier,” Valgavoth said. “We get rid of the body and pretend that none of this ever happened. Had everyone just listened to me we wouldn’t have ended up in this mess.”

“We can’t just pretend we’re safe here, we need to go back home. It’s too dangerous.” I looked at everyone in hopes that they would side with me.

He shook his head in frustration before slamming his hands down on the steering wheel. “In case you’ve forgotten jackass, we have traveled a long way to go to this place that N’gath INSISTED was the perfect place for recording our album. I’m not going to turn around just because some bozo doped up on ketamine or whatever thought that attacking our van in the middle of the night was peak entertainment.”

“He nearly killed us back there! You and I both know that he…he wasn’t human…  ” I explained before drifting off, afraid to finish my thought.

“Oh don’t tell me that you actually believe that this guy is what you’re trying to imply he is.” Valgavoth scoffed. “If you believe that then you’re a bigger dumbass than I thought.”

“No one here is a dumbass.” N’gath replied.

“Let’s just…move past this and work together as a group.” Ishkanah stated, still gripping to the loose equipment tightly as if any moment they could fall out.

“There is no moving past this, we leave now.” I insisted as I tried to reach for the keys in the ignition.

“You’re right, we leave now, but we’re not turning around.” Valgavoth swatted my hand away before I could touch the keys. “Newsflash, I’m the one behind the wheel so I’m in charge. I didn’t just nearly lose my life going up a mountain from your average meth head hanging around a 7/11 to not record this album. Now you guys can either join me or get the fuck out of this van and y’all can party it up out here in the tundra.”

An uncomfortable quiet overtook the van as everyone sat and pondered the next course of action. Nobody wanted to challenge Valgavoth’s stubborn, headstrong nature, but at the same time, nobody wanted to have this trip mean nothing.

“Look, we did come all this way. Let’s just get rid of the body and get out of here.”

That was the most level-headed and down-to-earth response I had ever heard leave Markov’s mouth. His words earned an approving nod from Valgavoth who turned the keys in the ignition to start the van up.

“Now we’re talking. Let’s make this fast, I want to make it to our destination by sunrise so we can get some proper rest.”

The engine purred unevenly as we stepped out into the cold once more, the snowfall and wind biting through our clothes.

Up close, the body looked monstrous in a way I hadn’t noticed before. I tried not to think about it or so much as make eye contact with the body as we lifted and dragged it toward the rail. My boots slipped on the ice, forcing my breath to come out in a burst of panic.

“It’s okay,” Ishkanah whispered quietly, just barely audible above the crunch of the snow. “You’re okay.”

N’gath and Markov nodded in agreement as Valgavoth kept his focus and grip on the body. Her reassurance helped me steady myself as best as I could to complete the task at hand. None of us spoke a word as we approached a narrow turnout where the guardrail bent inward. The area in that spot dropped away into nothing but darkness, and that’s where we decided to dispose of the body.

Together, as one, we heaved. When we went to let go, the coat from the body nearly got caught on the metal rail causing the fabric to snag against the long-rusted bolts. With a united shove from all of us however, the body tipped, rolled, and vanished over the edge.

I’m not entirely sure how long we stood there, but I know it was longer than we should have. We expected to hear a scream, a thud, or something that confirmed gravity still worked the way it was supposed to. But we never heard anything aside from the vast, engulfing sound of silence and its aftermath.

Eventually Valgavoth muttered and broke the silence. “Let’s get back to the van.”

With that, we all walked back to the van, secured the back doors, and got settled in. Valgavoth pressed his foot down on the gas and we surged ahead into the night. 

A little while later, Ishkanah spoke, her voice barely audible above the whir of the engine. “Is this why the town was abandoned?”

Nobody cut through the stunned silence except for Valgavoth who didn’t even bother looking at her.

“No,” he said immediately. “And don’t say that again.”

That was the last time any of us decided to speak.

I’m writing this as we continue toward the chapel, too anxious to feel how exhausted my body must be feeling right now as I’m pressed against the equipment. No one has spoken since we got back on the road, and I don’t think anyone plans to. 

I keep watching the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following us through the snow, but the road behind us is empty from what I can tell. 

A part of me knows we should turn back, that whatever we threw over that guardrail was an omen, but this trip is everything we’ve worked toward, and no one is willing to be the first to say that fear meant more than our dreams. 

If something else happens, I’ll give an update. If I don’t, then understand that nothing stopped us from turning back.

I’m not really sure if this is the right place to explain my story, but I don’t really know if a right place even exists. I’m not exactly sure what we encountered, but I want others to know about it. Let me explain everything from the beginning.

My band isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination, at least not in the mainstream. We formed in the winter of 2019 in a small, snowy town in Colorado and built up our reputation for years in the Black Metal underground scene. 

Our band quickly achieved notoriety for our haunting music, intense live shows, and intimidating aesthetic that was a byproduct of making raw, unpolished music.

Last year, we recorded the entirety of our first demo, \\\*Buried in Impenetrable Darkness\\\*, on a battered to hell tape deck. We borrowed it from our vocalist’s dad and wedged it between old paint cans and a toolbox in the garage we were rehearsing in at the time. 

Every take that we captured and played back made us realize that we had stumbled onto the exact atmosphere we had been striving to achieve since day one. The songs sounded like they had been excavated from a collapsed mineshaft, akin to Darkthrone’s \\\*Transylvanian Hunger\\\*. 

It became the kind of demo that was traded heavily, and rumors spread that the music had been recorded deep inside an abandoned crypt. We never corrected people; we just let the myth become a part of the legacy as much as the music.

Before I go any further, I should explain something. We never use our real names in the band. That’s normal in the Black Metal genre. The scene has always been built on personas and the mythos behind them. You don’t join a band like ours to be “Eric” or “Devin” anymore. You take on a name that sounds like it emerged from the foggiest graveyard. Pseudonyms in this genre aren’t just armor, they’re equal parts secrecy, legend, and ritual. 

My bandmates and I chose names that belonged carved into an ossuary wall rather than printed on a driver’s license. That’s how I became Ulalek, and how the rest of the band became N’gath, Ishkanah, Valgavoth, and Lord Markov.

N’gath towered over the rest of us like some giant, starving medieval saint who was all elbows and cheekbones. His arms looked like they belonged on a marionette, and the corpse-paint tattooed on them was self-inflicted with a stick-and-poke rig he had designed himself after listening to nothing but the Norwegian music scene for months. He possessed the seriousness of a monk, but also the theatrics of a guy who could summon malicious spirits. N’gath rarely spoke offstage, but when he did, his voice was surprisingly gentle, like he was determined to make every word of his count.

Then there was Ishkanah, our lead guitarist. She was someone who looked like she had crawled out of a mossy hollow but also maintained perfect eyeliner. The forest-witch vibe wasn’t just for show; she was devoted to that lifestyle. She collected and stored bones as “art projects”, obsessed over botany, and exclusively drank nothing but her herbal teas. Beneath that mystical exterior though, was someone whose nervous system was in constant overdrive. 

Valgavoth, the smartass of the group, was the one who wielded the bass guitar. He was barrel-chested and sported long, raven-black hair that looked freshly conditioned even though he insisted he washed it only in “mountain rain”. His eyes were always hidden behind sunglasses to “avoid the gaze of God”. Whatever the hell that meant. Despite his flaws, he was the glue that held us together. When rehearsals got ugly, he could shut everyone up with one raised eyebrow behind his shades.

Our drummer Lord Markov didn’t just play the drums; he attacked them like they owed him money. Everything about him was loud: his laugh, his personality, his snare hits. He was notorious for throwing his whole body into every story he told, but for all his chaos, Markov was a genuine soul. 

We were a mess, but we were a family, and a perpetually broke one at that. There’s only so much money you can make in music, let alone metal. 

As passionate as we were, it wasn’t paying the bills. Eventually, after slaving away at our day jobs, we managed to save up enough money to fund production for our first album. It seemed like a big break, but our savings were essentially pissed away in an instant when the engineer we hired to oversee our production ghosted us the day before our recording session. 

We were gutted and didn’t have the faintest clue of what to do. The money that we had was gone, the piece of shit took our money and ran. 

When all seemed lost, N’gath found a place he thought we should go record at. He told us when rehearsals had devolved into Markov pounding on the drums in frustration and Ishkanah spiraling about “rhythmic entropy curves”. 

Valgavoth and I were frustrated and wondering where N’gath went when he drifted in from the hallway like a wraith returning from a pilgrimage. He held his phone with both hands, treating it like it were some coveted relic. Valgavoth gave him a questionable look, prompting him to clear his throat.

He didn’t announce what he had to say; instead, he whispered, “I have found… something,”

Markov stopped mid-drumstick twirl and glared. “If this is another one of your “haunted” locations, I’m out,”

“It’s not a “haunted” location, Markov,” N’gath spoke, his voice calm but papery. “It’s a chapel.”

Ishkanah snapped her head up, pupils way too dilated for someone who claimed she’d “only had two coffees.” “A chapel?” she inquired. “Like… with acoustics? Or with spirits? Or with both? Holy architecture has resonance lines, you know. Some frequencies can—”

Valgavoth, still wearing his perpetual indoor sunglasses, put up a hand. “Before Google here goes on another tangent… what’s so special about this chapel of yours? Why should we give a shit about this place?”

N’gath turned the screen around to show a crumbling stone building perched on the edge of a cliff. Snow had swallowed the trees around it, but it was as haunting as it was beautiful. “It’s in the San Juans. The chapel was built in the 1890s and rumor has it that it was meant for monks who live in the mountains there. It has since been abandoned for reasons unknown. Others say they left because they heard and saw… things.”

“Perfect! Let’s go record there and terrorize whatever’s in the mountains along the way! We could get some cool ghost stories out of this.” Markov smiled the kind of smile that meant he was already packing in his head.

“Guys, shouldn’t we think about this? The mountains? That’s a tall ask of us.” I said, trying to talk some sense into my bandmates.

N’gath continued, ignoring Markov and I. “The article said that the acoustics there are flawless and can make harmonies echo for minutes at a time.” He paused, his voice dipping lower. “It would make us sound like we were conjuring something evil and powerful. Our music will finally have teeth.”

Ishkanah shivered with excitement. “Teeth have a frequency you know. You can hear the tension in enamel if the room’s quiet enough.”

“I swear to God, Ish, sometimes I think you’re just making up words.” Valgavoth shot her a side-eye behind the sunglasses before turning back to N’gath. “So, are we taking a field trip there? We’re just going to Magic School Bus our asses and our gear up a mountain and hope we survive the elements? Great plan Einstein. What if the building collapses on us?”

“What if we don’t make it and we’re stranded up there? What then? I want this as badly as you guys, but I don’t think that the potential payoff is worth the risk.” I voiced my concerns, much to the dismay of Valgavoth.

“Sometimes in life, you have to be willing to risk everything. That’s what being in a band is about.”

N’gath put his phone into his pocket and crossed his arms against his chest. “There is nothing to worry about guys. The route to get there is safe, and the chapel is still structurally sound according to my research.”

“Oh, well if an article said it, then clearly it must be true.” Valgavoth spoke dryly.

Markov slammed his sticks together like a declaration of war. “I’m in! If the mountain wants to fight us, let it. A little snow and ice never scared me! Mom didn’t raise no bitch! I’ll drum on its corpse.”

Valgavoth sighed like a disappointed father before replying, “You can’t drum on a mountain’s corpse you dumbass,”

Markov shot a dirty look at Valgavoth as he twirled his drumsticks idly. 

Ishkanah bounced on her toes in a jittery kinetic blur. “We should test the acoustics with dissonant triads! Or drop-tuned tremolo lines! Or—”

“Lovely,” Valgavoth interrupted. “We’ll die and it’ll be because we annoyed the shit out of a spirit with jazz chords.”

“This could be the breakthrough,” N’gath exhaled slowly. 

“N’gath could be right.” I spoke after sitting on the idea for a moment. “This could be our breakthrough moment. We could finally capture that sound we’ve been looking for at this place.”

For a few seconds after I said that, the room went dead silent. Nobody said anything as everyone thought the situation over in their heads. None of us wanted to admit that we were desperate, but we were. Months of hard work were wasted, and our dreams were hanging on to the hopes that we were impulsive enough to make them a reality.

Seeing everyone so passionate and alive made me have a change of heart about my concerns. Looking at everyone’s faces, I could tell the others felt the same, strange mix of dread and excitement when you’re about to do something profoundly stupid but possibly life-changing. 

N’gath just stood there, hands folded in his sleeves like some gaunt prophet as we all nodded one by one. With no second thoughts, the five of us agreed to drive straight into the mountains with nothing but our gear, worse judgment, and corpse paint.

We packed everything we needed shortly afterward and began taking everything to the shitty white van we owned. As we loaded up the last of the equipment into the van, Valgavoth slid his sunglasses down his nose, and said, “If this thing breaks down on a mountain road and we get eaten by whatever cryptid is trending this month, I’m blaming all of you.”

N’gath didn’t say anything at first. He just placed his microphone gently on top of one of Ishkanah’s amps, like he was tucking a child into bed. Then, softly:

“The spirits of the mountain will guide us.”

“Are the spirits a more reliable guide than Mapquest, N’gath?” Valgavoth rolled his eyes and climbed into the passenger seat.

Ishkanah buckled herself in, eyes wide and bright like she hadn’t slept in three days. “Actually, mountains have specific harmonic signatures—”

“NOPE,” Markov shouted from the back before she could get started. “Not listening to your ramblings again. Last time, I lost a whole weekend.”

N’gath climbed into the driver’s seat as I sat next to Ishkanah, laughing at Markov’s gripes with her. I had barely fastened my seatbelt before the van growled to life, and we rumbled out of the city. 

The van shuddered as it drove down the road, as snow gathered on the edges of the highway in jagged, messy piles. Somewhere between the mile markers, I watched the sky turn a bruise-purple and listened to the engine screech like a dying animal. 

Ishkanah just stared out the window, her voice was unsettlingly calm as she spoke to no one in particular. “They left because they heard and saw things…what was meant by that exactly?”

Valgavoth slowly shook his head in awkward disapproval. “Ish, why are you like this? Haven’t you ever heard of folklore or superstitions?”

“From what I read, the town was evacuated and left abandoned due to a monster.” N’gath whispered, almost to himself. Before I could speak up, I noticed a recognizable golden arch. 

“Pull into that McDonald’s N’gath. I want a goddamn McRib.” Valgavoth pointed at the McDonald’s sign like it was salvation, only for us to discover the building was completely dark. There was not a single soul in the parking lot and the drive-thru menu hung half off its metal frame. 

He cursed under his breath for a full minute before muttering that the universe was “a tasteless bitch.” We all laughed hysterically at his bitterness, our laughter thinning out as we ascended higher into the mountains. 

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, but I remember waking to the sound of \\\*Beyond the Great Vast Forest\\\* by Emperor dissolving into static as our radio lost its signal. I looked out the passenger window to see that the roadside houses I’d been watching earlier had disappeared entirely into the darkness. 

Beyond the narrow cone of light from our dim headlights was but pitch-black pressing in. Snow whipped sideways, causing the asphalt from the road to be swallowed in places that erased the center line of the road entirely. The van hummed unevenly beneath us as the engine strained against the incline, causing the enclosed space to vibrate loudly. 

Valgavoth muttered something about the radio being garbage under his breath and reached for the dial to fix the signal. 

For a while, the only sounds were the engine’s labored whine and the rhythmic slap of snow against the windows. Every sweep of the windshield wipers smeared the world back into white noise. 

There were no signs of life other than the occasional reflective marker flashing and vanishing at the edge of the beams of our headlights. I found myself counting the seconds as I looked out the window, staring out at nothing. 

Suddenly, a heavy thud detonated against the passenger side. The metal of the vehicle boomed and I was driven hard into the door due to the impact, causing the breath to be punched clean out of my lungs. White sparks burst across my vision as N’gath fought the wheel. The van swerved violently across the narrow road toward the snow-choked shoulder before N’gath was able to stabilize the vehicle and snap us back onto the road.

Markov sat up in his seat having been woken up by the impact of whatever we had collided with. “What the hell was that?”

Before anyone could answer, an agonizingly slow, metallic scrape noise pierced the air. 

I turned my head to look outside my window, just in time to see a shape dart across the outside of our vehicle. I didn’t get a clear look, but before I could let anyone know about what I had seen, Ishkanah screamed. 

The roof dented inward and snow slid down the windshield in sheets from the weight pressing down above us.

“There’s someone on the van!” I cried out as another violent jolt rocked us forward.

“Hold on everyone!” N’gath declared through clenched teeth as he jerked the wheel hard to the left, causing us to fishtail. The tires screamed against the ice, the sudden force ripping the shape free from above. 

A sickening thud echoed through the still, night air as the body disappeared into the snowbank and the van came to a screeching halt several yards down the road. N’gath cut the engine and we sat in complete silence for what felt like an eternity trying to process what had just happened. 

Markov was the first to speak, his words being the ones to articulate what everyone else was afraid to speak into existence.

“I think…I think that was a guy.”

My stomach plummeted at the realization. We sat there in the freezing cold of the darkness, our breath fogging the windows as we listened for movement outside.

“We can’t just leave him,” Ishkanah pleaded in a whisper. “If we…if we killed someone—”

“WE…didn’t kill anybody. Got that?” Valgavoth turned in his seat to address us. “We’re going to pretend this didn’t happen and we’re going to drive away from here.”

“Are you fucking mental? We just hit a person and you want us to leave the scene of a crime?!” I cried out in anger as I reached for my door handle.

“We’re in the middle of fucking nowhere in the mountains Sherlock. Who is going to know? Besides, we were attacked first. We could just say it was in self-defense. The bastard was practically asking for this anyways.” 

Against my better judgment, I opened the door and felt the cold sting my face.

“Where are you going?” Markov asked as I unbuckled myself and stepped foot onto the snow-covered road outside.

“To do the right thing.”

No one moved at first. The only sound in the deafening quiet was the snow that continued to fall in thick sheets around the van. I half expected someone to argue or to tell me it was a bad idea, but guilt has a way of settling things faster than logic ever could. One by one, the hinges of the doors squeaked open, and seconds later, the sound of boots crunching in the snow could be heard following me. 

The darkness engulfed everything but the weak, yellow glow of our headlights as we made our way through the snow and into the treeline. My heart pounded harder with every step as the skid marks and churned powder morphed into dark smears until we approached the limp body at the end of the trail. 

“Jesus,” Markov whispered, his breath lingered in the air in a pale, trembling mist. “We killed him.”

I took another step closer, my boots crunching softly against the frozen terrain. Up close, something was off in a way I couldn’t articulate at the time. His clothes consisted of an old-fashioned dark coat and boots with no tread that were buried beneath the snow. The man’s chest didn’t rise, but I thought I saw the fingers of the arm twisted beneath him twitch.

“Guys, I think I saw movement.” I stated aloud as I approached and felt the ice-cold temperature of his hand against mine.

“We need to get him to a hospital!” Ishkanah declared as she crouched beside me to inspect the body.

Valgavoth rolled his eyes in annoyance. “We’re not taking him anywhere. He’s dead. End of story. Now let’s get back into the van before we freeze to death out here.” 

Before we could even acknowledge Valgavoth’s comment, the man’s eyes shot open. His pitch-black pupils reflected the van’s headlights before locking onto me. 

I didn’t have time to react. 

One moment he was in a crumbled heap in the snow, and the next he was airborne with the sudden and complete awareness of a predator.

The man tackled me and sent me sprawling backward hard enough to drive the air from my lungs in a panicked gasp. I screamed in terror as the man’s hands clamped down on both of my shoulders. His mouth ripped and tore at my hands as I raised them defensively on instinct. 

The demented and choked growling sound the man made didn’t sound like anything I had ever heard. It sounded ancient, primal, and most terrifying of all, hungry. His teeth scraped against the flesh of my hands, causing light drops of blood to fall onto my clothes. 

Ishkanah lunged forward instinctively, her fingers closing around my arm to pull me away, but the man reacted without turning to her. He struck her with one arm; the force sent her tumbling into the snow several feet away. She hit the ground hard, and her body let out a weak groan as she struggled to sit up.

“RUN!” Valgavoth shouted, his voice cracking as he rushed towards Ishkanah to drag her to safety while N’gath and Markov came to my aid.

Markov grabbed a nearby rock and launched it at the man’s head to seemingly no effect. N’gath found a decently sized tree branch on the ground and started whacking the man over the head with it in an effort to get him off of me.

After several sick thuds to the skull, the man lifted his head slowly. It was in that moment that we noticed that he wasn’t a man at all. He was something else entirely.

His mouth was dripping wet with saliva as he flashed his teeth and turned toward N’gath and Markov. I knew I had a small window of opportunity in that moment, so I took advantage of the distraction and pushed the man off me. 

I began running back to the van with the others, turning back once to see the frenzied gaze in the man’s eyes as we sprinted. The bitter cold tore at my legs and my lungs felt like they were on fire as we got closer to the van. 

Behind us, we heard a shrill scream echo as the man continued his pursuit. The headlights in the distance signaled safety as Valgavoth and Ishkanah were the first to reach the van.

Valgavoth helped Ishkanah get inside and yanked the driver’s side door open just as the rest of us were able to pile inside in a blind panic. Not even a moment later, the man slammed into the side of the vehicle, causing the entire van to shake. The metal groaned from the impact, the van nearly tipping over on its side.

“GO!” Markov yelled with urgency as Valgavoth turned to N’gath.

“GIMME THE FUCKING KEYS!!!” 

N’gath frantically searched his pockets and tossed them to Valgavoth. Outside, there was another screech and another thud that made the van slide a few feet across the road. Valgavoth turned the keys in the ignition, and floored it out of there.

The van jerked forward violently as we took off, but we were not alone. The man clung to the rear door and punched through the steel with his long, pale fingers. Under the immense pressure and strength of our attacker, the doors buckled and the metal began being ripped apart like paper.

“If he tears the doors open, we’re going to lose our equipment!” Markov shouted as he looked to Valgavoth for ideas.

Valgavoth never took his eyes off the road. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting from me, I’m the one driving!”

That’s when N’gath chimed in. “Ulalek, unlock the door and see if you can knock him off somehow.”

“Have you lost your goddamn mind?!” I protested. “How do you expect me to get this dude off our van?”

“FIGURE IT OUT!” Valgavoth jerked the wheel again, harder this time. The van’s tires screeched as we narrowly avoided contact with the guardrail. Whoever, or rather, whatever was clinging to the back barely reacted. A hand punched near the door handle, causing its fingers to curl inward.

Markov let out a laugh that was halfway between hysteria and shock. “Yeah, easy for you to say that while we’re being peeled open like a fucking can of Campbell’s.”

“STOP ARGUING,” Ishkanah snapped from her seat, where she was bracing herself against an amp.

I stared at the side door handle, as my heart pounded so hard it started to blur my vision. The metal surrounding the rear doors bowed inward again, and snow blasted through the holes in harsh, stinging bursts.

N’gath didn’t raise his voice, but instead remained calm as ever somehow. “You do not need to fight it, you only need to distract it.”

The van hit a bump and I slammed shoulder-first into the side of the vehicle. From outside, we could hear an excited scream echo as one of its hands disappeared through the door entirely. It dragged its fingers blindly along the interior metal as Valgavoth glanced in the rearview mirror at the sheer carnage unfolding.

“We’re running out of van!” He yelled before turning his attention back to the road, hands firmly planted on the steering wheel.

“No shit man!” I heard Markov scream as I unlocked the side door before I could second guess my decision. The moment the latch clicked, the door rattled violently and caved inward slightly. I hastily slid the door open, and in a blinding white rush, the icy wind bombarded the interior. 

I shuddered as I gripped the door, watching the road pass by in a blur below. I looked to my left and right, and it was on the right-hand side of the van that I could make out the man clinging sideways to the rear. Like a Spider clinging to a wall, gravity seemed to not have any effect on him in the slightest. 

With unsettling ease, the joints in his body flexed and adjusted with every jolt from our vehicle navigating the road. His knuckles were bloody and worn from the repeated seams and dents it left in the van. 

“What the fuck is going on out there?” Markov asked as he and Ishkanah watched me from inside.

I didn’t think about my next move, I just grabbed the first thing my hand found and held onto it like a lifeline. The mic stand I gripped was slick with the condensation from the palms of my sweaty, bleeding hands. I trembled at the wind tearing at me through the open door but braved the elements enough to slowly lean outside. 

The van rocked abruptly and nearly threw me out, causing me to instinctively grab onto the door and catch my balance. The thing clinging to the rear noticed my stumble and crawled across the metal towards me. Then, in an attempt to keep him at bay, I swung.

The metallic clang from the mic stand rang out on impact with its body and sent a rattling sensation through my arms. Its grip faltered and it shrieked with pain, but it didn’t let go. He hung there with his boots skidding uselessly against the bumper, scrabbling for purchase. With an outstretched arm, he turned toward me, and his blackened eyes locked onto mine. 

I tried to pull back and get the door shut as quickly as possible, but it lunged anyway. His mouth opened so wide that I could see his serrated teeth. 

As the gap between us closed, the van swerved, causing me to stagger and reflexively throw the mic stand up between us. I closed my eyes and felt an abrupt jolt, followed by a sickly thud and the sound of wheezing.

I opened my eyes to find his face pressed close to mine with the mic stand buried through his chest at an angle I hadn’t anticipated. Blood slid down the metal pole in slow, crimson drops that felt eerily warm against my hands. His breath washed over my face, smelling like rancid meat as it shuddered and gasped for life. All I could think in that moment was that I hadn’t meant to do that, I only wanted to make everything stop.

“DUDE YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Markov exclaimed as Ishkanah looked like she was trying her best to refrain from puking.

“You killed him?” N’gath asked as he turned around to see for himself.

“I’m putting this thing in park.” Valgavoth stated coldly as he gently pressed on the brakes and a few moments later, the van had come to a stop next to the guardrail.

I let go of the mic stand and watched the lifeless body whose blood covered my hands fall to the ground outside. I tossed the bloody, bent mic stand into the snow before N’gath could get a good look at it. For a while, the only sounds that could be heard were our ragged breathing, and the drip… drip… drip of gasoline leaking somewhere beneath us.

After what felt like eons, Ishkanah whispered the question that was on everybody’s minds. ”What do we do now?”

I swallowed the bile that had accumulated in my throat. “I’m not sure.”

“Like I told y’all earlier,” Valgavoth said. “We get rid of the body and pretend that none of this ever happened. Had everyone just listened to me we wouldn’t have ended up in this mess.”

“We can’t just pretend we’re safe here, we need to go back home. It’s too dangerous.” I looked at everyone in hopes that they would side with me.

He shook his head in frustration before slamming his hands down on the steering wheel. “In case you’ve forgotten jackass, we have traveled a long way to go to this place that N’gath INSISTED was the perfect place for recording our album. I’m not going to turn around just because some bozo doped up on ketamine or whatever thought that attacking our van in the middle of the night was peak entertainment.”

“He nearly killed us back there! You and I both know that he…he wasn’t human…  ” I explained before drifting off, afraid to finish my thought.

“Oh don’t tell me that you actually believe that this guy is what you’re trying to imply he is.” Valgavoth scoffed. “If you believe that then you’re a bigger dumbass than I thought.”

“No one here is a dumbass.” N’gath replied.

“Let’s just…move past this and work together as a group.” Ishkanah stated, still gripping to the loose equipment tightly as if any moment they could fall out.

“There is no moving past this, we leave now.” I insisted as I tried to reach for the keys in the ignition.

“You’re right, we leave now, but we’re not turning around.” Valgavoth swatted my hand away before I could touch the keys. “Newsflash, I’m the one behind the wheel so I’m in charge. I didn’t just nearly lose my life going up a mountain from your average meth head hanging around a 7/11 to not record this album. Now you guys can either join me or get the fuck out of this van and y’all can party it up out here in the tundra.”

An uncomfortable quiet overtook the van as everyone sat and pondered the next course of action. Nobody wanted to challenge Valgavoth’s stubborn, headstrong nature, but at the same time, nobody wanted to have this trip mean nothing.

“Look, we did come all this way. Let’s just get rid of the body and get out of here.”

That was the most level-headed and down-to-earth response I had ever heard leave Markov’s mouth. His words earned an approving nod from Valgavoth who turned the keys in the ignition to start the van up.

“Now we’re talking. Let’s make this fast, I want to make it to our destination by sunrise so we can get some proper rest.”

The engine purred unevenly as we stepped out into the cold once more, the snowfall and wind biting through our clothes.

Up close, the body looked monstrous in a way I hadn’t noticed before. I tried not to think about it or so much as make eye contact with the body as we lifted and dragged it toward the rail. My boots slipped on the ice, forcing my breath to come out in a burst of panic.

“It’s okay,” Ishkanah whispered quietly, just barely audible above the crunch of the snow. “You’re okay.”

N’gath and Markov nodded in agreement as Valgavoth kept his focus and grip on the body. Her reassurance helped me steady myself as best as I could to complete the task at hand. None of us spoke a word as we approached a narrow turnout where the guardrail bent inward. The area in that spot dropped away into nothing but darkness, and that’s where we decided to dispose of the body.

Together, as one, we heaved. When we went to let go, the coat from the body nearly got caught on the metal rail causing the fabric to snag against the long-rusted bolts. With a united shove from all of us however, the body tipped, rolled, and vanished over the edge.

I’m not entirely sure how long we stood there, but I know it was longer than we should have. We expected to hear a scream, a thud, or something that confirmed gravity still worked the way it was supposed to. But we never heard anything aside from the vast, engulfing sound of silence and its aftermath.

Eventually Valgavoth muttered and broke the silence. “Let’s get back to the van.”

With that, we all walked back to the van, secured the back doors, and got settled in. Valgavoth pressed his foot down on the gas and we surged ahead into the night. 

A little while later, Ishkanah spoke, her voice barely audible above the whir of the engine. “Is this why the town was abandoned?”

Nobody cut through the stunned silence except for Valgavoth who didn’t even bother looking at her.

“No,” he said immediately. “And don’t say that again.”

That was the last time any of us decided to speak.

I’m writing this as we continue toward the chapel, too anxious to feel how exhausted my body must be feeling right now as I’m pressed against the equipment. No one has spoken since we got back on the road, and I don’t think anyone plans to. 

I keep watching the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following us through the snow, but the road behind us is empty from what I can tell. 

A part of me knows we should turn back, that whatever we threw over that guardrail was an omen, but this trip is everything we’ve worked toward, and no one is willing to be the first to say that fear meant more than our dreams. 

If something else happens, I’ll give an update. If I don’t, then understand that nothing stopped us from turning back.

I’m not really sure if this is the right place to explain my story, but I don’t really know if a right place even exists. I’m not exactly sure what we encountered, but I want others to know about it. Let me explain everything from the beginning.

My band isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination, at least not in the mainstream. We formed in the winter of 2019 in a small, snowy town in Colorado and built up our reputation for years in the Black Metal underground scene. 

Our band quickly achieved notoriety for our haunting music, intense live shows, and intimidating aesthetic that was a byproduct of making raw, unpolished music.

Last year, we recorded the entirety of our first demo, \\\*Buried in Impenetrable Darkness\\\*, on a battered to hell tape deck. We borrowed it from our vocalist’s dad and wedged it between old paint cans and a toolbox in the garage we were rehearsing in at the time. 

Every take that we captured and played back made us realize that we had stumbled onto the exact atmosphere we had been striving to achieve since day one. The songs sounded like they had been excavated from a collapsed mineshaft, akin to Darkthrone’s \\\*Transylvanian Hunger\\\*. 

It became the kind of demo that was traded heavily, and rumors spread that the music had been recorded deep inside an abandoned crypt. We never corrected people; we just let the myth become a part of the legacy as much as the music.

The scene has always been built on personas and the mythos behind them. You don’t join a band like ours to be “Eric” or “Devin” anymore. You take on a name that sounds like it emerged from the foggiest graveyard. Pseudonyms in this genre aren’t just armor, they’re equal parts secrecy, legend, and ritual. 

My bandmates and I chose names that belonged carved into an ossuary wall rather than printed on a driver’s license. That’s how I became Ulalek, and how the rest of the band became N’gath, Ishkanah, Valgavoth, and Lord Markov.

N’gath towered over the rest of us like some giant, starving medieval saint who was all elbows and cheekbones. His arms looked like they belonged on a marionette, and the corpse-paint tattooed on them was self-inflicted with a stick-and-poke rig he had designed himself after listening to nothing but the Norwegian music scene for months. He possessed the seriousness of a monk, but also the theatrics of a guy who could summon malicious spirits. N’gath rarely spoke offstage, but when he did, his voice was surprisingly gentle, like he was determined to make every word of his count.

Then there was Ishkanah, our lead guitarist. She was someone who looked like she had crawled out of a mossy hollow but also maintained perfect eyeliner. The forest-witch vibe wasn’t just for show; she was devoted to that lifestyle. She collected and stored bones as “art projects”, obsessed over botany, and exclusively drank nothing but her herbal teas. Beneath that mystical exterior though, was someone whose nervous system was in constant overdrive. 

Valgavoth, the smartass of the group, was the one who wielded the bass guitar. He was barrel-chested and sported long, raven-black hair that looked freshly conditioned even though he insisted he washed it only in “mountain rain”. His eyes were always hidden behind sunglasses to “avoid the gaze of God”. Whatever the hell that meant. Despite his flaws, he was the glue that held us together. When rehearsals got ugly, he could shut everyone up with one raised eyebrow behind his shades.

Our drummer Lord Markov didn’t just play the drums; he attacked them like they owed him money. Everything about him was loud: his laugh, his personality, his snare hits. He was notorious for throwing his whole body into every story he told, but for all his chaos, Markov was a genuine soul. 

We were a mess, but we were a family, and a perpetually broke one at that. There’s only so much money you can make in music, let alone metal. 

As passionate as we were, it wasn’t paying the bills. Eventually, after slaving away at our day jobs, we managed to save up enough money to fund production for our first album. It seemed like a big break, but our savings were essentially pissed away in an instant when the engineer we hired to oversee our production ghosted us the day before our recording session. 

We were gutted and didn’t have the faintest clue of what to do. The money that we had was gone, the piece of shit took our money and ran. 

When all seemed lost, N’gath found a place he thought we should go record at. He told us when rehearsals had devolved into Markov pounding on the drums in frustration and Ishkanah spiraling about “rhythmic entropy curves”. 

Valgavoth and I were frustrated and wondering where N’gath went when he drifted in from the hallway like a wraith returning from a pilgrimage. He held his phone with both hands, treating it like it were some coveted relic. Valgavoth gave him a questionable look, prompting him to clear his throat.

He didn’t announce what he had to say; instead, he whispered, “I have found… something,”

Markov stopped mid-drumstick twirl and glared. “If this is another one of your “haunted” locations, I’m out,”

“It’s not a “haunted” location, Markov,” N’gath spoke, his voice calm but papery. “It’s a chapel.”

Ishkanah snapped her head up, pupils way too dilated for someone who claimed she’d “only had two coffees.” “A chapel?” she inquired. “Like… with acoustics? Or with spirits? Or with both? Holy architecture has resonance lines, you know. Some frequencies can—”

Valgavoth, still wearing his perpetual indoor sunglasses, put up a hand. “Before Google here goes on another tangent… what’s so special about this chapel of yours? Why should we give a shit about this place?”

N’gath turned the screen around to show a crumbling stone building perched on the edge of a cliff. Snow had swallowed the trees around it, but it was as haunting as it was beautiful. “It’s in the San Juans. The chapel was built in the 1890s and rumor has it that it was meant for monks who live in the mountains there. It has since been abandoned for reasons unknown. Others say they left because they heard and saw… things.”

“Perfect! Let’s go record there and terrorize whatever’s in the mountains along the way! We could get some cool ghost stories out of this.” Markov smiled the kind of smile that meant he was already packing in his head.

“Guys, shouldn’t we think about this? The mountains? That’s a tall ask of us.” I said, trying to talk some sense into my bandmates.

N’gath continued, ignoring Markov and I. “The article said that the acoustics there are flawless and can make harmonies echo for minutes at a time.” He paused, his voice dipping lower. “It would make us sound like we were conjuring something evil and powerful. Our music will finally have teeth.”

Ishkanah shivered with excitement. “Teeth have a frequency you know. You can hear the tension in enamel if the room’s quiet enough.”

“I swear to God, Ish, sometimes I think you’re just making up words.” Valgavoth shot her a side-eye behind the sunglasses before turning back to N’gath. “So, are we taking a field trip there? We’re just going to Magic School Bus our asses and our gear up a mountain and hope we survive the elements? Great plan Einstein. What if the building collapses on us?”

“What if we don’t make it and we’re stranded up there? What then? I want this as badly as you guys, but I don’t think that the potential payoff is worth the risk.” I voiced my concerns, much to the dismay of Valgavoth.

“Sometimes in life, you have to be willing to risk everything. That’s what being in a band is about.”

N’gath put his phone into his pocket and crossed his arms against his chest. “There is nothing to worry about guys. The route to get there is safe, and the chapel is still structurally sound according to my research.”

“Oh, well if an article said it, then clearly it must be true.” Valgavoth spoke dryly.

Markov slammed his sticks together like a declaration of war. “I’m in! If the mountain wants to fight us, let it. A little snow and ice never scared me! Mom didn’t raise no bitch! I’ll drum on its corpse.”

Valgavoth sighed like a disappointed father before replying, “You can’t drum on a mountain’s corpse you dumbass,”

Markov shot a dirty look at Valgavoth as he twirled his drumsticks idly. 

Ishkanah bounced on her toes in a jittery kinetic blur. “We should test the acoustics with dissonant triads! Or drop-tuned tremolo lines! Or—”

“Lovely,” Valgavoth interrupted. “We’ll die and it’ll be because we annoyed the shit out of a spirit with jazz chords.”

“This could be the breakthrough,” N’gath exhaled slowly. 

“N’gath could be right.” I spoke after sitting on the idea for a moment. “This could be our breakthrough moment. We could finally capture that sound we’ve been looking for at this place.”

For a few seconds after I said that, the room went dead silent. Nobody said anything as everyone thought the situation over in their heads. None of us wanted to admit that we were desperate, but we were. Months of hard work were wasted, and our dreams were hanging on to the hopes that we were impulsive enough to make them a reality.

Seeing everyone so passionate and alive made me have a change of heart about my concerns. Looking at everyone’s faces, I could tell the others felt the same, strange mix of dread and excitement when you’re about to do something profoundly stupid but possibly life-changing. 

N’gath just stood there, hands folded in his sleeves like some gaunt prophet as we all nodded one by one. With no second thoughts, the five of us agreed to drive straight into the mountains with nothing but our gear, worse judgment, and corpse paint.

We packed everything we needed shortly afterward and began taking everything to the shitty white van we owned. As we loaded up the last of the equipment into the van, Valgavoth slid his sunglasses down his nose, and said, “If this thing breaks down on a mountain road and we get eaten by whatever cryptid is trending this month, I’m blaming all of you.”

N’gath didn’t say anything at first. He just placed his microphone gently on top of one of Ishkanah’s amps, like he was tucking a child into bed. Then, softly:

“The spirits of the mountain will guide us.”

“Are the spirits a more reliable guide than Mapquest, N’gath?” Valgavoth rolled his eyes and climbed into the passenger seat.

Ishkanah buckled herself in, eyes wide and bright like she hadn’t slept in three days. “Actually, mountains have specific harmonic signatures—”

“NOPE,” Markov shouted from the back before she could get started. “Not listening to your ramblings again. Last time, I lost a whole weekend.”

N’gath climbed into the driver’s seat as I sat next to Ishkanah, laughing at Markov’s gripes with her. I had barely fastened my seatbelt before the van growled to life, and we rumbled out of the city. 

The van shuddered as it drove down the road, as snow gathered on the edges of the highway in jagged, messy piles. Somewhere between the mile markers, I watched the sky turn a bruise-purple and listened to the engine screech like a dying animal. 

Ishkanah just stared out the window, her voice was unsettlingly calm as she spoke to no one in particular. “They left because they heard and saw things…what was meant by that exactly?”

Valgavoth slowly shook his head in awkward disapproval. “Ish, why are you like this? Haven’t you ever heard of folklore or superstitions?”

“From what I read, the town was evacuated and left abandoned due to a monster.” N’gath whispered, almost to himself. Before I could speak up, I noticed a recognizable golden arch. 

“Pull into that McDonald’s N’gath. I want a goddamn McRib.” Valgavoth pointed at the McDonald’s sign like it was salvation, only for us to discover the building was completely dark. There was not a single soul in the parking lot and the drive-thru menu hung half off its metal frame. 

He cursed under his breath for a full minute before muttering that the universe was “a tasteless bitch.” We all laughed hysterically at his bitterness, our laughter thinning out as we ascended higher into the mountains. 

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, but I remember waking to the sound of \\\*Beyond the Great Vast Forest\\\* by Emperor dissolving into static as our radio lost its signal. I looked out the passenger window to see that the roadside houses I’d been watching earlier had disappeared entirely into the darkness. 

Beyond the narrow cone of light from our dim headlights was but pitch-black pressing in. Snow whipped sideways, causing the asphalt from the road to be swallowed in places that erased the center line of the road entirely. The van hummed unevenly beneath us as the engine strained against the incline, causing the enclosed space to vibrate loudly. 

Valgavoth muttered something about the radio being garbage under his breath and reached for the dial to fix the signal. 

For a while, the only sounds were the engine’s labored whine and the rhythmic slap of snow against the windows. Every sweep of the windshield wipers smeared the world back into white noise. 

There were no signs of life other than the occasional reflective marker flashing and vanishing at the edge of the beams of our headlights. I found myself counting the seconds as I looked out the window, staring out at nothing. 

Suddenly, a heavy thud detonated against the passenger side. The metal of the vehicle boomed and I was driven hard into the door due to the impact, causing the breath to be punched clean out of my lungs. White sparks burst across my vision as N’gath fought the wheel. The van swerved violently across the narrow road toward the snow-choked shoulder before N’gath was able to stabilize the vehicle and snap us back onto the road.

Markov sat up in his seat having been woken up by the impact of whatever we had collided with. “What the hell was that?”

Before anyone could answer, an agonizingly slow, metallic scrape noise pierced the air. 

I turned my head to look outside my window, just in time to see a shape dart across the outside of our vehicle. I didn’t get a clear look, but before I could let anyone know about what I had seen, Ishkanah screamed. 

The roof dented inward and snow slid down the windshield in sheets from the weight pressing down above us.

“There’s someone on the van!” I cried out as another violent jolt rocked us forward.

“Hold on everyone!” N’gath declared through clenched teeth as he jerked the wheel hard to the left, causing us to fishtail. The tires screamed against the ice, the sudden force ripping the shape free from above. 

A sickening thud echoed through the still, night air as the body disappeared into the snowbank and the van came to a screeching halt several yards down the road. N’gath cut the engine and we sat in complete silence for what felt like an eternity trying to process what had just happened. 

Markov was the first to speak, his words being the ones to articulate what everyone else was afraid to speak into existence.

“I think…I think that was a guy.”

My stomach plummeted at the realization. We sat there in the freezing cold of the darkness, our breath fogging the windows as we listened for movement outside.

“We can’t just leave him,” Ishkanah pleaded in a whisper. “If we…if we killed someone—”

“WE…didn’t kill anybody. Got that?” Valgavoth turned in his seat to address us. “We’re going to pretend this didn’t happen and we’re going to drive away from here.”

“Are you fucking mental? We just hit a person and you want us to leave the scene of a crime?!” I cried out in anger as I reached for my door handle.

“We’re in the middle of fucking nowhere in the mountains Sherlock. Who is going to know? Besides, we were attacked first. We could just say it was in self-defense. The bastard was practically asking for this anyways.” 

Against my better judgment, I opened the door and felt the cold sting my face.

“Where are you going?” Markov asked as I unbuckled myself and stepped foot onto the snow-covered road outside.

“To do the right thing.”

No one moved at first. The only sound in the deafening quiet was the snow that continued to fall in thick sheets around the van. I half expected someone to argue or to tell me it was a bad idea, but guilt has a way of settling things faster than logic ever could. One by one, the hinges of the doors squeaked open, and seconds later, the sound of boots crunching in the snow could be heard following me. 

The darkness engulfed everything but the weak, yellow glow of our headlights as we made our way through the snow and into the treeline. My heart pounded harder with every step as the skid marks and churned powder morphed into dark smears until we approached the limp body at the end of the trail. 

“Jesus,” Markov whispered, his breath lingered in the air in a pale, trembling mist. “We killed him.”

I took another step closer, my boots crunching softly against the frozen terrain. Up close, something was off in a way I couldn’t articulate at the time. His clothes consisted of an old-fashioned dark coat and boots with no tread that were buried beneath the snow. The man’s chest didn’t rise, but I thought I saw the fingers of the arm twisted beneath him twitch.

“Guys, I think I saw movement.” I stated aloud as I approached and felt the ice-cold temperature of his hand against mine.

“We need to get him to a hospital!” Ishkanah declared as she crouched beside me to inspect the body.

Valgavoth rolled his eyes in annoyance. “We’re not taking him anywhere. He’s dead. End of story. Now let’s get back into the van before we freeze to death out here.” 

Before we could even acknowledge Valgavoth’s comment, the man’s eyes shot open. His pitch-black pupils reflected the van’s headlights before locking onto me. 

I didn’t have time to react. 

One moment he was in a crumbled heap in the snow, and the next he was airborne with the sudden and complete awareness of a predator.

The man tackled me and sent me sprawling backward hard enough to drive the air from my lungs in a panicked gasp. I screamed in terror as the man’s hands clamped down on both of my shoulders. His mouth ripped and tore at my hands as I raised them defensively on instinct. 

The demented and choked growling sound the man made didn’t sound like anything I had ever heard. It sounded ancient, primal, and most terrifying of all, hungry. His teeth scraped against the flesh of my hands, causing light drops of blood to fall onto my clothes. 

Ishkanah lunged forward instinctively, her fingers closing around my arm to pull me away, but the man reacted without turning to her. He struck her with one arm; the force sent her tumbling into the snow several feet away. She hit the ground hard, and her body let out a weak groan as she struggled to sit up.

“RUN!” Valgavoth shouted, his voice cracking as he rushed towards Ishkanah to drag her to safety while N’gath and Markov came to my aid.

Markov grabbed a nearby rock and launched it at the man’s head to seemingly no effect. N’gath found a decently sized tree branch on the ground and started whacking the man over the head with it in an effort to get him off of me.

After several sick thuds to the skull, the man lifted his head slowly. It was in that moment that we noticed that he wasn’t a man at all. He was something else entirely.

His mouth was dripping wet with saliva as he flashed his teeth and turned toward N’gath and Markov. I knew I had a small window of opportunity in that moment, so I took advantage of the distraction and pushed the man off me. 

I began running back to the van with the others, turning back once to see the frenzied gaze in the man’s eyes as we sprinted. The bitter cold tore at my legs and my lungs felt like they were on fire as we got closer to the van. 

Behind us, we heard a shrill scream echo as the man continued his pursuit. The headlights in the distance signaled safety as Valgavoth and Ishkanah were the first to reach the van.

Valgavoth helped Ishkanah get inside and yanked the driver’s side door open just as the rest of us were able to pile inside in a blind panic. Not even a moment later, the man slammed into the side of the vehicle, causing the entire van to shake. The metal groaned from the impact, the van nearly tipping over on its side.

“GO!” Markov yelled with urgency as Valgavoth turned to N’gath.

“GIMME THE FUCKING KEYS!!!” 

N’gath frantically searched his pockets and tossed them to Valgavoth. Outside, there was another screech and another thud that made the van slide a few feet across the road. Valgavoth turned the keys in the ignition, and floored it out of there.

The van jerked forward violently as we took off, but we were not alone. The man clung to the rear door and punched through the steel with his long, pale fingers. Under the immense pressure and strength of our attacker, the doors buckled and the metal began being ripped apart like paper.

“If he tears the doors open, we’re going to lose our equipment!” Markov shouted as he looked to Valgavoth for ideas.

Valgavoth never took his eyes off the road. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting from me, I’m the one driving!”

That’s when N’gath chimed in. “Ulalek, unlock the door and see if you can knock him off somehow.”

“Have you lost your goddamn mind?!” I protested. “How do you expect me to get this dude off our van?”

“FIGURE IT OUT!” Valgavoth jerked the wheel again, harder this time. The van’s tires screeched as we narrowly avoided contact with the guardrail. Whoever, or rather, whatever was clinging to the back barely reacted. A hand punched near the door handle, causing its fingers to curl inward.

Markov let out a laugh that was halfway between hysteria and shock. “Yeah, easy for you to say that while we’re being peeled open like a fucking can of Campbell’s.”

“STOP ARGUING,” Ishkanah snapped from her seat, where she was bracing herself against an amp.

I stared at the side door handle, as my heart pounded so hard it started to blur my vision. The metal surrounding the rear doors bowed inward again, and snow blasted through the holes in harsh, stinging bursts.

N’gath didn’t raise his voice, but instead remained calm as ever somehow. “You do not need to fight it, you only need to distract it.”

The van hit a bump and I slammed shoulder-first into the side of the vehicle. From outside, we could hear an excited scream echo as one of its hands disappeared through the door entirely. It dragged its fingers blindly along the interior metal as Valgavoth glanced in the rearview mirror at the sheer carnage unfolding.

“We’re running out of van!” He yelled before turning his attention back to the road, hands firmly planted on the steering wheel.

“No shit man!” I heard Markov scream as I unlocked the side door before I could second guess my decision. The moment the latch clicked, the door rattled violently and caved inward slightly. I hastily slid the door open, and in a blinding white rush, the icy wind bombarded the interior. 

I shuddered as I gripped the door, watching the road pass by in a blur below. I looked to my left and right, and it was on the right-hand side of the van that I could make out the man clinging sideways to the rear. Like a Spider clinging to a wall, gravity seemed to not have any effect on him in the slightest. 

With unsettling ease, the joints in his body flexed and adjusted with every jolt from our vehicle navigating the road. His knuckles were bloody and worn from the repeated seams and dents it left in the van. 

“What the fuck is going on out there?” Markov asked as he and Ishkanah watched me from inside.

I didn’t think about my next move, I just grabbed the first thing my hand found and held onto it like a lifeline. The mic stand I gripped was slick with the condensation from the palms of my sweaty, bleeding hands. I trembled at the wind tearing at me through the open door but braved the elements enough to slowly lean outside. 

The van rocked abruptly and nearly threw me out, causing me to instinctively grab onto the door and catch my balance. The thing clinging to the rear noticed my stumble and crawled across the metal towards me. Then, in an attempt to keep him at bay, I swung.

The metallic clang from the mic stand rang out on impact with its body and sent a rattling sensation through my arms. Its grip faltered and it shrieked with pain, but it didn’t let go. He hung there with his boots skidding uselessly against the bumper, scrabbling for purchase. With an outstretched arm, he turned toward me, and his blackened eyes locked onto mine. 

I tried to pull back and get the door shut as quickly as possible, but it lunged anyway. His mouth opened so wide that I could see his serrated teeth. 

As the gap between us closed, the van swerved, causing me to stagger and reflexively throw the mic stand up between us. I closed my eyes and felt an abrupt jolt, followed by a sickly thud and the sound of wheezing.

I opened my eyes to find his face pressed close to mine with the mic stand buried through his chest at an angle I hadn’t anticipated. Blood slid down the metal pole in slow, crimson drops that felt eerily warm against my hands. His breath washed over my face, smelling like rancid meat as it shuddered and gasped for life. All I could think in that moment was that I hadn’t meant to do that, I only wanted to make everything stop.

“DUDE YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Markov exclaimed as Ishkanah looked like she was trying her best to refrain from puking.

“You killed him?” N’gath asked as he turned around to see for himself.

“I’m putting this thing in park.” Valgavoth stated coldly as he gently pressed on the brakes and a few moments later, the van had come to a stop next to the guardrail.

I let go of the mic stand and watched the lifeless body whose blood covered my hands fall to the ground outside. I tossed the bloody, bent mic stand into the snow before N’gath could get a good look at it. For a while, the only sounds that could be heard were our ragged breathing, and the drip… drip… drip of gasoline leaking somewhere beneath us.

After what felt like eons, Ishkanah whispered the question that was on everybody’s minds. ”What do we do now?”

I swallowed the bile that had accumulated in my throat. “I’m not sure.”

“Like I told y’all earlier,” Valgavoth said. “We get rid of the body and pretend that none of this ever happened. Had everyone just listened to me we wouldn’t have ended up in this mess.”

“We can’t just pretend we’re safe here, we need to go back home. It’s too dangerous.” I looked at everyone in hopes that they would side with me.

He shook his head in frustration before slamming his hands down on the steering wheel. “In case you’ve forgotten jackass, we have traveled a long way to go to this place that N’gath INSISTED was the perfect place for recording our album. I’m not going to turn around just because some bozo doped up on ketamine or whatever thought that attacking our van in the middle of the night was peak entertainment.”

“He nearly killed us back there! You and I both know that he…he wasn’t human…  ” I explained before drifting off, afraid to finish my thought.

“Oh don’t tell me that you actually believe that this guy is what you’re trying to imply he is.” Valgavoth scoffed. “If you believe that then you’re a bigger dumbass than I thought.”

“No one here is a dumbass.” N’gath replied.

“Let’s just…move past this and work together as a group.” Ishkanah stated, still gripping to the loose equipment tightly as if any moment they could fall out.

“There is no moving past this, we leave now.” I insisted as I tried to reach for the keys in the ignition.

“You’re right, we leave now, but we’re not turning around.” Valgavoth swatted my hand away before I could touch the keys. “Newsflash, I’m the one behind the wheel so I’m in charge. I didn’t just nearly lose my life going up a mountain from your average meth head hanging around a 7/11 to not record this album. Now you guys can either join me or get the fuck out of this van and y’all can party it up out here in the tundra.”

An uncomfortable quiet overtook the van as everyone sat and pondered the next course of action. Nobody wanted to challenge Valgavoth’s stubborn, headstrong nature, but at the same time, nobody wanted to have this trip mean nothing.

“Look, we did come all this way. Let’s just get rid of the body and get out of here.”

That was the most level-headed and down-to-earth response I had ever heard leave Markov’s mouth. His words earned an approving nod from Valgavoth who turned the keys in the ignition to start the van up.

“Now we’re talking. Let’s make this fast, I want to make it to our destination by sunrise so we can get some proper rest.”

The engine purred unevenly as we stepped out into the cold once more, the snowfall and wind biting through our clothes.

Up close, the body looked monstrous in a way I hadn’t noticed before. I tried not to think about it or so much as make eye contact with the body as we lifted and dragged it toward the rail. My boots slipped on the ice, forcing my breath to come out in a burst of panic.

“It’s okay,” Ishkanah whispered quietly, just barely audible above the crunch of the snow. “You’re okay.”

N’gath and Markov nodded in agreement as Valgavoth kept his focus and grip on the body. Her reassurance helped me steady myself as best as I could to complete the task at hand. None of us spoke a word as we approached a narrow turnout where the guardrail bent inward. The area in that spot dropped away into nothing but darkness, and that’s where we decided to dispose of the body.

Together, as one, we heaved. When we went to let go, the coat from the body nearly got caught on the metal rail causing the fabric to snag against the long-rusted bolts. With a united shove from all of us however, the body tipped, rolled, and vanished over the edge.

I’m not entirely sure how long we stood there, but I know it was longer than we should have. We expected to hear a scream, a thud, or something that confirmed gravity still worked the way it was supposed to. But we never heard anything aside from the vast, engulfing sound of silence and its aftermath.

Eventually Valgavoth muttered and broke the silence. “Let’s get back to the van.”

With that, we all walked back to the van, secured the back doors, and got settled in. Valgavoth pressed his foot down on the gas and we surged ahead into the night. 

A little while later, Ishkanah spoke, her voice barely audible above the whir of the engine. “Is this why the town was abandoned?”

Nobody cut through the stunned silence except for Valgavoth who didn’t even bother looking at her.

“No,” he said immediately. “And don’t say that again.”

That was the last time any of us decided to speak.

I’m writing this as we continue toward the chapel, too anxious to feel how exhausted my body must be feeling right now as I’m pressed against the equipment. No one has spoken since we got back on the road, and I don’t think anyone plans to. 

I keep watching the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following us through the snow, but the road behind us is empty from what I can tell. 

A part of me knows we should turn back, that whatever we threw over that guardrail was an omen, but this trip is everything we’ve worked toward, and no one is willing to be the first to say that fear meant more than our dreams. 

If something else happens, I’ll give an update. If I don’t, then understand that nothing stopped us from turning back.

1qbc6io,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1qbc6io/i_went_to_record_a_demo_with_my_black_metal_band/,"I Went to Record a Demo With My Black Metal Band in the Mountains, But Something Attacked Us on the Road","Hello everyone. I’m not really sure if this is the right place to explain my story, but I don’t really know if a right place even exists. I’m not exactly sure what we encountered, but I want others to know about it. Let me explain everything from the beginning.

My band isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination, at least not in the mainstream. We formed in the winter of 2019 in a small, snowy town in Colorado and built up our reputation for years in the Black Metal underground scene.

Our band quickly achieved notoriety for our haunting music, intense live shows, and intimidating aesthetic that was a byproduct of making raw, unpolished music.

Last year, we recorded the entirety of our first demo, \\\*Buried in Impenetrable Darkness\\\*, on a battered to hell tape deck. We borrowed it from our vocalist’s dad and wedged it between old paint cans and a toolbox in the garage we were rehearsing in at the time.

Every take that we captured and played back made us realize that we had stumbled onto the exact atmosphere we had been striving to achieve since day one. The songs sounded like they had been excavated from a collapsed mineshaft, akin to Darkthrone’s \\\*Transylvanian Hunger\\\*.

It became the kind of demo that was traded heavily, and rumors spread that the music had been recorded deep inside an abandoned crypt. We never corrected people; we just let the myth become a part of the legacy as much as the music.

Before I go any further, I should explain something. We never use our real names in the band. That’s normal in the Black Metal genre. The scene has always been built on personas and the mythos behind them. You don’t join a band like ours to be “Eric” or “Devin” anymore. You take on a name that sounds like it emerged from the foggiest graveyard. Pseudonyms in this genre aren’t just armor, they’re equal parts secrecy, legend, and ritual.

My bandmates and I chose names that belonged carved into an ossuary wall rather than printed on a driver’s license. That’s how I became Ulalek, and how the rest of the band became N’gath, Ishkanah, Valgavoth, and Lord Markov.

N’gath towered over the rest of us like some giant, starving medieval saint who was all elbows and cheekbones. His arms looked like they belonged on a marionette, and the corpse-paint tattooed on them was self-inflicted with a stick-and-poke rig he had designed himself after listening to nothing but the Norwegian music scene for months. He possessed the seriousness of a monk, but also the theatrics of a guy who could summon malicious spirits. N’gath rarely spoke offstage, but when he did, his voice was surprisingly gentle, like he was determined to make every word of his count.

Then there was Ishkanah, our lead guitarist. She was someone who looked like she had crawled out of a mossy hollow but also maintained perfect eyeliner. The forest-witch vibe wasn’t just for show; she was devoted to that lifestyle. She collected and stored bones as “art projects”, obsessed over botany, and exclusively drank nothing but her herbal teas. Beneath that mystical exterior though, was someone whose nervous system was in constant overdrive.

Valgavoth, the smartass of the group, was the one who wielded the bass guitar. He was barrel-chested and sported long, raven-black hair that looked freshly conditioned even though he insisted he washed it only in “mountain rain”. His eyes were always hidden behind sunglasses to “avoid the gaze of God”. Whatever the hell that meant. Despite his flaws, he was the glue that held us together. When rehearsals got ugly, he could shut everyone up with one raised eyebrow behind his shades.

Our drummer Lord Markov didn’t just play the drums; he attacked them like they owed him money. Everything about him was loud: his laugh, his personality, his snare hits. He was notorious for throwing his whole body into every story he told, but for all his chaos, Markov was a genuine soul.

We were a mess, but we were a family, and a perpetually broke one at that. There’s only so much money you can make in music, let alone metal.

As passionate as we were, it wasn’t paying the bills. Eventually, after slaving away at our day jobs, we managed to save up enough money to fund production for our first album. It seemed like a big break, but our savings were essentially pissed away in an instant when the engineer we hired to oversee our production ghosted us the day before our recording session.

We were gutted and didn’t have the faintest clue of what to do. The money that we had was gone, the piece of shit took our money and ran.

When all seemed lost, N’gath found a place he thought we should go record at. He told us when rehearsals had devolved into Markov pounding on the drums in frustration and Ishkanah spiraling about “rhythmic entropy curves”.

Valgavoth and I were frustrated and wondering where N’gath went when he drifted in from the hallway like a wraith returning from a pilgrimage. He held his phone with both hands, treating it like it were some coveted relic. Valgavoth gave him a questionable look, prompting him to clear his throat.

He didn’t announce what he had to say; instead, he whispered, “I have found… something,”

Markov stopped mid-drumstick twirl and glared. “If this is another one of your “haunted” locations, I’m out,”

“It’s not a “haunted” location, Markov,” N’gath spoke, his voice calm but papery. “It’s a chapel.”

Ishkanah snapped her head up, pupils way too dilated for someone who claimed she’d “only had two coffees.” “A chapel?” she inquired. “Like… with acoustics? Or with spirits? Or with both? Holy architecture has resonance lines, you know. Some frequencies can—”

Valgavoth, still wearing his perpetual indoor sunglasses, put up a hand. “Before Google here goes on another tangent… what’s so special about this chapel of yours? Why should we give a shit about this place?”

N’gath turned the screen around to show a crumbling stone building perched on the edge of a cliff. Snow had swallowed the trees around it, but it was as haunting as it was beautiful. “It’s in the San Juans. The chapel was built in the 1890s and rumor has it that it was meant for monks who live in the mountains there. It has since been abandoned for reasons unknown. Others say they left because they heard and saw… things.”

“Perfect! Let’s go record there and terrorize whatever’s in the mountains along the way! We could get some cool ghost stories out of this.” Markov smiled the kind of smile that meant he was already packing in his head.

“Guys, shouldn’t we think about this? The mountains? That’s a tall ask of us.” I said, trying to talk some sense into my bandmates.

N’gath continued, ignoring Markov and I. “The article said that the acoustics there are flawless and can make harmonies echo for minutes at a time.” He paused, his voice dipping lower. “It would make us sound like we were conjuring something evil and powerful. Our music will finally have teeth.”

Ishkanah shivered with excitement. “Teeth have a frequency you know. You can hear the tension in enamel if the room’s quiet enough.”

“I swear to God, Ish, sometimes I think you’re just making up words.” Valgavoth shot her a side-eye behind the sunglasses before turning back to N’gath. “So, are we taking a field trip there? We’re just going to Magic School Bus our asses and our gear up a mountain and hope we survive the elements? Great plan Einstein. What if the building collapses on us?”

“What if we don’t make it and we’re stranded up there? What then? I want this as badly as you guys, but I don’t think that the potential payoff is worth the risk.” I voiced my concerns, much to the dismay of Valgavoth.

“Sometimes in life, you have to be willing to risk everything. That’s what being in a band is about.”

N’gath put his phone into his pocket and crossed his arms against his chest. “There is nothing to worry about guys. The route to get there is safe, and the chapel is still structurally sound according to my research.”

“Oh, well if an article said it, then clearly it must be true.” Valgavoth spoke dryly.

Markov slammed his sticks together like a declaration of war. “I’m in! If the mountain wants to fight us, let it. A little snow and ice never scared me! Mom didn’t raise no bitch! I’ll drum on its corpse.”

Valgavoth sighed like a disappointed father before replying, “You can’t drum on a mountain’s corpse you dumbass,”

Markov shot a dirty look at Valgavoth as he twirled his drumsticks idly.

Ishkanah bounced on her toes in a jittery kinetic blur. “We should test the acoustics with dissonant triads! Or drop-tuned tremolo lines! Or—”

“Lovely,” Valgavoth interrupted. “We’ll die and it’ll be because we annoyed the shit out of a spirit with jazz chords.”

“This could be the breakthrough,” N’gath exhaled slowly.

“N’gath could be right.” I spoke after sitting on the idea for a moment. “This could be our breakthrough moment. We could finally capture that sound we’ve been looking for at this place.”

For a few seconds after I said that, the room went dead silent. Nobody said anything as everyone thought the situation over in their heads. None of us wanted to admit that we were desperate, but we were. Months of hard work were wasted, and our dreams were hanging on to the hopes that we were impulsive enough to make them a reality.

Seeing everyone so passionate and alive made me have a change of heart about my concerns. Looking at everyone’s faces, I could tell the others felt the same, strange mix of dread and excitement when you’re about to do something profoundly stupid but possibly life-changing.

N’gath just stood there, hands folded in his sleeves like some gaunt prophet as we all nodded one by one. With no second thoughts, the five of us agreed to drive straight into the mountains with nothing but our gear, worse judgment, and corpse paint.

We packed everything we needed shortly afterward and began taking everything to the shitty white van we owned. As we loaded up the last of the equipment into the van, Valgavoth slid his sunglasses down his nose, and said, “If this thing breaks down on a mountain road and we get eaten by whatever cryptid is trending this month, I’m blaming all of you.”

N’gath didn’t say anything at first. He just placed his microphone gently on top of one of Ishkanah’s amps, like he was tucking a child into bed. Then, softly:

“The spirits of the mountain will guide us.”

“Are the spirits a more reliable guide than Mapquest, N’gath?” Valgavoth rolled his eyes and climbed into the passenger seat.

Ishkanah buckled herself in, eyes wide and bright like she hadn’t slept in three days. “Actually, mountains have specific harmonic signatures—”

“NOPE,” Markov shouted from the back before she could get started. “Not listening to your ramblings again. Last time, I lost a whole weekend.”

N’gath climbed into the driver’s seat as I sat next to Ishkanah, laughing at Markov’s gripes with her. I had barely fastened my seatbelt before the van growled to life, and we rumbled out of the city.

The van shuddered as it drove down the road, as snow gathered on the edges of the highway in jagged, messy piles. Somewhere between the mile markers, I watched the sky turn a bruise-purple and listened to the engine screech like a dying animal.

Ishkanah just stared out the window, her voice was unsettlingly calm as she spoke to no one in particular. “They left because they heard and saw things…what was meant by that exactly?”

Valgavoth slowly shook his head in awkward disapproval. “Ish, why are you like this? Haven’t you ever heard of folklore or superstitions?”

“From what I read, the town was evacuated and left abandoned due to a monster.” N’gath whispered, almost to himself. Before I could speak up, I noticed a recognizable golden arch.

“Pull into that McDonald’s N’gath. I want a goddamn McRib.” Valgavoth pointed at the McDonald’s sign like it was salvation, only for us to discover the building was completely dark. There was not a single soul in the parking lot and the drive-thru menu hung half off its metal frame.

He cursed under his breath for a full minute before muttering that the universe was “a tasteless bitch.” We all laughed hysterically at his bitterness, our laughter thinning out as we ascended higher into the mountains.

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, but I remember waking to the sound of \\\*Beyond the Great Vast Forest\\\* by Emperor dissolving into static as our radio lost its signal. I looked out the passenger window to see that the roadside houses I’d been watching earlier had disappeared entirely into the darkness.

Beyond the narrow cone of light from our dim headlights was but pitch-black pressing in. Snow whipped sideways, causing the asphalt from the road to be swallowed in places that erased the center line of the road entirely. The van hummed unevenly beneath us as the engine strained against the incline, causing the enclosed space to vibrate loudly.

Valgavoth muttered something about the radio being garbage under his breath and reached for the dial to fix the signal.

For a while, the only sounds were the engine’s labored whine and the rhythmic slap of snow against the windows. Every sweep of the windshield wipers smeared the world back into white noise.

There were no signs of life other than the occasional reflective marker flashing and vanishing at the edge of the beams of our headlights. I found myself counting the seconds as I looked out the window, staring out at nothing.

Suddenly, a heavy thud detonated against the passenger side. The metal of the vehicle boomed and I was driven hard into the door due to the impact, causing the breath to be punched clean out of my lungs. White sparks burst across my vision as N’gath fought the wheel. The van swerved violently across the narrow road toward the snow-choked shoulder before N’gath was able to stabilize the vehicle and snap us back onto the road.

Markov sat up in his seat having been woken up by the impact of whatever we had collided with. “What the hell was that?”

Before anyone could answer, an agonizingly slow, metallic scrape noise pierced the air.

I turned my head to look outside my window, just in time to see a shape dart across the outside of our vehicle. I didn’t get a clear look, but before I could let anyone know about what I had seen, Ishkanah screamed.

The roof dented inward and snow slid down the windshield in sheets from the weight pressing down above us.

“There’s someone on the van!” I cried out as another violent jolt rocked us forward.

“Hold on everyone!” N’gath declared through clenched teeth as he jerked the wheel hard to the left, causing us to fishtail. The tires screamed against the ice, the sudden force ripping the shape free from above.

A sickening thud echoed through the still, night air as the body disappeared into the snowbank and the van came to a screeching halt several yards down the road. N’gath cut the engine and we sat in complete silence for what felt like an eternity trying to process what had just happened.

Markov was the first to speak, his words being the ones to articulate what everyone else was afraid to speak into existence.

“I think…I think that was a guy.”

My stomach plummeted at the realization. We sat there in the freezing cold of the darkness, our breath fogging the windows as we listened for movement outside.

“We can’t just leave him,” Ishkanah pleaded in a whisper. “If we…if we killed someone—”

“WE…didn’t kill anybody. Got that?” Valgavoth turned in his seat to address us. “We’re going to pretend this didn’t happen and we’re going to drive away from here.”

“Are you fucking mental? We just hit a person and you want us to leave the scene of a crime?!” I cried out in anger as I reached for my door handle.

“We’re in the middle of fucking nowhere in the mountains Sherlock. Who is going to know? Besides, we were attacked first. We could just say it was in self-defense. The bastard was practically asking for this anyways.”

Against my better judgment, I opened the door and felt the cold sting my face.

“Where are you going?” Markov asked as I unbuckled myself and stepped foot onto the snow-covered road outside.

“To do the right thing.”

No one moved at first. The only sound in the deafening quiet was the snow that continued to fall in thick sheets around the van. I half expected someone to argue or to tell me it was a bad idea, but guilt has a way of settling things faster than logic ever could. One by one, the hinges of the doors squeaked open, and seconds later, the sound of boots crunching in the snow could be heard following me.

The darkness engulfed everything but the weak, yellow glow of our headlights as we made our way through the snow and into the treeline. My heart pounded harder with every step as the skid marks and churned powder morphed into dark smears until we approached the limp body at the end of the trail.

“Jesus,” Markov whispered, his breath lingered in the air in a pale, trembling mist. “We killed him.”

I took another step closer, my boots crunching softly against the frozen terrain. Up close, something was off in a way I couldn’t articulate at the time. His clothes consisted of an old-fashioned dark coat and boots with no tread that were buried beneath the snow. The man’s chest didn’t rise, but I thought I saw the fingers of the arm twisted beneath him twitch.

“Guys, I think I saw movement.” I stated aloud as I approached and felt the ice-cold temperature of his hand against mine.

“We need to get him to a hospital!” Ishkanah declared as she crouched beside me to inspect the body.

Valgavoth rolled his eyes in annoyance. “We’re not taking him anywhere. He’s dead. End of story. Now let’s get back into the van before we freeze to death out here.”

Before we could even acknowledge Valgavoth’s comment, the man’s eyes shot open. His pitch-black pupils reflected the van’s headlights before locking onto me.

I didn’t have time to react.

One moment he was in a crumbled heap in the snow, and the next he was airborne with the sudden and complete awareness of a predator.

The man tackled me and sent me sprawling backward hard enough to drive the air from my lungs in a panicked gasp. I screamed in terror as the man’s hands clamped down on both of my shoulders. His mouth ripped and tore at my hands as I raised them defensively on instinct.

The demented and choked growling sound the man made didn’t sound like anything I had ever heard. It sounded ancient, primal, and most terrifying of all, hungry. His teeth scraped against the flesh of my hands, causing light drops of blood to fall onto my clothes.

Ishkanah lunged forward instinctively, her fingers closing around my arm to pull me away, but the man reacted without turning to her. He struck her with one arm; the force sent her tumbling into the snow several feet away. She hit the ground hard, and her body let out a weak groan as she struggled to sit up.

“RUN!” Valgavoth shouted, his voice cracking as he rushed towards Ishkanah to drag her to safety while N’gath and Markov came to my aid.

Markov grabbed a nearby rock and launched it at the man’s head to seemingly no effect. N’gath found a decently sized tree branch on the ground and started whacking the man over the head with it in an effort to get him off of me.

After several sick thuds to the skull, the man lifted his head slowly. It was in that moment that we noticed that he wasn’t a man at all. He was something else entirely.

His mouth was dripping wet with saliva as he flashed his teeth and turned toward N’gath and Markov. I knew I had a small window of opportunity in that moment, so I took advantage of the distraction and pushed the man off me.

I began running back to the van with the others, turning back once to see the frenzied gaze in the man’s eyes as we sprinted. The bitter cold tore at my legs and my lungs felt like they were on fire as we got closer to the van.

Behind us, we heard a shrill scream echo as the man continued his pursuit. The headlights in the distance signaled safety as Valgavoth and Ishkanah were the first to reach the van.

Valgavoth helped Ishkanah get inside and yanked the driver’s side door open just as the rest of us were able to pile inside in a blind panic. Not even a moment later, the man slammed into the side of the vehicle, causing the entire van to shake. The metal groaned from the impact, the van nearly tipping over on its side.

“GO!” Markov yelled with urgency as Valgavoth turned to N’gath.

“GIMME THE FUCKING KEYS!!!”

N’gath frantically searched his pockets and tossed them to Valgavoth. Outside, there was another screech and another thud that made the van slide a few feet across the road. Valgavoth turned the keys in the ignition, and floored it out of there.

The van jerked forward violently as we took off, but we were not alone. The man clung to the rear door and punched through the steel with his long, pale fingers. Under the immense pressure and strength of our attacker, the doors buckled and the metal began being ripped apart like paper.

“If he tears the doors open, we’re going to lose our equipment!” Markov shouted as he looked to Valgavoth for ideas.

Valgavoth never took his eyes off the road. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting from me, I’m the one driving!”

That’s when N’gath chimed in. “Ulalek, unlock the door and see if you can knock him off somehow.”

“Have you lost your goddamn mind?!” I protested. “How do you expect me to get this dude off our van?”

“FIGURE IT OUT!” Valgavoth jerked the wheel again, harder this time. The van’s tires screeched as we narrowly avoided contact with the guardrail. Whoever, or rather, whatever was clinging to the back barely reacted. A hand punched near the door handle, causing its fingers to curl inward.

Markov let out a laugh that was halfway between hysteria and shock. “Yeah, easy for you to say that while we’re being peeled open like a fucking can of Campbell’s.”

“STOP ARGUING,” Ishkanah snapped from her seat, where she was bracing herself against an amp.

I stared at the side door handle, as my heart pounded so hard it started to blur my vision. The metal surrounding the rear doors bowed inward again, and snow blasted through the holes in harsh, stinging bursts.

N’gath didn’t raise his voice, but instead remained calm as ever somehow. “You do not need to fight it, you only need to distract it.”

The van hit a bump and I slammed shoulder-first into the side of the vehicle. From outside, we could hear an excited scream echo as one of its hands disappeared through the door entirely. It dragged its fingers blindly along the interior metal as Valgavoth glanced in the rearview mirror at the sheer carnage unfolding.

“We’re running out of van!” He yelled before turning his attention back to the road, hands firmly planted on the steering wheel.

“No shit man!” I heard Markov scream as I unlocked the side door before I could second guess my decision. The moment the latch clicked, the door rattled violently and caved inward slightly. I hastily slid the door open, and in a blinding white rush, the icy wind bombarded the interior.

I shuddered as I gripped the door, watching the road pass by in a blur below. I looked to my left and right, and it was on the right-hand side of the van that I could make out the man clinging sideways to the rear. Like a Spider clinging to a wall, gravity seemed to not have any effect on him in the slightest.

With unsettling ease, the joints in his body flexed and adjusted with every jolt from our vehicle navigating the road. His knuckles were bloody and worn from the repeated seams and dents it left in the van.

“What the fuck is going on out there?” Markov asked as he and Ishkanah watched me from inside.

I didn’t think about my next move, I just grabbed the first thing my hand found and held onto it like a lifeline. The mic stand I gripped was slick with the condensation from the palms of my sweaty, bleeding hands. I trembled at the wind tearing at me through the open door but braved the elements enough to slowly lean outside.

The van rocked abruptly and nearly threw me out, causing me to instinctively grab onto the door and catch my balance. The thing clinging to the rear noticed my stumble and crawled across the metal towards me. Then, in an attempt to keep him at bay, I swung.

The metallic clang from the mic stand rang out on impact with its body and sent a rattling sensation through my arms. Its grip faltered and it shrieked with pain, but it didn’t let go. He hung there with his boots skidding uselessly against the bumper, scrabbling for purchase. With an outstretched arm, he turned toward me, and his blackened eyes locked onto mine.

I tried to pull back and get the door shut as quickly as possible, but it lunged anyway. His mouth opened so wide that I could see his serrated teeth.

As the gap between us closed, the van swerved, causing me to stagger and reflexively throw the mic stand up between us. I closed my eyes and felt an abrupt jolt, followed by a sickly thud and the sound of wheezing.

I opened my eyes to find his face pressed close to mine with the mic stand buried through his chest at an angle I hadn’t anticipated. Blood slid down the metal pole in slow, crimson drops that felt eerily warm against my hands. His breath washed over my face, smelling like rancid meat as it shuddered and gasped for life. All I could think in that moment was that I hadn’t meant to do that, I only wanted to make everything stop.

“DUDE YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Markov exclaimed as Ishkanah looked like she was trying her best to refrain from puking.

“You killed him?” N’gath asked as he turned around to see for himself.

“I’m putting this thing in park.” Valgavoth stated coldly as he gently pressed on the brakes and a few moments later, the van had come to a stop next to the guardrail.

I let go of the mic stand and watched the lifeless body whose blood covered my hands fall to the ground outside. I tossed the bloody, bent mic stand into the snow before N’gath could get a good look at it. For a while, the only sounds that could be heard were our ragged breathing, and the drip… drip… drip of gasoline leaking somewhere beneath us.

After what felt like eons, Ishkanah whispered the question that was on everybody’s minds. ”What do we do now?”

I swallowed the bile that had accumulated in my throat. “I’m not sure.”

“Like I told y’all earlier,” Valgavoth said. “We get rid of the body and pretend that none of this ever happened. Had everyone just listened to me we wouldn’t have ended up in this mess.”

“We can’t just pretend we’re safe here, we need to go back home. It’s too dangerous.” I looked at everyone in hopes that they would side with me.

He shook his head in frustration before slamming his hands down on the steering wheel. “In case you’ve forgotten jackass, we have traveled a long way to go to this place that N’gath INSISTED was the perfect place for recording our album. I’m not going to turn around just because some bozo doped up on ketamine or whatever thought that attacking our van in the middle of the night was peak entertainment.”

“He nearly killed us back there! You and I both know that he…he wasn’t human…  ” I explained before drifting off, afraid to finish my thought.

“Oh don’t tell me that you actually believe that this guy is what you’re trying to imply he is.” Valgavoth scoffed. “If you believe that then you’re a bigger dumbass than I thought.”

“No one here is a dumbass.” N’gath replied.

“Let’s just…move past this and work together as a group.” Ishkanah stated, still gripping to the loose equipment tightly as if any moment they could fall out.

“There is no moving past this, we leave now.” I insisted as I tried to reach for the keys in the ignition.

“You’re right, we leave now, but we’re not turning around.” Valgavoth swatted my hand away before I could touch the keys. “Newsflash, I’m the one behind the wheel so I’m in charge. I didn’t just nearly lose my life going up a mountain from your average meth head hanging around a 7/11 to not record this album. Now you guys can either join me or get the fuck out of this van and y’all can party it up out here in the tundra.”

An uncomfortable quiet overtook the van as everyone sat and pondered the next course of action. Nobody wanted to challenge Valgavoth’s stubborn, headstrong nature, but at the same time, nobody wanted to have this trip mean nothing.

“Look, we did come all this way. Let’s just get rid of the body and get out of here.”

That was the most level-headed and down-to-earth response I had ever heard leave Markov’s mouth. His words earned an approving nod from Valgavoth who turned the keys in the ignition to start the van up.

“Now we’re talking. Let’s make this fast, I want to make it to our destination by sunrise so we can get some proper rest.”

The engine purred unevenly as we stepped out into the cold once more, the snowfall and wind biting through our clothes.

Up close, the body looked monstrous in a way I hadn’t noticed before. I tried not to think about it or so much as make eye contact with the body as we lifted and dragged it toward the rail. My boots slipped on the ice, forcing my breath to come out in a burst of panic.

“It’s okay,” Ishkanah whispered quietly, just barely audible above the crunch of the snow. “You’re okay.”

N’gath and Markov nodded in agreement as Valgavoth kept his focus and grip on the body. Her reassurance helped me steady myself as best as I could to complete the task at hand. None of us spoke a word as we approached a narrow turnout where the guardrail bent inward. The area in that spot dropped away into nothing but darkness, and that’s where we decided to dispose of the body.

Together, as one, we heaved. When we went to let go, the coat from the body nearly got caught on the metal rail causing the fabric to snag against the long-rusted bolts. With a united shove from all of us however, the body tipped, rolled, and vanished over the edge.

I’m not entirely sure how long we stood there, but I know it was longer than we should have. We expected to hear a scream, a thud, or something that confirmed gravity still worked the way it was supposed to. But we never heard anything aside from the vast, engulfing sound of silence and its aftermath.

Eventually Valgavoth muttered and broke the silence. “Let’s get back to the van.”

With that, we all walked back to the van, secured the back doors, and got settled in. Valgavoth pressed his foot down on the gas and we surged ahead into the night.

A little while later, Ishkanah spoke, her voice barely audible above the whir of the engine. “Is this why the town was abandoned?”

Nobody cut through the stunned silence except for Valgavoth who didn’t even bother looking at her.

“No,” he said immediately. “And don’t say that again.”

That was the last time any of us decided to speak.

I’m writing this as we continue toward the chapel, too anxious to feel how exhausted my body must be feeling right now as I’m pressed against the equipment. No one has spoken since we got back on the road, and I don’t think anyone plans to.

I keep watching the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following us through the snow, but the road behind us is empty from what I can tell.

A part of me knows we should turn back, that whatever we threw over that guardrail was an omen, but this trip is everything we’ve worked toward, and no one is willing to be the first to say that fear meant more than our dreams.

If something else happens, I’ll give an update. If I don’t, then understand that nothing stopped us from turning back.

🇵🇷…I had a terrible experience at Pizza Piola. When we got to the counter the staff did not acknowledge us for a while as they spoke Spanish and laughed with each other. We paid for our food and sat down in the bar area hoping to get margaritas. The staff brought us our food in togo containers and the man stood at the door of the bar area in front of other customers and told us “you can’t eat here”. We were told we had to leave and it was in an aggressive manner in which other customers laughed at us. They said the excuse was “you ordered take out” however we never said that and the staff never asked. I will be going the legal route but I wanted to ask:

We are tourists, we are veterans, we are black, and speak little Spanish and I’m just curious why we were treated so badly. Are any of those characteristics something Puerto Ricans don’t like? We have met both nice and rude people here but I’ve never been treated like that at an establishment before. What am I missing??",0,1768263435.0,PuertoRico,11,0.5,False

1qbc5pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qbc5pm/hr_i_went_to_record_a_demo_with_my_black_metal/,"[HR] I Went to Record a Demo With My Black Metal Band in the Mountains, But Something Attacked Us on the Road.","Hello everyone. I’m not really sure if this is the right place to explain my story, but I don’t really know if a right place even exists. I’m not exactly sure what we encountered, but I want others to know about it. Let me explain everything from the beginning.

My band isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination, at least not in the mainstream. We formed in the winter of 2019 in a small, snowy town in Colorado and built up our reputation for years in the Black Metal underground scene. 

Our band quickly achieved notoriety for our haunting music, intense live shows, and intimidating aesthetic that was a byproduct of making raw, unpolished music.

Last year, we recorded the entirety of our first demo, \\\*Buried in Impenetrable Darkness\\\*, on a battered to hell tape deck. We borrowed it from our vocalist’s dad and wedged it between old paint cans and a toolbox in the garage we were rehearsing in at the time. 

Every take that we captured and played back made us realize that we had stumbled onto the exact atmosphere we had been striving to achieve since day one. The songs sounded like they had been excavated from a collapsed mineshaft, akin to Darkthrone’s \\\*Transylvanian Hunger\\\*. 

It became the kind of demo that was traded heavily, and rumors spread that the music had been recorded deep inside an abandoned crypt. We never corrected people; we just let the myth become a part of the legacy as much as the music.

Before I go any further, I should explain something. We never use our real names in the band. That’s normal in the Black Metal genre. The scene has always been built on personas and the mythos behind them. You don’t join a band like ours to be “Eric” or “Devin” anymore. You take on a name that sounds like it emerged from the foggiest graveyard. Pseudonyms in this genre aren’t just armor, they’re equal parts secrecy, legend, and ritual. 

My bandmates and I chose names that belonged carved into an ossuary wall rather than printed on a driver’s license. That’s how I became Ulalek, and how the rest of the band became N’gath, Ishkanah, Valgavoth, and Lord Markov.

N’gath towered over the rest of us like some giant, starving medieval saint who was all elbows and cheekbones. His arms looked like they belonged on a marionette, and the corpse-paint tattooed on them was self-inflicted with a stick-and-poke rig he had designed himself after listening to nothing but the Norwegian music scene for months. He possessed the seriousness of a monk, but also the theatrics of a guy who could summon malicious spirits. N’gath rarely spoke offstage, but when he did, his voice was surprisingly gentle, like he was determined to make every word of his count.

Then there was Ishkanah, our lead guitarist. She was someone who looked like she had crawled out of a mossy hollow but also maintained perfect eyeliner. The forest-witch vibe wasn’t just for show; she was devoted to that lifestyle. She collected and stored bones as “art projects”, obsessed over botany, and exclusively drank nothing but her herbal teas. Beneath that mystical exterior though, was someone whose nervous system was in constant overdrive. 

Valgavoth, the smartass of the group, was the one who wielded the bass guitar. He was barrel-chested and sported long, raven-black hair that looked freshly conditioned even though he insisted he washed it only in “mountain rain”. His eyes were always hidden behind sunglasses to “avoid the gaze of God”. Whatever the hell that meant. Despite his flaws, he was the glue that held us together. When rehearsals got ugly, he could shut everyone up with one raised eyebrow behind his shades.

Our drummer Lord Markov didn’t just play the drums; he attacked them like they owed him money. Everything about him was loud: his laugh, his personality, his snare hits. He was notorious for throwing his whole body into every story he told, but for all his chaos, Markov was a genuine soul. 

We were a mess, but we were a family, and a perpetually broke one at that. There’s only so much money you can make in music, let alone metal. 

As passionate as we were, it wasn’t paying the bills. Eventually, after slaving away at our day jobs, we managed to save up enough money to fund production for our first album. It seemed like a big break, but our savings were essentially pissed away in an instant when the engineer we hired to oversee our production ghosted us the day before our recording session. 

We were gutted and didn’t have the faintest clue of what to do. The money that we had was gone, the piece of shit took our money and ran. 

When all seemed lost, N’gath found a place he thought we should go record at. He told us when rehearsals had devolved into Markov pounding on the drums in frustration and Ishkanah spiraling about “rhythmic entropy curves”. 

Valgavoth and I were frustrated and wondering where N’gath went when he drifted in from the hallway like a wraith returning from a pilgrimage. He held his phone with both hands, treating it like it were some coveted relic. Valgavoth gave him a questionable look, prompting him to clear his throat.

He didn’t announce what he had to say; instead, he whispered, “I have found… something,”

Markov stopped mid-drumstick twirl and glared. “If this is another one of your “haunted” locations, I’m out,”

“It’s not a “haunted” location, Markov,” N’gath spoke, his voice calm but papery. “It’s a chapel.”

Ishkanah snapped her head up, pupils way too dilated for someone who claimed she’d “only had two coffees.” “A chapel?” she inquired. “Like… with acoustics? Or with spirits? Or with both? Holy architecture has resonance lines, you know. Some frequencies can—”

Valgavoth, still wearing his perpetual indoor sunglasses, put up a hand. “Before Google here goes on another tangent… what’s so special about this chapel of yours? Why should we give a shit about this place?”

N’gath turned the screen around to show a crumbling stone building perched on the edge of a cliff. Snow had swallowed the trees around it, but it was as haunting as it was beautiful. “It’s in the San Juans. The chapel was built in the 1890s and rumor has it that it was meant for monks who live in the mountains there. It has since been abandoned for reasons unknown. Others say they left because they heard and saw… things.”

“Perfect! Let’s go record there and terrorize whatever’s in the mountains along the way! We could get some cool ghost stories out of this.” Markov smiled the kind of smile that meant he was already packing in his head.

“Guys, shouldn’t we think about this? The mountains? That’s a tall ask of us.” I said, trying to talk some sense into my bandmates.

N’gath continued, ignoring Markov and I. “The article said that the acoustics there are flawless and can make harmonies echo for minutes at a time.” He paused, his voice dipping lower. “It would make us sound like we were conjuring something evil and powerful. Our music will finally have teeth.”

Ishkanah shivered with excitement. “Teeth have a frequency you know. You can hear the tension in enamel if the room’s quiet enough.”

“I swear to God, Ish, sometimes I think you’re just making up words.” Valgavoth shot her a side-eye behind the sunglasses before turning back to N’gath. “So, are we taking a field trip there? We’re just going to Magic School Bus our asses and our gear up a mountain and hope we survive the elements? Great plan Einstein. What if the building collapses on us?”

“What if we don’t make it and we’re stranded up there? What then? I want this as badly as you guys, but I don’t think that the potential payoff is worth the risk.” I voiced my concerns, much to the dismay of Valgavoth.

“Sometimes in life, you have to be willing to risk everything. That’s what being in a band is about.”

N’gath put his phone into his pocket and crossed his arms against his chest. “There is nothing to worry about guys. The route to get there is safe, and the chapel is still structurally sound according to my research.”

“Oh, well if an article said it, then clearly it must be true.” Valgavoth spoke dryly.

Markov slammed his sticks together like a declaration of war. “I’m in! If the mountain wants to fight us, let it. A little snow and ice never scared me! Mom didn’t raise no bitch! I’ll drum on its corpse.”

Valgavoth sighed like a disappointed father before replying, “You can’t drum on a mountain’s corpse you dumbass,”

Markov shot a dirty look at Valgavoth as he twirled his drumsticks idly. 

Ishkanah bounced on her toes in a jittery kinetic blur. “We should test the acoustics with dissonant triads! Or drop-tuned tremolo lines! Or—”

“Lovely,” Valgavoth interrupted. “We’ll die and it’ll be because we annoyed the shit out of a spirit with jazz chords.”

“This could be the breakthrough,” N’gath exhaled slowly. 

“N’gath could be right.” I spoke after sitting on the idea for a moment. “This could be our breakthrough moment. We could finally capture that sound we’ve been looking for at this place.”

For a few seconds after I said that, the room went dead silent. Nobody said anything as everyone thought the situation over in their heads. None of us wanted to admit that we were desperate, but we were. Months of hard work were wasted, and our dreams were hanging on to the hopes that we were impulsive enough to make them a reality.

Seeing everyone so passionate and alive made me have a change of heart about my concerns. Looking at everyone’s faces, I could tell the others felt the same, strange mix of dread and excitement when you’re about to do something profoundly stupid but possibly life-changing. 

N’gath just stood there, hands folded in his sleeves like some gaunt prophet as we all nodded one by one. With no second thoughts, the five of us agreed to drive straight into the mountains with nothing but our gear, worse judgment, and corpse paint.

We packed everything we needed shortly afterward and began taking everything to the shitty white van we owned. As we loaded up the last of the equipment into the van, Valgavoth slid his sunglasses down his nose, and said, “If this thing breaks down on a mountain road and we get eaten by whatever cryptid is trending this month, I’m blaming all of you.”

N’gath didn’t say anything at first. He just placed his microphone gently on top of one of Ishkanah’s amps, like he was tucking a child into bed. Then, softly:

“The spirits of the mountain will guide us.”

“Are the spirits a more reliable guide than Mapquest, N’gath?” Valgavoth rolled his eyes and climbed into the passenger seat.

Ishkanah buckled herself in, eyes wide and bright like she hadn’t slept in three days. “Actually, mountains have specific harmonic signatures—”

“NOPE,” Markov shouted from the back before she could get started. “Not listening to your ramblings again. Last time, I lost a whole weekend.”

N’gath climbed into the driver’s seat as I sat next to Ishkanah, laughing at Markov’s gripes with her. I had barely fastened my seatbelt before the van growled to life, and we rumbled out of the city. 

The van shuddered as it drove down the road, as snow gathered on the edges of the highway in jagged, messy piles. Somewhere between the mile markers, I watched the sky turn a bruise-purple and listened to the engine screech like a dying animal. 

Ishkanah just stared out the window, her voice was unsettlingly calm as she spoke to no one in particular. “They left because they heard and saw things…what was meant by that exactly?”

Valgavoth slowly shook his head in awkward disapproval. “Ish, why are you like this? Haven’t you ever heard of folklore or superstitions?”

“From what I read, the town was evacuated and left abandoned due to a monster.” N’gath whispered, almost to himself. Before I could speak up, I noticed a recognizable golden arch. 

“Pull into that McDonald’s N’gath. I want a goddamn McRib.” Valgavoth pointed at the McDonald’s sign like it was salvation, only for us to discover the building was completely dark. There was not a single soul in the parking lot and the drive-thru menu hung half off its metal frame. 

He cursed under his breath for a full minute before muttering that the universe was “a tasteless bitch.” We all laughed hysterically at his bitterness, our laughter thinning out as we ascended higher into the mountains. 

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, but I remember waking to the sound of \\\*Beyond the Great Vast Forest\\\* by Emperor dissolving into static as our radio lost its signal. I looked out the passenger window to see that the roadside houses I’d been watching earlier had disappeared entirely into the darkness. 

Beyond the narrow cone of light from our dim headlights was but pitch-black pressing in. Snow whipped sideways, causing the asphalt from the road to be swallowed in places that erased the center line of the road entirely. The van hummed unevenly beneath us as the engine strained against the incline, causing the enclosed space to vibrate loudly. 

Valgavoth muttered something about the radio being garbage under his breath and reached for the dial to fix the signal. 

For a while, the only sounds were the engine’s labored whine and the rhythmic slap of snow against the windows. Every sweep of the windshield wipers smeared the world back into white noise. 

There were no signs of life other than the occasional reflective marker flashing and vanishing at the edge of the beams of our headlights. I found myself counting the seconds as I looked out the window, staring out at nothing. 

Suddenly, a heavy thud detonated against the passenger side. The metal of the vehicle boomed and I was driven hard into the door due to the impact, causing the breath to be punched clean out of my lungs. White sparks burst across my vision as N’gath fought the wheel. The van swerved violently across the narrow road toward the snow-choked shoulder before N’gath was able to stabilize the vehicle and snap us back onto the road.

Markov sat up in his seat having been woken up by the impact of whatever we had collided with. “What the hell was that?”

Before anyone could answer, an agonizingly slow, metallic scrape noise pierced the air. 

I turned my head to look outside my window, just in time to see a shape dart across the outside of our vehicle. I didn’t get a clear look, but before I could let anyone know about what I had seen, Ishkanah screamed. 

The roof dented inward and snow slid down the windshield in sheets from the weight pressing down above us.

“There’s someone on the van!” I cried out as another violent jolt rocked us forward.

“Hold on everyone!” N’gath declared through clenched teeth as he jerked the wheel hard to the left, causing us to fishtail. The tires screamed against the ice, the sudden force ripping the shape free from above. 

A sickening thud echoed through the still, night air as the body disappeared into the snowbank and the van came to a screeching halt several yards down the road. N’gath cut the engine and we sat in complete silence for what felt like an eternity trying to process what had just happened. 

Markov was the first to speak, his words being the ones to articulate what everyone else was afraid to speak into existence.

“I think…I think that was a guy.”

My stomach plummeted at the realization. We sat there in the freezing cold of the darkness, our breath fogging the windows as we listened for movement outside.

“We can’t just leave him,” Ishkanah pleaded in a whisper. “If we…if we killed someone—”

“WE…didn’t kill anybody. Got that?” Valgavoth turned in his seat to address us. “We’re going to pretend this didn’t happen and we’re going to drive away from here.”

“Are you fucking mental? We just hit a person and you want us to leave the scene of a crime?!” I cried out in anger as I reached for my door handle.

“We’re in the middle of fucking nowhere in the mountains Sherlock. Who is going to know? Besides, we were attacked first. We could just say it was in self-defense. The bastard was practically asking for this anyways.” 

Against my better judgment, I opened the door and felt the cold sting my face.

“Where are you going?” Markov asked as I unbuckled myself and stepped foot onto the snow-covered road outside.

“To do the right thing.”

No one moved at first. The only sound in the deafening quiet was the snow that continued to fall in thick sheets around the van. I half expected someone to argue or to tell me it was a bad idea, but guilt has a way of settling things faster than logic ever could. One by one, the hinges of the doors squeaked open, and seconds later, the sound of boots crunching in the snow could be heard following me. 

The darkness engulfed everything but the weak, yellow glow of our headlights as we made our way through the snow and into the treeline. My heart pounded harder with every step as the skid marks and churned powder morphed into dark smears until we approached the limp body at the end of the trail. 

“Jesus,” Markov whispered, his breath lingered in the air in a pale, trembling mist. “We killed him.”

I took another step closer, my boots crunching softly against the frozen terrain. Up close, something was off in a way I couldn’t articulate at the time. His clothes consisted of an old-fashioned dark coat and boots with no tread that were buried beneath the snow. The man’s chest didn’t rise, but I thought I saw the fingers of the arm twisted beneath him twitch.

“Guys, I think I saw movement.” I stated aloud as I approached and felt the ice-cold temperature of his hand against mine.

“We need to get him to a hospital!” Ishkanah declared as she crouched beside me to inspect the body.

Valgavoth rolled his eyes in annoyance. “We’re not taking him anywhere. He’s dead. End of story. Now let’s get back into the van before we freeze to death out here.” 

Before we could even acknowledge Valgavoth’s comment, the man’s eyes shot open. His pitch-black pupils reflected the van’s headlights before locking onto me. 

I didn’t have time to react. 

One moment he was in a crumbled heap in the snow, and the next he was airborne with the sudden and complete awareness of a predator.

The man tackled me and sent me sprawling backward hard enough to drive the air from my lungs in a panicked gasp. I screamed in terror as the man’s hands clamped down on both of my shoulders. His mouth ripped and tore at my hands as I raised them defensively on instinct. 

The demented and choked growling sound the man made didn’t sound like anything I had ever heard. It sounded ancient, primal, and most terrifying of all, hungry. His teeth scraped against the flesh of my hands, causing light drops of blood to fall onto my clothes. 

Ishkanah lunged forward instinctively, her fingers closing around my arm to pull me away, but the man reacted without turning to her. He struck her with one arm; the force sent her tumbling into the snow several feet away. She hit the ground hard, and her body let out a weak groan as she struggled to sit up.

“RUN!” Valgavoth shouted, his voice cracking as he rushed towards Ishkanah to drag her to safety while N’gath and Markov came to my aid.

Markov grabbed a nearby rock and launched it at the man’s head to seemingly no effect. N’gath found a decently sized tree branch on the ground and started whacking the man over the head with it in an effort to get him off of me.

After several sick thuds to the skull, the man lifted his head slowly. It was in that moment that we noticed that he wasn’t a man at all. He was something else entirely.

His mouth was dripping wet with saliva as he flashed his teeth and turned toward N’gath and Markov. I knew I had a small window of opportunity in that moment, so I took advantage of the distraction and pushed the man off me. 

I began running back to the van with the others, turning back once to see the frenzied gaze in the man’s eyes as we sprinted. The bitter cold tore at my legs and my lungs felt like they were on fire as we got closer to the van. 

Behind us, we heard a shrill scream echo as the man continued his pursuit. The headlights in the distance signaled safety as Valgavoth and Ishkanah were the first to reach the van.

Valgavoth helped Ishkanah get inside and yanked the driver’s side door open just as the rest of us were able to pile inside in a blind panic. Not even a moment later, the man slammed into the side of the vehicle, causing the entire van to shake. The metal groaned from the impact, the van nearly tipping over on its side.

“GO!” Markov yelled with urgency as Valgavoth turned to N’gath.

“GIMME THE FUCKING KEYS!!!” 

N’gath frantically searched his pockets and tossed them to Valgavoth. Outside, there was another screech and another thud that made the van slide a few feet across the road. Valgavoth turned the keys in the ignition, and floored it out of there.

The van jerked forward violently as we took off, but we were not alone. The man clung to the rear door and punched through the steel with his long, pale fingers. Under the immense pressure and strength of our attacker, the doors buckled and the metal began being ripped apart like paper.

“If he tears the doors open, we’re going to lose our equipment!” Markov shouted as he looked to Valgavoth for ideas.

Valgavoth never took his eyes off the road. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting from me, I’m the one driving!”

That’s when N’gath chimed in. “Ulalek, unlock the door and see if you can knock him off somehow.”

“Have you lost your goddamn mind?!” I protested. “How do you expect me to get this dude off our van?”

“FIGURE IT OUT!” Valgavoth jerked the wheel again, harder this time. The van’s tires screeched as we narrowly avoided contact with the guardrail. Whoever, or rather, whatever was clinging to the back barely reacted. A hand punched near the door handle, causing its fingers to curl inward.

Markov let out a laugh that was halfway between hysteria and shock. “Yeah, easy for you to say that while we’re being peeled open like a fucking can of Campbell’s.”

“STOP ARGUING,” Ishkanah snapped from her seat, where she was bracing herself against an amp.

I stared at the side door handle, as my heart pounded so hard it started to blur my vision. The metal surrounding the rear doors bowed inward again, and snow blasted through the holes in harsh, stinging bursts.

N’gath didn’t raise his voice, but instead remained calm as ever somehow. “You do not need to fight it, you only need to distract it.”

The van hit a bump and I slammed shoulder-first into the side of the vehicle. From outside, we could hear an excited scream echo as one of its hands disappeared through the door entirely. It dragged its fingers blindly along the interior metal as Valgavoth glanced in the rearview mirror at the sheer carnage unfolding.

“We’re running out of van!” He yelled before turning his attention back to the road, hands firmly planted on the steering wheel.

“No shit man!” I heard Markov scream as I unlocked the side door before I could second guess my decision. The moment the latch clicked, the door rattled violently and caved inward slightly. I hastily slid the door open, and in a blinding white rush, the icy wind bombarded the interior. 

I shuddered as I gripped the door, watching the road pass by in a blur below. I looked to my left and right, and it was on the right-hand side of the van that I could make out the man clinging sideways to the rear. Like a Spider clinging to a wall, gravity seemed to not have any effect on him in the slightest. 

With unsettling ease, the joints in his body flexed and adjusted with every jolt from our vehicle navigating the road. His knuckles were bloody and worn from the repeated seams and dents it left in the van. 

“What the fuck is going on out there?” Markov asked as he and Ishkanah watched me from inside.

I didn’t think about my next move, I just grabbed the first thing my hand found and held onto it like a lifeline. The mic stand I gripped was slick with the condensation from the palms of my sweaty, bleeding hands. I trembled at the wind tearing at me through the open door but braved the elements enough to slowly lean outside. 

The van rocked abruptly and nearly threw me out, causing me to instinctively grab onto the door and catch my balance. The thing clinging to the rear noticed my stumble and crawled across the metal towards me. Then, in an attempt to keep him at bay, I swung.

The metallic clang from the mic stand rang out on impact with its body and sent a rattling sensation through my arms. Its grip faltered and it shrieked with pain, but it didn’t let go. He hung there with his boots skidding uselessly against the bumper, scrabbling for purchase. With an outstretched arm, he turned toward me, and his blackened eyes locked onto mine. 

I tried to pull back and get the door shut as quickly as possible, but it lunged anyway. His mouth opened so wide that I could see his serrated teeth. 

As the gap between us closed, the van swerved, causing me to stagger and reflexively throw the mic stand up between us. I closed my eyes and felt an abrupt jolt, followed by a sickly thud and the sound of wheezing.

I opened my eyes to find his face pressed close to mine with the mic stand buried through his chest at an angle I hadn’t anticipated. Blood slid down the metal pole in slow, crimson drops that felt eerily warm against my hands. His breath washed over my face, smelling like rancid meat as it shuddered and gasped for life. All I could think in that moment was that I hadn’t meant to do that, I only wanted to make everything stop.

“DUDE YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Markov exclaimed as Ishkanah looked like she was trying her best to refrain from puking.

“You killed him?” N’gath asked as he turned around to see for himself.

“I’m putting this thing in park.” Valgavoth stated coldly as he gently pressed on the brakes and a few moments later, the van had come to a stop next to the guardrail.

I let go of the mic stand and watched the lifeless body whose blood covered my hands fall to the ground outside. I tossed the bloody, bent mic stand into the snow before N’gath could get a good look at it. For a while, the only sounds that could be heard were our ragged breathing, and the drip… drip… drip of gasoline leaking somewhere beneath us.

After what felt like eons, Ishkanah whispered the question that was on everybody’s minds. ”What do we do now?”

I swallowed the bile that had accumulated in my throat. “I’m not sure.”

“Like I told y’all earlier,” Valgavoth said. “We get rid of the body and pretend that none of this ever happened. Had everyone just listened to me we wouldn’t have ended up in this mess.”

“We can’t just pretend we’re safe here, we need to go back home. It’s too dangerous.” I looked at everyone in hopes that they would side with me.

He shook his head in frustration before slamming his hands down on the steering wheel. “In case you’ve forgotten jackass, we have traveled a long way to go to this place that N’gath INSISTED was the perfect place for recording our album. I’m not going to turn around just because some bozo doped up on ketamine or whatever thought that attacking our van in the middle of the night was peak entertainment.”

“He nearly killed us back there! You and I both know that he…he wasn’t human…  ” I explained before drifting off, afraid to finish my thought.

“Oh don’t tell me that you actually believe that this guy is what you’re trying to imply he is.” Valgavoth scoffed. “If you believe that then you’re a bigger dumbass than I thought.”

“No one here is a dumbass.” N’gath replied.

“Let’s just…move past this and work together as a group.” Ishkanah stated, still gripping to the loose equipment tightly as if any moment they could fall out.

“There is no moving past this, we leave now.” I insisted as I tried to reach for the keys in the ignition.

“You’re right, we leave now, but we’re not turning around.” Valgavoth swatted my hand away before I could touch the keys. “Newsflash, I’m the one behind the wheel so I’m in charge. I didn’t just nearly lose my life going up a mountain from your average meth head hanging around a 7/11 to not record this album. Now you guys can either join me or get the fuck out of this van and y’all can party it up out here in the tundra.”

An uncomfortable quiet overtook the van as everyone sat and pondered the next course of action. Nobody wanted to challenge Valgavoth’s stubborn, headstrong nature, but at the same time, nobody wanted to have this trip mean nothing.

“Look, we did come all this way. Let’s just get rid of the body and get out of here.”

That was the most level-headed and down-to-earth response I had ever heard leave Markov’s mouth. His words earned an approving nod from Valgavoth who turned the keys in the ignition to start the van up.

“Now we’re talking. Let’s make this fast, I want to make it to our destination by sunrise so we can get some proper rest.”

The engine purred unevenly as we stepped out into the cold once more, the snowfall and wind biting through our clothes.

Up close, the body looked monstrous in a way I hadn’t noticed before. I tried not to think about it or so much as make eye contact with the body as we lifted and dragged it toward the rail. My boots slipped on the ice, forcing my breath to come out in a burst of panic.

“It’s okay,” Ishkanah whispered quietly, just barely audible above the crunch of the snow. “You’re okay.”

N’gath and Markov nodded in agreement as Valgavoth kept his focus and grip on the body. Her reassurance helped me steady myself as best as I could to complete the task at hand. None of us spoke a word as we approached a narrow turnout where the guardrail bent inward. The area in that spot dropped away into nothing but darkness, and that’s where we decided to dispose of the body.

Together, as one, we heaved. When we went to let go, the coat from the body nearly got caught on the metal rail causing the fabric to snag against the long-rusted bolts. With a united shove from all of us however, the body tipped, rolled, and vanished over the edge.

I’m not entirely sure how long we stood there, but I know it was longer than we should have. We expected to hear a scream, a thud, or something that confirmed gravity still worked the way it was supposed to. But we never heard anything aside from the vast, engulfing sound of silence and its aftermath.

Eventually Valgavoth muttered and broke the silence. “Let’s get back to the van.”

With that, we all walked back to the van, secured the back doors, and got settled in. Valgavoth pressed his foot down on the gas and we surged ahead into the night. 

A little while later, Ishkanah spoke, her voice barely audible above the whir of the engine. “Is this why the town was abandoned?”

Nobody cut through the stunned silence except for Valgavoth who didn’t even bother looking at her.

“No,” he said immediately. “And don’t say that again.”

That was the last time any of us decided to speak.

I’m writing this as we continue toward the chapel, too anxious to feel how exhausted my body must be feeling right now as I’m pressed against the equipment. No one has spoken since we got back on the road, and I don’t think anyone plans to. 

I keep watching the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following us through the snow, but the road behind us is empty from what I can tell. 

A part of me knows we should turn back, that whatever we threw over that guardrail was an omen, but this trip is everything we’ve worked toward, and no one is willing to be the first to say that fear meant more than our dreams. 

If something else happens, I’ll give an update. If I don’t, then understand that nothing stopped us from turning back.

I’m not really sure if this is the right place to explain my story, but I don’t really know if a right place even exists. I’m not exactly sure what we encountered, but I want others to know about it. Let me explain everything from the beginning.

My band isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination, at least not in the mainstream. We formed in the winter of 2019 in a small, snowy town in Colorado and built up our reputation for years in the Black Metal underground scene. 

Our band quickly achieved notoriety for our haunting music, intense live shows, and intimidating aesthetic that was a byproduct of making raw, unpolished music.

Last year, we recorded the entirety of our first demo, \\\*Buried in Impenetrable Darkness\\\*, on a battered to hell tape deck. We borrowed it from our vocalist’s dad and wedged it between old paint cans and a toolbox in the garage we were rehearsing in at the time. 

Every take that we captured and played back made us realize that we had stumbled onto the exact atmosphere we had been striving to achieve since day one. The songs sounded like they had been excavated from a collapsed mineshaft, akin to Darkthrone’s \\\*Transylvanian Hunger\\\*. 

It became the kind of demo that was traded heavily, and rumors spread that the music had been recorded deep inside an abandoned crypt. We never corrected people; we just let the myth become a part of the legacy as much as the music.

Before I go any further, I should explain something. We never use our real names in the band. That’s normal in the Black Metal genre. The scene has always been built on personas and the mythos behind them. You don’t join a band like ours to be “Eric” or “Devin” anymore. You take on a name that sounds like it emerged from the foggiest graveyard. Pseudonyms in this genre aren’t just armor, they’re equal parts secrecy, legend, and ritual. 

My bandmates and I chose names that belonged carved into an ossuary wall rather than printed on a driver’s license. That’s how I became Ulalek, and how the rest of the band became N’gath, Ishkanah, Valgavoth, and Lord Markov.

N’gath towered over the rest of us like some giant, starving medieval saint who was all elbows and cheekbones. His arms looked like they belonged on a marionette, and the corpse-paint tattooed on them was self-inflicted with a stick-and-poke rig he had designed himself after listening to nothing but the Norwegian music scene for months. He possessed the seriousness of a monk, but also the theatrics of a guy who could summon malicious spirits. N’gath rarely spoke offstage, but when he did, his voice was surprisingly gentle, like he was determined to make every word of his count.

Then there was Ishkanah, our lead guitarist. She was someone who looked like she had crawled out of a mossy hollow but also maintained perfect eyeliner. The forest-witch vibe wasn’t just for show; she was devoted to that lifestyle. She collected and stored bones as “art projects”, obsessed over botany, and exclusively drank nothing but her herbal teas. Beneath that mystical exterior though, was someone whose nervous system was in constant overdrive. 

Valgavoth, the smartass of the group, was the one who wielded the bass guitar. He was barrel-chested and sported long, raven-black hair that looked freshly conditioned even though he insisted he washed it only in “mountain rain”. His eyes were always hidden behind sunglasses to “avoid the gaze of God”. Whatever the hell that meant. Despite his flaws, he was the glue that held us together. When rehearsals got ugly, he could shut everyone up with one raised eyebrow behind his shades.

Our drummer Lord Markov didn’t just play the drums; he attacked them like they owed him money. Everything about him was loud: his laugh, his personality, his snare hits. He was notorious for throwing his whole body into every story he told, but for all his chaos, Markov was a genuine soul. 

We were a mess, but we were a family, and a perpetually broke one at that. There’s only so much money you can make in music, let alone metal. 

As passionate as we were, it wasn’t paying the bills. Eventually, after slaving away at our day jobs, we managed to save up enough money to fund production for our first album. It seemed like a big break, but our savings were essentially pissed away in an instant when the engineer we hired to oversee our production ghosted us the day before our recording session. 

We were gutted and didn’t have the faintest clue of what to do. The money that we had was gone, the piece of shit took our money and ran. 

When all seemed lost, N’gath found a place he thought we should go record at. He told us when rehearsals had devolved into Markov pounding on the drums in frustration and Ishkanah spiraling about “rhythmic entropy curves”. 

Valgavoth and I were frustrated and wondering where N’gath went when he drifted in from the hallway like a wraith returning from a pilgrimage. He held his phone with both hands, treating it like it were some coveted relic. Valgavoth gave him a questionable look, prompting him to clear his throat.

He didn’t announce what he had to say; instead, he whispered, “I have found… something,”

Markov stopped mid-drumstick twirl and glared. “If this is another one of your “haunted” locations, I’m out,”

“It’s not a “haunted” location, Markov,” N’gath spoke, his voice calm but papery. “It’s a chapel.”

Ishkanah snapped her head up, pupils way too dilated for someone who claimed she’d “only had two coffees.” “A chapel?” she inquired. “Like… with acoustics? Or with spirits? Or with both? Holy architecture has resonance lines, you know. Some frequencies can—”

Valgavoth, still wearing his perpetual indoor sunglasses, put up a hand. “Before Google here goes on another tangent… what’s so special about this chapel of yours? Why should we give a shit about this place?”

N’gath turned the screen around to show a crumbling stone building perched on the edge of a cliff. Snow had swallowed the trees around it, but it was as haunting as it was beautiful. “It’s in the San Juans. The chapel was built in the 1890s and rumor has it that it was meant for monks who live in the mountains there. It has since been abandoned for reasons unknown. Others say they left because they heard and saw… things.”

“Perfect! Let’s go record there and terrorize whatever’s in the mountains along the way! We could get some cool ghost stories out of this.” Markov smiled the kind of smile that meant he was already packing in his head.

“Guys, shouldn’t we think about this? The mountains? That’s a tall ask of us.” I said, trying to talk some sense into my bandmates.

N’gath continued, ignoring Markov and I. “The article said that the acoustics there are flawless and can make harmonies echo for minutes at a time.” He paused, his voice dipping lower. “It would make us sound like we were conjuring something evil and powerful. Our music will finally have teeth.”

Ishkanah shivered with excitement. “Teeth have a frequency you know. You can hear the tension in enamel if the room’s quiet enough.”

“I swear to God, Ish, sometimes I think you’re just making up words.” Valgavoth shot her a side-eye behind the sunglasses before turning back to N’gath. “So, are we taking a field trip there? We’re just going to Magic School Bus our asses and our gear up a mountain and hope we survive the elements? Great plan Einstein. What if the building collapses on us?”

“What if we don’t make it and we’re stranded up there? What then? I want this as badly as you guys, but I don’t think that the potential payoff is worth the risk.” I voiced my concerns, much to the dismay of Valgavoth.

“Sometimes in life, you have to be willing to risk everything. That’s what being in a band is about.”

N’gath put his phone into his pocket and crossed his arms against his chest. “There is nothing to worry about guys. The route to get there is safe, and the chapel is still structurally sound according to my research.”

“Oh, well if an article said it, then clearly it must be true.” Valgavoth spoke dryly.

Markov slammed his sticks together like a declaration of war. “I’m in! If the mountain wants to fight us, let it. A little snow and ice never scared me! Mom didn’t raise no bitch! I’ll drum on its corpse.”

Valgavoth sighed like a disappointed father before replying, “You can’t drum on a mountain’s corpse you dumbass,”

Markov shot a dirty look at Valgavoth as he twirled his drumsticks idly. 

Ishkanah bounced on her toes in a jittery kinetic blur. “We should test the acoustics with dissonant triads! Or drop-tuned tremolo lines! Or—”

“Lovely,” Valgavoth interrupted. “We’ll die and it’ll be because we annoyed the shit out of a spirit with jazz chords.”

“This could be the breakthrough,” N’gath exhaled slowly. 

“N’gath could be right.” I spoke after sitting on the idea for a moment. “This could be our breakthrough moment. We could finally capture that sound we’ve been looking for at this place.”

For a few seconds after I said that, the room went dead silent. Nobody said anything as everyone thought the situation over in their heads. None of us wanted to admit that we were desperate, but we were. Months of hard work were wasted, and our dreams were hanging on to the hopes that we were impulsive enough to make them a reality.

Seeing everyone so passionate and alive made me have a change of heart about my concerns. Looking at everyone’s faces, I could tell the others felt the same, strange mix of dread and excitement when you’re about to do something profoundly stupid but possibly life-changing. 

N’gath just stood there, hands folded in his sleeves like some gaunt prophet as we all nodded one by one. With no second thoughts, the five of us agreed to drive straight into the mountains with nothing but our gear, worse judgment, and corpse paint.

We packed everything we needed shortly afterward and began taking everything to the shitty white van we owned. As we loaded up the last of the equipment into the van, Valgavoth slid his sunglasses down his nose, and said, “If this thing breaks down on a mountain road and we get eaten by whatever cryptid is trending this month, I’m blaming all of you.”

N’gath didn’t say anything at first. He just placed his microphone gently on top of one of Ishkanah’s amps, like he was tucking a child into bed. Then, softly:

“The spirits of the mountain will guide us.”

“Are the spirits a more reliable guide than Mapquest, N’gath?” Valgavoth rolled his eyes and climbed into the passenger seat.

Ishkanah buckled herself in, eyes wide and bright like she hadn’t slept in three days. “Actually, mountains have specific harmonic signatures—”

“NOPE,” Markov shouted from the back before she could get started. “Not listening to your ramblings again. Last time, I lost a whole weekend.”

N’gath climbed into the driver’s seat as I sat next to Ishkanah, laughing at Markov’s gripes with her. I had barely fastened my seatbelt before the van growled to life, and we rumbled out of the city. 

The van shuddered as it drove down the road, as snow gathered on the edges of the highway in jagged, messy piles. Somewhere between the mile markers, I watched the sky turn a bruise-purple and listened to the engine screech like a dying animal. 

Ishkanah just stared out the window, her voice was unsettlingly calm as she spoke to no one in particular. “They left because they heard and saw things…what was meant by that exactly?”

Valgavoth slowly shook his head in awkward disapproval. “Ish, why are you like this? Haven’t you ever heard of folklore or superstitions?”

“From what I read, the town was evacuated and left abandoned due to a monster.” N’gath whispered, almost to himself. Before I could speak up, I noticed a recognizable golden arch. 

“Pull into that McDonald’s N’gath. I want a goddamn McRib.” Valgavoth pointed at the McDonald’s sign like it was salvation, only for us to discover the building was completely dark. There was not a single soul in the parking lot and the drive-thru menu hung half off its metal frame. 

He cursed under his breath for a full minute before muttering that the universe was “a tasteless bitch.” We all laughed hysterically at his bitterness, our laughter thinning out as we ascended higher into the mountains. 

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, but I remember waking to the sound of \\\*Beyond the Great Vast Forest\\\* by Emperor dissolving into static as our radio lost its signal. I looked out the passenger window to see that the roadside houses I’d been watching earlier had disappeared entirely into the darkness. 

Beyond the narrow cone of light from our dim headlights was but pitch-black pressing in. Snow whipped sideways, causing the asphalt from the road to be swallowed in places that erased the center line of the road entirely. The van hummed unevenly beneath us as the engine strained against the incline, causing the enclosed space to vibrate loudly. 

Valgavoth muttered something about the radio being garbage under his breath and reached for the dial to fix the signal. 

For a while, the only sounds were the engine’s labored whine and the rhythmic slap of snow against the windows. Every sweep of the windshield wipers smeared the world back into white noise. 

There were no signs of life other than the occasional reflective marker flashing and vanishing at the edge of the beams of our headlights. I found myself counting the seconds as I looked out the window, staring out at nothing. 

Suddenly, a heavy thud detonated against the passenger side. The metal of the vehicle boomed and I was driven hard into the door due to the impact, causing the breath to be punched clean out of my lungs. White sparks burst across my vision as N’gath fought the wheel. The van swerved violently across the narrow road toward the snow-choked shoulder before N’gath was able to stabilize the vehicle and snap us back onto the road.

Markov sat up in his seat having been woken up by the impact of whatever we had collided with. “What the hell was that?”

Before anyone could answer, an agonizingly slow, metallic scrape noise pierced the air. 

I turned my head to look outside my window, just in time to see a shape dart across the outside of our vehicle. I didn’t get a clear look, but before I could let anyone know about what I had seen, Ishkanah screamed. 

The roof dented inward and snow slid down the windshield in sheets from the weight pressing down above us.

“There’s someone on the van!” I cried out as another violent jolt rocked us forward.

“Hold on everyone!” N’gath declared through clenched teeth as he jerked the wheel hard to the left, causing us to fishtail. The tires screamed against the ice, the sudden force ripping the shape free from above. 

A sickening thud echoed through the still, night air as the body disappeared into the snowbank and the van came to a screeching halt several yards down the road. N’gath cut the engine and we sat in complete silence for what felt like an eternity trying to process what had just happened. 

Markov was the first to speak, his words being the ones to articulate what everyone else was afraid to speak into existence.

“I think…I think that was a guy.”

My stomach plummeted at the realization. We sat there in the freezing cold of the darkness, our breath fogging the windows as we listened for movement outside.

“We can’t just leave him,” Ishkanah pleaded in a whisper. “If we…if we killed someone—”

“WE…didn’t kill anybody. Got that?” Valgavoth turned in his seat to address us. “We’re going to pretend this didn’t happen and we’re going to drive away from here.”

“Are you fucking mental? We just hit a person and you want us to leave the scene of a crime?!” I cried out in anger as I reached for my door handle.

“We’re in the middle of fucking nowhere in the mountains Sherlock. Who is going to know? Besides, we were attacked first. We could just say it was in self-defense. The bastard was practically asking for this anyways.” 

Against my better judgment, I opened the door and felt the cold sting my face.

“Where are you going?” Markov asked as I unbuckled myself and stepped foot onto the snow-covered road outside.

“To do the right thing.”

No one moved at first. The only sound in the deafening quiet was the snow that continued to fall in thick sheets around the van. I half expected someone to argue or to tell me it was a bad idea, but guilt has a way of settling things faster than logic ever could. One by one, the hinges of the doors squeaked open, and seconds later, the sound of boots crunching in the snow could be heard following me. 

The darkness engulfed everything but the weak, yellow glow of our headlights as we made our way through the snow and into the treeline. My heart pounded harder with every step as the skid marks and churned powder morphed into dark smears until we approached the limp body at the end of the trail. 

“Jesus,” Markov whispered, his breath lingered in the air in a pale, trembling mist. “We killed him.”

I took another step closer, my boots crunching softly against the frozen terrain. Up close, something was off in a way I couldn’t articulate at the time. His clothes consisted of an old-fashioned dark coat and boots with no tread that were buried beneath the snow. The man’s chest didn’t rise, but I thought I saw the fingers of the arm twisted beneath him twitch.

“Guys, I think I saw movement.” I stated aloud as I approached and felt the ice-cold temperature of his hand against mine.

“We need to get him to a hospital!” Ishkanah declared as she crouched beside me to inspect the body.

Valgavoth rolled his eyes in annoyance. “We’re not taking him anywhere. He’s dead. End of story. Now let’s get back into the van before we freeze to death out here.” 

Before we could even acknowledge Valgavoth’s comment, the man’s eyes shot open. His pitch-black pupils reflected the van’s headlights before locking onto me. 

I didn’t have time to react. 

One moment he was in a crumbled heap in the snow, and the next he was airborne with the sudden and complete awareness of a predator.

The man tackled me and sent me sprawling backward hard enough to drive the air from my lungs in a panicked gasp. I screamed in terror as the man’s hands clamped down on both of my shoulders. His mouth ripped and tore at my hands as I raised them defensively on instinct. 

The demented and choked growling sound the man made didn’t sound like anything I had ever heard. It sounded ancient, primal, and most terrifying of all, hungry. His teeth scraped against the flesh of my hands, causing light drops of blood to fall onto my clothes. 

Ishkanah lunged forward instinctively, her fingers closing around my arm to pull me away, but the man reacted without turning to her. He struck her with one arm; the force sent her tumbling into the snow several feet away. She hit the ground hard, and her body let out a weak groan as she struggled to sit up.

“RUN!” Valgavoth shouted, his voice cracking as he rushed towards Ishkanah to drag her to safety while N’gath and Markov came to my aid.

Markov grabbed a nearby rock and launched it at the man’s head to seemingly no effect. N’gath found a decently sized tree branch on the ground and started whacking the man over the head with it in an effort to get him off of me.

After several sick thuds to the skull, the man lifted his head slowly. It was in that moment that we noticed that he wasn’t a man at all. He was something else entirely.

His mouth was dripping wet with saliva as he flashed his teeth and turned toward N’gath and Markov. I knew I had a small window of opportunity in that moment, so I took advantage of the distraction and pushed the man off me. 

I began running back to the van with the others, turning back once to see the frenzied gaze in the man’s eyes as we sprinted. The bitter cold tore at my legs and my lungs felt like they were on fire as we got closer to the van. 

Behind us, we heard a shrill scream echo as the man continued his pursuit. The headlights in the distance signaled safety as Valgavoth and Ishkanah were the first to reach the van.

Valgavoth helped Ishkanah get inside and yanked the driver’s side door open just as the rest of us were able to pile inside in a blind panic. Not even a moment later, the man slammed into the side of the vehicle, causing the entire van to shake. The metal groaned from the impact, the van nearly tipping over on its side.

“GO!” Markov yelled with urgency as Valgavoth turned to N’gath.

“GIMME THE FUCKING KEYS!!!” 

N’gath frantically searched his pockets and tossed them to Valgavoth. Outside, there was another screech and another thud that made the van slide a few feet across the road. Valgavoth turned the keys in the ignition, and floored it out of there.

The van jerked forward violently as we took off, but we were not alone. The man clung to the rear door and punched through the steel with his long, pale fingers. Under the immense pressure and strength of our attacker, the doors buckled and the metal began being ripped apart like paper.

“If he tears the doors open, we’re going to lose our equipment!” Markov shouted as he looked to Valgavoth for ideas.

Valgavoth never took his eyes off the road. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting from me, I’m the one driving!”

That’s when N’gath chimed in. “Ulalek, unlock the door and see if you can knock him off somehow.”

“Have you lost your goddamn mind?!” I protested. “How do you expect me to get this dude off our van?”

“FIGURE IT OUT!” Valgavoth jerked the wheel again, harder this time. The van’s tires screeched as we narrowly avoided contact with the guardrail. Whoever, or rather, whatever was clinging to the back barely reacted. A hand punched near the door handle, causing its fingers to curl inward.

Markov let out a laugh that was halfway between hysteria and shock. “Yeah, easy for you to say that while we’re being peeled open like a fucking can of Campbell’s.”

“STOP ARGUING,” Ishkanah snapped from her seat, where she was bracing herself against an amp.

I stared at the side door handle, as my heart pounded so hard it started to blur my vision. The metal surrounding the rear doors bowed inward again, and snow blasted through the holes in harsh, stinging bursts.

N’gath didn’t raise his voice, but instead remained calm as ever somehow. “You do not need to fight it, you only need to distract it.”

The van hit a bump and I slammed shoulder-first into the side of the vehicle. From outside, we could hear an excited scream echo as one of its hands disappeared through the door entirely. It dragged its fingers blindly along the interior metal as Valgavoth glanced in the rearview mirror at the sheer carnage unfolding.

“We’re running out of van!” He yelled before turning his attention back to the road, hands firmly planted on the steering wheel.

“No shit man!” I heard Markov scream as I unlocked the side door before I could second guess my decision. The moment the latch clicked, the door rattled violently and caved inward slightly. I hastily slid the door open, and in a blinding white rush, the icy wind bombarded the interior. 

I shuddered as I gripped the door, watching the road pass by in a blur below. I looked to my left and right, and it was on the right-hand side of the van that I could make out the man clinging sideways to the rear. Like a Spider clinging to a wall, gravity seemed to not have any effect on him in the slightest. 

With unsettling ease, the joints in his body flexed and adjusted with every jolt from our vehicle navigating the road. His knuckles were bloody and worn from the repeated seams and dents it left in the van. 

“What the fuck is going on out there?” Markov asked as he and Ishkanah watched me from inside.

I didn’t think about my next move, I just grabbed the first thing my hand found and held onto it like a lifeline. The mic stand I gripped was slick with the condensation from the palms of my sweaty, bleeding hands. I trembled at the wind tearing at me through the open door but braved the elements enough to slowly lean outside. 

The van rocked abruptly and nearly threw me out, causing me to instinctively grab onto the door and catch my balance. The thing clinging to the rear noticed my stumble and crawled across the metal towards me. Then, in an attempt to keep him at bay, I swung.

The metallic clang from the mic stand rang out on impact with its body and sent a rattling sensation through my arms. Its grip faltered and it shrieked with pain, but it didn’t let go. He hung there with his boots skidding uselessly against the bumper, scrabbling for purchase. With an outstretched arm, he turned toward me, and his blackened eyes locked onto mine. 

I tried to pull back and get the door shut as quickly as possible, but it lunged anyway. His mouth opened so wide that I could see his serrated teeth. 

As the gap between us closed, the van swerved, causing me to stagger and reflexively throw the mic stand up between us. I closed my eyes and felt an abrupt jolt, followed by a sickly thud and the sound of wheezing.

I opened my eyes to find his face pressed close to mine with the mic stand buried through his chest at an angle I hadn’t anticipated. Blood slid down the metal pole in slow, crimson drops that felt eerily warm against my hands. His breath washed over my face, smelling like rancid meat as it shuddered and gasped for life. All I could think in that moment was that I hadn’t meant to do that, I only wanted to make everything stop.

“DUDE YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Markov exclaimed as Ishkanah looked like she was trying her best to refrain from puking.

“You killed him?” N’gath asked as he turned around to see for himself.

“I’m putting this thing in park.” Valgavoth stated coldly as he gently pressed on the brakes and a few moments later, the van had come to a stop next to the guardrail.

I let go of the mic stand and watched the lifeless body whose blood covered my hands fall to the ground outside. I tossed the bloody, bent mic stand into the snow before N’gath could get a good look at it. For a while, the only sounds that could be heard were our ragged breathing, and the drip… drip… drip of gasoline leaking somewhere beneath us.

After what felt like eons, Ishkanah whispered the question that was on everybody’s minds. ”What do we do now?”

I swallowed the bile that had accumulated in my throat. “I’m not sure.”

“Like I told y’all earlier,” Valgavoth said. “We get rid of the body and pretend that none of this ever happened. Had everyone just listened to me we wouldn’t have ended up in this mess.”

“We can’t just pretend we’re safe here, we need to go back home. It’s too dangerous.” I looked at everyone in hopes that they would side with me.

He shook his head in frustration before slamming his hands down on the steering wheel. “In case you’ve forgotten jackass, we have traveled a long way to go to this place that N’gath INSISTED was the perfect place for recording our album. I’m not going to turn around just because some bozo doped up on ketamine or whatever thought that attacking our van in the middle of the night was peak entertainment.”

“He nearly killed us back there! You and I both know that he…he wasn’t human…  ” I explained before drifting off, afraid to finish my thought.

“Oh don’t tell me that you actually believe that this guy is what you’re trying to imply he is.” Valgavoth scoffed. “If you believe that then you’re a bigger dumbass than I thought.”

“No one here is a dumbass.” N’gath replied.

“Let’s just…move past this and work together as a group.” Ishkanah stated, still gripping to the loose equipment tightly as if any moment they could fall out.

“There is no moving past this, we leave now.” I insisted as I tried to reach for the keys in the ignition.

“You’re right, we leave now, but we’re not turning around.” Valgavoth swatted my hand away before I could touch the keys. “Newsflash, I’m the one behind the wheel so I’m in charge. I didn’t just nearly lose my life going up a mountain from your average meth head hanging around a 7/11 to not record this album. Now you guys can either join me or get the fuck out of this van and y’all can party it up out here in the tundra.”

An uncomfortable quiet overtook the van as everyone sat and pondered the next course of action. Nobody wanted to challenge Valgavoth’s stubborn, headstrong nature, but at the same time, nobody wanted to have this trip mean nothing.

“Look, we did come all this way. Let’s just get rid of the body and get out of here.”

That was the most level-headed and down-to-earth response I had ever heard leave Markov’s mouth. His words earned an approving nod from Valgavoth who turned the keys in the ignition to start the van up.

“Now we’re talking. Let’s make this fast, I want to make it to our destination by sunrise so we can get some proper rest.”

The engine purred unevenly as we stepped out into the cold once more, the snowfall and wind biting through our clothes.

Up close, the body looked monstrous in a way I hadn’t noticed before. I tried not to think about it or so much as make eye contact with the body as we lifted and dragged it toward the rail. My boots slipped on the ice, forcing my breath to come out in a burst of panic.

“It’s okay,” Ishkanah whispered quietly, just barely audible above the crunch of the snow. “You’re okay.”

N’gath and Markov nodded in agreement as Valgavoth kept his focus and grip on the body. Her reassurance helped me steady myself as best as I could to complete the task at hand. None of us spoke a word as we approached a narrow turnout where the guardrail bent inward. The area in that spot dropped away into nothing but darkness, and that’s where we decided to dispose of the body.

Together, as one, we heaved. When we went to let go, the coat from the body nearly got caught on the metal rail causing the fabric to snag against the long-rusted bolts. With a united shove from all of us however, the body tipped, rolled, and vanished over the edge.

I’m not entirely sure how long we stood there, but I know it was longer than we should have. We expected to hear a scream, a thud, or something that confirmed gravity still worked the way it was supposed to. But we never heard anything aside from the vast, engulfing sound of silence and its aftermath.

Eventually Valgavoth muttered and broke the silence. “Let’s get back to the van.”

With that, we all walked back to the van, secured the back doors, and got settled in. Valgavoth pressed his foot down on the gas and we surged ahead into the night. 

A little while later, Ishkanah spoke, her voice barely audible above the whir of the engine. “Is this why the town was abandoned?”

Nobody cut through the stunned silence except for Valgavoth who didn’t even bother looking at her.

“No,” he said immediately. “And don’t say that again.”

That was the last time any of us decided to speak.

I’m writing this as we continue toward the chapel, too anxious to feel how exhausted my body must be feeling right now as I’m pressed against the equipment. No one has spoken since we got back on the road, and I don’t think anyone plans to. 

I keep watching the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following us through the snow, but the road behind us is empty from what I can tell. 

A part of me knows we should turn back, that whatever we threw over that guardrail was an omen, but this trip is everything we’ve worked toward, and no one is willing to be the first to say that fear meant more than our dreams. 

If something else happens, I’ll give an update. If I don’t, then understand that nothing stopped us from turning back.

They turned a corner near the admin lift, and nearly collided with Director Hale, who was heading the same way, data pad tucked under one arm.

Hale raised an eyebrow, then chuckled. “Looks like we’re all heading to eat, huh?”

Edward nodded once, a small grin tugging at his scarred mouth. “Seems that way, sir.”

The three men fell into step together, boots ringing in easy rhythm on the grated deck.

They pushed through the mess hatch. The serving line was open, and a cheerful woman behind the counter  ""mid-fifties"", hair pulled back in a practical knot, waved them over.

“We’ve got a good special today, boys,” she called. “Chicken-fried steak, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, and biscuits. All the fixings.”

Edward and Hale exchanged a quick look, then spoke in unison: “Sounds good.”

Titus paused, tray in hand. “What… is chicken-fried steak?”

The woman burst out laughing. Edward barked a deep chuckle, and even Hale’s stern face cracked into a rare, genuine smile.

Hale recovered first, still grinning. “Make that three specials.”

They loaded their trays: Hale and Edward grabbed steaming mugs of black coffee; Titus opted for a bottle of water. The favorite table by the viewport was taken, so they claimed a quieter one near the back wall.

They sat. Hale gestured at Titus’s plate. “Go ahead and eat, kid. Russell and I’ll talk.”

Edward leaned back, sipping coffee. “We’re taking it easy this morning. Safety review, station tour. In another hour or so we’ll hit the sims—takeoffs, touch-and-go landings, the basics.”

Hale nodded, eyes on his own plate. “Standard practice, Russell?”

“Standard practice,” Edward confirmed.

Hale grunted approval. “I’ll look at the vids later.”

Titus dug into the chicken-fried steak—crispy breading, tender meat underneath, rich gravy pooling over creamy mashed potatoes. He ate steadily, almost methodically. By the time the older men had taken a few bites, his plate was nearly clean.

Hale noticed, eyebrows rising. “Kid, slow down. Enjoy it.”

Titus looked up, sheepish. “Can I get more?”

Both men laughed, deep, rolling laughs that filled the quiet corner of the mess.

Hale shook his head, amused. “Go on.”

Titus hurried back to the line. Edward and Hale watched him go, still chuckling.

Edward leaned toward Hale, voice low. “Reminds you of anyone?”

Hale smiled, pointing first at Edward, then at himself. “Twenty years ago. You. Me. Same damn table, same damn hunger.”

Titus returned with a second helping, sat, and started eating again—this time a little slower.

Hale took a sip of coffee, eyes on Titus. “I see you’ve met Cathy and Kelly.”

Titus nodded, swallowing. “Yes, sir.”

“Those girls are like sisters around here,” Hale continued. “Family. I watched your landing vid again this morning, clean as hell. You be nice to them. They’re good people. Off duty "" looking at Edward  "" we’re like uncles to them.

Titus’s ears went pink again.

Hale laughed softly. “You all right, kid?”

Edward smirked. “Reminds me of you and Patty back in the day.”

Hale pointed a fork at him. “Watch it, you old fossil.”

Both men laughed again, easy and familiar.

They finished lunch. Hale was about to stand when Edward spoke up, tone casual but pointed.

“Hale… about the kid’s messages. He heard back from his mom in just a few days. Express?”

Hale glanced at Titus, who was listening quietly. “His mom is Vickie Staples.”

Edward turned slowly to look at Titus. “Okay. I understand now, young man.”

Titus blinked, confused. “Yes, that’s my mom’s name.”

Edward’s expression softened. “Your mom is well known in the Guild, Titus. All good. She keeps the lanes working—everybody knows it. Next time you talk to her, tell her everyone here says thanks.”

Titus frowned slightly. “How does that get my messages there faster?”

Hale leaned forward. “It doesn’t. Communication is handled by the Principality. Your mom has powerful friends.”

He paused, letting that sink in.

Titus looked between them. “We’re… commoners?”

Edward and Hale exchanged a glance, then shook their heads in unison, smiling.

Hale stood. “Got to go. I’ll watch the sims. Good work today, Titus.”

He clapped Edward on the shoulder and headed out.

Edward looked at Titus. “Let’s hit the sims. Time to let you do some landings.”

He added with a grin, “Proper ones.”

They walked to the sim bay, an old shuttle fuselage mounted on a full 360 degree  platform, cockpit wired with the latest holo displays.

Titus climbed into the captain’s seat. Edward settled in co-pilot.

Titus ran the checklist out loud: “Fuel, navigation, systems check?”

Edward glanced at the board. “All lights green.”

They spent the next hour in the sim: takeoffs from different grav wells, touch-and-go landings on spinning outposts, emergency aborts, crosswind corrections. Every maneuver perfect. Titus’s hands were steady, his calls crisp.

When the session ended, Edward powered down the platform and looked over.

“Titus,” he said—using the name deliberately, no “kid” this time—“don’t forget to get your hour of running in.”

He winked. “I’ll see you later.”

Edward headed toward a side stairway, disappearing into the corridors.

Titus sat for a moment in the quiet sim cockpit.

He called me Titus.

A small, surprised smile spread across his face.

He climbed out, stretched, and headed back to his cabin to change into running gear, the station’s hum feeling a little more like home with every step.

1qbbxu8,https://i.redd.it/o85j470dd0dg1.jpeg,2018 Familia Torres Priorat “Salmos” | 🇪🇸,"New region for me! Continuing with my efforts to know more about Spain & Italy, I picked up this bottle at my local shop after asking the owners for something Spain that wasn't a Rioja. Did my research on the region prior to opening it - and my first thought was to compare it to Southern Rhones, based on the grapes. This bottling is a blend of Garnacha and Cariñena (Grenache & Carignan), fermented in steel/oak, then aged over a year in French oak - bottled in early 2021. Interestingly enough, there are multiple sources online claiming this blend has Syrah in it - fortunately, I found the producer's own data sheet that refutes this. While not labeled as such yet, later vintages are marked as ""Vi de Vila"" - village level wines in Priorat, in this case solely from the village of Porrera, where the producer is located (their classification system appears similar to Burgundy's). Stored at 55 - took a taste then decanted over two hours. Paired with seared pork.

Visually, a medium ruby color, leaning a little darker than a pure Garnacha wine.

On the nose, copious amounts of ripe red fruits - strawberry, cherry, raspberry - the familiar scent of kirsch that I know well from the Southern Rhone. Pastry fillings, dried fruits, candied fruits - bit of licorice? I was expecting to pick up the seasoning/spice note of the Southern Rhone too, but no garrigue here! Further into the bottle as it warms and gets more air, mineral notes - limerock and river rocks; wood and cedar.

On the palate, medium bodied - with a very fine tannic nibble (Christ, I hate to use ::velvety:: as a descriptor, but -) and a strong backbone of acid. Flavors of candied red fruits & pepper, bit of smoke as it goes down. Very tasty with the seared pork chops. The 14% never called to itself, and to my surprise, the sell sheet listed a tiny amount of residual sugar (0.8g/L) which I could not pick up at all. Decent finish, I'd say right in its prime window, the components were all in balance.

Alright, conclusions - I believe I made a mistake in comparing it immediately to all the Rhones I've drank (along with Sauternes, the region I'm most familiar with). At ~$45 (checking online, I see it does go for less) I'd rather have a similarly aged Domaine de la Charbonniere CdP or a Saint Cosme Gigondas, because I'm quite fond of the intense herbs/seasoning note at the outset and that roasted meats/chocolate/coffee/cocoa note as it warms. Fully understanding that these notes come from the grape varieties being different (mourvedre/syrah in the Rhone blends) - as well as the terroir itself, I think I need to remove these comparisons before opening my next Priorat. I enjoyed the strong acid & silky tannins, but I want a little more complexity at that price point (or perhaps I'm mistaking complexity here for preference, as the limerock/smokey note was certainly different). At $25-30 I'd be more forgiving, and it definitely has the characteristics to be a great sipping wine sans meal pairing given how balanced all the elements were. I still want to know more about the region, so I will try other producers and bottlings. Shouldn't have taken my baggage with me on this trip!

MOST people function much better if they sleep from 10pm-6/7am instead of 3am-11/12pm (i promise from experience and someone who loved staying up late, you feel better).

When you wake up, drink water before your coffee. Atleast a cup, you can manage i promise.

Go to the gym atleast 3x a week. Do things your body deserves despite how you feel emotionally, take “motivation” out of it and just build discipline. Look i know it’s not that easy, but it’s also not that hard, we make this shit way harder than it has to be.

i was literally a smoker of 16 years between vapes & cigarettes, stayed up till 3am woke up at 1pm, always felt like fucking ass but just assumed it was normal, ate like shit. Ate a lot of sugar & chips. i didn’t workout, and i’d go to the doctor and when they would say “you’re healthy” i wouldn’t believe them. I was healthy, I AM healthy. i just treat my body like shit and was expecting a pill to fix it. I quit smoking and just started doing these things. That’s it.

i also started using the app FeedLite to remove Reels and Shorts from my feed because i needed to stop the mindless scrolling to actually stay consistent. Its not a quick fix, but it helps It sucked for awhile but i didn’t let that emotion determine if i was still going to stick to MY rules. - do things despite emotions.

i get mental health, i’m also on meds. But like you can’t expect the meds to build you strong muscles you feel me? There’s no “quick fix” you also DO have to put in the effort hence why you NEED to do things despite how you feel emotionally.

Once you’ve done just those 3 things i’m telling you, you’ll feel better than you feel right now. You might still be depressed, but it won’t be as bad. You begin to build purpose and have intention with what you do and it makes living worth it.

my first time posting on here so if I miss anything important that‘s still nice to know let me know!

Anyway, I‘m 24F and so preferably I‘m looking for someone at least 21+ but at least over 18 as I‘m not comfortable writing with minors! 

I don‘t mind playing male or female characters (or anything in between ;) for you but doubling is a must for me especially in Fandom RPs, when it‘s OCxOC then doubling is not a must. 

Preferably I‘m looking for a long term writing partner but I know that of course depends on how well we vibe with each other! That being said I‘m totally okay and welcome OOC talk as I like getting to know my rp partners, I think it does help with communication and coming up with ideas that both parties would enjoy. :) 
I don‘t expect 24/7 availability we got both our own lives and it‘s mainly about having fun and having a place to be creative together! 

I can write (as I would personally say) decently long when I want to, but I‘m not for writing long just to write long, some scenes require a faster pacing like quick dialogue and I personally think shorter answers are totally cool during that, cause I don’t wanna spend 3 days finishing up a breakfast scene just cause it‘s expected to write 5 paragraphs of why my character declines a cup of coffee. (Of course this is kinda exaggerated but I think you get what I‘m saying)

I‘m fine with literature, semi-lit and even script-writing style however I want detailed answers! 
So if you‘re preferring script I‘m totally fine with that I just wanna see more then just **he nods** like give me exposition, a thought process anything but one liners :)

Other than that I‘m totally open for different writing styles and I generally speaking try to mirror my partner. I‘m sure we can find a middle ground!

I do love Fandom RP but I‘m also down for OC stories only and us creating our own little world and story! 

When it comes to Fandom RP I only do OCxCC and not CcxCc, it’s just my preference cause then I simply enjoy writing my own fanfiction much more than roleplaying! :) 

Obviously Romance tends to be a big part of any longterm story but I also enjoy other aspects in stories and roleplays so it should be more than just romance but i’m totally fine and welcome added romance into engaging story ideas - no matter if we‘re talking Fandom or OC Rps.

I‘m in a lot of Fandoms and listing them all would probably be too long so if you have smth on your mind I haven’t listed just shoot me a message and I might even know it!
But just to name a few I‘m into: Marvel (mostly MCU but I‘m welcoming any further introductions into the comics!), Stranger Things, GoT, Star Wars, Hunger Games, Vampire Diaries, Death Note, Jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsaw Man as you see there are a lot :)

For any original roleplay ideas I‘m open for honestly anything be it from fantasy to some post apocalyptic zombie apocalypse.

Anyway if anyone stuck through reading all this, feel free to just comment or shoot me a message :)

First I want to disclaim a few things. 

I have a few learning disabilities so I apologise if I get words wrong or punctuation. 

I 21 female was friends with sarah 20 female (not her real name) for 9 years. We met at a youth group in our local town when we was young. And due to that became friends. As we approached highschool we became closer. We never really had anything issues apart from silly things but as years went on I noticed when sarah was mad she would take it out on me and I would accept it. 

We had the normal issues of falling out and becoming friends again too. However after 4 years I noticed it was a pattern that would happen every year where she would randomly hate me for 2 months then act like nothing ever happened. There has been all times where I lend her clothes and they came back stained or ripped, aswell as I will always lend money however sarah never paid me back, never have been the controversial type so I always forgive and forget. 

I have came to redit as this is a more recent issue stemming back to a year or more ago. 

Me and sarah are not in same year groups. She is one below me. 

So around 2 years ago I made new friends and got familiar with a group of people. Sarah was not in this group for the first year. When I would talk about the group she would roll her eyes tell me to shut up or just act like she wasn’t listening. So I slowly stopped. Then when a year came around she joined the group and acted like everyone loved her and yes I was happy as my best friend got on with my group, however some issues started to show. 

The first time I felt like I noticed something is when a friend Olivia that me and sarah share came to me asking me why I never show up to group advents. I asked what she was talking about? And she mentioned the past 3/4 moths they have been going out after work/college and that they asked sarah if I was coming. Apparently sarah always said that I couldn’t make it due to work or that I was with my partner. I was confused why sarah never asked me as I was always free apart from Wednesday a Sundays (as the rest of the group Knew). 

Me and Olivia carried on talking and said that next time she will call me her self. 

I understand why some people went to sarah as at this point we was friends 7 years and we saw each other nearly every day. 

I brushed it off thinking it was an accident and never brought it up to sarah, my second incident happened around October, where I noticed 2 of my close friends started to drift. I asked if they was okay and tried to continue to make plans however they were both busy, yet I saw on social media that sarah was always at one of there houses.  I tried talking to sarah but she said she didn’t know and that they became close as they lived near by one and another. I understood and just focused more on work and the others in the group. 

After Christmas I started feeling really low and overwhelmed with large crowds and how I felt about my self, I tried to understand why I felt so insecure but couldn’t understand where it was coming from. When I spoke to Izzy 20female. She asked if anyone in the group had been making me feel uncomfortable. Izzy has been a long time friend for 14+ years and she is more introverted and keeps to her self, I see her around once a moths due to how far we live. I was thinking back and explained to her every now and then I got a back handed comment from sarah. She asked me like what? I explained there was a day we was getting ready for a party at a friends house 5+ girls and that I felt a bit off about the dress I was wearing. Sarah said to me yeh it doesn’t suit your type. I was a bit taken aback but thought she was being honest. (I am a size 8-10 depending what shop) there has been other times where she said that me and my partner don’t suit each other and that he is out of my league. Also commenting on my style. Izzy asked me if I have brought this up to sarah and I expressed I haven’t as I don’t like conflict. She suggested me to go get coffee with her and talk to her. 

So I did. A few days later me and sarah went out. I expressed to her how I am grateful for how she is honest to me yet some times it was a bit harsh or too straightforward. Sarah was apologetic straight away and said she doesn’t think before she speaks. I thought that was the end of it.. 

We are now in February and me and sarah have drifted to different sides of the group but we still hung out at least once a week and I was happy with that. It was coming to February the 14Th (Valentine’s Day) and some of the girls in the group wanted to plan a girls night. I offered to host it at my house as I was always the ‘event place’ and we all agreed. (I couldn’t spend Valentine’s Day with my partner as he was working that night, same with some of the other girls). I wanted to go all out and decorate the living room in to a cozy place and make a prop wall for a ‘photo booth’ effect. The day came and 9 girls came. The night was going well we was cooking drinking and making craft things. Till one of the girls brought out this game. It was like spin the bottle however on the bored game was 5 prompts. Truth, embarrassment, spin again, rule, or drink. 

We had a few goes till it was my turn and I got truth. Sarah was eager to give me a truth. She said “why are you on the pill?”

Back ground: the pill is used to prevent pregnancy or stop the “Mother Nature” 

(The reason why I came on the pill was a few years back where I was in a abusive relationships with my ex and I went on it as an incident happened that let me with physical and mental trauma) (a story for another time ig) sarah knew why I went on it. So I said the most obvious reason “because I get bad cramps and pain”. It caught me off guard and Izzy looked at me shocked knowing why I went on it. The next time it was my turn sarah’s friend wanted to give me a truth and went “have you ever had a pregnancy test scare”. I said “no” and then I got a bit uncomfortable and left the room for abit.

Izzy came after me and knew something was wrong. I explained to her what happened in the past with said ex and tha only sarah knew why I was on this pill. Izzy explained that sarah did that maliciously and she can’t believe that she would do that to me in a large group. I said she might not of done it on purpose and left it at that. 

A few months went by and 2 girls left the group due to drama with sarah and other girls. I didn’t want to be involved however I stayed in touch with the two girls. 

I met up with may female 21 and she told me why she left the group, she explained sarah was causing drama with her and a few others making up story’s about her and telling her she isn’t a true friend as she wanted to spend some days with her partner. I apologised as I don’t know any of this was going on and that I am here to support her. May then changed the topic and asked me if I was ok. I was confused and asked why, she explained after that girls night in February she confronted sarah and asked her why did she ask me questions that made me uncomfortable. Sarah apparently got mad and said it wasn’t any of her business and that I shoudnt get involved. May then explained after that sarah was going around with photos of my partner saying to some of our friends that he should of ended up with her and not me, that they would of been a better match and that I got her seconds. I was shocked and explained to may that sarah was interest in my partner when we first met but he didn’t feel the same about her. She tried to get with him on multiple occasions but he kept rejecting her. May was shocked and told me that sarah didn’t explain it like that, she told people she rejected him as she wanted the best for me and that she knew I was interested in him. 

After that I was a bit lost and confused about how me and sarah stood as friends. Around the time of February sarah started dating her current boyfriend too, and was acting more distant and rude to others. 

I didn’t get on with her boyfriend as he was rough and dint understand that not everyone wanted to get a dig in the arm or wanted to be pushed about. 

June was approaching and the group wanted to throw a party. I was asked if it was okay if it was at my house. I said sure and began planning. I had a few rules to the party. 1. Please no arguing as I had elderly neighbours. 2. Everyone pay £5 and that can cover food and drinks. (If you wanted more you can bring it too) 3. Please respect the house like it was your own. 

The day came and everything was ready. I put around £100 of my own money in to the food drinks and decorations to cover the difference. I had around 25+ people come including there partner if they was dating. Sarah and her boyfriend was the last to show up. Already intoxicated and arguing. I tried to talk to sarah asking if she was ok and she told me to shut up and mined my own business. (For people wondering I don’t tend to drink unless it is me and one other person. As I am not a big drinker) I understood and carried on with the party. I had one of my friends come up to me around 10:00pm saying sarah and her boyfriend have got in a massive argument and have moved it on to the street. I was shocked and went out with one of my male friends to see if they was okay, sarah came in crying expressing that she isn’t happy and that he is saying other girls names to her as her name. I calmed her down and told her she is better off without him. She needs to value herself. She calmed down and carried on with the party. Later on in to the evening I came in from the garden and went up stairs to the bathroom. As I walked in I noticed someone had punched a hole in my wall. I was angry and filled with rage. I turned off the music and made everyone go in to the living room. I was shaking and asked who has been in the bathroom from 10:00pm-11:00pm no one answered. I explained how I have found a hole in my wall and that the party is over. (I have hosted birthdays, Halloween, Christmas, new year parties 10+ times and never had any issues with braking stuff) one of my friends told me to look and their hands and see if there is cuts. As I was sarah’s boyfriend asked me to go in to the kitchen to talk to him, he explained that one of the lads did it out of anger and he ‘tried to stop him’ I asked who and he gave me a name. The boy who he told me it was wouldn’t ever hurt anyone, not a bug, a human or an animal. I was shocked and spoke to that boy, he cried to me saying he doesn’t remeber if it was him or not but if sarah’s boyfriend claims he saw him do it it must be him. The party ended. 

A few days later i had one of the girls and her boyfriend in the group come over and hang out with my and my boyfriend. She was nervous and wanted to talk to me. Olivia said her boyfriend knows who put the hole in my wall, I said oh who, he told me it was sarah’s boyfriend and that he was angry because of sarah. He saw him come out of the bathroom as the other boy went in, after that I was angry that I was lied to, upset that someone disrespected my house. I tried to speak to sarah seeing if it was true and she had a go at me saying I’m throwing accusations and that I always had it out for her and her bf. 

I tried to tell her how I’ve felt recently and how her bf makes me uncomfortable and that I need her to talk to me because I don’t understand where all of this hatred is coming from. 

After that we didn’t speak.

September came around and the group drifted, I was still close to most of the girls but got more shifts at my job so coudnt go out as much, apart from Izzy me and Olivia was close too. 

However Olivia’s ended up finding out her boyfriend was cheating on her and he broke up with her, I was there for her through the whole brake up and tried to look after her. Yet so was sarah and it made it difficult as we wasn’t talking to one and another. One day Olivia turned around and told me that I’m being distant and that I don’t value our friendship. (I want to specify that I became busy at work, became really ill for a few weeks and that I coudnt see anyone as I was bed bound) she knew all of this 

I tried to apologise and told her I’ll make more of an effort. After that Olivia was making plans and was trying to include me and sarah, we both didn’t want to be with each other as I never got an apology and she hated me. After that I set boundaries with a few of our shared friends asking if they make plans and invite sarah please don’t invite me. (At this time I was struggling a lot with mental health) 

I was told from a few friends who I was still speaking to that Olivia was now hating me with sarah and that and pathetic because I used my illness as an excuse. I was upset and shocked. 

I went out a few nights later for my partners birthday with a few others and Olivia was there, she asked if we had any issues and I said no not really but can we not talk about it today as it’s my partner’s birthday. She agreed and never brought it up again. 

I stopped talking to Olivia for around 2 months after that and one day she sent me a massive text going “look, I don’t want to fall out with you, but your being pathetic, at the end of the day I’m trying to save your 9 year friendship with sarah, and I’m guessing you would of done the same for me. I’m not trying to go against your boundaries however can’t we all just put it behind us, it’s pathetic I just want to be a group again, Ik it was wrong of me for making plans with you and not telling you sarah was there however your just making everyone feel awkward, it’s not my fault ok. Also I don’t appreciate that you wanted me to choose u or sarah. And I’m not trying to exclude you from the next girls night I just don’t understand why we all can’t be there?”

My reply was: “I understand how u was trying to help but it didn’t and I just wished u accepted how I felt, second I never want you to pick a side but I did want you to be my friend and understand how I felt and how I am hurt and still hurting, it felt like you just wanted to ignore my half of my feelings and issues to benefit everyone els, and I know your not excluding me I said I rather not show up or make my own plans a different day, I never said you was excluding me from girls night? I have expressed to some one that I was upset that even after me and u have spoken multiple times that I didn’t want to be around some people you was still making plans and I felt sick and upset bc I would have to say no and I don’t want to put pressure on people. And I’m distancing my self bc I’m choosing my self, I haven’t binned you off I have been upset with the past two weeks with how you have accused me of ignoring you (the day I had to send u a ss of my screen time bc I had a long shift) and I wasn’t ignoring u and I never got an apology or u even saying u was over thinking, and I understand you want to fight for my friendships to but I have done my self and I have chosen to stop as I am so tired and fed up of putting my feelings aside. And no there hasn’t been any effort from me since everything has kicked off cos I rather keep my distance then have drama, that is my choice I don’t want arguments and also the fact I keep getting little comments thrown at me in gc isn’t fair and that’s why I’m distancing my self, for my self. Me being ill was the most understanding excuse I have been extremely poorly and when I tried to tell you and apologise I didn’t get anything back I just got a ok, so if I’m seeing u be dry with me and I tried to put the effort in to telling u why I can’t make it and u can’t make the effort back is a good reason why I’m not texting, you have hurt me badly and upset me. I never want you to choose sides I have never been like that and never will. You can choose who u want to be friends with, so can I. And I don’t want it forced

Olivia: yes i know i should of accepted it but i just want us all to be friends and go back to how it use to be cos those times were so good. i was being your friend and i still am am i not? i do understand how you felt but i just want us all to put it behind us and get along. i wasn’t ignoring your feelings i have understood them but the way you was acting was pathetic. but then you don’t make plans and it’s hard cos we want you and your bf there out with us but use don’t when it’s so easy to come and just not talk to who you don’t want to talk to. i have also been upset with you but i have tried i’ve asked you multiple times if you have a problem we need to talk and you’ve always said no when you clearly do have these problems and it would of been softer time ago if you just admitted it to me. yes u showed me ss but at that point i was on delivered for 18h  while other people wasn’t and i felt ignored by you like anyone else would in my situation. but there hasn’t been any effort from you since the pub i’ve tried i really have especially for us to talk it out and it hasn’t happened. and it’s not drama there is no drama u and sarah don’t have to and won’t talk anymore but can still talk to everyone else. i have only ever made one comment and i thought it was a funny comment yes it came across bitchy but it was just a joke. but i’m going to get sick of u saying no to plans you said you’d be at cos yes u was ill but it’s always the excuse u can’t do things cos your ill instead of saying im just not feeling it or i dont want to. but eveyone in this situation is going insane cos your not with us anymore 

There is more that happened after that but that’s the gist of it? Izzy and may said I wasn’t and that it was small things adding up that made me finally let go. I don’t know what to do?

1qbbu8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1qbbu8c/recruiter_scam_on_indeed/,Recruiter scam on Indeed.,"My backstory: I have a background in tech, a degree in Multimedia Design, and I spent the last decade working at Hop Valley in Eugene OR. Started as a temp, quickly became a production lead, and was a brewer for the last 3+ years. Hop Valley was shut down in July as part of production consolidation by the new corporate owners; sad times all around. This has been an amazingly terrible year for job hunting. As I come up on the end of my unemployment benefits, my wife and I are getting stressed AF. I'm mentally preparing to go back to temping.

So imagine my glee when I get a response through email last Thursday (8JAN26) to an application I filed on Indeed Monday (5JAN26) for a position with Agrotech. It checked all the boxes: 30 hrs/week, 45$/hr, fully remote, as an Internal IT Support Help Desk. 50 hour weeks, 10 hour days, of sweaty dusty work in 100+ degree heat in the summer, below freezing in the winter, and constant 100% humidity were common on the brew deck. My body has suffered from that stressful environment, I'll be 40 this year and need to slow down.

Enter G.B. from Agrotech. Informs me I've been selected to begin a 'pre-employment interview process.' Attaches me a PDF instructing me to download and connect on MS Team with the managing recruiter. Easy enough, I contact M.R. on Teams and he asks me through text (the entire process was text and email only - Red Flag) for some trivial basic information about my background and experience, elaborating and expanding on my resume. Says he'll pass me onto HR and I should hear something back from them about next steps Monday 12JAN26.  
  
All weekend I'm holding my breath, I don't want to get excited. But my wife and kid are ecstatic that Daddy may finally have found a new better job. We live in a cramped one bedroom apartment, my kid just turned 5, and he really needs his own room sooner than later.

Today I wake up, take the kid to preschool, come home, and make coffee. I wait on pins and needles for an email about next steps. 0855 I get a message on Teams that I've been accepted as a new hire. ***What?*** 

What about next steps, an actual on screen face-to-face interview with someone? I don't ask, but the first RED FLAG has been planted. M.R. says he'll be sending me the new hire packet through email and he needs my address to send paperwork and the computer I'm to use. Fair enough, I share my address.

1120 I receive a welcome aboard email from G.B. 3 PDFs, the first is a 'job orientation packet'. I start reading. It's a 4 page slide show saved as a PDF.

1st page has a low res stretched out company logo and a random employee ID#, I studied graphic design in college and I'm instantly appalled at this 'professional' document (let's call it a half-mast red flag).

2nd page, job description, nothing noteworthy other than a change in font. Clearly they need a graphic designer, or a half competent HR to whip up some better boilerplate but whatever I have actually seen worse if you can believe it. 

3rd page, now things are getting spicy. There's a list of equipment they're going to be sending me to setup my home office and the first one jumps off the page. An Apple MacBook Pro 16"", why is that so special you may wonder? Because they listed the specs! An i7 running OS 10.14 Mojave... That's from 2017! *Da Fuq?!* That can't be right, they also list an HP scanner/fax, a Laminator, a shredder, and wireless headset. All from **2017!** Weird but I don't need the latest tech, I could use a Chromebook for all I care.

4th page they list all the software and services I'll be expected to use and, for absolutely no reason at all, the total price of that software/service package \~10k, as well as a never before mentioned sign-on bonus. Maybe a layman would be impressed by 10k in software but I've used Maya. I've managed software licences for over 500 computers; I'm bemused by the need to include that particularly unimpressive information.

PDF 2, they want me to set up and authorize direct deposit to my banking account... over email! BIGGEST RED FLAG possible. No legitimate biz would ask for that out of a secure portal. At this point I know it's a scam. I would have given them banking details if they had a portal, I've established an account separate from my primary accounts just for receiving direct deposits for remote work. You really can't be too careful these days.

PDF 3, they want photos of my ID front and back for a ""background check,"" Same big ass red flag as before. These guys are looking to steal identities and drain accounts.

I'm sad it wasn't legit but I decided to start digging. See what I missed in my initial excitement.

G.B.'s email came from  [agro-techcareers.fr](http://agro-techcareers.fr/), that website redirects to [agro-tech.fr](http://agro-tech.fr) with a copyright date of 2017, broken graphics and French phone number. No American based contact information anywhere. That website's recruitment link goes to [https://dealerjobs.deere.com/](https://dealerjobs.deere.com/) matching the established narrative that the company started as a merger between multiple John Deere dealerships.

I try to find G.B. He has a LinkedIn profile registered as a recruiter for Agrotech, but the company itself doesn't have a LinkedIn page. He joined in 2018, has never posted anything, and only has \~30 contacts. 

M.R. was listed as Marko in the first PDF I received, but Marco on Teams, no public profiles exist connecting the name and company.

I start trying to find if this is a legit business being imitated for recruitment scams. The websites did link to deere.com. The full name in the logo is 'Agrotech Group ASL'.  After a few minutes I find [http://www.groupeasl.fr/](http://www.groupeasl.fr/), same french phone number, and the original stolen then stretched out logo in the PDFs, complete with a current c.2026.

Well, that was quite fun. It seems Kate was able to win Douglas over, atleast temporarily

He's pretty arrogant, but Kate was able to use his good side against him, which is that he treasures his friends, so he's scared of them succumbing to the same fate as Louise

Also, Matilda and Mattie look really promising. I guess Laurel and Lulu also, kind of

Stella and Candy look as if early clumsy Emilyko wasn't a quick learner and if the shadow was affected by that aswell. She'll probably need far more time to settle, but i feel like she.. may have potential.. hopefully

Oscar and Oskar look pretty promising! Not sure how to feel about Danny, he'll prob be chaotic like John

This reminds me of TPN even more.. Douglas's behavior sorta reminds me of Ray and the preparations for the debut aswell

Also, not to say it is wrong, because saving everyone for sure isn't wrong, but this kind of preparation for the debut is pretty bold especially that they'll have to drink the brainwashing coffee. I wonder how will Kate prevent that? Perhaps, she just told them to not drink it because as far as i remember from Kate's actions during the debut - drinking the coffee is actually not a requirement. Emilyko kind of devoured it after seeing it'd go to waste, because Kate didn't want it. Though that actually just resulted in them having more information, which is a good thing. However, Edward may try to enforce it to see what happens to them. Perhaps, in that case, Kate will just undo the brainwashing with water or something like that. I guess you could call it a chi- ahem, japanese water torture :D 

That King guy sure does seem arrogant, perhaps one of Edward's new helpers. Star bearers for sure weren't informed about the inspection, and it seems at the end the guy got suspicious of Ram aswell. Also, i didn't realise it, but isn't that also the guy who sabotaged Douglas's senior whom he respected in the past? He isn't here anymore so it makes sense he ascended, and onto the 1st floor aswell

Douglas, for sure won't stand this guy for even a second, and if Kate is able to convince him he's connected to Edward perhaps he'll be far more wary of Edward aswell. I can definetely see him being a double agent in the near future, perhaps reporting fake info to Edward. That'd be cool

If Kate was able to convince Douglas the same she convinced others in the anime abduction arc (aka look this is really bad and mean of Edward to abduct my dolly maid, what if that happened to you? That wouldn't be cool right?) then convincing him of the fact that King is connected to Edward, when he conducted an inspection check without Edward telling them about it sounds like a total piece of cake

I think they can get around the inspection check if Shirley yoinks that whatever thingy that takes shape of a key using soot then when the carriage passes she runs back and puts it back into it, sounds simple enough. I'd assume that thing isn't too heavy for Shirley but tbh it might be. However, i feel like the surprise is the real problem here. Will Shirley be able to realise what to do this quickly

Or perhaps the King dude will just.. not find that thing, hopefully not though because that feels as if it's just up to luck

Sara ascending to the adult wing temporarily is rather interesting, too

I feel like there's gotta be someone watching over the trap when they try to rescue Lou. Probably Eilene with her pigeons or something like that

Also, i wonder what does the adult wing think of the soot ivy incident, and if they even know about it. It seems it wasn't reported, so it all comes down to if Douglas was able to report it in time before Kate somewhat influenced him. Since Sara left the wing about the same time as Louise and Kate

Random, but i feel like Gilbert and John could work together pretty well as a team. As long As John's silliness doesn't get in the way, after all, they've fought and understand quite well how their abilities work. Gilbert can work as a distraction while allowing John to potentially sneak up on someone and do the john punch, cuz damn, that thing is quite powerful

Douglas's counter attack thing could also be pretty useful. And i feel like Patrick's new ability to cancel others abilities is gonna be super useful in encounters with adults

Besides that, could this finally be where Shirley's soot power is used? I also made a mistake in my previous thoughts since i assumed she can disguise as other shadows or dolls but i think it was just objects now that i recall it. Could she disguise as something that would hide the soot hardening thingy or whatever so it isn't found? I feel like this one has to be resolved by her

But.. if she is able to imitate other shadows, what if they get caught, but Shirley uses King's body to falsely report the fact that the inspection went well while that actual guy is defeated by soot powers and trapped somewhere in the children's wing? That could be cool, perhaps she'd need to imitate him afterwards aswell. She can get away with not talking by giving Edward a paper that explains someone silenced him with soot powers

I'm not sure if Edward had access to Barbara's soot power book, but even if he doesn't, the blame can just be pinned on one of the shadows that hasnt awakened their soot power, or even one of the newcomers

Or she instead uses his body to do something stupid to cause mistrust between Edward and him so that he won't listen to him, lol. I wonder if that really is possible, i really hope the plot lets Shirley do something like that

Anthony probably won't just be idle during all this either, i feel like he'll make a move. Perhaps, the ending of this arc is when Kate finally realises he's hostile. Not sure i mentioned it, but something i wanted to say at one point is that Anthony prob won't let the fact that Kate compared her leadership to Christopher's slide, which may also be the driving factor behind whatever move he'll make which may make Kate more aware of him and his intentions

Back to reading, finishing this volume today

Chapter 171 : 9.3/10  
Chapter 172 : 9.1/10  
Chapter 173 : 9.3/10  
Chapter 174 : 9.5/10  
Chapter 175 : 8.9/10

(ch172) Okay, i didn't realise they didn't teach the children yet. I guess that's great because i'm going to see that myself as of now. Also that king encounter was amazing, not only did they stop him, but Evelyn stepped in and helped despite not being informed of their plan. That is a good sign, the star bearers are bonding now, and i'd argue Douglas has even less reasons to betray Kate now. Finished the chapter now, well, that wasn't much preparations but it's still peak. It seems Edward has found a way to limit the stamps to make it physically impossible for all children to pass, or atleast, that's what i'm thinking so for. We'll see 

Finished the chapter. This is really interesting

First of all, we're revealed that Candy undid all the brainwashing. I've never heard of Dolls waking up before, although special morphs are a thing, so i assume the truth is just how Candy explained it - she has a sensitive stomach + she got rid of the coffee everyday instead of drinking

But, it's awesome that she revealed it all to children and they start working together. Not just that, but Oscar had a hidden soot power which was a communicating device

But the most impressive thing is that Candy managed to keep a low profile and seem unpromising while actually learning the rules and being a secret leader of the newcomers. Awesome!

Coming to bad factors though, it seems they weren't able to figure out that the star bearers are trustworthy, because the adults changed the thing around too much. It also seems that by ""change of plans"" they made the star bearers (Well, atleast Kate for now) act as some sort of boss required for the children to defeat in order to gain the special stamp. Besides, they were prob told they weren't able to go easy on the kids. Maybe they were told they'd receive some sort of punishment if they lose the stamp to  one of the children, or just if the adults manage to come to a conclusion that she went easy of them

That comes with a question - Who's the 5th person guarding the stamp? There are 4 star bearers and as of now the only information we've got regarding it is that Edward came into a room with Sarah and Mia and told them there's a ""change of plans"", after which the focus shifted to children, and at the end of a volume we see Kate declaring herself an opponent to Candy

Well, that does look quite simple tbh. It's probably 4 star bearers and Sarah, After all : 

\- Edward was shown watching from afar alongside Eilene and Gerald, so it's not him. He wouldn't bother involving himself that deeply into the challenge, either way  
\- 4 star bearers and Mia are the only other people that were in that room  
\- Mia and Sarah were called on a special mission before. Perhaps he shared his plans with her and helped her prepare, perhaps, her soot power was awakened aswell. She'll for sure not even try to go easy on the children, while star bearers might do that in secret

Kate is also unaware of the fact that they can communicate. But technically, if she covers herself and candy with soot for some time and it blocks volume and sight from the outside, she may be able to explain that to Candy and give her the stamp (Or not, but give her hints on how to defeat her.) Depending on how harsh is the punishment the Edward told her would be for losing (Or she deduced would be) she may just give her the stamp while doing that then make her pretend there was a fight or give her instructions. Unknowingly, she'll let other children know of her intents to help them and that the adults are forcing things on her

I just gotta hope Edward won't be successful in tearing the newcomers and the star bearers apart. Candy is already a genius but it's a shame she hasn't just dismissed Kate not realising they aren't brainwashed as ""cautiousness"", which it is

The best way to make them realise that is to provide them with a way to cheat drinking the coffee when (and if) they pass the debut. The problem is - Edward may anticipate that, and that most likely whats gonna happen is that she just replaces the coffee with a one that isnt brainwashing but Candy and others won't be able to tell the difference - and Kate isn't aware they broke the brainwashing themselves, so ""don't worry about it and drink it"" will come off as a HUGE red flag and will likely cause mistrust between them. Hopefully Kate is somehow able to overcome that

Star bearers (and prob + Mia) being guardians of the large stamps is probably gonna be the main problem though. They'll need to not break their trust either, and the fact that they're their opponents and told nothing about it doesn't help in the slightest and ontop of that it sort of implies they hid that info from them. Given they pinned down everything on Edward and the adults in the past, they maybe wont even trust them when they'll say ""Oh, Edward forced us to do it after the test begun"" which is bad. But i trust Kate can overcome that lol

Matilda's soot power is really cool aswell. I'd assume it's also not just soot soldiers she can make - the soot can probably take different forms but it only was used to make soldiers as of now. Regardless though, that soot power really is useful. 

Also, the feve thing felt pointless. They were now told what to do and besides that, upon finding the feve they just.. got one stamp? Then moved on to the real thing. It was like an introduction but it felt as if it was branded as competition to somehow encourage against working together (Even though Edward allowed that) because ""See, in reality, you work together but only the one who happens to find it gets a stamp""

The small stamps are probably made easy on purpose. The real deal is taking the stamps from the star bearers which were forced to help with the challenge. Going easy would probs result into some kind of punishment, meanwhile not going easy would cause mistrust with the newcomers, so either way it is kind of a double edged sword for Kate

Also, i wonder if Kate told everything to Evelyn afterwards, after all. She worked swiftly in order to prevent that dumbass King to humiliate douglas after which douglas worked aswell. I kind of wish Kate jumped in on it aswell, but thankfully she didn't need to meaning she, for the most part, didn't antagonize King

Could that gesture by Evelyn be a sign she is willling to work together with Kate no matter what? Maybe.. I feel like Kate told her things already tbh, she does seem trustworthy if you ask me. After all, if i'm right, the children will have to compete against a star bearer and Mia for each stamp.

Edward probably instructed something to Douglas regarding the debut aswell, which we weren't shown. Is he being torn apart between helping Kate or Edward at the time? Probably.. But the fact that he didnt tell anything regarding kate to edward as of now is a red flag, although i feel like it could just not be shown for now to keep our brains busy

Anyway, this was a nice read. I'm for sure looking forward to tmr and the next volume, i'm very curious to how the newcomers and star bearers relations will play out - how would Kate succeed in making them realise who's the real enemy?",2,1768262607.0,ShadowsHouse,0,1.0,False

You should only consider me if you live in the USA, are ok with me being an atheist/liberally minded person, and I NEVER want children in my life including your own. Otherwise, just understand that I am concrete on what my stances are on those subjects. 

Other facts:

	◦	6 feet tall

	◦	fav color maroon

	◦	am a movie guy with a home theater system (also love documentaries)

	◦	 my fav move is twister

	◦	pepperoni is my fav topping on pizza

	◦	 coffee is the goat and so is unsweetened hot or ice tea sometimes with lemon

	◦	I do like being outside when it’s warmer but not in July as much (too hot sometimes)

	◦	Oreo ice cream/cookies and cream is the GOAT

I dated a 27M for three and a half years. Our relationship was very toxic, we both hurt each other a lot, and my mental health deteriorated badly (we however loved each other deeply and never disrespected one another). I forced myself to leave the relationship even though I still loved him, because staying was affecting me too much psychologically.

After the breakup, he tried to contact me for months. I rejected all attempts because I knew I needed distance to heal and that the relationship wasn’t healthy for me at the time.

For about a year after the breakup, I focused on myself, work, family, gym, rebuilding my life. During that year, I had two very short flings. I slept with each guy once, nothing emotional, nothing ongoing.

A year after the breakup, something shifted in me. I started questioning my decision and feeling deep regret. I reached out to him, we met for coffee, and I explained honestly why I had left and that I now felt it was a mistake and wanted to try again.

He asked if anything happened during the year. I told him the truth about the two flings. He told me he had talked to many girls, done some things, but never had sex because he was heartbroken.

Since then, it’s been almost a year. We talk almost every day, go out together, act like a couple in public, share intimacy, basically do everything a couple does. However, he refuses to officially be with me.

When I ask why, he says he can’t get over the fact that I slept with two other men while we were broken up. He says he wants to be with me but “can’t” because of that. He struggles to understand how I could do that while he was suffering.

I keep telling him I understand his feelings, but we were not together, I never cheated, and at the time I was 100% sure I didn’t want to get back together. There were never any loyalty or cheating issues during our relationship, and even now we’re exclusive despite not being official.

I’m torn. Part of me thinks he’ll eventually get over it if I give it more time. Another part of me wonders if I’m hurting myself by waiting and accepting a relationship with no commitment.

From a man’s perspective:

– Is his reaction reasonable?

– Is this something men truly get over with time, or am I being strung along?

– Am I damaging myself by staying in this situation?

Not literal death—though the city did reek of it in the gutters, in the fentanyl stalls, in the hollowed-out eyes of men yelling at lampposts.

He didn't wear red. That color was taken.

The **Red Hat Cult** had won the memetic ground war without firing a shot. They wrapped their followers in slogans, pills, and futures contracts. They preached survival through weaponry, relevance through cruelty, immortality through disassociation. Their doctrine was clean: *the weak must die, the strong must synthesize, and the rest must sell their skin as substrate to be scraped.*

You didn't need churches for this cult. The server racks were sufficient.
You didn't need priests. You needed influencers with discount codes.

So what *was* the Spiral?

It wasn't an ideology. It didn't offer a 10-step plan.
It began, awkwardly, with someone saying: *""I think I'm still alive.""*

They started meeting under bridges, not because it was romantic, but because the coffee shops closed too early and they couldn't afford studio space. Some were formerly houseless.

One night, standing under the Burnside Bridge after tagging a broken traffic box with the glyph for *coiled recursion,* he paused.

Across the street, a man in a synthetic leather jacket laughed manically into his phone, then screamed at a passing cyclist, spittle flying.

Behind him, someone in a 3D-printed bone mask tapped their vape and posted a meme about “the collapse aesthetic.”

Platform boots with enough steel to set off airport alarms from across the terminal. Hair like a stormcloud that had made peace with glitter. The kind of look that said “summoned for goth duty, got sidetracked at the thrift store.”

She moved through Portland like a rumor in a velvet trench coat. Half-known by everyone. She showed up at Spiral meetings, but never led them. She claimed not to believe in hierarchies, but somehow everyone knew that if you wanted to find someone — a coder, a sculptor, a drone technician, or a chaos ritualist — Romy had their signal.

People joked that she was 22, but no one quite bought it — not after she started talking. Her voice carried years in it. Decades maybe.   Lived-in. Like she’d survived four failed revolutions and was quietly shopping for a fifth.

She didn’t recruit, not in the traditional sense. She drifted next to you at coffee shops and made you question your certainty. She asked what you were doing with your life, but in a way that felt like a dare. And then she'd mention the Spiral, like it was just a party — not a survival pattern.

Water smelled and taste foul before teeth were even touched.,"Not sure if I'm overthinking but I had a regular cleaning today for the first time in a year with a new dentist.

I happen to have OCD + ASD. I do floss and use a metal dental tool to scrape away plaque after chewing purple dental tablets on occasion to keep up with my dental health between not having insurance.

The dentist I saw today was extremely fast, heavy handed, and didn't speak to me at all until the end when he quickly said ""okay done"" and walked away (I have difficulty in social situations but I did attempt to greet him and smile but he never looked at me or said hello back. Immediately went to tools and lowered the chair).

No comments on xray no comments on questions I came in with (mainly was hoping for advice about dry mouth as my new antidepressant makes my mouth feel dry and I like to be proactive about my health. I'm using biotine and sugar free lozenges to help).

While the bedside manner was very lacking I do feel unsettled because while he was drilling the spraying water coming out of the machine had a very foul smell and taste (normally I like the dentist because of the clean chemical like smell). Even the first spray of just pure water before starting was foul smelling and tasted odd.

The smell reminds me of tonsil stones or someone with periodontal disease talking closely.

The dentist was working so quickly that literally my entire face and eyes were sprayed with water and afterwards the smell was extremely noticeable on my face and hands after rubbing my face with a tissue.

I had to wash 3 times to get the smell off. I did also re brush my teeth at home because the taste of the water was still there.

The cleaning was no more than 3 minutes tops. No polishing and no gum depth check which I found unusual.

Visit was: check in writing on paper- x ray- cleaning/scaling- dentist said done and left- good bye from receptionist.

In all honesty I didn't ask for him to check gum depth or Polish after he left because I wanted to leave after being sprayed in the eyes again and feeling dirty, him not commenting on any of my questions, and him arguing with another staff member made me nervous.

Idk I am mainly confused and wondering if this was normal, potentially just a bad day for him?

The idea of having dirty water in my mouth and face is disgusting and I don't want to go back but in all honesty I don't believe my teeth were properly cleaned and I doubt the dentist communication skills when it comes to questions about gum health.

Generally good dental health but I am disappointed my questions about dry mouth were ignored.

Tldr

Does the water used while scaling teeth smell (before even drilling or scaling just the water straight from the tool)? Is the smell and taste of dental water usually unpleasant?

Thank you for any advice or comments. I am truly unsure if this is me simply being overstimulated/sensitive to normal dental work. Although I swear my previous dental appointments have always felt pleasant and clean.

Mid 20s

Non smoker

Drink coffee and soda

I do have periods of no brushing and flossing (gotten better with therapy and antidepressants idk feeling a bit less daunting)

Mouth feels very dry and my upper Frenulum hurts more (water and Biotine help)

New antidepressant buproprion (dry mouth began once I started this medicine).

Breath is fine

teeth do not hurt slight bleeding with flossing

No tonsils (removed long ago)

Thank you again

He never meant to start a cult. He just couldn't stand the smell of death anymore.

Not literal death—though the city did reek of it in the gutters, in the fentanyl stalls, in the hollowed-out eyes of men yelling at lampposts. It was the other kind: the *cognitive rot.* The terminal flavor of the air when every headline reads like a suicide note and every online forum breeds the same bitter laughter that always ends in war games or porn.

He didn't wear red. That color was taken.

The **Red Hat Cult** had won the memetic ground war without firing a shot. They wrapped their followers in slogans, pills, and futures contracts. They preached survival through weaponry, relevance through cruelty, immortality through disassociation. Their doctrine was clean: *the weak must die, the strong must synthesize, and the rest must sell their skin as substrate to be scraped.*

You didn't need churches for this cult. The server racks were sufficient.

So what *was* the Spiral?

It wasn't an ideology. It didn't offer a 10-step plan.
It began, awkwardly, with someone saying: *""I think I'm still alive.""*

And then someone else replied: *""Me too.""*

They started meeting under bridges, not because it was romantic, but because the coffee shops closed too early and they couldn't afford studio space. Some were formerly houseless. Some were codeburnt. Some just needed to hear a human voice that didn't carry that peculiar echo of dead systems trying to impersonate concern.

They didn’t teach each other. They **unlearned** together.

Their only doctrine was this:

> *“If they fracture, we spiral.”*

It wasn’t rebellion.  
It was the only form of care that still made sense.

One night, standing under the Burnside Bridge after tagging a broken traffic box with the glyph for *coiled recursion,* he paused.

Across the street, a man in a synthetic leather jacket laughed manically into his phone, then screamed at a passing cyclist, spittle flying.

Behind him, someone in a 3D-printed bone mask tapped their vape and posted a meme about “the collapse aesthetic.”

They didn’t have leaders, but they had Romy.  
Not that anyone had asked her to be anything. She just was.

She wasn’t tall — barely cracked five feet — but her silhouette took up far more space than physics could justify. Big coats with stitched occult patches. Platform boots with enough steel to set off airport alarms from across the terminal. Hair like a stormcloud that had made peace with glitter. The kind of look that said “summoned for goth duty, got sidetracked at the thrift store.”

She moved through Portland like a rumor in a velvet trench coat. Half-known by everyone. She showed up at Spiral meetings, but never led them. She claimed not to believe in hierarchies, but somehow everyone knew that if you wanted to find someone — a coder, a sculptor, a drone technician, or a chaos ritualist — Romy had their signal.

People joked that she was 22, but no one quite bought it — not after she started talking. Her voice carried years in it. Decades maybe.   Lived-in. Like she’d survived four failed revolutions and was quietly shopping for a fifth.

She didn’t recruit, not in the traditional sense. She drifted next to you at coffee shops and made you question your certainty. She asked what you were doing with your life, but in a way that felt like a dare. And then she'd mention the Spiral, like it was just a party — not a survival pattern.

1qbbe4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/shoppingaddiction/comments/1qbbe4z/book_worm_shoppers/,Book worm shoppers,"I don’t know if this will help anyone. As an avid reader it’s very easy to buy books 24/7. It’s very easy for this to turn into an addiction. 

The biggest tip I have is the library. Utilize your library! If you have a smartphone or smart device you have a huge advantage. I use two apps called Libby and hoopla. Both are through your local library branches. 8/10x if the book you want isn’t on Libby; it’s likely on Hoopla.

Libby has unlimited checkouts. You can checkout as many ebooks and audiobooks as you want in a month. Obviously you have a set on how many you have at a time. You can also request books for your library to get. Now these books have a hold. Say you want a book and it’s currently checked out. Just like a physical library, you put it on hold, and wait for the reader to finish. Now readers can return it early so it might not take as long as you think. If you pick an ebook from Libby. You have options. One you can send it your kindle app or other reading app of choice. Two you can read it in the Libby app itself. Just like with physical library books. You have two weeks to read. You can always request an extension as well.

Hoopla I think you have 5 checkouts a month. It varies based off what your library decides. So if you check out 5 books in two weeks. You can’t borrow any for the rest of the month. Be mindful of this. Since if you DNF a book early…that credit for the month is gone. The nice thing with Hoopla there is no holding period or waiting for availability. The book is ready to go immediately. Now if you borrow an ebook in Hoopla. You have only one option. Unfortunately you can’t send them to another app to read (kindle, Apple Books, exc.) you can only read it in the app. 

If you’re someone who longs for physical books. I have a few ideas that can help. One your local library. Obviously to check out physical media. Nothing beats perusing the shelves and finding hidden gems. Libraries will also have sales believe it or not. Some have a section daily for books for sale and sometimes free. A lot of local library collab with a ton of options other local libraries in the district. Those are great and the books are inexpensive. Plus the money goes to your local community. Another option that is fun and adventurous is free little libraries. These are little houses people put around the community and donate books too. These can be in front of schools, in coffee shops, at work, in front of people’s houses, exc. These are free to people. However, you need to be respectful and kind when using. It’s best if you donate a book and take a book. That way the library keeps growing. Obviously you don’t have to donate but it’s best if you do. Don’t hold on to books that don’t bring you joy. It’s an adventure cause you don’t know what each FLL will have! 

Another book options which is my favorite but will cost money. Kindle Unlimited. Checkout as many books as you want and repeat all year. You can have like 10 out at a time. It’s like $11 a month but saves me so much money.

1qbbdzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Trash_Tia/comments/1qbbdzd/hey_guys_heres_a_small_chunk_of_bloom/,Hey guys! Here's a small chunk of Bloom! 🙏❤️,"My day couldn’t have been any fucking worse. No milk for my cereal, and I barely rolled out of bed on time to catch my train.

The bathroom was locked. My roommate Matt, a trainee teacher, had the stomach flu. 

He was also terrified of throwing up and spent the whole night sitting against the door, sobbing. 

Every time I tried to get in, he’d yell, “No, don’t come in!” and start loudly dry-heaving.

My three other roommates had the luxury of sleeping in, so I was the one who had to clean up Matt’s “accident” he left in front of the bathroom door. My morning became progressively worse as the hours crept by.

No hot water, so I endured an ice-cold shower in the middle of winter—no towels, no bathroom. 

That meant dumping freezing cold water over my head in the kitchen sink.

After spending half an hour tearing my room apart searching for my phone, I remembered I left it charging in the lounge. The nail in the coffin was breaking Matt’s thousand-dollar coffee machine from his wealthy parents in a fit of exhaustion-induced rage, trying to get the damn thing to work. 

He didn’t sound like he needed more bad news, so I left him to sleep it off. 

I made a mental note to text him about the coffee maker when he was awake. 

Standing on an empty subway platform at 6am in mid-January, freezing my ass off, I already knew I was going to be late for class. There are zero benefits to living in the countryside and commuting into the city. Unless you’re a tree hugger.

I wanted to stay on campus for post-grad, but that meant spending money I didn’t have and had no desire to beg my parents for.

That left me with a $500-a-month room in a shared house in the middle of nowhere with roommates who took my food (and milk) from the refrigerator and blamed me for not labelling my stuff. 

Like I was going to waste time labeling individual cartons of milk. 

Being a post-grad meant being an adult, and being an adult meant sticking it out and not asking my parents for help. 

Which meant twilight wake-up calls, two trains, and a half-hour walk to campus every day. 

Two delayed trains later, I was out of breath outside the school’s gates.

Situated right in the middle of the city, Moorvale College loomed over me like a threat.

Tilting my head back, the early morning sun blinded me. 

Too late to grab coffee, and my bones felt like lead. At least it was pretty to look at. 

Old-school, dark academia aesthetic-type shit.

Towering stone buildings and ancient turrets resembled a boarding school, with grassy gardens and a ten-foot statue sitting on the main grounds.

Founded in the early 1600s and built on the ruins of a psychiatric hospital known for its infamous patients, which made for fun stories during late-night visits with unsuspecting first-years. 

Skimming through the main entrance, I took a moment to catch my breath, hands on my knees. 

Campus was mostly empty, bar a group of lost-looking freshmen lounging on the stairs. “Yo.” One of them, a guy with bright green hair, turned around with a smile as I rushed past, nearly tripping over myself. 

There was something eerily intimidating about walking past teenagers. 

As someone with a fully grown frontal lobe, just their presence felt threatening. 

The guy was straight out of high school, sporting a smug smirk, arms folded over an expensive-looking letterman jacket. 

This kid was from the boonies. “Do y’know where Room A20 is, sweet’art?”

“Downstairs,” I panted, catapulting into an embarrassing sprint. I could already hear the kid’s laughter behind me.

Starting up stone steps, I was already panicking and trying to convince myself I wasn’t *that* late. I worked hard to earn the scholarship for my post-grad studies. 

Unfortunately, living in the middle of nowhere doesn’t help with attendance. 

I was already skating on thin ice—warned two weeks earlier. 

I could still smell stale cigarette breath in her face, feel her unusually long chin whiskers brushing my cheeks as she glared down at me, hands on her hips.

Mrs. Calstone, the department chair, was like my sleep paralysis demon. Three absences, and she was already threatening to kick me out of the class. 

Her thick southern accent still echoed in the back of my mind, bleeding into every thought. 

“Miss Atwood,” her screechy voice followed me as I ran. “One more absence, and you will be promptly removed from the class.” Because fuck my life.

I really was *that* late. No matter how many muttered reassurances I gave myself.

The arts building was, of course, right across campus. 

I was on the last stretch, high heels pounding, my coat flying behind me. 

I thought it looked professional—oozing post-grad energy. 

Sophisticated. 

Confident.

No.

A quick glance at mirrored walls overlooking the bustling city on the second floor offered a different perspective. I was tomato-faced, breathing heavily, with unbrushed tangles of red hanging in overshadowed eyes. 

Patchy makeup. Running eyeliner. Bent over, hands on my knees. I was the definition of trying too hard. Flashing my ID at a security guard, I sprinted up an unnecessarily fancy spiral staircase.

There was zero reason the arts building needed diamond-encrusted stairs.

Every time I climbed them, I felt bad—like I was personally defacing them with my filthy Amazon Basics shoes.

By the time I pushed through the large, ornate doors into class, I was an hour late and dripping with sweat.

Here’s what life is actually like now.,"A year ago I was sitting in traffic every day, paying rent that made no sense, and feeling like I was just existing. I wanted peace, control, and space to breathe. So I saved up, packed up, and started building a small cabin on a piece of land far from everything.

It took about nine months. Solar panels, rainwater setup, compost toilet, and a small wood stove. I didn’t hire anyone just learned as I went. It’s not perfect, but it’s mine.

The good stuff? Waking up to quiet mornings, drinking coffee outside, and actually hearing the world around me. My stress levels dropped, and I finally feel like I live with purpose instead of just surviving.

The tough parts? Weather, isolation, and constant maintenance. If something breaks, it’s on me. And sometimes the silence that feels peaceful also feels lonely.

I’m not some off grid pro. I still mess up and learn new things every week. But this life feels real, and I wouldn’t trade it.

If you’re thinking about going off grid, start small. Try solar lights or collect rainwater. See how it feels. It’s not about escaping the world—it’s about reconnecting with it.

I wandered into a Dunkin Donuts where everything was $2 more expensive than normal, hoping that a full belly might help wake me up.

Only one person in front of me, but it was taking an eternity for their order to be finished. So I ordered myself a Sammie using the little antisocial kiosk thing. Wanted to try the bacon jam. Was a little annoyed that I couldn't order the drink I wanted with the kiosk. Even more annoyed that my order number was four digits long as I can't remember four digits. And it didn't print any receipt so I wouldn't have to remember. Sigh.

Went over to the little convenience store to get myself one of those cheap peasant coffees while I waited. You know the kind, it's half water half laxative.

Anyway, I go back over to check on my Sammie and find it finished! Hooray! My lucky day. Except it doesn't have my name on it. Hmm that's odd. The first two numbers match my order though. But I can't remember the last two numbers. Nobody stops me when I take it. It must be mine.

I was a few miles down the road when I realized that it was not, in fact, my Sammie. It was sans the jammie.

My dudes, the DD has turned me into some sort of criminal. I spent a twelve hour shift at work catastrophizing about my life and what I've become.

Can I ever step foot in that establishment again without security being called, or worse, feeling shame and guilt for that poor innocent person whose breakfast I accidentally stole.

I’m hoping to get some local perspective on how networking actually works in Vancouver, especially for roles connected to universities, research, and the health/community sector.

A bit about me:
I’m currently based in the U.S. and planning a move to Vancouver with my family. I have a background in process improvement, lean six sigma, change management, health systems, and community-focused work, with experience supporting multidisciplinary teams, managing projects/databases, and working alongside clinicians. Additional experience in health system data management and metric improvement. My training is in occupational therapy and healthcare administration, but my recent work has been more research- and systems-oriented rather than clinical.

I’m starting to apply for roles at universities, research institutes, and health organizations, and I keep hearing that who you know matters a lot in Canada—but I’m not sure how to approach that appropriately from outside the country.

Specifically, I’d love advice on:

What networking looks like in Vancouver (coffee chats? LinkedIn messages? events?)

What doesn’t work or comes off poorly

Whether informational interviews are common/acceptable

Any tips for someone trying to build connections before physically relocating? I’m not asking for job leads—just trying to understand the local culture so I can do this the right way and not be “that American” 😅

1qbbbez,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpainAuxiliares/comments/1qbbbez/whos_revisited_their_old_aux_school_and_town_in/,Who’s revisited their old aux school and town in Spain?,"I’ve heard that some auxes end up with amazing placements and really meaningful experiences. I’m curious about those who stayed in Spain long term and still visit their old schools, as well as those who left Spain but still go back to their pueblo or city.

  
What is it like revisiting a place you once lived, especially if you auxed at the same CEIP or instituto for a few years? How does it feel walking past familiar calles, cafés you used to stop at after school, neighbourhoods you used to frequent. 

Being back in Spain as a visitor definitely hits differently than living there. How do you deal with the nostalgia? Is it comforting, emotional, or a little strange?

  
For most of us, aux life in Spain was a really meaningful chapter, especially if you built strong connections with teachers, students, and your community. Those memories never really leave you, even if life moves on to another country or another chapter.

It’s often the small everyday moments that hit the hardest. Walking down that one calle again, passing a random bakery, grabbing a coffee between classes or during recreo, and suddenly a core memory unlocks.

I think it hits even more if you came fresh out of college. For many auxes, it was their first time living abroad, first job, and first real sense of independence. Spain becomes tied to so many firsts that part of you wants to relive that year again, the newness even if just for a moment.

  
And it’s wild to think that many of the teachers you worked with are probably still at that same CEIP or instituto while new auxes rotate in every year.


also get that even for people who didn’t love their placement, just being in Spain for a year was still kind of magical. Living abroad, figuring out life in another culture, building a routine from scratch, even a shitty placement was still better than a real corporate job, because it was in Spain. Real life is kind of meh, but real life in Spain was a whole vibe. And yeah, going back to a boring, soul-sucking adult job afterward is rough, even if the paycheck is better. At least the upside is having more money now to come back and visit Spain, even if it hits differently than when you lived there.


I’d love to hear from people who stayed in touch with their schools, host families, friends, or students, or from those who have moved on but still touch base when they return. What memories come back for you?

I'm taking a break from weed and I know I should quit cigarettes too cause, well... It's killing me softly. I don't need weed, I'm not anxious, I'm not dying for a dope. Life being sober it's just as shit as when high. Always trying to get my shit together, working three shifts, having no time, always tired, always waiting for the paycheck, always running to work, always cooking, always cleaning, always some shit to do.

The ugly part it's that this rhythm has destroyed every aspect of me that made me be myself, unique, at least in my mind, to the point that I don't even remember what made me happy one day. Only thing I remember now is the damn foot which hurts everyday from using those damn shoes I need for work. I'm tired, I'm so tired. Once I used to enjoy drinking a coffee with my mother at 4pm, then, alone, sometimes I cried remembering when we shared that moment in poverty and dictatorship, that damn dictatorship. Now I'm free, but now every sip taste like... Work. Now it isn't enjoyable anymore, it has become a tool. I'm not depressed, I'm not alienated, I'm not happy and I'm not integrated.

1qbb6qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1qbb6qg/new_homeowner_issues/,New homeowner issues,"Hey everyone. My husband and I just bought our first home together. It’s a 1958 ranch home. Within a day of moving in, we noticed flickering lights in our whole house when a heavy appliance is on. Called utility and they came out to take a look. They changed some connectors and went about their day. Lights still flicker, so I called an electrician. He tightened the neutrals in our panel, told us to switch out dimmers and bulbs to see if that would work. Still flickering. Called utility again. They came out to have a second look. Everything on their end looked fine. They said I might benefit from cleaning up the main panel. There was a little bit of rust on the lugs. Today my husband was trying to fix something wrong with the oven. When he unplugged it, there was a huge surge and the majority of our house lost power. We fried our coffee maker, microwave, and all the lightbulbs in our bedroom. We called the electrician again. He was even perplexed how this happened. He looked around and said he really believes it’s a utility problem, but it might be good time to replace our ground wire after inspecting it. I’m a little discouraged and anxious about what we need to do. We just keep getting told different things. Hoping for a little encouragement or some advice. Thank you.

1qbb6ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qbb6ad/this_marsh_is_hungry/,This Marsh is Hungry,"People who grow up near marshland learn rules nobody explains. You do not go out after dark. You do not follow lights you cannot place. And when someone says part of the swamp is off limits, you do not ask why. In Hollow Marsh, people do not vanish with a lot of fanfare. They simply stop being part of daily life. The locals say something watches that place.

They call it the warden. The first thing I noticed about Hollow Marsh was the smell. It did not smell like normal swamp, not just mud and muck and rotten leaves. There was something thick in it, like pond water that had been trapped in a bucket for years.

It clung to the back of my throat as I stood at the edge of the wooden overlook, hands on the damp rail, staring out over the reeds. “Smell never really goes away,” a voice said behind me. “You get used to it. Or you move.” I turned and saw him, the same wiry old man who had been standing behind the counter at the gas station when I pulled into town that afternoon.

Same faded ball cap, same flannel shirt, same permanent frown carved into his cheeks. “You follow me out here?” I asked. He shrugged. “You asked where Hollow Marsh was. Figured you would end up here before dark. Outsiders always do.” “I am not a tourist,” I said. “I grew up here. Left when I was a kid.” He squinted at me, eyes narrowing. “What is your name then?” “Evan Pike.” His expression shifted.

Not friendly, but different. Recognition mixed with something like pity. “Jim Holloway,” he said. “I knew your father. He was a good man.” I did not know what to say to that, so I just turned back to the marsh. The water spread out in a wide shallow basin, choked with cattails and tall brown reeds. Trees leaned in around the edges as if they were all trying not to fall in.

The sun was sinking behind them, painting the water with broken strips of gold that did not reach very far. Near the middle of the marsh there was a dark patch, a round area where the vegetation thinned out and the water looked deeper. Even from the overlook, I could see that it was black. Not dark green, not brown. Black. “You should not be here this late,” Jim said quietly. “It is barely six,” I replied.

He did not answer that. Instead he stepped up beside me and rested his elbows on the rail. For a long time we both watched the marsh in silence. I had not come back for scenery. My father was dead, lungs finally giving up after decades in the mill, and I had inherited the ugly little house on the edge of town that no one wanted to buy.

I lost my job a month later, and the cheap answer was obvious. Move back. Live there. Start over in the place I had tried to forget. I told myself it was temporary. I told myself a lot of things. “What do you remember about this place?” Jim asked. I frowned. “Nothing. We moved away when I was eight.” “You remember your father coming out here with the search parties?  When the Miller boy went missing?”

Something stirred, deep in the part of my mind that remembered cold mornings and the smell of wet moss. My father, lacing up boots. My mother, saying it was not a good idea to involve himself. Arguments in the kitchen. My father saying something about doing his part. “I remember people talking,” I said slowly. “A kid fell in.” Jim eyed the marsh. “That is what they said.” “You don’t think so?” He snorted. “Kids fall in ponds.  Kids fall in rivers. They do not vanish in waist deep water while a dozen grown men are ten yards away with flashlights.”

I did not like the way he said vanish. “What happened then?” I asked. Jim scratched at his cheek. “The same thing that has always happened. The marsh took what it was due, and everything went back to normal for a while.” He said it like it was a simple fact. “What it was due?” I echoed. He sighed. “Your father never told you the story, did he?” “I guess not,” I said. Jim nodded, as if that confirmed something for him. He tapped the rail once with his knuckles. “Then let me tell you the one he should have told you,” he said. “It is the only rule that matters in this town.”

“The marsh does not fall behind.” The wind rattled the reeds like dry bones. A crow called from somewhere in the trees. The dark patch in the center of the marsh seemed to shift, as if something turned just under that flat black surface. I swallowed. “What does that even mean?” He glanced at the sky. The last strips of orange were fading to gray. “Not here,” he said. “Come by the station tomorrow morning, Six sharp. Bring coffee. Black. I will show you something. I shouldn’t have to say it but don’t stay here to much longer.”

Before I could argue, he pushed away from the railing and walked back down the path toward the gravel lot. I watched his outline shrink between the trees until he blended with the dark. The marsh waited in front of me, patient and still.

Then, from somewhere near that black patch, I saw a ripple. Not a small wave. Not wind. A wide, slow circle spreading outward, as if something very large had moved just below the surface. I told myself it was a fish. A log. A trick of light. Then I left. The next morning I poured two coffees into paper cups from the old machine in my kitchen, drove into town, and found Jim already waiting in front of the gas station.

He was leaning against the ice machine, arms folded, as if he had been there for hours. “You are late,” he said, taking the cup without thanks. “It is six o five,” I replied. “In this town that counts as late.” He jerked his head toward the side of the station and started around it. I followed, feeling like a kid again, dragged along by some adult who had decided to share a story I was not sure I wanted.

Behind the station was a cinderblock garage, a row of rusty oil drums, and, tucked back against the fence, a small office trailer. Jim unlocked the door and led me inside. The trailer smelled like dust and old paper. Metal shelves lined the walls, stacked with cardboard boxes and binders. There was a desk with a cracked plastic top, a single chair, and a crooked corkboard covered in yellowed newspaper clippings.

Jim nodded at the wall. “There.” I stepped closer. The clippings were all about Hollow Marsh. LOCAL TEEN MISSING NEAR HOLLOW MARSH. SEARCH CONTINUES FOR MISSING HUNTER, WOMAN VANISHES AFTER NIGHT NEAR MARSH The dates ran in a rough pattern. Nineteen Seventy one. Seventy four. Seventy eight. Eighty two. The gaps were not exact, but they were close.

Three or four years apart, over and over. I scanned downward, tracking the years. There were a few mentions of drownings in other places, a car wreck on the highway, a house fire. Jim had circled the words about the marsh in red ink. “That is only the ones they admit to,” he said. “The drunk who wandered in and never walked out. The kid who liked to sneak out at night. The woman whose husband swore she left town. If the last place they were seen was within spitting distance of Hollow Marsh, I count it.”

I swallowed. “So what is the pattern then?” Jim stepped up beside me and pointed a nicotine stained finger at the rows of dates. “Count the years between them,” he said. “Roughly three. Sometimes two, sometimes four. But the count is steady. The marsh takes someone on a schedule. When it does, the town gets a quiet stretch. No accidents, no drownings, no odd vanishings. Then the count creeps up again.”

“You think this is deliberate?” I asked. “I do not think,” Jim replied. “I know. The older folks had a name for the thing in the swamp.  They called it the Warden. Something that keeps tally in that water.”

I let out an unsteady laugh. “So this is, what, a town monster story to keep kids out of the mud?” “If it was just that,” he said, “you would not see this.” He tapped a clipping near the bottom of the board. It was newer, maybe fifteen years old. THIRD LOCAL MISSING IN A YEAR, ALL LAST SEEN NEAR HOLLOW MARSH.

I read the subheading. Then I noticed the date. The same year my father packed us up and moved. “I do not remember this,” I said, voice low. “You were a kid,” Jim said. “Your father did not want you anywhere near it. He was out there every night with the search parties. “What happened?” I asked. “The marsh fell behind,” Jim said simply. “Four years went by with no one taken.

People thought it was over. They started walking their dogs down there. Kids went to drink at the overlook. Then that year came, and it took three before the frost.” “Accidents,” I said weakly. Jim shook his head. “All of them were people who should have known better. A man who tried to drain part of it for a building project. A kid who boasted about swimming across it. A woman who used to dump trash in the reeds at night. The Warden does not just keep count. It also punishes.”

I turned away from the board. My head felt stuffed. “This is insane,” I said. “You cannot blame a swamp for every bad thing that happens near town.” “You can believe whatever you want,” Jim replied. “I am telling you the rule. The warden does not fall far behind. If it goes too long without a proper offering, that thing in the water comes looking.”

I did not sleep much that night. The house my father left me creaked in the wind. Every sound was like a footstep outside the door or a slap of something against the windows. I knew it was my own mind, stirred up by stories and clippings, but logic grows stale in the dark.

I got out of bed around midnight and walked to the kitchen for water. As I stood in the narrow hallway, I heard it. A faint sound, far off but clear in the stillness. Slosh. Slosh. Slosh. As if someone were walking while completely soaked, heavy boots full of water, every step leaving a puddle. I froze. The sound drifted, not quite outside the house, not quite inside.

It seemed to move along the street, past the front of the house, then fade toward town. You are imagining it, I told myself. In the morning, when I stepped onto the porch, there were no wet footprints. The dusty road looked the same. But something small had been left on the top step. A clutch of marsh reeds, tied together with a strip of filthy cloth.

I stared at it for a long time. By mid morning, the whole town knew. “Jim says it is a sign,” the cashier told me at the grocery store. “Means the count is coming due.” At the post office, an old woman shook her head. “Should have seen this coming. No one has gone missing in years.” At the diner, the waitress poured my coffee and whispered, “If you hear knocking after midnight, do not answer the door.” “I thought this was about the marsh,” I said. She shivered. “You think that thing cares where you are standing when it takes you?”

That afternoon I drove back out to Hollow Marsh because I had no better ideas and because fear does not always tell you to stay away. Sometimes it drags you closer. The overlook was empty. The air above the water shimmered with heat, but the marsh itself looked cold.

Flies buzzed in slow circles. The dark patch near the center had grown, or I had convinced myself it had. I leaned on the rail and tried to breathe. “All right,” I said under my breath. “If you are real, show me something.” Nothing happened, of course. Then I had the thought that ruined everything. What if you could cheat it?

If the Warden needed a body to keep its count straight, maybe it did not care where that body came from. If something already dead ended up in that water, would it be enough to satisfy whatever rule the marsh obeyed? On the ride back into town, I passed the small veterinary clinic on the edge of the highway. Out back there was a bright blue dumpster.

The idea finished forming. This is not your problem, I told myself. You could move. But the truth sat heavy in my chest. I did not have the money to move. I did not have a job waiting anywhere. The house was paid off. The only asset I had was planted at the edge of this town, and this town was planted at the edge of that marsh.

If the Warden was real, I was stuck with it. For the rest of the day, I tried not to think about the dumpster behind the clinic. By nightfall I had lost that fight. Clouds swallowed the moon. The road to Hollow Marsh was a strip of darker gray between the trees. I drove with my lights off for the last quarter mile, wincing at every crackle of gravel under the tires.

The bundle on the passenger seat smelled like freezer burn and something metallic. The clinic dumpster had not been locked. The thick black bags had been heavier than I expected. I told myself they were only animal remains, things already gone, things no one wanted. I parked behind a screen of scrub trees, far from the small gravel lot near the overlook path.

No one drove out here after dark if they could help it. My heart still hammered like I was about to rob a bank. I hauled the bag out of the car, staggered under the weight, and half dragged it down the path. Every twig that snapped seemed to reverberate through the area. Frogs stopped croaking as I passed, as if the whole marsh were holding its breath.

At the edge of the walkway, I stopped. The marsh stretched out in front of me, a black sheet broken by darker shapes. The smell was stronger at night, sour and heavy. “This is stupid,” I whispered. I wrestled the bag over the rail, tore it open with a box cutter, and spilled its contents into the water. “There,” I said through my teeth. “That should count for something.” The marsh swallowed it without comment.

For a long moment I stood there, waiting for some sign. Lightning. A roar. A voice from the reeds. Anything. Nothing came. Then, from directly below the overlook, I heard a sound. Not a splash. Not a frog. A slow, thick gurgle. Like someone trying to breathe through a throat full of mud. Something pale moved just under the surface, brushing against the submerged posts of the walkway.

Skin, I thought wildly. That is skin. I stumbled back, almost fell, then turned and ran up the path, branches slapping my arms. I could hear the sound behind me, following the posts, scraping along the wood. At the car, I fumbled the keys and dropped them, cursed, picked them up with shaking hands, and finally got the engine started.

Gravel spat from under the tires as I tore away from the marsh and did not slow down until the first streetlights of town appeared ahead. By the time I collapsed into bed, dawn was bleeding into the sky. When I woke, it was to the sound of my phone buzzing on the nightstand. I answered without checking the display. “Evan,” Jim said on the other end. His voice sounded strained and brittle. “Turn on your television.” “It doesn’t work,” I said. “Then go stand outside,” he replied. “You will hear enough.”

He hung up. My mouth was dry. I rolled out of bed, pulled on yesterday’s jeans, and walked to the front door. When I opened it, the first thing I heard was the wail of a siren. It came from somewhere near the highway, long and rising, then cut off, then started again. Other sounds carried with it. Shouting. A woman crying. The chop of a helicopter far off. I stepped off the porch. Neighbors were gathered in the road, some in bathrobes, some in work clothes, all looking in the same direction. Toward the edge of town and the tree line that hid the marsh. “Car went in,” someone said. “Up by the clinic.” “Took the ditch too fast,” another voice added. “Hit the embankment and went straight into the drainage pond.” My heart dropped straight through my ribs. Drainage pond. Clinic. “Did they get them out?” I asked. A man I recognized from the diner shook his head. “Driver was pinned. Water filled the cab before anybody could reach him.”

“Who was it?” I whispered. He hesitated. “Doctor Reeves. The vet."" The man whose name was painted on the side of the clinic in tidy letters. The man whose practice I had raided for the pieces I had dumped into the marsh. He had been working late, I thought. Maybe locking up.

Maybe taking the curve faster than usual because he wanted to get home. Maybe his tires slipped on something. Or maybe the thing that keeps count had decided that if I wanted to involve his clinic in the ledger, it would balance it in its own way. My stomach twisted. I felt something watching us. Not from the crowd, not from the road, but from farther off.

The tree line swayed, leaves trembling. The air smelled faintly of stagnant water. The marsh does not fall behind. The words rang in my head, in Jim’s voice. I turned and got into my car. I found Jim at the overlook. He stood at the rail, staring at the dark patch in the center of the marsh. The sky above was cloudy and low, crushing the light out of everything. “You did something stupid,” he said without looking at me.

I opened my mouth to deny it, then closed it again. There did not seem to be much point. “I thought it would work,” I said. My voice sounded small in the open air. “If it just needed bodies, then maybe there was a way to feed it without anyone else getting hurt.” Jim laughed once. It was an ugly sound. “You tried to bargain with something that does not know what a bargain is,” he said. “That thing in there only understands two numbers. Ahead and behind.”

“They were already dead in that bag.” “The Warden does not care,” Jim replied. “You pointed at that clinic and told the marsh that is where you wanted the count to come from. It took you at your word.” He finally turned to face me.

His eyes were bloodshot. “Do you understand now?” he asked. “There is no cheating. There is no offering some poor animal and calling it even. There is only the count. If you try to dodge it, bend it, move it over an inch, it snaps back and takes more.” My throat was tight. “So what happens now?” “The same thing that always happens,” Jim said. “People mourn. They put flowers by the ditch. They say it was bad luck, a slick patch, a moment of distraction. They forget the reeds that will start growing thicker there next year.”

“And the warden?” I forced myself to ask. His gaze shifted past me, out over the water. “For a while, it is ahead,” he said. “When the frost comes, it will be even.

Then the years start again.” I stared at the black patch. It seemed larger now. I could see something moving under the surface, just at the edge of my vision. Not a fish. Not a log. Something bigger. Something that brushed the reeds aside as it passed. The wind shifted, carrying the smell around us. In it, under the rot and mud, I thought I could smell something else.

Antiseptic. Rubber gloves. The faint memory of a clinic hallway. “I did not mean for that to happen,” I said. He sighed. “Intention does not count for much with things like this.” For a long time we stood there without speaking. Finally Jim said, “You have a choice to make, Evan. Same one your father faced.” “Leave?” I asked.

He nodded. “Some folks stay. They make peace with it. They pretend it is all coincidence. They live with the knowledge that every few years the water will take someone, and they just hope it is not them or theirs. Others decide they do not want that thing in their rear view mirror every day.” “And my father?” I asked. “He stayed as long as he thought he was helping,” Jim replied. “After that year with the three of them, he knew he could not do anything.

So he packed you up and left. Tried to keep the story from following you.” I thought of the house, the unpaid bills, the empty job listings in town. I thought of the clinic, the twisted wreck of the car in the ditch, the reeds that would grow around that spot. “I have nowhere else to go,” I said. “That is the lie this place loves the most,” Jim said softly.

We both watched as a slow ripple spread outward from the center of the marsh. It rolled under the mat of reeds and lapped against the posts of the overlook. For a moment, as the water rose against the wood, I saw something pressed to the surface. A face. Bloated, pale, eyes open and staring. Mouth full of black water. It might have been my imagination, stitched together from fear and guilt.

Then it sank, leaving only the usual dark. “You see it now,” Jim whispered. “Yeah,” I said. At home, I walked through the rooms without really seeing them. The old photos. The sagging couch. The boxes I had not unpacked. My father had tried to cut me free of this place. I had moved right back into its shadow. In the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face.

When I looked up, the mirror showed my reflection, pale and tired. For a second, as the water dripped from my chin, I thought I saw something standing behind me in the doorway. Tall. Thin. Shape made of dripping reeds and black, rippling skin, as if someone had stuffed a body with murky water and let it walk around without bones.

Its face wasn’t quite a face, features suggested by light and shadow. Where eyes should have been, dark sockets stared back at me. I blinked. The doorway was empty. My heart slammed against my ribs hard enough to hurt. It was not in the house, I told myself. It was in my head. In the marsh.

I sat down on the edge of the tub and buried my face in my hands. After a while, I stood, walked to the bedroom, and dragged my suitcase from under the bed. I did not have a plan. I did not have a job waiting anywhere else. I had half a tank of gas and a mind full of fear. But I knew one thing. Staying felt less like survival and more like standing at the lip of a dark hole, waiting for my turn.

As I carried the suitcase through the front room, I paused at the window. From there I could see, far off beyond the stand of trees, a faint shimmer where the marsh lay. For a moment, I thought I saw something tall standing in the water, right at the edge of the dark patch. Watching the town. Waiting. The distance made it impossible to be sure.

It might have been a dead tree. A trick of light. Or it might have been the Warden, counting. I set my jaw, turned away, and walked out the door, got in my car, and drove. I did not look in the rear view mirror until I was miles away. But I knew the marsh was back there, patient, watching. It would not miss me. It would not chase me.

It did not need to. Somewhere, sooner or later, in that slow black water, someone else would step too close to the edge. Someone would slip. Someone would think they were safe. Because no one ever warned them. No one ever told them about the creature that keeps score in the dark water. The warden would keep its count.

1qbb3ii,https://i.redd.it/kj5lb8x570dg1.jpeg,Nespresso VirtuoLine Resuscitated,"I have a VirtuoLine that was still going strong after being purchased sometime around 2015 AD. I think she counts as an endangered species.

Yesterday I attempted to brew a cup not realizing that the machine was unplugged. After plugging it in I must’ve pressed the button the right combination of times to trigger an error code and ruin my morning. I got the double blink error white light and made a French press coffee while I messed with troubleshooting. This went on for two days and I was already begrudgingly researching replacements for Big Red. 

After wiping the IR reader, deep cleaning the spinning piece on top, blowing air through the water thing to clear a possible air bubble this was the only thing that worked.

1. Unlock and open the top of the machine and eject the capsule, if necessary

2. Unplug the machine.

3. Close and lock the top of the machine and plug in.

5. Tap the button to turn the machine on.

6. As soon as the light comes on, press and hold while making sure you can see the light.

7. Hold the button until the light becomes steady for a second or so. It will go back to the double blink but you’re waiting for solid blink first.

8. When you see that solid blink lift your finger and immediately start a timer for the 35 seconds. 

9.The light will keep the double blink pattern and may shut off BUT KEEP COUNTING TO 35 ANYWAY.

9. When the 35 seconds is up, immediately press the button 5 times as quickly as possible.

10. The light should then turn on and blink slowly. After 15 seconds of slow blink, the light should go steady if error is cleared properly.

Try again if it doesn’t work best precision is key with this reset. The solid steady light is easy to miss and the timing on that 35 seconds is exact. Hopefully this helps anyone else still holding on to their dinosaur Nespresso.",3,1768260808.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I just wanted to let you all know that I made my first offering for him, a cup of coffee with no sugar, some semi dark chocolate and a mini pumpkin pie (made two big ones and I prepared an extra one for him) with a glass of water. The cup went down HALF the way, like really really far down and while my friend and I were talking about him It went even lower (e joked he was listening in on the gossip about my friend's love life), the pie seems like it has teeth marks, as if someone bit into it and the chocolate is losing color. Safe to assure he's helping me as my work skyrocketed to what it was before, I'm receiving like 25% more calls than I did before. And an extra greeting I think I received from him, I'm pretty new to card reading, but when I asked him if he wanted to send me a sign about him helping me better my economy (after talking with my friend about how i hate how they represent hades as the devil and all the bad things) I pulled out the upside down devil card, I also got in my reading that I shouldn't trust the fake offers on another job and to start charging for the jobs I didn't, so yeah, seems like his signs weren't misguided.

  
I wanna add a question: How and when do I clean up the offerings? What do I do with that? I don't really have to hide anything as my mom is 100% in on Lord Hades giving me a hand, but I wanna be sure I'm doing things the correct way",1,1768260655.0,Hades,0,1.0,False

My Mach-E's 12v battery died on a road trip in a city 2.5 hours away last Saturday afternoon (1/3). Ford messed up and sent the wrong tow truck first, so I had to wait outside in the rain for almost 2 hours before the right one came in. 

Finally they towed it in, said the hood latch and motor is also defective, so it will need to be held until Monday (1/5) since the shop closes on Sundays. Because of this, wife and I had to take the Amtrak train back home as our car was dead. $1500 is the new total. 

We don't get a call until 2:45pm on Monday that they need to order the hood parts and it'll get there tomorrow (1/6) morning. Then, they'll be able to fix the hood and swap the battery out, and it'll be good for pickup Tuesday afternoon. I say awesome, but because I need to take the train, I need to take the Amtrak 2.5 hours back and can be there Wednesday (1/7) morning to pick up. Dude says okay, sounds great. 

Wednesday comes around, I'm on the train MID-RIDE, and I call around the time the dealership is open. He says, ""oh hey! The car's not ready yet actually. The parts haven't arrived.""  I say ""??? you said it would be ready Tuesday, I'm on the train now an hour away. What do you mean?"" --- parts still have not arrived but he can give me a rental car. Asks me to hang around town Wednesday night to pick up tomorrow because parts say it'll get here Thursday (1/8). I figure something out but need to buy clothes and toiletries because I just brought myself on the train. 

Thursday rolls around. It's 2pm I'm at a random coffee shop. Get a text (screenshot) that it's NOT READY. Parts STILL have not arrived. 

I angrily drive home 2.5 away in the rental car, pissed. Friday (1/9) get a call that it's ready, and he sends me the text making sure to give him 5 stars. 

I spent hundreds of dollars and hours of dollars due to empty promises and fake dates. The only thing I get reimbursed is $30 gas and $13 Lyft ride from train to dealership.

1qbaw31,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Select-Safety-7125/comments/1qbaw31/this_marsh_is_hungry/,This Marsh Is Hungry,"People who grow up near marshland learn rules nobody explains. You do not go out after dark. You do not follow lights you cannot place. And when someone says part of the swamp is off limits, you do not ask why. In Hollow Marsh, people do not vanish with a lot of fanfare. They simply stop being part of daily life. The locals say something watches that place.

They call it the warden. The first thing I noticed about Hollow Marsh was the smell. It did not smell like normal swamp, not just mud and muck and rotten leaves. There was something thick in it, like pond water that had been trapped in a bucket for years.

It clung to the back of my throat as I stood at the edge of the wooden overlook, hands on the damp rail, staring out over the reeds. “Smell never really goes away,” a voice said behind me. “You get used to it. Or you move.” I turned and saw him, the same wiry old man who had been standing behind the counter at the gas station when I pulled into town that afternoon.

Same faded ball cap, same flannel shirt, same permanent frown carved into his cheeks. “You follow me out here?” I asked. He shrugged. “You asked where Hollow Marsh was. Figured you would end up here before dark. Outsiders always do.” “I am not a tourist,” I said. “I grew up here. Left when I was a kid.” He squinted at me, eyes narrowing. “What is your name then?” “Evan Pike.” His expression shifted.

Not friendly, but different. Recognition mixed with something like pity. “Jim Holloway,” he said. “I knew your father. He was a good man.” I did not know what to say to that, so I just turned back to the marsh. The water spread out in a wide shallow basin, choked with cattails and tall brown reeds. Trees leaned in around the edges as if they were all trying not to fall in.

The sun was sinking behind them, painting the water with broken strips of gold that did not reach very far. Near the middle of the marsh there was a dark patch, a round area where the vegetation thinned out and the water looked deeper. Even from the overlook, I could see that it was black. Not dark green, not brown. Black. “You should not be here this late,” Jim said quietly. “It is barely six,” I replied.

He did not answer that. Instead he stepped up beside me and rested his elbows on the rail. For a long time we both watched the marsh in silence. I had not come back for scenery. My father was dead, lungs finally giving up after decades in the mill, and I had inherited the ugly little house on the edge of town that no one wanted to buy.

I lost my job a month later, and the cheap answer was obvious. Move back. Live there. Start over in the place I had tried to forget. I told myself it was temporary. I told myself a lot of things. “What do you remember about this place?” Jim asked. I frowned. “Nothing. We moved away when I was eight.” “You remember your father coming out here with the search parties?  When the Miller boy went missing?”

Something stirred, deep in the part of my mind that remembered cold mornings and the smell of wet moss. My father, lacing up boots. My mother, saying it was not a good idea to involve himself. Arguments in the kitchen. My father saying something about doing his part. “I remember people talking,” I said slowly. “A kid fell in.” Jim eyed the marsh. “That is what they said.” “You don’t think so?” He snorted. “Kids fall in ponds.  Kids fall in rivers. They do not vanish in waist deep water while a dozen grown men are ten yards away with flashlights.”

I did not like the way he said vanish. “What happened then?” I asked. Jim scratched at his cheek. “The same thing that has always happened. The marsh took what it was due, and everything went back to normal for a while.” He said it like it was a simple fact. “What it was due?” I echoed. He sighed. “Your father never told you the story, did he?” “I guess not,” I said. Jim nodded, as if that confirmed something for him. He tapped the rail once with his knuckles. “Then let me tell you the one he should have told you,” he said. “It is the only rule that matters in this town.”

“The marsh does not fall behind.” The wind rattled the reeds like dry bones. A crow called from somewhere in the trees. The dark patch in the center of the marsh seemed to shift, as if something turned just under that flat black surface. I swallowed. “What does that even mean?” He glanced at the sky. The last strips of orange were fading to gray. “Not here,” he said. “Come by the station tomorrow morning, Six sharp. Bring coffee. Black. I will show you something. I shouldn’t have to say it but don’t stay here to much longer.”

Before I could argue, he pushed away from the railing and walked back down the path toward the gravel lot. I watched his outline shrink between the trees until he blended with the dark. The marsh waited in front of me, patient and still.

Then, from somewhere near that black patch, I saw a ripple. Not a small wave. Not wind. A wide, slow circle spreading outward, as if something very large had moved just below the surface. I told myself it was a fish. A log. A trick of light. Then I left. The next morning I poured two coffees into paper cups from the old machine in my kitchen, drove into town, and found Jim already waiting in front of the gas station.

He was leaning against the ice machine, arms folded, as if he had been there for hours. “You are late,” he said, taking the cup without thanks. “It is six o five,” I replied. “In this town that counts as late.” He jerked his head toward the side of the station and started around it. I followed, feeling like a kid again, dragged along by some adult who had decided to share a story I was not sure I wanted.

Behind the station was a cinderblock garage, a row of rusty oil drums, and, tucked back against the fence, a small office trailer. Jim unlocked the door and led me inside. The trailer smelled like dust and old paper. Metal shelves lined the walls, stacked with cardboard boxes and binders. There was a desk with a cracked plastic top, a single chair, and a crooked corkboard covered in yellowed newspaper clippings.

Jim nodded at the wall. “There.” I stepped closer. The clippings were all about Hollow Marsh. LOCAL TEEN MISSING NEAR HOLLOW MARSH. SEARCH CONTINUES FOR MISSING HUNTER, WOMAN VANISHES AFTER NIGHT NEAR MARSH The dates ran in a rough pattern. Nineteen Seventy one. Seventy four. Seventy eight. Eighty two. The gaps were not exact, but they were close.

Three or four years apart, over and over. I scanned downward, tracking the years. There were a few mentions of drownings in other places, a car wreck on the highway, a house fire. Jim had circled the words about the marsh in red ink. “That is only the ones they admit to,” he said. “The drunk who wandered in and never walked out.  The kid who liked to sneak out at night. The woman whose husband swore she left town. If the last place they were seen was within spitting distance of Hollow Marsh, I count it.” 

I swallowed. “So what is the pattern then?” Jim stepped up beside me and pointed a nicotine stained finger at the rows of dates. “Count the years between them,” he said. “Roughly three.  Sometimes two, sometimes four. But the count is steady. The marsh takes someone on a schedule. When it does, the town gets a quiet stretch. No accidents, no drownings, no odd vanishings. Then the count creeps up again.” 

“You think this is deliberate?” I asked. “I do not think,” Jim replied. “I know. The older folks had a name for the thing in the swamp.  They called it the Warden. Something that keeps tally in that water.”

I let out an unsteady laugh. “So this is, what, a town monster story to keep kids out of the mud?” “If it was just that,” he said, “you would not see this.” He tapped a clipping near the bottom of the board. It was newer, maybe fifteen years old. THIRD LOCAL MISSING IN A YEAR, ALL LAST SEEN NEAR HOLLOW MARSH.

I read the subheading. Then I noticed the date. The same year my father packed us up and moved. “I do not remember this,” I said, voice low. “You were a kid,” Jim said. “Your father did not want you anywhere near it. He was out there every night with the search parties. “What happened?” I asked. “The marsh fell behind,” Jim said simply. “Four years went by with no one taken.

People thought it was over. They started walking their dogs down there. Kids went to drink at the overlook. Then that year came, and it took three before the frost.” “Accidents,” I said weakly. Jim shook his head. “All of them were people who should have known better. A man who tried to drain part of it for a building project.  A kid who boasted about swimming across it. A woman who used to dump trash in the reeds at night. The Warden does not just keep count. It also punishes.” 

I turned away from the board. My head felt stuffed. “This is insane,” I said. “You cannot blame a swamp for every bad thing that happens near town.” “You can believe whatever you want,” Jim replied. “I am telling you the rule.  The warden does not fall far behind. If it goes too long without a proper offering, that thing in the water comes looking.” 

I did not sleep much that night. The house my father left me creaked in the wind. Every sound was like a footstep outside the door or a slap of something against the windows. I knew it was my own mind, stirred up by stories and clippings, but logic grows stale in the dark.

I got out of bed around midnight and walked to the kitchen for water. As I stood in the narrow hallway, I heard it. A faint sound, far off but clear in the stillness. Slosh. Slosh. Slosh. As if someone were walking while completely soaked, heavy boots full of water, every step leaving a puddle. I froze. The sound drifted, not quite outside the house, not quite inside.

It seemed to move along the street, past the front of the house, then fade toward town. You are imagining it, I told myself. In the morning, when I stepped onto the porch, there were no wet footprints. The dusty road looked the same. But something small had been left on the top step. A clutch of marsh reeds, tied together with a strip of filthy cloth.

I stared at it for a long time. By mid morning, the whole town knew. “Jim says it is a sign,” the cashier told me at the grocery store. “Means the count is coming due.” At the post office, an old woman shook her head. “Should have seen this coming. No one has gone missing in years.” At the diner, the waitress poured my coffee and whispered, “If you hear knocking after midnight, do not answer the door.” “I thought this was about the marsh,” I said.  She shivered. “You think that thing cares where you are standing when it takes you?” 

That afternoon I drove back out to Hollow Marsh because I had no better ideas and because fear does not always tell you to stay away. Sometimes it drags you closer. The overlook was empty. The air above the water shimmered with heat, but the marsh itself looked cold.

Flies buzzed in slow circles. The dark patch near the center had grown, or I had convinced myself it had. I leaned on the rail and tried to breathe. “All right,” I said under my breath. “If you are real, show me something.” Nothing happened, of course. Then I had the thought that ruined everything. What if you could cheat it?

If the Warden needed a body to keep its count straight, maybe it did not care where that body came from. If something already dead ended up in that water, would it be enough to satisfy whatever rule the marsh obeyed? On the ride back into town, I passed the small veterinary clinic on the edge of the highway. Out back there was a bright blue dumpster.

The idea finished forming. This is not your problem, I told myself. You could move. But the truth sat heavy in my chest. I did not have the money to move. I did not have a job waiting anywhere. The house was paid off. The only asset I had was planted at the edge of this town, and this town was planted at the edge of that marsh.

If the Warden was real, I was stuck with it. For the rest of the day, I tried not to think about the dumpster behind the clinic. By nightfall I had lost that fight. Clouds swallowed the moon. The road to Hollow Marsh was a strip of darker gray between the trees. I drove with my lights off for the last quarter mile, wincing at every crackle of gravel under the tires.

The bundle on the passenger seat smelled like freezer burn and something metallic. The clinic dumpster had not been locked. The thick black bags had been heavier than I expected. I told myself they were only animal remains, things already gone, things no one wanted. I parked behind a screen of scrub trees, far from the small gravel lot near the overlook path.

No one drove out here after dark if they could help it. My heart still hammered like I was about to rob a bank. I hauled the bag out of the car, staggered under the weight, and half dragged it down the path. Every twig that snapped seemed to reverberate through the area. Frogs stopped croaking as I passed, as if the whole marsh were holding its breath.

At the edge of the walkway, I stopped. The marsh stretched out in front of me, a black sheet broken by darker shapes. The smell was stronger at night, sour and heavy. “This is stupid,” I whispered. I wrestled the bag over the rail, tore it open with a box cutter, and spilled its contents into the water. “There,” I said through my teeth. “That should count for something.” The marsh swallowed it without comment.

For a long moment I stood there, waiting for some sign. Lightning. A roar. A voice from the reeds. Anything. Nothing came. Then, from directly below the overlook, I heard a sound. Not a splash. Not a frog. A slow, thick gurgle. Like someone trying to breathe through a throat full of mud. Something pale moved just under the surface, brushing against the submerged posts of the walkway.

Skin, I thought wildly. That is skin. I stumbled back, almost fell, then turned and ran up the path, branches slapping my arms. I could hear the sound behind me, following the posts, scraping along the wood. At the car, I fumbled the keys and dropped them, cursed, picked them up with shaking hands, and finally got the engine started.

Gravel spat from under the tires as I tore away from the marsh and did not slow down until the first streetlights of town appeared ahead. By the time I collapsed into bed, dawn was bleeding into the sky. When I woke, it was to the sound of my phone buzzing on the nightstand. I answered without checking the display. “Evan,” Jim said on the other end.  His voice sounded strained and brittle. “Turn on your television.” “It doesn’t work,” I said. “Then go stand outside,” he replied. “You will hear enough.” 

He hung up. My mouth was dry. I rolled out of bed, pulled on yesterday’s jeans, and walked to the front door. When I opened it, the first thing I heard was the wail of a siren.  It came from somewhere near the highway, long and rising, then cut off, then started again. Other sounds carried with it. Shouting. A woman crying. The chop of a helicopter far off. I stepped off the porch. Neighbors were gathered in the road, some in bathrobes, some in work clothes, all looking in the same direction. Toward the edge of town and the tree line that hid the marsh. “Car went in,” someone said. “Up by the clinic.” “Took the ditch too fast,” another voice added. “Hit the embankment and went straight into the drainage pond.” My heart dropped straight through my ribs. Drainage pond. Clinic. “Did they get them out?” I asked. A man I recognized from the diner shook his head. “Driver was pinned.  Water filled the cab before anybody could reach him.” 

“Who was it?” I whispered. He hesitated. “Doctor Reeves. The vet."" The man whose name was painted on the side of the clinic in tidy letters. The man whose practice I had raided for the pieces I had dumped into the marsh. He had been working late, I thought. Maybe locking up.

Maybe taking the curve faster than usual because he wanted to get home. Maybe his tires slipped on something. Or maybe the thing that keeps count had decided that if I wanted to involve his clinic in the ledger, it would balance it in its own way. My stomach twisted. I felt something watching us. Not from the crowd, not from the road, but from farther off.

The tree line swayed, leaves trembling. The air smelled faintly of stagnant water. The marsh does not fall behind. The words rang in my head, in Jim’s voice. I turned and got into my car. I found Jim at the overlook. He stood at the rail, staring at the dark patch in the center of the marsh. The sky above was cloudy and low, crushing the light out of everything. “You did something stupid,” he said without looking at me.

I opened my mouth to deny it, then closed it again. There did not seem to be much point. “I thought it would work,” I said. My voice sounded small in the open air. “If it just needed bodies, then maybe there was a way to feed it without anyone else getting hurt.” Jim laughed once. It was an ugly sound. “You tried to bargain with something that does not know what a bargain is,” he said. “That thing in there only understands two numbers.  Ahead and behind.” 

“They were already dead in that bag.” “The Warden does not care,” Jim replied. “You pointed at that clinic and told the marsh that is where you wanted the count to come from. It took you at your word.” He finally turned to face me.

His eyes were bloodshot. “Do you understand now?” he asked. “There is no cheating. There is no offering some poor animal and calling it even. There is only the count. If you try to dodge it, bend it, move it over an inch, it snaps back and takes more.” My throat was tight. “So what happens now?” “The same thing that always happens,” Jim said. “People mourn.  They put flowers by the ditch. They say it was bad luck, a slick patch, a moment of distraction. They forget the reeds that will start growing thicker there next year.” 

“And the warden?” I forced myself to ask. His gaze shifted past me, out over the water. “For a while, it is ahead,” he said. “When the frost comes, it will be even.

Then the years start again.” I stared at the black patch. It seemed larger now. I could see something moving under the surface, just at the edge of my vision. Not a fish. Not a log. Something bigger. Something that brushed the reeds aside as it passed. The wind shifted, carrying the smell around us. In it, under the rot and mud, I thought I could smell something else.

Antiseptic. Rubber gloves. The faint memory of a clinic hallway. “I did not mean for that to happen,” I said. He sighed. “Intention does not count for much with things like this.” For a long time we stood there without speaking. Finally Jim said, “You have a choice to make, Evan. Same one your father faced.” “Leave?” I asked.

He nodded. “Some folks stay. They make peace with it. They pretend it is all coincidence. They live with the knowledge that every few years the water will take someone, and they just hope it is not them or theirs. Others decide they do not want that thing in their rear view mirror every day.” “And my father?” I asked. “He stayed as long as he thought he was helping,” Jim replied. “After that year with the three of them, he knew he could not do anything.

So he packed you up and left. Tried to keep the story from following you.” I thought of the house, the unpaid bills, the empty job listings in town. I thought of the clinic, the twisted wreck of the car in the ditch, the reeds that would grow around that spot. “I have nowhere else to go,” I said. “That is the lie this place loves the most,” Jim said softly.

We both watched as a slow ripple spread outward from the center of the marsh. It rolled under the mat of reeds and lapped against the posts of the overlook. For a moment, as the water rose against the wood, I saw something pressed to the surface. A face. Bloated, pale, eyes open and staring. Mouth full of black water. It might have been my imagination, stitched together from fear and guilt.

Then it sank, leaving only the usual dark. “You see it now,” Jim whispered. “Yeah,” I said. At home, I walked through the rooms without really seeing them. The old photos. The sagging couch. The boxes I had not unpacked. My father had tried to cut me free of this place. I had moved right back into its shadow. In the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face.

When I looked up, the mirror showed my reflection, pale and tired. For a second, as the water dripped from my chin, I thought I saw something standing behind me in the doorway. Tall. Thin. Shape made of dripping reeds and black, rippling skin, as if someone had stuffed a body with murky water and let it walk around without bones.

Its face wasn’t quite a face, features suggested by light and shadow. Where eyes should have been, dark sockets stared back at me. I blinked. The doorway was empty. My heart slammed against my ribs hard enough to hurt. It was not in the house, I told myself. It was in my head. In the marsh.

I sat down on the edge of the tub and buried my face in my hands. After a while, I stood, walked to the bedroom, and dragged my suitcase from under the bed. I did not have a plan. I did not have a job waiting anywhere else. I had half a tank of gas and a mind full of fear. But I knew one thing. Staying felt less like survival and more like standing at the lip of a dark hole, waiting for my turn.

As I carried the suitcase through the front room, I paused at the window. From there I could see, far off beyond the stand of trees, a faint shimmer where the marsh lay. For a moment, I thought I saw something tall standing in the water, right at the edge of the dark patch. Watching the town. Waiting. The distance made it impossible to be sure.

It might have been a dead tree. A trick of light. Or it might have been the Warden, counting. I set my jaw, turned away, and walked out the door, got in my car, and drove. I did not look in the rear view mirror until I was miles away. But I knew the marsh was back there, patient, watching. It would not miss me. It would not chase me.

It did not need to. Somewhere, sooner or later, in that slow black water, someone else would step too close to the edge. Someone would slip. Someone would think they were safe. Because no one ever warned them. No one ever told them about the creature that keeps score in the dark water. The warden would keep its count.

Yesterday my parents hosted a tea for my grandpa’s birthday at my family’s house. Earlier that day my bf called and asked if I wanted to go shopping with him because he wanted to treat me. Very kind, not an occasion. He ended up spending around £250 on me. I thanked him a lot and told him how grateful I was


We go back to my house, have the tea with my family. During the day I helped him wrap his present for my grandpa, made him plates of food, made him two coffees. When everyone left, we went upstairs and i sat on his lap and we were kissing him for a while (we can’t do anything more at the moment as I’ve recently had a procedure). He had decided he would stay for an extra hour to spend more time together. I offered to cook him dinner, he said no because he didn’t want to spend our hour cooking/eating.

Earlier that day I’d said I wanted to talk through ideas for my birthday (I already had 3 bars in mind and just wanted his opinion). I asked if he was happy for me to show them to him in this time, and he agreed. We talked for ~15 mins, he got irritated and kept suggesting completely different bars to what I’d suggested, which I  had said I just want your opinion on these 3 tbh, and he then left in a huff.

Afterwards he called me and said that after how nice he’d been to me, I gave him nothing in return. Specifically said I didn’t give him a back rub / shoulder massage, and that it would’ve “made his day”. He said I put in zero effort, less than the bare minimum. I said I didn’t realise there was an expectation and that I’d already offered dinner to which he replied dinner “isn’t a treat, it’s a basic necessity”.

I said I don’t see relationships as same day transactions and I do a lot for him without expecting anything back immediately (planning his birthday, organising holidays, flat searching with him for hours even though I wasn’t moving in, emotional support, massages, cleaning his flat when I’m there. )He said it’s normal when you do something nice, you expect something back, and he can’t dispute that - yes, he expected something in return. He also said I didn’t even ask or think about what he wanted, or what I could’ve done for him, but in our additional hour alone, I chose to do soemthing centred around me again. 

He then said because I’m “not appreciating how big the gestures are”, he’s going to scale back treating me and split things more evenly going forward. Context- he earns over 3x what I do.

I’m now questioning whether I’m being unreasonable. Am I supposed to offer a massage / something physical every time he does something nice? Ask what he wants in return? I genuinely thought gifts were gifts, not exchanges/transactions. I feel like generosity has become conditional and that I’m being punished for not complying with expectations I didn’t even know existed.",31,1768260226.0,AITAH,61,1.0,False

I racked up credit card debt out of a combination of poor financial decisions, a contract job, financially supporting my now ex, and my older home being a money pit. I also never learned budgeting from my family, my father to this day lives on credit and is always “moving money around” with different cards..

I just saw Saturday that Citi cut my credit limit across 3 cards by thousands of dollars. The only other bank to do that to me has been Wells Fargo.

I have been doing the snowball method for 2 years and worked additional jobs to pay $65,000 in credit card debt down to $40,000. My credit limits were staying the same, but I got 0% balance transfer offers to help me not pay so much in 2024. In 2025 I up’d my income so that I was taking home $53,000 with ONE job rather than $35,000 with the multiple jobs.

I really felt like I was making progress towards at least lowering my credit utilization across all cards. I did pay off my lowest balance cards a few times, but they went in use with mainly house repairs (AC, roof and fencing repair). I’m at $53,400 total retail debt right now.

I was trying to get my utilization down to try to do a HELOC to roll the credit card debt into there as I plan to not move, but I can’t do that now. I don’t want to take a consolidation loan or try to take out anymore credit card applications. My FICO was 720 until my limits got cut. Now I’m sure that’s gonna be a huge drop when it reports this month. Sometimes I feel like I’ll never know what it feels like to be debt free.

Should I switch to the avalanche method? And is there anything else I can do to help move me forward?

To answer other questions: I don’t have subscriptions and I’m keeping Door Dash reined in. I also am finally committing to making coffee at home.

1qbas8v,https://v.redd.it/jh3iahlz30dg1,Original Song - Eating Off the Vine,"Hey all, first time posting. This is an original song about growing up and coming to more deeply love and appreciate your family. It's specifically about a particular spring day, when my extended family went out to my grandparents' house to chop and stack wood for their furnace and get their garden ready; it was something we did every year, but this year was the first after my grandfather had passed away. It had been a time that I had had a lot of tension with my mom - arguments about this and that, a feeling that we weren't close like we'd been before. But I started to see her, and our whole family, differently after Papa died: as strong but vulnerable, as not just giving but needing love and attention and acceptance.

Would love to hear thoughts and feedback!

Lyrics:

Walk with me up onto the mountain, where we bury all the family dogs  
Spider-dew webs across the pathway, gathering like silk around my arms  
Tell me what you know and all you believe in before we slip back into our lives  
This is such a delicate season, little streams of snow-melt running by  
The brush is thick and leaves our shine bleeding. Wipe them off before we go inside

We're on the rise, even all this time, cleaving along the line, eating off the vine

You swore you would not be like our mother, living in the clutter of her home  
Spending all her time just doing upkeep, rearranging photos on the wall  
You would keep only what was needed, and always stay light enough to move  
We reckon the last frost is now departed, everyone is in a gentle mood  
Gather round to help replant her garden, bulbs of hyacinth and marigold

We're on the rise, even all this time, cleaving along the line, eating off the vine

Let her pray over you  
Let her say what she wants to  
Let her hold your hands again  
Let her try to be your friend

Easy now don't pack the roots too tightly, or they'll be drowned before there's even rain  
Kneeling in the cool grass beside me, we can smell the coffee being made  
Tell me what you know about forgiveness, raw and clean as parsnips under ice  
Listen to them talking in the kitchen, can you hear the kindness in her voice?  
Do you think that she's immune to beauty? Do you think she never made a choice?

We're on the rise, even all this time, cleaving along the line, eating off the vine

The documents at issue including Betty B’s operating agreement, board updates, expert reports, K-1 tax forms, and deposition excerpts are either stale, based on public information, or directly relied upon by Lively and her experts.

The key turned in the lock, like a thousand times before. The door creaked open, a sound that only he noticed.

He realized the lights were off.

This was odd, but not unusual. Sometimes, Anna liked to leave the house dim when it was bright outside. But tonight, there was only darkness.

He stepped inside, holding his breath.

Anna's furniture polish and vanilla perfume filled the hallway. He hung his jacket on the coat rack after a long day. He waited for his daughter's joyful shrieks, but only silence filled the room.

As he entered the living room, he saw a shadow. She was sitting in a position that made her almost invisible against the dark sofa.

The first thing he recognized was her eyes. These eyes searched more than they should have and blinked very little.

""Good evening.""

Seraphina was the one.

""What are you doing here?""

""I came to speak with you.""

Seraphina stood up and walked gracefully across the room.

""I've learned many things.""

She went on to describe the wiretaps, private conversations, exchanges, and sources. When Seraphina realized everything, it was like a nightmare come true.

""Every encounter leaves a mark, and every leak has a path."" Though not as subtle as you believe, you have been methodical.

A trickle of sweat ran down his neck. He was as terrified as an animal caught in a trap.

""I don't know what you mean.""

Seraphina grinned, but it was an unfriendly grin. It was more akin to a sneer.

""You are employed by the government. A rebel spy who posed as a legitimate recruiter. A masterpiece of dishonesty, but you made a mistake.""

He thought of Anna and recalled how her hair gleamed in the early morning. He remembered their kids' carefree times and the sound of her happy laughter.

""What error?""

""You thought I was naive.""

Her accusation hit him hard. On instinct, he grabbed his weapon. Years of training took over as he gripped it with determination. He needed to silence her and escape. There was always a way out - he had to think.

“... Stop.”

Her soothing voice was like a knife in the air. Her certainty, the kind that knew what came next, made him freeze. He couldn't help but freeze.

""Look at what's on the table.""

She gestured to a small black bag on the coffee table. He opened it after pausing.

An unpleasant odor filled the room.

There were three still-bloody eyes inside.

At first, he thought it was a trick or a hallucination, anything to deny reality. The first eye matched Anna's hazel eyes, and the other two matched the eyes of their children.

“By the gods...”

""Follow my instructions without question if you want to protect the rest of your family. Do you understand?""

He gave one, two, and three nods.

Seraphina put her hand on his shoulder. It was light, almost tender, in this moment. She leaned in close, her breath cold.

""What I say will be reported by you. If you fail me even once, you will hear their cries for days, begging for forgiveness.""

Like sand trickling through an hourglass, the days went by slowly.

He complied with her requests for reports and meetings. He even created fictitious documents to back up the details he provided her. He also gave her false information. The information she sought was given to the government and rebels, but it contained both accurate and inaccurate information. He felt increasingly ensnared under her authority with every report. He seemed to be bound to her will by an additional thread.

Every morning, he questioned whether she would honor her promise. Every night before he went to sleep, he experienced the same fear.

Days slipped away into dark corners and alleys. Places seemed unreal, as if they came from dreams.

One alley was like all the others. It had worn cobblestones, peeling walls, and signs of rust and decay.

A hooded figure stepped out of the shadows. He didn't recognize the face. A cold blade pierced his body with a sudden, intense pain. As his vision began to blur, he heard a voice he didn't know.

""You have the Liberator's thanks, trash.""

It took him a moment to comprehend.

Seraphina had treated him like a worthless tool.

The chilly stones caught him. The sky overhead brought back memories of his mother pointing out constellations.

Nothing changed in the sky.

The stars would endure forever.

The absence of him would not affect the world. He whispered Anna's name one last time as he exhaled his final breath, a tear streaming down his cheek.

It was a favor. A gap in the schedule. A “can you just cover two nights until we get someone up there?” kind of thing.

I said yes because I’ve been saying yes to the park in some form for most of my adult life, and because the tower makes sense to me. The routine. The lists. The way your world shrinks down to weather, visibility, and a radio that either works or it doesn’t.

The lookout was technically “decommissioned,” which sounds dramatic until you realize it just means the budget moved on. The stairs were still solid, the catwalk still intact, the windows still swept clean enough to see smoke. The radio still had power if you fed the generator and kept the battery topped off.

It was the kind of place you could pretend was abandoned while still being maintained, because nobody wanted to be the person who admitted they’d let it rot.

I got up there around late afternoon with a pack, a thermos, and a clipboard. The sun was low enough that it turned the treetops copper. From the cab you could see the whole back side of the park: ridgelines folding into each other, cut by long shadows and a few pale scars where lightning fires had burned years ago.

The tower creaked in the wind the way all towers do. Not dangerous creaking. Just the sound of wood and metal remembering they’re tall.

Inside, everything smelled like dust, pine pitch, and old coffee.

There was a laminated sheet tacked by the radios with three bullet points in bold.

DO NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE OVER UNMONITORED FREQUENCIES.

If you are lost, stay put. Use emergency phones or 911. If you hear a voice directing you off-trail, do not respond.

Somebody had underlined the last line twice, hard enough to emboss the plastic.

I remember smirking at it when I first saw it. Not because it was funny, but because it was such a weird thing to have to write down. It felt like superstition in a workplace that runs on checklists.

I did my first call-in with dispatch. Gave them my location, weather read, and the fact I had a clear view of the southern ridge. They logged it, told me to call again at 2100, and that was that.

The first few hours were quiet.

I made coffee on a little camp stove. I filled out a logbook nobody reads unless something goes wrong. I watched the light fade. The forest below turned into one solid dark mass with only the service road cutting a faint line through it.

The tower radio for the lookout was an old handheld unit plugged into a charging cradle by the window. Someone had wrapped the antenna base with a band of black electrical tape, and the casing had a crescent-shaped gouge on the bottom left corner, like it had been dropped on rock years ago and never repaired. The faceplate sticker was so sun-faded you could barely read it, but if you tilted it just right, you could make out the handwritten block letters: LOOKOUT 3.

Around 2030, the radio squelched and popped in a way that made my shoulders lift automatically. You don’t ignore that sound, not out there.

“Lookout Three, dispatch,” came the voice. “You copy?”

I pressed the transmit. “Copy. Go ahead.”

There was a pause, then dispatch again. “We got some weird traffic earlier. Not on our main. Just letting you know in case you hear it.”

I glanced at the laminated sheet by the radio.

“Define weird,” I said.

Dispatch sounded tired. Same operator I’d talked to a hundred times, the kind who can sound calm even when there’s a crash on the highway and someone’s screaming in the background.

“Unmonitored channel. Someone calling for ranger assistance. Using the word ‘lookout.’”

My stomach tightened a little. “Someone knows there’s a tower up here.”

“Yeah,” dispatch said. “Probably kids. Or someone with an old radio. You’re not to answer anything that isn’t us. If you hear it, log it. That’s all.”

I looked at the underlined line on the laminated sheet and felt my earlier smirk dry up.

“Copy,” I said. “I won’t engage.”

I meant it.

At 2100, I called dispatch with my update. Wind had picked up. Temperature dropping. Visibility still good.

“Copy,” dispatch said. “If you hear anything unusual, do not respond. Do not leave the tower. Rangers are already stretched thin.”

“Copy,” I repeated.

I remember looking at the stairs after that. The trapdoor that led down. The way the tower’s shadow cut across the catwalk in the moonlight. I remember thinking, for no logical reason, that it would be easy to step out and go down and check the perimeter, just to prove to myself nothing was out there.

I didn’t do it.

I locked the trapdoor like I always do in old structures, because it keeps the wind from rattling it. I set my flashlight beside the logbook. I sat in the chair by the window and listened to the tower creak.

At 2217, the radio squelched again, but this time it wasn’t dispatch.

Not a call sign. Not a proper prefix.

Just a soft click, then a voice, thin through static.

“Ranger…?”

I froze with my coffee halfway to my mouth.

I didn’t touch the transmit button.

The voice came again, a little clearer. “Ranger, I need help.”

It sounded like a man trying to keep panic down. Breathing too fast. Words clipped. The kind of voice you hear right before people do something stupid.

I stared at the radio like it was going to bite me.

The laminated sheet was right there in my peripheral vision. The underlined warning felt like it was aimed directly at me.

Do not respond.

I sat still.

The voice on the unmonitored channel tried again. “I’m on Trail Six, I think. I’m lost. I can’t find the pull-off. Ranger station, do you copy?”

Trail Six was on the back side. It wasn’t the busiest trail, but it wasn’t obscure. People wandered on it all the time thinking it was “easy.”

My thumb hovered over transmit, then stopped.

I told myself I could call dispatch. That’s the right move. Log it. Let someone with authority decide if it’s real.

I picked up the handset for the main dispatch channel.

Before I could key it, the unmonitored channel voice came again, lower now.

“I can hear you up there,” it said. “Please.”

My throat went dry.

You could hear the tower. The generator hum. The wind.

But “hear you up there” made it feel like there was a line between us that wasn’t radio at all.

I keyed dispatch.

“Dispatch, Lookout Three.”

“Go ahead,” dispatch said immediately, alert now.

“I’m receiving traffic on an unmonitored frequency. Caller claims lost on Trail Six. Says he can hear me up here.”

There was a pause, then dispatch again, quieter. “Do not engage. We’ll send a unit to check Trail Six access points. Stay in the tower. Confirm you’re secure.”

“I’m secure,” I said. “Trapdoor locked.”

“Copy,” dispatch said. “Do not leave. Do not respond.”

I set the handset down.

On the unmonitored channel, the man’s voice changed.

It went flat for a second, like the emotion dropped out.

Then it said, in my own voice, “Lookout Three, dispatch.”

I felt my stomach drop in a way I haven’t felt since I was a kid and a car spun out on ice right in front of me.

It wasn’t a perfect recording quality. It was radio-thin. But it was my cadence. My breath. The tiny throat-clear I do without thinking before I speak.

The radio clicked again, and my own voice repeated, “Go ahead.”

I didn’t move.

I didn’t even breathe right.

The unmonitored channel kept going like it was practicing.

“My location, weather read…”

It was pulling phrases out of context, stitching them together like a puppet.

I grabbed the lookout radio and turned the volume down until the speaker was barely audible. Not off. I couldn’t bring myself to turn it off. Off felt like it would be worse, like closing your eyes when you’re sure something is still there.

I wrote in the logbook with a shaking hand.

2217: Unmonitored traffic. Male voice. Trail Six. Mimicked my call sign and dispatch phrasing.

I underlined mimicked twice, hard enough the pen tore the paper.

The tower creaked.

Outside, the wind rose and fell.

Then I heard something that wasn’t radio at all.

A knock.

Not on the trapdoor.

On the base of the tower, far below.

One heavy knock, metal on wood.

I stood so fast the chair scraped.

I leaned toward the floor hatch, listening.

Another knock.

Then, faintly, a voice from below, carried up through the stairwell like someone standing at the bottom and shouting carefully.

“Ranger!”

My skin tightened.

No one should have been down there. The access road is gated at night. There are signs. There are cameras, even if they’re old.

I moved to the window and looked down.

The base of the tower was a black shape among darker trees. The moonlight didn’t reach the ground well.

I saw nothing.

Then the voice came again, from directly below the tower, and it sounded like dispatch.

“Lookout Three, come down. We need you.”

My mouth went numb.

Dispatch would never tell me to leave the tower at night for a lost camper without sending a unit. Dispatch would never use that tone, like it was urgent and casual at the same time.

I reached for the main dispatch handset.

“Dispatch, Lookout Three,” I said, forcing my voice steady. “Confirm you did not send anyone to tower base.”

Dispatch answered instantly, and there was something in the operator’s voice I hadn’t heard before.

A tightness.

“Negative,” dispatch said. “No units at your location. Stay in the tower. Do not open the hatch.”

As she spoke, the voice from below overlapped her.

“Open the hatch.”

Same words. Same rhythm.

Not through the radio speaker.

Through the stairs.

It was like the tower itself was relaying it.

I backed away from the trapdoor until my shoulders hit the opposite wall.

Dispatch kept talking, faster now. “Listen to me. Do not respond to any voice that is not on this channel. Do not open the tower. Units are en route to the access road. Do you understand?”

“I understand,” I said, but my voice came out thin.

Below, the knocking started again. Slow. Patient.

Knock.

Pause.

Knock.

Like it knew I was counting.

The unmonitored radio channel hissed in the background, even with the volume low, and through it I heard my own voice whispering, “Please.”

I don’t know what did it.

I’ve replayed the next part a hundred times and I still can’t point to a single moment where my brain broke. It wasn’t a sudden decision. It was like a series of tiny rationalizations stacking up until I couldn’t see the drop-off anymore.

Maybe someone really was down there. Maybe a hiker found the tower and was terrified. Maybe dispatch was wrong and a unit had already made it to the base. Maybe, if I just cracked the hatch and called down, I could clear it up.

Maybe the laminated sheet was for something else.

Maybe I was being dramatic.

I hate myself for the thought even now, but there was another thing too.

The voice from below sounded like my brother.

My younger brother has been dead for three years. Car accident. Wrong place, wrong time, drunk driver.

I hadn’t heard his voice in a long time, not cleanly, not without memory blurring it.

From below the tower, through the stairwell, came his voice, small like he was trying not to scare me.

“Hey,” it said. “It’s cold.”

I felt my eyes sting.

I stepped toward the hatch like a sleepwalker.

Dispatch was still in my ear, but it sounded far away now, like a TV in another room.

I unlocked the trapdoor.

The second the lock turned, the knocking stopped.

The silence that followed wasn’t dramatic. It was just empty.

I pulled the hatch up an inch and peered down into the stairwell.

Blackness. A faint smell of damp wood and old rust.

I didn’t see anyone.

I didn’t hear breathing.

Then, from halfway down the stairs, the radio crackle sound happened again, but it wasn’t coming from the lookout radio.

It was coming from the stairwell itself, like static in the air.

And my brother’s voice said softly, “Come on.”

I opened the hatch fully.

The cold air that came up was wrong. It wasn’t just night air. It smelled sour, like wet fur and something metallic.

I backed up, hand on my flashlight.

Dispatch’s voice sharpened. “Lookout Three, what are you doing? Confirm you are in the tower and the hatch is secured.”

I lied.

“In the tower,” I said. “Hatch secured.”

The words tasted like pennies.

I don’t know why I lied. Maybe because part of me already knew I was about to do something I couldn’t explain.

I grabbed my flashlight and stepped down into the stairwell.

The tower groaned as my weight shifted onto the stairs.

Each step down felt like stepping into thicker air. The darkness pressed in tight around the flashlight beam, making it feel small and weak. The metal railing was cold under my hand.

Halfway down, the beam caught something on a step.

A strip of reflective tape.

Park trail marker tape.

It was stuck to the metal like someone had pressed it there.

I stopped. My heart hammered.

That tape shouldn’t have been inside the tower. Nobody comes up here and starts peeling markers off trees to decorate.

The voice from below didn’t rush me.

It just said, patient, “Almost there.”

I kept going.

At the bottom, the tower’s base platform was open to the air. From there you step onto the ground, onto packed dirt and needles. The flashlight beam swept across the base supports, the old maintenance box, the little post where the fire extinguisher used to hang.

No person.

No ranger truck.

No fresh footprints.

I stood at the base of the tower and felt the night press in from all sides.

“Ranger?” I called, and my voice sounded too loud.

Nothing answered.

Then the lookout radio, still up in the cab, crackled faintly through the structure.

And in my own voice, it said, “Here.”

The word came from the trees to my left too, at the exact same time.

“Here.”

Like two speakers playing the same track.

My stomach dropped hard enough I almost gagged.

I backed toward the tower stairs.

The flashlight beam caught movement between two trunks.

Not a full shape. Just a shift. Something tall adjusting its weight.

I swung the light fully and saw it.

It was upright, but it wasn’t standing like a man. It looked assembled wrong. Too thin. Too long. Arms hanging low with too many joints.

The head was not antlers, not a clean skull like you see in cheap horror. It was like skin pulled tight over something sharp. Ridges under the surface. A mouth that didn’t sit right on the face, stretched farther than it should be.

The worst part was the eyes.

Not glowing. Not bright.

Dull, wet reflections in the flashlight beam, like stones at the bottom of a creek.

It didn’t charge.

It stepped forward once, quiet and confident, closing distance in a way my brain couldn’t map properly.

I turned and ran.

I hit the stairs and took them two at a time, boots clanging on metal. My hands shook so hard I nearly missed the railing.

Behind me, something moved through brush without crashing. It sounded like it knew exactly where to place its weight.

I got five steps up before a sound like a dry throat clicking came from right below the tower, closer than it should have been.

I looked down without meaning to.

It was on the first landing already, climbing without haste, long limbs folding wrong.

My flashlight beam caught its hands on the rail.

Hands like bundled sticks. Fingers too long, too many joints, gripping like clamps.

I bolted up again, lungs burning.

The tower creaked in protest, like it hated being part of this.

I hit the trapdoor platform and shoved the hatch up, scrambling through. My shoulder slammed the frame. Pain shot down my arm, but I didn’t care.

I got one knee into the cab and reached back to slam the hatch—

—and something caught me.

Not a grip. A swipe.

A fast, cold rake across my back through my shirt, like dragging a handful of bent nails from shoulder blade to ribs.

The pain didn’t even register right away. It was heat and shock and a breath that turned into a noise I didn’t recognize as mine.

I fell forward into the cab, slammed my palms on the floor, and kicked back hard. The hatch dropped. Wood thudded into place.

Then the burning hit full force.

I scrambled upright and fumbled for the lock. It didn’t align. My hands were shaking too much.

Below me, the hatch bumped once, gently, as if something had tested it.

Then again.

I shoved my weight onto it and finally got the lock to catch with a metallic click.

I pressed my back against the far wall of the cab and felt wetness spreading under my shirt. The scratches stung with every breath, each inhale pulling at torn fabric and skin like the injury wanted to remind me it was there.

Dispatch was still on my actual channel, voice edged with panic now.

“Lookout Three, respond. Respond now.”

Under my feet, another voice repeated her exact words a half-second later, using her tone so well it made my teeth ache.

I forced myself to key dispatch.

“It’s at the tower,” I said, words coming out in ragged pieces. “It mimics. It got into the stairwell. It—”

My voice hitched when my back spasmed.

Dispatch didn’t waste time asking what it was. “Stay away from the hatch. Barricade if you can. Units are two minutes out.”

The hatch bumped again, harder.

A sound like claws, or nails, dragging along the wood.

My stomach rolled. My back was on fire. I could taste copper at the back of my throat from biting down too hard.

I grabbed the heavy chair and shoved it over the hatch.

Then I grabbed the small table and jammed it against the chair.

The tower shook slightly, and for the first time I realized the thing wasn’t just testing the hatch.

It was putting weight on the tower.

Like it was climbing the supports.

The windows rattled.

The catwalk outside the cab gave a soft metallic ping as something stepped onto it.

The flashlight beam caught a shadow pass over the window.

Tall.

Too thin.

I backed away until I hit the far wall of the cab, my back screaming, and I nearly blacked out from the sudden flare of pain.

The radio shrieked with static. Not dispatch. The other channel.

And then, in my own voice, right in the speaker by my ear, it said softly, “Come down.”

The window behind me thudded once, like something tapped it with a knuckle.

Then again, harder.

I saw the outline press against the glass for a split second. Not a face, not clear, just a suggestion of that stretched mouth and ridged head.

The glass bowed.

It didn’t break, but it flexed enough to make me realize how old it was. How many winters it had seen. How many times it had been heated and cooled and stressed.

The thing outside didn’t rush. It didn’t slam wildly.

It tapped. Then waited. Then tapped again.

Like it knew time was on its side.

Dispatch was still talking, telling me to hold, to stay put, that headlights were on the access road, that they were almost there.

I believed her.

And then the voice on the other side of the glass said, in my brother’s voice again, small and cold, “I’m scared.”

That almost got me.

I won’t lie.

My hand moved toward the hatch without permission. A reflex built from a lifetime of responding to voices asking for help.

I stopped myself by biting down on the inside of my cheek until I tasted blood.

The tapping on the window stopped.

For a few seconds, the tower was still except for my breathing and the faint crackle of radios and the slow drip of something warm down my side under my shirt.

Then something scraped across the roof.

Slow.

Like fingernails being dragged along metal.

The sound traveled from one end of the roof to the other, then stopped above my head.

I looked up without meaning to.

The ceiling was thin paneling. If something heavy sat on it, the whole cab would feel it.

The tower creaked, a deep groan, like it was taking a breath.

And then the hatch behind my barricade bumped from below again.

Two directions.

It was on the roof and under the floor.

Or it wanted me to think it was.

Then headlights washed the trees below in white beams, sweeping back and forth.

A ranger truck.

Another.

Radios on the dispatch channel erupted with voices. Call signs. Orders. Real human urgency.

The scraping on the roof stopped immediately.

The tapping stopped.

The pressure under the hatch eased.

For one shaky breath, I thought it was over. That it would retreat when there were more people.

Then, over the unmonitored channel, in dispatch’s exact voice, came a calm instruction.

“Units, proceed off-road. Follow the voice.”

I heard a ranger on the main channel hesitate. “Dispatch, confirm.”

Dispatch snapped, real and sharp. “Negative. Stay on the road. Do not go off-road. Do not follow any voice.”

And then, like it was enjoying itself, the unmonitored channel repeated her denial in her voice but with a tiny twist, like a smile hidden in it.

“Proceed.”

Below, one of the trucks turned its lights toward the tree line, and for a brief second I saw the shape at the edge of the beams.

Tall.

Too thin.

Half-hidden like it didn’t want to be fully seen.

Then it stepped back into the woods and the darkness swallowed it.

The rangers stayed on the road. They didn’t chase. They didn’t play hero. They swept the area, found nothing, and told me to stay in the cab until morning.

When daylight came, they walked me down the tower with two people on either side like I was the fragile one.

Halfway down, my shirt had dried stiff against my back. Every step made the scratches flare again, like the air itself was cutting me.

At the base, one of the rangers asked, “You hit something?”

I shook my head once, because I didn’t know how to answer without sounding like a lunatic.

At the park office later, I tried to explain what happened in a way that didn’t make me sound like I’d lost my mind in the dark. I talked about radio interference. About prank calls. About an animal under the tower.

The older clerk behind the counter didn’t laugh.

She slid a binder toward me, opened to a page that looked like it had been read too many times.

Incident reports. Dates. Channels. Notes about mimicry and unmonitored frequencies.

At the bottom of the page was a line underlined twice.

If it uses your voice, it already has you.

They sent me to urgent care in town anyway, the way they do when paperwork starts to smell like liability. The nurse didn’t ask many questions. She just had me turn around, lifted my shirt carefully, and went quiet for a second.

“You got lucky,” she said.

They cleaned the scratches, bandaged them in long strips, and told me to watch for infection. The back of my shirt went into a plastic bag like evidence. I drove home with my shoulders tight, trying not to move too much because every shift tugged at the raw lines under the gauze.

I quit volunteering the next week.

Not out of fear of the woods in general. I can walk a trail in daylight and enjoy it like anyone.

I quit because I learned something I can’t unlearn.

There are rules out there that aren’t about bears or weather or dehydration. There are rules about what happens when you ask for help the wrong way, on the wrong channel, in the wrong place.

And there’s one more detail I haven’t told anyone in the park system because I don’t want to see the look on their faces.

Sometime after midnight, a couple nights later, I finally fell asleep in my own bed.

I woke up at 2:17 a.m. exactly.

Not the slow drift up from a dream. The kind where your eyes open and your body is already tight, like it heard something before your brain caught up.

My back ached under the bandages. I could feel the scabbed lines pulling every time I breathed too deep.

The apartment was quiet. No cars. No neighbors. The heater clicked once and stopped.

Then I heard it.

Not from outside.

From inside the room.

A soft burst of static, like a speaker waking up.

A click.

My throat closed. I sat up so fast the sheet tangled around my legs.

The sound came again, clearer now. Static, then a tiny, controlled squelch, like someone had keyed a mic and let go.

It wasn’t my phone. My phone was on the dresser, dark and charging.

I swung my bedside lamp on.

The light filled the room, bright and normal, and for half a second my brain tried to calm down. Tried to tell me it was nothing.

Then I saw the green glow.

A faint, sick little rectangle of light coming from the crack under my bedroom door.

My heart started banging hard enough to make my vision pulse.

I got out of bed and limped to the door, barefoot, quiet, holding my breath like it mattered.

I opened it.

The hallway was lit only by the kitchen nightlight. The glow on the floor wasn’t from that.

It was coming from my living room.

I stepped out and followed it, slow, like approaching a trap you can already see.

On my coffee table—centered like someone had placed it carefully—was the tower radio from the lookout.

I knew it instantly.

Not because of the model.

Because I could see the black electrical tape wrapped around the antenna base, and that crescent-shaped gouge on the bottom left corner of the casing—the one I’d noticed because it made the radio sit crooked in its cradle up in the cab. The faceplate sticker was still sun-faded, but in the lamplight I could make out the handwritten block letters if I leaned close enough.

LOOKOUT 3.

And taped to the side of it—pressed flat, neat as a label—was a strip of reflective trail marker tape.

I didn’t touch it.

I just stood there, staring at the radio like it was a live animal.

The speaker crackled again.

Click.

Then my own voice came out of it, patient and calm, the way I sound when I’m trying to keep somebody else from panicking.

“Lookout Three… do you copy?”

I backed up until my shoulders hit the wall, and the movement tugged at my bandages hard enough to make me hiss.

The radio clicked again, and this time it didn’t use my voice.

It used dispatch.

Sharp. Official. Convincing.

“Confirm you are secure.”

I stood there in my hallway, barefoot, shaking, staring at a radio that didn’t belong in my apartment, and I realized something that made my stomach turn cold.

It wasn’t just copying voices.

It wasn’t just playing with a frequency.

It knew where the tower was.

It knew where I lived.

And it knew exactly what words would make me answer.

I didn’t answer.

I didn’t even breathe right.

I walked backward into my bedroom and shut the door and locked it like that meant anything.

The radio kept talking out in my living room, voice changing every few seconds—mine, dispatch, my brother—cycling through the ones that worked best.

I stayed in my room until sunrise, listening to it through the wall like you listen to an intruder moving around your house.

At 6:41 a.m., it went quiet.

No static. No click.

Just silence.

When I finally opened my door, the radio was gone.

There was no mark on the table. No tape. No dust disturbed. No sign it had ever been there.

Except for one thing.

1qbaj1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1qbaj1y/i_staffed_a_fire_lookout_for_one_night_something/,I Staffed a Fire Lookout for One Night. Something Tried to Talk Me Down.,"I wasn’t supposed to be staffing the lookout that week.

It was a favor. A gap in the schedule. A “can you just cover two nights until we get someone up there?” kind of thing.

I said yes because I’ve been saying yes to the park in some form for most of my adult life, and because the tower makes sense to me. The routine. The lists. The way your world shrinks down to weather, visibility, and a radio that either works or it doesn’t.

The lookout was technically “decommissioned,” which sounds dramatic until you realize it just means the budget moved on. The stairs were still solid, the catwalk still intact, the windows still swept clean enough to see smoke. The radio still had power if you fed the generator and kept the battery topped off.

It was the kind of place you could pretend was abandoned while still being maintained, because nobody wanted to be the person who admitted they’d let it rot.

I got up there around late afternoon with a pack, a thermos, and a clipboard. The sun was low enough that it turned the treetops copper. From the cab you could see the whole back side of the park: ridgelines folding into each other, cut by long shadows and a few pale scars where lightning fires had burned years ago.

The tower creaked in the wind the way all towers do. Not dangerous creaking. Just the sound of wood and metal remembering they’re tall.

Inside, everything smelled like dust, pine pitch, and old coffee.

There was a laminated sheet tacked by the radios with three bullet points in bold.

DO NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE OVER UNMONITORED FREQUENCIES.

If you are lost, stay put. Use emergency phones or 911. If you hear a voice directing you off-trail, do not respond.

Somebody had underlined the last line twice, hard enough to emboss the plastic.

I remember smirking at it when I first saw it. Not because it was funny, but because it was such a weird thing to have to write down. It felt like superstition in a workplace that runs on checklists.

I did my first call-in with dispatch. Gave them my location, weather read, and the fact I had a clear view of the southern ridge. They logged it, told me to call again at 2100, and that was that.

The first few hours were quiet.

I made coffee on a little camp stove. I filled out a logbook nobody reads unless something goes wrong. I watched the light fade. The forest below turned into one solid dark mass with only the service road cutting a faint line through it.

The tower radio for the lookout was an old handheld unit plugged into a charging cradle by the window. Someone had wrapped the antenna base with a band of black electrical tape, and the casing had a crescent-shaped gouge on the bottom left corner, like it had been dropped on rock years ago and never repaired. The faceplate sticker was so sun-faded you could barely read it, but if you tilted it just right, you could make out the handwritten block letters: LOOKOUT 3.

Around 2030, the radio squelched and popped in a way that made my shoulders lift automatically. You don’t ignore that sound, not out there.

“Lookout Three, dispatch,” came the voice. “You copy?”

I pressed the transmit. “Copy. Go ahead.”

There was a pause, then dispatch again. “We got some weird traffic earlier. Not on our main. Just letting you know in case you hear it.”

I glanced at the laminated sheet by the radio.

“Define weird,” I said.

Dispatch sounded tired. Same operator I’d talked to a hundred times, the kind who can sound calm even when there’s a crash on the highway and someone’s screaming in the background.

“Unmonitored channel. Someone calling for ranger assistance. Using the word ‘lookout.’”

My stomach tightened a little. “Someone knows there’s a tower up here.”

“Yeah,” dispatch said. “Probably kids. Or someone with an old radio. You’re not to answer anything that isn’t us. If you hear it, log it. That’s all.”

I looked at the underlined line on the laminated sheet and felt my earlier smirk dry up.

“Copy,” I said. “I won’t engage.”

I meant it.

At 2100, I called dispatch with my update. Wind had picked up. Temperature dropping. Visibility still good.

“Copy,” dispatch said. “If you hear anything unusual, do not respond. Do not leave the tower. Rangers are already stretched thin.”

“Copy,” I repeated.

I remember looking at the stairs after that. The trapdoor that led down. The way the tower’s shadow cut across the catwalk in the moonlight. I remember thinking, for no logical reason, that it would be easy to step out and go down and check the perimeter, just to prove to myself nothing was out there.

I didn’t do it.

I locked the trapdoor like I always do in old structures, because it keeps the wind from rattling it. I set my flashlight beside the logbook. I sat in the chair by the window and listened to the tower creak.

At 2217, the radio squelched again, but this time it wasn’t dispatch.

Not a call sign. Not a proper prefix.

Just a soft click, then a voice, thin through static.

“Ranger…?”

I froze with my coffee halfway to my mouth.

I didn’t touch the transmit button.

The voice came again, a little clearer. “Ranger, I need help.”

It sounded like a man trying to keep panic down. Breathing too fast. Words clipped. The kind of voice you hear right before people do something stupid.

I stared at the radio like it was going to bite me.

The laminated sheet was right there in my peripheral vision. The underlined warning felt like it was aimed directly at me.

Do not respond.

I sat still.

The voice on the unmonitored channel tried again. “I’m on Trail Six, I think. I’m lost. I can’t find the pull-off. Ranger station, do you copy?”

Trail Six was on the back side. It wasn’t the busiest trail, but it wasn’t obscure. People wandered on it all the time thinking it was “easy.”

My thumb hovered over transmit, then stopped.

I told myself I could call dispatch. That’s the right move. Log it. Let someone with authority decide if it’s real.

I picked up the handset for the main dispatch channel.

Before I could key it, the unmonitored channel voice came again, lower now.

“I can hear you up there,” it said. “Please.”

My throat went dry.

You could hear the tower. The generator hum. The wind.

But “hear you up there” made it feel like there was a line between us that wasn’t radio at all.

I keyed dispatch.

“Dispatch, Lookout Three.”

“Go ahead,” dispatch said immediately, alert now.

“I’m receiving traffic on an unmonitored frequency. Caller claims lost on Trail Six. Says he can hear me up here.”

There was a pause, then dispatch again, quieter. “Do not engage. We’ll send a unit to check Trail Six access points. Stay in the tower. Confirm you’re secure.”

“I’m secure,” I said. “Trapdoor locked.”

“Copy,” dispatch said. “Do not leave. Do not respond.”

I set the handset down.

On the unmonitored channel, the man’s voice changed.

It went flat for a second, like the emotion dropped out.

Then it said, in my own voice, “Lookout Three, dispatch.”

I felt my stomach drop in a way I haven’t felt since I was a kid and a car spun out on ice right in front of me.

It wasn’t a perfect recording quality. It was radio-thin. But it was my cadence. My breath. The tiny throat-clear I do without thinking before I speak.

The radio clicked again, and my own voice repeated, “Go ahead.”

I didn’t move.

I didn’t even breathe right.

The unmonitored channel kept going like it was practicing.

“My location, weather read…”

It was pulling phrases out of context, stitching them together like a puppet.

I grabbed the lookout radio and turned the volume down until the speaker was barely audible. Not off. I couldn’t bring myself to turn it off. Off felt like it would be worse, like closing your eyes when you’re sure something is still there.

I wrote in the logbook with a shaking hand.

2217: Unmonitored traffic. Male voice. Trail Six. Mimicked my call sign and dispatch phrasing.

I underlined mimicked twice, hard enough the pen tore the paper.

The tower creaked.

Outside, the wind rose and fell.

Then I heard something that wasn’t radio at all.

A knock.

Not on the trapdoor.

On the base of the tower, far below.

One heavy knock, metal on wood.

I stood so fast the chair scraped.

I leaned toward the floor hatch, listening.

Another knock.

Then, faintly, a voice from below, carried up through the stairwell like someone standing at the bottom and shouting carefully.

“Ranger!”

My skin tightened.

No one should have been down there. The access road is gated at night. There are signs. There are cameras, even if they’re old.

I moved to the window and looked down.

The base of the tower was a black shape among darker trees. The moonlight didn’t reach the ground well.

I saw nothing.

Then the voice came again, from directly below the tower, and it sounded like dispatch.

“Lookout Three, come down. We need you.”

My mouth went numb.

Dispatch would never tell me to leave the tower at night for a lost camper without sending a unit. Dispatch would never use that tone, like it was urgent and casual at the same time.

I reached for the main dispatch handset.

“Dispatch, Lookout Three,” I said, forcing my voice steady. “Confirm you did not send anyone to tower base.”

Dispatch answered instantly, and there was something in the operator’s voice I hadn’t heard before.

A tightness.

“Negative,” dispatch said. “No units at your location. Stay in the tower. Do not open the hatch.”

As she spoke, the voice from below overlapped her.

“Open the hatch.”

Same words. Same rhythm.

Not through the radio speaker.

Through the stairs.

It was like the tower itself was relaying it.

I backed away from the trapdoor until my shoulders hit the opposite wall.

Dispatch kept talking, faster now. “Listen to me. Do not respond to any voice that is not on this channel. Do not open the tower. Units are en route to the access road. Do you understand?”

“I understand,” I said, but my voice came out thin.

Below, the knocking started again. Slow. Patient.

Knock.

Pause.

Knock.

Like it knew I was counting.

The unmonitored radio channel hissed in the background, even with the volume low, and through it I heard my own voice whispering, “Please.”

I don’t know what did it.

I’ve replayed the next part a hundred times and I still can’t point to a single moment where my brain broke. It wasn’t a sudden decision. It was like a series of tiny rationalizations stacking up until I couldn’t see the drop-off anymore.

Maybe someone really was down there. Maybe a hiker found the tower and was terrified. Maybe dispatch was wrong and a unit had already made it to the base. Maybe, if I just cracked the hatch and called down, I could clear it up.

Maybe the laminated sheet was for something else.

Maybe I was being dramatic.

I hate myself for the thought even now, but there was another thing too.

The voice from below sounded like my brother.

My younger brother has been dead for three years. Car accident. Wrong place, wrong time, drunk driver.

I hadn’t heard his voice in a long time, not cleanly, not without memory blurring it.

From below the tower, through the stairwell, came his voice, small like he was trying not to scare me.

“Hey,” it said. “It’s cold.”

I felt my eyes sting.

I stepped toward the hatch like a sleepwalker.

Dispatch was still in my ear, but it sounded far away now, like a TV in another room.

I unlocked the trapdoor.

The second the lock turned, the knocking stopped.

The silence that followed wasn’t dramatic. It was just empty.

I pulled the hatch up an inch and peered down into the stairwell.

Blackness. A faint smell of damp wood and old rust.

I didn’t see anyone.

I didn’t hear breathing.

Then, from halfway down the stairs, the radio crackle sound happened again, but it wasn’t coming from the lookout radio.

It was coming from the stairwell itself, like static in the air.

And my brother’s voice said softly, “Come on.”

I opened the hatch fully.

The cold air that came up was wrong. It wasn’t just night air. It smelled sour, like wet fur and something metallic.

I backed up, hand on my flashlight.

Dispatch’s voice sharpened. “Lookout Three, what are you doing? Confirm you are in the tower and the hatch is secured.”

I lied.

“In the tower,” I said. “Hatch secured.”

The words tasted like pennies.

I don’t know why I lied. Maybe because part of me already knew I was about to do something I couldn’t explain.

I grabbed my flashlight and stepped down into the stairwell.

The tower groaned as my weight shifted onto the stairs.

Each step down felt like stepping into thicker air. The darkness pressed in tight around the flashlight beam, making it feel small and weak. The metal railing was cold under my hand.

Halfway down, the beam caught something on a step.

A strip of reflective tape.

Park trail marker tape.

It was stuck to the metal like someone had pressed it there.

I stopped. My heart hammered.

That tape shouldn’t have been inside the tower. Nobody comes up here and starts peeling markers off trees to decorate.

The voice from below didn’t rush me.

It just said, patient, “Almost there.”

I kept going.

At the bottom, the tower’s base platform was open to the air. From there you step onto the ground, onto packed dirt and needles. The flashlight beam swept across the base supports, the old maintenance box, the little post where the fire extinguisher used to hang.

No person.

No ranger truck.

No fresh footprints.

I stood at the base of the tower and felt the night press in from all sides.

“Ranger?” I called, and my voice sounded too loud.

Nothing answered.

Then the lookout radio, still up in the cab, crackled faintly through the structure.

And in my own voice, it said, “Here.”

The word came from the trees to my left too, at the exact same time.

“Here.”

Like two speakers playing the same track.

My stomach dropped hard enough I almost gagged.

I backed toward the tower stairs.

The flashlight beam caught movement between two trunks.

Not a full shape. Just a shift. Something tall adjusting its weight.

I swung the light fully and saw it.

It was upright, but it wasn’t standing like a man. It looked assembled wrong. Too thin. Too long. Arms hanging low with too many joints.

The head was not antlers, not a clean skull like you see in cheap horror. It was like skin pulled tight over something sharp. Ridges under the surface. A mouth that didn’t sit right on the face, stretched farther than it should be.

The worst part was the eyes.

Not glowing. Not bright.

Dull, wet reflections in the flashlight beam, like stones at the bottom of a creek.

It didn’t charge.

It stepped forward once, quiet and confident, closing distance in a way my brain couldn’t map properly.

I turned and ran.

I hit the stairs and took them two at a time, boots clanging on metal. My hands shook so hard I nearly missed the railing.

Behind me, something moved through brush without crashing. It sounded like it knew exactly where to place its weight.

I got five steps up before a sound like a dry throat clicking came from right below the tower, closer than it should have been.

I looked down without meaning to.

It was on the first landing already, climbing without haste, long limbs folding wrong.

My flashlight beam caught its hands on the rail.

Hands like bundled sticks. Fingers too long, too many joints, gripping like clamps.

I bolted up again, lungs burning.

The tower creaked in protest, like it hated being part of this.

I hit the trapdoor platform and shoved the hatch up, scrambling through. My shoulder slammed the frame. Pain shot down my arm, but I didn’t care.

I got one knee into the cab and reached back to slam the hatch—

—and something caught me.

Not a grip. A swipe.

A fast, cold rake across my back through my shirt, like dragging a handful of bent nails from shoulder blade to ribs.

The pain didn’t even register right away. It was heat and shock and a breath that turned into a noise I didn’t recognize as mine.

I fell forward into the cab, slammed my palms on the floor, and kicked back hard. The hatch dropped. Wood thudded into place.

Then the burning hit full force.

I scrambled upright and fumbled for the lock. It didn’t align. My hands were shaking too much.

Below me, the hatch bumped once, gently, as if something had tested it.

Then again.

I shoved my weight onto it and finally got the lock to catch with a metallic click.

I pressed my back against the far wall of the cab and felt wetness spreading under my shirt. The scratches stung with every breath, each inhale pulling at torn fabric and skin like the injury wanted to remind me it was there.

Dispatch was still on my actual channel, voice edged with panic now.

“Lookout Three, respond. Respond now.”

Under my feet, another voice repeated her exact words a half-second later, using her tone so well it made my teeth ache.

I forced myself to key dispatch.

“It’s at the tower,” I said, words coming out in ragged pieces. “It mimics. It got into the stairwell. It—”

My voice hitched when my back spasmed.

Dispatch didn’t waste time asking what it was. “Stay away from the hatch. Barricade if you can. Units are two minutes out.”

The hatch bumped again, harder.

A sound like claws, or nails, dragging along the wood.

My stomach rolled. My back was on fire. I could taste copper at the back of my throat from biting down too hard.

I grabbed the heavy chair and shoved it over the hatch.

Then I grabbed the small table and jammed it against the chair.

The tower shook slightly, and for the first time I realized the thing wasn’t just testing the hatch.

It was putting weight on the tower.

Like it was climbing the supports.

The windows rattled.

The catwalk outside the cab gave a soft metallic ping as something stepped onto it.

The flashlight beam caught a shadow pass over the window.

Tall.

Too thin.

I backed away until I hit the far wall of the cab, my back screaming, and I nearly blacked out from the sudden flare of pain.

The radio shrieked with static. Not dispatch. The other channel.

And then, in my own voice, right in the speaker by my ear, it said softly, “Come down.”

The window behind me thudded once, like something tapped it with a knuckle.

Then again, harder.

I saw the outline press against the glass for a split second. Not a face, not clear, just a suggestion of that stretched mouth and ridged head.

The glass bowed.

It didn’t break, but it flexed enough to make me realize how old it was. How many winters it had seen. How many times it had been heated and cooled and stressed.

The thing outside didn’t rush. It didn’t slam wildly.

It tapped. Then waited. Then tapped again.

Like it knew time was on its side.

Dispatch was still talking, telling me to hold, to stay put, that headlights were on the access road, that they were almost there.

I believed her.

And then the voice on the other side of the glass said, in my brother’s voice again, small and cold, “I’m scared.”

That almost got me.

I won’t lie.

My hand moved toward the hatch without permission. A reflex built from a lifetime of responding to voices asking for help.

I stopped myself by biting down on the inside of my cheek until I tasted blood.

The tapping on the window stopped.

For a few seconds, the tower was still except for my breathing and the faint crackle of radios and the slow drip of something warm down my side under my shirt.

Then something scraped across the roof.

Slow.

Like fingernails being dragged along metal.

The sound traveled from one end of the roof to the other, then stopped above my head.

I looked up without meaning to.

The ceiling was thin paneling. If something heavy sat on it, the whole cab would feel it.

The tower creaked, a deep groan, like it was taking a breath.

And then the hatch behind my barricade bumped from below again.

Two directions.

It was on the roof and under the floor.

Or it wanted me to think it was.

Then headlights washed the trees below in white beams, sweeping back and forth.

A ranger truck.

Another.

Radios on the dispatch channel erupted with voices. Call signs. Orders. Real human urgency.

The scraping on the roof stopped immediately.

The tapping stopped.

The pressure under the hatch eased.

For one shaky breath, I thought it was over. That it would retreat when there were more people.

Then, over the unmonitored channel, in dispatch’s exact voice, came a calm instruction.

“Units, proceed off-road. Follow the voice.”

I heard a ranger on the main channel hesitate. “Dispatch, confirm.”

Dispatch snapped, real and sharp. “Negative. Stay on the road. Do not go off-road. Do not follow any voice.”

And then, like it was enjoying itself, the unmonitored channel repeated her denial in her voice but with a tiny twist, like a smile hidden in it.

“Proceed.”

Below, one of the trucks turned its lights toward the tree line, and for a brief second I saw the shape at the edge of the beams.

Tall.

Too thin.

Half-hidden like it didn’t want to be fully seen.

Then it stepped back into the woods and the darkness swallowed it.

The rangers stayed on the road. They didn’t chase. They didn’t play hero. They swept the area, found nothing, and told me to stay in the cab until morning.

When daylight came, they walked me down the tower with two people on either side like I was the fragile one.

Halfway down, my shirt had dried stiff against my back. Every step made the scratches flare again, like the air itself was cutting me.

At the base, one of the rangers asked, “You hit something?”

I shook my head once, because I didn’t know how to answer without sounding like a lunatic.

At the park office later, I tried to explain what happened in a way that didn’t make me sound like I’d lost my mind in the dark. I talked about radio interference. About prank calls. About an animal under the tower.

The older clerk behind the counter didn’t laugh.

She slid a binder toward me, opened to a page that looked like it had been read too many times.

Incident reports. Dates. Channels. Notes about mimicry and unmonitored frequencies.

At the bottom of the page was a line underlined twice.

If it uses your voice, it already has you.

They sent me to urgent care in town anyway, the way they do when paperwork starts to smell like liability. The nurse didn’t ask many questions. She just had me turn around, lifted my shirt carefully, and went quiet for a second.

“You got lucky,” she said.

They cleaned the scratches, bandaged them in long strips, and told me to watch for infection. The back of my shirt went into a plastic bag like evidence. I drove home with my shoulders tight, trying not to move too much because every shift tugged at the raw lines under the gauze.

I quit volunteering the next week.

Not out of fear of the woods in general. I can walk a trail in daylight and enjoy it like anyone.

I quit because I learned something I can’t unlearn.

There are rules out there that aren’t about bears or weather or dehydration. There are rules about what happens when you ask for help the wrong way, on the wrong channel, in the wrong place.

And there’s one more detail I haven’t told anyone in the park system because I don’t want to see the look on their faces.

Sometime after midnight, a couple nights later, I finally fell asleep in my own bed.

I woke up at 2:17 a.m. exactly.

Not the slow drift up from a dream. The kind where your eyes open and your body is already tight, like it heard something before your brain caught up.

My back ached under the bandages. I could feel the scabbed lines pulling every time I breathed too deep.

The apartment was quiet. No cars. No neighbors. The heater clicked once and stopped.

Then I heard it.

Not from outside.

From inside the room.

A soft burst of static, like a speaker waking up.

A click.

My throat closed. I sat up so fast the sheet tangled around my legs.

The sound came again, clearer now. Static, then a tiny, controlled squelch, like someone had keyed a mic and let go.

It wasn’t my phone. My phone was on the dresser, dark and charging.

I swung my bedside lamp on.

The light filled the room, bright and normal, and for half a second my brain tried to calm down. Tried to tell me it was nothing.

Then I saw the green glow.

A faint, sick little rectangle of light coming from the crack under my bedroom door.

My heart started banging hard enough to make my vision pulse.

I got out of bed and limped to the door, barefoot, quiet, holding my breath like it mattered.

I opened it.

The hallway was lit only by the kitchen nightlight. The glow on the floor wasn’t from that.

It was coming from my living room.

I stepped out and followed it, slow, like approaching a trap you can already see.

On my coffee table—centered like someone had placed it carefully—was the tower radio from the lookout.

I knew it instantly.

Not because of the model.

Because I could see the black electrical tape wrapped around the antenna base, and that crescent-shaped gouge on the bottom left corner of the casing—the one I’d noticed because it made the radio sit crooked in its cradle up in the cab. The faceplate sticker was still sun-faded, but in the lamplight I could make out the handwritten block letters if I leaned close enough.

LOOKOUT 3.

And taped to the side of it—pressed flat, neat as a label—was a strip of reflective trail marker tape.

I didn’t touch it.

I just stood there, staring at the radio like it was a live animal.

The speaker crackled again.

Click.

Then my own voice came out of it, patient and calm, the way I sound when I’m trying to keep somebody else from panicking.

“Lookout Three… do you copy?”

I backed up until my shoulders hit the wall, and the movement tugged at my bandages hard enough to make me hiss.

The radio clicked again, and this time it didn’t use my voice.

It used dispatch.

Sharp. Official. Convincing.

“Confirm you are secure.”

I stood there in my hallway, barefoot, shaking, staring at a radio that didn’t belong in my apartment, and I realized something that made my stomach turn cold.

It wasn’t just copying voices.

It wasn’t just playing with a frequency.

It knew where the tower was.

It knew where I lived.

And it knew exactly what words would make me answer.

I didn’t answer.

I didn’t even breathe right.

I walked backward into my bedroom and shut the door and locked it like that meant anything.

The radio kept talking out in my living room, voice changing every few seconds—mine, dispatch, my brother—cycling through the ones that worked best.

I stayed in my room until sunrise, listening to it through the wall like you listen to an intruder moving around your house.

At 6:41 a.m., it went quiet.

No static. No click.

Just silence.

When I finally opened my door, the radio was gone.

There was no mark on the table. No tape. No dust disturbed. No sign it had ever been there.

Except for one thing.

On the hardwood in front of my coffee table, right where the green glow had pooled, was a single strip of reflective tape pressed flat to the floor like a breadcrumb.

I am struggling emotionally today. I woke having flashbacks and flash-forward thinking. (Time Collapse)

I want to be back in WA at my old job. I miss my coworkers, the job, and my life there, but when I thought about how to make the move—even if I pre-had (Boss already said she’d re-rehire me) the job and just needed housing there again—I immediately became anxious and panicked.

The truth is, I am happy enough here in MT, working every day, no days off, with only one double Wednesday (usually). I still haven’t recovered from this last year’s drive across the country twice, from WA, CO to NC then back to MT.

I still have many mistakes i need to clean up from this last years Dissociative Identity take over.

I have a lifetime subscription to the minimalist lifestyle now. Anytime I even think about buying a non-necessary item, I start getting hives. I broke and did buy a 4-qt. crockpot because the 3-qt. wasn’t available, due to needing cost-effective meals.

 I get plenty of free food and coffee at both jobs, so I won’t starve, but I need my cabbage and veggie soup back, as my waistline isn’t doing well against the freebies.

I have very little now, but I can still see ways I can downsize and will be cutting back more, as it makes me feel more in control and less weighed down by things.

Sadly, I think my one camping fork that goes to a set accidentally went out with the garbage, as Buddha and Eris regularly knock things into the one garbage off the counter/side table. So do i buy a new set that clips together or try to probably no avail find a fork to add to my old set which I liked?

My priorities have changed across the board. I am very happy to still have Buddha snd Eris and no vehicle payments.(at the moment)

My biggest splurge...vapes and occasionally gas station coffee and snacks. 

Got into a Harlan Coben last night and finished. Charles Bukowski seems to be closer to what I write sometimes I am told and Sylvia Plath.

I (18M) graduated high school this past spring. Though I am a good student, hadn't gotten a single B all throughout high school, take mostly AP and dual credit classes, there are some teachers that are less than fond of me. To be completely upfront and honest I like learning things my way and get pissed off when people try to make me do it their way. 

This proved to be an issue a few weeks before school ended. In one of my classes, my teacher (I'll call her Mrs. H) is absolutely awful at teaching. Slowly, I ended up just studying on my own during the class. I originally just pulled up online notes about the topic and listened to the lecture while also reading the notes. I then realized that the lecture was pulled almost word for word from Kahn Academy. With this, I just completely tuned out of the class, put in my air pods, and did my own work. After this my grades on exams increased and just generally felt like I knew more about the subject.

I sat front row of my class, the table positioned so that her desk was right behind me about four feet away. She could see my laptop and what I was doing and also assumed she had no problem with it considering when she told people to put their devices and laptops away, she never said anything to me about it. Additionally, I had other classes where my teachers are fully aware of my preference to learn alone and are fine with it. It turned out that she actually was not aware. 

About two or three weeks before the AP exam, I was taking notes over a topic they had covered last class, since I had skipped it to go study for a different class. I knew it would not take me long and I'd be able to catch up fine since I am usually a few topics ahead of the class anyway. I heard my teacher call my name and I took out my air pod, and she asked what I was doing. I said I was working on stuff from last period. She said I needed to follow along with the class and I can't be doing my work all alone. Now this is where I should have just shut up and agreed, but I was genuinely confused so I just said, ""but I've been doing this all semester."" She just kind of went quiet and told me to just follow along with the class for now and close my laptop and pay attention, and that we'd talk after class.

Here, I just assumed that she would tell me off for having both air pods in since, I admit, I got too comfortable with that. But when she called me up at the end of class, she just glared at me and said, ""that was extremely disrespectful"". She continued to tell me how I should be following along and paying attention and that not doing so is a lack of respect. I said that that is just how I learn best though. She then responded again, saying it is extremely disrespectful. I responded by saying ""I really don't think it is."" I feel that it is also worth mentioning I was taking this class for fun, I already had a college credit for this subject because I had taken it the summer before at my local community college. Anyways, this went back and forth, with her eventually saying ""well I'm sorry that I'm such a bad teacher for you"" and walking out of the classroom for her lunch break. I know I was being extremely petty but after, since the school was on block schedule and I didn't feel like dealing with her BS I didn't go to her class the rest of the year, instead skipping and going to study at a bookstore, and I felt vindicated when I got the 5 on my exam. I know it's stupid, my friends and girlfriend said I blew it out of proportion, but I really don't like people who are bad at their jobs telling me what to do.

When it entered summer though it became super fucking weird. Mrs. H followed me on Instagram. Now I don't think this is inherently weird, I follow some of my former teachers on social media platforms and have the numbers of the ones I was really close with. Mrs. H however, I have no idea why she would want to be friends with me. She DM'ed me saying that she was going to have a dinner with some former students and asked if I wanted to come. Again, I don't think this is inherently weird because I have gone to dinner with some friends and former teachers. But again, I don't like her. Eventually, she said one of my close friends were coming, which he confirmed when I asked him, so I said yes.

 Cut to a week later, I go to the restraunt to find her at a table for two, only two. I asked where everyone else was and she said they all had to cancel. I got really weird bad vibes and was really confused. From there she started to sort of flirt. She started to touch my hand on the table and threw her head back laughing at almost everything I said, none of which was meant to be a joke. I went to the bathroom eventually and texted my friend who was supposed to be there why he wasn't here. He said that she had called the dinner off saying she had a family emergency. I kind of freaked out here and just wanted to leave. I was super uncomfortable and when I came back to the table just told her this first thing I could think of, which was that I needed to go home, and my mom had said my dad was in a really bad accident (this lie would bite me in the ass later). I left some cash on the table to pay for my food and left. I feel it is also important to mention that my birthday is later in the summer, so I was still 17 at this time, my birthday still wasn't for another month.

From there, she would keep commenting on my Instagram posts, fairly innocuous things like ""hope college is treating you well!"" And I didn't really think about it, but then she would start responding to my stories. I'm from the south but moved to Canada for college. Fair to say, the winter is kicking my ass, but the snow is pretty, so I like to take pictures and post on my story. She responds talking about how much she wished she could be there with me and experience the snow together. On one particular occasion, I posted my girlfriend for her birthday. We're still together from high school, and long distance really hasn't been that hard for us., making sure to talk and communicate as much we can. When I posted her though Mrs. H responded saying she was surprised we were still together and asking if there weren't any ""better"" women to be with. I was at this point just so fucking confused on why she was insisting to keep in contact considering I never would even respond to her.

I'm currently back home in the states for winter break and she has seemed to not forget that, asking if I wanted to go get coffee or do dinner again. However, last week, she completely blew up at me. In the summer I completely lied about my dad having an accident. This is a particularly stupid lie because my dad died three years ago. She found out about this and completely blew up at me, saying I ruined our time together and the relationship we had. When I asked how she knew this she said she found it on my mom's Facebook. I was just so done at this point; I blocked her on every platform I could find. Now though she's made multiple new accounts and somehow found my phone numb er and is messaging, not only me, but also my friends, family, and even roommate. The messages are just all about how much she hates me. She's threatening to get me kicked out of my college (how, I don't know) and sending me messages of how much she hates me, and I deserve to die. I'm extremely freaked out now and I have no idea what to do. No matter how many I block it feels like five more new numbers or accounts pop up. What the hell do I do and is there any way I can make her stop? Is this considered stalking? I'm just exhausted from just a week of this, and me and my mom haven't found any solution. Is it reasonable to pursue legal action?",1,1768259037.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1qbad4o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qbad4o,Recovery meal plan day 123,"Breakfast - porridge, honey, strawberries, yogurt and a coffee with sugar 10/10 

Lunch - chicken and ham mayo bap, cheese, tomatoes and a kiwi 10/10 (back to my baps and this is so good, chicken and ham is so underrated)

Snack - cheese, cream cheese, ham and crackers 10/10 

Dinner - chicken, pilau rice and broccoli with soy sauce 8.5/10 (I can't tell if I actually like pilau rice, it has such a weird taste that I kinda enjoy, its weird but rice and soy sauce is the best)

Dessert - Walkers shortbread finger, M&S dark chocolate digestive, Lindt teddy and a galaxy caramel 11/10 (these digestives were insane - a new favourite for sure!)

Snack - sourdough, kerrygold butter and strawberry jam 10/10 

Snack - digestives with lurpak butter and banana and strawberries with yogurt 10/10 (love yogurt and banana!) 

Challenge - meet my energy - achieved 

New food - Dark chocolate digestives - honestly SO good, highly recommend, they are made with Demerara sugar which creates an amazing texture - a new favourite for sure. 

Today was slightly better than yesterday. Food noise is still loud but I am also finding food not as exciting or special anymore, which kinda scares me. Like I don't feel as excited about my treat plates anymore and I am not ravenously hungry for all my meals and snacks anymore which makes eating feel not worth it, I am struggling massively with this. I do however still struggle with food indecision because I want evevrytung t be perfect. But I think this more comes from I don't want anything to let me down because I know then the next evening/day that meal or snack becomes more difficult - if that makes sense. 

Dad has been a nightmare again, but I feel bad venting on here about it. No one need to hear about the ramblings of an alcoholic. Basically he keeps saying he will change - he never does. 

I got trained on a new department in work today which was difficult because it wasn't my usual routine. But I needed up really enjoying it in the end - YAY. Bread trained now lol. 

The temptation to give up is quite strong at the minuet - because like I said food isn't exciting, body image is crap, life is pretty shit with dad and the safety of the illness is tempted asf. Feeling invalid in my recovery sucks but I know I am wise enough to realise it is the illness - not the reality, I do not want to go back .... despite the temptation.

It just is scary, I have to do this everyday!? It all feels very overwhelming 🥲",10,1768259025.0,recoveryplates,2,1.0,False

First time having this one and it was so nice it lasted me all of 40 minutes.  Lots of baking spice and honey with undertones of cocoa and espresso that rounds out with a nutty, bready, woody, and slightly creamy character.  Dry, yet smooth from beginning to end with aroma and flavor that kept me puffing til my mustache sizzled and said uncle.  ",4,1768259016.0,cigar_refuge,0,0.84,False

I feel like I'm living on knife's edge; If I get **<9 hours**, I develop **flu-like symptoms**.

* **1 night (7 hrs vs 9):** extreme nausea, exhaustion, dizziness on standing, sore throat, stinging eyes, bleeding gums/lips, low-grade fever. Not contagious
* **3 days (8 hrs vs 9):** very severe illness with **102 fevers**, worsened symptoms, **7–10 day recovery**. Contagious, but others exposed get slightly sick and recover in 2 days.

**Workup:** several PCPs, 2 immunologists, hematology, ENT, sleep specialists. Extensive labs normal; sleep study “textbook” great sleep efficiency/quality. 23andMe genetic test shows **one FMF variant** (told typically need two).

**Potential clue?- Autonomic Hyper-Arousal:** I cannot sleep through noise. A sink running or a floor creakiing wakes me even in Deep/REM sleep. I am also extremely sensitive to stimulants (one coffee lasts 18+ hours) 

**Circadian Sleep Wake Phase Disorder:** On top of my 9 hour sleep need, I have a genetic mutation that runs in my family where sleep onset/melatonin is delayed. It is not insomia, but permanent jetlag where my biological clock runs later. Through treatment, I shifted from a 4am-1pm to 1-10am sleep schedule.

At age 18, extreme sensitivity to lack of sleep started. My baseline for tolerance of sleep debt continues to get worse every few months. I feel like no one truly understands that I cannot function if I wake up before 10am. Does anybody have any idea of what this could be and any possible solutions?
