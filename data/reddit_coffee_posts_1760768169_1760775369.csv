1o9q54i,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTravelers/comments/1o9q54i/where_to_find_cotswolds_day_trips_including_lunch/,Where to find Cotswolds day trips including lunch?,"Just got back from an incredible day trip to the Cotswolds, and I need to share this hidden gem with you all. After weeks of research trying to find the perfect tour from London, I finally found one that includes everything - transportation, lunch, and the most picturesque villages you can imagine.

I discovered this small-group tour that hits all the major spots while keeping things intimate - no massive tourist buses here. The thing I appreciated most was how they took care of all the logistics, which meant I could focus on soaking in the beauty of the English countryside.

The day starts in South Kensington, London, at a cozy coffee shop called Urban Baristas. Our guide met us bright and early at 8:25 AM, and from there, we headed straight into the heart of the Cotswolds. The air-conditioned vehicle made the journey comfortable, and our guide shared fascinating stories about the region's history throughout the drive.

Our first stop was Burford, often called the ""Gateway to the Cotswolds."" The high street is lined with buildings that have stood for over 600 years - it's like stepping back in time. I spent an hour exploring the local shops and taking photos of the honey-colored stone buildings that make this region famous.

Then came Bibury, which honestly looks like it belongs on a postcard. Arlington Row, with its ancient weavers' cottages, is probably the most photographed spot in the Cotswolds. The river running through the village adds to its charm, and I got some incredible shots for my Instagram.

The highlight for me was lunch in Bourton-on-the-Water. We had about 90 minutes here, which gave us plenty of time to enjoy our meal and explore what's often called the ""Venice of the Cotswolds."" The lunch was included in the tour price, which was a nice bonus.

Our final stop was Stow-on-the-Wold, and this was particularly special for any Lord of the Rings fans out there. The ancient doors of St. Edward's Church supposedly inspired Tolkien's gates of Moria. The antique shops here are amazing - I could have spent hours browsing.

What made this tour stand out was the small group size (maximum 16 people) and our knowledgeable guide who showed us spots we would never have found on our own. At $122.19 per person, it's excellent value considering it includes transport, lunch, and a full day of guided exploration.

If you're planning to visit the Cotswolds, I highly recommend booking this tour. You can secure your spot here: https://athomewave.com/Cotswolds. The best part is they offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before, and you can reserve now and pay later.

Personal tip: Book in advance - I noticed this tour gets booked up quickly, especially during peak season. With over 2,300 positive reviews and a 97% recommendation rate from travelers, it's clear why this is one of the most popular Cotswolds day trips from London.

Just thinking about those charming villages and rolling hills makes me want to go back. It's the perfect escape from London's hustle and bustle, and having everything organized for you makes it completely stress-free.",1,1760775074.0,WeAreTravelers,0,1.0,False

He’s been making any excuse to talk to her. He touches with pats on the back. I trust my girlfriend and he knows about me but he only found out about me a couple of weeks ago when I stopped by and brought my girlfriend Starbucks because I was on vacation and wanted to surprise her favorite coffee and food so she can eat. Up to this point I didn’t like the guy but I wasn’t bothered by him.

Soon after he saw me he started bringing me up by asking how old I was and that I looked old to him. My girlfriend was like “Wtf? He’s 30 how old did you think he was?” Which he responded with “31 - 32.” Which she told him that he looks his age and moved on. Another incident she told me about was him asking if I’ve ever took her to a gun range and after she said no he started questioning my manhood? Now I’ve been shooting a few times and I do enjoy it every once in a while which she told him but she doesn’t enjoy it. After these instances I’ve grown to really dislike this guy because now I feel he’s attacking my character to try and swoon my GF.

Fast forward to two nights ago. Both of us get in to an argument and my girlfriend asks for space and essentially kicked me out of her place. In the morning the next day I wanted to surprise her with Starbucks before I go in to work and she did her hair and makeup. I didn’t think anything of it. I went to give her the items and she just has this cold look on her. I pushed past it gave her the Starbucks, kissed her and told her I hoped she has a good day and that I love her. That’s when I walked out. I called her for lunch and as we were talking a bit about the fight the day before I mentioned her hair and makeup and asked if her coworker made any comment. She didn’t want to tell me which I was confused. I asked again and she said he told her she looked cute. I was bothered by that. I got upset and asked her to set some boundaries with him. She just responded with “He knows about you already. I’m not doing anything. At least he told me I looked good. You just looked at me and handed me Starbucks like that was going to fix this…” I told her I didn’t make a comment because things felt really awkward and I got the feeling that she didn’t want to see me so I left. Now, I always comment on her looks. I tell her she’s beautiful every chance I get. I got angry after the comment because it seemed like she enjoyed the attention from him and defended him. I wanted to go and have a talk with him but my friends told me not to. I’m not going to but I can’t get past this situation. Did I overreact by telling my girlfriend to set boundaries with this guy and getting upset at the situation?",1,1760774934.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Many were influenced by the hype around mushroom coffee but, after using it consistently for quite a period of time, are unable to see any real results.

It is obvious that the popularity of functional coffee has increased due to the health advantages it claims to offer, which naturally leads to frustration if people fail to experience them. So, is it the fault of the mushroom coffee brand they are using?

Definitely not. Yes, it is important to choose a brand carefully by checking proportions, extraction processes, and the quantity of beta-glucans per serving, as these are crucial for the effectiveness of mushroom coffee. However, there are additional factors that are equally important in order to enjoy its maximum benefits.

1o9q3c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o9q3c0/would_you_use_a_booktracking_websiteapp_that_lets/,"Would You Use a Book-Tracking Website/app that Lets You Create Custom 3D ""Mood Nooks""","I'm thinking about designing a book-tracking website/app because existing ones feel like glorified spreadsheets. I want to turn a digital library into a series of beautiful, personalized spaces—your very own Reading Nooks.

I am not selling anything. I just want to see if people actually want, what I think is a pretty cool project.

The core idea is this- Instead of one static list, you can create multiple, distinct Nooks. Each Nook is designed to match the specific vibe of the book (or books) you're reading at that moment or overall genre like fantasy.

Here's a breakdown of the features I'm working on. Let me know if this sounds like something you'd actually use!



You start by picking a room size (small cozy or medium) and then customize everything to match your current read-

Custom Layout Overhauls- Set a theme for your space with presets like Cyberpunk Den (for sci-fi), Medieval Tavern (for fantasy), Winter Lodge (for a cozy classic), or Mystery Study. These change the walls, floors, and window frames. This doesn’t change the layout structure, just the detail of the walls, floor, and window frames.



Ambient Features- Add immersive background sounds that make you feel like you're in the book's setting-

* Rain/Thunder/Wind from the window.
* A crackling Fireplace or a bubbling Mini Fountain.
* Coffee Pot that adds coffee shop noise.
* Wind Chimes or a gently Ticking Clock.



Memorabilia & Identity- Place Symbolic Items (""Mementos"") around your Nook, purchased from a in app market that changes what they have. These represent books you've finished, and you decide what each item means to you by attaching custom notes, making the space uniquely yours.

Your books are central to the space and provide satisfying visual cues-

From your nooks, wherever your books are placed - you can then click/tap and it brings you to a ""bookshelf"" - where each book has its own custom spine. You can then create collections and categorize your books with custom label plates. You can then see the custom books from your nook so there is a lot of variation.  The empty spaces on your shelves are also a fun visual cue, encouraging you to fill them up!

Dynamic Spines-

You can set a clean, uniform spine theme for a collection of books, or collect unique custom spines for individual books. - (e.g. dragon skin, ice frost, a bloody drip, etc.)

Progress-Based Spines- As you log pages, the spine of your currently reading book on the table will visually fill up with color or a progress bar—a great motivator!

Format Indicator- Spines feature subtle icons (e-reader, speaker, book texture) to show if it's an eBook, audiobook, or physical copy.

Seamless Goodreads Import- A simple, flawless process to import your entire TBR list so you don't have to manually re-sort anything.

Quarter star ratings

Mood-Based AI Reader- An AI that checks your current mood and asks a series of short questions then suggests your next book *only* from your current TBR list. It helps you find the right book at the right time. - helps tackle that endless TBR list.

Social Nook Visiting- Easily share and visit each other's custom Nooks to browse their collections and check out their designs and memorabilia . You can leave ""Likes"" or ""Upvotes,"" and the most creative Nooks get featured weekly.

Here’s some questions that would help me out greatly. Does the ability to create and switch between multiple, fully customized, immersive Nooks—each built for a specific reading experience—sound like a game-changer for a book-tracking app?

What kind of genre would you create your first Nook for and what would you imagine it to look like?

What features do you really like?

What do you want really badly that’s not included?

What do you dislike or don’t really care for?

My son is 4 months old and sleeps fairly well. I'm a stay at home dad until January. I've developed a bad case of insomnia and just cannot seem to go back to sleep after night feedings. Our son wakes up once at night to feed and then is up around 530-6am. For several nights now I've gotten up the change him after his feeding and then just lay there for basically the rest of the night. 


I wouldn't classify myself as anxious. My thoughts aren't really intrusive. They're just kind of dumb. I spent like half an hour wondering evolutionarily why coconuts developed hair. I spent another hour thinking about an old creek I used to play in when I was young. 

I even tried meditating to sleep. I put on a 45 minute guided sleep meditation, and after 45 minutes was calm AF but still humming along. 


My lifestyle checks all the boxes of good sleep hygiene. I workout like 3-4 times a week. Read books regularly. Stay off my phone before bed. Drink only 1 cup of coffee a day at 7am. Eat a balanced mostly vegetarian diet. Don't drink alcohol or do any drugs. Go to bed around 10.

Previously not have taken then not even 100 days out of the year Previously.  Started back on them in like September of 2024 along with vyvanse no sexual symptoms.  It was 50 mg. In Nov I got dose increase to 100mg to accommodate for an increase in vyvanse.  I never took the increase vyvanse dose and stayed at 40 mg. So with the zoloft I split 2 100mg to 50mg each so I could take it as 50mg over 4 days. 

I immediately noticed the genital numbness in my vagina but clitoris was still sensitive, and emotions stayed intact. Could feel all the substances and erogenous zones. It worsened from then with around February. I started noticing weightlessness,  not being able to feel pain after exercising pr streching,  muted heart beat, but sexual function was still the same. I still responded to sexual stimuli, clitoris still sensitive erogenous zones still in tact, etc. But at this point, I started to lose response to alcohol,  coffee, and other stimulants.  In June, July, I noticed a sort of lack of imagination and creativity.  

Fast forward to now October 2025. Reduced sensation everywhere, I can still orgasm but it's heavily muted, clitoris barely has sensation,  no response to sexual stimuli, and achool coffee no effect. Seems like I can only feel negative emotional, not positive ones. In the absence of negative emotions, I just feel nothing, not happy, not sad, and laughter is forced. I think something is funny but just can not laugh for nothing. Through all libido has never gone away, I frequently think about sex and have the urge to masturbate.

1o9q12k,https://i.redd.it/lzd6wmvzutvf1.jpeg,French Avenue Spectre series review,"Here's a short review of the spectre series, most of them have been macerated for months

**Spectre Wraith** : Smells really dark, heavy woods, coffee and rum base with hints of vanilla. Gets a bit sweeter in the dry down but not sugary sweet and after couple of hours smells a bit vanilla and strong Almond. 

Lasts 6+ hours easily in winters, not at all a blind buy and could be very polarising. But if you can pull it off it's a perfect signature fragrance for winters.


**Spectre Ghost** : This one opens fresh and spicy (ginger, bergamot, cardamom) then settles into creamy vanilla with powdery woods. The combo of spices, Vanilla and Bergamot is really really great. 

The performance may vary but I have the old batch and macerated for months so I get easily 8+ hours performance in winters. 


**Spectre** : Incense, smoky and leathery with hints of saffron sweetness. The leather is not overbearing and is quite balanced with other notes. A safe blind buy for leather based fragrance lovers.

The performance in winters is really great. Lasts easily 6+ hours but you need to be able to pull this off. One of those scents that require a character and physique to suit ya. 


The box packaging and the bottles themselves are really beautiful, one of the boxes I haven't thrown yet. Initially when I bought them and tried they did have alcohol blast but over months of maceration, the notes have improved and no more alcohol in initial spray. Of all three, just the OG is linear while the rest aren't. 
And please, batches are different, skin chemistry is different and I've macerated them for atleast an year! Do let me know your experience with these 👀",6,1760774637.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False

I have very bad anxiety and because of that I can't leave the house alone. The last time I went to the store alone I was still in my teens (I'm 30 now) so it's been like 12-13 years. The best I managed to do (recently) is go on a walk in the woods early in the morning when no-one's there and that was like 2-3 years ago. I know that going to the store is the most normal thing ever but to me, in my current state, it feels like climbing a fucking mountain lol. And yesterday I just *did* it!

I woke up at like 5am or something, fucked around, watched a horror movie with my morning coffee (it's called Moloch and it was very good), dad boiled us some corn for breakfast... now I'm realizing that this routine might be kinda weird but it's not that out of ordinary for me. I showered and washed my hair, changed the sheets and did some mending on my pjs. Around this time I got this crazy burst of energy that just came out of nowhere. I decided I was gonna make a really nice dinner (even though my dad cooks on Fridays and he hates when I mess with his routine). I had all the basic ingredients I needed but I wanted to do something a bit extra so I thought that I'd make dad take me to the store. But dad already went to the store earlier (before I decided that I'll make dinner) and he was grumpy about me messing with his routine and I already told him very confidently that I had things handled. So then I was like '...what if I just did it?' And in that moment I felt like I could actually do it. And I did!

Before I could chicken out I changed and was out the door. When I told my dad I was going for a walk alone he had this look on his face lol he looked so pleasantly surprised. I didn't tell him what I was planning because I still wasn't sure if I could actually pull through and I didn't want the extra pressure of him (or anyone) having higher expectations than I could reach... if that makes sense? Anyway I walked to the store with my head down screaming in my head 'you can do this! you can do this!' the whole time. I was very close to hyperventilating the whole time and walking super fast probably wasn't helping. I calmed down a bit once I was in the store (maybe it felt more familiar? Or maybe it's just cuz I like shopping? Not sure)

I had a bit of an embarrassing moment while buying ginger. Idk what it's like in other places but a lot of stores here have you measure your own fresh ingredients so I was trying to do that but turns out they changed it so the cashier did it at the cash register (should've paid more attention when I went shopping with my parents before). Anyway the cashier saw me fumbling with the scales (was starting to panic a bit because this wasn't part of the plan!) and saved me (bless her). The rest of the shopping went without problem. I got some mushrooms, a can of chickpeas and a very sad looking bunch of green onion (even the cashier noted on how sad it was - but don't worry it was fine in the end).

Going home I walked just as fast - I was covered in sweat by the end. The whole time I was like 'Omg omg I did it! I did it!' lol. When I finally got home I screamed at my dad like 'dad, I did it!' and then I called my mom to brag lol. They were both very happy. It took me a while to calm down I was out of breath for like 20 min after I got home. Later I made dinner and it took me like 3 hours, not because it was a complicated recipe but because I'm still new at cooking so I'm super slow. The fish was the biggest problem - I wanted to remove the bones and the scales and ended up just shredding it completely (thank god my dad didn't see what I did to that thing because I'm pretty sure he would've perma-banned me from the kitchen). Don't worry the fish tasted great and nobody noticed anything was amiss. Everything else tasted great too - except there was too much ginger or the ginger was too strong - idk I put the same amount as last time and it was totally different! But other than the ginger causing issues *again* everything was great. I even arranged it all pretty and it was healthy too.

Anyway I'm very happy with myself, I haven't had a win like this in a while. Now that I've proven to myself that I can do it the next time will be easier... I hope. It honestly still feels like a dream or something - like I can't believe I just *decided* to do something so hard and just *did* it and nothing bad even happened.

Anyway, tnx for reading, I hope you guys are doing well too <3",4,1760774620.0,ForeverAloneWomen,1,1.0,False
1o9q0op,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrettyChaos/comments/1o9q0op/meeting_dani_maye/,Meeting Dani Maye,"Online dating felt like scrolling through a parade of faces that blurred together — the same smiles, the same half-hearted bios, the same “Hey, beautiful” that always felt copied and pasted. But his message was different. Simple. Thoughtful.

He’d written, “Your favorite book is The Secret History? That’s dangerous. You either have excellent taste or questionable judgment.”

I laughed out loud. It wasn’t much, but it was enough.

We started talking — little things at first. Movies, music, the comfort of late-night takeout. His name was Ryan. He lived one city over, worked as a photographer, and had this dry, clever sense of humor that made even bad days lighter. I didn’t realize how much I looked forward to his messages until they became part of my routine — morning texts with sleepy emojis, random midday jokes, long, meandering conversations that stretched past midnight.

After three weeks, he asked if we could meet.

I said yes before I could talk myself out of it.

The day of the date, I stood in front of my mirror, second-guessing everything. My hair was down — long, blonde, and a little wavy. I’d picked a soft cream sweater, jeans, and the gold necklace my mom had given me when I graduated college. I wanted to look nice, but still like me.

We chose a coffee shop downtown — open windows, string lights, the smell of espresso in the air. I got there first, and my heart raced every time the door opened. And then, he walked in.

He looked just like his pictures — tall, dark hair, brown eyes that crinkled when he smiled. But in person, there was something else — an energy that made the whole room feel a little warmer.

“Dani Maye?” he said, smiling.

“Ryan,” I replied, and suddenly the nerves faded.

The first few minutes were a blur of awkward laughter and shy smiles. But then, just like online, the conversation flowed. He told me about the time he got lost trying to photograph a sunrise and ended up in a cow pasture. I told him about my failed attempt at making sourdough during lockdown. We laughed, and it felt easy — like two people catching up after years apart, not meeting for the first time.

At one point, he looked at me and said, “You know, you smile the same way you text.”

I tilted my head. “Is that a compliment?”

He grinned. “Absolutely.”

We stayed until the café closed, walking out under the glow of streetlights. The night was cool and still, the kind of evening that made you forget about time. He walked me to my car, hands in his pockets, a little hesitant.

“I’m really glad you decided to reply,” he said.

“Me too,” I answered softly.

We stood there for a moment, smiling at each other, both unsure how to say goodnight. Finally, he said, “So… I’ll message you tomorrow?”

I laughed. “You’d better.”

And as I drove home, my phone buzzed. A text.

“You’re even prettier when you laugh.”

I stared at it for a long moment, smiling to myself. Maybe online dating wasn’t always a disaster. Maybe sometimes, between all the faces and empty messages, you found something real.

* **Radiation / Thermal / Power Challenges Unique to Space**

# 🪐 PHASE 2: MULTI-PLANET LOGISTICS

Imagine **three or four full planets**, each with **unique biome physics and factory constraints**, for example:

|Planet Type|Core Challenge|Resource Advantage|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Europa-style Ice World|Extreme cooling, slippery terrain|Infinite geothermal cooling loops|
|Volcanic Planet|Constant overheating risk|Insane power potential|
|Gas Giant High-Altitude Platforms|Stability and wind resistance|Floating platforms & air-based mining|
|Mars-like Rocky World|Low atmosphere, solar variance|Rare high-efficiency ores|

You’re no longer just building **factories** — you’re designing **interplanetary supply networks.**

# 🚀 PHASE 3: STARSHIPS AS MOBILE FACTORIES

* **Build-able & Modular Ships** — Like trains... but in space.
* **Docking Clamps / Orbital Stations** — Deliver cargo between planets in real-time.
* **Fuel Optimization / Trajectory-Based Delivery** — Your logistic brain just got a promotion.

# 👩‍🔬 PHASE 4: LORE & PURPOSE (OPTIONAL BUT POWERFUL)

We don’t need a campaign.  
But **one simple narrative hook** would give *meaning* to expansion:

Introduce **AI rival factories**, *visible from orbit,* expanding like a **creeping infection.**  
No need for combat — **just pressure.** Beat them through better engineering.

# WHY THIS MATTERS

Satisfactory isn’t just a building game — it’s **a story of industrial domination.**

But that night, something clicked. The world was silent, my phone wasn’t buzzing, and for once, my mind felt… clear. I got lost in my thoughts, wrote for hours, and even made peace with my half-empty coffee cup.

All-nighters get a bad rep (and rightfully so if you do them often), but that night taught me something deeper - **focus is easier when the world is quiet.**

Since then, I’ve tried to recreate that peace *without* staying up all night. I light a candle, play lo-fi beats, and set boundaries with distractions.

The goal isn’t to chase exhaustion - it’s to find flow.  
So yeah, one all-nighter might have ruined my sleep schedule… but it also reminded me that silence can be magical",1,1760774480.0,GeniusLab,0,1.0,False

Maybe no one ever does.,"So I’m sitting in a coffee shop right now. There’s this low hum of people talking, cups clinking, the smell of espresso hanging in the air. It should feel comforting, but it doesn’t. I’m just here because I didn’t know where else to go. I didn’t want to stay in my room again, lying in bed staring at the ceiling, feeling everything pressing down on me until it hurts to breathe.

There’s some kind of hollow solace in being able to stand up after breaking down. It doesn’t feel like strength. It feels like survival on instinct. My body moves, my face looks normal, but everything inside feels detached and lifeless.

I like being alone sometimes, but right now, it feels like a punishment. I keep wishing someone had checked on me. I wish someone cared enough to notice that I’m fading. My phone stays silent. The world keeps turning. People laugh, talk, and move on with their lives while I sit here trying to remember how to feel alive.

Am I okay? No. Not even close. My thoughts keep circling around things I don’t want to think about. I try to push them away, but they find their way back, whispering that maybe it would be easier if I just stopped trying. I hate that thought, but it feels louder every day.

I’ve cried more than I want to admit. Every tear feels like it should wash something away, but it doesn’t. It just leaves me emptier, like I’m hollowing out from the inside. There’s no relief, just exhaustion. I’m tired of holding on.

I feel powerless. I feel like nothing I do matters. I feel like I’ve failed in every way that counts. I keep pretending I’m fine because I don’t know how to say I’m not. I want to ask for help, but I don’t even know what help looks like anymore. I keep telling myself someone might care, but it’s hard to believe when the silence keeps proving otherwise.

I sit here surrounded by people, yet I have never felt this alone. Every sound around me feels distant, every movement feels pointless. It’s like the world exists in color, and I’m stuck watching it in black and white.

I’m tired of surviving. I’m tired of waking up and pretending another day will change something. I’m tired of being the only one who sees the cracks.

Maybe no one will notice. Maybe no one ever does.

So I’ll just sit here a little longer, sip my coffee, and stare out the window until the cup is empty, like me.",2,1760773981.0,RantAndVentPH,0,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Makes me a bit sick to know I own this many but I’m also glad it’s now down to less than 100. I used to own somewhere around 130 not that long ago. This year I went on a no-buy on wallflowers and started working on using up my stash. About half of them were purchased during winter SAS at 75% off. The only one I acquired after I started my no-buy was the Sweetest Song and that’s only because it came in the Mother’s Day gift bag from this year and my mother doesn’t use home fragrances. So I kept the wallflower, the diffuser and the candle. I finish about 2 per month. So my current stash could take me almost 4 years to use up. I’ve been very diligent on using these every month. I don’t plan on donating any since it’s not really something that I’m just desperately trying to get rid of and they don’t take up much space. They all fit in a medium sized BBW bag that’s stored in my closet. 

Also, if you noticed some of these might be old discontinued scents. Almost 2 years ago while moving to my current apartment, I found a makeup bag full of wallflowers that was hidden in a small suitcase in a closet. I forgot all about them mostly because the diffuser I was using broke in like 2020 and that was also around the time I stopped shopping at BBW for about 4 years. I did use some of them this year and the scents are still good. Especially the Chocolate Lava Cake ones which I had several. ",2,1760773359.0,bathandbodyworks,0,1.0,False

Hey there, coffee lover!  
If you’ve just bought your first espresso machine or plan to get one soon, you might be wondering — *how do I use it the right way?* Don’t worry. I’ll walk you through it step by step.

Making espresso at home isn’t as hard as it seems. Once you understand how the machine works and follow a few simple tricks, you’ll make rich, creamy espresso like a pro.

In this guide, I’ll show you:

* How an espresso machine works (in simple terms)
* Step-by-step guide to brewing espresso
* Common mistakes and how to fix them
* Expert tips and my personal experience

Let’s begin your espresso journey.

#  Understanding Your Espresso Machine (Simple Breakdown)

Before you make espresso, you need to know your machine. Don’t worry; I’ll explain it in simple words.

# 🧩 1.1 The Main Parts of an Espresso Machine

Most espresso machines have these basic parts:

* **Water tank:** holds the water.
* **Portafilter:** the handle that holds the coffee grounds.
* **Group head:** where water comes out into the portafilter.
* **Steam wand:** makes milk foam for cappuccinos or lattes.
* **Drip tray:** catches spills.
* **Control buttons or knobs:** start or stop the brewing.

📊 *Interesting Fact:*  
According to *Home Grounds (2024)*, over **70% of espresso beginners** struggle at first because they don’t understand the machine parts. Once they learn them, their espresso quality improves by **80%**!

# ⚙️ 1.2 How the Machine Works

It’s simple.  
You add water to the tank. The machine heats the water until it’s very hot (around 90–96°C). Then, it pushes the water through tightly packed coffee grounds at high pressure. This process takes only about 25–30 seconds and creates the dark, strong shot we call **espresso**.

💬 *Expert Tip:*  
Barista trainer **James Hoffmann** says, “The magic of espresso lies in pressure and timing. Too much or too little of either, and your coffee changes completely.”

# Step-by-Step Guide to Making Espresso

Now that you know your machine, let’s brew!

# 🧴 2.1 Step 1: Prepare Your Machine

Start by cleaning everything. Make sure your portafilter and cup are dry and clean.  
Fill the water tank with **fresh, filtered water** — not tap water if possible.  
Turn on your machine and let it heat up for about **15–20 minutes**. This makes sure the water is hot enough to extract flavor.

🧠 *Pro Tip:*  
Preheating your machine helps create **even extraction**, which means a smoother and richer espresso.

# ☕ 2.2 Step 2: Grind Your Coffee Beans

Use **freshly roasted beans**.  
Grind them fine — almost like table salt.  
If the grind is too coarse, your espresso will taste weak.  
If it’s too fine, the water won’t flow properly.

Use about **18–20 grams** of ground coffee for a double shot.

📊 *Fun Stat:*  
According to *Perfect Daily Grind (2023)*, **87% of baristas** agree that using fresh beans and the right grind size is the key to perfect espresso.

# ⚖️ 2.3 Step 3: Tamp the Coffee

Now take your portafilter and fill it with ground coffee.  
Use a **tamper** to press it down firmly and evenly. Don’t press too soft or too hard.  
You just want the surface flat and smooth.

💬 *Barista Tip:*  
I always press once firmly and then twist a little at the end to smooth the top. That helps the water flow evenly.

# 💧 2.4 Step 4: Start Brewing

Attach the portafilter to the machine and lock it in place.  
Put your espresso cup under the spout.  
Press the brew button and let it run for **25–30 seconds**.

You’ll see the espresso flow slowly and form a golden layer on top — that’s the **crema**, the heart of espresso flavor.

If it flows too fast, your grind is too coarse.  
If it’s too slow, your grind is too fine.

# 🥛 2.5 Step 5: Steam Your Milk (Optional)

If you love cappuccino or latte, use the **steam wand**.  
Pour cold milk into a jug.  
Dip the wand just below the milk surface and turn it on.  
Move the jug slowly until the milk gets hot and foamy.

💬 *User Experience:*  
When I first tried steaming milk, I made a mess! But after a few tries, I learned to keep the wand just below the surface. It made creamy foam every time.

📊 *Stat:*  
Surveys show **6 out of 10 coffee lovers** enjoy milk-based espresso drinks daily.

# ☕ 2.6 Step 6: Serve and Enjoy

Pour your espresso into a cup, add milk if you like, and sip it fresh.  
That’s it — you made real espresso!

👏 *Congratulations!*  
You just did what many people think is hard.

# Common Mistakes & How to Fix Them

Even with practice, small mistakes can happen. Let’s fix them.

# ⚠️ 3.1 Bitter Taste

**Cause:** Over-extraction — brewing too long or grind too fine.  
**Fix:** Grind a little coarser or shorten the brew time.

# ⚠️ 3.2 Weak or Watery Espresso

**Cause:** Under-extraction — grind too coarse or not enough coffee.  
**Fix:** Use more grounds or grind finer.

# ⚠️ 3.3 No Crema

**Cause:** Old beans or low pressure.  
**Fix:** Use fresh beans and check your machine pressure (should be around 9 bars).

# ⚠️ 3.4 Uneven Taste

**Cause:** Uneven tamping or uneven grind.  
**Fix:** Press coffee evenly and clean the portafilter after each use.

💬 *Expert Opinion:*  
Barista instructor **Megan Wilson** says, “Most espresso problems come from bad tamping or wrong grind size. Fix those, and 90% of your problems go away.”

#  Pro Tips, Expert Advice & User Stories

This is where I share what I’ve learned — and what other coffee lovers say too.

# 💡 4.1 My Personal Routine

Every morning, I:

1. Clean my espresso machine.
2. Grind fresh beans.
3. Warm up my cup.
4. Brew a 25-second shot.
5. Add a little steamed milk.

That’s my daily ritual. Simple and perfect.

# 📈 4.2 Expert Advice

According to *Coffee Science Foundation*, maintaining your espresso machine properly can **extend its life by up to 5 years**.  
Clean your portafilter daily and descale the machine monthly.

Barista champion **Matt Perger** says:

# 👥 4.3 User Experiences

* **Sarah from Texas:** “When I first got my espresso machine, my coffee was watery. Then I learned to tamp properly — now it’s rich and creamy!”
* **Ali from Dubai:** “I used to buy coffee daily. After learning to use my machine, I save $150 a month and make café-quality coffee at home.”
* **Lina from Canada:** “Steaming milk scared me, but now I love making latte art!”

The problem is that the German post office just keeps sending back letters saying that they ""where not up to the regulations for the shipping format.""

It just sucks  because i like to think that a am helping people find some cards they need and i my self am always happy if i find a seller that has like 5 random commons that i need.

I’ve also changed a lot of other things in my lifestyle and diet so not sure what is causing what.

3 weeks ago i got a mild cold. Hadn’t been sick for 8-9months so I was expecting this mild cold. I went to the gym even tho i felt a little crappy which was NOT a good idea. I got better on saturday but then monday 2 weeks ago i started getting really bad headaches lasted 2 days tho. But they were bad. I just pushed through and went to the gym. Bad idea. I just couldn’t live with the fact that i dont get my steps excetera. I also felt a lymphnode was swollen beside my chin. But I didn’t think more about it.

Headache got better and I just thought its probably just before my period bc my period was starting on friday. Okay thursday I went out for a coffee with friends. I took some painkillers bc I felt that my period was coming. While being there I WAS SWEATING MY ASS OFF. I was really really struggling. And It just felt weird. This sweating didnt feel normal. It was tough. Later that night I got home and started feeling something in my throat. Looked in my throat and saw a liittle swollen tonsilles. I was just like GREAT WHAT IS IT NOW. Friday. Throat got worse got white coating. Throughout the day my throat just got worse and worse. And also MY PERIOD STARTED. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW I FELT. The next night couldn’t sleep. We have a doctor in our family so I talked to him and he said you can try antibiotics it looks bacterial bc i didnt have any other symptoms. 

Started the antibiotics, 4 days in and my throat got bad. I couldn’t even almost swallow my own saliva. And this is were mentally i started getting really bad anxiety. I was just thinking of my muscles they go away, im not eating im not this and that. Went to the doctor next day just to get blood tests and see wth was really going on. He just said based on the circumstances when antibiotics aren’t working i think you have MONO. I couldnt believe it. I knew if I have mono theres no working out for a long time. Got my blood tests taken 
crp:7 so nothing crazy
and all my blood levels didnt show any crazy things so my body was handling it well. But mentally i wasn’t. I started crying when I got home and probably people who haven’t had mono its really hard to understand how harsh it can be mentally too. 

So currently just thanking my body and appreciating it more than ever. Im happy I could switch my mindset a little and look at the bright side. Ur health is more important than some muscles u can rebuild. So mono really taught me patience and selflove. Its so so important. Rn been in my bed for 2 weeks im starting to feel better thankgod. Haven’t been extra tired either. So for everyone else struggling mentally. I see you..

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free “beans”** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

———————————-

**Steps:**
* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link (**[here](https://app.costa.co.uk/PsbT/t3v6u7lz)**).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **K9GUN**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the “free” 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it’s anything like Caffè Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Enjoy the free cake I recommend the Mini Cherry Bakewell!

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I have a lot of questions and would really appreciate your input:
	•	What are the most important things I should think about before investing my money?
	•	What are the most common problems or mistakes that new café owners face?
	•	How can I plan and track my finances (like expenses, profits, and break-even point)?
	•	How can I calculate and understand all my costs and what tools should I use?

I’ve left it completely in my heart and made peace with that. But now I find myself in a weird limbo where people family and friends still think I’m in the church and judge me for drinking coffee and dressing immodestly/not wearing garments. It feels like they are sensing my disbelief and actually hoping to ostracize me for not being “one of them”. 

When they changed the garments, it was so funny that oh, all of a sudden you can’t judge others for showing off your shoulders anymore! The old ladies seemed especially disappointed in this one! It’s ironic the church claims to propagate Jesus teachings…and Jesus preached not to judge others, right?

The only reason I haven’t owned up to it and came right out to tell everyone I’ve left it, is because I don’t want to hurt my parents..seeing their reaction to my brother leaving was BAD. Not that they disowned him, but that I watched how it literally broke their hearts when he left. We are both grown adults not living at home. And ever since he left I have felt more pressure from them, for me to be “perfect” for me to be, and I quote, “at least one child that they can be proud of” 😭 

My parents def know something is up they just don’t know how far long gone I am. Do I just coast and kind of let them hold on to hope? I am silently suffering to be honest:( every time the church comes up, I get extremely triggered.

Btw!!!! Is it not creepy, everyone looking and analyzing me constantly to see if I’m wearing the right underwear?!? OMG I feel objectified. 
I am just wearing shorter and shorter skirts and that seems to be getting the message through.

And what is the thing with chopping garmys into pieces before throwing them away? Cause yeah, I didn’t do that. It was really liberating just throwing them in the trash. Felt like a bad breakup!

I am helped by a nutritionnist I see every 2 weeks. Last weighing I came at 125kg (for 1m83).

At this point this is everything I do to lose weight :

- my breakfast consists in only a coffee with a spring of milk, nothing more.
- I weight the quantity of carbs and meat I eat.
- I eat a lot of vegetables and very few fatry products
- I only eat meals me or my wife prepared. Nothing industrialized, and the vegetables we eat come from an organic farm 40km away.
- I almost never eat (or drink)  sugar. Like my daily intake consists of a tablespoon of honey in my yoghurt. I don't drink sodas (never have tbh) either.
- I don't eat between meals.

As for physical exercise, I walk everywhere. I swim 2 times a week for 1 km. I do Karate 2 times a week and Iaido 2 times a week too. All encompassing (without the walking which is harder to quantify) that's 8 hours of sport a week.

Guess what. Last week my nutritionnist make me do an impedance measuring. I gained fat and lost muscles...

Now here is the weird part. Last week I got a wisdom tooth removed, and for 1 week I have been on a strict liquid diet. That means soup. Just soup. And a yoghurt. For 1 week.

I weighed myself this morning, I am now 126kg, so I went up 1 kilo.

At this point I can't help but laugh at how hard my body just seems to want to not lose fat...",1,1760771422.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

Kontekst

👊🏻 Antifa to ruch, który wyrósł z anarchistycznych i punkowych środowisk lat 90., broniących się przed skinheadami i neonazistami.

❓ Podczas demonstracji w Warszawie Kolorowa Niepodległa 2011 policja otoczyła siedzibę Krytyki Politycznej, gdzie ukryli się niemieccy antyfaszyści. Do dziś krążą mity na temat tego, skąd się tam wzięli i co robili.

🚓 Antifa, luźna i niehierarchiczna wspólnota, jest dziś demonizowana i wykorzystywana przez prawicę do straszenia i uzasadniania represji.

Miałem 13 lat i jak co niedzielę szedłem z mamą i bratem do kościoła. Ulica nazywała się Spokojna, co dobrze oddawało klimat okolicy, ale tego dnia zwyczajową beztroskę rodzinnego spaceru przerwał wrzask dobiegający od strony ulicy Ewangelickiej. Mama zatrzymała nas i cofnęliśmy się kilka metrów. Słychać było śpiew męskich gardeł, a po chwili zza zakrętu wyłoniła się tyraliera skinheadów i kiboli połączonych sił Motoru Lublin i Śląska Wrocław. Jako 13-latek dobrze już wiedziałem, kto jest kim w świecie subkultur i ulicznej bandyterki, a skini uchodzili za bezwzględnych brutali, których należało się wystrzegać. Większość moich starszych kolegów to byli metale i punki, zwani przez neonazistów brudasami. Potyczki brudasów i skinów to był w Lublinie chleb powszedni. Krążyły też opowieści o prawdziwych bitwach rozgrywanych na przedmieściach. Dzisiaj nazwalibyśmy je ustawkami.

Staliśmy przed schodkami prowadzącymi na charakterystyczny nasyp, na którym ulokowane były trzy zabytkowe, acz zaniedbane wille oraz dawna niemiecka strzelnica z czasów wojny. Na nasypie pojawiła się osoba, która dostrzegłszy zbliżający się tumult, sprintem ruszyła w kierunku willi, w której mieściła się herbaciarnia Zielony Imbryk. W budynku tym odbywały się cyklicznie punkowe giełdy, gdzie można było kupić kasety i płyty z muzyką, koszulki, ćwieki, kolczyki, naszywki. Giełda była też okazją do spotkania młodzieży anarchistycznej, a willa jeszcze długo służyła jako namiastka późniejszego skłotu Tektura.

Neonazistowscy chuligani ryknęli i ruszyli biegiem w tamtym kierunku, wspinając się na skarpę i rzucając na siedzących przed wejściem ludzi. Od strony Krakowskiego Przedmieścia zawyła syrena policyjna, a ze skłotu słychać było wrzaski. Nie dało się obejść sytuacji, więc patrzyliśmy, jak skini zaczynają się wycofywać, osaczeni przez policję z jednej i kontratakujących anarchistycznych bojówkarzy z drugiej strony. Poleciały za nimi butelki, cegły i deski, a wobec nadciągających sił policyjnych wszyscy rozbiegli się w swoje strony, bo policja nie dba o rozróżnienie, kto zaczął.

Któryś z napastników porzucił za sobą czerwony kij bejsbolowy z nasmarowanym korektorem krzyżem celtyckim. Zauważyłem go, schowałem pod drzewem na pobliskim cmentarzu ewangelickim i ku przerażeniu mamy zgarnąłem w drodze powrotnej do domu. Miałem go jeszcze wiele lat, dopóki gdzieś nie zaginął, pożyczony koledze jako rekwizyt do szkolnego teatru.

Bojówkarze, którzy odparli wówczas atak skinheadów, to protoplaści tego, co dzisiaj nazywa się Antifą. Także dziś są to młodzi, sprawni fizycznie, odważni członkowie i członkinie ruchu anarchistycznego, którzy deklarują zdolność oraz wolę fizycznego ochraniania punkowych koncertów, skłotów i demonstracji. Nie prowadzą rejestru członków, nie wydają legitymacji ani nie pobierają składek. Nie ma tam nawet mowy o przynależności, bo udział w ruchu może być utajony, epizodyczny lub akcydentalny, jako że anarchistyczna młodzież często się przemieszcza. Wszystko opiera się o relacje towarzyskie oraz zobowiązania względem solidarnej społeczności.

Społeczność ta jest jak na 40-milionowy kraj maleńka i rozproszona, zwłaszcza w porównaniu z odpowiednikami w Niemczech, Francji, Hiszpanii czy Włoszech. Opisane przeze mnie starcie było z okresu schyłkowego subkultur lat dziewięćdziesiątych. Skini i punki to dzisiaj folklor. Faszyzm się znormalizował i rozpłynął pośród garniturków Młodzieży Wszechpolskiej czy Ordo Iuris, rekonstruktorskich mundurów, sutann, dresów kiboli i normikowych dżinsów konfiarzy. A punk zmarł na marskość wątroby.

Polski anarchizm nie jest propozycją polityczną, tylko stylem życia, mikrokulturą. To młodzi ludzie, którzy szukają dla siebie marginesu wolności w pejzażu dużych miast i systemu ustrojowego całej Europy. Jest w tym jakiś heroizm radykalnego, bezkompromisowego odcinania się od zjawisk zidentyfikowanych jako zagrożenie dla indywidualnej wolności. Obsesyjny indywidualizm współczesnych anarchistów paraliżuje rozwój ich idei, bo ogrom energii muszą wkładać w najprostsze kwestie dotyczące współżycia, jak choćby mieszkanie pod jednym dachem czy na jednym kawałku ziemi.

# Black Bloc i Kolorowa Niepodległa

W latach dwutysięcznych Europa i świat poznały lewicową młodzież z ruchu alterglobalistycznego lepiej, niż by chciały. Wszystkie najistotniejsze szczyty kapitalistycznych instytucji – Banku Światowego, Światowej Organizacji Handlu, Forum Ekonomicznego, Międzynarodowego Funduszu Walutowego i przywódców G8, od Seattle przez Waszyngton, Davos, Pragę, Genuę, aż po Melbourne, uświetniane były potężnymi zamieszkami. Płonęły samochody, wybijano witryny ekskluzywnych sklepów i banków, przeprowadzano skoordynowane ataki na stojącą na straży kapitału policję.

Wszystko to za sprawą organizmu zwanego Czarnym Blokiem. Jest to taktyka opracowana na przełomie lat siedemdziesiątych i osiemdziesiątych przez niemieckich lewaków, biorących udział w demonstracjach antyrządowych i antysystemowych. Wobec istotnej przewagi sił policyjnych i idących za tym represji prawnych, uczestnicy manifestacji ubierali się w jednolicie czarne stroje i maski, po czym szli ulicami ściśnięci blisko siebie, by stanowić trudną do rozbicia formację. Uniemożliwiało to również późniejszą identyfikację na podstawie zdjęć czy materiałów wideo. Idący w bloku demonstranci przewyższali policję mobilnością, a dołożywszy do tego odrobinę pomyślunku i koordynacji, ośmieszali funkcjonariuszy i zostawiali za sobą szlak zniszczenia w centrach bogatych miast.

Zwieńczeniem dekady antykapitalistycznego oburzenia były [zamieszki w Rzymie w 2011 roku](https://www.gazetaprawna.pl/wiadomosci/artykuly/557983,szef-wloskiego-msw-zamieszki-oburzonych-w-rzymie-to-byl-terroryzm-miejski.html). Europejscy anarchiści zastawili tam taktyczne pułapki na oddziały włoskiej policji i sparaliżowali miasto. Upokorzenie sił porządkowych było tak dotkliwe, że władze Rzymu zawiesiły demokratyczne prawo do protestu, a przeciwko zadymiarzom uruchomiono retorykę antyterrorystyczną. Niezbyt skutecznie, bo sprawców schwytano zaledwie kilkunastu.

To, co dzisiaj nazywamy Antifą, to połączenie schedy po punkach z tym, co zostało z alterglobalistycznych wystąpień ruchu Oburzonych. Z jednej strony będzie to więc wsobna mikroformacja ochraniająca skłoty przed neonazistami, a z drugiej – dziesiątki samoorganizujących się, antykapitalistycznych ruchów protestu, których celem jest konfrontacja z policją lub którąś z publicznych odsłon skrajnej prawicy.

Mniej więcej w tym samym czasie, gdy palono Rzym, Antifa zawitała również pod polskie strzechy. Tutaj znowu historia osobista. 11 listopada 2011 roku w centrum Warszawy odbywały się dwie duże demonstracje z okazji Święta Niepodległości: organizowany przez nacjonalistów Marsz Niepodległości oraz Kolorowa Niepodległa, zwołana przez koalicję środowisk lewicowych. Jako fotograf dokumentowałem ówczesne wydarzenia z ramienia Krytyki Politycznej, która wzięła na siebie rolę liderki strony postępowej.

Niedługo po rozstawieniu sceny na ulicy Marszałkowskiej któraś z koleżanek powiedziała mi, że coś się stało w siedzibie KP, Nowym Wspaniałym Świecie, i policja obstawiła budynek. Pobiegłem to sprawdzić – nie tylko budynek, ale cały odcinek ulicy Nowy Świat zamknięty został przez zamaskowanych funkcjonariuszy w kaskach. Z zewnątrz nie sposób było się domyślić, co się tam dzieje. Koledzy machali mi z okien i krzyczeli, że nikt nie może wyjść ani wejść do lokalu. Ktoś rozmawiał przez telefon z ludźmi wewnątrz, którzy też nie byli w stanie wyjaśnić więcej niż to, że przy wejściu policja stłoczyła kilkadziesiąt osób i jest szarpanina.

Reszty musieliśmy się stopniowo dowiadywać z serwisów internetowych – i były to same niespodzianki. Oto według narracji największych stacji telewizyjnych w siedzibie Krytyki Politycznej zatrzymano grupę kilkudziesięciu agresywnych bojówkarzy z Niemiec, którzy zamierzali stanąć naprzeciw Marszu Niepodległości uzbrojeni w kastety, gaz pieprzowy i inne niebezpieczne przedmioty odnalezione w lokalu.

W Krytyce Politycznej pracowaliśmy kolektywnie, wspólnie podejmując decyzje i opowiadając sobie swoją pracę, a w NWŚ byłem do późnych godzin jeszcze dzień wcześniej i nie widziałem tam ani Niemców, ani żadnej ze wspomnianych broni. Nikt nie wspominał, że jacyś bojówkarze mają nas zamiar odwiedzić.

Odwiedzili jednak na zaproszenie którejś z mniejszych organizacji wchodzących w skład koalicji. Rok wcześniej niemieckim lewakom i lewaczkom wespół z mieszkańcami Drezna udało się skutecznie zablokować ogromny nazistowski marsz, który regularnie zawłaszczał sobie ulice tego miasta. Był to ogromny sukces i ktoś wpadł na pomysł, że Kolorowej Niepodległej przyda się wsparcie przyjaciół z zachodu.

Antyfaszyści wyznaczyli sobie miejsce zbiórki na rogu Świętokrzyskiej i Nowego Światu, po czym ruszyli na Marszałkowską, ale nie zaszli daleko, bo wdali się w awanturę z jakimś prawackim rekonstruktorem. Zaskakująco szybko pojawiła się policja w sile kilku radiowozów i pognała antyfaszystów z powrotem w stronę Świętokrzyskiej, gdzie zostali wzięci w dwa ognie i zmuszeni do schronienia się w NWŚ, gdzie w pośpiechu opróżnili kieszenie, próbując chować się, gdzie popadnie. Lokal okrążono, Niemców zatrzymano.

W przeciągu kilku kolejnych godzin aż do wieczora uczestnicy Marszu Niepodległości – kibole, naziole, narodowcy, rekonstruktorzy i rodziny z dziećmi – pustoszyli okolice placu Konstytucji. Biegałem za nimi z aparatem, dokumentując demolowane radiowozy, zrywany bruk, tłuczone szyby wiat przystankowych, napadanych przechodniów, przemoc policji oraz podpalony wóz transmisyjny stacji TVN. Żądne zadymy bandy nacjonalistów polowały na lewactwo w całym Śródmieściu na długo po tym, gdy zakończyła się Kolorowa Niepodległa.

Gdy próbowaliśmy z zespołem Krytyki Politycznej wydostać się z Marszałkowskiej, jakaś uprzejma staruszka wskazała nas bandzie kiboli, którzy ruszyli na nas z wrzaskiem. Biegliśmy w stronę zaparkowanych nieopodal wozów policyjnych, ale na ten widok pozostawieni do opieki nad nimi funkcjonariusze pozamykali się w szoferkach. Nie było Antify, żeby nas ochronić i krucho by z nami było, gdyby nie życzliwi pracownicy Costa Coffee, gdzie wpadliśmy zziajani. O tym, jak wiele ryzykowali, dowiedzieliśmy się w ciągu kolejnych paru dni, gdy liberalne media odpowiedzialnością za zamieszki w stolicy uparcie próbowały obciążyć właśnie Krytykę Polityczną.

„Nie pierdol się, tylko pytaj od razu, dlaczego zaprosili Niemców” – podpowiadał znany dziennikarz dużej rozgłośni radiowej swojej koleżance po fachu. Stałem za nimi na sali pełnej mediów, gdzie za chwilę miała zacząć się konferencja prasowa zorganizowana przez Krytykę Polityczną, mająca przedstawić naszą perspektywę tych zajść.  

Setki tysięcy złotych strat, zastraszone społeczeństwo, ranni i aresztowani – to był bezpośredni efekt nacjonalistycznej rozróby, ale media głównego nurtu oraz topowi politycy winy upatrywali w prowokacyjnej obecności Antify, zaproszonej ich zdaniem przez lewicową organizację pozarządową. Antify, która nawet nie zbliżyła się do którejkolwiek z dwóch manifestacji. Krytyka Polityczna dała merytoryczny odpór tej nagonce, ale kosztowało nas to dużo energii i zdrowia oraz nie uchroniło przed przykrymi konsekwencjami w kolejnych latach działalności. Dziś media głównego nurtu ochoczo zapraszają naszych komentatorów i pytają, kto zalegitymizował w Polsce skrajną prawicę.

# Anti-antifa Donalda Trumpa

W 2020 roku przez Stany Zjednoczone przetoczyła się fala protestów przeciwko rasizmowi i policyjnej przemocy, związana z zabójstwem George’a Floyda. Ówczesny prokurator generalny William Barr [stwierdził, że tam, gdzie dochodziło do zamieszek, demonstranci używali taktyki w stylu Antify](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-says-he-will-designate-antifa-terrorist-organization-gop-points-n1220321). Śpiewkę podchwycił prezydent Donald Trump, a za nim jego świta oraz sprzyjające mu media. Trump już wówczas zapowiedział zakwalifikowanie Antify jako grupy terrorystycznej, ale szybko okazało się, że nie ma do tego narzędzi prawnych.

Podczas swojej drugiej kadencji republikański prezydent poczyna sobie znacznie śmielej niż poprzednio i [22 września 2025 opublikował rozporządzenie](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/) określające Antifę „wewnętrzną organizacją terrorystyczną” i przypisując jej szereg zarzutów, które można sprowadzić do tego, że Antifa aktywnie działa na rzecz obalenia rządu USA.

Według Trumpa jest to bezpośrednia reakcja na zabójstwo youtubera [Charliego Kirka](https://krytykapolityczna.pl/swiat/prawica-ciemne-oswiecenie-i-komunizm-wojny-zizek/), ale to oczywiste kłamstwo. Nie ma żadnych przesłanek, by wiązać aresztowanego zamachowca z ruchem anarchistycznym. Trump chce uderzyć w demonstrantów oraz aktywistów uniemożliwiających pracę agentom ICE, amerykańskiego Urzędu Celno-Imigracyjnego. W najważniejszych miastach Stanów Zjednoczonych ludzie skrzykują się i ostrzegają migrantów przed patrolami ICE, blokują bramy ich posterunków oraz organizują pikiety. Swoim rozporządzeniem Trump klasyfikuje te działania jako aktywność antypaństwową i próbuje zastraszyć obywateli.

Ale dzieje się coś jeszcze. Wciągając demonstrantów pod mianownik Antify, Trump próbuje odebrać im walor społeczny. Pomimo powszechności oporu, wyrażający go stają się członkami organizacji tajemnej i niszowej, a zarazem wrogiem łatwym do sklasyfikowania i ogarnięcia rozumem, zwłaszcza rozumem miłośników teorii spiskowych.

Co więcej, po prawej stronie działa kilka fanatycznych organizacji, które faktycznie mają strukturę, hierarchię, liderów, ideologię i broń. Najlepiej dali się poznać Proud Boys, którzy „ochraniali” szturmujących Kapitol 6 stycznia 2021 roku. Po zamieszkach aresztowano i skazano pięciu liderów organizacji. W procesach okazało się, że razem z Oath Keepers i wyznawcami QAnon sprawnie pokierowali oni atakiem, mieli go w planie i gdyby nie zostali powstrzymani, obaliliby legalny rząd USA.

Trump ułaskawił organizatorów szturmu i potrzebuje symetrycznej organizacji po lewej stronie, bo taka asymetria wygląda brzydko nawet jak na wątpliwe standardy obecnej administracji.

# Ochraniajcie kościoły

27 października 2020 roku prezes PiS Jarosław Kaczyński wezwał swoich stronników do obrony kościołów przed uczestniczkami Strajków Kobiet. Stwierdził, że demonstracje odbywające się w całej Polsce wydają się być zorganizowane, nihilistyczne i wulgarne.

Kibole, faszyści i inni nacjonalistyczni awanturnicy potraktowali to jako przyzwolenie na przemoc. Był tylko jeden problem. W demonstracjach przeciwko zaostrzaniu prawa do aborcji brały udział głównie dziewczyny, ewentualnie ich partnerzy, dzieci i koledzy. Dziewczyn się nie bije, jak głosi nasze narodowe, przedszkolne hasło, więc prawaccy bojówkarze mieli nie lada zagwozdkę. Niektórym to nie przeszkadzało i [w zgodzie z dyspensą Kaczyńskiego atakowali kobiety](https://wroclaw.wyborcza.pl/wroclaw/7,35771,26456652,kibol-ktory-zaatakowal-dziennikarke-wyborczej-na-strajku.html).

Pozostali szukali na ulicach Antify.

Strajki Kobiet dokumentowałem i [relacjonowałem obszernie](https://krytykapolityczna.pl/kraj/wasze-kaplice-nasze-macice-zdjecia). Wzdłuż tras przemarszów grasowały kilkunasto-, kilkudziesięcioosobowe bandy zamaskowanych typów, biegając od bramy do bramy w wielkim podnieceniu. Gdziekolwiek spostrzegli inną grupkę ludzi lub wydawało im się, że ktoś coś do nich krzyknął lub im się przygląda, gnali szukając bitki, bez większych rezultatów. Po prostu brakowało przeciwnika. Towarzyszyła temu desperacja i rozczarowanie. Tak wykształciła się Anti-Antifa. Jest to bzdura, ale na murach do dzisiaj pojawiają się namazane spayem hasła tego ruchu, a [w sklepach można kupić taki merch](https://narodowy-sklep.pl/produkt/koszulka-anti-antifa/).

Polska prawica pręży się i nadyma, a nie ma się z kim bić. Sprawa jest żałosna, ale też bardzo niebezpieczna. Ten, kto wskaże rzeszom narodowców kogoś do bicia, zdobędzie ich serca, umysły i pięści – kosztem bogu ducha winnych ofiar ulicznych napaści. Najlepiej jakby poszli do wojska, ale nie miejmy złudzeń. Ich wrzaski to nie jest patriotyzm rozumiany jako powinność wobec państwa, tylko bandytyzm. Tym ludziom nie potrzeba generała, a wysoko postawionego eksperta od ustawek. Znamy kogoś takiego?

Trumpizm promieniuje na Europę i również [premier Węgier Wiktor Orbán ogłosił, że Antifa jest organizacją terrorystyczną](https://www.pap.pl/aktualnosci/wegry-orban-rzad-uznal-antife-za-organizacje-terrorystyczna) i będzie w jego kraju ścigana. Orban od lat łasi się do Trumpa, ale gest ten pozostaje pusty do momentu, gdy na Węgrzech czy w jakimkolwiek innym kraju, który pójdzie tym śladem, nie zacznie się jakieś prodemokratyczne wzmożenie.

Ponieważ Antifa jako organizacja nie istnieje, opinia publiczna nie ma pojęcia, o kim mowa. Można dzięki temu przypisać tę afiliację każdemu nieszczęśnikowi i oskarżyć go o bardzo poważne przestępstwo. To, że wykazanie przynależności do Antify będzie niemal niemożliwe, nie ma znaczenia. Ważne, że powszechnie stosowane również w Polsce [narzędzie SLAPP](https://siecobywatelska.pl/slapp/)u zyskuje nowy wymiar, bo nie grozi grzywną czy pracami społecznymi, ale wieloletnim więzieniem, a wcześniej – niemal pewnym aresztem.

[](https://krytykapolityczna.pl/wspieraj/)

Co więcej w Polsce, podobnie jak w USA Donalda Trumpa, istnieją organizacje, które faktycznie mogłyby wysadzić jakąś władzę z siodła, a przynajmniej solidnie nią wstrząsnąć. Organizacje, które są otwarcie antydemokratyczne, tworzą siatki, są zarządzane przez liderów, spotykają się regularnie, ćwiczą taktykę i technikę walki w środowisku miejskim oraz tworzą listy wrogów z zamiarem ich fizycznego wyeliminowania lub podporządkowania. To ONR, Straż Marszu Niepodległości, Wojownicy Maryi, niezliczone bojówki kibolskie i grupy rekonstruktorskie, pragnące żyć życiem wilka.

Prawica śni o Antifie, bo zyskuje dzięki niej nowy, ciężki paragraf oraz chce się mieć z kim bić. Lewica zaś chce wierzyć, że gdzieś w sekrecie istnieje rzutka i dziarska młodzież, która w razie czego stanie w obronie liberalnej demokracji. Jedni i drudzy narażają się na śmieszność. Gdyby Antifa przedziwnym zbiegiem okoliczności objawiła się jako siła polityczna, to z jednej strony nie nadawałaby się do inwigilacji, bo identyfikować się z ruchem kulturowym może każdy, wszędzie i niezależnie od innych. Z drugiej zaś, nawet gdyby tych młodych antyfaszystów objawiły się dziesiątki tysięcy, to wedle anarchistycznych ideałów taka Antifa miałaby w dupie klasę średnią i jej zatapiane przez Nawrockiego, Kaczyńskiego i Rydzyka państwo.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

**Thunderbird ha entregado su último envío mensual de correos con correcciones de errores.**

Los usuarios del cliente de correo electrónico de código abierto de MZLA Technologies (la compañía vio [aumentar sus ingresos anuales un 19% el año pasado](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2025/10/state-of-the-bird-2024-25/) a más de 10 millones de dólares) reciben una serie de [mejoras y ajustes](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/144.0/releasenotes/) al conjunto de características existentes del software, pero ninguna novedad importante.

Los usuarios de Fastmail (que no quieran instalar la [nueva aplicación de escritorio Fastmail](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2025/10/fastmail-desktop-app-for-linux) ) estarán encantados de saber que las contraseñas CalDAV funcionan nuevamente, lo que restaura el acceso para ver y editar los calendarios de Fastmail desde Thunderbird.

Los recordatorios de tareas a veces no aparecían en tareas sin fecha de finalización o con fechas de vencimiento modificadas. Esto se ha solucionado: ahora aparecen como se espera. Al hacer shiftclic con el botón derecho en ""Redactar mensaje para"" en un enlace de correo, ahora se abre en texto sin formato.

Thunderbird ya no se cuelga si se ejecuta una verificación automática de mensajes nuevos en varias cuentas.

Si usas una cuenta de Microsoft Exchange en Thunderbird y te molestaba que **faltara el botón ""Responder a todos""** en el editor, te alegrará saber que se ha restaurado. De igual forma, el envío de correos electrónicos a través de servidores con certificados autofirmados ya funciona.

Otros problemas que se dice que se solucionarán en la [actualización Thunderbird 144](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/144.0/releasenotes/) :

* **La ordenación por hilos solo mostró hilos con mensajes principales no leídos**
* **Los usuarios no pudieron leer correos firmados con OpenPGP v6 y claves PQC**
* **La confirmación de eliminación/desconexión de varios archivos adjuntos solo muestra el primer archivo adjunto**
* **No se puede copiar el texto de algunas alertas de error**
* **Los borradores no se guardan después de cambiar de identidad en la ventana de redacción**
* **Falta la carpeta recién creada en “Recientes” al mover un mensaje**
* Del**La clave no pudo evitar la eliminación de archivos adjuntos en los mensajes OpenPGP**
* **La vista previa de la imagen en el cuadro de diálogo** ***Insertar imagen*** **falló con el error CSP**
* **La acción 'Copiar mensaje a' en un filtro de grupo de noticias no funcionó**
* **No se puede importar el perfil ubicado en el nivel superior del archivo zip**
* **La importación del perfil desde una fuente incorrecta no indicó que falló**
* **No se puede copiar un evento en la vista de varias semanas o de mes mediante arrastrar y soltar**
* **El descubrimiento del calendario con un error de certificado mostró múltiples excepciones**

Thunderbird 144 también incluye un nuevo [lote de parches de seguridad](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2025-84/) .

Estos cubren varios errores de seguridad de memoria, un problema en el que un proceso web comprometido podría [usar mensajes IPC maliciosos](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2025-84/#CVE-2025-11710) para filtrar información entre procesos o desencadenar lecturas y escrituras fuera de límites en un proceso privilegiado que utiliza texturas WebGL manipuladas.

¿Asustado? No te preocupes demasiado. Thunderbird afirma que la mayoría de las fallas no se pueden explotar a través del correo electrónico, ya que deshabilita los scripts para leer el correo, pero los problemas podrían representar riesgos potenciales en contextos similares a los de un navegador.

# Descargar Thunderbird 144

[Descarga Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/desktop/)  para Linux, Windows y macOS desde el sitio web oficial. Las descargas  [se realizan de forma predeterminada con las compilaciones mensuales](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2025/01/thunderbird-release-channel-becomes-default-march)  (que a partir de octubre serán la 144). También puedes descargar las compilaciones ESR (versión de soporte extendido) de Thunderbird.

Actualizar a una nueva versión de Thunderbird desde una versión anterior es fácil en Windows o macOS, ya que la aplicación se actualiza automáticamente: abre *Thunderbird* , ve al  menú *Ayuda*  y selecciona  *Acerca de* . Thunderbird buscará y descargará una actualización disponible, y luego te pedirá que reinicies para aplicarla.

El mismo método funciona para la compilación binaria de Thunderbird para Linux (la que se puede descargar desde el sitio web de Thunderbird). Si usas una compilación DEB, Flatpak y Snap, la actualización se realizará mediante un administrador de paquetes, en lugar de dentro de la aplicación.",1,1760771277.0,Ubuntu_ES18011979,0,1.0,False

1o9p443,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1o9p443/fearful_avoidant_discard_brutal_and_mind_bending/,Fearful avoidant discard- brutal and mind bending.,"
I want to preface this by saying that my girlfriend was incredible, patient, loving and just utterly wonderful for the duration of our relationship.
I am a 31 year old male and she is 23.
Not that she is known to be a fearful avoidant but I suspect it’s the case?

I run and own a cafe beneath a dance studio she would regularly study dance at which is how we met. When she made her interest known, I politely declined because the age gap freaked me out, she was incredibly persistent. I did genuinely enjoy talking to her— she was very articulate, emotionally mature and we had very similar values and interests. I declined her twice.
She still came to the cafe and after much deliberation and talking with friends— they told me to not worry about the age gap and that it wouldn’t matter in the future. Aside from the age difference— she ticked a lot of boxes.

So I eventually asked her on a date and we immediately started dating. She was incredibly anxiously attached the whole relationship— and very thoughtful and communicative. I was put on the back foot a little bit as she was very quick to accelerate the relationship. Inviting me to family Christmas after 3 weeks of dating.

She lived out in the country still with her parents and would come and stay with me in the city several nights a week as that’s where she would dance and we could spend a lot of time together.

She then moved to the city and got a job. So she was studying dance from 9-2 and work at a gym 4-9 5 days a week.
This made our schedules conflict a little as I owning/ operating a cafe was up at 5am 6 days a week. But my one day off was always allocated to her. She was still my priority.

There was a time there I really hit burnout, and she was still wonderful and understanding throughout that. Constantly leaving notes and cards on my pillow saying how much she adored me and was grateful for me and thanking me for showing her what real love was (her ex was physically abusive, cheated on her and cut her off from family) 

After 3 months of her living in the city, she wrote me a text one night saying that she wasn’t too happy with how we were travelling, that she needed more quality time with a partner and as much as she expressed that, nothing has changed. (She never expressed it like that) the closest was sweet pillow talk of her saying (one night together a week isn’t enough) she then said I love you with my whole heart but it’s taking it’s toll on me.
She would often come over after she finish d work, let herself into her apartment when I was already asleep and slide into bed next to me, that’s how much she craved closeness. I would often already be asleep due to early starts. (It was very sweet) 
She also made such an effort with my family and arranged the most thoughtful birthday surprise for me.

So, she comes over later that night, climbs into bed looking sad and just hugs me. I said “hey let’s talk” she started saying things like “maybe we’re just on different paths”, “maybe it’s like right person wrong time” 
I said “it kind of sounds like you want to break up?” She then started bawling her eyes out looking at me saying “am I making the right decision, is this the right decision?” I was rather stoic in the moment and said “that’s not for me to say” so we said our I love you’s and she left.

The next day I felt off, I didn’t really want it to end. She then messaged my employee saying “hey, are you at work? Is Stav okay?” 

So I then reached out to her saying something along the lines of “ I’m willing to make compromises and sacrifices for us to move forward together, but if you really feel like this is something you need to do, I will respect it”

She then messaged back saying “ I love you so terribly much, but I’m terrified that things won’t change in the relationship.”
What she was really referring to later in the message was that I wouldn’t see a psychologist when I was burnt out from work… she was worried that I wasn’t “helping myself”. Now, I am not adverse to psychology whatsoever— my bookshelf is full of all the most obscure psychoanalysts from the 1940’s and have been to psychologists in the past for an ex who cheated on me and more existential things.

What I was doing was trying to employ someone for the last several months so I could take an extra day off, going to the doctors 7 times in the last 3 months as my hormones had crashed due to the sheer exhaustion from burnout. Working hard to be able to support her and have some financial freedom.

She also closed it her notes by saying she was bisexual and was terrified how I would perceive her, and she’s terrified she’s never explored that side of herself. 

I responded saying “hey, now you’ve articulated this, I think it would be constructive to talk about, do you mind if I come and see you?”
She agreed, so I went over immediately— she had been house sitting for a mutual friend, she opened the door and hugged and kissed me for several minutes. (She had been crying in bed all day) 
We sat down and communicated through everything (we had literally never had an argument our entire relationship).

We made a plan to move forward and how we just need to communicate better. I then stayed with her the next four days. Cooking breakfast for her, trying to make her feel safe.. just letting her know that “I’m here, it’s okay” 
She even said things like “thanks for fighting for me” and “are you sure I’m enough for you”

After this rekindling weekend, she came into the cafe saying “this isn’t working for me”
I felt completely blindsided and shocked.

She then started saying things like “the weekend didn’t feel how it was supposed to feel, like why weren’t you doing this the whole time?” Which is ridiculous, it’s not like I hadn’t cooked for her before. I constantly tried to make her feel supported through acts of service. She also said things like “my demons are coming back and it’s not fair you should put up with them” I said 
“Because I love you, I will stand by you and welcome your demons as my own” 
She assured me that she does love me, but love is more complicated than that- that it shouldn’t be “hard”. That she needed to try “something else— not someone else”
I asked why she was so sure? She said “I’m not, it’s just a feeling” she then brought up the fact I didn’t see a psychologist saying “why wouldn’t you get help? Why wouldn’t you help yourself? She was bawling her eyes out, kissing me with her head in my chest at this point. I was so shocked and I said “this is really important to me, you are really important to me and I will fight for this” I then proposed couples therapy, I said I will organise it and pay for it (I paid for everything) she then asked “can you give me a few days” she acknowledged how hard it would be for me but I said yes.

The next day a customer from the gym said she was crying at reception at work obviously very conflicted.
So a few days pass, I thought I would leave a coffee at reception at her work for her. So I walked over before her shift started and she happened to be early, pulling in. I was like “uhh, this was meant to be a lot smoother, but here you go” 
She thanked me and said “we’ll chat later? Because it will probably be a conversation longer than 5 minutes” so I went back to the cafe and messaged her at days end saying “hey that was by no means me pressuring you to chat, I just thought you could do with a coffee” 
She then expressed gratitude and that she couldn’t catch up that afternoon, but perhaps we could wait until after the weekend (it was Saturday) she also acknowledged how hard this must be for me and apologised for putting me through it.

I said that’s it’s okay, I then said that I would leave her with some notes following our last conversation. 
It was basically a list of what I thought were unfair presumptions on her behalf— points she was right— points I was wrong. How I was struggling with the quick flip after such a constructive reconciliation.

She then responded saying “after asking for space, you have over stepped that boundary, I’ve told you what I’m feeling and why and you have chosen not to listen- this is done, please respect my boundary” 

I waited a few days and said “hey, I really want to respect your boundary, if what was last said were your parting words, I’ll make my peace with that, if you’re still open to a conversation I’d appreciate it or if you just need more time, that’s okay too.

She then responded disregarding my message all together asking me to lug a bunch of big bags with dance costumes in them which had been in my apartment for 6 months into an uber as the dance company the belonged to needed them. I just did it without calling her out on anything. I felt so disrespected, so a couple of days later I returned her belongings to her housemate along with a letter.

The first third of the letter was holding her accountable for that action, but the rest was really heartfelt and thanking her for our time together. It was gut wrenching actually.

I heard nothing, she didn’t bother to return my things, then we found her profile on dating apps immediately. She was telling mutual friends that “I didn’t respect her boundary, and I left a 7 page letter she didn’t even finish reading” knowing it would get back to me.. as she was saying this directly to my mate that she works with. 
Some mutual friends she dances with came to the cafe, I showed them everything, let them read the letter and all. They were shocked at the level of emotional abuse and how she was contorting the narrative. Telling people that she “tried to end thing amicably” by ghosting me and getting me to run an errand?

Her instagram was wild, mutual friends were sending me the reels she was liking— hyper sexual content, “5 signs you’re dating a narcissist” type of stuff. Immediately started going out every night with people she doesn’t even like and palpably just spinning out online. A lot of bisexual coded stuff too.

This to everyone, and people that have known her for years is the complete opposite of what they’ve known her to be.

These two dancer friends wanted to get a coffee with her to suss out what is going on in her mind. On that very day we actually happened to cross paths, I was on the phone but she went out of her way to make eye contact with a sad/ longing sort of half smile.

She expressed to these two mutual friends- still quite arrogantly that she just wanted “more” from a relationship. But admitted that she handled things horribly and is in therapy. She then said that seeing me that day was kind of nice as she feels like she could reach out and apologise.

I reached out a few days later with a kind message just saying I’d appreciate a conversation grounded in respect and understanding. She responded with warmth saying “I’ve been meaning to reach out, I too think it would be good to have a chat” she then gave me a day and time. 
When that time came she bailed at the last minute. Saying that she’s been in fight or flight since the breakup and thought she’d be fine, but she wouldn’t be communicating so well in such a state.” 
I was nice and said that I understood and to take her time. I also mentioned that I had sorted out her script for anti anxiety cbd gummies. I ordered them for her before the breakup and they arrived just after we broke up. I still paid for them as a last gesture of good will.

I then reached out a few days later saying that I couldn’t hinge my closure or clarity on a conversation that may never come and I need to move forward for my own peace, and if she had space for it and if it was okay with her-if I could send a short voice message with my thoughts and that she wasn’t obliged to reply.

She replied with full hostility saying “ what more could you possibly say after paragraphs of texts (there was one text) 6 weeks prior which caused her to ghost me. I left her with the letter and was silent ever since.

She then said I had overstepped her needs for space again and again, that she got a text from the pharmacy after I paid for her script after the breakup and it felt like I was trying to buy her guilt or buy leverage.

She said “the way you have been acting since the breakup is deeply concerning, I encourage you to seek professional help so as to stop impeding on my sense of safety” 

I could not believe it… so I thought, well This will be the last time I get to say my piece so I just let her know that I felt discarded and ghosted, how it hurt to know how she was speaking about me post breakup with other people, diminishing and belittling me. That I was so worried about her because I felt I had triggered something from her past abusive relationship. Then I called her out gently saying that her behaviour has been emotionally abusive and for someone to champion psychology to not even be able to extend compassion, empathy, admission of mistreatment or any of these fundamental things is hypocrisy of the highest degree.

She then responded saying “please leave me alone, if you contact me again I will seek legal action, and please continue getting professional help”

This was on fb messenger and shockingly she did not block me, 5 minutes later she angry reacted to my first message… almost baiting me.

It has been very hard to wrap my head around how someone who was showering me in love and gratitude saying how much “healing was happening in this relationship for her” so, so anxiously attached. And so consistent throughout the relationship has flipped so violently.
I went to a psychologist immediately, I lost 8kg in 10 days and was surviving on Valium. 

It was like she was going out of her way to hurt me for no reason, telling my friend about a threesome offer from colleagues, talking openly about dating apps in front of him knowing it would get back to me. Getting me to run an errand whilst I was left in the dark.
I can’t fathom the cruelty. I was not bombarding her with messages or calls. I left her with a letter… that was it

She was honestly so wonderful throughout the relationship, there was no sign of any toxicity or avoidant tendencies.

It’s ironic that she implores me to get professional help as so many people have come forward ( her friends) concerned about how unhinged she is appearing on social media and how it’s the complete opposite of everything they’ve known her to be.
She was an extremely wholesome girl. Only two weeks before this I had surprised at work with cake and flowers and she was utterly beaming. She would constantly go out of her way to shower me in love, gratitude and affection.

something introverts and extroverts alike can do in their own way.

For me, networking doesn’t have to happen in loud rooms or big conferences. Sometimes it’s a simple coffee chat, a thoughtful LinkedIn message, or even a brief conversation waiting in line. The key is showing interest, being authentic, and following up when it feels natural.
And honestly, networking isn’t just about landing your next job. It’s about growing, learning from others’ experiences, getting advice, and sometimes just finding friends who get the struggles of your career path.

I used to stress about “making the right connections” or “impressing” people, but what really helps is just being myself. People appreciate genuine curiosity and kindness way more than rehearsed pitches or big speeches. It’s okay to take small steps and build your network gradually- it’s a marathon, not a sprint.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Story so far:

* The state of the rear courtyard of Magnor's Arcade is revealed to now be a pictureseque, romantic and serene location in contrast to its previously dilapidated state. 
* Vorque and Nive meet with Ingrid before the latter enters Autumnhollow, assuring her that most people will not be able to attribute the Whales to the slaying of the Lifebane Titan, thus buying them more time to avoid scrutiny from unwanted figures. 
* Ingrid and Zefir share a heartfelt reunion upon her return to Autumnhollow, with Ingrid admitting that Autumnhollow is her true home. Their romantic moment is predictably spoiled by the arrival of Cecil and the mice who turn things into a big fluffy cuddle pile. 
* Neith deploys smaller spider-bots with monitors to follow Ingrid and Zefir, allowing them to keep an eye on the party's activities while they prepare dinner. 
* Cuddly trains the newer Cabbage mice's marksmanship by having his Fae Harriers carry bucklers, simulating real-life conditions via fast-moving targets. 
* Philia advises Ingrid on the situation regarding obtaining a new member, which leads to news too familiar to Earth: Genocide, Ethnic Cleansing, and people in power getting away with it. She also says that Onyx, the recruit, has never had to fight one-on-one by herself, which speaks volumes about the effectiveness of her arcane phalanx. 
* Kvaris tests out the Hardhorn Spire, a deployable tower leading to unintentional phallic jokes. Instead of residing in some arcane dimension when not in use, is revealed to be in a remote, inaccessible island. 
* Philia suggests a backup plan of calling the Other Earth's Dark Empire to glass the state of Illinois, using her credentials as Dark Queen, which should work as hers were based off of an existing officer's. 
* Xefilos, a magic hoop that anchors itself to the user and assumes an intangible form. Limited telekinetic control is possible to adjust its elevation, pitch and yaw. Can store weapons which in turn can be telekinetically manipulated so long as they remain in contact with the hoop. 
* Tauven War Drums, kanabo-like clubs that generate omnidirectional shockwaves on impact. 
* Champion Effigy, a charm that shields the wearer when they are not attacking and enhances the next attack. 
* Dragon Lance, a cavalry lance that hits with the force of a dragon's kick. This, along with the Xefilos and war drums are allocated to Sammy. 
* Cleaving Vanguard, a trident allocated to Onyx that creates a cutting force along its tines on a successful strike.

Interlude 3.5

**Coming Home to Roost**

\_\_\_

**Church of Saint Ygris:**

Grand chandeliers of fairy-lights lit up the church as brightly as midday, casting a golden glow across the church's interior. White marble with gold embellishments glinted in the light, starkly contrasting to the obsidian-like accents and ebony pews. The dome ceiling stretched high above, painted with frescoes depicting Saint Ygris' ascension into the Golden Abode. Massive stained glass windows depicting key moments in the Saint's life shone with vibrant hues while luxurious curtains and hanging banners woven by faithful aristans fluttered in the light breeze.

A grand brazier burned behind the altar. making the grand window depicting Saint Ygri's image seem to move thanks to the wisps of white smoke drifting upwards. On a balcony high above, ascetics and monks sat on their heels on carpets rather than pews, maintaining their self-imposed exile from common life.

Iohann, humble as always, eschewed the seats reserved for clergy, having changed into simple robes and a veil, not to draw attention as it was clear to anyone that those who wore these humble garments were obviously clergy preferring to pray alongside the people, but to hide their identity. She ignored the glances her way, no doubt worshippers wondering who was this priest who had decided to grace them with her presence.

“...the last meal of Saint Ygris.” The celebrant, a woolly gnu priest announced, holding up a wheel of cheese. “That which was said to become unfavorable and rotten as the wheel of time spins, becomes a prized thing when cultivated the right way. We who are fraught with sin walk a path of our own choosing, for the road to holiness cannot be paved by others. At the end of our lives, will we become a beacon for others to follow despite our imperfections? Or will we let our imperfections drive us further in the darkness?”

Iohann knelt along with the congregation, uttering the silent, personal prayers while the acolytes dipped their knives into a gleaming silver bowl of blessed water, steaming hot as it was set on a brazier of burning incense. With precise, practiced strokes, the wheel of cheese was rendered in a multitude of thin slices.

The woolly gnu's throat singing hymn went on, his baritone voice echoing through the church's polished stone walls of white marble and gold inlay, mixing with the Gregorian-like choir's voice providing backing.

Those among the congregation who had completed their personal prayers chanted a litany as one, forming a third voice.

""Holy Saint of Redemption, be our wings to fly us to the Golden Abode..."" Iohann chorused with the congregation. Soon, the voices got louder as more and more worshippers finished their silent contemplation.

As each blessed name in the litany was invoked by the churchgoers, an acolyte rang a bell. The singing concluded, and the people began to line up to partake of the new consecrated meal. The priest began reciting a spoken prayer of forgiveness, followed by one of benediction, then one pleading for rejuvenation.

It was Iohann’s turn at the queue when the priest was reciting an affirmation of faith, as she approached the edge of the chancel, the jodove acolyte smiled.

""Father Clephas would like to have a word with you."" He quietly as he laid the thin communional cheese into Iohann's hands. ""Her Holiness is completed.""

""Thanks be to the Saint."" Iohann replied, rolling the thin slice into a tube before popping it into his mouth. As she made her way back to the pew; she felt a presence behind her, emanating from the altar. It was warm and comforting. The entity’s aura healing her body and soul that she almost felt tears welling up in her eyes. Predictably, as she pivoted to return to the seat, the sensation was gone, but she could still feel the divinity lingering in the air.

Even before she had consumed the consecrated meal, she was already feeling her \[Mana\] reserves welling.

**Jordi’s Dismantling House:**

Philia was quiet for a few seconds, but everyone could see in their minds her wide grin.

""Starchaser. That would be an act of terrorism.""

""*WHAT*?"" Ingrid was flabbergasted.

""Dragons are apex predators, Starchaser."" Philia explained, casually continuing her chipping off crystalline shells. ""The surface world would've been far more dangerous without dragons. In fact, if they all went extinct right now... forget dungeon-crawling. Dragons keep the monsters that bask in the sunshine in check.""

""Did it ever occur to you, Starchaser..."" Kvaris said with an amused voice, reading a scroll with one hand while examining a basket-hilted broadsword with another. ""Why outside of the Red Moon and that one Red Bear attack, we've never run into a single monster?""

""*Well, I figured they're just feeding off the local wildlife.*"" Ingrid frowned. ""*Or that people with swords and spears are just too much of a hassle rather than conventional prey animals. Besides... we've only travelled on roads...*""

""*Hate to remind you...*"" Zefir chuckled over the sounds of vegetables being sliced over a cutting board. ""*But I spent a whole year in Ontala camping in the woods with Autumnhollow well before you arrived.*""

""My former team and I..."" Peanut squeaked as she flowed her mana into a wand. She was about to say more when Viel finished deciphering the recently-manifested runes and magic circles on her scroll of identification.

“Fiend-blossom Wand."" Viel told the little mushroom, “It’s quite nonstandard. By itself it can only cast one spell, a shadow claw that flies towards the enemy-""

""Or enemies."" Peanut said, smushing cheeks with Viel as she read along with her.

""Utmost of ten seconds duration."" Viel said, rubbing cheeks with the little mushroom, ""that includes the return flight back to Kinoko. This will replenish the \[Mana\] cost... well, most of it. And then add to the wand's own. It's only in this manner that the wand can cast other spells. The spellcraft is cleverly designed such that it will seek out targets on its own accord.""

""Fire and forget."" Philia said for Ingrid's benefit, punctuated with a melodic chime as her chisel struck true. ""I used to have one, well I stole one. The projectile's fast but it's got quite a wide turning radius, so it's best used on tightly bunched up targets. That said, don't underestimate the sudden sugar crash having all that \[Mana\] yanked out of your body.""

""*What about Kinoko’s punching paws?*” Ingrid asked, “*The Vindicator Gauntlets? Having this Fiendblossom Wand would mean-*”

Peanut, still holding the wand, thrust her arm, channeling energy into her gauntlet. In response, an eidolon of her beloved friend’s paw shot forward a short distance as usual. Clawed fingers grasping the air with enough force to gouge through stone before dissipating.

“It still works, Starchaser.” The little mushroom smiled, making cute noises as Viel patted her cap.

“*Good to know.*” Ingrid said over the sound of wildly sizzling oil as she began frying something. “*So about that mission you had with your friends…*”

""We had to deal with 'terrorists', as you call them.” Peanut said, “...fanatics of the Cult of the Harvest Moon. We were in the Barony of Goessia, and these cultists came from disenfranchised former knights from that lands’ previous lord. Their loyalty was so strong they believed that if Goessia’s ‘false lord’ continued to reign, it was much better for the whole land to be overrun.""

""*Yeesh!*” Ingrid exclaimed. “*So now I have to watch out for whack jobs trying to cause a natural catastrophe. Forget nukes! Just kill a dragon and watch the world go to hell…*""

""Yes."" the little mushroom sighed, ""If we had not stopped those cultists, the barony of Goessia would have been overrun in months. Unfortunately, I have not heard of the whereabouts of the remaining cultists. For all we know they are still at large.""

""Fortunately..."" Kinu said as she held up an axe for Viel to identify, ""The dragon colony's been restored in the area and the local barony's levies have been stationed near the nest. That said, all of this would not have happened if people weren’t so lax about their dragon nests.""

""*Do we have one here in Teth-Odin?*"" Ingrid asked.

""Teth-Odin is one of the few exceptions due to the natural rift."" Sammy said, ""I mean it exists, and the security around those nests are like a fortress. That said, these noble creatures leave quickly as there aren't a lot of monsters living here in the valley.""

Kinu leaned forward to examine the now-identified axe. The shape of the head reminded her of a felling hatchet. Instead of spikes were ornamental feathers. It seemed to imply (at least to her) that it was a thrown weapon.

""The Stormcutter."" Viel said, examining the scroll identifying the axe. She glanced up at Kinu smiling as she examined the engravings of swirly clouds all over the blade. ""It uses the opponent's \[Mana\] to generate the power of lightning. It's a throwing axe. A good replacement for Night-Rider's throwing spear. We can take her ring to an Atelier to disassociate that spear.""

“*Tesla axe!*” Cecil squeaked from somewhere. There was the crackling and sizzling sound of something being cooked over a wood fire as well as the sound of crickets. Indicating he was somewhere outside the Autumnhollow house.

\_\_\_

**The Arcane Pasture:**

""Ermm..."" Cuddly murmured, munching on cheese along with the Cabbage mice as they watched the amazons spar. The hamster on his shoulder was chittering excitedly, nibbling on his own little cheese slice. The fluffy rabbit patted the hamster's head while the mice squeaked and cheered as they watched the skillful sparring the three were doing, with more than a few waving their paws holding imaginary swords, visualizing the techniques they were employing.

“Let’s take a break!” Sammy said, stretching out. She smiled as she reflected on their spar, the two of them stood their ground well when she went on the offense, but were little lacking in pressing the attack.

""Hold it!"" Amalla exclaimed, collapsing onto her butt on the grass. Her wooden sword lay a few feet away from her, bent from a fracture. ""What about situations where you shouldn't invoke its power? Like if some monster pounced on a friend?""

""I know of that axe, and it shouldn’t happen.” Sammy said. “I would need to pour a little of my own \[Mana\] first before throwing."" That reduces the chance of me accidentally harming nearby teammates. That said, if anyone else thinks they might be better off having this-""

“We have our guns.” Kaolla shrugged, patting her holstered pistol. “Along with the ones we’ve retained with us all our life.”

Sammy nodded.

""*Declined*!"" The Enthana twins said. ""*Unless there are two of them.*""

There was another chime as Philia sloughed off another shell from a crystolith.

\_\_\_

**Farmer Grace’s House, Kansas, Earth:**

""*I decline, that lightning axe isn’t for me either.*"" Philia said, still engrossed with divesting the crystolith carcasses of their shells.

Had Arek been a squeamish man who had never left his planet, he would have found the sight of another insectoid being shelled making his legs quiver, but he wasn’t. He also but then again, skin-wearing endoskeletoned people had no issue flaying creatures for food or product.

""*I don't have any rings of apport to spare and my guardian bracers are full.”* Philia elaborated, “*Furthermore, I already have explosive weapons. Spartan can't use it either, she's already dedicating her \[Mana\] towards maintaining her phalanx.“*

“*I already have backup weaponry as well*.” Selphie said, opening up the blossoms of her head branches. Kaguya put an overlay over the various blossoms.

“Yeesh.” Kaguya said “That girl is permanently on the no-fly list on Earth, that’s for sure!”

""What am I looking at, Kaguya?"" The gulan's mandibles made the clacking sounds of curiosity.

""Aside from her corrosive pollen flowers..."" The AI said, ""She's also got blossoms that are similar to Taxarian Corpse Flowers.""

The gulan leaned back, ""You're serious?""

""Unless I can bring back a sample, which is unlikely..."" Kaguya said, “but my sensors are interpolating movement along the blossom. Either they are mutualist insects or they're ambulatory seeds. If it's the latter then....""

""They get inside the body, and in the course of trying to propagate inside they unleash a deadly toxin that stuns the victim, which in turn lets them get eaten by predators which is the corpse flower's primary vector of infection alongside scavengers."" Arek mewled in disgust.

""You forget the part where the seeds read off the prey animal's body chemical signals, which means an infected animal can end up transmitting it to others, activating only when it senses elevated stress levels."" Kaguya said.

Sammy spoke up.

""*In our tribe we call them the Dreadbane.*"" The orc said, ""*We brew a potion out of it to test ourselves. Those gripped with fear will be paralyzed,*""

""*That recipe is diluted for obvious reasons.*"" Philia interjected, ""*Suika's are not. Due to her attunement with plants, she overrides the seeds, meaning even if we get a whiff of them, they just die, our enemies on the other hand...*""

""*Oh my god...*"" Cecil laughed ""*You did! Philia, you beautiful bastard, you actually did it!*""

""*No...*"" Philia sighed ""*This ain't no FOXDIE. A side effect of bioengineering is her dreadbane is that it loses its faux virulence. The protein shield from the second-generation seeds is a joke, meaning it'll only affect someone with a compromised system and even then, its drastically shortened lifespan means it's more likely to fizzle out before doing any collateral damage.*""

“Until further notice…” Kaguya quipped, causing Arek to chuckle.

“*Alright, so Night-Rider it is.*” Ingrid said, “*Anything we can give to Spartan?*”

Arek finished his coffee before speaking.

“In light of the ‘No Moving Mechanical Parts’ restriction Spartan’s phalanx has to deal with.” he said, “...a good workaround then would be to arm her with something that doesn't have such parts. We’ll use technology as a stopgap for whatever she’s lacking. I told King Fish earlier I can provide some Exegilian stun-rods, I’ve put in the order, so besides interplanetary shipping times, I’ll also need re-case in something tougher as well as replacing the electrodes with something stronger, longer and tough. That way it can still function as a spear.”

“*Thanks, Arek!*” Ingrid said.

“I can’t smuggle phasers or anything like that past the space TSA, so the best we're getting are improvised tools."" He said, “Ironically just like medieval polearms, we’re gonna have to improvise some farm tools. Like wasp-busters.”

“*Wasp-busters?* “Cecil inquired. Nod was somewhere near him, humming along while a fire crackled.

“You know the thing John MacAleese used to breach the window of the Iranian embassy?” Arek replied “Something like that but reusable. The Olinarkian wasp nests are like cement, unlike the Earth's.""

""*Sounds like those Olinarkians have a tougher time.*"" Philia remarked, sounding a little amused as she played a xylophone-like tune with the crystolith shell she was hammering away at.

""Actually, no."" Arek's mandibles clickled rapidly in amusement. ""Olinark wasps are quite docile. Earth's are complete psychopaths! I bumped into one nest when I first landed in this planet and all it took for those bastards was FIVE seconds to find the chinks in my exoskeleton!""

""*Arek resembles a terrestrial shrimp.*"" Neith explained to the Terragalian's benefit.

""*If they're that docile...*"" Zefir said over the sound of tearing lettuce, ""*Why do you even have those wasp-buster thingies?*""

""Because they nest on fruit trees."" Arek explained ""They're a nuisance. Busting their nests will convince them to find some other place and the local birds get suckered into clearing out the remainder because once they see the breach they tear the nests down, thinking they could get some free snacks out of its now-gone inhabitants. Anyway... the principle behind these wasp-busters are similar to a welding rod, but instead of reacting to metal, it reacts to bioelectric signatures-""

""*Hold it...*"" Cecil interjected,""*You said these wasps have stone nests!*""

""Symbiotic bacteria growing on the nests' surface creates a visible biofilm."" Arek explained. ""That's why wasp-busters explode on contact with them.”

“I will modify the sensors of the wasp-busters to compensate for non-living material.” Kaguya said. “More specifically, I’ll add more to it. First, it requires bioelectric contact from the wielder. Next is an impact sensor, a laser to detect movement and temperature, among other things. Long story short, it should only blast valid targets and just be a regular pointy stick when it isn’t. Speaking of which, it will need modifications as well so it functions as a spear.”

“Also,” Arek said quickly, “Just a few minutes ago I had been surfing and found another toy for our Spartan. It’s on sale at the black market, pilfered off of a wiped out safehouse belonging to Xexen separatists in Azavi-seven."" Arek said.

""*Xexens?*"" Ingrid inquired over the sound of sizzling meat.

""The majority ethnic group in the Xexelian Continent in Azavi-seven."" Kaguya explained. ""Homeworld of the interplanetary federal government of the same name. Lots of people in Xexelia feel that way. They often turn a blind eye and keep their mouths shut whenever the more radical groups commit terrorist acts and say that they can’t blame them after years and years of being ostracized. While the majority in that continent aren’t saying it. Even Ray Charles could see they want out.""

""*Assuming it doesn’t have a tracer that could narc on you, what does this new toy do?*""

Arek's pedipalps rapidly twitched in a gulan's expression of a smile. ""A non lethal crowd control walker. Looks like a terran giraffe.""

""*I'm a giraffe!*"" Zefir yelled.

""*What?*"" Cecil laughed ""*Is it gonna snowboard onto enemies at breakneck speed?*""

With a few clicks, Arek showed a video of a riot two weeks ago at the Azavian home planet. It showed footage of armored riot police wielding energy shields and shock rods pushing the unruly mob back. Most of the latter were reeling in pain as a lanky quadruped walker ambled behind the police.

“*Stop! This is an illegal assembly!*” The drone yelled, “*This is the fifth millennium, not the third! Lynching those only suspected of a crime is unacceptable! Let the courts discover first if he is innocent!*”

“*Never! Kill him! He is an Ori sympathizer!*” shouted one angry man, his antennae wriggling with anger.

“*Oris killed my grandson in the war!*” shouted one old woman, her skin flushing the color of a distressed yellow. “*All Oris are animals! Courts are for people!*”

As Arek said, the robot vaguely vaguely resembled a terran giraffe or sauropod in shape, having long legs and a longer neck where an array of sonic disruptors and strobes debilitated the crowd.

“*Please! Disband now!*” the drone pleaded, “*Let us determine his innocence first!*”

“Context?” Ingrid asked, watching the footage.

“A few weeks ago,” Arek explained, silencing the video, “...a man was suspected of having ties to the Ori, it's like your world’s neo-nazi thugs cranked to 11 because unlike your Hitler, their space Hitler didn’t shoot himself in a bunker. He retreated into space Switzerland and nobody can do anything about it.”

“*That sucks.*” Ingrid sighed.

""The bot you saw in that news footage was an Azavi riot control walker."" Arek said ,""A non-lethal suppression unit. Standard model for the Azavian Federation police forces. A combination of its suppressive abilities in conjunction with Spartan's phalanx arcana would shred the advancing monsters before they can say 'cookie!’. The bot on sale was stolen by Xexen separatists who pilfered off some surplus from the police. They use it to harass remote villages into paying a ‘revolutionary tax’ in a hope to revive the Ori.""

“*How’s that going?*” Cecil inquired.

“Like an ouroboros, nowhere.” Arek laughed. “As a whole, they’re a considerably powerful movement, but the particulars of their core ideologies shift rapidly from one chapter to the next since they lost their war. Ironically; the Ori will never take root ever again. Not when some of them think their Hitler is now a traitor for abandoning his throne and cowering in the space alps. Others think he’s not even that important anymore and just his ideals will suffice. Then there’s also various chapters who think their own head honchos are the new face of the movement so yeah… the whole outfit is eating itself alive. No sense making them an illegal party when they do all that they can to sabotage themselves.”

The earthlings snickered.

""Specs downloaded."" Neith said. ""The Azavi walker can gallop at sixty miles an hour. Its servos however are industry-standard so I recommend Arek to make adjustments in case we need it flashing monsters while we get into another car chase.""

""Request logged and canvassing suitable manufacturers who can deliver these discreetly."" Kaguya replied.

""Smaller scale anti-riot gear for your commando mice."" Arek said, showing more footage of the riot in Azavi. ""A shoulder-mounted mechanical arm, with a wide degree of motion. It can uplink to Glados, allowing her to manipulate the arms and flash valid targets. This moment of disorientation will allow your little commandos to make swiss cheese out of their targets in seconds. The good news is that these are made for the civilian market, so acquisition won't be an issue.""

""Thanks, Arek!"" Ingrid said. ""You're a real help!""

""Naw, I'm making money off of this."" He chuckled, ""I buy from the Xexen terrorists, and now they owe me a favor.""

""*Explain again why you said Xexens at the beginning and then the space Balkans in the next?""* Cecil asked. ""*Something doesn't add up.*""

""Xexelia is the continent in Azavi that the Oris have infested."" Came Arek’s quick answer.

He was about to give another geopolitics lesson when his compound eyes noticed Viel holding up an artifact.

 

Viel had been quietly examining a strange cloak. It was seemingly invisible, although it did not hide her in any way. The only hint she had a magic cloak on was the faint shimmering along the surface, as well as the lining being a mesmerizing sight of a night sky filled with stars and nebulae.

""Scanning energy signatures..."" Kaguya said. Overlaid on Viel was a translucent approximation of the cloak.

Arek saw that Viel's arms were still underneath the cloak yet her staff jutted out of it.

""Scans imply the cloak has selective tangibility, reacting solely to Viel's body but not hindering her in any way."" Kaguya observed.

""Confirn her current movement with previous footage of Viel."" Arek said. His compound eyes and gut feeling however, told him through Viel skipping around and waving her arms suggested she didn't feel any sort of resistance at all. Not even her sleeves were pulled at by the cloak, while the magical garment itself moved as if it was made of thick fabric.

Kaguya's quick calculations displayed an infographic showing Viel vigorously moving, such as her sprinting and jumping in the Other Earth's park.

""Parameters are consistent with the range of motions prior to wearing this magical mantle."" The alien AI said. ""Temperature scans however, suggest she's wearing something warm.""

Viel leapt up a tall crystolith carcass before somersaulting down, feeling no drag as she descended. She did feel the cloak automatically adjust itself back but not a single fabric of her clothes were pulled in any way.

Picking up the scroll, she began to read it.

""*The Sanctuary Mantle*,"" she declared, tracing the elegant script with a finger. ""*This cloak is best used by Cuddly*.""

""*Sounds familia*r."" Philia punctuated her remark with a chime from her chisel.

""*Cuddly's Ether Ring allows him to draw more power from the ambient \[Ether\], allowing to preserve his \[Mana\] by reducing the cost needed for his fae harriers*."" Viel prefaced in reply, ""*This Sanctuary Mantle allows Cuddly's fae harriers to rest inside the realm of his cloak, restoring them to their full potency and...*"" she paused to read further.

 

""Kaguya..."" Arek said, looking over Viel's tac-cams. ""Is it me or are those rune patterns shaped like...""

""They're identical to the alignment matrices of highly advanced stasis fields."" The alien AI said. ""The same type used to literally halt entropy.""

Arek shrugged “Siria said they’ve had at least two-hundred thousand years of history and all that time they still don’t have Elf-Hub. I wouldn’t be surprised.”

While his remark of a Terragalian Pornhub wasn’t broadcasted, the earthlings however were frozen at Kaguya’s remark of technology that could halt entropic forces.

""*WHAT*!?"" the earthlings yelled.

Arek's compound eyes saw the action unfold from the monitors.

All of the Whales looked up in surprise as all the earthlings looked shocked.

\_\_\_

""What?"" Siria and Viel chorused, noticing Philia's dumbfounded look. The ex-princess seemed to have forgotten who she was as her chisel dropped to the floor with a loud metallic clang. She quickly composed herself and jumped down, with everyone noticing her bearing a wide goofy smile.



""Is something the matter?"" Selphie asked, looking at Ingrid and Zefir's expressions.

At the same time. The mice squeaked in alarm and moved as one.

Sully, who was near the stove, quickly shut off the flame.

Aiden who was chopping vegetables with Zefir suddenly swung his knife to intercept Zefir's cleaver, preventing the citrilan from cutting himself.

""S-sorry Aiden..."" Zefir said, relaxing and patting the now-chirping mouse.



""*Something wrong?*"" Nod said, noticing the slime had suddenly froze

""*N-nothing...*"" Cecil shook to compose himself, before turning the spit once more.

\_\_\_

""You're shorting my circuits, Kaguya!- ya! This is shorting my circuits! -its."" Neith exclaimed, the terran AI's voice glitching. ""This exists!?""

""Theoretical."" Kaguya repeated, ""Still too many kinks to sort out. The rest of the galaxy has a better chance of finally using \[Ether\] which to this day only the Starchasers can use.""

""I am glitching at the idea that fantasy elves have magic that can literally stop...fucking...entropy!"" Neith exclaimed.

“That’s why it’s called magic!” Kaguya retorted.

**Jordi's Dismantling House:**  
*An hour and a half later...*

Siria and Kevain shook hands as they concluded their business for the day.

""It's been a pleasure Kevain."" The elf smiled, looking over to the neatly arranged rows of loot. All the monster carcasses not being used for immediate dismantling had been covered in her \[Deep Frost\] spell, allowing them to keep for a week. All weapons, armor, and artifacts deemed not usable were neatly lined up on carpets according to what inherent function they still maintained. All the crystoliths lay completely shelled. The trolls continued their work of taking apart some monsters and harvesting their soulstones, although these no longer required the PLT's immediate attention.

""Take good care of Onyx."" The stork croaked as he puffed from his pipe, ""I want to read from her regularly.""

""We will!"" Siria beamed, ""I assure you, she will not be left behind nor be disposable.""

The stork was quiet, considering his words carefully to ask one last question.

""And what if she doesn't pass muster?"" He asked quietly, letting the question hang in a hair for a few moments. He nudged his beak in the direction of Kinu and Kvaris who were talking animatedly with Onyx. ""...you have Amaduscia's daughters with you and your Letter of Confidentiality states you have a Nightmane tribesman, a fine tamer that has befriended Tixi mice and other fae creatures, and a Nemesis-Stalker. A fine assembly you have with you. What if Onyx does not measure up to them?""

Ser Kevain leaned back and crossed his arms, gauging the elf's reaction. He gave his approval releasing Onyx early in order to see how the Whales reacted and so far there was no indication that Onyx was simply going to be relegated to some kind of position where she would be left in danger, or at the very least, not without commensurate support.

The elf smiled warmly. If there was someone in the group he could be assured would guarantee his protege's safety, it was the aloof elf who had a genetic dislike of aristocratic fake-adventurers who only wanted meat shields.

""Onyx shall be armed to meet parity with our team, Ser Kevain."" said the elf ""And I can assure among the things we will be arming her with, and the training that goes with it... let's just say she could kill many adventurers before she herself is done in.""

The stork cawwed in amusement. The adventurers that regularly plied Teth-Odin were by no means pushovers, and the elf didn't look like she was joking at all.

""I shall trust your judgement Bluethorne..."" Ser Kevain said, nodding approvingly.

""Onyx's primary role is guarding our mages while our warriors sally forth the engage the enemy."" Siria said. ""And on the odd occasion we shall not be needing her help she will be assisting our wolian guardians tending our home.""

The stork let out a puff of smoke from his beak as he listened.

""Made some enemies, Siria?""

The elf nodded.

""Guileheads."" Siria said, ""That said, we do not know if they are aware of us. We've brought down one of their hideouts at Irons. Which is why we shall be sending you regular correspondence, we're hoping that if you have any information regarding Guileheads, we'd appreciate it.""

Ser Kevain nodded.

""That changes things then."" he said pointing in one direction, ""Leave through the west postern, not the front gates.""

""The one that leads to the back lot of the Green Dragon?"" Siria asked, her memory was fuzzy but she did know that the Dismantling House had hidden posterns leading to establishments secretly owned by Jordi's. These allowed customers bearing high-value loot to leave without being noticed by any outside observers. These in turn, had alleys and hidden passages watched by disguised guardsmen.

""Yes."" Ser Kevain said, ""From the Green Dragon I can have a wagon take you discreetly near your home.""

""That's fine."" Siria lied, Ser Kevain didn't need to know about her radio. ""We did have arrangements to leave that way after all.""

The two shook hands once again.

""It's a pleasure seeing you back, Siria.""

We have a cafe downstairs that lets us run a tab and pay at the end of the month.

Last week, I was picking up my usual coffee and overhead the cafe owner quietly telling my coworker ""Jake"" (mid-40sM) that his tab was getting pretty high - like $200+ - and asking when he could pay it down. Jake looked really embarrassed and said he'd bring cash tomorrow.

Jake and I aren't close friends, but we're friendly. He's always been nice to me, helps me with Excel stuff, brings donuts sometimes. I know he's going through a divorce and mentioned his hours got cut back last year.

I felt really bad for him being put on the spot like that. So after he left, I quietly told the cafe owner I'd pay off Jake's tab. It was $237. I figured it would just make his life a little easier during a tough time, and I could afford it.

Here's where I'm wondering if I messed up: I didn't plan to tell Jake, but the cafe owner told him the next day when he came to pay. Jake came up to my desk looking mortified and tried to give me cash. I said no, it's a gift, don't worry about it. He insisted. I insisted back. It got awkward.

Now it's been two weeks and Jake barely makes eye contact with me. He doesn't stop by my desk anymore. He'll say hi in the kitchen but seems uncomfortable. Yesterday I saw him eating lunch at his desk instead of the cafe.

I genuinely just wanted to help him out during a hard time. I didn't think about how it might make him feel - like I saw him as a charity case, or like he now ""owes"" me something, or like I witnessed his financial struggle and now he's embarrassed.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

I recently moved to Bangalore for work, and while the city’s great, life has started to feel like a loop lately work, head back home, eat, sleep, repeat. Being in my 30s, single, and away from family, the quiet evenings hit harder than I expected.

Making friends as an adult is tough. Back in our 20s, it just happened — college, colleagues, random meetups. Now everyone’s either married, busy with kids, or caught up in their own world. Even when I meet younger Gen Z folks, the mindset feels so different — they’re more spontaneous and carefree, while I’m over here wondering what to do with my evenings.

Sometimes I genuinely miss the warmth of family or just having someone to grab a coffee or talk nonsense with.
Anyone else going through something similar? How do you deal with that “work–home–repeat” cycle in a new city?",3,1760770793.0,ThirtiesIndia,8,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

What green stock is available seems to be from 2023. 

Recipe from April Coffee, slightly modified: Origami with Kalita paper, 12g beans at 3.9 on 1zpresso Zp6, 100ml first pour, second pour at 1:10 to 200ml, dilute to taste. Final drawdown should be around 3 min, but this cup ended up taking 4:50, so quite over extracted. Ended up with muted acidity, some bitter aftertaste, nutty sweetness. The guava and fruit jam notes are still quite prominent, just not as bright as I would like. Will try again with a coarser grind and see if I can get it to taste better.

I wanted to customize ""Instant Brew"", and I watched the below Fellow video. Following the instructions exactly, as in Settings>Instant Brew>Advanced>Light Roast>3 cups, the recommended coffee amount on my machine is 26.4 grams, instead of 17.6 grams like the video.

The firmware is the latest 1.4.21. Have things changed since the video was made (a year ago)? 26.4 grams seems high for a 15 oz, light roast profile. I've been drinking 12 oz, 18 gram Aeropress Americanos for years. I realize I can add whatever amount I choose, but why the rather large discrepancy? Factory reset didn't help.

“Auntie, I need to resign a month early. There’s still work to hand over, but you can arrange the rest however you see fit. I’m fine with it-sorry for the trouble.” 

“Oh, you child, why so polite?” 

My aunt laughed lightly on the other end of the phone, her voice cheerful, betraying no hint of concern.

The resignation form on the table was stained with coffee, leaving a faint brown ring. 

I traced that ring with my fingertip. Somehow, it looked like an old ring rusted into the 

skin-neither removable nor wearable. 

The computer screen was still glowing when a news alert popped up: 

“Z Corporation’s Executive CEO Rory attends charity gala with two children-‘Perfect 

Father,’ warm and devoted.” 

He was in a black suit, holding a child in each arm. 

His smile was gentle-his most practiced expression. 

My fingers curled inch by inch as I stared at the photo. 

Those two children weren’t mine. 

My child had died on the operating table. 

Even now, I can still hear the doctor’s urgent voice echoing in my head: 

“Severe hemorrhage! We need to terminate the pregnancy immediately!” 

I had shaken my head with every last ounce of strength, my throat raw: 

“No…” 

Then came a deep, steady voice from outside the door: 

“Sign it.” 

It was his voice-calm, precise, and clear as a blade. 

I thought it was the doctor asking for consent. 

I didn’t realize it was him signing his name in the “family authorization” column, 

The baby was gone.

“Be more careful next time.”

“Wendy, you’ve finally learned to be rational.” 

The wedding photo on the wall was spotless, polished until it gleamed. 

In it, I was smiling softly, my eyes still holding the innocence of that year. He stood beside me, elegant, his hand resting naturally on my shoulder. When the photographer said, “A little closer,” he frowned slightly and replied, 

“Can we hurry? I have a meeting this afternoon.”

“Auntie, I need to resign a month early. There’s still work to hand over, but you can arrange the rest however you see fit. I’m fine with it-sorry for the trouble.” 

“Oh, you child, why so polite?” 

My aunt laughed lightly on the other end of the phone, her voice cheerful, betraying no hint of concern. 

The moment I hung up, I sat at my desk in silence for three seconds. 

The resignation form on the table was stained with coffee, leaving a faint brown ring. 

I traced that ring with my fingertip. Somehow, it looked like an old ring rusted into the 

skin-neither removable nor wearable. 

The computer screen was still glowing when a news alert popped up: 

“Z Corporation’s Executive CEO Rory attends charity gala with two children-‘Perfect 

Father,’ warm and devoted.” 

He was in a black suit, holding a child in each arm. 

His smile was gentle-his most practiced expression. 

My fingers curled inch by inch as I stared at the photo. 

Those two children weren’t mine. 

My child had died on the operating table. 

Even now, I can still hear the doctor’s urgent voice echoing in my head: 

“Severe hemorrhage! We need to terminate the pregnancy immediately!” 

I had shaken my head with every last ounce of strength, my throat raw: 

“No…” 

Then came a deep, steady voice from outside the door: 

“Sign it.” 

It was his voice-calm, precise, and clear as a blade. 

I thought it was the doctor asking for consent. 

I didn’t realize it was him signing his name in the “family authorization” column, 

The baby was gone. 

When he entered the ward, the first thing he said wasn’t a word of comfort, but: 

“Be more careful next time.” 

And then:

“This wasn’t an accident-it was the rational choice.” 

From that moment, I understood-reason was his only faith. 

And I was merely the believer he sacrificed to prove it.

Three years have passed, and I still hear the buzz of that surgical lamp in my dreams. 

It shone so bright, yet gave no warmth. 

I closed my laptop and went to the kitchen to make coffee. 

The hiss of steam filled the air. I took a sip-it was bitter enough to burn. 

I looked at my reflection in the glass and smiled faintly. 

“Wendy, you’ve finally learned to be rational.” 

The wedding photo on the wall was spotless, polished until it gleamed. 

In it, I was smiling softly, my eyes still holding the innocence of that year. He stood beside me, elegant, his hand resting naturally on my shoulder. When the photographer said, “A little closer,” he frowned slightly and replied, 

“Can we hurry? I have a meeting this afternoon.” 

I nodded and smiled. 

That smile was captured forever-the image of “happiness” everyone believed in. 

Back in the study, I pulled out a folder from the drawer: 

Property transfer papers. 

Insurance. 

Trust documents. 

Everything neatly arranged. 

My life-just the way he liked it: orderly, quiet, obedient. 

My phone buzzed. It was Yuanzi. 

“Wendy, are you sure about this?” 

Her voice trembled. “Faking your death? Are you insane?” 

“I’m not insane,” I said softly. “I’m finally awake.” 

“But if he finds out-” 

“Then I’ll die a second time.” 

I smiled. “I’ve already died once, remember?” 

There was a long silence before she sighed. 

“All right. I’ll set it up. The flight, the crash simulation-everything.

1o9ovoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1o9ovoq/im_halfway_through_season_2_and_rory_is_making_me/,I'm halfway through season 2 and Rory is making me nuts with the Dean or Jess situation,"This is definitely not an unpopular opinion! I am VERY aware people also don't like Rory here.

But like, wow. Girl you are an idiot. I'm sorry, it's completely possible for smart A++ people to be naive and stupid at the same time, but she's messing up her relationship with Dean and she's refusing to acknowledge it!! (I'm watching episode 14 rn, pls correct me if I'm wrong)

It's like she's refusing to see that yk, Jess... Not a very good guy, y'know? A guy who stole charity money? Starts fights? Purposely flirts with her to make her boyfriend uncomfortable? Literally faked a murder case? SURE, HE'S A TROUBLED KID but Rory literally says ""he's not troubled!!"" in a disagreement with Lorelai on how Jess is a potential bad influence on her. He's obviously in a bad place, he has a shaky relationship with his family and his relationship with his uncle Luke was off to a bad start.

Everything pointed to Jess might not having the best effect on Rory, and yet she's so adamant on defending him, compromising her relationship with her boyfriend THAT JUST BUILT HER A CAR (and was literally demonized after their breakup because nobody cared to question what Rory did to make Dean wanna break up with her)

(Note that: I actually think Dean's reaction to Rory becoming momentarily stunned at his ""I love you"" weird and childish, a pathetic attempt by writers to start up drama in Rory's life, if I must. But the entire town started treating him like a monster, even had Luke wrestle him in public when all he wanted was a coffee??? It's just rude and completely unnecessary)

But like.... Girl.... Omg she's driving me nuts.

I think this is another part where I unfortunately have to diss Lorelai too. The line between ""mother"" and ""friend"" is very blurry between her and Rory. She's too considerate of Rory's feelings, never undergoing with her plans unless Rory is fine with it. Blah blah blah. But sometimes, as a mother, you have to set boundaries and make certain rules to keep your child away from trouble. And trouble... is Jess.

She's too nice, she respects Rory's views on Jess being a decent guy. But Rory doesn't respect Lorelai's views on Jess being a bad guy. (Ok maybe not doesn't respect, but like she's not hearing other ppl out and not acknowledge the flaws in Jess, just because she can hold a pleasant conversation with him) (""He's nice to me, that means I can fix him!"" naive ideology yk what I mean)

She's so naive it's killing me. I get it. She's a teenager, she doesn't know what she's doing!!! Okay and how many of you are teenagers who wouldn't do what she did.

 Unfortunately I do not like that boy. Wrong place, wrong time. Fight me. I'll fight Jess too. I don't like the boy.",1,1760770326.0,GilmoreGirls,1,0.67,False
1o9ovin,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1o9ovin/we_reviewed_old_man_young_muscle_a_smart/,"We Reviewed ‘Old Man, Young Muscle’ 🎯 A Smart, Joint-Friendly Way to Gain Muscle Over 50","# 🏋️ Tired of the Dad Bod? Here's How Guys Over 50 Are Reclaiming Muscle Without Living at the Gym ...

Thank you for reading our **Old Man, Young Muscle review**.

If you’re over 50 and frustrated that your **body just won’t bounce back** like it used to, you’re far from alone. Lifting heavy hurts, running’s a gamble, and don't even mention burpees.

The physical stuff is annoying, but it’s the mental spiral that hits harder. Losing strength chips away at your energy and your confidence. It's not just about how you look—it's about how you *feel* in your own skin.

That’s why [Old Man, Young Muscle caught our eye](https://theworldhealth.org/old-man-young-muscle-official). It doesn’t promise six-pack abs by Thursday or demand Olympic lifts. Instead, it offers a smarter, safer route to staying strong later in life.

One that might just let you enjoy yard work *and* your afternoon beer without limping into bed.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name:** Old Man, Young Muscle  
**Category:** Fitness & Strength ➝ Muscle Building for Men Over 50  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.8/5

# 🧠 What Is Old Man, Young Muscle?

Steve Holman, the guy behind this, isn’t a random dude with a whiteboard. He’s a former *Iron Man* magazine editor who rebuilt his body in his 60s—without heavy weights or meds.

This plan centers on **building muscle with light weights**, using a method called STX, which is short for **slow-twitch exhaustion**.

That’s just a fancy way of saying: high-rep sets come first, heavy lifts aren’t needed, and your joints don’t get wrecked in the process.

If you're looking for a **muscle-building routine after 50 that avoids heavy lifting**, you're exactly who this was made for.

It also includes a **dumbbell-only workout routine** that works with minimal gear and a no-fuss **anti-aging fitness plan** that doesn’t ask you to live on chicken and rice.

# 🧬 How It Works: The STX Method

So how does it work? You start with one high-rep set to exhaust your **slow-twitch muscle fibers**, then follow with shorter, faster reps.

It pushes your body to [use the fibers responsible for size](https://theworldhealth.org/old-man-young-muscle-official)—without pounding it into submission.

The goal is **hypertrophy workouts for older trainees** that actually feel good.

Think **low-impact strength workouts** using simple moves like incline curls, goblet squats, and supported rows - no deadlifts or joint-crushing nonsense.

This approach uses research-backed strategies to promote **resistance training for older men** in a way that keeps inflammation low and recovery quick.

It's also scalable. You can **grow muscle with minimal equipment** from the comfort of your garage or living room.

# 👥 Who This Is For (And Who It’s Not)

This isn’t for bodybuilders chasing trophies. It’s for men who want to **gain muscle after 50**, boost energy, and feel less like a rusted lawn chair.

If you’ve had injuries, hate gyms, or just want to **train safely at home**, this hits the mark. It's especially suited for guys over 60 who still want to feel capable—but without wincing through their workouts.

You will need dumbbells (up to 50 lbs), a flat bench, and a chin-up bar. That’s it. It all boils down to a **home workout for seniors** that respects your schedule and your knees.

# 🧪 Doug Was Keen to Give it a Go ...

Let me introduce you to **Doug H**, a former coworker from my health copywriting days who now runs a small boat repair shop near Oxnard.

Doug's in his early 60s, spends hours crouched over fiberglass hulls, and used to joke that the only muscle he still had left was in his coffee-pouring arm.

We reconnected over email last year, and he mentioned he was sick of feeling “soft and creaky.”

His knees bugged him after long days, his shoulders ached from years of manual labor, and gym culture just made him feel out of place.

So [I sent him the Old Man, Young Muscle program](https://theworldhealth.org/old-man-young-muscle-official) link and said, “No pressure—but I think this is exactly what you're looking for.”

Three weeks later, he texted: *“I’m sore in places I forgot I had. This thing is sneaky.”* 😄

Doug stuck with it, doing three sessions a week between client appointments. The **low-impact strength workouts** suited him perfectly—nothing jarring, just focused, strategic training that didn’t flare up his joints.

His only gripe? He wished the guide came in a more visual format. Doug's a visual learner, and flipping through PDFs on his phone wasn’t ideal in a dusty workshop.

But even with that minor hiccup, he swears he’s never felt stronger, more mobile, or more confident on the job. He’s even back to climbing into boats without bracing on the rail first.

Watching Doug reclaim his strength without pushing his body too far? Honestly, it made me believe in the plan even more.

# 📘 What About Version 2?

Doug later tried the second version too, which adds cable-based moves for variety and a few extra techniques. It builds on the first plan, not replaces it.

That one’s also laid out in a **PDF format**, and it expands the training style a bit for those who already know the ropes. Think of it as the sequel for the newly re-energized.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

Tried to order at Empire.org (thanks to Reddit) and despite being skeptical, they actually delivered!

I ordered this last September 12. I received a confirmation text by September 24, it got stuck with the local delivery courier since October 11 and finally received it today, October 18. I made sure to get the COD option to avoid any inconvenience on my part if ever it got cancelled!

Book is authentic based on the book that I first saw in the coffee shop so with a huge amount of patience, I do recommend Empire Books!

1o9otmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1o9otmk/some_type_of_inflammatory_response/,Some type of inflammatory response?,"I’ve been struggling with some type of chronic inflammation issue for almost 10 years 

So for now…. never mind the neck tension, dizzy spells weird sensations like throbbing noises in my ears, like the inside of my ears are being squeezed, etc. I’ll just share these side quest stories. 

Some years ago, I tried bulletproof coffee, where you mix MCT oil and gee butter in your coffee. I was curious about the health benefits of it, but just about 30 minutes after drinking one cup I started experiencing anxious feelings that manifested into physical symptoms like hyperventilating, chest tension, feeling like the ground underneath me in my own home was shaking. The overwhelming feeling of impending doom was enough to make me pop two naproxen and lie down until the negative sensations lifted which eventually it did. 

That was around the start of the pandemic fast-forward a few years just yesterday (10/17/2025) I’ve been meaning to clean up my my diet and one thing I tried to do was to cook a bed of eggs and throw two pieces of salmon with guacamole on top. 

I have a few friends who go keto, eat clean and are into things like the carnivore diet, and it seems to really benefit them a lot as they live extremely active and healthy lifestyles, and they always embed into me that lots of healthy fast will keep my body satiated so that when I stay away from wheat and gluten, I won’t get hunger pains 

So last night after only about an hour after eating, I experienced those overwhelming sensations like I did with the bulletproof coffee. It wasn’t as intense, but it woke me up a few times throughout the night and I had pressure in my chest for almost 2 hours and it was irritating enough to be on an alert because if that got any more painful, I might’ve been inclined to visit the ER

So my theory at the moment is that there were so many compounding variables in that day that make it difficult to figure out what the problem was exactly 

I haven’t touched any cigarettes in a while, but I do grab a vape once in a while. I wondered if tossing my vape the day before might’ve triggered some anxiety or wondered if it’s possible to have extreme withdrawal symptoms from nicotine. 

But with all these inflammation and tension issues I’ve been dealing with… I also wondered if maybe chewing multiple pieces of gum throughout the day might’ve contributed to the inflammation experience from forms of TMJ symptoms so is it inflammation or is it nicotine withdrawals? I wish I didn’t do both of these in the same day so I could narrow the theoretical research down lol 

I was also diagnosed many years ago with psoriasis and I’ve always struggled with skin issues and since I’ve had enough, I’ve been trying to see to it that I cut gluten out since there seems to be a strong connection between autoimmune symptoms and the diets full of gluten and Highly refined white carbohydrates

I found this baffling because the day I finally managed to gather some eggs, salmon and avocados….. it felt like it backfired a bit 

So I don’t know I’m just thinking out loud here and wondered if I should’ve just went carnivore that evening, haha",1,1760770116.0,ChronicPain,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Hey everyone,

I’m Asfahan (23M), planning to go shopping at **Colaba Causeway** soon and thought it would be fun (and educational!) to team up with someone — preferably a **female negotiator** who knows the art of bargaining and can help me sharpen my negotiation skills while we explore the market.

Nothing weird or flirty — just a chill, respectful outing where we can:

* Practice **bargaining and negotiation tactics**
* Find some good deals
* Maybe grab a coffee or street snack afterwards.

It’s more of a social experience for me (and hopefully fun for you too).

If you’re confident in haggling, love street markets, or just want to hang out and talk about people skills, drop a comment or DM me.",0,1760769751.0,mumbaimeetups,5,0.5,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1o9onvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1o9onvm/timemore_078_overhyped/,Timemore 078 overhyped?,"So I’ve played with the 078 turbo burrs for quite a while now and while I think they aren’t bad I honestly think that they are quite a bit overhyped. (FYI: I do mainly drink washed light roasts from the great roasters everyone knows (I have a subscription with varying coffees)). They produce a rather juicy cup profile with a good body for light roasts and are generally clean. Meaning that you don’t really get unwanted flavour notes (unless you fucked up of course). The clarity is ok but nothing special for a bigger flat burr.

But honestly: that’s about it. I don’t really find any of that unique. The juiciness and body don’t really contribute that much to most coffees and also aren’t that noticeable. The clarity works in a weid way. The very first impression is that it doesn’t really taste like anything. Then you get hit with mostly a single (depending on the coffee) flavour note for a short time and then it rolls off super quickly meaning that you don’t really have a long lasting aftertaste. There isn’t really a flavour development in your mouth. It’s really kind of boring. Coffee chronicler described it very precisely when he said that it lagged the „journey in the cup“. I don’t really enjoy that. On the other hand the SSP MPV1 64mm (brew burrs) have quite a bit more clarity with long lasting taste on your tongue and a variety of flavour after some time on your tongue. They don’t have as much body and are a bit harder to dial in though. 

To be fair: I don’t have a ton of different grinder experiences like the big names who hyped that grinder but even my limited experience and comparisons led me to the impression that the 078 turbos aren’t necessarily bad burrs but they aren’t that special either and aren’t worth the hype.

Ignoring my question, she snatched my phone, flung it into my coffee cup, and sneered with 

pure contempt. 

“Who do you think you’re photographing! What are you two old hags doing here, pretending 

to be high–society ladies just to scam us?” 

“Couldn’t earn enough on your backs? Now you’re here, probably carrying diseases! Five 

grand for sanitation fees. Pay up, or we’re not done today!” 

I fought to keep my anger under control and demanded, “Is this how Nathaniel manages his 

staff? Get him here. Now.” 

She planted her hands on her hips and smirked mockingly. “Oh, so you came here just to hit 

on my husband?” 

A little boy, barely three feet tall, grabbed a chunk of ice from the table and hurled it at us with 

all his strength. 

“Stop bullying my mom!” 

I forze, staring at the child’s face–it bore an uncanny resemblance to Nathaniel’s. 

So this was what all his “holiday overtime” was about. Not work. Not business. He was 

running a sham of a restaurant to bankroll his mistress and an illegitimate son.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o9ogtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1o9ogtn/crush_is_gonna_graduate_this_spring_but_im_too/,Crush is gonna graduate this spring but Im too scared of rejection,"So I met this european boy in high school senior year in an international science competition and we kinda clicked. At the time, I already got my admission to a prestigious tech school in the US and we started talking. Later, as I was tryna expand my network I was sending facebook friend requests to people who were already students in the tech school before the freshman year started. 

One of them was this boy's previous teammate Tom and he was also studying in the tech school. He messaged me and said he knows me and that his friend (let's call him Kevin) told him about me. And we started talking, mostly logistical stuff orientation and things but he was really sweet. So he had a pride flag in his previous posts so I thought he was gay (apparently he was bi). He started putting heart reactions to all my fb stories and I just assumed he does it to be polite as I had very low self esteem and never thought some boy actually can be attracted to me.

Well, with Kevin things got kinda messy, as I flew to US and he in Europe, my 17 year old ass really wanted a long distance relationship but he was kinda not sure. But we dated a bit, and he was applying to my school as a transfer student. But transfer resulgts come out on May so we kinda were on and off but things were never certain and i basically wasted my whole freshman year on this.

Meanwhile Tom was trying to be close with me and stuff and he was kinda into politics. he once made a political joke about my country and I got real mad. Looking back he probably was just trying to connect as he is generally socially awkward. But I will say he helped me with a lot of matters when I arrived on campus and was very nice. But after that I kind of said mean things to him and basically cut him off.

Then after a while, I started missing him and also learned he is actually bisexual and not gay. We also broke up with Kevin so my mind got more clear. I started making a lot of mean jokes about him with my friends but at some point I realized I have a crush on him, this was after a year btw.

And then at some point, I saw him on hallway with my friend and he asked me sth, but out of insecurity and nervousness, I laughed. It came off as if Im making fun of him. He said ""Good"" and nodded and left. Then i wanted to apologize but also kind of hint about my feelings.

So i wrote this on a paper- ""Sometimes I act weird around you, but there is a reason for that. Turn the page to see the reason."" AND on the next side of page: ""Because I am autistic, i got diagnosed this summer. I didnt really take it seriously but I guess it is true lol. If u are curious and want to discuss more about this, u can reach out to me at this number- \_\_\_\_\_"" and at 11 pm ish, I slided it from his door. (lol i knew his room because he used to let me keep his things in his fridge) 

He reached out to see who i am and i made him guess for 3 hours. At the end I just said it. i asked him for coffee but he ghosted me. Later I learned he was taken at the time. 

But then they broke up after 3 months and he started replying to my stories and he even once commented on my post. But mind you, this wasn't fire emojis and stuff. He himself runs a meme page, so he would laugh at my jokes and ask me some questions. I added him to close friends and he started doing there too. But Im just too scared to continue the convo and potentially get rejected/ghosted. So i just give short dry replies or like the message. When I see him in the hallway i also just act nonchalant, but he blushed the last time. I am a college junior now and he is a senior. Im so scared that he is gonna graduate and won't know or I wont know. But these days, the feeling is really strong and I cant run away from it. And he also makes some effort i think but im lowk scared. Thoughts?

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'm selling a 1-year Brave VPN subscription.

To be super clear: the subscription **is active** (it renewed about a 2 weeks ago), so there are **11 months remaining**. The most important part is that it is **not yet binded to any email account.** If you buy it, I will bind it directly to *your* email address during our meetup.

**Reason for Selling (RFS):**

I need to be transparent. I accidentally let a free trial renew. My card was charged **₱4,990**.

I've been stuck in a frustrating support loop trying to get it refunded:

* I requested a refund from Apple within 20 minutes of the charge. They rejected it.
* I've talked to Apple support and senior advisors, who told me to contact the developer (Brave).
* Brave's support emailed me saying only Apple can issue refunds.
* My bank (PNB) also said only Apple can help.

Basically, I'm stuck. They're all just pointing fingers at each other, and I'm the one who's out the money. Since it's not tied to my email, I'm just trying to sell it to recover my funds.

**The Deal:**

* **What:** 1-Year Brave VPN Subscription (**11 months remaining**, to be bound to your email)
* **Original Price:** ₱4,990
* **My Price:** **₱4,000** (You still save ₱990, and I get most of my money back.)

**Payment & How:** **MEETUP ONLY** in the Metro Manila area (a safe, public place with Wi-Fi like a mall or coffee shop). I want this to be 100% transparent and safe for both of us.

This way, you're totally sure you're getting what you paid for. I can even show you the email chain with Apple and Brave support as proof if you want.

I have a quick question so currently I’m taking lisinopril 20mg for a while now the cough it’s gone but I noticed it something really weird when I take my medication every day at the same time all it’s fine or after five or seven hours could be more could be less my blood pressure fluctuates to 150 or 170 or 180!! Which is a lot and it stays like that for around five minutes and sometimes a few times it stays like that for like 3 hours it doesn’t stay like exactly at that number. It goes down and up down and up. But the goal is to be below 130 most of the time! I am retired so I don’t do heavy work and also I don’t drink soda or coffee. My appointment it’s coming up so I can discuss with a doctor but would love to see your opinions ! Maybe the medication lisinopril doesn’t work on me they way it should? Before I was taking 40mg but that made my BP go down to 80 or 90 I felt so weak so my doctor reduced to 20mg which I feel excellent but just noticed those bp spikes it’s kinda like a roller coaster 🎢 most of the time I’m below 130 but then booom 160 out of nowhere !

In February '24, I (F 52) started a flirtation, a fling, with someone (M 52) that I was just getting to know on a friendship level. We both agreed that we didn't want anything more, we had both, fairly recently, come out of long and not so great relationships.  We've had actual intercourse once, barely. I've given him oral, 4 or 5 times and this is over the course of about 1½ years. To this day he still calls me baby and kisses me hello and goodbye most days, unless he's got his panties in a twist about something, if that's the case then he just hides in my spare room playing with his hot wheels. Oh and these kisses are all very chaste, I mean I've had more passionate kisses from my Mom (God rest her soul).

Within 6 months he lost his job, blew the engine on his car and 2 months later was thrown out of the place he was staying by his roommate. I offered to drive him to job interviews and even let him use my car to drive for Uber. When his roommate tossed him out, I was there helping him pack and offered him my couch for a couple of weeks so he could get back on his feet.

When he first moved in he was all about helping me fix the place up, whether it be painting, fixing a door or putting up my cat wall. I never had to ask, he just jumped right in and did it. It also didn't hurt that he's an amazing chef, self taught.

Here we are, just over a year after he moved in, he still uses my car to Uber and to run to any and every store imaginable because he recently started collecting Hot Wheels cars (which he has something like 3000 of now). He has never once given me a penny towards car insurance,  although there have been times when the car needs something thay he's gone out and bought and put it on/in the car. There has also been times where he says the car needs xyz and doesn't do anything about it until I order whatever it is.  As a matter of fact my car was making a strange sound last week, took a week for him to figure out there wasn't any transmission fluid in the car, not a drop. Not to mention the fact that he owes me $3500+ that he still hasn't given me a dime towards. 

He finally got a job a couple months ago, which i drove him to and picked him up from (45 minutes one way)... he didn't last 2 weeks,  talking about it's too far away. Had the engine replaced on his car, only to blow it again a month later. It has since been repossessed. 

I have a puppy that I put weewee pads out for and between the 2 of us,  we have 5 cats (two with special needs). He will, on a regular basis,  walk right past a soaked weewee pad even if it has poop on it. He will clean litter boxes once a month or so and always makes a big production about it. There are times that he will feed his cat but not the rest of the animals. He's never once helped me with rent, although he did give me $150 two different times when I was stuck. I got so backed up with bills that we lived without electricity all summer long. He got 2 or 3 tickets on my car months ago that he still hasn't paid. When it comes to food, I guess it's sort of split down the middle. 

Oh, let's not forget that my place is disgusting. I've told him from day one that clutter makes me crazy, because it looks terrible for one and it makes it damn near impossible to clean around. Yet, he's got crap all over the place. I'll clean off the kitchen table, which is where we eat, and within an hour or two it's covered with a bunch of his crap again. I used to try to keep up with the cleaning and straightening up but it's a losing battle, so I gave up. I keep my bedroom clean and organized and spend the bulk of my time in there. My thoughts were maybe he will see, finally see and start cleaning up and he has but still will only do the bare minimum. When I used to take my stuff to the laundromat,  I'd take his stuff too. He would usually show up during my last 15 minutes there to ""help"". When I stopped doing his laundry,  I didn't go do mine either (I have more than enough clothes to last me weeks without doing laundry) just to see what he would do. After bitching for weeks that ""we"" need to do laundry, and he found himself wearing clothes for several days at a time, he finally got his stuff together and did laundry while I was sleeping, but didn't take a stitch of my clothing.

That brings us to yesterday, I don't drink coffee, water, juices, etc, really all I drink is pepsi. Over the course of this year, if he didn't have any Coke left,  he'd ask of he could have a Pepsi. My response never changed, of course you can, help yourself, all I ask is you never take my last Pepsi. After I wake up, wash up and start getting ready for the day I go to get my last Pepsi, unfortunately it was gone smh. Now I'm annoyed but I'm getting ready for work and he's sleeping so can't say or do anything about it right now. I get home from work and I'm guessing one of the cats may have knocked over a box of borax in the bathroom because it's all over the floor but the box is on the counter. If he was awake, I'm sure he heard me loudly say ""WHAT THE FUCK? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?"", I also tend to slam things when I'm pissed,  so there was definitely some slamming of doors. He didn't show his face, so before I did something I might regret I went to my room where I stayed for the rest of the night. I got up today and the bathroom had been swept, sort of... it was just moved to a pile next to the bathtub. 

AIO? I've absolutely had it, he needs to go, I can't live like this anymore. I don't even know how to broach the subject (would love any/all advice on the best way to get him to leave), partly because he has anger issues, partly because I don't like kicking people when they're down and partly because I know he really doesn't have anywhere to go. Keep in mind though, he's left twice over the last year (never once asked if I would be/was ok or if I could handle things on my own) and the second time I told him I didn't want him back here. The only reason I allowed it was because that was when he was picking up his car, but I specifically said only for a day or two at most and he agreed, that was like 6 months ago.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Mas nalungkot ako nang bigyan ako ng flowers.,"I've been sad for the past months due to multiple reasons. Only my boyfriend is the one who has kept me entertained and felt wanted. Although today, I was sad as usual and while on call my boyfriend told me that he had something delivered for me. I got excited hoping for food as I did tell him that I just had leftover stuff from the fridge. Or coffee since I told him I'll be locking in for school. Instead, I was greeted by a grab driver giving me a plastic bag of a bouquet of flowers. I couldn't even see the flowers kasi may plastic na nakabalot. I thanked the driver and went back sa dorm ko. Naiiyak ako, di ko sinasagot ung calls or text ng boyfriend ko.

For further context, this is not the only time this happened. Nag away kami earlier in the relationship and he also did this. Nagpadala ng bouquet via grab tas di man lang nakapresent ng maayos. Tinanggal ko pa ung balot na plastic rin. Sorry daw and di ako natuwa kasi I believe flowers are meant to be given personally. Iba pag yung tao mismo nagbigay sayo kaysa pinadalhan ka lng. Okay gets na you want an easy fix, a fast solution. Pero wag naman sana yung ganto. Magkikita naman kami bukas, sana bukas nlng nya ibigay saken.

Anyways, I know I'm not the best at relationships but it's the fact na I've told him off once for doing the same thing before and eto na nmn. Ang hirap ma-appreciate yung gesture kahit gusto ko, naiiyak ako.",0,1760768308.0,OALangBaAko,7,0.5,False

They look like they’re having fun and aren’t at all concerned about COVID. I don’t talk with most of them anymore so I can’t possibly know how their everyday lives are, but why are they out living their lives how they want without consequences? Meanwhile, so many other people are suffering from LC and experience disability. I tell myself that consequences are likely not immediately apparent, but I would be lying if I said that I didn’t feel some resentment sometimes. I also want to be very clear that I don’t ever wish for any harm to come to these people. 

I have always been a homebody and my life isn’t vastly different, but I miss some things like seeing live music or having coffee at a cafe and reading a book. I feel frustrated when I see that other people are still doing these things unmasked and have been for years with seemingly no consequences. I also feel frustrated by the fact that my precautions and values are pathologized. I’m angry that again, it is always the most vulnerable who are treated as disposable. 

I’m also sure there are folks out there who are experiencing LC and don’t know it. 

Not sure where I’m going with this. I think every now and then I go through cycles of grief about the world we live in. What does the future look like with COVID? I really don’t know. The unknown is scary but I try my best to take it day by day and will always remain firm in my values.",39,1760768264.0,ZeroCovidCommunity,13,0.99,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

When is the best time and the best way to do this?","So im not a stranger to dirty talk in bed. Sometimes my wife likes to be called a slut or whore when we are having sex, but today she randomly sent a tik tok video of  guy getting in a car saying ""be a good girl and get in the truck im taking you to get coffee"" and said ""why cant you be like that. So I thought she meant like when going to the store, but after thinking about it texted back ""so you want to be called a good girl?"" And she said ""in bed yes.""

Now shes never mentioned this before and it kinda took me by surprise but im down for it if thats what she wants; but im not sure 1)the best time or way to do this (like is it better to do this at the start or while doing a specific act or towards the end and 2)how not to ""go overboard"" with it or make it feel like ""im saying the specific phrase to much.""

Honestly I dont think I would have ever used this phrase in bed but if she wants it then I want to do it for her, but I want to execute it right so it doesnt make her feel like its said empty, like I want it to have the weight that she want it to have. Especially since she, even tho I always encourage her to be open about it, can be pretty shy about her fantasies.
