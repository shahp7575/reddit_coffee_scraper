My wife and I are embarking on a really exciting new chapter, shifting gears after over 20 years in the corporate world to pursue our passion for coffee roasting! We're aiming for a ""crawl, walk, run"" approach to building a small business.
We've just started our learning journey, diving into books and YouTube, and even getting our hands dirty with a $30 popcorn popper. As many of you probably know, while it's a start, it's not ideal for serious learning or consistent results!
Our next big step is to invest in a ""real"" roaster. The goal is two-fold:
 
* Continue our learning journey with a machine that offers proper control and feedback.
 
* Start getting feedback on our roasted coffee from friends, family, and eventually sell it at local farmers markets and other small venues.

Here are a few key considerations we're grappling with:
 * Home-Based Operation (initially): We plan to continue working out of our home kitchen for the foreseeable future. Our aim is to truly master the craft and test the market before even thinking about a commercial space.

 * Flexible but Step-Function Budget: Our initial idea was under $1500, but we understand that might be too limiting for our goals. We're now more flexible, but we want to make sure each investment moves us significantly forward without overspending unnecessarily at this early stage.

 * Build Quality & Consistency (and Ventilation!): Consistency in roasting is paramount for selling. We also need to factor in the necessary modifications for a safe and effective exhaust system, given we'll be operating from our kitchen. This is a big one we're trying to wrap our heads around, especially regarding home kitchen safety.

We know this is quite ambitious, but we're incredibly motivated and inspired by the idea of creating something of our own.
We've started looking at some specific models across different price/capability tiers and are feeling a bit overwhelmed trying to decide the best fit for our ""crawl-walk-run"" plan:
 * FreshRoast SR800 (with Razzo/extension tube mods): This is on the lower end of the cost spectrum. We're concerned if it will truly offer the consistency and capacity needed for selling, even at a small scale.
 * Gene Cafe CBR-101: A popular drum roaster for home use, seems like a step up from the SR800 in terms of control and roast consistency.
 * Hottop KN-8828B-2K+: Appears to be a solid drum roaster with good control and build quality, often considered a workhorse for serious home roasters.
 * Kaleido Sniper M6 Pro: This one recently caught my eye in another Reddit thread, looks very capable with good Artisan integration, possibly a bit more budget-friendly than the Bullet, but still a significant investment.
 * Aillio Bullet R1 V2: Seems to be the gold standard for prosumer/small commercial, highly regarded, and has a great community, but it's the largest investment on this list.

We would deeply appreciate any guidance, insights, or mentorship from those of you who have been on a similar journey. What roaster would you recommend for our specific goals and constraints? Any advice on home kitchen setup, particularly around exhaust systems for these types of roasters (and any relevant experiences with local health/fire codes in Virginia for home-based food businesses), would be invaluable.

Thank you for taking the time to read this long post and for any advice you can offer as my wife and I begin this exciting new chapter!",1,1751688950.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

I can eat the heaviest amount of food during the day and I'll be fine. Somedays I'll stuff myself with chocolate and I'll be fine. 

Dare I eat some small thing during the night? I'm done for. I start having reflux and nausea, and my sleep is ended. 

I don't want to do an endoscopy, I really don't. But I still want to get this sorted out. The GI I went to wanted me to do an endoscopy and ultrasound with extremely minor symptoms, and they probably won't help me if I refuse it, I guess. 

Anyways.. what are your recommendations? I'm starting to think of not eating dinner at all, or having one slice of plain white toast. This is really fuckjng up my mental health. ",1,1751688856.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
1ls18en,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurship/comments/1ls18en/the_lows_are_lower_than_the_highs_are_higher/,The lows are lower than the highs are higher.,"A quick tale of woe, and reminding myself that I chose this path for the highs while all I’m experiencing rn are the lows. 

Fourth of July on a Friday is fittingly giving me the most brutal of reality checks.

I chose the entrepreneur journey over a decade ago. Spending every free moment consumed with the whole thing. 

Going through the typical phases of overdosing on motivational YouTube videos, trying every new trendy flavor of the month business idea, then choosing something more deliberately. Started a coffee brand, it flopped, started a social media marketing agency, and that flopped too. 

Then I’d bide my time, do more research and repeat the cycle. 

This was all time I had spent after working my day job. Every weeknight and weekends. Being an introvert made it easy to spend countless hours by myself working on my projects. Sacrificing a social life for the dream of creating the next big thing. 

Today I spent the 4th with my family. After the BBQ, we went to see the fireworks. Afterwards as we were leaving the park, I was chatting with my brother who had chose the stable 9-5 job route. 

His evenings and weekends were always filled with socializing at the bar and hobbies. I used to judge him for that. He hates his job, makes shit pay, so why doesn’t he just try to start a business like me? What a dummy!


Tonight, as we walk around a community of people chatting and joking and enjoying themselves, I felt the burn of being a lone wolf. With nowhere to go and nobody to spend the rest of the holiday weekend festivities with. 

I asked my bro what he was doing afterwards and he said he was going to a bar and then meeting up with some friends at a different spot to shoot pool.

I had no plans besides the plan I’ve always had for years, sitting by myself at home working on some productive activity like making a YouTube video or refining a business plan. 

And tonight it hit me. I don’t regret my decision to chase entrepreneurship but I certainly regret sacrificing a social life in the process. 

One day if I’m lucky and my efforts pay off, I’ll have made it and will have the money to afford going out and socializing and having carefree fun with my new friends I’ll make.

But I’ll be the new guy that nobody knows and doesn’t care to know that bad. 

In contrast my brother has a huge network of friends, and solid relationships he’s built from spending every weeknight and weekend out socializing for years and years. 

Tonight I truly feel foolish and envy him. I was so locked in when I should have at made some time to unwind.

I will now start spending every Saturday night out socializing and building relationships. It might be too late to build lasting lifelong friendships but I’m the type that can’t stop talking and thinking about business which makes connecting with the gen pop that much more difficult. 

One other thing that I’ve realized is that I still can’t stop trying to build something great. 

I don’t know if you feel me on this but it’s where my head is at and it’s feeling bittersweet this journey, it’s like I love it but feel like I’m not prioritizing the truly valuable thing to have in life: relationships. 

Got to win or it will truly be all for nothing.

You ever feel like Sylvester Stallone in Demolition Man. Dont know how to use the 3 sea shells. Dont worry Brother... we have all been there. 

Here is my advice on this topic for the curious.   
1. Try to poop before you leave home... every time.  
2. If you are in a household that is Tabo only have you own wipes ready.  
3. Put hand towels and a bin for them in the bathroom.  
Proceedure.  
\- Fill the big bucket with water and place tabo in it in front of the toilet.  
\- get that clothing off and hang it on a hook or somewhere clean, out of the blast radius of the toilet.  
\- Get the liquid hand soap next to the bucket.  
\- apply hand soap to exit.  
\- Poop  
\- Create a funnel with either hand (palm up finger tips together and facing your \*hole)  
\- Poor water rinsing the area   
\- when you think it is clean use a wipe to test. (clean again as needed).   
\- apply soap again. and rinse.   
\- Use a hand towel to dry.  
\- refill big buck and flush. (clean toilet with brush) and flush again as needed.  
\- wash hands, sanatize hands.   
\-Get dressed and clean up bathroom as needed.

Outside the house... Find a Boss Coffee or Shakey's Pizza... they have good bathrooms. Discover places like that as backup plans. In the SM and a lot of places there are condom style machines that dispense TP and Wipes for like 5 or 10 PHP.... Always carry wipes and a sealable baggy in case of no trash can.

And it’s crazy how much they charge for these shits, dudes using fucking templates and shitty WordPress yet couldn’t do a better job than a toddler. And the money they’re known to have charged is insane, like wtf. No wonder why the field is dying and nobody trusts web devs anymore.

I wanna make an impact, change and a powerful note that development is not the same anymore. I’m working on a personal project called Project 100, helping 100 small businesses with their online presence, also involving redesigning already existing garbage web apps. Screw those people who still use old tech and talk like it’s a big deal. I streamline dev using modern frameworks and tools, and I’m solo, you don’t need a team working on such small stuff and you don’t need tons of middlemen, managers and shit. I can cut down the cost to flat 200 CAD per page which includes all services.

I lost my oldest son in a car accident 10 years ago. He was in the backseat, driver was speeding, lost control. He was wearing his seatbelt, but some car accidents are so catastrophic, it just didn't matter. Y'all know what followed. The darkness. Crying until you run out of tears. Other people seem to be just as hurt as you. Then once the funeral is over, they just go on with their lives while our world is completely shattered. Right? 

I'm here to give you some hope...if you feel like reading this. The first year was hell. But the time came when my wife and I started smiling again. Then the time came when we started laughing again. Even got to the point where we didn't feel guilty about it. We eventually got to that Acceptance stage of grief you hear about. I got there much sooner than my wife, but it still took me quite some time. While I was going through the worst part of my grief and felt hopeless, I came across what I'm going to post below. It gave me hope, so I wanted to share it again. Maybe it will help someone like it helped me. Hang in there. You'll come out on the other side stronger than you could possibly imagine.



As for grief, you’ll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you’re drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it’s some physical thing. Maybe it’s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it’s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don’t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you’ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what’s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything…and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it’s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O’Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you’ll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don’t really want them to. But you learn that you’ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you’ll survive them too. If you’re lucky, you’ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",2,1751688303.0,ChildLoss,0,1.0,False
1ls11py,https://i.redd.it/tq3wl6sxbzaf1.png,Review #11: 2025 Rare Character Limited Release Batch 1 KSW,"BACKGROUND: This comes from Rare Character Whiskey. A brand sourcing, blending, and finishing whiskeys in Lexington, Kentucky.

NAME: Rare Character Limited Release (RCLR) Batch 1 Kentucky Straight Whiskey

DETAILS:

“This batch began with a foundation of 5.5 year old Kentucky-distilled wheated bourbon that was blended with 8-year and 15-year Kentucky rye bourbons. Bottled at cask strength with a run of 2500 total bottles.""

133 Proof

5.5 - 15yr Kentucky Straight Whiskey

MSRP Price: 79.99

\--------------------------------------------------------------

NOSE: Warm and inviting. Like breakfast at a coffeeshop. This nose is cinnamon roll frosting, coffee cake, and fresh bread. It is light and bright. There is something EVER so slightly citrusy after repeated nosings if I dig deep enough. Like a dollop of limoncello being dropped on a truck stop pastry. This is very bright. Im not getting any of the nuttier or more savory notes I would usually expect of something with this proof. I expect that the blend might be heavy on the wheat whiskey with how delicate that nose seems to be after a while but I could be wrong.



PALATE: Very sharp. Those citrus notes seem to be elevated a bit but I get almost a spicy sweet roll dough feeling after rolling it around in my mouth. Like ground up red hots on Pillsbury morning rolls. A lot of the buttery frosting notes seem to fall back as I swish it around. 



FINISH: The finish is extremely peppery and fairly long. Whereas the nose betrayed the high proof, this finish revels in it. This is spicy oak, bread crust, and black pepper rolled into one. There is a hint of stewed dark fruits I get when breathing back through after swallowing. After adding a small bit of a water, I get a stronger note of black cherries. Not tart, but almost like older black cherries scraped along an old chest. Weird note I know... but its what I think of.



OVERALL: This is interesting and a fun way to break up tastings that are too ""over the plate"". The nose bats a bit higher than the rest of the whiskey but the finish is such a unique way to experience muted cherries and wood. If you can get it for under 100$ I highly recommend purchasing.

**AITAH For not planning anything for fathers day after my husband ruined my first mothers day**

----

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/bxVVhHt3hq): **June 16, 2025**

I'm 98.7% sure that I am not the AH here, but I'm wrong I'm willing to admit it and learn from my mistakes.

Our little boy will be one late this summer, so this was the first mothers day and fathers day for both me and my husband. My husband asked what I wanted for mothers day. I didn't want/need anything big or expensive. What I asked for is:

* For husband to get up with the little guy and get him fed while I pumped and chilled

* Breakfast in bed - just toast, scrambled eggs and coffee

* For us to take the little guy to the zoo for the first time. This was the main thing I was looking forward to.

* Go to my fav taco place for dinner

Between morning and afternoon naps we have about 4 hours of awake time. The zoo is abt 30 min away so I had figured if we left as soon as he got up from his nap and ate, we'd have a couple hours at the zoo and worst case he could sleep in the car on the way home.

We took my mom and my MIL out to brunch the prior weekend to celebrate them- his mom on Saturday and my mom on Sunday. I also got them each a thoughful little present and flowers to celebrate their first mothers day as grandparents. I arranged everything and told my mom and MIL that we'd be celebrating on the actual day with just our little family and sent them a group chat (which included husband, my dad and FIL) just to make sure everyone is on the same page. My MIL is very pushy and overbearing so I didn't want there to be any surprises or confusion.

The Saturday before Mother's Day, FIL sent my husband a text with a picture of all the mulch he just had delivered and said something like ""gonna be a busy weekend!"" or something like that. Apparently he had 300 bags of mulch (they have a big yard with lots of flower beds). That night my MIL called my husband and asked him to come over first thing in the morning to help his dad move the bags of mulch to where they were going to be used. She said since we weren't going to the zoo until after little guy's nap, that husband could go over and help for a couple hours and then come pick us up to go to the zoo. I was obviously not happy but she guilted him and said FIL was going to end up hurting himself if he moved all that by himself and that its not a big deal and should only take an hour or two. I told him his mom was doing this to try and get us to skip our plans and spend the day with them but he kept saying it's not a big deal, saying his mom promised it would only take a couple hours, etc etc.

I think most people know what happened - husband went over first thing, which means no breakfast in bed and I had to get up to feed the little guy. I was kinda pissed, but whatever. Spent time with the little guy then when he went down for his morning nap I texted my husband to let him know he should start wrapping things up. Then when little guy woke up 2hrs later I called husband to tell him I'd be ready to go as soon as I finished feeding the little guy. He told me it was taking longer than he expected but that he'd hurry. Like an hour and a half later husband called and said they weren't done but he was getting ready to come home. It's 15-20 minute drive from MIL/FILs house. At that point we'd missed the window to make it to zoo so I told him to just stay there and finish and not worry about Mothers Day since he hadn't done a single thing I asked for. I don't think there wasy any doubt in his mind how pissed I was. A little later his mom called and said since we decided not to go to the zoo, that me and little guy should go hang out with her while ""the boys"" finished with the mulch. I admit that I was pretty pissy and told her I had no interest in spending time with the people who decided to ruin my first mothers day. I ended up staying home and ordering a pizza and binging Netflix.

When husband got home he was all apologetic and asked how he could make it up. I was still pissed and told him he could make it up by not ruining my first mothers day. I also told him he should plan on spending Fathers Day with his mom and dad bc me and the little guy were going to go celebrate Fathers Day with my mom and dad.

Since Mothers Day MIL has been texting and calling but I've been keeping conversations short and just giving very bland generic responses.

My husband has been apologizing and asking what he can do but honestly I don't want to bother. I know it's just a day and we can celebrate any time, like we did with my mom & MIL. But it was my first ever Mothers day. And it's not like I asked for anything expensive or difficult. The only difficult thing is he's incapable of setting boundries with his mom. And she's incapable of considering anyones feelings but her own.

This past Saturday he asked if I was still going to my parents then said he'd like to go with us. I told him he could do whatever he wanted but since I hadn't done anything for his dad he might want to go see him or something. We did both end up going to my parents and spending the day with them. It was actually a nice day. My dad insisted on grilling because of course he did but the weather ended up being nice and we spent a lot of time hanging out on their deck playing with the little guy.

I'm not sure what if anything my husband did for his dad. I know he was getting a lot of texts during the day, I assume from his mom. She did send me a snippy text saying it was hurful to spend the day with my family at the expense of husbands but I told her she got to spend Mothers day with her baby boy so it's only fair that I spend Fathers day with my family.

I know my husband was hurt that we didn't acknowledge him for Fathers Day but I told him while we were driving to my parents house that I'm just matching his energy. I admit that I haven't done anything to de-escalate the drama but I'm still just so hurt he continues to prioritize his mom's feeling over our little family. This isn't the first time his mom has done crap like this and I'm just so tired of it. She always oversteps and insists on doing what SHE wants. I'm doing better at keeping her at arms length and holding my own boundries but my husband is absolutely incapable of it.

EDITED to fix a typo

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA

Look at the shiny spine on you!!!! Your husband should take notes!! You're a badass and I wish I had your spunk. Ask him why he'd rather be a good son than a god father? When is his child going to matter more than his mommy's fee fee? Im proud you're not letting her get away with her shit. What about Christmas? Birthdays?

> **OOP:** So far it's been a lot of the same. Technically we've tried to alternate holidays or celebrate with one of our familys on a different day but his mom calls & texts nonstop if we spend a holiday with my family. I already told him this Christmas we are spending Christmas Day at home, just the three of us. That should be interesting to see what tricks MIL pulls out.

**Commenter 2:** NTA

Although, you knew your husband wasn’t go to make it by the time your son woke up. Why didn’t you just take your son and enjoy the zoo?

> **OOP:** I really should have. I think I was trying to convince myself he'd come though for us. Lesson learned.

**Does OOP's own mother do the same thing like her MIL?**

> **OOP:** lol actually my mom & I get along really well. She can be overbearing and pushy too with the difference being when I tell her to back off she does. But she said the same thing a lot of people her are saying. That I'm justified in my feelings but if we end up going down this path we won't be married for long. She thought I should accept his apology and let it go and give him the chance to do better.

**Is OOP's husband an only child or does he has any siblings?**

> **OOP:** We're both only children. But his mom is waaaaaayyyyyyy more invested in his life than either of my parents. My mom can be a pain, but when I ask her to stay in her lane she usually does.

**Commenter 3:** Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think your anger and hurt come from the fact that your husband would do it again.

He seemed more sorry that you were upset - kind of like he was looking to you to tell him how to undo this - instead of being sorry that he hurt you.

You have a MIL problem, but you have a much bigger husband problem!!

This wasn’t an emergency so it didn’t need to be done that day. You both need to get into counseling - individual for him, as well as couples counseling.

If he wants to fix this, counseling is a must.

> **OOP:** You're 100% right. It's because this kind of thing has happened lots of times. But this time it ruined something that I thought was really important to me

**Downvoted Commenter:** Your husband isn’t your child. He’s not supposed to do anything special for you for Mother’s Day. He can acknowledge you and that’s enough. He should be doing something special for his mom. Your children will celebrate you when they are older. When your kids start celebrating you then you’ll know what Mother’s Day is all about. Side note: yeah it would’ve been nice if he celebrated you the way you want it to be. But you’re also a grown woman, you should’ve just left to the zoo with your son and enjoyed yourself.

> **OOP:** So expanding on that theory, I was under no obligation to celebrate him or do anything for him on Father's Day and I did the right thing by celebrating my dad?

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/tAW2NQyTJc): **June 23, 2025 (six days later)**

I posted here last week, you can find it in my profile if you want the backstory. I wanted to thank everyone. I've had a lot of people asking for an update, so here we go.

This weekend the husband and I sat down and talked about everything. I expressed to him how incrediably upset and disappointed I was at how both Mother's Day and Father's Day went down. I really wanted to recognize and celebrate my husband for FD everybit as much as I hoped he would recognize and celebrate me for MD. He said he knew he shouldn't have gone to his parents on MD but didn't know what to do since his mom was pressuring him and saying if his dad got hurt it would be husbands fault. He admitted that he knew he messed up and has been terrified that I was going to ask for a divorce.

Since he cut to the chase, I told him that if this is how our life is going to be, I don't want to stay married to him. I explained to him that I realized that while yes, I was upset about what happened on Mother's Day, that isn't what is making me feel this way. That was just the straw the broke the camels back. This kind of behavior from his mom has been happening since we before got engaged and has just escalated. This has been happening for YEARS. As someone here suggested, I had listed all the times/events (that I could remember) that she had overstepped or just completely ruined. For our freaking honeymoon, she called him TWICE A DAY. Every monrning to find out our plans for the day and then every evening to hear how the day went. Plus the constant texting, asking for pictures, telling him how much she missed him. I don't know how I thought this was acceptable. She tried to make our wedding about herself, tried to make my pregnancy about herself, tried to take over when we brought our son home, just constantly inserting herself and overstepping.

I told him that I don't really want to get divorced right now, but it's going to happen anyway, I'd rather get divorced now while we can still do it amicably. Because if nothing changes I'm going to end up so angry and resentful that it would make divorce very contentious and I don't want that for our son. At this point we were both crying, upset and emotional. So I told him that I'll give him some time to decide what he's going to do but if I don't see clear effort being made to start prioritize me and our son that I'd move forward with the divorce. And the change has to continue. Everytime we've fought about this in the past, he's promised he'll change and sometimes he has, but then his mom pulls him back into her orbit.

If we are to stay married - these are some of the things I'm insisting on in no particular order:

* We each own the relationship with our own parents. That means I'm not planning anything for his parents anymore. No cards, no presents, no burnches or parties, no pictures, nothing. If his parents reach out to me I'm going to redirect them to him.

* I'm not entertaining or visiting with his parents when he's not around. I'm not taking our son over to theirs by myself. And if they ""drop by"" I'm not inviting them in unless my husband is there.

* I'm not changing my plans at the last minute just because they decided to drop by without coordinating with us in advance or because they want us to do something with them.

* Neither of us makes plans with our parents or accepts invitations until we discuss with our partner. And if we don't both agree the we don't do it. And we don't throw each other under the bus, we just say something like ""we checked our schedule and we're not available"".

* Holiday's like Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc are at our house. We can discuss inviting our parents but we're not going to someone else house to celebrate something involving our son when we can do it at home. This includes his 1st bday which MIL is trying to take over and plan.

* Other holidays we're alternate between our parents. And we will focus on being present. That means no more texting/talking to his mom non-stop when we're with my parents.

* No more oversharing with MIL. She doesn't need to know about our finances or health/medical issues or vacation plans or anything unless we both agree its something we want to share.

* His visits to his parents can't be at the expense of spending quality time with me and our son. I don't mind him visiting his parents, but he's over there a couple times a week. We are his immediate family now, we should get priority.

* We're not doing things just because she said we should. And we're not changing our plans just because she doesn't like them. She really doesn't understand that ""Wrong"" and ""Different"" are not the same thing. In her mind, if we're not doing what she wants, HOW she wants, then we are in the wrong.

* He needs to go to therapy with someone specializing in emeshment. And we need to start going to couples therapy. I didn't even realize I have so much pent up resentment that I can't look at my husband the same anymore. I'm just angry at him all the time and I hate being this way.

* When it comes to our son, our word (husband and me) is law. If she disregards or minimizes our decisions for our son, then she looses access until she learns to behave.

* When me or my husband say ""No"" to either set of parents, the other person will support them and back them up. That means my husband has to stop trying to get me to agree with his mom all the time.

I can tell he's freaked out and really stressed about the idea of putting hard boundries in place or distancing from his parents. And I do feel for him. He said he feels like he's caught between a rock and a hard place and that me and his mom are both putting a ton of pressure on him and both have conflicting expectations. And that's fine. He just needs to understand that I'm not tolerating this anymore. I know this will cause an absolute shit storm with his parents but I feel like if we don't do it now, it'll just be harder down the road.

What does everyone think? Am I being unreasonable? Are there other boundries we should put in place?

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You need a timeline, can’t say do all this and then in a year say hey you didn’t do check box 3 and 4, I am out. By September we’ll have had a counseling session together and he had 2 on his own and we had a family trip (just 3 of you) to the seaside or something. Put dates down, so by new years if things haven’t improved you can call a lawyer.

> **OOP:** That is an excellent idea. He did seem overwhelmed, and admittadly it is a lot. I wouldn't expect it all at once but this is where we have to end up and I have to see progress and change. I'll sit down with him again tonight and start having that conversation. I want him to be successfull. I want US to be successful. And I'm willing to put the work in and to also help support him, but he will need to do the same.

**Commenter 2:** I think you should remind that if you divorce he will have the same problem with the next person. Does he feel ready to keep having his parents ruin his relationships?

> **OOP:** That is an excellent point! I think his mom is at least partially responsible for some of his earlier relationships ending. I'll make sure to point this out!

**Commenter 3:** Nothing you’ve written is wrong or unfair, but it’s already not looking good for you. He admits that he knew he messed up and was terrified that you were going to ask for a divorce, but is also freaked out and stressed about the idea of putting hard boundaries or distancing himself from his parents. There are only 2 ways I see this going: 1) this man will fail at putting up boundaries with his parents, you will resent him for being the spineless mommy’s boy that he is, and you will get divorced or 2) he will succeed at putting up boundaries with his parents, he will resent you for making him choose between you and his parents, and you will get divorced.

> **OOP:** #2 did occur to me, and I fully believe it is a legit concern and possibility. But I feel like this is my last chance to try and turn this around. If it happens, that is on him. And I think it will just show that he'll never be ready or able to have an healthy, adult, romantic relationship.

**Commenter 4:** My advice to you is start calling it out and explaining it in the moment.

She calls and he jumps to take her call: ""Name, this is our time together and you are once again prioritizing your Mom over us.""

He divulges private information: ""Name, would you like me going and spreading private information to my family about you? Because what you are telling your Mom is PRIVATE. Adults keep that information within the confines of marriage just like sex.""

You need to find that couples therapist and set up the appointment ASAP. Tell him the date and time and tell him if he is serious about saving the marriage you expect him to be there and you expect him to show up weekly. Lay it ALL out for the therapist.

> **OOP:** Thank you for this advice. I've always hesitated to do this because I didn't want to come off as a nagging wife, but I realize now I was just enabling the status quo. But you are right, we need to have some way of providing feedback to one another and being able to communicate in an open and healthy manner even if the underlying topic is toxic

**OOP on how much personal information her husband shares with his mom**

> **OOP:** If my husband wants to tell his mom about his health, that is entirely his choice. But why does he need to tell her about my health/medical issues/Dr appointments/etc? Why does she need to know how much I earn or how much I have save up or how much I paid for my car or any of that? How is that her business? If we decide to take a trip why do we need to tell her how much we're spending?
> 
> And why does visiting her take priority over plans we made? I can't count the number of times we were doing something together where he bailed because she needed help with something stupid. Or the number of times plans got canceled because suddenly she wants him to come over.
> 
> If he wants to devote all his time and effort to his mom that is absolutely fine. But he can't do that and still be an involved father or engaged husband. What happens when our son is older and my husband has to choose between attending his school events or games or whatever. Because yes his mom won't be around forever, but our son won't be a child forever. What happens in 18 years when our son goes to college and my husband realizes he missed seeing him grow up because he was busy catering to his mom.
> 
> And I won't be a third wheel in my own marriage. I won't spend my marriage wondering what plans she is going to screw up or what decisions we make that she's going try and override.
> 
> It's not about sharing info or visiting. It's when those things happen to the extreme and impact our life as a married couple.

**How old are OOP and her husband?**

> **OOP:** Early 30s

**OOP should had addressed those issues before she got married to her husband**

> **OOP:** We absolutely should have addressed a lot of these issues before we got married. Or before we had kids. Or really at any time in the past.
> 
> But is it really a long list? I mean, they all boil down to the same thing - we both need to treat each other with respect and consideration. For example, my issue isn't him visiting his parents. The issue is when his visits conflict with plans we've made or activities we're doing or when they constantly take time away from our son. Before I accept an invite from anyone I always double check with him to make sure he doesn't have anything else planned, is it so much to hope he'd do the same for me? And once we do have plans, is it ok to have to cancel them because his parents want us to come over? This isn't one off stuff, this is constant.

**OOP on her husband's background and how he was raised from her own parents raising her**

> **OOP:** The way my husband was raised is so different from how my parents raised me. I feel like I need to understand his upbringing better to understand why he feels like he needs to always defer to his parents, especially his mom. I do believe at the end of the day he alone is responsible for his actions, but understanding his past better might help me to be more empathetic and to have a better idea how to help save our marriage.

+

> He hasn't told me a lot of details about how he grew up. He has told me that his mom has always been very pushy and domineering. He's alluded to getting in trouble for not getting good enough grades or not doing his chores correctly and got punished but he never said anything about how he was punished.

**OOP on how her MIL has overstepped the boundaries**

> **OOP:** Thank you for the feedback! And I think you are right - I am conflating what *I* view as a normal healthy relationship with what *I* think is overstepping boundaries. I don't remember if I put it in a comment or a DM, but I admit that I did put that list together when was angry. As a result, I think maybe I was focused on the wrong things in some cases. Or maybe not the wrong things, but the wrong aspect of the things I listed.
> 
> For example - I legit think his mom calling 2x a day on our honeymoon is weird because my family wouldn't do that. But in retrospect, maybe frequency of calls wasn't the problem. Maybe the problem is that he let those calls cut into our time together while we were trying to do other things. If he had talked to his mom while I was in the shower or some other time we weren't busy, I might have thought it odd but it I wouldn't have felt like she was overstepping.
> 
> Likewise I complained about how often he visits them. But it's really because he allows those visits (or requests for visits) to take priority over activities that we were already in the middle of or plans we already made (e.g. Mother's Day).
> 
> I've said this several times, but I should have put it in my original post - those specific items are area's where she has caused problems. BUT - for the most part they all boil down to the same thing: I believe me and my husband show respect and consideration for each other and when there is a conflict or a question, our family should take priority. And since people on Reddit like to read everything as absolutes - even priority is relative. If his mom wants him to shovel mulch, that should be a lower priority than what we already planned. Not saying he shouldn't help, just that he doesn't need to do it right then and there.. But say his mom fell and hurt herself on Mother Day, or some other legit emergency came up, then absolutely THAT should take priority over going to the zoo. My frustration and anger and resentment comes from ALWAYS being a lower priority than anything his mom asks for.
> 
> For the record - NOWHERE did I ever say I thought he should cut them over or sever his relationship with them (something a lot of people have accused me of saying). What I want him to do is realize that now, in addition to being a son, he is also a husband and a father. And he needs to decide which of those things take priority.
> 
> Thank you for the great feedback and for the very valid talking points I can use with him. Ideally, while we are in couples therapy to help with the discussion.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/Q06pN42Bur): **May 10, 2024**

I (41M) have two kids with my ex wife, (42F) a son John(22) and daughter Sally (20), I'm remarried to my wife (28). I'm very close with my kids, my son is engaged to Abbie, she seems nice but has been a bit pushy trying to create relationships with me and my wife, though she's also awkward with her. Abbie isn't close to her family, she told us many stories why and while some of her complaints don't seem awful, it's not my place to judge and I didn't live it so I can't know anyway.

We've tried to be welcoming but Abbie has forced her way into some family traditions where she wouldn't have been invited, and some where no one outside of specific family would have. She has been calling Sally ""sis"" since they were only dating a few months, has an odd sister/mother-in-law thing she does with my wife, and the one I'm not a fan of, wants me to be like father to her. Not because we've clicked or anything. We are very different people, not saying that in a bad way, just saying it's not based on how we get along or anything.

My kids and I have a tradition when they come over that we have a private catch-up in my office/study before they leave, which is now even more important to them because while they both get along well with my wife they don't want to have personal conversations around her yet. Abbie asked if we could talk, and after I explained the tradition John later asked that I do it, saying she'd never had a caring conversation with her dad. 

We compromised that I didn't include her in the tradition but do join the two of them for coffee and let her talk. Then she started calling me dad, they werent even engaged yet, John pulled me aside and begged me to give her that, laid this whole thing on me about me always being the dad she always wanted right in front of her and she just wanted that, told me she cried watching me and Sally together (she still gives me random hugs, I'm a lucky dad). I didn't like it but I do feel bad so fine I gave her that. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and the father/daughter dance. I don't want to walk her down, and I walk with a cane so dancing is hard. At my own wedding I only danced twice. John is begging for me to do one, preferably the aisle.

They came over Sunday, John and I were talking, I thought to address it, when Ab walked in without knocking, asking if he'd told me yet. I asked what, John said she wanted me to say something about having a second daughter now in my speech and how I loved her. I just looked at him. She asked if I'd do the walk and dance for Sally, I said of course. She yelled she's my daughter too and I said it will never be the same, Sally is my actual daughter. I tried to explain I'd talk about her being a happy addition to the family and I love how happy she makes Jack, which i thought was a good compromise, but she started crying. John apologized and they left, but he called me when they were home nearly begging me to. AITA because I won't lie and say I love her or she's my daughter.

**Original Post Verdict: Not the Asshole**

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/cU032DTxqi): **June 26, 2024 (1.5 months later)**

I had planned on writing this sooner but life got in the way in a couple of really good ways, but people were helpful and asked for updates, and I have a surprise free day, so here it goes:

Mother's Day my kids and their partners go to visit my ex wife. So it turns out my ex wife and Abbie are a lot closer than I realized. She calls her mom, which is part of where this comes from. Also apparently my ex has been egging it on. On mother's day they were talking about the wedding and I guess whenever Abbie referred to me it was as dad. My son apparently told her let it go, which led to yelling. 

Abbie about deserving to be my daughter, ex telling her that she's right, son telling her that I am trying and she should be realistic about things, Sally telling her I only had one daughter - which was apparently a response to Abbie saying to her that as my ""daughters"" they should be united. according to my son Abbi was crying, according to Sally she was crying ang yelling and kicked something before going to her room, and Sally told me she went off on her mom, but will not elaborate so I don't know what was actually said. But knowing Sally - whoo boy.

Around 2am I got a text from Sally's partner's phone saying ""Abbie really is great, she hasn't been perfect but you should give her a chance and you will learn to love her."" I saw it when I woke up I tried to text her back but was blocked, so I called Sally but they were driving. They stopped by my place later that day because I am on the way and my daughter prefers my liquor and cooking and they told me about the night before. 

At the end I asked to speak to her partner alone, I asked if I had done something to upset her. She was confused and I told her I was blocked. She said I wasn't but checked her phone and I was, and I said it was after her message and she asked what message. I showed her, it was not on her phone anymore. At that point we brought in Sally and caught her up, neither of them were happy.

A couple of days later John and Abbie dropped by unannounced; not something we really do in this family but ok fine, I had mad salmon, does not take long to cook. I cook 2 more, wife serves while I make drinks. The entire night was Abbie trying to bring up the wedding, John trying to change the subject, Abbie not allowing that. 

We talk logistics because I am helping them get some good deals through some professional contacts I have when finally she just says ""so I was talking to mom, she said that you can walk me down the aisle and she'll do the dance, or you can dance and she'll walk, it's your call but you need to choose soon."" 

I reiterated that I could not dance (she tried arguing that I had danced a little at my wedding but I made it clear that is different) and did not feel comfortable walking her. She got upset and said ""mom loves me why can't you?"" I felt bad but couldn't lie, I pointed out that she had John who loved her, my exwife, friends, she had people who love her. She said ""but other than (ex-wife) those aren't my parents"" I said ""neither am I."" She was very emotional so my wife and I gave them a few minutes.

My son and I were alone later, he looked exhausted. He said the problem was that after Mother's day Abbie had called Sally and kept saying they are both my daughters, that I did not get to be close with one but not both, and that it was them against me - but at that one Sally cried havoc and let slip the dogs of war. Things were said. Grievances were aired. John had to hang up before it got worse, but I guess Abbie was shaken but there was a new problem; Abbie had decided in her head that I did not mean what I have been saying and was just doing it for Sally. He told me he would handle it.

Ron Howard: He did not

So now I get text messages from Abbie every couple of days acting like we have a secret relationship Sally doesn't know about, she even called herself my secret daughter and lol'ed. She invited my wife to lunch saying ""2 out of 3 of his girl's"" going out. She has even started using the pressure of showing up at events like a recent barbecue to play a certain image. She hugs me more and holds it, wants to do pictures with just me or my wife and I but always a few with just me to post with captions I do not like. 

My wife is getting especially annoyed because of how she is with her (I guess Abbie surprised her with father's day plans for me that had to be shut down, as it is she still inserted herself into the day) but she has a soft spot for her and when Abbie gets emotional she caves; my wife is a sweetheart.

I asked him if he is upset with me and he said no, he just wished it was different. He said we're good, but he's worried he and Sally aren't, which is when I took the advice of some people and suggested pre marital counseling, he said he would talk about it. Abbie is insisting Sally go to her fitting. 

That shop should pay-per-view that potential royal rumble because Sally is not holding her feelings back anymore. I told him Sally loves him and I'll talk to her, but for now it is stressful all around. Abbie driving my wife crazy with her ideas for what my ""girls"" should be doing, driving me crazy with dad-daughter content, drove sally to the edge, and oh yeah, last night sent me an email with 3 styles of father-daughter dances and song options, so i'm not feeling any more respected or heard than before. 

The six of us have barely been in the same room in order to let things calm down since father's day, which was great until it was a shit show. Sorry this is so long, with all the craziness this is still the abridged version. We are supposed to meet Friday, Sally's partner and I have a bet going about how bad it will go. So onward and upward, I hope you fathers had a less dramatic day than I did, and by any chance does anyone know exactly how bad of a crime I need to commit to enter witness protection? Just curious

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/vY1O52Txmv): **October 2, 2024 (3.5 months later)**

I have gotten requests for updates on my situation, and as I enjoy a refreshing mojito and my wife her nojito, life feels good and the perfect time to amuse the world with my pain and familial drama! Plus a cousin of mine who apparently reads these and knows my situation gave me the convincing argument of ""dude, you can't keep people hanging"" and how can I argue with that airtight argument. I apologize for how long this is, a lot has happened.

My wife's pregnancy is going well, keeping her as stress-free and pampered as possible has been my focus. It is such a different experience this time, both because of how much more involved I can be and how much better a relationship I have with my wife than I had with my ex. My daughter Sally has been great, even her partner has been great, helping with the nursery or driving her around when I can't. My wife doesn't know because it is a surprise, but my son has been building a crib for the baby, modeled after the one I built for him and his sister, to show my wife his support. My son is a good man, and he is still in there, he just has a soft spot for Abbie. Which I guess gets us to the part of the movie where Godzilla shows up and starts busting up buildings...

So I called a family meeting with my kids to talk about the situation. Told John his sister was only doing wedding activities she wanted to and that the guilting requests needed to stop, that this was hurting his relationship with his sister. Sally was happy I said it so she did not have to yet again. I told him if he did not stop her from messaging me I would block her with a bluntly honest explanation why. We got a lot out, John seemed to understand but then a few days later they insisted on coming to talk. Sally and I decided we would get everything out. 

So all of us ate at our place, Abbie started in immediately about baby shower stuff and I told that is the kind of thing we wanted to talk about. I told her that I understood she has been trying to fill a hole that she has, that she thought she was getting a father, a second mother (she calls my ex-wife mom apparently) and a sister. I told her it was still possible but that she needed to start listening to us. I told her that for the sake of family we would give her a fresh start, if she agreed that moving forward she would respect our boundaries. My daughter did not love this idea but loves her brother and was willing to try. 

Abbie tried to say that since we were starting over we could define what the relationship would be and just be family, we told her we were not ready for that, that it needs to happen organically. She got mad that I am closer with my daughter's partner, which is true but we just get along, and that she deserved it for trying so hard. My daughter said something about trying things we actually want. She ran to our bathroom, he ran after her. After a while I checked on him, I could hear her repeating ""this is not what I wanted."" My wife, daughter, and her partner went out to the patio to give them privacy and salvage the night, after a bit I got a text saying they had just left.

I checked in with him the next day and he said they talked more at home and she understood. For a couple of weeks things were good. The texts stopped except the occasional wedding question, since it was getting closer. She stopped pushing herself on my wife and Sally, and we thought was involving us in less in wedding planning out of respect, since as it was they only got the venue at the rate they did because of my professional connections and they know I was willing to help but not interested in helping plan, even if I am good at event-planning. 

But then I got a call from the venue telling me the card I used had been declined. Now this is a specific card I use for big purchases because of the miles so I knew it had a high limit. That was how I learned that they had changed dates by two months despite being informed I would still be out much of the money because it was too close to the date. I was furious, I mean I have been lucky in life financially but I am not blow-off deposits like nothing wealthy. Called my son, said he needed to get his ass to the house, just him. They both came.

When they arrived I opened the door, she actually started with, ""Dad!"" I think I just replied ""you have got to be f'n kidding me"" and walked toward the table. Abbie had the nerve to ask where dinner was, my response was not polite as I made it clear that was not why they were here. I hoped my son would not lie to me so I asked what was going on with the venue. She started going into wedding details but my son interrupted to tell me they postponed because my ex-wife was unavailable because of a surgery and he had not told me because he was putting money together to pay the lost money himself, and he had just reached out to guests to let them know. And that is when Abbie's mouth opened...""we have extra time to work on our dance...""

Now during this time my wife came home, and i was walking her toward the bedroom when Abbie said that. My pregnant wife with me I said, calmly, ""I have different feelings about that and will elaborate further shortly"" or something like that. Then I laid my wife down and got her water, turned on her symphonic covers of popular songs and walked back to the table and said something like ""You are out of your f'n mind have you even been listening?!"" I made it clear I was done with this nonsense, we all were, and kind of lost it asking she did not hear us last time because her head was up her ass. She was stunned silent (what a beautiful sound) and looked at me while I, admittedly with little filter, explained what Sally and I thought of our time with her and her attempts to force us to love her without even getting to know us. She started crying and stood up and shouted ""then what was this even for?!"" 

John asked what she meant, if she meant them and he started to freak out. She was frantic and said she meant delaying the wedding. Because, and I'm pouring another drink to write this, it was a ploy! My ex-wife and her decided if I HAD MORE TIME I would come around. Apparently my ex told her not to worry about the money because ""I am loaded."" She has always been bitter I make so much more than I did when we were married, as if that is out of spite rather than my career arc. I think she did that on purpose, frankly.

But she not only told me that lie, she and my ex told John as well. He was distraught. Repeating ""you lied to me"" as she tried to spin it but he was letting it out about how much he has defended her and covered for her and she lied to him too. She was defensive and blamed my ex for telling her things and me for being stubborn, she yelled ""why can't I just f'n call him dad"" and, finally, after so long, I heard John respond ""because he is not your f'n dad!"" She started crying and something about his being the one that told she could call me that and he said he told her she might be able to eventually but he had told her again and again to slow down. She started sobbing and went to sit on her chair but missed and fell on the floor. Appreciating physical humor to break the tension I admittedly chuckled and hid my mouth behind my drink, this all led to a lot of sobbing. I said I needed to check on my wife and as I walked out she was repeating ""I just want him to be my dad too.""

I came out and he was walking her to the door and apologized, I said not too, they left. He came over a few days later and said they had a long talk at home, he even asked her if she would have dated him if there was never a chance of being in the family. He believed her when she said yes but she admitted I was a big draw as well. I was the kind of dad she always wanted, my relationship with Sally is what she always wanted, and the way she said it gave John doubts that she loves him for him. I talked about marriage counseling, how his mother and I tried it and, while it did not save us, it provided clarity and an impartial voice. I pointed out they both like coming to me, but I cannot be impartial and if they are trying then they need to do it for real.

Abbie texted asking if I was the one who suggested therapy, I responded with ""does it matter if John wants to?"" She asked why it is so bad she wants to know what I think and I just said john is the man whose opinion should matter most to her. They fought due to the text, she agreed to the counseling and the wedding has been postponed!! I may have done a dance. So they are in counseling, he said she struggles but I obviously do not know details. She is pressing for me and Sally to go to a session with her, Sally told her she did not want to hear Sally unfiltered, and I am not interested. Abbie has been leaving Sally alone, she stopped texting me except for the occasional general question which include some attempt to go deeper. My wife still occasionally spends time with her because she is very into her pregnancy, more so than I like but it is my wife's call. So that is where we are, sorry it was so long but alcohol makes for a poor editor.

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/u/GreatestThrow-man/s/duDEjbeuXu): **November 20, 2024 (1.5 months later)**

I was told I should do updates here, people have been asking me to, and to get into what went down on father's day and at their mother's house, I have been extremely busy these last few months but am enjoying my temporary unemployment and thought of this account because of recent thanksgiving drama. I will do a an update and then will share what happened earlier. Oh, and to whomever made the joke that Abbie finally got me to dance, that made me laugh, I shared that with the family.

My time has been largely caring for my wife, I tend to dote, I know. We are having a boy! We are really excited, though neither of us really had gender preference. I have raised both and both experiences were wonderful. Now we are discussing names, who we are going to honor. I thought everything had been quiet, but recently found my wife crying and found out I was wrong. Given how busy I have been with work, and my wife knowing I would be free again once we got into this month, my wife has kept this to herself. Apparently Abbie has been pushing for one thanksgiving this year. Things have been quiet with Abbie, my son said the wedding blowing up woke her up, and that therapy had been helping. But then this.

My understanding is that while John has been talking less with his mother because of all that happened, Abbie did the opposite. From my wife's telling, Abbie dropped by one day with my ex wife. My wife intensely dislikes my ex wife because of lies she spread about my first marriage ending due to infidelity with her, despite their being no infidelity and the linear nature of time making it impossible for us to have slept together back then. Before anyone asks, my ex wife does not actually think there was infidelity, I would get into that, but I am sure I would sound biased.

Anyway so my wife looked at our camera app, saw who it was and called my daughter; apparently the two of them were keeping things from me because I was working 18 hour days and they did not want me dealing with anything else. I wish they had not done that, but I appreciate the thought. I am really lucky to have such caring people around me. My daughter called her mom and said something that made them leave in a hurry, she will not tell me what but she smiles when I ask. I called John but he was dealing with somehard work news, so I just was there for him and left the other alone. 

The next day Abbie came back, alone this time. My wife saw it was her and asked her what she wanted through the door, Abbie said to apologize. My wife let her in (she is too nice) and after a nice talk Abbie asked about the whole family getting together for thanksgiving, my wife said of course, she assumed as much. 

A couple of days later in our groupchat we were discussing details, who brings what, and Abbie asks what else is needed. I say John already committed and she asked what about my ex wife, what should she bring. In the time I have known Abbie she has never made an intentional joke that funny, so I asked what she was talking about and she mentioned the ""whole family"" comment, and my daughter and I both asked what made her think we counted her as family?? She actually replied ""she is my family. i don't have a dad who wants me, just a mom and my mom deserves to be with family on thanksgiving"" 

Sally replied ""well we'll miss you and John then."" Abbie asks how she can say that, Sally asks how she can be so stupid, John says not to call her stupid and I say that is fair but there is no real way she thought my wife thought she meant my ex wife(at this point my wife had filled me in). And then...this is so stupid...she uses my son's phone to add my ex frigging wife to the group chat. She then thanks us for the invitation and asks what she can bring! As I was typing my daughter beats me to it and asks what she thinks she is doing, she knows she is not welcome- but says it less politely. My wife types ""you could not have thought she was included when I said family."" Abbie responded that she was not coming as my family but as hers.

Sally let her mom have it, she already is not talking to her much and said if my exwife is there then she is not. I mentioned there was never a chance ex was going to come and said I understand Abbie and John wanting to go to their mom's house so she is not alone. John typed ""plans not definite, will let you know"" He has since told me that he is not going to go to his mom's place but wanted to tell Abbie alone first. All I can think about is the comment about not having a dad who wants her, because it means she is still thinking about me as a dad, I believe. Just a negligent one. I mentioned that to my son and he said he noticed it to and had brought it up at therapy, because family is such a frequent topic, though I obviously do not know details.

Wow I thought this would be brief but that was a lot, I will get into the crazy stories later if there are people seeing this who want me to. I do not know how posting from here works in terms of anyone seeing it, but this has been good to get out.

[Mini Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/GreatestThrow-man/s/oaP9htBEkF): **December 13, 2024 (almost one month later)**

I do not have time to elaborate right now but I am so excited I had to share this, Thanksgiving went so badly that my son called off the engagement itself and is now going to stay at our place while he figures out his next step! 

He came over Sunday night exhausted and asked if he could use the guest room and we talked for a couple of hours, I understand a bit more why he felt trapped now but he realizes if she does not see her issues then he cannot help her with them. I am taking him and his sister for a fun day on Saturday to just have some fun, he looks so tired and just needs some fun. 

Hopefully, while yes things are messy, he is moving in a better direction for himself. People here have been great and genuinely seemed to be rooting for him which I appreciate, so I just thought I would share the good news. Happy holidays, especially mine as he told her she was not invited!!

[Update on life, sorry it is long](https://www.reddit.com/u/GreatestThrow-man/s/7XydOsmLOZ): **May 14, 2025 (five months later)**

Life has been busy but great, but I have a lot of requests for an update, and people here have been really great so I figured that I should. To start, my wife and I have an adorable sleeping potato. He has made us both so happy; my wife, sleepy as she may be, is the happiest I have ever seen her. I had paternity leave and then various family took over helping my wife. My kids have been great about helping, my daughter has been having fun with her brother for the first time in a while. I am not going to provide details because my wife would not appreciate that, but I will just say that my wife had a scare late in her pregnancy which led to my kids really being there for her, and they pretty much have been since. They even got in my Mother's Day celebration for her. My wife loves it; she is really feeling the love.

My kids are doing great. Great news is that my daughter and her partner are engaged! They have a very specific idea of what they want to do, and I was asked to walk both of them down the aisle. That was too much for me, I am not a big crier, but I admit I contributed to the happy tears we had while all hugging. My daughter asked my son to be her best man (they are both having a best man and maid of honor) which makes me deeply happy, because I do not think he would have been her choice a year ago. They are definitely getting their relationship back to normal. My son had work issues because of federal cuts and had to change jobs but he is really happy where he is now. I used money I had saved for his wedding and bought him a getaway trip; with the job stress following the personal stress he dealt with, my kid needed time away. No Abbie, no job stress, no family (I think we are pretty great, but we spend a lot of time together and I figured he might need a week away from us too). It was not easy separating from Abbie, she and his mother made it difficult for him. My ex-wife tried seeing him through Abbie, and my son was having none of it, especially after a public tantrum at his old job (it was a public-facing position with his office info online) that really embarrassed him. She would not dare do that to Sally. Neither of my kids have anything to do with her. Abbie made a couple of dramatic attempts to get my son back, but my son was clear with her. She has been out of his life and he is visibly relaxed. He is living in a new place, close to his new job. He even mentioned putting himself out there a little while ago.

A couple of months ago a young woman joined our shop, she is very personable, funny and attractive. Our work includes receptions and work socializing, so I have gotten to know her a little, she seems fun. She has mentioned dating and being single a couple of times when we have talked, so I asked my son if he would be okay to give her his number if she was interested, and he was. They have gone out a couple of times, it does not sound like a great fit, but when he was talking about how attractive she was I could see he was enjoying meeting new women again, which frankly all I really hoped for. It got him excited to go out again and got him some confidence back, so whatever happens it was successful as far as I am concerned.

So, things are really good. And there is going to be a wedding! I have been helping plan it, their ideas of course. It feels like we have gotten through something together, now I am over here shepping nachas, just overflowing with joy. Our little one, eventually an upcoming wedding, and my son smiling consistently again. I really appreciate all of you wonderful people and all of your good advice and well-wishing. Life is so much easier now, babies require time but they are drama free!

#----NEW UPDATE----

[She is someone else's problem!](https://www.reddit.com/u/GreatestThrow-man/s/OyTqj6EKuH): **June 17, 2025 (one month later from the last update)**

This will probably be my last one of these because everything is normal and good again. My daughter's wedding is pretty well planned, it is going to be relaxed and small, 40-50 people, my daughter is so happy with the location and how it is going, it makes me so happy. Seeing her so happy, this is the best feeling and exactly what a wedding should be. Plus my daughter has really taken to my wife helping plan it, she has a good eye for design, and it has given her something to focus on that is not our little one. Her partner joined me on an overnight fishing trip recently, we got to drink and bond, she told me that she wanted me to walk her down the aisle too. I told her I already agreed to, she was checking that my yes was sincere and not just to be nice. I told her our family is better because of her joining it and that I was deeply honored that she wanted me to. We hugged and drank and talked about how wonderful my daughter is; it really is a feeling of peace to see your child with someone who is great and who respects as well as cares for them. I know they have discussed adoption eventually, they would be wonderful parents, and my son would be a great uncle.

That was my smooth transition to my son. He is doing well, he is dating a woman he met at my synagogue at a singles event. She seems very sweet, she teaches in the Hebrew school and they have gone out a few times. I am just happy he seems his old self, like before Abbie.

So to Abbie...she is engaged and someone else's problem! My son still has some friends in common with her and someone let him know. He did not want any details but my daughter, to no one's surprise, went online (fake account) onto social media. I came home one day to her and my wife going through her pictures and posts. They have been in love for 150 years, it is the truest love of all loves, thatsince the invention of the kiss there have been 5 kisses rated the most passionate, the most pure, and that they left them all behind. The guy looks like an older and balder version of my son, to the point that when my daughter showed him to me she said ""look, John really let himself go."" I tapped out of looking at more, but I can tell you that her pictures have several of her with the guy's father, and yes they have captions about her dad. May G-d have mercy on his soul. I feel like the guy from the beginning of It Follows, foisting her on a different father to save myself and my family, but what can I say, we did not have to outrun Abbie, just outrun a different father.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** What a happy ending to this saga. And BeSha'a Tova to you all! Also loved the Princess Bride reference...

> **OOP:** I am happy that people know the reference, I still love that movie

**OOP on giving a post-wedding update**

> **OOP:** I have had a couple people ask about that, I had not planned on it, but people here have been so great that I will try to remember to. The planning has been so much fun, my wife and I have been invited to be a part of the planning, more than I expected. It has been great for my wife, who is kind of playing mother of a bride and my daughter is having fun with it. For obvious reasons my daughter has never thought of my wife as a mother-type, but I think not having her mom involved in the wedding has made her open to my wife in a new way. She dress and suit shopped with her, they have been doing a lot together. Obviously my wife lets her take the lead and does not push that, but she loves it and I do too. Truly I am so blessed.

**Commenter 2:** Woohoo!!! After a hard day at work this is the update I needed!! Thank you sir! Now.... we may be done with Abbie, however, we're INVESTED.... you've made your family or family we feel like we know them. We want to know how the baby is doing, how the wedding goes, how beautiful the girls look, and how John gets on with this new girl. We may not need updates daily, but maybe every so often wouldn't hurt 😊

> **OOP:** That is very nice of you to say, honestly I was not going to bother with more but so many people have mentioned a post-wedding update that I feel I should after how helpful people have been. Our little man is great. I did not miss teething. I did miss baby laugh. My wife is good, there were some physical side effects from the birth but she worked with her team and is fine now, actually she is incredibly happy. Wedding planning continues unabated. An amazing thing has happened. My daughter, who has been honest about it hurting she does not have a mom who could be there, has started getting closer to my wife. They never had a mother/daughter aspect to their relationship, not surprisingly, but have always gotten along. But my wife's excited offers to help with ideas was met positively, and when Sally went looking at dresses or suits to wear she asked my wife to attend. She played it cool but cried for joy that night. They have been getting closer. Then we saw my daughter's wedding breakdown and it said Father of a Bride by my name, and Stepmother of a Bride by my wife's name- Sally has always referred to her as ""my dad's wife"" never stepmother. More happy tears. This was an unexpected bonus. I hope you are having good things in your life as well, we could all just use some calm times with good people.

1ls0x69,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1ls0x69/can_you_make_cold_brew_with_instant_coffee/,Can you make cold brew with instant coffee?,"As a coffee lover, I've often wondered if it's possible to make cold brew with instant coffee. After experimenting and researching, I've found some interesting answers to this question.

First off, let's clarify what cold brew coffee actually is. Cold brew is made by steeping coarse ground coffee in cold water for 12-24 hours. This process creates a smooth, less acidic coffee concentrate that can be served over ice or mixed with milk.

Now, can you use instant coffee for this? The short answer is yes, but with some caveats. Instant coffee is already brewed and dehydrated, so it dissolves quickly in water. This means you won't get the same slow extraction process that makes cold brew unique.

However, if you're in a pinch or don't have access to whole beans, you can make a cold brew-style drink with instant coffee. Here's a simple method:

1. Mix 1-2 tablespoons of instant coffee with 1 cup of cold water.
2. Stir well and let it sit in the fridge for 4-6 hours.
3. Strain if needed (though instant coffee usually dissolves completely).
4. Serve over ice and add milk or water to taste.

The result won't be exactly like traditional cold brew, but it can be a refreshing alternative. Keep in mind that the flavor might be more bitter or intense than regular cold brew.

If you're serious about making great iced coffee at home, I'd recommend investing in a proper cold brew maker. These devices make the process much easier and produce consistently good results. I've found some excellent options at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They have a range of cold brew makers that can suit different needs and budgets.

While instant coffee can work in a pinch, using freshly ground coffee beans will always give you a better flavor. Cold brew makers are designed to extract the best flavors from coffee beans over time, resulting in a smoother, less acidic drink.

For those who enjoy iced coffee regularly, a dedicated cold brew maker can be a game-changer. It allows you to make large batches of coffee concentrate that can last for up to two weeks in the fridge. This means you can have delicious iced coffee ready to go whenever you want it.

If you're interested in exploring some great cold brew maker options, check out the selection at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They've got everything from simple pitcher-style brewers to more advanced systems.

In conclusion, while you can make a cold brew-style drink with instant coffee, it won't give you the same results as using whole beans in a proper cold brew maker.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a router circle jig frequently enough hinges on a few key features that define its usability, accuracy, and durability. Careful consideration of these features ensures you're investing in a tool that will meet the demands of your woodworking projects for years to come.

**Material and Build Quality:** The material and build quality of a router circle jig are paramount for achieving consistent and precise cuts. A robust jig should be constructed from durable materials such as high-grade aluminum or phenolic.

Aluminum jigs offer excellent rigidity and are resistant to corrosion, ensuring long-term reliability. Phenolic jigs, on the other hand, are known for their lightweight nature and ability to dampen vibrations, resulting in smoother cuts.The thickness of the material is also critical; a thicker jig will provide greater stability and minimize flexing during operation, which directly contributes to accuracy. Look for jigs with precisely machined components and smooth edges to prevent snags and ensure effortless router movement.

**Adjustability and Range:** A versatile router circle jig should offer a wide range of adjustability to accommodate various circle sizes. Check the jig's specified cutting range, which typically indicates the minimum and maximum diameter of circles it can produce.

A larger cutting range provides greater adaptability for tackling diverse projects. The adjustment mechanism should be smooth and precise, allowing you to fine-tune the circle diameter with ease. look for jigs that feature clear and easy-to-read measurement scales, preferably in both inches and millimeters, to ensure accurate adjustments. Some advanced jigs incorporate micro-adjustment features, enabling even finer control over the circle size.

**compatibility with Routers:** Ensuring compatibility with your router is a crucial step when selecting a router circle jig. Most jigs come with a global mounting plate that is designed to accommodate a wide range of router models.

However, it's still essential to verify that your specific router's base dimensions and hole patterns align with the mounting plate. Some jigs may require drilling additional holes in the mounting plate to fit your router, which can be a tedious and potentially error-prone process. It's also worth considering jigs with pre-drilled holes for popular router models, which can save you time and effort during installation. Additionally, evaluate the jig's mounting mechanism; a secure and stable router attachment is essential for preventing slippage and ensuring consistent cuts.

**Pivot System and Stability:** The pivot system of a router circle jig plays a vital role in determining the accuracy and smoothness of circle cuts. A robust pivot system should consist of a sturdy center pin that securely anchors the jig to the workpiece.

the pivot pin should be made from hardened steel to resist bending and wear,ensuring long-term durability. Ideally, the jig should offer multiple pivot point options, allowing you to adjust the pivot position based on the circle size and workpiece thickness. Some jigs feature a bearing-guided pivot system, which minimizes friction and provides exceptionally smooth rotation. The base of the jig should also be designed to provide maximum stability on the workpiece, preventing unwanted movement or vibration during cutting.

**Dust Collection Capabilities:** In woodworking, dust management is not just about cleanliness; it's crucial for safety and visibility. A router circle jig equipped with an effective dust collection system can substantially improve your working environment.

Look for jigs that feature a dust port that can be connected to a shop vacuum or dust collector. The dust port should be strategically positioned to capture dust and debris as it's generated during cutting. some jigs also incorporate internal dust channels that direct airflow towards the dust port, maximizing dust collection efficiency. Efficient dust collection improves visibility, reduces the risk of respiratory irritation, and helps to maintain a cleaner and safer workshop.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality router circle jig offers several significant benefits that can enhance your woodworking projects and streamline your workflow.

**Unmatched Precision:** Router circle jigs offer exceptional precision when cutting circles and arcs. Using a jig eliminates the guesswork and potential errors associated with freehand cutting, ensuring that your circles are perfectly round and consistent.

This precision is particularly crucial for projects that demand accurate dimensions and tight-fitting joints, such as speaker boxes, tabletops, and architectural models. The ability to create perfectly symmetrical circles with a router circle jig significantly elevates the quality and craftsmanship of your woodworking projects.

**Enhanced Efficiency:** A router circle jig dramatically increases the speed and efficiency of cutting circles compared to traditional methods. Setting up the jig is swift and straightforward, allowing you to repeatedly cut identical circles with minimal effort.

This increased efficiency is particularly valuable for production runs or projects that involve multiple circles of the same size. The precise and repeatable nature of circle jig cutting saves you time and reduces the risk of errors, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your woodworking project.

**Versatile Applications:** Router circle jigs are incredibly versatile tools that can be used for a wide range of woodworking applications. From cutting circular tabletops and speaker baffles to creating decorative inlays and curved moldings, the possibilities are endless.

The ability to adjust the circle diameter allows you to tackle diverse projects with varying size requirements. Moreover, router circle jigs can be used with a variety of router bits, enabling you to create circles with different edge profiles and decorative details. This versatility makes a router circle jig an indispensable tool for any woodworker looking to expand their creative horizons.

**Improved Safety:** Using a router circle jig enhances safety during circle cutting by providing a stable and controlled platform for the router. The jig eliminates the need to freehand the router, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries.

The secure attachment of the router to the jig prevents slippage and ensures that the router remains on the intended cutting path. Additionally, the jig provides a clear visual reference for the cutting operation, allowing you to maintain focus and avoid distractions.

## FAQs Section

addressing common questions helps potential buyers understand the tool better.**Can I use any router with a router circle jig?**
While most router circle jigs are designed with universal compatibility in mind, it's crucial to verify that your specific router model is compatible. Check the jig's specifications for compatibility details, paying attention to the base diameter and hole patterns of your router. In some cases, you may need to drill additional holes in the jig's mounting plate to accommodate your router.

**what materials are best suited for use with a router circle jig?**
Router circle jigs are versatile tools that can be used with a wide range of materials, including hardwoods, softwoods, plywood, MDF, and acrylics. The choice of material will depend on the specific requirements of your project. When working with harder materials, it's essential to use sharp router bits and take multiple shallow passes to avoid excessive strain on the router and jig.

**How do I ensure accurate circle cuts with a router circle jig?**
Ensuring accurate circle cuts requires careful setup and attention to detail. First, make sure the jig is securely attached to the workpiece and that the pivot pin is firmly anchored in place. Double-check the circle diameter to ensure it matches the desired dimensions. Use a sharp router bit and take multiple shallow passes to minimize tear-out and ensure a smooth cut. Maintain a consistent feed rate and avoid applying excessive pressure to the router.

Okey this happened in the end of 2022/early 2023, I'm currently 18f, for some context my mom and my dad are separated, they have my older sister and 4 years later they have me but for this time my mom hate him (he was/is a alcoholic) and was a really toxic relationship for some reason they continue a couple of years till my mom finally kick him out of the house. 
It was for the best really and my sister and I continue to see our dad and I can said he love us very much, but I think this touch something in my sister head, the separation and my existence of course, because she was the first grandchild of bout families, my mom and dad are the older child from their families, and she was incredibly spoiled because of that, till I born and ""robbed"" the attention. 
She and I grow up fight very much, verbally and physically, she never forgive me for being born, but we started get along when our mom started dating to our stepfather, he was good in the beginning, I accept that I was considering see him like a dad, but then he became a alcoholic like my dad but him and my mom are together till this day. We both hated him, he has never been physically abuse of any kind to my mom or us, but yes verbally and is EXTREMELY controlling and when he is drunk the house is uncomfortable, fights, smell of the alcohol or vomit, just see him pass out in the couch, is horrible.
He and my mom married and have our little brother in 2014, he is the only good thing of that relationship, me and my sister and I love him. 
My sister became a extremely weird person, she has this necessity to always be the center of everything, she really try to be a influencer, and always lied to everyone about things just to have attention, if you are in a discussion with her and she is losing she are going to yelling, literally yelling crazy and trying to scratch you with her long nails, she is a petite-otaku-vegan-crazy person. 
She always said that our mom doesn't love her because she don't buy vegan meat and more things for her, I don't know in other countries but in mine vegan meat is VERY expensive, my mom is a teacher and here paid very little to teachers, father is a chef but almost always is unemployed, stepfather has a little store, so we really don't have much money, my mom is currently still paying the house we live, so yes she always was a little crazy self-center person. 
I was worst when she started to being obsessed with criminals TV shows (CSI, Criminals Minds, etc) and it was always listening to podcasts or YouTube videos about true crimes cases and when she graduated for college started studying criminology. I remember perfectly one time that she told me that they not just teach to how cach criminals, also teach how do the ""perfect crime"". She in the las years of college started dating one guy, her boyfriend became a really good friend of mine but was obsessed with her, that increase her ego even more, one time our coffee machine broke so our mom made coffee in a traditional way, put hot water in the coffe with filter paper, literally the same that does the machine, it was coffe, but no, she was not drinking that coffe, she made her boyfriend came to our house with a termo with coffe from a machine. 
In any discussion that they have she shut up him, she always need to have the reason and him literally just gave her all the things she wanted, if i said something and he agreed to me but my sister no he literally tell her that was sorry and then said that he changed opinion, again, it was creppy. 
In 2021/2022 she and I became best friends, thanks to Covid, we was always together, she have a boyfriend but cero friends, I have literally one friend and her, so for me was my best friend, but for November my stepfather was drunk, it was a huge deal and a very horrible time, but happened something, he was really, really sick, he vomited, and vomited, more that normal, almost died. 
He don't die, in January was fine, my mom already forgive him, and everything, in a close ""city"" ""place"" I don't know how explaining doesn't matters, there were some celebrations that take place every year, our father, one of his sister and our paternal grandmother takes us to visit that celebrations, in the night we slept in my father house with them, but the next day my sister went there again but with her boyfriend. The next thing I know is that my mother is texting me tell me that my sister is in a psychiatric center, because in a game she loses all the money that she had to pay for some things at university and she call my mom for more, then loses all that money too, she has a psychotic attack and the police don't know what to do with that thing so they leve her in the psychiatric, the boyfriend calls my mom, so she go there. 
There they do a exam in my sister and a interrogation, she tells huge lies, for example that we were physically abuse or that I try to unal1ve myself (spoiler later thanks to her I do star thinking that) but the most important thing is that she confess that she put cockroach poison in my stepfather beer and put a combination of pills that she maid dust on the container were was the lemon juice that my mom and I drink. I do remember one time that I grip the container because I want a drink and she look at me and said ""Are your sure? It taste bad"" I really don't give much attention and drink any way I FRONT OF HER and it taste weird, but in the moment just I think it was the refrigerator that gave that taste. 
When my mom read all the things she said a and do in the document when they let her out (YES THEY HEAR ALL THE THINGS SHE DID AND LET HER OUT THE SAME DAY, LIKE LITERALLY JUST CONFESSED TO TRY TO KILL THREE PEOPLE, INCLUDING HER MOM AND SISTER!????) she almost pass out, I don't know how they make it to the house, but the next day my grandma took me to the house and I talk to my mom, she obviously is a disaster, then she and my stepfather go I don't remember where o why, but I was alone with her. 
I was in a huge shock, but try to talk to her, she was acting so arrogant, I never going to forget how she see me in the eyes and said ""I do nothing wrong"", then she go to her room, she is really, really small, i am like a head and half more tall than her and much more strong, we bot get bullied in school but when she just internalise all that I was fighting verbally and physically with everybody, if she don't go and keep tell me things I was really thinking about to beat her I sincerely wish that would happened for all the things that happen later. 
My paternal grandmother come and try to speak with her, we all sit in the living room, except for my stepfather, and talk she just repeat thar she do nothing wrong and laughing, she was LAUGHING, my grandmother tells her what about her boyfriend and career she just said that her boyfriend would never leave her, I sincerely think that if he try she would k1ll him. 
That night i slept in my fathers house again, he was also in a huge shock, the next day my sister was gone, she run out of the house because my mom was trying to get her moving in to my father's place. In the present she said that my mother kicked her out, she end it in a apartment that was paid for my maternal grandmother, she was in her side, she was defending her and tell us that she was no trying to k1ll us she just wanna that us ""calm down"". 
Then she sue my mom for child support, here if a child is not living with the parents, one or both must paid child support till they have 22 years or the child no longer keep studying or they moving it with a partner, so we start with a legal battle, but again, with have no much money, no just I started thinking about ended up and just give up on live, my mother too. In the end she lose and started paying child support every month to her, that put us in a really hard time economically.
My mom packed all her things and her Boyfriends come for them, and my maternal grandma stard to tell me that a was being a bad sister because I don't wanna talk to her. 
She ended up living in my grandma house, my mother started to forgive her and let my little brother go with her, him seems to love her for some reason, she don't talk to much to my mom, she keep saying that my mom is horrible and never loved her, and she is the problem that deserves everything, bla, bla, but my mom really wanna have a relationship with her. 

She is a totall asshole, crazy shit person, and I really, really hated her, I wanna insult her more but the insults in English are boring with no much meaning compared to insults in Spanish. In the present she is living with her husband, yes they married, my mom not pay child support anymore, but is not fair, everybody forgive her, my brother love go to her place, my aunt, sister of my mom, is close to her, she is the mom of my cousin he has my same age and with are very close but she always see me weird, my grandma loves her, she work, keep studying, my mom trying to talk to her, went to the wedding, everybody does what she want, she love eat chess but that gave her strong digestive problems, literally her shit is like a rock, when she was living with my granma the toilet was not capable of ""suck off"" that rock, and she just leves my grandma go every time with a stick to turn the rock in to small peaces so the toilet will work. 

It's not fair that she literally have cero consequences, everybody loves her, my maternal grandfather have money but he lives far away with the woman that he leaves my grandma for, he takes my sister to vacations, and every loves her, she literally have a TikTok (but have like 5 followers) there she talks about how she ran away from a toxic family and mother, she talks like she was a poor victim, a angel that was being abused, obviously she not talk about de abuse of she to me (she loves making me bullying for my body, and in my birthdays always try to make me feel miserable) and don't talk about all the trying to k1ll my family things, in her wedding, I don't go but I see pictures, she was in a princess dress with a tiara, honestly she was ugly, and when she was starting to work she post a Instagram history with a picture of her and a text that said ""Is so hard this work, it's like putting Paris Hilton to work"". 

I wish I just could forget that she is my sister, that I have a older sister in general, that when for year a complete focused to be there to my mom and playing, caring and everything to my little brother, they just love and prefer her, my mother really try to have a relationship and my brother loves to be with, play and be in her place, is obviously that she is her favorite sister. But is no just that, my mother always is telling me that a I am a ""close mind"" because I don't forgive, I don't want a relationship with her and I literally don't talk to my stepfather, we live together but I act like him don't exists, I love my maternal grandmother, but she keeps telling me that I am the bad sister because I don't want to talk to her, even been near her, she is telling me that we are always gonna be blood connect (I feel sick for that), that I am a bad person, I'm gonna go to hell (I'm gonna see her and my stepfather there so I want to be happy without them in this live) etc, my maternal grandfather is also telling me that I'm gonna forgive her I a point of my life, and that a I need to talk to her and stop being a bad sister, my aunt thinks that I am the weird and toxic one even with my boyfriend, etc, it's 2025 and I'm still being call the bad sister and she is in a happy live with no consequences.

Book 1: Prologue

Nikki \*



I was determined to avoid meeting him tonight. No matter what.



I’d never been so glammed up, sugar high, and slightly irritated. I sit in the waiting room surrounded by my friends and Brodie's family. The hospital staff goes in and out through the operating room doors. We all look in that direction with hopes that it may be news awaiting us—an update on what happened after Brodie was rushed into the OR. Another patient is being moved down the hall on a hospital bed, an IV bag of fluids dripping in sync with the beeping monitor as he passes by.



Every sound seems to be intensified, every smell much more potent. Alex is by my side. His thumb rubs circles in a continuous soothing manner on the top of my hand. The rhythmic motion settles me as the callous weight of his fingers offers me the stability my hand needs not to shake. The fact that he hasn't left my side speaks volumes about his character. The way he handled the situation at the beach. The authoritarian personality and calm with which he controlled the situation—the accident. If I weren't so shell-shocked, I would have been turned on witnessing him perform in such a manner. If it had not been Brodie there on the wet sand, limp and unconscious. If a million things were different.



Brodie's parents are here. It's a stressful time for all of us without dealing with the awkwardness of this parent's divorce and the bitterness between the two parties. His dad must have flown on the interstate to get here in that record time. Everyone sits in silence, waiting to hear the outcome of Brodie's surgery. Finally, in what seems like an eternity, a man wearing blue scrubs accompanied by a female in similar attire exits the operating room doors and asks for the family of Brodie. His parents stand and walk down the hall within view to receive the much-awaited results of the surgery. It's as if time stands still, and you can hear a pin drop. Except for the steps on the freshly waxed, tiled floor, no other sound exists.



The surgeon speaks, and then his mom raises her hands to her mouth, and a sob escapes, relinquishing a terrible cry of her pain. Brodie's dad just shakes his hands around, asking spitfire questions, not allowing a moment to pause for an answer. The surgeon just shakes his head in acknowledgment. His dad puts his hands up to his eyes and lowers his head. The surgeon touches his shoulder and says something to them before walking back to our group. I rise from my chair as though I am being pulled toward this invisible force.



As I stand, the surgeon stops at our group and says, ""Is there a Nikki here?""



I look at him, stunned and unable to speak. I feel a nudge from my side.



The surgeon begins to speak, and I don't hear what he says. He repeats, ""Brodie is awake and was asking for you specifically. He wants to see you.""



I gasped. A breath let out that I didn't realize I was holding as it rushed out. I feel Alex bring my hand to his lips and gently kiss them. The heat of his mouth makes me shudder. He releases my hand without saying a word, telling me to go. I walk away, following the doctor without looking back. I know he won't be there when I return to the waiting room, and that this is goodbye.



Book 1: Chapter One

Nikki



Something about driving with the windows down while cruising over the causeway makes me smile. The second I lower the window, the familiar scent of saltwater washes through the car. The beach has always been my happy place, and l was damn lucky to find an apartment and job so close to it. While I make my way down the highway toward work, I steal glances at the view. The waves, the people sunning themselves on the beach, the surfers in the water, and even the seagulls squawking overhead make me smile. I drink it all in for a moment... that is until the hot as fuck blast of steam assaults my face and I'm ripped back to reality.



God, it's hot as Hades today. I pull at my shirt as the sweat trickles down into my cleavage. I turn off on the next exit ramp and pull into the employee parking lot of the Bayside Hospital Emergency Department.



""Great,"" I mutter to myself. Quickly looking around, I see multiple ambulances parked in the designated bays. It's going to be a busy night. ""What else is new?"" I breathe out in a long, exaggerated sigh.



This is the norm for the start of any weekend, but this isn't just any weekend. It's spring break on Padre Island—guaranteed to supply an endless amount of ER visits from sun-induced dehydration to broken bones to college kids who have one (or five) too many beers. Lucky me.



With my work bag slung over my shoulder and iced coffee in hand, I make my way to the front doors. I say a silent prayer and hope that if I hide my badge and don't make eye contact, then no one will stop and ask me anything. This is my reasoning, at least, to not be bothered with a million questions before I start my shift. I walk past the triage desk in the emergency room and subtly scan the packed waiting room. It's already filled with patients. I head to my locker, throw my bag in and make a spot for my lunch in the fridge, gently squishing it into a packed space. Geez, I hope my leftovers from dinner last night don't fall out because that would royally suck. I had blackened catfish the previous night, and I plan on reheating it later. Nothing worse than stinky fish in the lunchroom, I chuckle to myself. Besides, there are worse smells in this place.



I keep a firm hold on my iced coffee as I leave the break room. I wish I could shoot this stuff straight into my circulatory system to get one immediate, gratifying caffeine rush. Lord knows I need it this evening. I blame the grounds crew mowing at my apartment complex for my lack of energy today. I know they have to cut the grass, but it seriously kept me from my usual death-like sleep. Working the night shift can be challenging. They must have mowed the grass for at least four hours. Not even the white noise produced by my oscillating fan could get the job done.



Although I'd like to blame it all on that, it isn't the real reason I had shit for sleep. I am sure I would have tossed and turned despite the incessant noise outside my window. I've had a ton of crap on my mind lately, precisely the unpleasant subject of my current boyfriend, Brodie. Being in a perpetual state of limbo with this guy is just dragging me down. Our relationship status is something we decided to chat about this weekend. It shouldn't be this hard. We've known each other practically our whole Nikkies. Before I go too far down that rabbit hole, I shove these thoughts to the back of my mind.



First things first, I just have to get through this shift. I walk to the nurses' station, take one last swig of my highly caffeinated drink, and reluctantly place it in the cubby. It sits among countless other beverages taking up residency there, condensation pooling all around the surface. The assignment board is already updated. I scan it quickly and begin my hunt for Emma. I need to get a report on her patients so she can get out of this place. At least one person will be having fun tonight. Why did I sign up for this shift? Oh yeah, I need the money.



I shift my gaze down one of the corridors and spot who I'm looking for. Blond hair piled on top of her head in a messy bun, Emma is not only a nurse that I happen to be relieving at shift change but also one of my best friends. As high energy as ever, I can hear her excitedly babbling to one of our attendings. Her hand gestures raised above her head are so fast that I think she may accidentally smack him in the face. There's a reason people refer to her as the energizer bunny. We both took the sign-on bonus offered at the hospital after our nursing school graduation a couple of years ago. She took a job on the twelve-hour day shift while I decided to take the opposite twelve-hour night shift. My decision to take the less desirable shift allowed me to enroll in classes for my bachelor's degree. Classes during the day, work at night. Grueling schedule for sure, but it's getting me where I want to be, so I'm sucking it up and embracing the chaos. My social life has taken a hit between school and work, but I'll graduate with my BSN in a couple of months and then continue to Houston, where I've been accepted into nurse practitioner school. Soon I'll be leaving this town and on to bigger and better things. Emma catches my eye, and I nod to let her know I'm here.



As I walk toward her, she flashes me a huge smile. ""Thank God you're here. It's been hell today.""



I can't help but stifle a laugh. ""You say that every shift.""



She carefully counts the narcotics remaining in the bin and enters the correct count before closing it. ""I only say it because it's true."" She giggles. ""I hope your night is better, but looking at the stack of pending charts..."" she trails off and gives me a sympathetic frown. Ready to brave the shift, I chuckle and head toward the nurse's station.



""Judging by the waiting room, I think I'm forever and eternity fucked tonight. Let's hope nothing memorable happens."" Emma gently squeezes my shoulder before shoving some charts into my hands.



""Come on, Nikki, I'll give you a report on my patients. Room ten has some pain meds ordered, and I'll give her those before I leave. Can you reassess her pain in a bit?""



Thank goodness for Emma. The woman looked very uncomfortable when I peeked in as we passed her room. I do not want her to wait for her pain medication until after our shift change. ""I'll be back in a few minutes to give you a report on the rest of my patients. The sooner I do, the sooner I can get my drink on tonight."" With that, she turns on her heels and prances down the hall.



Ten minutes later, she popped back up by my elbow. I'm only half-listening as she gives me the sign-out on her patients. ""The labs on the patient in room eight just came back, and room two is..."" She can tell by the look on my face that I'm in no mood for work. ""You know we're all going to miss you tonight, right? It's the first time in a long while that we've all been able to get together."" I didn't need the reminder. The fact that I was missing out on tonight was a bit of a sore spot. Our mutual high school friends are returning again for the continuous spring break beach party. The days at the beach, sea sculptures, and Nikkie entertainment are just some things that happen on the island during this carnivalesque time.



""You have no idea how jealous I am right now, Em?"" She makes a melodramatic pouty face while holding both arms out for a hug.



I give her a quick squeeze feeling utterly deflated. For a second, I consider telling my manager I'm not feeling well so I can go home. But my stupid conscience won't allow it. I will only call out from my shift if I'm dead or dealing with some other near-death experience. I'm not sure even that wouldn't require a call-out. As tired (and jealous) as I am, missing work is not an option. I need every penny for graduate school; the move to Houston won't be cheap.



""I'll see them tomorrow, Em. Actually, in less than twenty-four hours, you know that."" As positive as I try to sound on the outside, I'm internally cursing this shift. ""Well, I want lots of pics tonight to make me feel like I am there with you guys.""



""Of course,"" Emma quickly replies. ""You know we will. I expect to meet up with the whole gang later tonight, and I will send pics of that. You better go straight to bed after your shift and get the best four hours of sleep because I am picking your ass up by noon, got it?""



I laugh. ""I expect a large iced coffee and preferably a greasy breakfast burrito.""



She laughs as she grabs her bags and heads toward the door. ""Naturally, only the breakfast of champions for my bestie,"" she says over her shoulder. ""I'll see you tomorrow!""



And with that, she grabs her purse and giant water bottle and heads for the door. I shuffle my feet in dramatic flair. Yup, I am definitely not ready for this shift.



As soon as she leaves, I spot Dr. Hall, the handsome thirty-eight-year-old ER physician with a reputation for flirting with the staff.



""Hi, Dr. Hall.""



""Hey, Nikki. Glad you're on tonight."" He throws me a wink.



Typically that little gesture would have perked me up, but even that doesn't help my mood. ""Thanks,"" I blurted out. ""I've got some updates, the labs are back on the patient in room eight, and the completed chart for review is queued first in line when you get a chance.""



I am met with kind but tired eyes, almost reflecting my own. ""Great,"" he mutters as he quickly goes to retrieve the chart.



I check on my other patients and quickly chart and update vital signs. Dr. Hall comes over and informs me that he printed out the discharge instruction for bay eight, and they can go. At least someone is getting out of here quickly tonight.



I gather all the instructions and check to see if she needs anything else before making my way over there. The drape is still closed, so I call out her name before I peek in.



Mrs. Shea replies, ""Just a minute, dear. I am just pulling on my shirt.""



I waited patiently for her to finish and helped her to the waiting room. As I pass the discharge instructions to her, we see her husband pulling up in front of the entrance. As I watch her drive away, I can't help but think about what the next patient will bring.



I let the ED tech know that the bay was empty so they could clean up the room and prepare it for the next patient. Our department is certainly busy, but thank goodness it's efficient. I grab the following chart in cue and look at the chief complaint—ankle pain—related to a surfing injury.



""Well, that's a total surprise,"" I mutter as I make my way to the waiting room.



I open the door to the waiting room and call out, ""Alex Johnson?""



No reply. I see two guys sitting in the chairs wearing board shorts, T-shirts, and flip-flops, chatting animatedly with each other. When they get up, I bet there will be sand all over the seats too. A quick scan of them shows one has a bruised and swollen ankle. That has to be him. But as my eyes wander up from the ankle in question, I notice the rest of him. I feel myself start to zone out a bit as they continue their conversation, and my eyes drift from his ankle, up to his legs and over his lean body. He must be the most attractive man I have ever seen. Around six foot four inches, toned, tan, and totally delicious. His long muscular legs are streaked with blond hair. His T-shirt is tight against his chest and shows off his narrow waist. His shorts sit low on his hips, just low enough that I catch the shadow of a V pointing straight to where I'm trying not to look.



I realize both are still obNikkiious to my announcement and the fact that I've been so blatantly staring at them now. I look away as cheeks begin to heat. I notice a couple of patients smirking at my lack of subtlety. I give myself a mental slap and call the name again.



""Alex Johnson?"" My voice comes out an octave too high, and I pray they overlooked that too. I see the pair halt their conversation, and one raises his arm.



""That's me, coming."" His deep voice pierces right through me and sends a wave of butterflies straight into my stomach. He tries to get up but stumbles almost immediately, trying to avoid putting weight on his ankle.



I go to grab a wheelchair just in case he needs it. When I return, I see he's made his way across the waiting room—holding on to his friend's arm for support. It's then I notice his arms. Thick muscular arms with every nurse's dream of pipe veins running up his forearms. If a forearm porn show were a thing, he would be the star. I lift my vision to his face and catch him staring at me with amusement.



Was I that obvious? My face immediately flushed with embarrassment, and it became about a hundred degrees too hot in the room. My blood seems to have been rerouted and is collecting in my now scorching face. Taking a deep breath, I try to regain an ounce of professionalism and look up. I instantly met with the most exquisite pair of penetrating blue eyes. Wow, is there anything wrong with him? Oh yeah, his ankle. He stares at me with such intensity that I feel he can almost read my thoughts as his gaze also shoots to his ankle. I immediately looked away in embarrassment because he knew what I was thinking.



""Do you need a wheelchair?"" I state in the most squeaky-sounding voice I have ever heard myself make to further my humiliation.



He looks at the wheelchair and then back at me. A smile was displayed on his face. As if he couldn't make me feel any giddier, a dimple appears on his left cheek, and I feel a slight warmth spread between my legs.



I try to move forward but feel my feet locked in place. It's like my shoes are cemented to the waiting room floor. Damn, could I be any more pathetic?



I clear my throat and try again, ""Do you need a wheelchair?""



He shakes his head, and I feel his unwavering stare, but I do not make eye contact this time. ""No thanks, I can walk,"" he says while grabbing on to his friend's arm for support.



I go to put the wheelchair back and hit the button for the automatic door.



He begins to walk, and I hear him say, ""This might take me a minute.""



I reply over my shoulder without turning my head, ""That's fine. You can take your time with me. I mean, umm, no need to rush."" I immediately rush around the corner and smack my forehead. Someone just shoot me now and end my word vomit. ""We don't have far to go,"" I add. ""Just around the corner.""



We make it to the empty bay, and I notice that his friend hasn't returned with him. I grab a hospital gown from the cabinet and hand it to him. As he reaches out for the gown, his fingers brush my palm. The touch is soft but electric. The zap immediately shoots through my hand into my body, making me tingle all over. Jerking my hand away and wondering if he felt that too, I took a step back to close the curtain to give him privacy. But let's be honest: I just needed some space to pull myself together.

His parents are good people and he had a heart of gold. But back then they were a lot different. They were a bit poor. (I was barely middle class.) The dad was his stepdad and there were 4 kids all together. Him and his sister from the mom and two younger brothers from mom and stepdad. The younger brothers would literally sleep wherever they dropped.

The house was always filthy. I mean mountains of dirty clothes everywhere, everything covered in a film, and the parents both smoked pretty much non stop. So it smelled like smoke.

I'd never want to eat there. I did maybe once when his dad cooked a big pot of spaghetti and they went on about how it was the best and I just couldn't weasel my way out.

In the morning, my friend would literally find a random bowl in the house, rinse it with nothing but water. find a random spoon on like the coffee table, rinse it with water, then eat a fat bowl of cereal. Then hi

I had really bad anxiety as a kid and was really bad with ""confrontation"". I didn't really know what to do so I always found some way to not eat. One time someone made me a sandwich on the kitchen cabinet that had ash and a film of grime on it. I was maybe 9 or 10. I went to a far back bedroom and just put it in a desk drawer.

Anyways, a little about me: 33, I live in 2 places in the United States. I work on Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones. I work in 2 places; I’m busy and very intense. I don’t have lots of time for nonsense, but I consider myself a fair and kind person.

Here's a bit about myself: I genuinely seek the positive in people, yet I also rely on my intuition. While I have a solid circle of friends, most are married with children, which makes it difficult for us to spend time together. I fully respect their commitments, but it feels like our life paths are diverging right now. Therefore, I'm not looking to connect with married friends at this time; I’m open to friendships with those who are divorced, but I want to steer clear of any drama involving ex-partners—life's too short for that. 

As for me, I’m 33 years old and split my time between two locations in the United States. My work spans both Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones, and I juggle responsibilities at two different jobs. I'm busy and focused, leaving little room for nonsense.

As a passionate reader and a devoted audiobooks enthusiast, I find immense joy in immersing myself in stories, especially while traveling. Listening to books is a practical way for me to indulge in literature, and there's something truly magical about the experience of being read to! I often crank up the speed to double time, so if you're up for a discussion about books, I’d absolutely love that. Recently, I was deeply moved by ""The River is Waiting"" by Wally Lamb; though it was a poignant read, it left a lasting impression on my heart and shifted my perspective on significant topics. That's the beauty of books for me!

Music truly means a lot to me. Right now, I'm putting together a dinner playlist that is coming together beautifully, featuring artists such as Kacey Musgraves and Ella Fitzgerald. I actually have a 20-hour playlist that includes a wide variety of genres. I recently stumbled upon the band “The Scarlet Opera,” and I'm really enjoying their sound. I have Apple Music, so if you're interested in checking out my playlists, that would be great!

I have a deep appreciation for theater, ballet, and opera. There's something truly enchanting about dressing up to enjoy these remarkable performances. However, I'm equally fond of TV and movies. While getting dressed for an night on a town  is enjoyable, I also cherish the comfort of donning sweatpants and a concert t-shirt while staying in.

I have a passion for dining out and discovering new restaurants. Although I enjoy cooking at home, I've recently found myself in a phase where exploring brunch and dinner venues with friends is my main focus. I’m a huge fan of iced coffee and love to share ample amounts of champagne with great company! Brunch, lunch, and food in general are all favorites of mine!



I've traveled extensively, from Bali to Paris to Kenya, and I've explored all 50 states. At this point, it feels like I've ticked off most of the destinations on my wishlist. However, if you mention any city, I can definitely provide you with some fantastic restaurant suggestions!   
Here are a  fun fact about me :During my college summers, I spent time working in Florida, where I had a job that involved a certain famous mouse. Any guesses on what I did?

I just finished watching the first episode of The Pitt and absolutely loved it! However, I'm watching it with my mom, and she texted me saying she can only handle one episode a night. Ugh!

I'm searching for someone between the ages of 26 and 50 who resides in the United States and has a preference for voting blue, just like I do. I’m not particularly interested in sports or video games, so if those are your main sources of entertainment, we may not be a good fit. Additionally, I'm not a fan of hiking or camping, so please keep that in mind!

1ls0n69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1ls0n69/i_work_night_shift_at_a_mcdonalds_in_utah_it_has/,I work Night Shift at a McDonald's in Utah... IT has Strange RULES TO FOLLOW!,"**Have you ever walked into a place that felt like it was alive—and not in a good way?** Not haunted. Not cursed. Just *wrong*. Like the walls were listening. Like the air had seen things. Like the building itself was holding its breath... waiting.

Some places aren't built for people. They're built to feed on them.

That’s the best way I can explain what happened to me during the worst—and last—job I ever took. A night shift at a McDonald’s that shouldn’t exist, on the edge of nowhere Utah, right where the map turns vague and the roads forget they were ever used.

Let me take you back to how it all began...

**I was broke. Proper broke.** The kind of broke where your stomach growls louder than your phone’s ringtone. My car had finally given up, coughing its last breath on a stretch of road with no cell service. Rent was overdue. My fridge held half a pickle and expired ketchup packets. Desperation was knocking—and I opened the door.

That’s when I found the Craigslist ad. Plain. Clinical. Almost robotic.

“Hiring Night Shift Crew. Immediate Start. No Experience Needed.”

No interview. No qualifications. Just show up. Red flag? Absolutely. But at the time, I would’ve scrubbed toilets blindfolded for a bag of chips and a gallon of gas. So I called.

A man answered. “Doug,” he said, in a tone so flat and emotionless it made my spine twitch. He sounded like he was reading a bedtime story to a corpse.

“Come in tonight,” Doug said. “Midnight. We’ll show you the ropes.”

I asked if there was an interview. He didn’t even pause. “Just show up. Wear black shoes. No logos.”

Click.

That was it. No location confirmation. No name repeat. Just silence and that creeping feeling like I’d agreed to something bigger than I realized.

**Midnight came too fast.**

The McDonald’s stood alone on the outskirts of town, where the streetlights stopped working and the highway coughed dust instead of cars. The sign out front flickered and buzzed like a dying firefly. The golden arches were half-lit, casting a jaundiced glow over an empty parking lot.

I pulled in, heart thudding like a faulty engine. The building looked... too still. Not closed, but not alive either.

When I stepped inside, the first thing I noticed wasn’t the smell of fries or grease. It was **cold**. Hospital cold. Morgue cold. The kind of cold that has nothing to do with air conditioning.

Everything was spotless—but in a way that felt unnatural. Like someone had been scrubbing the same surface for hours, trying to erase something that wouldn’t come off.

And there he was. Doug.Mid-50s. Gaunt. Skin pale as printer paper.

No smile. No greeting. Just a blank stare and a piece of paper shoved into my hands like a court summons. The words were printed in thick, ominous black ink. The title:

**RULES FOR THE NIGHT SHIFT**

Doug’s voice cracked the silence. “Read this. Memorize it. Break a rule, and you’re done.”

There were seven rules. Seven.

1. **Never open the drive-thru window after 1:11 AM.** *No exceptions.*  
2. **If the fryer dings more than twice in a row, unplug it. Wait five minutes. Do NOT check inside.**  
3. **If a customer knocks on the lobby door between 2:00 and 2:15 AM, ignore them. They are not real.**  
4. **The ice cream machine cleans itself at 3:00 AM. Do NOT interrupt it.**  
5. **If you hear the sound of a baby crying near the mop sink, turn the radio to static. Leave it that way until the crying stops.**  
6. **Between 3:33 and 3:44 AM, do not make eye contact with your reflection.**  
7. **Never, ever go into the PlayPlace after midnight. I don’t care what you hear.**  

I snorted. Not laughed—just an automatic nervous sound. Doug didn’t blink. Didn’t smile. Didn’t flinch.

“This isn’t a joke,” he said, his tone sharp enough to draw blood. “Follow the rules.”

And then he just turned and walked into the kitchen, like he'd delivered a weather report.

That was the beginning. I hadn’t even punched in yet.

But already, I felt it. This job wasn’t a job.

It was a test. Or a trap.

And I’d just stepped into the deep end, wearing bricks for shoes.

**The first hour?** Surprisingly normal. Deceptively so. That kind of normal where the silence is too still, like the world is holding its breath right before it screams.

I kept my head down. Wiped trays. Stacked ketchup packets into perfect little pyramids. Watched the dusty breakroom monitor replay the same five minutes of footage on an eternal loop. It was dull—but dull felt safe.

Until it didn’t.

It began softly. A sound so faint I thought I imagined it at first.

**Tap... tap.** A pause. Then again: **tap... tap... tap.**

Fingers? Knuckles? Something in between?It was coming from the drive-thru window.

Rule 1 came screaming back into my head like a siren:

**""Never open the drive-thru window after 1:11 AM. No exceptions.""**

I glanced at the glowing red digits on the microwave clock.**1:09 AM.**

Two minutes. That’s all the space I had between following the rules... and whatever came after.

I crept closer to the drive-thru. The lights outside had dimmed somehow—like someone had turned reality down a notch. The tapping had shifted now. It had rhythm. Purpose. It was trying to get my attention. Or wear me down.

I checked the monitor for the drive-thru camera.

**Nothing.** No static. No glitch. Just **pitch black**, as if the camera itself had closed its eyes.

Then the tapping escalated—**a knock.** Hard. Sharp. **Intentional.** And then another. And another. **Boom-boom. Boom-boom.** Like it was matching the beat of my heartbeat.

And then came the voice.

Muffled at first. A whisper pressed through glass.

“Hey. I see you. Open up.”

My throat constricted. I felt heat rise under my collar despite the cold air, like my body couldn’t decide if I was about to run or collapse.

The voice was male. Calm. Too calm. The kind of calm that only ever precedes something violent. I took a step back, instinctively.

Then it spoke again.

“You forgot my order. I paid already.”

There was no sound of a car. No hum of an engine. Just that voice, clear as if it was being piped into the building.

I didn’t answer. Didn’t move. Just stared at the floor like it might offer an escape.

Silence. Long enough to start to hope it was gone.

Then— The voice changed.

“Come on, sweetie. Let me in. It’s cold.”

My spine turned to glass.

That voice—**that was my mother.**

Same tone. Same lilt. Same phrasing she used when she used to knock on my door during storms and say, *“Let me in, honey. I just want to keep you safe.”*

Only thing is— My mother’s been dead for three years. I buried her. I saw the casket close. But her voice was outside that window.

My legs gave out. I slumped against the wall, breathing like I’d forgotten how. Shaking—full-body tremors like my bones were trying to escape.

And I swear, swear on everything—**the glass began to fog up.** No breath. No presence. But moisture. Like someone invisible was breathing inches away.

I did the only thing I could think of. I stumbled to the supply closet, slammed the door, and turned the lock with a trembling hand.

In the dark, I crouched between boxes of bleach and straws and held my breath like the air itself had turned traitor.

Outside the door, I could still hear her voice— soft now. Pleading. Melting between words that no longer sounded like anything human.

And then... silence.

Not peace. Not quiet. Just silence that sat too heavy.

Like something was waiting.

**And that’s when I knew... the rules weren’t warnings.** They were survival guides. And I’d just passed my first test.

But the shift wasn’t over. And there were six more rules to go.

**I emerged from the supply closet around 2:00 AM, heart still hammering like a fist against a locked coffin.** My legs felt like noodles. My throat was dry as bone dust. But the knocking had stopped. The voice pretending to be my mother had gone silent.

So I did what people always do when they don’t know what else to do—**I pretended everything was fine.** I went back to work.

I refilled the drink station. Wiped the counters for the tenth time. Tried not to glance at the drive-thru. I didn’t check the clock. I didn’t want to know.

Then—**knocking.** But this time, it came from the **lobby door.**

The front of the restaurant, where no one should be. Where no one *could* be. It was supposed to be locked.

I turned slowly, every part of me clenched with dread.

A man was standing there. No—**a figure.** Human-shaped, but not right. He wore a hoodie that clung to him like wet skin, the fabric **soaked and sagging**, dripping something that wasn’t rainwater. His face was pressed against the glass, smiling. But not *smiling*—**stretching.** Too wide. Too toothy. Like his mouth had forgotten where to stop.

“Hey man,” he said, voice bright and bubbly, like a sitcom character. “I forgot my wallet. You mind if I come back in real quick?”

My feet refused to move. My brain screamed *Rule 3.*

“If a customer knocks on the lobby door between 2:00 and 2:15 AM, ignore them. **They are not real.**”

I said nothing. Did nothing.

His smile slipped. Just like that—gone. His head twitched once, then again. **A glitch.** A sudden, robotic jerk left, right, left again, like his spine had rewired mid-sentence.

“You gonna leave me out here?”

His voice cracked now, full of static and threat.

“You can’t just ignore me.”

I didn’t answer. I **bolted**—straight to the bathroom, slamming the door and locking it like my life depended on it. Because it probably did.

I curled into the corner between the sink and hand dryer, eyes on the door handle. Waiting. Listening.

**Nothing.**

At **2:20**, I crept out. The lobby was empty. No footprints. No water trail. No man.

But something told me he hadn’t left. He’d just backed off. **For now.**

**By 2:45**, I was unraveling. My hands wouldn’t stop trembling. My thoughts felt like tangled wires. I couldn’t even pretend to focus—just stood staring at the fryer, mind blank, body braced.

It hadn’t made a sound all night.

Then—**DING.** I jumped.

**DING.** **DING.**

Three dings. Too many.

**“If the fryer dings more than twice in a row… unplug it. Do NOT check inside.”**

I didn’t think. I moved on instinct—lunged toward the plug, yanked it out with shaking fingers, and backed away like the fryer might explode or sprout legs.

The **smell** hit me first.

Not fries. Not grease. It was **burnt oil, scorched meat**, and something worse. Something human. Like **hair singed off a body**, or flesh left to rot in the sun.

I gagged. Covered my mouth. Stared at the unplugged fryer, waiting for it to move. It didn’t. Five minutes passed in agonizing slowness.

Eventually, I plugged it back in. Nothing happened. The smell faded—but not all the way. It **clung to the air**, stubborn and rotten.

I was starting to understand now. These weren’t just rules. **They were lifelines.**

And the hands tugging on the other end? **They weren’t human.**

**Then the clock struck 3:00 AM.** The moment it did, the **ice cream machine** let out a sound like a dying animal crossed with a dying engine. A mechanical groan. Lights blinked on—too bright, too sudden—casting pale green shadows across the floor.

It began to **hum** and **hiss**, like it had something alive inside it struggling to break out. Thick sludge oozed from the nozzle. But it wasn’t ice cream. It was **gray-white**, **bubbling**, and had the **texture of melting plastic**.

And the smell—**ammonia, bleach, and rot**—burned my nostrils.

I backed away, afraid it might reach out, might look at me.

And just as I whispered to myself, **""What the hell is happening?""**— **I heard it.**

The **crying.**

Faint, at first. Almost a whimper. Then steady. **A baby.**

It was coming from the **back corner.** Where the **mop sink** was.

Rule 5:

“If you hear the sound of a baby crying near the mop sink, **turn the radio to static**. Leave it that way until the crying stops.”

I ran. Not toward the sound—but toward the radio. It sat on a shelf in the supply room, buzzing with soft elevator music.

I grabbed the dial— But it wouldn’t move.

It was like trying to turn a cement block. My heart thundered. The crying got louder. Closer. I tried again. Nothing.

My fingers slipped with sweat. I screamed, cursed, **slammed the side of the radio**, and twisted again—hard.

It turned. Static hissed through the speaker like an exorcism.

The crying **spiked**—a high, angry shriek that shattered something inside me. Then, all at once— **Silence.**

Not relief. Not safety. Just silence. Like whatever had been crying... had started watching instead.

I stood there, breathing like I’d run a marathon. My bladder screamed. And honestly? **I almost wet myself.**

But I made it. **Three rules down. Four to go.**

And if I was right— **The worst hadn’t even started yet.**

**At 3:33 AM, I made a mistake.** One small slip. One glance. And it almost ended me.

I went to the bathroom. I needed a breather. I needed to feel human again. The cold tile. The dim light. The flickering fluorescent above the mirror. I didn’t mean to look. I swear to whatever’s left of my sanity—I wasn’t trying to break Rule 6.

*“Between 3:33 and 3:44 AM, do not make eye contact with your reflection.”*

I was just washing my hands. Trying to scrub the grime of fear off my skin. Trying to pretend I hadn’t heard crying babies, glitching men, and machines that bled bleach.

But when I glanced up—just a flick of the eyes—**I saw it.**

**My reflection didn’t move.**

I blinked. It didn’t.

I shifted. It stood still. Like a photograph frozen in a moment I hadn’t lived yet.

Then—**it smiled.**

Not my smile. Too wide. Too sharp. Like it had **too many teeth** and no reason to hide them anymore.

It tilted its head like it was examining me. Amused. Hungry.

Then it stepped forward. But I didn’t.

**It moved first.** **It moved without me.**

I ran. Didn’t dry my hands. Didn’t flush. Didn’t look back.

And I will never—**never**—go in that bathroom again.

By then, my mind was unraveling like an old VHS tape in a microwave. I’d made it this far by following the rules. Each one had nearly broken me—but breaking one? That would’ve done worse.

So I clung to the last line on that paper like it was a lifeline made of razor wire.

**Rule 7:** “Never, ever go into the PlayPlace after midnight. I don’t care what you hear.”

The PlayPlace sat in the far corner of the lobby. Plastic tubes. Slides. Nets. A place meant for laughter and scraped knees.

Now? Now it looked like the **ribcage of something long dead**, just barely pretending to be fun.

It was quiet. At first.

But then—**the thuds started.** Soft at first. Like a foot slipping. A body dragging.

Like something crawling.

I told myself it didn’t matter. Not my business. Not my shift. **Not real.**

But then— **a voice.**

“Help… please… I’m stuck… it’s dark…”

A child’s voice. High. Fragile. Exactly what it needed to be.

I froze. Heart pounding. I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

Then—again.

“My leg… I’m hurt… I can’t move…”

It sounded scared. Lost. So very **human.**

And for a split second—**I almost believed it.** My foot lifted. Just an inch. Just enough to turn toward the PlayPlace.

Then— **it laughed.**

Not a child’s laugh. Not even close.

**Low. Scraping. Mocking.** Like sandpaper on bone.

“You almost broke a rule,” it said.

**It spoke.** Not cried. Not screamed. **Spoke.**

And its voice wasn’t coming from inside the PlayPlace. It was coming from **inside my head.**

I didn’t think. Didn’t scream. **I ran.**

And that’s when I knew—**this place isn’t a restaurant.** It’s a trap with a drive-thru.

Every rule was a dare. Every sound, a snare. And the ones who break the rules? They don’t get written about.

They get **replaced.**

**Doug showed up at exactly 6:00 AM.** Not a minute early. Not a second late. Like he’d been waiting outside the entire time, watching. Listening. Or worse—*counting.*

He stepped inside with his usual dead stare, skin like old paper, and said only:

“You made it. Most don’t.”

That was it. No congratulations. No concern. Just... that.

I asked the question that had been chewing on the inside of my skull all night. **“What is this place?”**

Doug shrugged. A little too casually. Like I’d asked him how the coffee machine worked.

“It’s a job. You want night shifts or not?”

That should’ve been my moment. My exit. My cue to run and *never look back*.

But I didn’t. Because rent was still due. Because my car still didn’t start. Because I was too deep in now—and something inside me needed to know more.

So I came back. **Every night.**

At first, the rules stayed the same. Seven lines on a greasy paper, typed in bold font.

Then one night, there were ten. Next week, twelve.

Now? **Twenty-seven.**

And they’re not just rules anymore. They’re... **warnings.**

Some don’t even make sense—until they do.

**Rule 19:** “Do not acknowledge the birthday clown if he waves.” **Rule 23:** “If the nugget box breathes, put it in the walk-in freezer.”

And you might laugh. I did too. Until I saw the clown.

Until I heard the nugget box breathing like a paper bag in labor.

Last week, one of the new hires—Jason—broke Rule 1. He thought it was all some hazing prank.

At **1:12 AM**, he opened the drive-thru window. Just to “see what happens.”

We never saw him again.

The security footage? **Glitched.** Like someone chewed through the frames and spat out static.

Doug didn’t even blink.

No investigation. No questions. Just another name scratched off the schedule.

This job pays in **cash**. No taxes. No W-2s. No paper trail. Just an envelope at the end of the week—thicker than it should be.

But at some point... it stopped being about the money.

Now I stay because I **have to know.**

What is this place? Why the rules? And who—or what—am I actually working for?

Because this isn’t a restaurant. It’s a ritual. A machine that runs on obedience and fear. And I’m starting to think I’m not on the outside of it anymore.

I’m part of it.

**So tonight... I’m breaking Rule 7.** The one they say *never* to test. The one that’s been there since the beginning:

**“Never, ever go into the PlayPlace after midnight. I don’t care what you hear.”**

But I hear it now. Every night.

The thuds. The whispers. The laughter that doesn’t belong to any living child.

And I think it wants me to come in. Or maybe... it’s daring me not to.

I don’t expect to clock out. I don’t expect to walk out.

But I have to know.

So I’m taking a flashlight, a radio tuned to static, and **one final copy of the rules**. I’m going in. Into the plastic tunnels. Into the dark.

Into the mouth of whatever this place really is.

Anyways, a little about me: 33, I live in 2 places in the United States. I work on Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones. I work in 2 places; I’m busy and very intense. I don’t have lots of time for nonsense, but I consider myself a fair and kind person.

Here's a bit about myself: I genuinely seek the positive in people, yet I also rely on my intuition. While I have a solid circle of friends, most are married with children, which makes it difficult for us to spend time together. I fully respect their commitments, but it feels like our life paths are diverging right now. Therefore, I'm not looking to connect with married friends at this time; I’m open to friendships with those who are divorced, but I want to steer clear of any drama involving ex-partners—life's too short for that. 

As for me, I’m 33 years old and split my time between two locations in the United States. My work spans both Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones, and I juggle responsibilities at two different jobs. I'm busy and focused, leaving little room for nonsense.

As a passionate reader and a devoted audiobooks enthusiast, I find immense joy in immersing myself in stories, especially while traveling. Listening to books is a practical way for me to indulge in literature, and there's something truly magical about the experience of being read to! I often crank up the speed to double time, so if you're up for a discussion about books, I’d absolutely love that. Recently, I was deeply moved by ""The River is Waiting"" by Wally Lamb; though it was a poignant read, it left a lasting impression on my heart and shifted my perspective on significant topics. That's the beauty of books for me!

Music truly means a lot to me. Right now, I'm putting together a dinner playlist that is coming together beautifully, featuring artists such as Kacey Musgraves and Ella Fitzgerald. I actually have a 20-hour playlist that includes a wide variety of genres. I recently stumbled upon the band “The Scarlet Opera,” and I'm really enjoying their sound. I have Apple Music, so if you're interested in checking out my playlists, that would be great!

I have a deep appreciation for theater, ballet, and opera. There's something truly enchanting about dressing up to enjoy these remarkable performances. However, I'm equally fond of TV and movies. While getting dressed for an night on a town  is enjoyable, I also cherish the comfort of donning sweatpants and a concert t-shirt while staying in.

I have a passion for dining out and discovering new restaurants. Although I enjoy cooking at home, I've recently found myself in a phase where exploring brunch and dinner venues with friends is my main focus. I’m a huge fan of iced coffee and love to share ample amounts of champagne with great company! Brunch, lunch, and food in general are all favorites of mine!



I've traveled extensively, from Bali to Paris to Kenya, and I've explored all 50 states. At this point, it feels like I've ticked off most of the destinations on my wishlist. However, if you mention any city, I can definitely provide you with some fantastic restaurant suggestions!   
Here are a  fun fact about me :During my college summers, I spent time working in Florida, where I had a job that involved a certain famous mouse. Any guesses on what I did?

I just finished watching the first episode of The Pitt and absolutely loved it! However, I'm watching it with my mom, and she texted me saying she can only handle one episode a night. Ugh!

I'm searching for someone between the ages of 26 and 50 who resides in the United States and has a preference for voting blue, just like I do. I’m not particularly interested in sports or video games, so if those are your main sources of entertainment, we may not be a good fit. Additionally, I'm not a fan of hiking or camping, so please keep that in mind!

Black. Shiny. Not mine. It curled slightly at the end, clinging to the collar of his jacket. I froze.......

Chapter 1

Some mornings felt like scenes from a perfect movie. The kind with golden light filtering through spotless windows, where the coffee was always warm, and the laughter of children echoed through the halls like music.



That morning was one of those mornings.



I sat on the velvet cream couch in our sun-drenched living room, cradling a warm mug between my palms. Earl Grey with a splash of almond milk—the same way I'd made it every morning since Max was born. There was something comforting about the ritual, about knowing the rhythm of my own life down to the second. In this house, in this moment, everything felt exactly as it should.



The only sound was the faint hum of the dishwasher and the rustle of branches outside. A breeze slipped in through the open window, carrying the scent of lavender and wet grass. And for a moment, I closed my eyes and thought: This is it. This is the life I dreamed of.



Then came the sound I loved most in the world—tiny footsteps, fast and light on the stairs, like joy coming to life.



""Mama!"" Ellie shouted, bursting into the room in her strawberry pajamas. Her curls bounced with every step as she ran straight to me. ""Come! Come quick!""



""What is it, baby?"" I laughed, setting the mug down.



""Daddy's making waffles!"" she beamed, eyes wide. ""With strawberries!""



Max followed behind her, dragging his stuffed dinosaur by the tail. ""And chocolate chips!"" he added. ""Tell him I want lots!""



Their little voices always made my heart feel like it would split from fullness. I ruffled Max's dark curls and kissed Ellie's forehead. ""Alright, let's go inspect the chef's work.""



We marched down the hallway into the kitchen like soldiers on a sweet mission. And there he was—Ethan—standing behind the kitchen island in a fitted gray t-shirt, sleeves rolled up, hair a little messy in the front. He looked so... ordinary. So real. Like love never left the room when he was in it.



""There you two are,"" he said, smiling as he stirred a glass bowl full of waffle batter. ""Look at my little taste testers.""



""Daddy,"" Ellie gasped, ""Can I pour it?""



He handed her the ladle without hesitation. ""Of course. Carefully, alright?""



""Always,"" she whispered with exaggerated seriousness, then grinned.



Max climbed onto the bar stool beside her and reached for a spoon. ""I wanna help too.""



""Max,"" I said, pulling him onto my lap, ""you're our official chocolate chip guy.""



""I'm the boss,"" he announced.



""You are,"" I agreed, smiling into his neck.



Ethan leaned over to kiss my cheek. ""Good morning, babe.""



""Good morning,"" I whispered back, letting his scent linger—a mix of soap, warmth, and something else that was just him. ""You're starting the day strong.""



""Bribing the kids with waffles so we can have a proper date night tonight.""



I looked up. ""La Belle Table?""



He nodded. ""Reserved at seven. Just you and me.""



I felt my smile grow. Even after ten years together, Ethan had this ability to make me feel like the only person in the room. And that restaurant—it was where he took me the night he proposed. Still my favorite.



We kept cooking together, laughing and flipping waffles. It was messy and chaotic and perfect. Ellie smeared whipped cream across the counter. Max nearly dropped a bowl. Ethan cleaned it all up without a word, still smiling.



We were that kind of family. Or at least, I thought we were.



After breakfast, I was wiping sticky syrup off Max's chin when I heard the front door creak open.



My father stepped in, as usual, unannounced but never unwelcome.



""Morning,"" he said, in that clipped tone that always carried authority, even in sweatpants.



""Dad!"" Ellie and Max cheered in unison.



He gave them a rare smile, then turned to me. ""Juliet.""



""Hi, Dad,"" I said, rising to kiss his cheek.



He turned to Ethan, eyeing the waffle mess. ""Playing chef?""



Ethan grinned. ""Trying to earn my dinner date.""



My father's mouth twitched into something like approval. That was the thing about Charles Duvall—my father, the man who ran billion-dollar contracts and expected perfection. He didn't often compliment, but when he did, it meant something.



Chapter 2

""Smart move,"" he said.



I caught Ethan's glance—he was still the boy who worked so hard to earn my father's approval. Even now, working for him, wearing a tailored suit, managing projects worth millions, there was still that quiet hunger for Charles Duvall's respect.



After breakfast, we headed to the lake behind our house. Ethan carried the picnic basket, Dad brought the fishing rods, and the kids ran ahead with their nets and buckets like explorers. The dock creaked under our steps, familiar and worn, but still strong.



The water was calm. The sky was a watercolor wash of soft blues and peach. Max squealed when he caught a tiny sunfish. Ellie tried to scoop it into her pink bucket but shrieked when it wiggled. Ethan laughed, showing them how to gently release it back.



And I just sat there, watching them—my whole heart scattered across that wooden dock.



My father pulled up a folding chair beside me. ""You did good, Juliet.""



""I did lucky,"" I said.



He shook his head. ""No. You made a good choice. I've seen men in business. Ethan... he's one of the good ones.""



I nodded, because I believed that too.



Or at least, I used to.



We stayed on the dock for hours. Had sandwiches on the grass. Watched the kids nap on the picnic blanket. Ethan carried Max upstairs afterward, whispering a lullaby under his breath. He brushed Ellie's curls out of her face as he tucked her in. I remember thinking—God, how can I love him more than I do right now?



I would've sworn there was no room for doubt.



But that changed the moment I went to hang up his jacket.



It was a small thing. So stupid. So innocent. He had left it on the banister. I picked it up to put it in the closet. I was humming something, probably still full of sugar and sunshine and waffles.



Then I saw it.



A strand of hair.



Long. Black. Shiny.



Not mine.



I'm blonde. Always have been.



This was different. It wasn't just a stray fiber or dust. It was unmistakably a woman's hair—curled slightly at the end, clinging to the collar of his jacket like a thread unraveling my life.



I froze.



Everything inside me went quiet. Still. Like a movie pausing mid-scene.



I held the strand between my fingers and stared at it like it might whisper answers.



Ethan came down the stairs a few seconds later.



""You okay?"" he asked, walking into the living room.



I blinked. ""Yeah. Just... zoning out.""



He smiled, completely oblivious. ""The kids are knocked out. Want a cup of tea?""



I nodded slowly, still holding the jacket.



He walked past me into the kitchen and filled the kettle. And I stood there, not knowing what to do.



Do I ask him?



Do I wait?



Do I pretend I never saw it?



My chest felt tight. Like my ribs couldn't contain everything breaking inside me.



I finally dropped the jacket and walked into the kitchen. Ethan handed me a mug and pressed a kiss to my forehead.



He still smelled like Ethan. Still looked at me with love. Still talked about our date night like everything was normal.



But it wasn't.



I tucked the strand of hair into my pocket.



And that's the moment—not when he lied, or cheated, or confessed—that's the moment my perfect world started to crack.



Because love isn't supposed to feel like a question mark.



And I suddenly realized—I was married to a man I didn't fully know.



Chapter 3

I thought I had let it go.



That single black strand of hair, I told myself it was nothing. Told myself it had no meaning. That it didn't matter.



But it stayed.



It lingered in the corners of my mind, curling tighter with every thought. Even as I tried to be present, kissing the kids goodnight, folding laundry, setting the table for breakfast, it clung to me like something unfinished. Like a thread begging to be pulled.



Two days had passed since I found it. And I still couldn't sleep properly.



Ethan hadn't done anything suspicious. He was himself smiling, kind, helpful with the kids, affectionate with me. Every bit the perfect husband.



But I didn't feel perfect anymore.



I felt unsettled. Tense. Like my instincts were walking a step ahead of me, urging me toward something I wasn't ready to know.



That morning, while Ethan was in the shower, I walked into the bedroom. Not because I needed something...because I had to know. I needed to prove myself wrong. I needed to find nothing and laugh at myself for being ridiculous.



The closet door creaked open with a soft sigh. His jacket was hanging exactly where he'd left it. I checked the pockets first.....nothing. My breath was tight, shallow, like my lungs had forgotten how to behave.



Then I noticed the hoodie he'd tossed into the laundry basket the night before.



I didn't think.



I knelt, pulled it out, and reached into the front pouch.



My fingers hit something soft.



A small, square shape.



I froze.



No.



I pulled it out slowly.



A black velvet box.



Everything in me dropped.



It wasn't a flash of panic, it was cold and slow, like being submerged in water. I turned the box over in my hand, still kneeling on the floor like a woman praying. I didn't open it. I couldn't.



I already knew what it was.



A ring.



Why would he have a ring?



We were already married. There was no birthday coming. No obvious occasion. And more than that... he hadn't said a word.



A woman doesn't find a hidden ring in her husband's pocket and feel warmth.



She feels fear.



I set the box down on the edge of the hamper and sat back on my heels, my heartbeat pulsing behind my eyes.



It had to be for someone else.



The woman from the strand. The black hair. The one I didn't know.



I stood slowly, like my body had lost its strength, and put the box back exactly where I found it. I smoothed the hoodie, replaced it gently, and closed the lid.



Then I walked into the bathroom, brushed my teeth like nothing happened, and smiled at Ethan when he came out of the shower, a towel slung around his waist.



I don't remember what we talked about that morning.



All I remember was how steady he seemed. How gentle. How normal.



It made the fear worse.



⸻



Later that afternoon, while Ethan played outside with the kids, I opened my laptop in the kitchen and stared at his open email tab.



It was an accident, truly, he'd left it open. I wasn't snooping. Not at first.



But then I saw it.



An email confirmation for a dinner reservation. The subject line read: La Belle Table — 7:00 PM, June 17th, Party of Two.



My stomach clenched.



Chapter 4

La Belle Table.



That was our place. Where he'd proposed. Where we celebrated every anniversary. Where he used to hold my hand across the table and whisper that I was the best decision he ever made.



Why would he take her there?



Why would he bring another woman to the one place that meant the most to us?



I stared at the screen, frozen, as if the email might change itself.



Maybe it was for business.



Maybe it was a mistake.



Maybe I was wrong.



But I knew I wasn't.



The ring. The black hair. The secret reservation.



I closed the laptop gently and walked to the window. Ethan was pushing Max on the swing, his face full of laughter. Ellie was skipping around with a crown of daisies in her curls.



I had never felt more alone.



⸻



By evening, I had barely eaten. I moved through the motions of motherhood — dinner, baths, bedtime stories, like I was playing a role in a life I didn't recognize anymore.



At 6:30 PM, Ethan came into the bedroom wearing his deep blue shirt, the one I'd bought for him last year, the one that always made his eyes seem softer.



""You ready?"" he asked.



""For what?""



He smiled. ""You forgot?""



My throat tightened. ""Forgot what?""



He walked over and held out a small black box.



I stared.



The same box.



The one from the hoodie.



He opened it with a quiet flick.



Inside was a ring.



White gold. A vintage-cut sapphire, deep blue with flecks of light, surrounded by a halo of diamonds.



""I saw you looking at it last year at that antique place in Cape Cod,"" he said gently. ""You said it looked like the sky before a storm.""



My lips parted, but I couldn't speak.



""For our anniversary,"" he said. ""Ten years.""



I blinked. ""I... I didn't realize...""



He laughed softly. ""I know. You've been so busy. It's okay. I wanted it to be a surprise.""



He slipped the ring onto my finger.



It fit perfectly.



Just like it had the first time, ten years ago.



And for a moment, I couldn't breathe.



Not because I was afraid anymore, but because I wasn't.



This wasn't for another woman.



It was for me.



All of it.



The reservation. The ring. The quiet love behind it.



My face burned with shame.



How could I have thought...



How could I have doubted...



Ethan leaned in and kissed my forehead.



""Dinner's at seven,"" he whispered. ""You still have time to change.""



⸻



La Belle Table hadn't changed.



Chapter 5

The same golden lighting, soft jazz, and linen-covered tables. The same scent of fresh herbs and clean wine glasses. The same seat by the window that he'd asked for the one where he proposed a decade ago.



Ethan held my hand as we walked in.



I wore a black dress I hadn't touched in years. He told me I looked beautiful. I told him thank you because I couldn't find better words for what I felt.



I expected him to ask why I was so quiet. But he didn't.



He just smiled at me, like he already understood.



He ordered my favorite dish. I tasted it without tasting it. The wine blurred the edges of my guilt.



He was kind. Funny. Gentle.



He talked about our future. About taking the kids to Italy next summer. About repainting the lake house. About maybe adopting a dog.



And all I could think about was the ring on my hand.



I looked down at it more than once during the dinner.



Not because I was admiring it but because I was remembering the moment I found it.



How I had assumed the worst.



How I had convinced myself I was being replaced.



And now, here we were a decade in and he was still choosing me.



I felt like a fool.



A woman with too many doubts. Too much imagination. Too little faith.



""I love you, Jules,"" he said as the dessert arrived. ""I don't say it enough.""



""You say it,"" I whispered. ""I just don't always hear it.""



""You hearing it now?""



I nodded.



For the first time in days, I was.



⸻



When we got home, the house was quiet. The babysitter had already left. The kids were asleep, tucked under their blankets like little secrets.



Ethan took my hand and led me upstairs.



We didn't talk much.



But we kissed like we remembered everything. Like we'd never stopped.



When he fell asleep beside me, I stayed awake for a little while longer.



Listening to his breath. Watching the moonlight crawl across the ceiling.



I touched the ring again.



It was real.



He loved me.



He wasn't cheating.



And maybe, just maybe, the black strand was nothing after all.

Did I go too far?,"My boyfriend of 6 months drove alone 2 hours to visit his sister (25f) to celebrate the 4th. I stayed home with my family. The sister (who I barely know) called it a night early and asked him to leave, even though he was in no condition to drive. He sent me garbled text messages so I called him immediately. He was incoherent, slurring his speech, yawning, and insisting he was fine because he drank coffee and had a sip of water before leaving. I begged and begged for him not to get in the car but he did not listen, and in a panic I was shouting at him to pull over and rest for a while. I have always been the law-abiding, rule conscious, safety-first person in our relationship. He enjoys taking risks, experimenting, and going with the flow. He especially loves driving fast (he owns a sports car) and I was absolutely terrified. 


He acknowledged it was not a good idea to drive but insisted he needed to get home and that everything would be fine. This is the first time in my knowing him that he has done this. No matter how much I begged, sobbed, pleaded, yelled, cursed, threatened, bargained, and reasoned, he brushed me off each time. I realized my screeching would probably distract him and make driving more dangerous, so I hung up, but shortly called him back. I calmly told him I would call the police and report his name, address, phone number, location, and license plate if he would not pull over in 5 minutes. That finally made him listen and I made him facetime me to prove to me that he pulled over. I forced him to drink water on camera too. He was absolutely livid, as was I. He belligerently swore at me and called me an asshole for doing this to him. He said he shouldn’t have texted me and he just won’t text me next time. He rested on the road for 30 minutes under threat of me calling 911 from my landline, during which he repeatedly told me to leave him alone and mind my own business. After that, he said he can no longer trust me. He told me not to call him and hung up on me. 

I fear that my threatening to call the cops crossed the line - he is not white and he has had negative experiences with law enforcement. I would hate for him to be arrested, but I truly didn’t know what else to do in order to keep him everyone else safe. 

I have suspected he has some sort of adrenaline addiction, if such a term exists. He does not drink or get drunk often at all, nor does he smoke or do drugs, but he regularly takes risks with his driving and in general does not do things safely. I am worried about him and I fear he might have a problem.

Was threatening to report him to police going too far? Please note I’d rather get him help than just dump him (even though he may have dumped me tonight, who knows). How can I get him to be safer without further pushing him away?",0,1751686629.0,relationship_advice,6,0.5,False

Prologue

Prologue



Indy



I came to the Maggie Valley area to start over with my daughter, Tinsley, to start over. We needed a fresh start, and that meant not being in the same state as my douchebag ex. I wanted my daughter to have the best I could give her. I also wanted to settle somewhere that moved at a much slower pace than Fort Wayne. When my grandmother was alive, my parents would take me to Kentucky to visit her. She lived almost in North Carolina. When I discovered Maggie Valley, I instantly fell in love, so I decided to relocate here.



It seemed perfect, and it was … until the Feral Kings MC took over the old amusement-turned zipline-park, Ghost Town in the Sky. In the blink of an eye, my peaceful refuge was being destroyed. There also wasn’t much I could do about it. I kept my head down and only ventured into town when I had to. I ran my business as best as I could, while trying to save money to move the hell out of dodge. It may seem like a lame plan, but it’s all I could do.



Sadly, today is one of those days that I had to venture into Bryson City. It was actually for a wonderful reason. I served as a witness for Phillip and Max’s wedding. I was so happy for them, even if I didn’t understand their choice of venues. I mean, we’re steps away from the Smoky Mountains, yet those two bozos decide to get married at the local courthouse. Still, for what it was, it was a beautiful wedding, and my two friends are extremely happy.



Now, I’m heading back home. I’m also running late. I still need to check on my animals and get some things done in my office before Tinny gets off the school bus. I took a back road, hoping not to see anyone. It’s also shadier than most areas, which is nice because it’s miserable outside today. The heat is suffocating, and it’s so humid that my blonde hair is trying to poof up—which sucks because it took me an hour to straighten out my curls. I love my hair and hate it at the same time. Some days I want to shave it off and let it start over to see if it grows back being more manageable. It doesn’t help matters that my air conditioner isn’t working. I have the windows down, but that seems to let more heat in than actually help. If I can ever get my head above water and pay off my student loans, I’d move out of this place. That’s not happening anytime soon. No one wants to move to a town that lives in fear.



As if taking their cue from my thoughts, I hear the racking of pipes and the loud roar of motorcycles. I look in the review mirror and see a couple of members from the Feral MC coming up fast behind me. I try not to panic. Most days, I’m normally in my truck. I keep a shotgun in it. Today, I have nothing. Which leaves me defenseless and vulnerable. To make matters worse, this road doesn’t get a lot of traffic at all. It’s why I chose it, thinking it would be safer.



My heart runs away with me as they get right behind me, then move alongside my car. I try to keep my gaze on the road, but they stay right beside me for so long, I can’t help but look. One of them grins, giving a cocky wave as he goes ahead of me. However, he’s staying at a slow speed. I know this is to keep me from going faster and getting away. When my gaze turns to the other guy. He uses his left hand to hold his thumb up and his index finger out—making the shape of a gun. He aims right between my eyes and makes a shooting motion, before flicking his wrist up and pointing up, blowing on his finger.



The message is clear, and it terrifies me. I slow down even more, and with a laugh that I can’t hear over the bike, he takes off, the other guy joining him. My heart is slamming against my chest as I decide to pull over. I shut my car off, lock the door and crouch down out of view. I want to give those assholes time to get out of the area. I don’t want to be anywhere near them. I’m going to have to get a handgun and keep it in my glove box. I hate to. I don’t like keeping guns around Tinny. Today could have been a disaster, though. I need to keep myself safe for my daughter. Thanks to her so-called father’s dumb life choices, I’m all she has.



I’m not sure how long I sit beside the road. There hasn’t been any other traffic except for two more bikers. They’re not part of the Feral’s, but I still hid from them. Luckily, these guys barely noticed my car. They did slow down, but I kept crouched down like a coward. To be fair, I don’t know these guys and I had no idea if I could trust them. They left without issue, but I still just kept sitting here like an idiot. It has to have been a good twenty minutes since the Feral Kings riders passed me. Surely, they would be far gone by now. The other two didn’t seem to be dangerous—or at least have any ill intent. So, I’m not really that worried about them.



I send up a silent prayer for protection and decide to start going again. To be safe, I keep my speed slow. I don’t want to risk running into them again. Getting the attention of any member of the Feral MC is very bad for your health. The whole town has seen that over the last few months.



I drive for a bit, and my heart rate is just now starting to get back to normal. I’m even contemplating speeding up. That’s when I hear the unmistakable sound of gunfire. I let out a startled shriek, my body jerking in response. Fear courses through me as I white-knuckle my steering wheel. I can tell it’s just right up the road from here I’m at. It also doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure the sound probably came from the assholes who taunted me earlier. If there’s one thing about the Feral MC that most of Maggie Valley knows, it’s that they love to shoot up the town and its people.



Shit. If I’m right, they’ll likely circle back around to make sure I don’t find out what—or who—they shot at. Heck, they might decide to circle back just to torture me some more. I was lucky they left me alone the first time. They aren’t known for letting an opportunity pass them by. Last month, they raped two women in town. The crime was reported—not that the local law did shit about it. Those women left the area quickly afterward. I would leave myself—I just don’t have that option. At least, not right now. I truly am working on it. I just need to make sure my beautiful daughter can at least have a roof over her head when we move. I’ve put in some job applications, but to date, I’ve not heard anything back. It’s getting me down. I can’t lie. I thought it would be easy to find a job. Vets willing to work for others and not hang their own shingle out aren’t very common. I love owning my own business, but I’d let it go in a heartbeat to make sure me and my daughter are safe.



I quickly decide to cut off onto an old service road that leads back to a gas well. I’ve seen my friend Cooper turn off here many times. He works on gas lines. He and his wife bring their thirteen-year-old German Shepherd to me for care and they’re always doing sweet things for me and my Tinny.



They maintain service roads pretty well out this way. I figure it can’t be that bad. I’m hoping I can hide there until I can make sure that the bikers are long gone. I pull my vehicle off to the side of the dirt road, parking behind a bunch of overgrown brush in hopes that it hides my car enough. I don’t think they’ll come looking for me, but I want to be safe.



Next, I start scaling the hill, to make my way toward where I think the gunfire came from. I truly do want to see what happened, but I must do it safely. I’m terrified. I can’t afford to get caught up in anything to do with that damn gang—and that’s exactly what they are. They’re pure evil. Yet, I couldn’t live with myself if they attacked another woman and left her to die. One of the women before lost her vision because they beat her so badly. The memory of seeing how broken she was still haunts me.



I carefully make my way to the top of the rocky hill. There’s a large rock along the edge, and I hold on to it as I hunker down and look at the road below. As I take in the scene, I’m afraid to make a noise. At first glance, it looks like the two unknown bikers that passed me piled it up in a steep curve. One is face down in the road, beside a big tree, his bike on its side. The other guy is much bigger, and he’s face down, too. He’s to the side, by a guardrail. My first instinct is to go down the hill and try to help. That’s when I see those assholes from the Ferals come out of hiding. They’re each packing rifles on their back. It’s clear they shot them down. The two unknown men didn’t really have a chance.



I figure it’s some type of MC war. Although the big guy they’re currently dragging to the guardrail is someone I don’t recognize. The other guy that’s lying on the ground by the tree doesn't look familiar either. They’re killing the big guy and I’m weak as fuck, letting it play out. In my defense, I’ve seen what happens when someone stands up to them. Maybe if I had a gun or something, I’d intervene. I don’t.



I bite my lip to keep from crying out as I watch them dump the man over the guardrail, toward the lake below. After laughing and giving each other a high-five, they take off. I carefully make my way back to my car. I’m physically ill as I get back on the road. It’d be safer to keep driving and go home. I can’t do it, though. I have to see if I can help these men. I don’t know what I’ll do if the others come back, but I can’t just leave them to die. I also can’t call an ambulance right away, because if they see cops and rescue squads, they’ll know I was close by. It would put me and my daughter in the crosshairs because I was the only vehicle they passed. They’d come for me.



I park on the side of the road with my flashers on. I grab a first aid kit that I keep under my front seat and run immediately to the guy by the tree. The first thing I do is check his pulse. He’s dead. I turn him over and close his eyes. Tears begin to fall, and I immediately feel like the worst person alive. Maybe if I had called for an ambulance, it might have helped. That’s stupid. I know it wouldn’t have. The man was shot almost directly through the heart. There’s blood everywhere.



I swipe at my tears with the back of my hand and look over the hill. The guy rolled almost to the bottom, but not quite. He’s actually pretty close to where people go for lake access. I make a quick decision and jump in my car and drive around the curve, then take a right at the foot of the hill to the rough ramp people use for canoes and such. The lake is nice, but there’s no big boats allowed on it.



I jog over and try to get my bearings. I find the man and climb up to him. I’m relieved as hell to discover that he has a pulse. He’s so big, there’s no way I’m going to be able to pull him off this hill. I wince, because there’s nothing else that I can do. If I call an ambulance and the Feral Kings MC finds out this guy is still breathing, they will kill him. With that being my sole thought, I put my hands on his chest and push him down the hill, so he’ll finish rolling to the bottom.



Now, I work out at the local gym. I even do strength and conditioning. That said, this guy is as big as a grizzly bear. I put my arms under each of his armpits and tug on him to get him to my car. It takes a lot of freaking time and there’s not a part of my body that doesn’t hurt by the time I accomplish the small ten feet of distance—which feels more like a thousand at this point. Once he’s by the door to my backseat. I try to figure out how to get him inside. I pull until he’s partially sitting up, his head leaning on my backseat. I go to the other side and get on my hands and knees on my seat. It takes a lot of pulling—sadly, I’m pretty sure I banged his head on my door and other areas of my car way too much—but I finally get him inside the car. Okay, so he rolls over to the floorboard, and he looks very uncomfortable. Still, he’s in. My next problem is he's so long that I can’t close the door. I kind of—almost—shut his foot in the door before I discovered that. I somehow scrunch his legs up and get the door closed. By this time, my body and muscles are screaming at me to throw in the towel. I can’t just yet. I have to get out of here. I jump inside and start my car. I put it in drive with a thankful breath, then I stop. It's at this point, I realize I left my first aid kit somewhere. Slamming it back into park, I retrace my steps until I find the kit and then run back to my car. I get on the road and head straight for my place. I don’t trust going to the hospital. I don’t know who this guy is, but he has a better chance of survival with me as his doctor instead of going to the hospital where I know the Kings will find him and finish him off. Once my heart is beating somewhat normal—although still way too fast—I fish out my cell from my cupholder. I call Cooper. He’s the only guy that I can trust.



“Hey, Indy. Everything okay? Don’t normally hear from you this time of day.”



“No. Everything is bad, Coop. Really bad.”



“Tell me what’s wrong.”



“I need you to first call 9-1-1. Tell them you saw a biker piled up in the horseshoe curve before you get to Twin Knob Access Point.”



“Can’t we just let the fucker suffer? The town could use one less of them,” he mutters.



“He’s not one of the Feral’s. In fact, I’m pretty sure some of Eyeball’s psychopaths shot and killed this guy. That’s why I can’t do it. If they research who called and it comes back it was a woman, they’ll know it was me because they passed me.”



“Fuck, Indy. I thought we discussed you keeping a low profile until I was able to get some men out here to take out the trash.”



“I’ve been trying, believe me.”



“Okay, honey. I’ll do it. Do you need anything else?”



“Well yeah, I kind of do. Could you come out to my place? I have a small …” I stop talking as I look over the shoulder at the behemoth biker in my floorboard. “Make that one very large problem that I need your help with.”



“What is it?”



“One of the guys is still alive, and he’s in the back of my car. I got him in here, but I don’t think I’m strong enough to get him in my house. I can’t take him to the hospital because …” I let my explanation trail off because I know Cooper will understand.



“Eyeball will finish him and maybe you. Okay, darlin’. I’ll be right out. Keep your car doors locked.”



“Thanks, Cooper.”



“You can thank me by fixing me some of your chili. Don’t tell Iva, but her chili is weak as water. Yours will make hair grow on your chest.”



“Um … thanks, I think.”



“Be there shortly,” he says as I hang up.



I realize I’m still crying. I can’t seem to stop—even amid all of my panic. A man died today. I just hope I can get the one that I’m bringing home to survive. It’s going to be kind of hard to turn in a dead body and explain I was trying to save him without bringing him to a hospital …



Shit!



Chapter 1

Chapter 1



Indy



“You think he’ll make it?” Iva asks.



“I think so. The shot went clean through. I didn’t even have to dig it out. It missed anything vital, too. I don’t think he would have lost consciousness except for the huge knot on his head. I’d feel more comfortable if I could take him to the hospital, though.”



“He’d probably be more comfortable, too,” she points out.



I frown, looking at the freaking huge man that is currently stretched out on two steel operating tables I pushed together. Even with doing that, his feet are hanging off one end. Of course, my tables are made to hold large dogs—not people.



“If I take him to the hospital, they may find him,” I point out. “You know this town as much as I do. They’ll hand him over to that asshole Eyeball out of fear. Taking this guy in will just sign his death warrant.”



“So, what are you going to do?” she asks as I let out a sigh.



“I’m going to take a leap of faith,” I respond quietly. I also pray I’m not making the wrong decision. “I’m going to keep him hidden until he heals.”



“You said he was going to survive.”



“Yes,” I answer. “I’m just not sure how long it’s going to take for him to heal.”



“Then what do you want to do? I can tell there’s something going on in your mind.”



“I’m going to have to set up a room for him in the house and move him. I don’t like the idea with my daughter being there, but I don’t really have a choice. Maybe I can get Coop to fix a lock on the outside so I can lock him in at night until I know what kind of person he is.”



I don’t mean to, but I find myself walking over toward the unconscious man currently covered in an old white hospital sheet. When I found him, he was soaking wet. I think he may have pulled himself out of the lake. That worries me because of the open wound. I stripped him down. Then I made a concentrated effort to clean all the debris from his body and sanitize the injuries. Just because the wound wasn’t fatal, doesn’t mean an infection in his blood wouldn’t be. I was meticulous in cleaning him and checking out the wound. I also had Coop go back and dispose of the motorcycle cut he was wearing. My hopes were that it would lead the Feral Kings to believe they had achieved their goal. I don’t know what kind of man this guy is, but I figure if he managed to piss off the Feral Kings, he must be better than they are. Of course, I can’t imagine too many could be as horrible as they are.



This guy had a patch on his jacket that said his name was Breaker. I’m pretty sure that’s not what is on his birth certificate. His cut also indicated he was a member of the Savage Brothers MC. I’ve never heard of them. Honestly, I don’t want to. When he recovers, he can leave here and go back to where he comes from. Hopefully, the Feral Kings will never know I helped him.



I let my gaze move over the man in question and sigh. I’m stupid for doing this. I’m putting not only myself in danger but also my daughter. I should have just walked away, but I couldn’t just let him die. He’ll live, although he will sport a nice scar on his chest. It’s above his heart. Whoever shot him was planning on killing him. There was enough blood that the bastard probably didn’t realize he missed. I was worried myself until I got Breaker’s shirt off.



My gaze moves to the man. It should be against the law to look as good as he does. Large, wide shoulders, tattoos lovingly inked over a physique that has to have been kissed by the gods. His long dirty blond hair makes my fingers itch, wanting to know how it would feel to run my fingers through it. There are these little lines around his eyes that make me wonder if he laughs and smiles often. His body is littered with scars, meaning the wound I sewed up today will have a lot of company.



“Did you hear me?”



My gaze moves back to Iva. “Sorry, I must have spaced.”



“I asked what I could do to help you get the room ready?”



I smile. “I think I have a wedge pillow to keep his upper body elevated. I may need Coop’s help to get the portable oxygen concentrator in the house. I’m also going to need some clothes for the guy.”



“We’re already on it. Although you may not like what I’m about to tell you.”



I turn to look at Iva, a frown on my face. “What do you mean?”



“Coop was worried about you being here alone with Tinny.”



“I’m not exactly helpless, Iva,” I grumble. I hate when people see me as weak. I let myself become that way after Tinny was born, but that’s not who I am. I’ll never be that way again.



“I know that, Indy. You may not realize this, but you’re family to us. So, Coop called in a couple of favors from some of his buddies in Blackstone.”



“The mercenaries?” I squeak.



“The ex-mercenaries. Might I remind you that my husband did that work, too?”



“I don’t care about that. It’s just …” I take a breath and then forget all about the confident, independent woman I always try to be for my daughter and admit the truth. “They’re kind of scary looking.” My voice comes out way too squeaky, but she lets me away with it.



“They’re sweet as pie,” she counters, making me laugh.



“I don’t think that saying means what you think it means, Iva.” I let out a sigh. “Let’s get moving. I’d like to get him settled in a room before Tinny gets home.”



“I’ll call my man to come do some heavy lifting and I can drool,” she jokes, making me laugh.



There may be things I hate about living here, but I couldn’t have better friends than Cooper and Iva. Me and my daughter really are blessed.



Chapter 2

Chapter 2



Breaker



“Don’t worry, big guy. You’re going to be just fine.”



Her voice.



It flows around me like warm water, reaching parts of me I didn’t even know were there. For a moment, I lose myself in the feeling. It doesn’t even matter that it’s not familiar at all. I’m positive I don’t know her. If I had heard this voice before, it would have been burned into my brain. It’s akin to molasses, smooth, thick, and clinging to me with a silky sweetness that I’d happily drown in. It makes me ache.



I struggle to open my eyes. I need to put a face to the voice. I want to see her. I try my best but can’t do it regardless of how hard I try. Darkness tries to overtake me, but I fight it. I need to look at this woman. It just isn’t familiar. Actually, nothing is.



Where am I?



I try to remember, but it’s like my mind is blank. I start to panic. This can’t be normal. My heart begins to beat erratically, getting faster and faster. There’s a mask on my face. Maybe oxygen? My nose burns. Am I in the hospital? Does that mean the voice belongs to a nurse or a doctor? Am I dying? Is that why I can’t open my eyes? She said I was going to be okay. Was she being honest or just telling me empty words to make me feel better? I try to concentrate so I can lift my eyelids. Somehow, I think if I can just see the woman behind the voice, I will feel better.



I feel her hand brush against my face. “Shh … Calm down. It’s going to be okay. I’ve given you some medicine to keep you relaxed so you can heal. You’ll be groggy and disoriented for a bit. Today, I’m going to start backing off it. You’ll be up and about in no time, but you need to take it easy. You’re lucky to be alive.”



Lucky to be alive.



The words keep repeating my mind. What the hell happened to me? The air around me doesn’t smell like a hospital. It’s a mixture of cherries and vanilla. Still, I’m definitely on oxygen. Plus, the woman said she gave me medicine. That would have to make her a doctor. I can feel the frustration mounting inside me. Then, once more, I feel a gentle hand slide against my forehead, fingers brushing into my hair. Almost instantly, I relax. It’s like her touch is magic.



“Mommy!” I hear a little girl yell. “Mommy!”



“Tinny, what did I tell you about running and screaming in the house?”



“Not to do it,” the girl announces proudly. If I could laugh, I definitely would right now.



“So, why are you doing it?”



“I’m sorry, Mommy. I was just excited. Uncle Cooper and Aunt Iva are going to take me into town for dinner. We’re going to have McDonald’s! Isn’t that cool? I’m going to get chicken nuggets,” she explains, barely pausing to breathe as she explains.



“Why are you going into town?” I hear the woman ask.



“We’re going to pick up the man Carson is sending to help you. Then we are all going to have dinner.”



“If you don’t mind, bring me back some food. I’m not choosey, but please, no nuggets.”



I hear the man laugh. I find myself jealous because he can see and talk to her, while I can’t.



“You got it, Indy.”



Indy. Her name finally registers, and I can feel my lips twitch as I try to smile.



“There’s money on the table by the door, Coop.”



“That means it’ll still be there after I’m gone,” the man responds. I wonder why it upsets me he’s buying her dinner. I can’t explain it, but it does.



“Dang it, Coop,” she huffs.



“Don’t fight me, Indy. I’m old and mean,” he says, but I can hear the unspoken laughter in his voice.



“If I don’t like this man you’re bringing me then he’s not staying, Coop.”



“Indy—”



“Tinny must like him too,” she warns. I’m trying to understand the conversation. Is he fixing her up with a man? Just the thought upsets me.



“Tinny likes everyone. You’ll like Jeff too. He’s a good guy. He just needs a place to heal.”



“I’m not a shelter for people with wounded souls, Coop. I have problems on my own.”



“Yeah, that’s why there’s a stranger in your guestroom, when most people around here would have just let him die.”



In her guestroom? Why would people leave me to die? What the fuck is going on here?



“You and Iva wouldn’t.”



“And that’s why we’re family. You’re just like us.”



There’s a moment of silence before I hear the little girl once more. “Come on, Uncle Coop, I want a happy meal!”



“We’re going sweet girl. I was just saying goodbye to your momma,” the man responds.



“What’s wrong with the pretty man, Mommy?” she asks as I feel her hand touch mine. Her touch feels sweet and soft—much like her mother’s.



“Pretty?” the man they call Coop laughs. Asshole. I hope he’s the woman’s brother. Either way, I think I’d like to hit the bastard—and I don’t even know why.



“Yeah. He’s got a really bad boo-boo. Mommy had to help him feel better. Mom? You kissed it and made it better with a Band-Aid, right?”



Her question makes me want to tease her mother. I really need to find a way to drag myself out of this darkness. Maybe then her mother would kiss me and make me feel better.



“Kind of,” she laughs. “But it was a really bad boo-boo. So, he still has to get better.”



I feel lips press against my hand. “There,” the little girl says. “I helped, too. He’ll be better now, Mom.”



“Yes, sweet girl, but remember, he’s a stranger, so I want you to stay away from him until me or Uncle Cooper talks to him to make sure it’s okay for you to be around him. Okay?”



“He’s not a bad man, Mommy. I can tell.”



“You’re still going to do as I ask, Tinny. Promise me.”



I hear the little girl let out a loud, exaggerated breath. “Okay,” she responds, sounding sullen. She’s not happy. Honestly, I’m not either. I don’t like them thinking that I would hurt the little girl, or her mother, for that matter. Is she afraid of me? Something about that doesn’t sit right with me at all.



“Good girl,” Indy says, her voice gentling.



“We’ll be back soon,” the man they call Cooper replies. “Keep your gun close.”



“I will,” she says.



This entire conversation is putting me on the edge. Why would they think I’d do anything to hurt Indy? Why do they think I’m a threat? I need to figure all this out, but the darkness keeps calling me. I finally give up, deciding to stop fighting. I really am tired. It’s taking all of my strength just to stay alert this long. I let the darkness pull me under, while wondering what Indy looks like. For some reason, I find myself hoping she’s a blonde. I have no idea why, but the thought that she might be makes me happy.



Chapter 3

Chapter 3



Indy



“Indy, this here is Jeff Ryan. He’s just signed on at the Blackstone Ranch.”



I smile at the man standing beside Cooper and Carson Wells. “Hey Jeff,” I murmur, with a friendly smile on my face. He’s tall and good-looking, with dark brown hair and matching eyes. He’s built like a man who has earned his muscles the hard way, working until he was worn and tired out in the hot sun. I look at him briefly, taking in his features. There’s a scar on his chest. It seems deeper, but most of it hides within a smattering of chest hair before completely disappearing under his white, black, and red checkered shirt. I can’t be sure, but it looks like a stab wound. Of course, if he’s working for Carson Wells, that stands to reason.



“Hey, Ms. Shelton.”



“Just Indy, please. Ms. Shelton was my mother, and I’d rather not be compared to her at all,” I respond with a wink, trying to lighten up the obvious stress he seems to be under. “Hey Carson, how have you been?” I’ve met this man a few times. I go out to the ranch for house calls regularly. Despite being guns for hire, Carson and his two brothers own a vast ranch. Cooper says that’s the majority of their focus these days and that they're retiring from the business, except for cases they feel action is justified and needed. I don’t ask questions. I respect them for what they do. I know it’s illegal, but I trust and know that Cooper is a good man. The less I know, the better I figure.



“Doing good. I’m going to need you to come out to the ranch as soon as you can. My new foal is acting funny. I’d hate to lose her.”



“How about tomorrow morning while Tinny is in school? Probably around nine thirty? You don’t want me before then. I have to have my coffee and wake up,” I explain. I know he is taking it as if I’m joking, but I’m not. I can’t deal with people without caffeine. It’s impossible.



“Sounds good. I’ll tell the boys at the gate to be expecting you.”



“Has Coop shown you around, Jeff?”



“Yeah, it’s a nice setup you have here, Indy. I’ve worked on a ranch since I was old enough to walk, so if you need help, you can count on me.”



“Thanks, Jeff, I appreciate that. I’ve been meaning to hire someone, but I’m just now getting my business built up enough to survive,” I laugh slightly. That’s kind of understating the struggle I’ve been having. I love this place and Bryson City is gorgeous. The truth is, however, in a small town, everyone knows one another. When it comes to vets, they tend to want to stick to people who have grown up here. I’ve had to severely undercut their prices just to start building a clientele. I’m making a profit, but it’s not what it should be—that’s for sure.



“You’re welcome. I figure I might as well be useful since you’re stuck with me.”



“I’m the one who should thank you. I’m sure babysitting a single mother, and her six-year-old inquisitive daughter isn’t what you’d choose willingly.”



“I’m good,” he says. I study him for a second while he talks with Cooper. I can see sadness in his eyes. There’s pain inside of him—a lot of it. I can tell because I’ve been there myself. I shake my thoughts away. My past still haunts me. I hope Jeff finds a way to escape his.



“Jeff, let me show you to the room you’ll be staying in,” I finally say.



“I can just stay out in the tack room or your office. I don’t need much,” he responds, sounding very uncomfortable.



“Nonsense. You’re here to protect us. You can’t do that in another building. Besides, there’s no one in this big old farmhouse except me and my daughter. There are plenty of bedrooms. I fixed one up last night beside my other guest. I figured that’d be easiest.”



“Actually, for at least the next couple of days, I’d rather be in the room with him. That way, I can make sure you and your daughter are safest. Once we establish that he’s not a threat, I’ll move into the other room. I can stay until he’s ready to move on.”



“I’m going to get his fingerprints, Indy. I’d feel better with a background check. If he’s in the system, I can get a name, date of birth and such.”



“I’m okay with that. He’s trying to wake up, though. I’ve started slowing down on the sedation meds. I was giving him some stuff to keep him from moving a lot and let his body heal. I’ve slacked off after he showed signs of coming around. So, if you’re going to do it, you better do it while you can. He may not be willing to give you permission otherwise.”



“Lead the way, Doc,” Carson says. I grin, shaking my head. I don’t exactly like having strangers in my house. There’s something about Jeff, however, that puts me at ease. I don’t know what he’s been through, but apparently pain recognizes pain, because I can tell just from the shadows in his gaze that he’s hurting as bad as I am—in places we never want others to see.



I head toward the house, wishing Breaker—or whatever his real name is—would wake up and go back to where he came from. I need my quiet life back.

1ls0kiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Grim_stories/comments/1ls0kiv/something_in_the_vents_at_work/,Something in the vents at work,"I work the night shift at an old rundown gas station off Interstate 40, the kind of place you only stop at when you’re desperate or you know lost. The type of store where the coffee tastes like dirt, and you still have to come inside to pay for gas. Most nights the lights inside buzz louder than the occasional car that drifts by. I’d say it’s Peaceful, if not for the constant hum of the old AC unit rattling the ceiling vents.

It started around 3 in the morning. Nothing good happens at 3 in the morning. I hadn’t had a single customer since midnight, and at least an hour since a car had passed by.

I’d just finished mopping the bathroom when I heard a scraping sound above me like nails dragging across sheet metal. I froze under the flickering fluorescent lights, mop still in my hand dripping onto the tile. It wasn’t the AC this time, I knew what that sounded like. It was all too familiar. This. This had rhythm. Like it was deliberate. Too heavy for a rat. Hell, it was too heavy for a raccoon.

I walked back behind the counter, trying to shake it off. Probably just loose fittings and the ducts came loose. Figured I’d just let the manger know in the morning. I turned the volume up on the radio. An old led zeppelin song was on and I tried to ignore the vent, but the noise didn’t stop. Instead, it got louder.

Now it was above the coffee station, then the snack aisle. Something crawling. I could hear its weight shift with each movement. Then a dull thump. Something dropped inside the vent. Something wet?

I grabbed the step stool and climbed up, and pulled the vent cover off to peek in.

It was pitch black. I  turned on my phones flashlight and pointed it into the duct. At first, nothing. Just dust and rust. Then I saw it. Something pulled back.

Not ran. Not scurried off. Pulled. Like it knew I was watching.

I stumbled back, heart pounding. The light flickered, as I slipped from the step stool. The ducts rattled. It was moving towards the vent and fast. I quickly climbed back up and slammed the vent shut, locking it back in place.

I called my manager. No answer. I called the police. Said it was probably just an animal and animal control wouldn’t be available to get out there for a few hours.

That thing’s still in there. I can hear it now. Breathing. I swear I heard it say my name and oh god the smell is unbearable.",2,1751686417.0,Grim_stories,0,1.0,False

(I’m also trying to go by an author name “Jack Morbid”, I may eventually try to find my other reddit account again with that name to avoid confusion with my future writing.

**Jack Morbid’s
The Mannequin Man**

Urban legends have terrorized the minds of people old and young for centuries, monsters of the mind manifesting in our nightmares and becoming our reality. These entities immortalized in our thoughts, the very same creatures that fuel our paranoia have thrived and adapted to our modern day era.

Some of these legends are more real than people realize. We aren’t alone in our world, enigmas of the earth hide in the shadows everywhere around us, just beyond the light we are gifted with every morning. There are entities in our world in every dark corner, beckoning those that cross their path to follow them into the abyss, where their victim can only pray that death is the only thing that happens to them.

Sometime in June of 2008 a mysterious video was posted to YouTube Titled “Mannequin Man”. It went so under the radar that it didn’t catch the public eye until three months after its initial upload. A 4chan user by the username of IpostCreepyStuff shared a link to the video on a random page of the site. The video itself was only forty one seconds long. It opened up on a very shaky shot of a dimly lit living room window revealing what appeared to be a front lawn with the censor lights on. Everything else outside was pitch black, so we could assume it’s sometime in the middle of the night or early morning.

Panicked breathing could be heard from behind the camera. Other than the faint sound of crickets the beginning of the video is eerily silent. After a couple of seconds a muffled low growl could be heard from outside, causing the person behind the camera to whimper. A moment later an unknown milky white lanky creature ran past the window on all four limbs at an inhuman speed, causing the person recording to scream and the video to cut out abruptly just as they turned to run.

The strange video left the 4chan community completely baffled. The origin of the video came from an uploader with the username JasonStar. Obviously this caught the attention of horror enthusiasts and the video began to spread like wildfire. With little to no answers of the video’s origin, the internet got to work on investigating the mysterious creature. When the audio is enhanced on the original video, around the thirty second mark when the creature is coming into view, the sound of metal screws squeaking could be heard when the creature moves its arms and legs. It’s as if it were some poorly constructed suit.

A YouTuber by the name of AshleyCunnings re-uploaded the video with the video brightness enhanced and color quality adjusted, it’s also zoomed in specifically on the creature. In this somewhat-sharper quality, it can be seen that the creature has very little to no muscle on its ultra-thin body, and it visually has no eyes or nose, but has a disturbingly wide mouth with teeth like a shark and a long dark pink tongue with much salvia flooding off of it. Oddly, it’s noted that the creature has no features on its skin rather than its pure white texture, and its feet look like that of a doll but with sharp edges where its toes should be.

The only other thing notable about the creature is its mannequin-like hands. They’re relatively small like that of an average person, but seem to have what looks like sharp fingernails that are covered in dirt and possibly blood. It’s theorized by the length of its legs that it could be around six feet tall. Displeased, many horror enthusiasts bashed the creature. They claimed it was some cheap knock-off of “The Rake” by some failing horror creator trying to gain any ounce of publicity; Though it did gain a moderate following of people trying to delve deeper into its mystery.

Weeks had gone by with the conspiracy theorists of the internet trying to put this case to rest. Nobody was really sure what to believe at the time, as there hadn’t been any other information to connect the video to. Eventually, someone finally spotted something in the video that extended the trail. Another YouTuber by the name of HorrorDebunked once again toyed with the video’s brightness and managed to see a street sign in the background. It was very blurry from the quality, but it was believed the sign said “Koontz St”. Many people began searching for this street sign all over the net. The only theory people were able to come up with was that the road was possibly somewhere around Pennsylvania.

Sightings and articles began rising all over the net about this creature that the world had dubbed “Mannequin Man”. From what everyone could gather from all these sightings and little pieces of information, the Mannequin Man was a nocturnal creature that made its presence known in 2008, behind that no other records have been found. It’s thought that with its intense speed that the Mannequin Man does not reside in one area, but constantly travels to different areas as it hunts. Notable locations it has been sighted have been various places around Miami Florida, Phoenix Arizona and Bakersfield California.

It’s theorized by these places that The Mannequin Man is warm blooded and survives in the extreme heat. It has never been spotted outside the U.S. or anywhere too cold. From other various data collected from sightings, it’s theorized that the lowest temperature the creature could hunt in is sixty degrees. Though it prefers higher, hotter temperatures.

The musk of their scorching prey, their flesh cooked by the sun and the salty sweat to make them taste extra juicy make humans not only easy to track, but an enticing meal. Allegedly, a mysterious internet chain letter started a rumor that the Mannequin Man is known to only hunt women between 18-24 years of age. While for men the alleged victims have been 16-30 exactly. The message went on to claim that the creature is selective with its prey’s age range because human meat is the freshest in a person’s youth, making it the best food to hunt. The eerie message concluded that if you did not send this message to twenty people by six a.m., you’d be the Mannequin Man’s next victim.

With no more clues left to investigate, the video and the creature within it finally began to die down. The trail had gone cold and people had finally started to forget about the morbid entity, until two months later on the night of August 24th.

Twenty four year old Erica “French-Vanilla” Rose had gone missing after not coming home from work, she was reported missing around 7:15 am the next day by her dad David Crowley. Erica and her father had lived alone, after her mother died in a drunk driving accident a few years prior. She had changed her last name to Rose, in honor of her mother. Erica hadn’t had a significant other and she was helping her father pay the bills. Her nickname stemmed from her friends, saying she always had a French Vanilla coffee in her hand.

Erica had been working at the coffee shop “Hot Stuff” and was to close up that night. At about seven a.m. the next morning, one of the managers named John Dean came to open up shop, but was baffled to see it was never closed the previous night. Upon entering for further inspection, he found a horrifyingly macabre scene near the emergency exit.

A pool of now dirty blood was on the floor, and spattered behind it was a trail leading right to the exit. Now, this caught my attention. I wasn’t one to get mixed up in other people’s affairs. Due to my anxiety I always sat back on the sidelines my whole life. I wanted to be useful at least once. So, I did something I would never usually do. When a search party was being formed, I volunteered. I thought maybe I could do something useful and good for someone else and my community. I was a slave to anxiety my whole life. So for once I decided to be the one in control and do something good for someone else while getting out of my house for the first time in months.

Six days of searching lead to little clues, and hope dwindled for her widowed father. On the final day, something alarming happened. Near Erica’s house just off the road was a patch of woods that leads to a small river. The sun was low in the sky and the clouds were dark. Nothing was right anymore, the whole neighborhood was on edge. Kids were beginning to spread stories, nobody was staying out late anymore.

The police finally decided that we should all do a small search in those woods. I felt my paranoia was up to its old tricks again, but I swallowed hard and with a heavy sigh I carried on. My heart slowly began to pick up the pace as we trudged into the woods. It was truly one of the eeriest moments in the case.

There was a slight chill in the air, an invisible unease within the search party so thick that the air around them felt compressed and pressurized. Smothering everyone with each heavy bated breath. The woods were agonizingly quiet, yet somehow every little sound felt amplified as the darkness began to overthrow the comfort of the lessening light.

The coming darkness began to make us feel boxed in, surrounding us like a pack of hungry wolves circling its prey, stalking their every move. Paranoia was tugging at every man and woman in the party like a leech sucking the blood of its host. Proving its dominance and provoking weakness and fear as the absence of light became more and more evident.

My group gradually began to feel smaller as the woods felt like they were growing and becoming more hostile as we transversed deeper into unknown territory. Sharply turning our flashlights at every sound, hearts racing. Truthfully, I even began to hope no new evidence would be found here, in fear of what we might’ve stumbled upon. I think the others felt the same way. Nobody said a word but we could tell that we were all thinking the same thing.

Everyone wanted to leave, especially me. My anxiety was rising, I didn’t want to be there anymore than they did, but the thought of leaving a helpless person to rot didn’t sit right with me. I was tired and nauseous, but determined. My stomach was swirling and burning with intense nervousness. I hated it out in the woods. I was looking hard at all my surroundings as much as my vision would allow in the dark. When someone snapped me out of my trance.

“Up there! In the trees!” one of the members shouted with fear in their voice.

One by one, beams of light chased after each other, looking for whatever was causing one of the members distress. Confusion and anxiousness slipped into my head as my eyes followed the bright beam of my flashlight.

Her eyes were the first thing I saw as they met mine. Unblinking, Erica’s head hung upside down as she was laying on her back, her spine nearly Making a perfect horseshoe. She stared into my eyes with silent agony. It wasn’t on her face, but her eyes spoke when her voice no longer could.

They had looked wide, terrified at the revelation that they were going to die. She knew these were her last few moments on this earth. She knew she couldn’t stop it, and the only thing she felt was petrified. Her skin was black and blue, her lips bloated and a deep purple. The color had faded from her eyes, and there were dry lines running down her cheeks from where she had been crying. Her mouth hung agate, as if she was struggling to let out one last agonizing scream for help.

Dry blood stained the branches and the leaves growing among them. Her stomach had been impaled on a sharp branch, bits of flesh breaking off on edges of the branch and tearing off Erica’s body. To my horror, I felt bile rise from my stomach as a realization hit me, all we found was her torso. Her rib cage had deep bite mark wounds on both sides.

So many thoughts began to run through my head. I felt so much sympathy for this poor girl. When the body dies, the brain keeps functioning for seven minutes. In those seven minutes, people feel everything. They’re very aware they are dying, and they lose all sense of time. So the seconds begin to feel like decades, an endless infinite number of years filled with pain and agony, unaware of when they will finally be granted death. Part of me wondered if that’s what Erica went through in her final moments, I hate to think that she suffered.

Who was going to look David in the eye and tell him we found his daughter torn in half from the waist down?

I replay the events as they unfolded in my head, over and over. I can’t stop picturing her face, staring down at me from the trees. Every night I’m haunted by nightmares of finding her lifeless corpse. The lower half of her intestines hanging out of her waist, intertwined and draped over the branches like vines. I’d wake up almost every night in a cold sweat, before realizing I’m safely back in my bed.

Over the weeks I began to almost regret being a part of the search party. Ever since that night my anxiety has crippled me and my day to day life. I eventually decided to get myself into therapy to talk about that night in the woods. The last few nights have been a little better recently, and I’ve slowly gotten better about dealing with my anxiety.

The memories of that night still occasionally resurface in my mind, but I try my best not to dwell on it. Still though, I had never seen so many teeth in a bite mark before.",1,1751686396.0,stories,1,0.99,False

Salaam everyone! I can’t really talk to anyone else about this so I’m coming to Reddit for advice lol. I met this guy (actually on Reddit) and he’s been super nice. I feel like we get along well and our conversations can go from deep, important conversations to lighthearted conversations about our day. I feel like he could be the one but the only thing is he lives 1.5-2 hours away. 

I know in retrospect it may not seem like a big deal but I’m really close to my family. I live like 2 minutes away from my grandparents and I always try and spend time with them whenever I can. I feel like if I make the move, I’d be homesick and just miss my grandparents the most. 

I know I can drive back and forth that’s not a big issue I’m just worried about missing the small things. Impromptu chai and coffee dates, taking them shopping or to appointments. Just little things like that. What should I do? Wait for another possible match or take the risk? Jzk for any and all advice.

Hey lovelies 🌻 !

It’s been a while since I had a close female friend, the kind you could vibe with over coffee, take random hobby classes with, or just talk about life after a long day. College and early work days had that magic, but as we grow older, friendships get harder to build.

I’m in my late 20s, figuring out the next leap in life. I work in tech, love what I do, and I’m in a happy long-distance relationship. I’ve also reached that phase where personal hobbies and growth >> house parties and clubbing (though the occasional and well deserved one doesn’t hurt 😄).

I’d love to connect with like-minded women in Hyderabad who are open to:
	•	Exploring the city together
	•	Joining hobby classes (fitness, spirituality, art, dance, ANYTHING !)
	•	Weekend catchups
	•	And most importantly, forming a real, lasting friendship

If this sounds like you, drop me a message or comment here. Let’s make the city feel a little warmer and less lonely.

It’s better to be a simp, or someone in the friend zone for a girl you can spoil here and there without any expectations from her. None of these expectations of “sessions” or whatever. This way you will avoid falling into a relapse. 

And eventually, you will learn to appreciate women without feeling the need to provide something to them. Slowly decrease over time the amount of times you send and spend. Learn to value yourself. And make irl female friendships. Then move onto a relationship. 

This is a way I think is very rational and safe. At least personally for me. As I have found that I enjoy being a simp more than a “sub”.

早上好

it's almost March 2022, and thanks to fruitless investment activities we're not discussing the possibilities mentioned in this magazine with a cup of coffee | green tea while enjoying to nature.

It's Spring, Thumbs Up.



The ability to manufacture infrastructure & hardware in space has the potential to have a profoundly transformative impact.

\#OnOrbitManufacturing, requires small payloads, and will lead to larger infrastructure components (e.g. antennae reflectors, solar arrays, radiators) thereby enabling higher performance, higher power and lighter structures, while reducing the launch costs. 

Such capability will definitely lead to novel servicing and maintenance logistics, including eventually repair and recycling of spacecraft parts, lifetime extension and new business models for space assets. Moreover, the dependence on cargo missions and the amount of supplies to be carried from Earth will be reduced dramatically.

Budgie's #OffEarthManufacturing offers features for #InSpaceManufacturing namely:

unlimited geometry feature, design \*almost anything; 

unlimited materials type feature, use \*almost any material; 

unlimited environment feature, build \*almost anywhere.

I was getting married and promoted at work the same day (coincidence). Everything I had worked so hard for was coming together, all at once. Unfortunately I have a humiliation fetish, so when the coffee hit in the morning I chose... voluntarily... to shit myself right there in my slacks and just head to work. My co workers tried futilely to be polite. My manager refrained from mentioning the smell and visible stain on my clothes for about 2 minutes, seemingly giving me a chance to explain myself. I just reveled in all their looks of confusion, then frustration and finally: judgement. Theyre understanding people with whom I had a good reputation. If it were an accident, I would have been fine. They saw through my wretched smile dilated pupils that it was no accident, and only then was there a serious problem. I was asked not to return to the office, and I got what I wanted, so I complied...

I went straight to church where I was to be married that same evening. My groomsmen met me first as I was to prepare.

Full of the same hot shit that stayed with me throughout this entire great day--9 hours at this point, in the above-90 degree summer heat. My friends asked what was wrong with me.

They scrambled amongst themselves, desperate to figure out how to get me ""back to normal"" before it was too late. I told them, this is the real me. This is my normal. They stayed behind as the ceremony began, and I went alone into the chapel to meet my beautiful wife down the aisle. Now pockets of chatter and muffled gasped opened with each row of seating I walked past. Like all the others, my guests initially found themselves paralyzed with shock and confusion, which allowed me to male my way to my bride uninterrupted. She smiled, tears in her eyes. A expression made only more exquisite as it twisted its way to a shock and horror greater than any other treasured reaction I had claimed the whole day prior. The stages of confusion to anger and rejection progressed more rapidly and more intensely than any previous specimen. ""I shit myself,"" I simply said. She slapped me in the face and ran fast enough out of the building to break one of her $400 heels. It didnt slow her down, indeed I wouldnt have even noticed had the adrenaline and dopamine rushing through my body not granted me such profound abilities of perception. Abilities which allowed me to engrave each moment of this precious day into my memory, forever. This is what I had worked so hard for...",0,1751685409.0,offmychest,1,0.11,False

I've just ordered using Numan, with one of the discount codes on here, but I don't want to be paying the full £200 every month when it's usually much cheaper, so will probably change after that, so when you change do you have to do all the pictures again? If I change and show that I've done the first dosage already, will they let me move up at the new pharmacy to 5?

Also, realistically what kind of results can I expect from the first couple of months? I'm. 194cm (6'4) and 167kg (26.1 stone), not very active, don't really eat a lot, but sugar is probably my weak point with teas, coffees and drinks in general.

I’m a convert, but became PIMO when the church became so much for me that I made a plan for myself to leave earth and to take my kids with me. I sought help professionally, but never could be anything but PIMO for years. I thought it would keep my kids “safe” from the world until 2 suffered mentally from being in the church. The kids and I are all out and are thriving. We found a Protestant congregation that has been good for us. My kids have grown so much. They’ve gone from being too terrified to speak in church to actively participating. Once we had to take a weekend trip because my daughter’s social anxiety was so bad they couldn’t speak in church, but they were told all youth had to speak for this special youth Sunday. They wouldn’t take no for an answer so we went on a trip. I also had a bishop tell me when I was YW president to talk to the girls about how even some of their modest dresses allow him to look down their dresses when he is on the stand and to please be aware of that when choosing clothing because it is a sexual distraction for him. That grossed me out. There are many other crazy stories over several wards (we moved a lot). My final straw was when my full paying tithe disabled friend was denied financial help when she and her kids needed to leave her abusive, adulterous husband. She was told they would have to witness the abuse. Then when her husband asked for help they took him shopping but wouldn’t get razors for the girls, 3 in 1 shampoo, conditioner, body wash (only shampoo), spam or gluten free items (for the family member who had a legit medical reason) because they were considered luxury items. About 9 months after my last Sunday in an LDS church (where only one person spoke to me to criticize what I was wearing) I was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer. Some of my RS “sisters” murmured that this was my wake up call to come back to church. I begged the bishop to release my husband from his tiny calling so he could focus on me. The bishop insisted on a visit and commented how bad I looked. Then he prayed that I would “find joy” in this journey (of having cancer). My husband reached over to put his hand on my leg because I think he knew my instinct was to leap over the coffee table and slap him. The bishop refused to release my husband. There were Sunday mornings where I was sick as a dog but my husband was trying to fulfill his calling. It fell on my son to care for me and solidified in him that the church wasn’t true. He has sent a letter requesting his records be removed. Fighting cancer (and winning!) was easier than being in the church. I had SO much support from my friends in the community and in my new congregation. I never went to chemo alone. We had lots of meals and other supports. Anything from the LDS was either conditional (demanding a visit before dropping off a meal) or half-assed (bringing one entree from a Chinese restaurant to feed my family of 5). Boundaries were not respected by my LDS “sisters and brothers”. When my white blood cells tanked, they would try to visit. When I had surgery, was bald and very sick, two members kind of pushed their way in with my sister (not LDS) who had flown in to care for me to drop off a meal. One then looked in at me to see me. I was faking sleeping but did NOT want anyone to see me without my cap on or without being fully dressed. My son and daughter are about to be baptized into our new congregation. My husband is consenting because he can see how much happier me and the kids are, but he says he will never leave…but sees some discrepancies…if he never leaves I’m fine with it, but I think he may once he sees all of the issues. I’ve talked to him about possibly being encouraged to divorce me when I officially leave the LDS church and join my new congregation. He doesn’t think they will but says he will tell the bishop that they are wrong to suggest it. My husband is fiercely loyal to me and the kids. I really don’t think he will leave us. If he did, that is his choice and I would be ok financially. There is so much more, but I’ll leave it at that for now!",7,1751685182.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

Daily good mornings. Voice messages. Video calls. After-work coffee dates. Gusto mo ng malambing? He gave that. Gusto mo ng space? He respected it.

So easy to think na “baka ito na.”

I don’t remember what I said after that.

I haven’t replied to him since.

Now he’s spamming.
“Are you okay?”
“Bakit parang ang cold mo?”
“Did I do something?”
You did.
You made me feel like I was safe — then turned me into a group chat inside joke.

Sana fake ‘yung mga messages.
Sana may iba silang tinutukoy.
Sana may excuse ka that’ll make this pain make sense.

And it’s ugly.
And humiliating.

All she had to do was pay her flight to Tana, money for souvenirs and the rest of the trip was covered. We arrived late on Monday and were scheduled to fly the next morning on a charter flight that only operates once weekly to a remote location in the north. Tuesday to go, Saturday morning to return. Then the plan was to spend Saturday and Sunday in the capital before heading south for 3 days. I woke us up 45 minutes before the car was scheduled to take us to the airport. For some reason, she had, the night prior, decided to completely unpack and reorganize her luggage. (shrug emoji).

I'm pretty low maintenance, 15 minutes to shower, brush my teeth and hair and then good to go. I walked to the lobby and was giddy over my morning coffee. I was in freakin' Madagascar, the top of my bucket list wish trips and heading to Tsingy de Namoroka national park. Squee!

About 10 minutes before we were scheduled to leave, I went back to the room where my friend was rushing around trying to get things together. I asked if I could help and she snapped at me that I was just distracting her.

Finally, we made it down to the waiting car and were on our way about 15 minutes late. We got to the airport. We were restricted to one 20kg bag and so the luggage was minimal. As we were about to board the flight, my friend realized that she left her zoom camera lens at the hotel. I told her that we would be staying at the same hotel when we returned and she could get it then but she didn't want to go on this leg without it so she took a taxi back to get it despite my concern that she didn't have time.

Well, she missed the flight and i decided to go without her. This was a once in a lifetime trip for me and i had saved YEARS (26k USD) to go. I would never have another opportunity.

When I returned to Tana, we met up again and I found out that she spent the last 4 nights sleeping at the airport because she didn't want to spend money on a hotel because ""you told me that you'd cover all that"".

Long story short, the rest of our trip was miserable. She was resentful that I abandoned her and sucked the enjoyment out the rest of our time in Anosy and Tana.

Now that we've returned, our friend group has sided with her and told me that it was outrageous that i left without her and that i should have stayed so that we could be together. I tried to explain that i had told her that she didn't have time to return to the hotel and that i had already paid for the flights and the camp that we were staying at. If i had stayed it would have cost me hundreds of dollars for new lodging AND i would have missed half of my planned trip experience.

I have become a pariah in our friend group. They all tell me that I was selfish and placed my friend in danger by abandoning her in a foreign country.

I know that everyone loves this and definitely reads this paragraph :D I started writing this script because I couldn't really find anything like it. Who knows, maybe I just didn't look hard enough. However, this scripts is based off of me, so I hopefully my personality and little quirks can resonate with some people. I never really see people play around with the needy person providing comfort, and it was a bit of a challenge to try and bring it to life. This is also my first script that I've written in a while, so hopefully I didn't do too bad. 

Rules - If you use this script, please credit my Youtube, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/@BoyfriendGooseASMR). Any modifications are completely fine. If you do decide to fill this, please comment your fill. I wanna see my creation come to life heheh >:) Posting on Youtube, Patreon, etc. is fine as long I have access to fills somehow.

Author notes - I wanted to do something that wasn't typically what you would see me do. I tried stepping a bit outside of my comfort zone, and I'd like to think that I did okay. Originally, it was going to be a VA speaker, but people in my community seem to have a thing for gamer boys (lucky me :D). If I ever got mad at a girlfriend, I would be doing everything in my power to apologize. This is a (pretty heavily) watered down version of that. I am a golden retriever, thank you very much. Thank you to both Rin and Lyu for helping me with ideas for the ending. Very cool :D

Listener summary - You just got home, and you find your \[boyfriend/girlfriend/SO\] playing some ranked games on \[Valorant, any other shooter\], and not in bed with you? What a crime! They'll have to win back your heart before (and after) you forgive them.

Speaker summary - You get home before your SO and hop on some sort of PVP game (in my mind it's Valorant but it can really be anything), and get a bit mad at them for interrupting your ranked match. Feeling horrible, you abandon mid-game and calm them down until you both fall asleep.

(listener walks in on speaker playing video games) \[Angry, yelling if you want\] No, he's on the right! Jesus, are you deaf? Please, for the love of God, listen to your teammates' comms. Jesus!



\[Still a bit of anger leftover in your voice, slowly fades out\] Oh, hey baby, what's up?



Yeah, I'm just playing a few games, and then I'll join you in bed. Is that alright?



\[Concerned\] ...Baby? Why aren't you saying anything?



Did something happen at work? What's going on?



If nothing happened, then why aren't you talking to me? Did I do something wrong?



\[Tired of clinginess\] Yeah? What did I do wrong?



All I wanted to do was play a few games. I just got home from work, and I want to take a break.



I hang out with you all the time as soon as I get home. Surely not hanging out with you for one day doesn't mean that much. We always have tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that...



\[Kinda fed up\] Listen, I will get to bed in a second. I'm in the middle of my rank up game, and I don't need you in my ear right now.



(listener starts crying/gets upset)



\[Back to worried\] Okay, you know that's not what I meant... Baby, no, where are you going? (optional footsteps as they leave the room)



(to teammates, slight pause in between each line) Alright, I'm gonna go. No, I don't care. There's a more important matter on my hands right now, so just, give me a second. I'm not fucking asking, give me a second, okay?



(back to listener) Baby? Are you in here?



Are you under the covers?



Well, I'm pretty sure that blankets can't talk on their own. (sits on bed beside them)



\[Soft voice for basically the rest of the script\] Listen, I get that you're angry, and you have every right to be mad at me right now, but I want to talk to you. It doesn't mean that you have to talk back, just listen for a little while, okay?



Listen, I'm sorry for what I said back there. You know I didn't mean it, right? I love your voice. I love getting to hang out with you. I love coming home and spending time with you after a long day.



Recently, I've been under a lot of pressure from work. Supporting both of us meant that I started picking up extra shifts at work, and they just keep increasing my workload. I didn't want to tell you because I knew you'd worry, and I didn't want to stress you out.



No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one who should be sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you like that. It was rude and you didn't do anything wrong.



No, I don't count that. If you're in the habit of hanging out with me right as I get back from work, then it'd be only fair to think I'd do the same today too.



I'm sorry, baby. I really am. I know how needy you are, and I love that about you. God, I wouldn't know what to do if you thought that I was too clingy. But, I don't think I've been doing the best when it comes to meeting your needs, hmm?



So, I've got an idea. You and me, right now. For the rest of the night, we do whatever you want. 



What ranked game? I quit. Sure, my team might be a bit mad at me, but I'd much rather them be mad at me than you. 



My rank? Who cares? I have you, and that's better than any rank I could ever achieve. 



Yes, I mean it. You're like, a power up. There's no way I would be able to take on this much work if I didn't have you waiting at home for me. 



Now that I've poured out my heart to you, do you think that you could find it in yours to forgive me? You know just as well as I do that neither of us can sleep properly without the other at this point.



(They come out from underneath the blanket)



I knew that there was something under those covers. It turns out, it was the prettiest person I've ever seen.



So, what do you want to do, now that you've returned from the blanket dimension? 



Cuddles? Yeah? Come on, I know you want to. Come nuzzle into my chest, baby.



No, I like it. It's a reminder of you whenever I have to travel for work. Sleeping on call with you can hold me over, but it's not nearly as good as the real thing.



You know something? What I regret saying the most right now? That I didn't want to hear your voice. Do you know how much I love your voice? God, I could listen to you all day. Do you know how many times I've thought of calling off of work just to listen to you talk? I love when I finally get home and I'm able to hear you talk about what you did that day, how you're doing, or literally anything else. And don't think for a second that you don't have a nice voice, because that is an absolute lie. I know how you think, baby.



And your hair. I know I didn't say anything about it, but, like, how could I? It always looks amazing, no matter what. I've seen you intentionally try and make it look bad and fail. The way that it flows so perfectly. It always smells like you just washed it too, and I have no clue how you do that.



And your eyes. They're literally endless. I space out in the middle of the conversations because I can't pull myself away from them. The way that you can pull me by doing literally nothing should honestly be studied.



And your personality, too. The way that you care so deeply for me, and always find some way to make me feel better. The amount of times you've lifted me to heights I never knew I could reach are countless, and I have you to thank for every single time.



And just how pretty you look. Every time I look at you, I feel like I'm dating a supermodel.



I love you, you know that? More than bees love pollen, more than Peter Parker loves Mary Jane, more than anything else in the world. I love you so, so much, and I'm so sorry that I don't tell you that enough. I really should tell you that more, huh? I just hope that my actions can sponge up some of my inactivity.



Uh, don't try hide to hide it. I can see you giggling. 



So... I almost forgiven? 



Still not talking to me, huh? Either way, I just want you to know that I meant everything I said. I wasn't saying them just so you wouldn't be mad at me anymore. I love you, you know that? I don't want you staying mad at me forever. 



At least I can finally see your smile, and that's all I need. For now, I'll probably need you to cuddle me like for the rest of the night.



Buttttt, I still think I should apologize even more, so I'm going to clear my schedule for tomorrow, we're going to do anything you want to do. For the whole day. How does that sound?



Good? Good. Do you have anything in mind?



Yep, anything you say. We can go to those places, and then maybe stop for coffee and a few snack in between.



God, you're so excited. I love it when you talk so much.



I promise, we'll do everything.



But, for now, let's try to get some rest, okay? Neither of had the best day, but that's alright. We always have tomorrow, and we need rest to do all things you've planned for us.

This has to be worth it right???? After subtracting the cost of the nespresso vertuo plus machine from the order total (381 - 68$ \[assuming tax\] = 313 --> 313/360 = 86 or 87) 

So 87 cents per vertuo DE pod as opposed to the 1.35 cents per pod. Or by 26$ per 30 count!

This deal ends july 6th, it'll probably come back sooner or later....? 

but if you don't have a nespresso machine take this chance or just be on the lookout for this type of deal!!",2,1751683995.0,nespresso,4,1.0,False

I want to share something that might be one of the first real-world consumer rights cases being driven with ChatGPT’s help — and we’re just getting started.

A few days ago, I paid for a 3-month subscription to the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel. Almost immediately after the payment went through, my account was permanently banned without warning or explanation. Support refused to provide any details, denied a refund, and referenced vague “Terms of Service” violations.

It felt like a scam — and I was about to give up.

But then I turned to ChatGPT for help. What followed surprised me:

	•	It helped me write a formal refund request and appeal letter
	•	Walked me through my legal rights under the Digital Services Act (I’m currently in the EU)
	•	Helped me draft strategic Reddit replies to find others who experienced the same
	•	Showed me how to preserve evidence, deal with subreddit mod abuse
	•	Most importantly: it gave me the clarity, structure, and emotional support to stay focused and fight back with professionalism

We’re now gathering more victims, documenting evidence, and preparing to escalate together. If this leads to a refund, public accountability, or even legal action — this might be the first consumer case empowered and coordinated by ChatGPT in the wild.

It’s not just ChatGPT helping me — it’s us, using tools like this to push back when companies cross the line.

If you’re reading this and feel like a platform has wronged you — don’t stay silent. Use the tools you have. Organize. Document. Ask for help.

And to CMB or any other platform watching — we’re not afraid, and we’re not alone anymore.

Thanks for reading. I’ll keep you updated on what happens next.

1lrzv5a,https://i.redd.it/sr0k1u38zyaf1.jpeg,Summary - Moomin (1969) Episode 17-18,"Episode 17: Where is a Baby?

Moominpappa was scolded by Moominmamma for lying down and drinking coffee in bed. She then pointed out that Moomin now was copying him. Seeing their parents looking at him, Moomin accidentally spilled his coffee on his bed sheet. Moomin was embarrassed that now his sheet had to be hung dried outside with a big brown stain. He now guarded the sheet and would explain to anyone passing by that the stain was in fact coffee. Mr. Muskrat walked passed as Moomin went in to explain himself, but Mr. Muskrat could not care less. Distracted, Little My got a hold of the sheet and took it away. She threatened to tell Snorkmaiden about it unless he got her a baby sister. Unsure of how to get a baby for her, he talked to Sniff where he mentioned about a myth of a stork delivering a baby. Moomin went out on a hill to catch a stork but was made fun of by Snork and Snorkmaiden. Humiliated, Snorkmaiden came to comfort and told him about the wishing lake. Moomin later traveled to the lake in the forest. He wished for a baby and offered a bottle cap in return. He soon found a crying baby in a stroller nearby. Thinking that the wish had come true, he took the baby back to Little My. She was pleased and now nursed the baby like her own. Moomin walked out happy and then discussed about the wishing lake with Snorkmaiden, they found Little My taking the baby in a stroller but she changed the direction upon seeing the two for she wished to not be disturbed. While asking about the baby, Little My accidentally led go of the stroller and it rolled down hill, Moomin saved the baby in the nick of time. In a meantime, Moominpappa came across a crying mother who had her baby kidnapped so he took her to the police station. The mother notified that she found a strange backpack left near the lake, that backpack turned out to belong to Moominpappa. Later in the day, Moomin and Snorkmaiden fantasized about them having babies as well so they went to the lake and wished for them yet nothing happened. Moominpappa, the mother and the inspector came to the lake and apprehended them.

They all went to Mymble's house to confront Little My. The baby now cried and wanted to go back to the real mother. For some time, Little My refused to give up the baby but eventually returned the baby to the rightful mother. At night, she hugged her doll longingly and broke down. It was that she always wanted a younger sister to play with. Moomin asked Snufkin of what to do as he felt bad for Little My. The next day, Moomin pretended to be a baby on a stroller for Little My. Snork who drove passed them was disgusted by Moomin's action pretending to be a big baby and drove off. Little My then left and walked Moomin through the hill path.

Episode 18: I Want to Become a Beggar / I Already Got Tired of the Rich Person

A plane was seen flying above Moominvalley causing a lot of noise pollution to the villagers. Moomin and Little My followed the plane and investigate. The plane later airdropped wooden crates and then a man parachuted down into the forest. The villagers leaded by Snork, Sniff, Mymble, Mr. Hemulen, the Inspector and Mr. Muskrat also came to investigate and found lots of gold coins in the crates, they then suspected that it might be a smuggling operation. Moomin and Little My found the man as he then asked them a series of questions. He then gave away his gold coins for those who answered him correctly. Moomin brought home the coins and were scolded by his parents. Moominpappa went out to confront the man but he also attempted to give Moominpappa gold as well. The man then followed Moomin and Moominpappa home and then revealed that he was a self-made successful business man.

In the past, he was an orphan living off the street, he worked as a shoe-shiner to earn a living. As time passed, he worked hard and eventually became a successful person. Now, he got tired and wanted to start his life anew once again and that was the reason why he was giving his wealth away. Moomin then helped him giving away the gold coins but no one in Moominvalley wanted them. They went to Snork as he also found out who the man was, he was a cut-throat business man who came to Moominvalley with a malicious intent for no one in the right mind would give their wealth away for free and not wanting anything in return. Not wanting to associate with them, he dragged Snorkmaiden into the house. Later, Snorkmaiden broke out and suggested Moomin and the Business Man to do some fair exchange instead of giving the rich away. Moomin and the Business Man then went around exchanging some broken junks from the villagers. Successfully giving away the gold, they spotted a plane airdropping more gold crates. It was Snork who ruined their plan by contacting the company for him.

Moomin went back to confront Snork but the Business Man soon realized that there were a lots of people who depended on him back in his company. He then decided to return and not bothered the people in Moominvalley anymore. Moomin shook hand with him and waved goodbye as his helicopter picked him up and flew away.

Translator Note

\- In this version, Little My seems to have no siblings rather than the Mymble whom likely did not spend enough time with her. It's an odd contrast for the Mymble family in other version to have abundant of children. Also Little My in v1990 seems to hate children more than she likes them, a big interesting contrast.

\- Despite Mymble not being around for Little My in this episode, she is often seen being around in this version a lot more than any other version as well.

\- Episode 18 is a mirrored episode of v1990 Episode 27: Aunt Jane.

\- The Business Man was likely to live in London, England.

\- There a scene of Sniff confronted Moomin and the Man trying giving coins away but he never asked for any himself. He could have taken it all if it was him for another version.

I’m 31, currently wrapping up a role as a National Account Manager in the food and drink industry in the UK. I’ve got two job offers on the table, both with solid potential, but in very different ways, and I’m torn.



Option 1: Head of Wholesale at a fast-growing, values-led drinks brand
	•	£60k base salary (+ £6k “car allowance,” not tied to owning a vehicle but will have to bused for any train ticket or car rental)
	•	15% annual bonus (non-performance linked)
	•	It’s a big step up in scope and seniority, I’d be owning wholesale nationally
	•	The company’s founder and team have been incredibly supportive and emotionally intelligent throughout the process, they’ve reassured me about the learning curve, and they genuinely seem invested in my long-term growth (talk of becoming a Director/shareholder eventually)
	•	That said, the product category is entirely new to me. I’d be learning from scratch, stretching beyond my current expertise
	•	It excites me, but I’m scared it could be too big a leap and that I might not be ready

Option 2: Senior National Account Manager at a well-established coffee-related brand
	•	£65k base salary
	•	Uncapped quarterly bonuses tied to performance
	•	I know this space well, I’ve been in coffee for years, I have strong contacts, and I’d be able to deliver results early
	•	More financially rewarding in the short term and with way less of a learning curve
	•	Feels emotionally “safer,” solid, steady growth in a space I know
	•	But potentially less long-term upside in terms of career acceleration

One role is in my comfort zone. The other is outside of it.

Both teams seem genuinely great. The first is more forward-thinking, mission-driven, and invested in personal development. The second is proven, structured, and more performance-based in terms of rewards.

Extra context: I eventually want to run my own business or acquire small businesses to grow and run myself. I’m trying to figure out which role would better support that vision, in terms of learning, positioning, headspace, and financial runway.


Has anyone here faced a similar choice? Or moved out of their niche and into a new category successfully?

I was never popular in school at all, I was always an outcast as I was shy, didn’t live in the right area or was seen as weird by them. Anyway this came with constant bullying which was extremely damaging to my self esteem. I also realised I was bi and was mocked constantly for this. I feel I never had the typical fun experience as nothing happened apart from bullying, damage to my self esteem and toxic friends. I was lonely, so I befriended a girl who my mum knew her mum and she was very toxic. My mum was genuinely nice at home and would help the best she could, my dad however could be quiet nasty when he wanted to be or said things that he didn’t mean, which caused lasting damage. She would be love bombing me to then turn on me and bash me like I was worthless. During the time, I went very emo (still am) and had a love for English literature, I still do and wanted to be a writer.

I left school and went to college (16-18 years old in the UK). I took the wrong subjects and made a mess of college. I guess I felt I should go with what seemed easy instead of what I was good at, which led to no interest in the subjects and me dropping out or getting bad grades. My friend ( the toxic one ) she like abused me badly even more as we got older, she got into legal trouble and it got to the point I had to cut her off. Some of my other friends were slightly scared of her and therefore joined her, so I was left with no friends. I had a few decent friends from other courses or other things I did but they was very surface level and didn’t last past college. At this time, I had came out to my mum as bisexual and whilst she reacted good, I couldn’t stop doubting due to comments she made in the past and constantly replayed this in my head to the point I would argue with her or have mini cry spells over it. 

The summer after I left college with poor grades apart from one subject. I have super bad moral OCD( I always had OCD but this was scary). I ended up meeting a guy who was toxic but gave me attention. I started an NSFW account online for money/attention, I even nearly became a stripper ( so not me) andI would drink constantly, party till early hours in the morning and then he would like try and do stuff, I clearly was not read for. I ended up breaking it off but this caused a massive division and I lost any other new friends I made. 


When I was 19, I realised that I had enough and decided to apply for University with an extra year to get onto my course. I chosen English literature before deciding it wasn’t my field, but I would love to be a writer. Anyway I joined University and seemed to improve mentally a lot, I lived at home and would commute and had made some new friends and had a very good year. I remember thinking I feel so much better now and my OCD was present but had calmed down. 

Anyway I moved into accommodation for my 1st official year of University, I did Psychology and Sociology (which I love) and I was so happy. However, I met a girl on freshers week who befriended me and was just like my old toxic friend, I guess she sensed I was shy and wanted someone to abuse. This brought back PTSD from my previous toxic friend and I sank into a hole. My OCD turned into harm OCD and I had a mini breakdown and had to go home constantly and even my parents were concerned and confused. I had this toxic situationship at the time with a guy who would put me down, compare me to other people constantly and was a complete nightmare. I stayed longer than I should and it damaged me. I ended up coming home, feeling like a failure but went anyway. I did a year workload in like 2 months and passed somehow. I had made a new friend online and she seemed super nice, we spent the whole summer together. 

I feel I repaired my mental health over the summer as being away from that environment helped. I went back to Uni for 2nd year (I stayed home for accommodation) and I got invited to freshers with the girl I had befriended in the summer. Anyway I stayed at hers for freshers and her male friend walked me home as she wanted to stay in the club. I trusted him as she did. He knew I was drunk and started hugging me, I was like so uncomfortable and then he followed me up to her room and started kissing me and fingering me. I was so drunk and kind of scared, I didn’t do anything and went along with it. He started doing more sex acts and made me do stuff to him, luckily we didn’t have intercourse but only because he heard a flatmate come through the door. I told my friend and she said to report him for SA to the university. I did this and she came with me and I had to tell the whole story again (I was so embarrassed) the uni said they would sort it and well they didn’t and just laughed it off and took his side. The same friend then turned on me as apparently she had a crush on him and I had stole him from her point of view. I was too ashamed and embarrassed to tell anyway close to me and didn’t want the trauma of police involved. 

I went through a really weird time afterwards. I would book trips alone or meet people in cities offline to try and keep my mind active. I ended up getting spiked by one of these online friends and nearly SA again. I started not doing any work and just keeping myself distracted. I went on dates and would dump decent guys once they started discussing sex as sex made me wanna puke.

I had good and bad days for the next 6 months and my OCD has got worse and worse. I reconnected with an old friend who moved near by. This friend is addicted to drugs and just has orgies/ drug parties. I have been to a few and I only took weed, but I am tempted to try more to feel something. I know they aren’t the best friends but they accept me and make me feel wanted.

Anyway the last few months have been awful and I feel I am slowly slipping into how low I used to feel. My harm OCD is scary and constantly attacking my thoughts, my Uni work isn’t as good as it could be. I feel with my mental health and how this affects my performance that I will end up not doing good enough and failing University or not getting the grades I need for my dream masters at Durham University. I have had a few rejections at Jobs for being shy and quiet, which has made me hate myself. I feel I could be an academic, with a stable partner, drinking expensive coffee and maturing, but I can’t be independent or live alone as I have extreme OCD, miss days of Jobs/Uni and feel so lonely unless I get attention in toxic ways. My parents clearly want me to be independent and this causes arguments at home, which trigger my OCD off. 

I don’t want to die but I have constant days where I message an online friend who understands and explain how low I feel or points where I feel I want to check myself into a mental hospital. 

I feel I could be this way at 16, but now I look like a loser and are ruining chances I could have of being successful. I feel this battle with never end. Also I feel I am way more intelligent in the right zone, but I have struggled so much with mental health that just basic survival is hard for me.

I've been wanting to become more mature for a long time, and I thought my mother would start letting me handle things on my own.
The only thing she lets me do is aside from chores, is letting me go outside on the porch, and if I say something to her, going to my local coffee shop and the gas station.
She won't let me prove my maturity.
I keep seeing other people my age, even younger, being allowed to handle themselves; going places themselves, able to exist without a parent breathing down their necks, being allowed to have independence as great as a freakin' 22 year-old's!
I'm actively being held back from that; I can't go more than a mile away from my apartment, hell not even an MILLIONTH of a mile. I'm not allowed to go anywhere else without her breathing down my neck and constantly bothering me in public places, nor does she even allow me do anything that I actually want to do OTHER than just staying up in my room.
When I try to bring it up to her, she gets hostile and starts making up excuses, and when I try to argue against it, she calls me ""immature, spoiled, 'I let you do what you,'"" even going as far as to threaten me with stealing my things, cutting off my only way of getting any cash(until my SSDI comes), and shit like forcing me out of my room(where I can have actual privacy) and comparing me to my abuser.
I can't figure out any way to get this through her damn head. Even other people have been making excuses for her, and I'm REALLY pissed and stressed out.

Our 2yo is home full time as we try to manage all of this, and I am responsible for 99% of the childcare for both kids.

My husband is incredibly particular when it comes to standards of work.  He's well known for making licensed carpenters redo work that's entirely proper but doesn't look perfect, just because they have a piece of house wrap upside down or some functional-but-ugly rough framing.  In building our house, he's turned down help from our employees because he just ends up redoing most of what they've done anyway.  And to be clear, their work fully exceeds all code and best practice requirements, he's just so determined that this house needs to be done right that he cannot bring himself to accept anything less than absolute perfection.

So instead of having our licensed and experienced carpenters work with him, he's resorted to having me and my family help him on weekends.  And (to no one's surprise) we don't exactly meet his expectations either.  I can draft you a detail showing exactly how to build every aspect of the house, but I cannot operate the tools with the precision required to execute those details to his standard.  My dad is more than happy to show up and help in whatever way he can, but again doesn't have the skill to meet my husband's expectations.  My husband has gotten to a point where he's so burnt out and frustrated that he's just angry with everyone all the time.  The kids and I walk on eggshells because no one really knows when he's going to explode next.  He can't figure out why our toddler wants nothing to do with him 90% of the time, but it's entirely because she doesn't know what to expect from him.  In the ""before"" he was the most patient and loving Dad, and both kids absolutely adored him.  I was like chopped liver if he was in the room.  Now, they'll go to him if I'm physically unavailable but otherwise all of the parenting falls to me.

To add to all of that, when we first bought the place he thought it would be a good idea to build my parents a second dwelling on the property.  It's allowed under our local rules, and would work out well for all of us from a financial perspective.  It also gets them closer to us for childcare now and support for them as they age.  My parents aren't tidy people who meticulously maintain things (quite the opposite) and that was a concern I've had from the beginning, but originally he thought it wouldn't be a big deal because we'd just maintain things for them as part of the rental agreement.  But he's now so angry about everything that he doesn't want them here at all.  Except my parents sold their house this summer to take advantage of the housing market peak and are now renting while they wait for us to build their house.  So backing out of that isnt really a great option.

And, as a result of all of this, our sex life has all but died.  It's kind of hard to let myself be vulnerable to the person who seems repulsed by my existence, so I guess it's my fault that the bedroom is dying?  I'm not sure, but he seems to feel pretty strongly that it's my problem to fix.  Actually, it's all my problem to fix.

So.  He works hard, I don't dispute that.  I know he's under a lot of stress, and I know I don't have the ability to alleviate that stress.  If I could execute *anything* relating to the house (or anything else) to a standard he'd be happy with, I'd do it in a heartbeat.  But I can guarantee that anything I touch is going to be considered unacceptable, so it's not worth getting involved.

He waffles between wanting me to figure out how to back out of the second dwelling thing and agreeing that it's logically still the best thing for everyone in the long run.  He recognizes that I can't back out of that without destroying my relationship with my parents, and I'm concerned that even if I did blow up that relationship, it probably wouldn't fix all of the issues we're having.

Prior to buying the property and embarking on this whole project, things were good.  We had the typical disputes about chores and communication, but nothing that couldn't be resolved over a coffee during naptime.  I had hope that the issues we're currently having would get better once the house building stress was out of the picture, but I'm getting worried that our marriage isn't going to last long enough to see that point.

So I'm open to absolutely any advice you have to offer.  If cancelling my parents build at all costs is the best move, I'll figure out how to do that.

Tl;Dr: Building a house and my husband is angry and resentful because no one can meet his (incredibly high) standards except himself.  It's impacting everything from our parenting to our sex life, and I'm not sure what to do.

ETA:  Therapy is a no go.  I know it's the right answer and probably what we need, but he absolutely refuses.  I'll bring it up with him again, but he did it with his first wife and it didn't work so he's basically written it off.  One of the most important factors in therapy is choosing to be there and buying into the process, so unless he's on board I don't think it'll get us anywhere.

I've been working on this little productivity tool called [**PomoDaily**](https://pomodaily.com/), and I’m excited to finally share it. It’s a sleek, distraction-free Pomodoro timer with built-in **task management**, **progress tracking**, and a few cool features I really wanted for myself – like **Focus Zones** (ambient sounds), a **mini floating timer**, and **offline support** (your data stays in your browser!).

The idea is simple: help you stay focused, work in bursts, and take breaks without burning out. I personally use it every day for writing and coding, and it’s been a game changer for staying consistent without getting overwhelmed.

🆕 Just added:

* **Mini Timer (Picture-in-Picture mode)**
* **Task Auto-Check & Auto-Switch**
* **More Focus Zones** like Coffee Shop and Rain
* A fresh **Reports** tab to track your daily/weekly progress

Would love your thoughts or feedback if you try it out!

We were Grade 12 senior high school classmates. I started becoming interested in her on February 14. I had a classmate make a self-crocheted keychain that I planned to anonymously give to her on Valentine’s Day. I didn’t want her to know it was from me.

When she received it, she used it and hung it on her bag. I was lowkey happy seeing her use it.

Then March came — that’s when everything started. We became mutual. We got grouped together for an event group work that lasted from the 1st to 2nd week of March. That gave me the chance to talk to her every day. I showed my intentions clearly.

Our prom was in the last week of March. I really tried to win her over before prom so I could dance with her. I prepared a gift for her and included a quote — the same one from the keychain. We danced. Things went well.

Graduation was the 2nd week of April. On graduation day, I introduced her to my mother. My mom even took pictures of us. We were hopeful about our future together because we were going to the same city for college, far from our hometown.

I arrived in that city around the 3rd week of April to look for scholarships. I didn’t find any. She followed in the last week of April for a one-week stay, just to take an entrance exam at the university she already planned to attend.

On her 2nd day there, she invited me on a date — with her mother. It was hard to find a way to go because my boarding house was far from the city center, but I made it work. We spent time together from around 12pm to 5pm, since someone had to pick me up and it wasn’t easy to commute. On the 3rd day, she invited me again, but I struggled to get permission and a ride. I was late, but we still bonded while ice skating. After that, we sat and reflected with her mom. I asked her mother’s permission if I could court her daughter. Her mom was happy and said it was good that I asked her first.

Same time again — I had to leave at 5pm because I rode with someone heading home.

On the 4th day, she had her exam. On the 5th, she returned to our hometown.

I stayed in the new city and did everything I could to convince my aunt (who would fund my studies) to let me study at the same university as her. I told my aunt before when she was asking who's inviting me to hang out and go ice skating that she was my classmate before, that she was studying there too. But the truth is, I really wanted to study there not just because of her. That university aligned with my dreams of taking BS Psychology, and I felt it was the right environment for me, it was also just a bonus that my course is on the same campus of the university as hers.

However, my aunt didn’t agree. She believed gossip that students from that university were being forced into activism. She didn’t want me to go there. I kept convincing her, but it reached a point where she got bothered and called my mom. My mom scolded me and said I should be thankful someone is willing to send me to school and not be picky. They both assumed that the only reason I wanted to study there was because of her.

Because of that, I stopped pushing. I was worried they’d turn against our relationship. I couldn’t even do video calls with her anymore because my aunt would assume she was manipulating me. But we kept sending each other voice messages. May was a happy month for us.

By the 3rd week of May, I returned to our hometown. Our interaction became purely through messages. On the 4th week of May, she went back to the city to get her uniform and school ID. The day before her flight, I invited her on a simple ice cream date. I wasn’t used to going out and I was cautious about spending, but I wanted to see her. We had fun. She stayed less than a week and returned before June.

We were still doing well in the first week of June. We constantly chatted, but I couldn’t video call because I didn’t have my own room, and my home was more toxic than my aunt’s house. I often opened up to her about my problems at home.

By the last day of June, she told me I was changing — that I wasn’t consistent anymore. She feared that I only put in effort before because I was chasing her. Now that I ""had"" her, she felt like I stopped trying.

We had a calm chat. I reassured her. I explained my situation honestly and told her my intentions were real. I told her I had plans for us, and I wanted to give her a future that wasn’t full of struggle. I hadn’t asked her yet if I could formally court her because I was saving that for when we were together again in the city, because I wanted it to be consistent.

We ended the conversation on a good note — or so I thought.

The next day, she became cold and dry. Her replies were short and delayed. I asked her daily if she was okay. She always said yes, but I could feel something was off.

At the same time, I was busy looking for a university very close to hers so I could fulfill my original plan, to finally take another step for us. I worked hard to convince my aunt — and I finally succeeded. I told her excitedly, but she didn’t seem interested anymore.

Three days later, I asked her, “Are you still okay with me?” That’s when she admitted she wasn’t sure anymore. She couldn’t see a future with me. She said she was bothered by what I told her about my current situation — that I couldn’t afford her what I wanted to give yet, that she didn't want to wait for someone who cannot risk for her. She said she didn’t want something extravagant, just something with real care. She felt like I wasn’t even making time to see her.

She said things that I was similar to her exes. She thought I was different, but maybe I wasn’t. She asked for space.

Before that, I had invited her to a friend’s birthday hangout. She refused. That was when I started to panic.

From then until June 13, I became desperate, but I hadn't realized this until after June 13. I didn’t give her space because I haven't really believed about the effectiveness of giving space before, I know it's due to my past experiences that I believed it. I messaged her constantly, trying to win her back. I even tried to call her. She refused at first, but I begged her to just listen, and she did. I poured out everything — my regrets, my sincerity, my hope.

I invited her to meet on June 10. She said yes. I planned everything. But she canceled on the day itself. I still wanted to do something, so I sent her flowers and a letter that night.

She messaged me. She said she was surprised and thanked me — but also said that it would change anything. That she had made her decision.

On June 13, I messaged again, saying about how much I'm hoping for us and for a chance, that's where she had enough. She finally told me everything. She said the flowers made her feel worse. That her ex did the same. It made her feel like I was just like them. I explained that while the action might be the same, the intention was different. But I couldn’t save what we had. We ended things — in good terms, she said that I should love myself more first because I can't give love to someone when I'm not confident about myself, but after that we're not cut off yet.

On June 16, I left her a goodnight note. She replied. Then we started exchanging notes daily.

On June 18, I went to the province for almost 2 weeks with my uncle. I learned a lot about self-love and reflection during that time.

When I got back, things were cold again. I reached out and asked if we could meet on July 1. She didn’t reply directly but asked if I was available on August 9 — her early debut. She reminded me that I was supposed to be her cotillion partner, and she's planning on doing it.

I asked if the event would be in our hometown because I had just learned my classes started on July 7, and I hadn't told her about my schedule, which has Saturday classes because I knew she'd not continue her plan for me. She said there would be practices days before. She told me it was okay if I couldn’t come. But I insisted. I said I’d go home every weekend, to book for ferry or flight. I even planned to work part-time to afford it.

On June 27, our university announced that classes would start on August 4 instead. I was so happy. I could save more and only focus on my flight to attend her event at August 9.

From then until June 30, I only sent her short notes. On June 30, I asked again if we could meet on July 1. She asked what for. I said to hang out and talk. She agreed.

When we met, I had planned for something light, it wasn't supposedly not to deep talk. But when I saw her, I could tell she was expecting something serious. I asked if she was okay. She said yes — but I knew she wasn’t.

I apologized, and we had a deep talk. I kept reassuring her that I didn’t want to give up. I admitted my faults. She told me she was exhausted. That it felt one-sided. That I wasn’t really risking anything for her.

I respected her feelings, but I admit that I also got respectfully defensive, about what I can give and I can prove because I wanted her to know I was changing. I told her I didn’t want her to just be a reason to become better — I wanted myself to grow and become better with her.

I reminded her of what she told me on June 13, how I got motivated by it — that I should fill my own cup first. I’ve been doing that. I kept saying that this will be worth it, that I'm willing for change, I assured my intentions. But her answer remained, “I don’t know, I just don't know anymore.”

She said she wanted to go home. I offered to walk her. She agreed. I asked if she had a bit of time left and invited her for cold coffee. After that, she said she’d take a taxi. I walked her to the taxi and said goodbye.

I messaged her and said thank you so much fot the time and told her to stay safe. She replied, “Thank you. You too.”

That night, I told her in a note that I’d give her space but that I’d still be here. On July 2, I left another note wishing her a good day. But she never replied anymore. She ended our TikTok streak that night too and reposted something about being in her “cutting off era.”

That’s when I knew it was really over.

The last hope I held on to was being her cotillion partner. But I couldn’t ask her directly anymore because of what recently happened. On July 3, I asked a friend who was invited and in the cotillion, about if she said something about the practice schedule, and said there's none yet, and also insisted that he'd ask her if I was still her cotillion partner. That friend asked her directly.

That’s when I learned — I was no longer her partner, and she replied it casually as if there's nothing happened.

I wasn’t home when I found out. My heart shattered. I walked aimlessly crossed roads a bunch of times, almost got hit by cars. That’s when I accepted it: it was over.

I regret being desperate. I regret not respecting the space she asked for. I dragged it out for so long when it could’ve ended it when it ended in peace between us.

But swore to myself that I'm changing. I’m growing, where I could've shown it to her. This change is for me, my growth, and could've been for the both of us.

Maybe one day. Maybe after years, we'll cross paths again, maybe she’ll see who I became. I still believe people deserve chances. But I know that’s not up to me.

The thing is I really loved her, she was my 1st time and I only loved her on the ways that I still know how to, I've been constantly learning because I wanted it to be better for us, for us to grow and learn together. It's so hard for me because what I feel is that I gave what I could give, haven't realized that it was considered as minimum effort. I will note it and will do my best to risk and love myself more.

Thank you for reading. I’m open to any thoughts or advice, please feel free. Because I believe that part of growing is learning from mistakes. I’m here for that.

1lrzdam,https://i.redd.it/1mxz1n93uyaf1.jpeg,Just updated my minimal journal app,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share a quick update on my iPad journal app, it’s called Mino.

There’s now a simple swipe gesture for navigation. When you’re using an iPad and have finger drawing turned off, you can draw with Apple Pencil and swipe with your fingers to move between pages. It’s not a fancy feature, but it makes the journaling experience feel a bit smoother and more natural.

I also added a freehand crop tool, which is part of the Pro features. The crop itself is nothing new. It works like any other freehand crop, where you draw a line around the part of the photo you want to keep. What makes it a bit more fun is a toggle that adds an outline and shadow, giving the cropped image a sticker like feeling. It’s a small detail, but I personally really like using it when decorating pages.

If you haven’t seen my post about the app before, here’s a quick overview. It’s focused on freeform journaling with Apple Pencil, using dotted or squared grid pages without any preset templates. I wanted something that feels flexible and minimal, so you can create your own system instead of fitting into a fixed layout. It’s built mainly for iPad, but it syncs with iCloud so you can view your pages on iPhone too.

The app is free to download, and you can use the basic journaling tools without paying. If you enjoy decorating your pages with photos, stickers, or extra features, there is a one time Pro upgrade with no subscription.

If you’d like to give it a try, you can download it here:

App Store: [Mino: Minimal Journal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mino-minimal-journal/id6470970423)

I've been talking to this woman for a few months now. She's beautiful, fun, laughs at my jokes, and actually seeks me out to have a conversation. It feels amazing when she's the one to seek me out, instead of me being the one to initiate contact every time. I thought I swore off the idea of dating for good, which is why when this girl is showing signs of interest (I hadn't seen her for a week or so and when I ask her where she's been, she says I've been working the night shifts so she never got a chance to say hi to me - I never told her that. She asked my coworkers about my schedule.) and asked me if I wanted to join her in the pool, I was a bit taken off guard.  
  
Yeah, it's not a date for sure, but I was hoping to take it as an opportunity to ask her out on a proper coffee date. You might be thinking, ""well, you clearly love interacting with this woman and she invited you out, why WOULDN'T you say yes?""

Well, here's the thing. In the past, I attracted women in just about the same way people attract mosquitoes. Or leeches. I've been through *plenty* of abusive relationships in the past that sucked me dry of everything I had to give. I had no enthusiasm, no money, no love for life. I gave every single shred of myself to keep women close to me that ultimately did not care for me, and only wanted to use me for what resources I could give them. Some days got close to the point I was genuinely contemplating suicide because one ex was trying to convince me I only mattered to her and nobody else. Crazy right?

So when this wonderful woman comes, there's this voice in the back of my head that tells me ""Cut her off."", ""She's just trying to use you."", ""She doesn't actually care about you like you care about her,"", ""You don't attract healthy women, she's a psychopath like all the rest"", etc etc. I *know* it's not true and that I couldn't possibly know this girl is somehow insane, but there's a nervous itch that keeps telling me that I should just cut her off and block her before I get hurt again.

I could really use some words of encouragement from some guys and girls who have gone through so much of the same issues I had and still found someone they can be happy with since I don't know if I can trust myself to actually not flake on her.
