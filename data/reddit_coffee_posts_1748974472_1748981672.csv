1l2lv5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l2lv5d/grinder_advice_and_thoughts_on_the_upcoming/,Grinder advice.. and thoughts on the upcoming Baratza encore esp PRO [$400],"Hi all!! I'm new to this community and brewing espresso at home! 

I've been mainly enjoying pour overs and really enjoy drinking light/medium roast fruity coffees. I also enjoy doing tastings and comparing different coffees at once. So single dose, relatively low retention type of setup worked for me.  I was using Fellow Ode for this and I feel like i was able to dial to the extend that I can enjoy. I wanted to mention this to highlight that this may be my current tasting limit.. I'm sure there are better grinders, but I'm happy with the level of control that Ode provided. 

Given my positive experience with Fellow, I gave a shot to Opus for my new espresso setup, but I really did not enjoy it. The dialing experience was finicky, and espressso capability felt like an add-on, rather than primary functionality of the grinder. I really felt like I needed more control on the steps. 

I see a few options out there, but also don't want to spend huge amount of money for my first setup. df64 seems like one of the options in the price range, but I also wanted to check with you if Baratza encore esp pro would be worth waiting for. Looks like it's a stepless option in theory, but diplay shows 0.5 steps.. however there still are 40 steps on display that's dedicated to the espresso range. Sounds like plenty for my taste buds:) I also suspect the retention will be similar in both of these devices.. Wanted to hear your thoughts. ",1,1748981146.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

i just had a the derealization this morning, due to high stress of exams and i was drinking a cup of coffee daily these past 4 days, it was trippy, i just came home at and slept the whole afternoon, and now im feeling better thank god, it has been 3 weeks now, i greened out smoking some herbs, and it was like my body had an overload and disconnected,

is it gonna be a problem im gonna start dealing with, or is it just temporary and it is just my body recovering, like is it gonna come in waves slower and slower till it dissapears or is gonna be with me forever,

i truely hope it dont become a problem, and i didnt just awake a sickness from deep within, also i find my body trying to go to that feeling again, like when you have a place that hurt but you cant help but just touch it again, even it hurts, i feel like sometimes my body wonders hmm what was that feeling again that caused me pain and anxiety, let me try awakening it again, and it is extremely annoying,

when is it that i should absolutely seek professional help, and who can i talk to, (online i can go in person expensive), i also have migraines genetically from my mother, and my head was hurting probably form coffe,

also when i was a kid i had this thing that i would do for fun, that said in a loop while i stared at something ""this is real i am in this exact moment"" and it was weird like i became now, in that exact moment realizing that i am living, but ironically made it that i am also not now (in that moment when i did it),

now whenever i have this derealization or stuff, it feels like my perseption of depth dissapears, and what am seeing is all the world is, turning what i see into like an image or a painting that i can in an other upper world just turn my vision and see something else, like when i am watching tv and i can turn my eyes, my perseption of space and my surrounding also dissapears leading to a feeling of bit of confusing, like what i am seeing is all there is, like i no longer have a 360 view of the world. its like i am a drone seeing things from far, not that intense, but in a way like that, which leds to me imagining that things are biig or small, or like there could be a small adventurer that can climb this big mountain which is usually what i am seeing,

it is like my brain forgets the familiarity it built with the world and the places i know, and just acts like it fogot everything and i was some alien observing the world thru my lenses, my eyes, just like some small alien that sees thru my eyes.

it is absolutely trippy ngl, in a bad not good way, and this morning when i felt like it, i had this anxiety and fear that made it even more present, like fear of it happening, it happens, this fear amplifies it, i was passing exam and i couldnt focus fully because whenever i zoned out or was just focusly looking at my paper while writing things become 2d and lose their dimensions and stuff,

i went to the bathroom, and those walls became all what the world was in some way, like i had nothing behind nothing in the sides, i couldnt feel the things that surround me, and all what the world was was these walls that i was seeing, either that or the feeling of me sitting somewhere and dreaming all of this.

bit long but please some help, i know this is temporary and its just my brain recovering and itll go normal, please if it was permenant DONT TELL ME THAT, cause at this state it might make things worse, what i fear most is going insane, but it is starting to get really annoying ngl, maybe this will help someone describe what they felt better, i tried to describe the feeling in depth i could.

## Key Features Analysis

The best replica candles differentiate themselves through a combination of high-quality ingredients, meticulous scent composition, and long-lasting performance. Careful consideration of these features ensures a realistic and enjoyable olfactory experience.

**Wax composition**

The type of wax used in a replica candle greatly affects its burn time, scent throw, and overall quality. Soy wax is a popular choice due to its clean burning properties and renewable nature. Beeswax offers a natural honeyed aroma and a longer burn time. Paraffin wax, while less expensive, can produce more soot and may not offer the same depth of fragrance. High-end replica candles often feature a blend of waxes to optimize performance and scent diffusion. The ideal wax composition for a replica candle effectively binds and releases the intricate layers of fragrance notes, ensuring a consistent and captivating aroma throughout its lifespan.

**Scent Notes & Accuracy**

The heart of any replica candle lies in its scent profile. The accuracy and complexity of the scent notes are crucial for replicating the intended experience. These candles typically feature a combination of top, middle, and base notes that evolve over time. Top notes are the initial impression,middle notes form the core of the fragrance,and base notes provide a lasting foundation. The best replica candles employ a complex layering of natural and synthetic fragrances to achieve depth and realism. For example, a ""Library"" scented candle might incorporate notes of aged paper, leather, and wood, while a ""Beach Walk"" candle could blend marine accords, coconut, and sun-kissed skin.

**Fragrance Concentration**

The fragrance concentration, measured as the percentage of fragrance oil in the wax, determines the intensity of the scent throw. A higher fragrance concentration results in a stronger,more pervasive aroma. However, an excessive amount of fragrance can overwhelm the senses and lead to an artificial or unpleasant experience. The ideal fragrance concentration strikes a balance between potency and subtlety, creating a noticeable yet not overpowering scent profile. High-quality replica candles typically contain a fragrance concentration of 8-12%, ensuring optimal scent diffusion without compromising the overall fragrance balance.

**Burn Time & Quality**

Burn time is an essential factor for determining the value and longevity of a replica candle. A well-crafted candle should burn evenly and cleanly, without excessive smoking or tunneling. The quality of the wick also plays a meaningful role in the burn performance. A lead-free cotton wick is preferred for its clean burning properties and consistent flame. The burn time should be consistent with the manufacturer's specifications, typically ranging from 40 to 80 hours for standard-sized candles. A well-made replica candle will provide hours of immersive fragrance, transforming your space into a sanctuary of cherished memories and desired atmospheres.

Two years ago, my father needed ALL of his teeth pulled because his gum disease was just that bad. I started saving up money, and talked to my dentist about going through the process of getting my teeth straightened. They weren't terrible, but there was crowding that made it tough to floss, I always had tatar building up, and my gums were prone to bleeding. 

She set me up, and I was targeted to only need 18 trays. I'm a once a day eater, only drink coffee or water, so having these buggers in for 22 hours wasn't a problem. I was finished in 180 days without any problems besides needing a redo of the buttons once.

I got the retainer, and I could tell it wasn't right. It was way, way tighter than any of the aligners had been. I went to my dentist week two because it was making some of my top teeth tilt to point inwards. She saw it was wrong immediately. I was given another imaging scan. I was told I'd get some trays to correct how the retainer wasn't designed properly, then a new retainer. 

They scheduled me for TWENTY-FIVE TRAYS. A whole year potentially. To correct one month of the bad retainer. I don't think I can go through anymore of the enamel shaving. Anymore time off of work. I'm so upset with this. Did I waste all my money? I was hoping to relocate in a few months, and that's clearly off the table now.

# Papers, Please

It took sixteen minutes to get to my gate starting from the parking garage‚Äîseven minutes more than usual for RIC. I lost my driver‚Äôs license two days before, and spent the morning of my flight collecting every other ID and form with my name on it. The TSA agent at the security bridge waves a supervisor over, who then thumbs through my half-inch thick envelope of personal documents. My envelope is handed back to me, ‚ÄúJust run his bags through the extra screening.‚Äù Now flush with time after my unnecessarily early arrival, I grab a seat at the only restaurant open inside the Evelyn Byrd terminal. I‚Äôm tapping my pocket with the envelope every few minutes, the current climate less than ideal for losing every identifying document you possess. As my order of what appears to be triple fried chicken tenders arrives, I check my carry-on for any Imodium I might have packed. I tap my pocket one more time.

\* \* \* \* \*

I‚Äôm on my way to bear witness to the fastest growing form of education in its least hospitable region‚Äîa state that ranks [50th out of 50](https://education.jhu.edu/edpolicy/policy-research-initiatives/homeschool-hub/states/massachusetts/) in homeschool enrollment. Awaiting my reception at the Sturbridge, Massachusetts Super 8 is no one. I pace around for a few minutes until I see a note with a number for me to call. A once recently asleep man lumbers into the building and slides behind an unresponsive check-in computer. I fight the urge to join in as he starts playing with the router. The system boots up after a few minutes and I‚Äôm sent to the penthouse (2nd floor) with a beautiful view into the heart of New England.

# The 2025 MASSHope Convention

The next morning, I down a paper cup of oatmeal between a CVS and Yankee Liquor on my walk to the convention. I passed on the discount block-rate at the Sturbridge Hotel and Conference Center, accepting the premium to enjoy some distance whenever I could find it. I arrive just as the morning keynote kicks off, finding a lone seat among the 150 or so attendees who arrived on time. As I settle in my seat, a man in colonial dress takes the stage to address the crowd, ‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôm in this get-up today in my incarnation as Uncle Rick the storyteller.‚Äù The man in stockings and tricorn hat is why I had come. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you know this or not,‚Äù he taunts his Yankee crowd, ‚ÄúBut history was invented in Virginia, not Massachusetts!‚Äù

But Rick isn‚Äôt the keynote this morning; he hasn‚Äôt been seen much in the past eight years. He is only on stage to hawk his audiobook memberships and curriculum he‚Äôll be selling over the weekend. I will have to catch up with him later. He wraps the sales pitch in prayer, and the headliner begins to take the stage, the room breaking into applause as she flips on her personal pink lavalier microphone. ‚ÄúHomeschooling by far and away, next to introducing our kids to Jesus, has been the best thing that we have ever done. And he‚Äôs going to sanctify you through the process of home education.‚Äù Behind her is the keynote title projected on the wall, *Like Arrows in the Hands of a Warrior*.

# Heidi

‚ÄúI first heard about homeschoolers in the 80s, and they were the people who didn‚Äôt register their kids with Social Security ‚Ä¶ I get it now. We all know we‚Äôre being poisoned, but that‚Äôs a whole other workshop!‚Äù

Heidi St. John is the keynote slot for a reason. The crowd is eating this up.

‚ÄúCan you guys tell I ran for Congress? You should have seen me!‚Äù Before her third place finish in the 2022 Washington Republican primary, Heidi had already become one of Homeschooling‚Äôs most popular speakers over the last two decades. If the first wave of Homeschooling brought it into existence, Heidi and the rest of the second wave are responsible for bringing it into America‚Äôs alternative counter-culture.

This may be a Homeschooling convention, but the *schooling* aspect functions mostly as set dressing. Anyone in the audience who has made that assumption is set straight, ‚ÄúThe Homeschool moms are wringing their hands. ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt make it through the math book!‚Äô My question is, ‚Äòbut did you make it through God‚Äôs book?‚Äô‚Äù The stakes are far higher than a child‚Äôs education. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt actually care if you ever need to know math!‚Äù

Heidi continues through slides of particularly poor artwork, reminding the parents that they are preparing for ‚Äúliteral battle.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is the image I want you guys to keep in your mind.‚Äù Heidi‚Äôs slide switches to the next image, a father praying over his sleeping child. ‚ÄúThis is a spiritual battle! ‚Ä¶ Dad‚Äôs not afraid about a math lesson ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs not important!‚Äù

Heidi then asks the crowd to look a little closer at the photo. ‚ÄúIf you zoom in‚Äîkeep your eye on this‚ÄîI want you to look at the top window ‚Ä¶ Can you see what‚Äôs happening‚Äù The audience is in wonder. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a spiritual battle outside of the room of that child!‚Äù A sea of phones begin to pop up from the audience as the crowd takes snapshots of the projection. ‚ÄúI think if we could see the spiritual warfare with the naked eye, every one of us would be on our faces before the Lord.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/y7a1an6o8q4f1.jpg?width=568&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=120b31c336175e4c331784d03279e514d97e8c79

Well versed readers may have already picked up that the arrows in the title keynote are, in fact, people. Heidi hammers the motif repeatedly through the thickest of skulls in the crowd, ‚ÄúChildren have been given to you like arrows in the hands of their warriors. Those children literally are God‚Äôs arrows.‚Äù

We near the finale, Heidi‚Äôs voice already hoarse for the last several minutes. Up until now, her pink\* lavalier mic has been mostly for show. She enters a much slower and quieter cadence, and tells the story of Jim Elliot, killed on a missionary trip. For a literal war currently waging, they haven‚Äôt been able to produce any new martyrs since I was told the story.

I look around at the kids in the crowd, most unaware they have just been drafted for an impending war. ‚ÄúWhat are your arrows for but to shoot? You are training your children for a battle that will take them far beyond any academic pursuit that you could ever engage in.‚Äù I feel nauseous, wondering which Homeschool book or convention was the impetus for my own botched conscription. Apparently, the parents look nauseous too.

‚ÄúI feel like they should give barf bags to new homeschoolers before they go into the vendor hall.‚Äù

Heidi hasn‚Äôt made Homeschooling sound very fun. In fact, most of these workshops spend a good deal of time warning parents it‚Äôs actually going to be quite the opposite. But if the alternative is to lose your children, can you afford not to?

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get overwhelmed by what you see ‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt let it become a burden. You‚Äôre going to have bad days. You‚Äôre going to cry ‚Ä¶ You guys, welcome to the conference!‚Äù

# The Exhibit Hall

The audience empties from the central ballroom and disperses to the first of dozens of breakout workshops available throughout the weekend. I choose to exchange the stuffy air of the ballroom for the musty air of the exhibit hall, where a bin of familiar posters for sale catches my eye. I flip through. On one are three pledges: one each to the American Flag, the Bible, and the Christian flag. Others provide ‚ÄúAnswers to Evolution‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Ten Commandments‚Äù in cartoon form. The last, a depiction of the Old Testament Tabernacle. I flip it over and check the Copyright at the bottom. 2005. Above is an advertisement for the accompanying PowerPoint CD ‚Äúfor your class or home!‚Äù Still available to purchase for [$39.99 at GoodSoil.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20250603140207/https://www.goodsoil.com/resources/tabernacle-powerpoint-presentation/).

I stop by a handful of other booths. The Great Wolf Lodge is advertising their homeschool day packages. Another booth has two men in knock-off Boy Scout uniforms recruiting for Trail Life, a breakaway organization from Boy Scouts after the organization ended its discriminatory policy towards gay scouts‚Äîthe hideous uniforms a dead giveaway on the reason for the split. One row over I ask the USAF National Guard what brought them here. ‚ÄúJust doing research and came across it,‚Äù she tells me. Besides her husband‚Äôs step-brother, she doesn‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs been homeschooled. ‚ÄúThis is a new experience for me.‚Äù

I grab lunch, a burger from the concession-type room. As it‚Äôs handed to me from a kitchen with no stove, I make note to seek out a vegetable soon.

# Uncle Rick

Rick Boyer and I are neighbors of sorts; less so from a physical distance standpoint, and more by our coexistence in the tiny world of Homeschooling. In 1980, Virginia did not recognize the practice, so Rick‚Äôs home outside Lynchburg became a testing site for what happens when parents just stopped sending their kids to school one day. His early adopter status brought him close to the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) once they put down roots to the north of him in Loudoun County, and Uncle Rick started making his first appearances at the newly formed Home Educators Association of Virginia (HEAV) convention a couple years later. Rick joined HEAV‚Äôs board in the early 2000s, about the same time I began homeschooling in Virginia‚Äîthe soil of my childhood tended and groomed by Rick and a small battalion of constant gardeners.

But in 2016, after fourteen years on the board, Rick left suddenly. He received a call from the HSLDA president; his yearly invite to their National Leadership Conference was being rescinded. [Accusations of grooming a minor ](https://www.ashleyeaster.com/blog/rick-boyer-sr-and-sexual-boundary-crossing)lost him access to everything he had helped to build. He has been missing ever since, his wife becoming the face for their Character Concepts brand. Rick spent seven years trying to sue the (now adult) minor‚Äîas well as anyone who shared the allegations. But he ran out of funds; he needed to pay the liens issued against him by his second lawyer, and the case was brought to a close at the end of 2024.

[This newspaper clipping is from the original suit, which he then amended to $10 million dollars after the the first suit failed to meet the court‚Äôs standards.](https://preview.redd.it/7k2n8brs8q4f1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73c6a6c52ca598fae0ccbf391ed3d77cac393d39)

Rick is still in his colonial get-up as he addresses the gaggle of children assembled before him. I take a seat as isolated as possible from the rest of the room. You might think a 30 year old male sitting alone at story time would seem out of place, but no one questions me, there is no such thing as out of place here. As Rick tells the kids some (likely apocryphal) stories from the Revolutionary War, I‚Äôm passed a stack of flyers for the Uncle Rick Audio Book Club. $14.95 a month. ‚ÄúWho buys this shit?‚Äù I think to myself as I pass the stack to the next potential customer. I do some quick math to find what subscriber count breaks six figures (558), and consider if it‚Äôs not too late to switch paths.

# Marilyn

Rick finishes story time, swapping places with his wife at the vendor booth. I take my seat in a far less attended workshop for her session, *You Mean I Can Teach History Like That?* It promises to show how you can teach the true history of our country to your kids, but in practice is a reading of book suggestions for 50 minutes. Despite the extra dose of Adderall I am nearly asleep a few minutes in, but I jolt back awake about halfway through. On the projector is Judge Roy Moore, who lost his 2017 U.S. Senate race after allegations of serial predation and grooming of minors. Underneath his photo is an endorsement for the Boyers‚Äô history books, which you can buy as a bundle for $131 at their booth or online.

Opting to skip the day‚Äôs last session, I head out to grab a burrito (counting the pico inside as my vegetable for the day) and take a quick hike in the nearby state park. As I return, the glow of the Super 8 sign draws my car to the motel parking lot, but the glow of a McDonald‚Äôs arch 1,000 feet further has a stronger pull. They have spicy versions of McChickens up here. Incredible.

# Convention Day 2 | Vegetables Eaten: 1

# What‚Äôs a Dad to Do?

Heidi again has the Saturday morning keynote spot at 9, but it‚Äôs one I‚Äôve already heard several times so I really don‚Äôt give a shit. Today is all about Rick.

A dad in his 30s arrives before Rick‚Äôs 10:30 workshop at the same time as me. Placing his ball-cap down on the table, I‚Äôm able to see the patch above the snap: two Celtic crosses flanking the words ‚ÄúShepherds We Shall Be,‚Äù a reference to the 1999 shoot-em-up cult classic *The Boondocks Saints*‚Äîa movie where two rough-and-tumble Irish Catholic twins on a mission from God who purify Boston of evil with blood and gunfire for about 90 minutes. I recognize the reference immediately, as the opening theme was 17-year-old-me‚Äôs very first ringtone.

Rick walks up to the lectern, ‚ÄúHi, everybody! Hear me okay?‚Äù He no longer has his tricorn hat, opting for a suit today. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to talk about dad‚Äôs role in the home-educating family.‚Äù Homeschool mothers being both the de facto educators and homemakers has left the movement struggling for 40 years to figure out what it is exactly that a father contributes.

Back in the 80s, the lesson Rick received was to ‚Äútake as much of cooking, cleaning, and laundry off of mom so that she could be free to do the teaching.‚Äù But the idea of making tangible contributions to the household didn‚Äôt sit right with Rick, so he looked for an answer elsewhere. The Lord showed him the answer he wanted through the Scripture. God is good.

The dads in the room begin writing down all the ways they will not be contributing as Rick lists them off. He tells us a father provides, which is a fancy way of saying ‚Äòhas a job‚Äô. As for the teaching aspect, fathers teach by example. This doesn‚Äôt mean teaching anything; just to do whatever you were going to do anyways, but with an inflated sense of self-importance. And of course the big one, fathers are protectors. This can be done by inventing non-existent threats so you can perform rituals of protection as proof to your wife that you‚Äôre not a pussy. *Boondock Saints* man begins writing furiously. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much our kids need to be protected from, sometimes even in the church. Youth groups are famous for stealing parental loyalty and turning kids over to the youth director.‚Äù

Rick rattles off a few more, ‚ÄúOne of the most important things that a dad provides for his kids is a trade, a means of making a living.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhat about girls, Rick?‚Äù I think to myself  
  
‚ÄúWhat about girls?‚Äù  
  
Oh.  
  
‚ÄúThe Proverbs 31 woman‚Äôs work fits in with a mom‚Äôs responsibilities ‚Ä¶ not in a job that required her to be up close and personal with men. If you think about people you know that committed adultery and you ask yourself, ‚Äòwhere did they meet?‚Äô ‚Ä¶ It was in the workplace, a hotbed of immorality. So I want to train my daughters to be keepers at home and then be paid without violating their godly standards.‚Äù

Creating abstract barriers between daughters and paid labor is a needed step in supplementing the parenting and teaching dad won‚Äôt be doing, which is why they will need to maintain a good supply of them.

‚ÄúHave a bunch of kids. That‚Äôs a great way to educate your kids ‚Ä¶ My kids practiced parenting growing up ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs God‚Äôs plan for restoring a godly culture. Maybe that‚Äôll work for America, but not if Christians don‚Äôt have children ‚Ä¶ Y‚Äôall hate abortion. Can‚Äôt prevent a human life from continuing; why can you prevent one from beginning?‚Äù

I had planned to introduce myself to Rick after the workshop, but the morning‚Äôs coffee changed my plans. After relieving myself on the three Zyns inside the urinal, I hurry back to find he has already left. I head to the vendor hall and see he has taken his spot at the Character Concepts booth.

\* \* \* \* \*

Rick was delighted when I asked to interview him, even offering me a free year of his audiobook club. It was truly incredible to run into someone from HEAV and a former Little Buddy‚Ñ¢ of Uncle Rick. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt so incredible, this was after all a testament to the promise of Homeschooling come full circle.

While Rick was honored by the request, he wasn‚Äôt sure he was the right man for the interview. ‚ÄúI have kind of been out of the movement for eight years.‚Äù But running into him was such a pleasant surprise, a conversation with someone from my own childhood would make my podcast that much more compelling. Rick was sold. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it.‚Äù Rick said he would have time at 2:15 before his 3:30 workshop, the final event on the schedule.

‚ÄúDoes it feel good to be back?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúOh yes.‚Äù Rick closes his eyes and sighs with relief. ‚ÄúWonderful.‚Äù

# Turning Point USA

After lunch, I kill some time in the exhibit hall and strike up a 30-minute conversation with a woman manning the table for Turning Point USA. She tells me about running her chapter for her co-op, and the frustration of trying to get others to join, ‚ÄúNone of this is political. You‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòOh, I don‚Äôt do politics.‚Äô We don‚Äôt do politics either!‚Äù I glance down, a bowl full of Jolly Ranchers next to ‚Äúrip food dyes‚Äù buttons stares back at me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a free club for kids. I‚Äôm not pushing anything that‚Äôs fascism or anything like that.‚Äù I pocket a few buttons as souvenirs.

A man comes up and joins our conversation, ‚ÄúYou heard Heidi St John speak this morning?‚Äù The woman behind the Turning Point USA table gestures to a poster-board, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs coming to our young woman‚Äôs conference in July.‚Äù

[It‚Äôs a real who‚Äôs who of shitheads](https://preview.redd.it/bbt2cxow8q4f1.jpg?width=619&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31dc314b967428572c6991d408723f5d0858cb2a)

‚ÄúShe was phenomenal‚Äù he lets us know. ‚ÄúAnd she challenged the men too, like, ‚ÄòWhere the heck are you guys?‚Äô‚Äù

Turning Point woman agrees. She wants men to be like her friend Rich, who was arrested last year for blocking a transgender woman from using the public restroom off the Massachusetts Turnpike. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a badge of honor. That‚Äôs what we need.‚Äù The man who joined us accepts the blame for the way things are right now. ‚ÄúMy son, his freshman year first day, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs your preferred pronouns?‚Äô My wife went to the school committee meeting ‚Ä¶ It was one against 16 committee members. So we‚Äôre homeschooling ‚Ä¶ but if we had been involved 10 years ago this wouldn‚Äôt be happening.‚Äù

Our conversation reached her complaints of HBCUs being given money while North Carolina hurricane victims were dying in the streets (or something), and I decide I have had my fill of Turning Point USA woman. Rick was nowhere to be found, so I wandered around the hall a little more.

# HSLDA

‚ÄúDo you know what HSLDA is?‚Äù Two women in their late 20s ask as I approach the booth.

‚ÄúFormer member‚Äù I tell them.

They ask if I have any kids. The convention nearing its end, my last Adderall a distant memory, I struggle to remember the aberration in the heartland of the real I‚Äôve created this weekend. I regain my grip on things, responding with a very generous interpretation of ‚Äúsoon‚Äù and tell them I am visiting a friend from Virginia.

‚ÄúDo you guys know if you‚Äôre going to homeschool under religious exemption? On the HSLDA website on the Virginia page‚Ä¶ the religious exemption should be on there somewhere. From my understanding it‚Äôs pretty easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I saw there was something about the religious exemption earlier this year in the news?‚Äù

[‚ÄúThere was. They were trying to get rid of it‚Ä¶ It got squashed‚Äù](https://homeiswherethehatredis.com/2025/03/06/you-will-have-control/)

They let me know about this *new* organization, [Coalition for Responsible Home Education (CRHE)](https://responsiblehomeschooling.org/), that is advocating against Homeschool Freedom‚Ñ¢. ‚ÄúSo there are kids from our era of Homeschooling that said, ‚ÄòI had a bad experience. We need more regulation‚Äô but it‚Äôs like the anecdotal experience versus what is actually happening across the board.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo they‚Äôre homeschoolers?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúCorrec- Well some of them are; not all of them. Some of them who weren‚Äôt homeschoolers, they find one homeschooler that had a bad experience that is then advocating for the organization. So a couple of them are homeschooled.‚Äù

I find it an interesting way to describe an organization founded by and virtually entirely run by homeschool alumni.

Before I leave, they tell me my podcast idea exploring what Homeschooling looks like from the perspective of its own graduates is a great idea. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really needed‚Ä¶ If you can take your perspective and then apply it to others who have the same experience, that‚Äôs really powerful.‚Äù

\* \* \* \* \*

It is now past 2:45. Rick‚Äôs chair at the booth is still empty. I pick through some items on display nearby. I flip over The Sibling Challenge game, promising to help my kids love their siblings (with God‚Äôs help). The clock is about to hit 2:50 when I hear a voice call for me. ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm back!‚Äù Thoughtfully, Rick had been looking for me. He seems excited. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go sit down.‚Äù

# Rick

# Phase 1

‚ÄúDo you mind if I record?‚Äù I sit down with my back to the rest of the room, isolating my microphone as much as possible from the chatter and hum of the venue. ‚ÄúNot at all,‚Äù Rick tells me. I hit record and introduce him to the microphone.  
  
‚ÄúNow Rick, your voice might sound really familiar to a few listeners. Why is that?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWell if they were ever kids, they may have listened to my recordings as I record audiobooks for kids as Uncle Rick‚Äù

My interviewing skills are more than rough, much farther from the Isaac Chotiner impression I was going for. But it works; a deficit in charm actually makes you fit in more here. I butter him up with questions I‚Äôve seen him answer a few dozen times, and he answers them like he did a decade ago. He enters a comfortable rhythm, even boosting my own confidence.

After knocking down a few of the easy questions, I go for something a little out of his wheelhouse. I ask what he thinks about homeschooled kids who are now grown and speaking out against it.  
  
‚ÄúUltimately it‚Äôs because God loves the family and Satan hates it and he‚Äôs using human instruments to attack it right now, but it‚Äôs grown anyway because it‚Äôs God‚Äôs movement ‚Ä¶ We got state education laws sensitized to Homeschoolers‚Äù

I go back to the well of soft questions, and give him an opportunity to crow about his time in leadership. I swing the pendulum back with my next question. When the scandal of Josh Duggar sexually assaulting his sisters became public in 2014, [Rick had come to their defense, posting that ‚ÄúAbuse is the new racism.‚Äù](https://homeschoolersanonymous.net/2015/05/24/heavs-rick-boyer-defends-josh-duggar-and-bill-gothard-claims-abuse-is-the-new-racism/)

‚ÄúI remember the 2013 \[HEAV\] conference, which was headlined by the Duggars. You were a board member at that time‚Äîdid you have any strong thoughts about what the Duggars meant for homeschooling? And how does that intersect with the post-COVID homeschooling and the new kind of challenges from homeschool grads?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a broad question.‚Äù  
  
Yes it is, Rick!

‚ÄúStart out with the Duggars. I don‚Äôt know the Duggars real well, but I‚Äôm acquainted with them. I‚Äôve been in their home. I consider Jim Bob and his wife personal friends, although I seldom see them.‚Äù  
  
Rick‚Äôs demeanor begins a slow evolution now. He begins to answer faster than he can think, calling people he says he doesn‚Äôt know very well his personal friends in the next breath.  
  
‚ÄúI think the enemy jumped on the failure of their oldest son and made as big a deal out of it as they could because they‚Äôre not a godly group by and large. And I think they‚Äôre always eager to attack anybody who‚Äôs anything like an icon in the Christian family movement. The Duggars are like I am. They‚Äôre sinners ‚Ä¶ I mean, they had a TV show and all that. So they were considered icons, representative of the Christian family movement, the homeschool movement. And the enemies of God jumped on their natural failures, which we all have, and made the biggest deal out of it they could.

I can‚Äôt really say I know a lot about what the response has been movement-wide. I know that people forget things awful fast. And since their television show went off the air several years ago, I think it would be interesting to find out that there‚Äôs an awful lot of people who‚Äôve never heard of them. So I don‚Äôt think a lot of lasting damage was done.‚Äù  
  
I wonder how much of his answers are only about the Duggars. A decade ago, HSLDA quietly pushed Rick off. But this weekend he gets to share the top bill with [one of their board members, Heidi St. John](https://web.archive.org/web/20250603012453/https://hslda.org/bio/heidi-st-john). People really do forget things awful fast.  
  
‚ÄúAnd I pray for them. I think they did a lot of good. It‚Äôs a shame that their oldest son had the issues that he did. But how many families have raised 18 good kids who have never gone overboard and done terrible things? So I‚Äôm not saying‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
He trails off, looking into the distance. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Ä¶‚Äù Rick is now overcome with slight unnatural movements, his face exhibiting seizure-like symptoms, and I begin to wonder if I‚Äôm about to call an ambulance. I don‚Äôt interrupt.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not qualified to judge other people ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not surprised that when a failure appeared in their family that the media jumped on it. Because by and large, the secular media is an instrument of the devil. And ultimately, it‚Äôs a spiritual battle.‚Äù  
  
His answer finally concludes. The Duggar parents along with every single member of their community covered up their son‚Äôs crimes for over a decade, enabling him to continue harming others. Rick doesn‚Äôt just seem unaware of this, he appears unable to comprehend it.

# Phase 2

The questions seemed to have drained the life from Rick. He looks defeated, any excitement from earlier has now evaporated. I begin my next phase and ask short and direct questions from here on out, curious when Rick will realize the nature of the interview.  
  
‚ÄúHow long did you serve on the board?‚Äù  
  
‚Äú14 years.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhen did you leave?‚Äù  
  
‚Äú2016.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDid you leave for any reason?‚Äù

We sit in silence for eleven seconds. His facial contortions accelerate.  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I want to comment on that.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when you stopped going to conventions?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when you stopped going to conventions?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo, I went to the convention a year or two after that. I spoke a year or two after that.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúBut then you stopped?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been since then. I couldn‚Äôt tell you how many times.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúSo what made you go on a break?‚Äù

Another moment of silence.  
  
‚ÄúWell, usually when I went, it‚Äôs because I was asked to speak. And I didn‚Äôt get asked to speak every year. I did attend a time or two when I wasn‚Äôt asked to speak, but not every year.  
  
‚ÄúBut you stopped getting invites?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúBut you stopped getting invites?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been invited the last few years.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIs there any reason?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to ask them, whoever‚Äôs in charge of the convention.‚Äù

Silence.  
  
‚ÄúNo other reason?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAsk them, brother.  
‚Ä¶  
Now are you going to tell me why you‚Äôre really doing this interview?‚Äù

*(*[Video of exchange here](https://homeiswherethehatredis.com/2025/06/03/live-from-the-2025-massachusetts-homeschool-convention-its-disgraced-homeschool-leader-rick-boyer/)*)*

The jig is up. I don‚Äôt answer. ‚ÄúDid anything happen in Virginia around 2016 and 2017?‚Äù

‚ÄúA lot of things happened in Virginia.  
‚Ä¶What did you say your last name was?‚Äù

A woman taps Rick on the shoulder as she walks past, ‚ÄúJust letting you know, you have 15 minutes till your last session,‚Äù Rick lifts his arm and pulls back the suit cuff covering his watch, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre right! Well, this has been very interesting.‚Äù

We started too late. Fuck. I don‚Äôt have time for the flow chart on my legal pad. Unsure what to do, I decide to just dig in and continue with the same tactic, a mistake I will later regret. ‚ÄúNo reason?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou with Homeschoolers Anonymous?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm homeschooled.‚Äù Jesus. That blog shut down six years ago. ‚ÄúWhy did you leave in 2016?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is really interesting. Why do you think I left in 2016?‚Äù

I glance down at my flow chart and check the node reading ‚Äú**HE** needs to say why he left.‚Äù For some reason I felt this was important enough to draw only one exit branch. Rick then makes an observation I had been wondering myself.

‚ÄúThis is interesting. As far as I know this is the first time this has happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù

Rick is smart enough to recognize the expiring time on the game clock gives him an opening to regain control of the interview. Now at ease, he takes advantage and attempts to start asking me questions.

‚ÄúAre you a Christian?‚Äù

Chotiner would never allow himself to be put in this position. Disgusted with myself, I opt for the same brick wall defense Rick is using, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm homeschooled.‚Äù

‚Äú*Ahhh*.‚Äù My answer has given Rick some sort of clarity. Going off his previous answers, I have an idea what he thinks this means. ‚ÄúSo who are you with?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDid anything happen in 2016?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWho are you with?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm with myself.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not.‚Äù

We have reached an impasse. He asks for my last name, which I decline to offer. He again insists I am with Homeschoolers Anonymous, [the blog that he tried to sue in 2017](https://www.courthousenews.com/ministry-head-says-bloggers-defamed/). Vendors are beginning to break their booths down. Rick readies to leave for his last workshop and lets me know he is ready to wrap this up.  
  
‚ÄúWell, God bless you. That‚Äôs all I can say.‚Äù

I squeeze everything I can out of our last few seconds. ‚ÄúWhat happened in 2016? Why did you stop getting invites? Did HEAV ask you to step down or did you do it on your own?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know what I wonder? I wonder if I‚Äôm going to end up finding out why you‚Äôre asking all this ‚Ä¶ I better go. God bless you.‚Äù Rick sticks his hand in my direction for a handshake, ‚ÄúNo hard feelings.‚Äù

I‚Äôm indifferent on handshakes, but not with this one. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay‚Äù I tell him.

The weekend had been spent warning attendees of an impending battle with evil, literal warfare over which the very soul of our nation and children weighed in the balance, and Rick, determined I was on the opposing side of this battle, offered to shake my hand.

It was time for me to go. I left my card on his table as he whispered some instructions to the pre-teen girls tasked with selling his books and audiobook memberships. On my way out I leave another card on the HSLDA table and ask if they could tell Jim I‚Äôve been trying to get in touch with him.  
  
‚ÄúJim Mason? The President?‚Äù

\* \* \* \* \*

I was ready to get the fuck out of here and hopped in the Jeep Compass rental. But after exiting onto the highway, I had a second thought and turned around. The convention wasn‚Äôt over yet. I popped into Rick‚Äôs final workshop to grab my last shot of the convention. I‚Äôll arrive at the airport with plenty of time to catch my flight home.

https://preview.redd.it/qc6m3ib89q4f1.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2876e8f91d26d37fcfcb22c24ac96cf23239502

\* \* \* \* \*

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have any time. You should have gotten here sooner.‚Äù The TSA agent is bemused as to why anyone without an ID would show up this late to their flight. I‚Äôm shuffled between a battery of TSA stations, where they tell me I‚Äôm going to miss my flight. I purchase a new ticket, the price of my trip now doubled. Amidst an ongoing series of phone calls and discussions between TSA agents, a video of Kristi Noem reminding me to have a Real ID loops on the TV screens above. Finally a decision is made, ‚ÄúJust run his bags through the extra screening.‚Äù I arrive at my gate eight minutes later, passing the closed jet bridge to my original flight.

**From Fringe, To Movement, To Enduring Institution**

>We need to take back the culture ourselves and not depend upon the legislature to do so ‚Ä¶ What we need to do is to foster more of home schooling ‚Ä¶ I am talking about really separating ourselves from the filth. We need to invent institutions that will replace the ones that are defective.  
  
\- Paul Weyrich, father of the New Right, to Michael Farris in 1999

I was, if it wasn‚Äôt obvious, not prepared for this trip. It was a side branch to a side branch of my original plans. When I learned of Rick‚Äôs attendance, I quickly made the decision to travel. Assumptions I held prior did not return from my trip fully intact‚Äîthe most heartbreaking revelation being that I‚Äôm no Chotiner (and that I maybe shouldn‚Äôt pretend to be). More though, I at first found the convention quaint, like the Homeschool movement from the past. While other larger conventions put on a (deeply shallow) show of welcoming homeschoolers outside the movement, there was no pretense here. Upon reflection, I do not view this event solely as signs of schisms or even a movement in stagnation, but as a view into the geological timescale of that movement, of the fertile soil being cultivated for an institution to form. An institution distinct from the soil it grows from, cultivated and groomed by its constant gardeners found in MASSHopes and HEAVs across the nation, by its Rick Boyers‚Äîand those who cover for them.

But an institution that is willfully blind to the harm it unleashes on its own product is blind to the tension it will one day face from that product. Rick was unable to believe I was not with an inactive blog from a decade ago for the same reason the HSLDA booth was unaware CRHE is entirely under the direction of homeschool alumni. An institution that exists to avoid confrontation with reality and replace it with its own will by necessity be unable to confront the reality of its own product. It will manufacture bolder realities to keep the tension at bay and wield increasing power at the same time it works to be seen as ethereal and the work of individual actors. The institutional machinery operating in our backyards‚Äîits homeschool days and Capitol visits and conventions‚Äîfree from knowing the reality of its own product, for 

>We are no longer a social movement working towards making homeschooling legal, socially acceptable, and mainstream. We have checked that box. Perhaps we are instead now an enduring, successful institution, whose purpose, in part, is to offer an antidote to many of the social ills that surround us.

>\- HSLDA President Jim Mason, 2023 National Leadership Conference

As I asked Rick increasingly probing questions, the comfort drained from his appearance, his jaw swung wildly, his pauses between thoughts grew longer. On display was his mind grappling with the confrontation with himself he avoids every waking moment. He was betrayed by his belief that the holy ground where he stood belonged to him. That the institution built with his own hands would offer him refuge from the terror of reality it was created to replace. But before our conversation‚Äôs end, Rick *did* find refuge, and I had allowed it. I let the interview conclude without acknowledging the harm he had committed. The tension left unearthed and continuing to rot; he found a way out. As the charade of the interview collapsed, Rick no longer had to grapple with his own conscience. He could escape accountability by inventing a Devil. Where across from him sat the work of his own product, he replaced it with Satan, and offered to shake his hand.‚ô¶",2,1748980532.0,HomeschoolRecovery,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and effectiveness of a commercial water filter are persistent by its key features. Understanding these technical aspects is crucial for selecting the right filter for your business.

**Filtration Capacity**

Filtration capacity refers to the amount of water a filter can process within a specific timeframe, often measured in gallons per day (GPD) or gallons per minute (GPM). High-demand businesses, such as large restaurants or hotels, require filters with significant capacity to meet peak usage requirements. Conversely, smaller operations like cafes or office spaces might find lower-capacity filters sufficient. Selecting a filter with adequate capacity ensures a consistent supply of purified water without compromising flow rate or filtration efficiency.

**Filtration Technology**

Commercial water filters employ various filtration technologies to remove contaminants. Common technologies include activated carbon filtration, wich effectively reduces chlorine, sediment, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and unpleasant tastes and odors. Reverse osmosis (RO) systems utilize pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane, removing a wide range of contaminants, including dissolved solids, bacteria, and viruses. Ultraviolet (UV) sterilization systems use UV light to disinfect water, eliminating bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms without adding chemicals. Choosing the right technology depends on the specific contaminants present in your water source and the desired level of purification.

**Filter Cartridge Lifespan**

The lifespan of a filter cartridge is a critical factor affecting maintenance frequency and operational costs. Some filters require cartridge replacement every few months, while others can last for a year or more. Filters with longer lifespans reduce downtime and minimize the expense of frequent replacements. It's critically important to consider the cost of replacement cartridges when evaluating the overall cost-effectiveness of a commercial water filter system.

**Pressure requirements**

Commercial water filters require a certain water pressure to operate effectively. ensuring your water supply meets the minimum pressure requirements of the filter is essential for optimal performance. Low water pressure can considerably reduce filtration efficiency and flow rate. Boost pumps can be used to increase water pressure in areas with insufficient supply.

**Certifications and Standards**

Look for filters that are certified by reputable organizations like NSF International or the Water Quality Association (WQA). These certifications ensure that the filter meets rigorous performance standards and is safe for use in drinking water applications. Certifications provide assurance that the filter effectively removes contaminants and does not introduce harmful substances into the water.

**Installation and Maintenance**

The ease of installation and maintenance is an important consideration,particularly for businesses with limited technical expertise. Some filters are designed for simple DIY installation,while others require professional installation. Regular maintenance, such as cartridge replacement and system cleaning, is necessary to ensure optimal performance and longevity of the filter. Opting for a filter with user-friendly maintenance procedures can save time and money.Key features of commercial water filters include:

* High filtration capacity suitable for varying business sizes
* Advanced filtration technologies for targeted contaminant removal
* Long-lasting filter cartridges to minimize maintenance
* Adherence to industry certifications and standards

I'm running a composting workshop at the local farmer's market this Friday and I put this guide together (in pamphlet form--I'll share that, too, once I get it done). First I'll just share the guide, since I think it'll be helpful for /r/composting, too:

# Composting is Easy!  
  
[Insert poorly-drawn picture of a compost pile with a chicken on it. [Here's the sketch!](https://i.imgur.com/V2gUPAI.jpeg)]

## Compost has four basic needs:  
  
**Browns**: carbon-rich materials like leaves, wood chips, sawdust (from untreated wood), straw, and shredded cardboard or paper  
**Greens**: nitrogen-rich materials like kitchen scraps, coffee grounds, grass clippings, misc. garden/lawn waste, and herbivorous animal manures  
**Oxygen**: Keep oxygen in your pile by turning it regularly or giving it ventilation  
**Moisture**: It should never be drenched, but it should always be damp  
  
## Why should I compost?  
  
To obtain a yield or ‚Äúget something from nothing.‚Äù Your household generates food waste, so why not get a useful soil amendment from it?  
  
To reduce waste. By composting your kitchen scraps and other organic waste, you can save money on disposal fees and send less to the landfill.  
  
## How do I compost?  
  
There are a few different ways. Pick one that works best for you.   
  
**Bacterial/‚Äùhot‚Äù composting (the Berkeley method)**: for the fastest compost, mix equal parts ‚Äúbrowns‚Äù and ‚Äúgreens,‚Äù ensure everything is moist (but not too wet!), and pile it up. Wait four days, then turn every two days. This compost can be ready in as soon as three weeks!  
  
Turning every two days is not necessary, but it does speed up decomposition. If temperatures rise above 160¬∞F and you do not turn it, this can kill the composting bacteria, slowing the process.  
  
**‚ÄúCold‚Äù composting**: this is a mixture of bacterial, fungal, and worm (or vermi-) composting. It is incredibly simple to start:  
  
* Wet down leaves as you pile them up this fall (or use other ‚Äúbrowns‚Äù)  
* Mix in kitchen scraps and yard waste as you go  
* That‚Äôs it!  
  
This is great if you aren‚Äôt worried about how much compost you get or how soon you‚Äôll get it. It will take a year or more and will lose a lot of volume, but it needs little maintenance. Add kitchen scraps, throw some ‚Äúbrowns‚Äù on top, and leave it alone.  
  
Earthworms will move in on their own, but consider adding some specialized composting worms, such as those from healthyplant.org of Fremont, MI or countryrootsltd.com of Paris, MI.  
  
**Indoor worm bin**: this is great for people who don‚Äôt have space to compost outdoors or who want to continue ‚Äúcold‚Äù composting over winter.  
  
In short: fill a bin that has aeration and drainage with bedding (shredded paper, leaves, or finished ‚Äúhot‚Äù compost), add some composting worms, and add kitchen scraps, buried an inch or two, as you generate them.  
  
See the ""what can I/can't I compost section"" for details about what you can and can‚Äôt feed worms.  
  
## Structures/Methods  
  
**Pile on the ground, with or without chickens**: This doesn‚Äôt keep pests out and doesn‚Äôt give as much aeration, but the price is right! Chickens love managing these piles. Pile ‚Äòem up and let chickens peck them down.  
  
**Enclosure**: Many different enclosures are available online or at hardware stores, but this can be as simple as a circle of welded wire fence or three pallets fastened together.  
  
**Tumbler**: These are small round bins designed with a crank for easy rotating or ‚Äútumbling.‚Äù Available at hardware stores or online, or try to make one yourself with a big drum. They‚Äôre good at keeping pests out, but most don‚Äôt store a lot of material.  
  
**Indoor worm bin**: This can be as simple as a plastic tote with some holes drilled into it for aeration or as fancy as a multi-tiered system you order online. It‚Äôs easy to keep in a dark place in your house (I keep mine in a closet!)  
  
**Trench composting**: dig a hole in your garden, add kitchen scraps, and cover them up. Make sure the scraps are at least 12‚Äù ‚Äì 18‚Äù deep to ensure vermin don‚Äôt find them.  
  
## What can I compost?  
## What can‚Äôt I compost?  
  
Technically, anything organic will decompose into compost. (‚ÄúOrganic‚Äù here doesn‚Äôt mean food made using organic practices, but rather material that comes from anything alive.) However‚Ä¶  
  
If you‚Äôre new to compost or are worried about pests, you should avoid animal products like meat or dairy. These smell bad, attract pests, and can cause pathogens like E. coli or Salmonella to remain.  
  
Worms don‚Äôt like onions/garlic, meat, dairy, oily foods, or citrus. Bread, rice, or other foods that quickly get moldy might also be problematic in a worm bin.  
  
However, if you‚Äôre cold composting, these things that worms dislike are good to go, as bacteria and fungus will take care of anything the worms don‚Äôt like.  
  
For cold or hot composting, leaves (shredded leaves break down faster), weeds (that have not gone to seed), grass clippings, coffee grounds, and kitchen scraps are a great place to start.  
  
## Common Problems  
  
**It smells bad**: This might mean your pile is too wet, there is too much ‚Äúgreen‚Äù material, or not enough oxygen. Mix the pile to make it fluffy or mix in more ‚Äúbrowns‚Äù it can use to absorb the ‚Äúgreens‚Äù or the moisture. Also, make sure you don‚Äôt put animal products in‚Äîthey stink when they break down!  
  
**Something‚Äôs getting into my compost!**: Some animals see your compost as a delicious buffet. Make sure these materials are buried under enough ‚Äúbrowns‚Äù or find an enclosure that will keep them out.  
  
**Flies are everywhere!**: Make sure any of the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù materials are buried under enough ‚Äúbrowns.‚Äù  
  
**My pile won‚Äôt heat up**: Make sure you have enough materials (at least 1 cubic yard, or 3‚Äô x 3‚Äô x 3‚Äô), the right ratios (1-4 parts ‚Äúbrowns‚Äù to 1 part ‚Äúgreens‚Äù), and the right moisture level: damp, but not soaked.

So, there's the guide. Please do correct me if you think I've mistaken anything or forgotten anything important. It's a tri-fold pamphlet, so one sheet of paper front and back, and I don't think I can pack much more in, but I can try. I also plan to make a companion video I link to on the pamphlet, and I'm sure I'll post that here too.  
  
I plan to have a table with a mini worm bin on it ([here it is!](https://i.imgur.com/NVnsXyZ.jpeg)), some common kitchen scraps, a bit of charcoal (biochar) as a conversation starter, a chicken toy, and some crappy sign that I put together and duct tape to the front of the table (hey, I'm no artist!).  
  
On the ground I'll have a real live compost pile (a very small pile of leaves), another one (a small pile of shredded leaves wrapped in some fencing), some finished, sifted compost (I guess to show off? I don't know), and some plants I'll be selling. And a manure fork stabbed into the ground, I guess as a decoration? 
  
Also plan to bring: various denominations of cash, a rake/snow shovel for cleanup, bins/bags for cleanup, a hat, a chair, a water bottle, and a bucket for collecting compost...to actually compost when I get home.  
  
What am I missing? I've never been part of a farmer's market before or ran a composting workshop, so I'd love any of your thoughts! I'm already a little annoyed about how much work I've put into this for free, but eh, it'll be fun, and I'm sure I'll use this pamphlet in the future.

1l2lakz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1l2lakz/tw_self_harm_my_ex_pwbpd_sent_me_a_package_after/,*TW: Self Harm* My ex pwbpd sent me a package after going no contact,"I (32F) have been no-contact (blocked everywhere) with my ex pwbpd (38F) since May 22.

The breakup was initiated by her on May 16, and I had finally had enough and blocked her on May 22. During the breakup she told me she had bought me something for my apartment and wanted me to have it. I received a notice that I had a package today so I went to pick it up. I knew it was from her as I hadn‚Äôt ordered anything. I met my friend for coffee to open it with me as I was scared it would make me upset.

Before I blocked her, she told me she self-harmed the night she broke up with me and it made me feel sick. She also tried to make me feel guilty about having herpes (she discovered she had HPV and tried to tell me it was related to herpes - this is medically not possible). I realized in that moment I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to handle this anymore and it was a manipulation tactic. When I tried to tell her I was upset, she made it about her and how me being upset made her feel bad.

I opened the package today and she bought me a vintage playboy magazine. I used to have a big collection, but lost most of them when I was robbed last year, so on the surface the gift seems thoughtful (more thoughtful than other gifts I had received from her before which seemed focused on her interests).

There was no note in the package, she simply put the envelope the magazine came in into a different one and shipped it to me. Based on when the magazine was originally shipped, she bought it for me days before breaking up with me, and shipped it to me a week after full blocked no-contact.

It‚Äôs a nice gesture, but I am not reaching out to her. I‚Äôll be the bad guy if I say thank you and break no-contact, and I‚Äôll be the bad guy if I don‚Äôt. She will only interpret my no contact as me being mean/cruel to her or punishing her, not because I was/am upset and hurt so there‚Äôs no point. It‚Äôs been hard for me to move on because I really wanted it to work and I can‚Äôt move backwards.

The other thing is like, I blocked her, sure, but if she really wanted to contact me and actually talk there are ways to do so. She could have written a note with the magazine. She could call me from a different phone. There are ways. It‚Äôs easier that there wasn‚Äôt a note, it felt colder, but then I wonder why send it at all?

I‚Äôm taking it easy this afternoon because the whole thing made me feel really ‚Äúoff.‚Äù I still feel bad I had to cut off contact, but more so that it had to happen that way to protect my peace. I‚Äôm sad it didn‚Äôt work out. I really tried. I do genuinely hope she finds the support she needs to work on herself and take care of her mental health.",1,1748979842.0,BPDlovedones,5,1.0,False

We held the funeral at my sister's house, where he passed away. My mom, siblings, nephe's and nieces were all together for the first time in years. My family has always been the type to cope with loss through laughter and most of the time I appreciate that but this time it really got to me. So here's what happened. While everyone was busy, an old lady came by to pay respect, turns out she was my sister's landlord. She mentioned that she forgot her glasses and cound't see very well. I offered her coffee and we ended up having a little chat about my dad. My mom and my brother joined in the conversation and right before she left she looked at me and said ""You're so pretty"". Now to give you context, I'm very aware that I'm the ugliest in the family, I'm not trying to put myself down, it's just the truth. My siblings got the beautiful mix mostly from my mom and a little from my dad's features and my mom herself is gorgeous and she knows it. When it came to me the youngest, everyone jokes that my mom ran out of ink and I ended up looking like my dad, and let me tell you that my dad's features were fine for a man but on a girl? Well, not so much. I've heard it in a thousand different ways growing up, both subtle and direct. It's affected my self-esteem than I ever let on.

So when that lady said I was pretty, my brother made a joke of it. He started calling me 'The most beautiful sibling' and immediately told the whole family. They ran with it. I laughed along at first, but it kept going. When I walked into the kitchen someone announced 'Here comes the most beautiful daughter'. Everyone cracked up. They even called my other sister who couldn't make it and told the story again just to laugh about it again. Later, the landlord came back with her glasses this time and brought food. My brother loudly called me saying I should be the one to greet her because 'The most beautiful daughter should welcome the guests' . They were clearly waiting to see the lady's reaction now that she could actually see me I just locked myself in the bedroom. Even during dinner, it didn't stop, I just lost my appetite. I pleaded with my mom to stop and please tell my siblings to knock it off. She just laughed and said I shouldn't be so sensitive that at least I was helping everyone to feel better. How about me? I was grieving too. And now, when I think about my dad's funeral, I don't just think of losing him I'm also reminded how I was humiliated.

The reason I'm writing this now is because my dad's death anniversary is this month, and we usually gather to celebrate his life and without fail my family reminds everyone about this. But honestly I'm so done. I'm planning not to attend this year, I'll remember my dad on my own. I just can't handle being the punchline again.",16,1748979817.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.94,False

Reddit, I'd love your thoughts. Do I have a case for a personal injury suit here? 

The details:

 I was burned badly at a large chain hotel from coffee made in the in-room coffee maker. When I took a sip, it was so hot that I jolted, spilling the coffee down my chest. I suffered a serious, painful 3rd degree burn down my chest.¬†

I went to urgent care on¬† and 02/28/23 and received a 3rd degree burn diagnosis, although my transcripts just say ""burn.""

Due to major blistering, I was unable to wear a bra or regular clothing for 2 weeks. I am a self-employed event planner and had to cancel work events, resulting in loss of income.¬†

I still have scars from this incident.

I have photos from the week after the burn that demonstrate the severity.¬†",1,1748979750.0,legaladvice,2,0.67,False
1l2l910,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1l2l910/ultraprocessed_foods_arent_bad_for_you_theyre/,Ultra-processed foods aren't bad for you. They're just easier to overconsume.,"I read an article today in the Wall Street Journal titled ""Why Some Ultra-Processed Foods Go Down So Easily, So Fast"" and it crystalized the thought from my title for me.  When I see articles about ultra-processed foods, obesity (and obesity related illnesses) is almost always the negative health effect that they point to.

If weight loss is ultimately about calories in and calories out (and it is), then there's not something inherently bad about ultra-processed foods. I totally believe that it's much easier to consume larger quantities of ultra-processed food. Whether it's the salt-sugar-fat content or the textures that make it go down easier, that's what it amounts to. It's easier to overconsume, but consuming 500 calories of Pringles everyday beyond your TDEE is not going to do much different to you consuming 500 over-TDEE calories of baked potato. The only real difference is that it's a LOT easier to eat 500 calories of pringles.

There are no good and bad foods.  It's just how much you eat of them.  Ice cream is not ""bad"", but if that's all I ate then my nutrition would suck.  That is also true of rice cakes. If all I ate were rice cakes, my nutrition would suck. No one says rice cakes are a ""bad"" food.  

There are no foods that are designed to be addictive. Even if you're with me up to this point, you may be balking. Certainly, this ultra-processed food is deliberately formulated to make people want to eat it. That's what we call cooking, that's not an evil conspiracy to make you fat. Yes, food manufacturers add salt, sugar, fat and flavors to make it more likely a consumer will buy their food. Clothing manufacturers also choose products that they think consumers are more likely to want and therefore buy, but we don't think of them as nefarious and unscrupulous drug dealers like we do food manufacturers.  You know who does actually sell addictive substances for food? Wherever you get your coffee. Caffeine is an actual chemical that can be addicting.

What I think it boils down to is that we continue to look for things to externalize responsibility for our weight.",0,1748979740.0,loseit,26,0.14,False

It‚Äôs been a month now and I still haven‚Äôt completely recovered, but I can see the things clearer and I am better due to the new job. In points, I tried to describe what is the worst I experienced: 
- passive aggressive attitude by managers;
- compliments when they need something from you, insults and bullying when you are not their favourite anymore.
- gossip: oh this is the main issue, gossip, fake stories, you can be a hero one day and a shit for months;
- tills never ending for months as punishment or because they don‚Äôt like you, but they never give feedback;
-No work-life balance: your phone rings, work chat, personal messages, continuosly roaster change;
-You may be scheduled for 8 days in a row, one day off, then 5 days in a row. Roaster is hard.
-Morning shift with such rush and not enough staff, tall pallets and no time to lift properly following the manual handling training.
-Bakery is nice is some stores, you may even work in two, in some places you run like crazy to bake for the same day and for the following, if you don‚Äôt finish on time you are lazy. If favourites don‚Äôt finish on time, it means that it was too much to do and the following baker will finish for them.
-You know when you clock in but you don‚Äôt know when you are out. You may start at 5, but you can go home at 4,5. Or you can start at 1 and never know if you go home before midnight. Some stores were very precisly with that, I am honest, I was often at home on time, but not when they try to save as much hours as they can.
-Toxic environment: I can say that this happened in 50% of my experiences and I am still in touch with some of my colleagues; on the other hand, I still don‚Äôt wanna see the others, negative, they worked so much time that I don‚Äôt blame them, they make you so negative and treat other coworkers as they‚Äôve been treated;
-Unrealistic time to performe more than one task at the time. 
-Drs machine whistle is something that continuosly gave me headache.
- Say yes 90 times to change shifts and cover, but try to say no once or be sick that you will be the worst employee.
-Lost the count of how many time I burned out. 
-Training: really, 404, not found. I had a brilliant baker trainer for afternoon bakery and manual handling. And that‚Äôs all. They don‚Äôt show you anything but when they need you, you are supposed to know how to do it and be super fast and no mistakes, which is sick. 

Just an advice, before to apply go to shop there, have a look at the staff, try to talk to them. Some stores are very nice and friendly, respectful, and you will see the same smiling faces for ages, some other stores change staff every week and that would be a red flag. 

I lost the enthusiams to do anything, like a walk, going out for a coffee, reading, meeting my friends, I lost the focus and the consciousness. I  just wanna make you aware that it is better to have a look to your future workplace, not just asking during the interview because they may lie.",4,1748979489.0,lidl,0,1.0,False

I usually woke up before her to start the coffee maker, moving quietly in the dark as if that would soften my presence. I knew she was waiting for me to wake her, and I loved being the first part of her day.

We‚Äôd stand in the kitchen, the lights still off, watching the sun rise as we talked‚Äîsometimes softly, sometimes about nothing in particular‚Äîright up until the last seconds before I had to leave for work. The thought of continuing those conversations carried me through the monotony of my day, right until I pulled back into the driveway. I‚Äôd switch off my headlights, just in case she‚Äôd fallen asleep on the couch waiting for me to come home.

When I came through the door, she would greet me with a warm embrace and eventually offer dinner in a Tupperware container, making sure I ate. We would continue talking throughout the night, recapping our days, discussing friends, family, co-workers, and anything we had seen online recently. She always listened to me, and I did the same for her‚Äîat least, I hope I was as good a listener as she was.

I never felt fulfilled in my job, and I often found myself drifting into stressful topics that led to moments of silent dismay. I tried not to let it bother me too much. I always wanted children with her, but I felt we needed to build up our savings a bit more first. Although our new house was small, I dreamed of adding an extension to create more space for a family, especially since we had enough land to make it possible. At times, I felt responsible for our challenges, as if she deserved better than the difficulties we faced.

To counter these feelings, I would put on her favorite childhood show, *The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh*. She would light up whenever we watched it, and its wholesomeness always cheered me up too. Many nights, we would fall asleep with it playing in the background, only to wake up and repeat our routine the next day.

One day, when I came home from work and opened the door, she was standing there with a look I recognized immediately.

Looking down at the floor, as if afraid I might say no, she asked, ‚ÄúCan we get a dog?‚Äù

As much as I wanted to say, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs going to walk it? And clean up after it?‚Äù I knew she had me, and I would do anything she wanted. She worked from home, and we didn‚Äôt have any pets. I had a feeling this was going to come up sooner or later.

The next couple of nights were spent researching breeds and local shelters, and it was so much fun. We reminisced about childhood pets, shared our fond memories with them, and discussed what we should be cautious of as we embarked on this venture. It felt like we were little kids who couldn‚Äôt sleep the night before Christmas.

We visited a few shelters, and it seemed like she was on the verge of tears because we couldn‚Äôt take home every animal we saw. Most of the dogs weren‚Äôt quite what we were looking for, but we kept searching. After visiting our third shelter, we found her. She was lying in her kennel with a polite, matter-of-fact demeanor, as if we were intruding on her tiny space‚Äîher home, however small it was. She had a blue merle coat, and according to the kennel employee, she was a rough collie and Labrador mix, about a year and a half old. She immediately stood up to greet my wife when she offered her scent, gently licking her hand. She was so sweet. The only problem was that we were short on time due to prior plans. We had only intended to visit, and if we found a dog, we planned to arrange the adoption for the weekend.

But this was different. Despite all our ‚Äúresearch,‚Äù we decided to take a chance, canceled our plans, and brought her home. When we pulled into the driveway and parked, she was hesitant to leave her kennel. We had to carry it into our little living room, open the door, and eventually, she cautiously made her way out into the kitchen, where my wife had placed a small bowl of food for her. By the end of the night, she was lying on the floor of our bedroom upstairs. She felt safe with us, and we felt safe with her.

The next day was a Friday, and fortunately for both of us, we had the day off. The morning started out normally, except I had a little helper who made sure my once-silent routine was now loudly observed. I took her out into our large yard, and I had never seen anything happier. She had so much space to explore and looked so curious and free. Every plant and bug was a new discovery as we soaked in the cool late-summer morning. Once she had finished her business, the late riser was waiting for us in the kitchen with her coffee. Our new guest felt much more comfortable, and we were both excited to welcome her into our lives.

After a short game of fetch, my wife grabbed the car keys and excitedly said she wanted to run out to get some treats and a couple more toys. I laughed and took on the babysitter role as she waved to us while backing down the driveway.

An hour passed, and I began to feel a little concerned, but I figured she might have stopped to pick up breakfast. After two hours had gone by with no word from her, I had already called and texted. When three or four hours had passed, I was calling her every minute. The calls went straight to voicemail. As the sun began to set, I sat on the front porch, staring down the driveway, waiting for any sign of headlights. I called my sister, but she lived an hour away and had to work. She told me she would come by as soon as she got off. Our little guest was just happy to be able to run around and get some attention, which greatly helped in the midst of our growing concern.

When I first saw the headlights coming down our driveway, I shot up and jumped down the steps. I had never felt such a rush of relief. The weight of fear had been like a barbell strapped to my back, impossible to lift.

But as the car turned, I noticed the lights on top. It was black and white, and a surge of anger and embarrassment flooded me. The back of my neck burned white-hot. I couldn‚Äôt comprehend why this was happening. All she had done was go to the store.

Two state troopers pulled up next to me, their car coming to a quiet stop. They stepped out in unison, their movements precise and deliberate. The passenger-side trooper didn‚Äôt say a word as he approached. Gently, he placed an arm around my shoulders, steadying me as I knelt in the yard. His voice was soft, almost a whisper, as he asked, ‚ÄúCan we go inside?‚Äù

I still remember the faint glint of their name tags catching the light, momentarily piercing through my hollow stare. One read Murphy, the other Lancaster.

As she was merging onto a highway, a drunk driver, speeding and switching lanes recklessly, hit her. The impact knocked her off the shoulder of the road and into a tree. She died on impact.

My sister arrived at the house shortly after. One of the troopers gently took her outside to break the news, while the other stayed with me in the front room. They remained until she could compose herself, then left their contact information with her before returning to their duties.

Meanwhile, I hadn‚Äôt moved from the chair in the living room. I couldn‚Äôt move, and I didn‚Äôt want to. My sister draped a blanket around me and refused to leave my side. I wept and occasionally vomited into a bucket she had placed next to me. I neither ate nor slept that night. My sister lit candles in the living room, surrounding me in their glow, and tried to coax our little friend out from her hiding spot under our bed upstairs to feed her.

I still remember the darkness of that night. It should have poured rain, but instead, it was a warm, still evening. The silence was suffocating. The candles‚Äô flames danced in my eyes whenever I chose to open them. The only sound came from my sister, who had fallen asleep on the couch next to me. Her somber snoring broke the stillness, a stark contrast to the silent despair that kept me wide awake.

As the sun began to rise, casting a gentle light through the windows like a tranquil alarm, fatigue finally began to overtake me. My heavy eyes started to close, pulling me into what felt like a new nightmare. But then, I felt a wet sensation on my hand, which hung limply over the arm of the chair.

I sat up slightly, rubbed the gunk from my eyes, and leaned over to see our little guest. And it all started over again‚Äînot the weeping of loss, but the ache of what could have been and what would always stay with me. She had her tennis ball with her, and it felt as though she was saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I chose her name. I wanted her to share in the love I had for the one person I had always wanted to spend every second with. That‚Äôs when I named her Bonnie.

# Entry Two

My mornings were no longer silent. Bonnie had grown accustomed to being fed at a specific time, and she made sure I knew it. It felt like she practically dragged me out of bed and into the kitchen. My once quiet, careful morning routine had turned into a laid-back shuffle to serve her beloved breakfast, always followed by a little conversation between us. Sometimes, it feels like she knows she's the reason I get up each morning, keeping me going when I otherwise wouldn't.

Our morning walks around the property have become the only reason I leave the house. After my workplace found out what happened, they put me on leave to sort things out. It was a kind gesture, but honestly, I don't have any desire to go back. Everything I did for that job was for a greater purpose, and now that purpose is gone. I'll find something different when the time comes.

My sister calls frequently and visits often, usually staying more than one night. Her presence has become familiar, and it shows with Bonnie. She joins us on our walks, which is refreshing, even if it doesn't fix everything. I know she cares, but I also know nothing can really make it better.

When she stays over, she usually gets up before me to give me a little more time to stay in bed. She tends to overfeed Bonnie and play with her in a patronizing way. I can tell Bonnie isn't a fan, but I suppose the company is appreciated. Still, every night I see ghosts, and I can't shake the feeling of hearing her voice calling for me down the hall. It taunts me, reminding me of a wound that will never heal.

One evening, after dinner, I took Bonnie for her usual walk. Normally, we stay within view of the house, but I decided to go a little farther into the woods. I figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt as long as I remembered the way back. Bonnie led the way, per usual, and we made our way through some tall grass onto a rough dirt path shaded by the tree line. We heard a rustling sound nearby, and I assumed it was a squirrel or a rabbit. The silence that followed was deafening, but when the crickets started chirping again, we continued onward. The shadows cast by the trees made me think about returning during the day to escape the heat and harsh sunlight.

As we moved deeper, the rustling returned, this time closer. Bonnie stopped, and so did I. She sensed something was nearby but didn‚Äôt bark. Instead, she backed up toward me, her tail brushing against my legs. The crickets resumed, but Bonnie stayed still.

A coyote burst out of the bushes, startling both of us. Bonnie barked but didn‚Äôt advance. The coyote stood its ground, glaring at us, even taking a few steps forward. Fear crept in. What if there were more? What if they went after Bonnie? I quickly leashed her and retreated back towards the house.

Once we got home, I felt a little embarrassed by the encounter, though I‚Äôm not sure why. Bonnie seemed fine, so to lift her spirits, I decided to play with her for a while. She always told me that fetch was her favorite game, though she‚Äôs shown me a few others. I knew we had to get some playtime in before my sister came and insisted we go to bed. I hate when she gets in between us.

# Entry Three

My sister has pretty much made herself at home, settling into our old living room. I guess it‚Äôs fine, but every time I get a moment alone with Bonnie, our time is interrupted by a phone call‚Äîfrom guess who. She usually comes over on Wednesdays and stays until Sunday morning. Having someone around can be nice, but I can tell Bonnie‚Äôs starting to get tired of her, and honestly, so am I. She‚Äôs just always there. And while I‚Äôm grateful for her help, I‚Äôm also looking forward to when she gives me some space.

I‚Äôve connected with Bonnie in a way my sister wouldn‚Äôt understand. I don‚Äôt think she needs to be here all the time. I‚Äôm doing a little better, but my sister keeps insisting something‚Äôs still wrong. She always says, *""I just don‚Äôt want anything else to happen, as long as I can help it.""* Everything is fine. The fact that she doesn‚Äôt believe me only makes me more upset. I‚Äôm tired of being treated like a child.

Our morning walks have become my only escape from her constant presence. I still think about returning to that shaded area in the woods where the trees block out the light, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready yet. My sister usually watches us from the kitchen window‚ÄîI can always feel her there, like a shadow. Still, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm getting out of bed more often than before.

Recently, after one of our morning walks, my sister excitedly told me about a local dog park she wanted to take me to. I wasn‚Äôt thrilled about the idea. I don‚Äôt trust other people‚Äôs dogs around Bonnie, but she was insistent. She really wanted me to leave the house‚Äîit‚Äôs been a while since I have, and she‚Äôs been the one bringing in groceries while I spend most nights lost in thought.

Apparently, my reluctance was obvious, because she gave me an ultimatum: if I went to the dog park, she‚Äôd leave me alone for the rest of the week, at least until Sunday. If I didn‚Äôt, she‚Äôd come back on Thursday. I knew she was trying to be considerate, so I figured, why not?

It was a short drive across town. I sat next to Bonnie in the back seat, trying to keep her calm because of my sister‚Äôs erratic driving. I could tell she was stressed, but I knew this wouldn‚Äôt take long, and we could get back to our routine.

We pulled into a small parking lot next to the dog park. It wasn‚Äôt too bad‚Äîsmall, but luckily not crowded. I kept Bonnie leashed; I didn‚Äôt want her getting too close to anyone‚Äôs dog. Most people were leaning against the fence near the parking lot, barely paying attention to their dogs, while a few were playing in a small area. My sister rubbed my back, making me jump. She offered to walk Bonnie, but I refused to give up the leash.

A bright yellow tennis ball landed at my feet, and just as I reached down to pick it up, Bonnie grabbed it. I laughed and tried to take it from her mouth when I noticed a pretty Saluki dog standing in front of us, curiously sniffing Bonnie. They exchanged sniffs under my watchful eye, and I kept a firm grip on the leash, ready to pull Bonnie away if anything went wrong. Just then, someone called out,

*""Winnie!""*

When I looked up, I froze. A woman with shoulder-length strawberry-blonde hair was walking toward us. She wore round, wire-frame glasses, and her bright blue eyes met mine as she smiled. Her cheeks flushed slightly, and she brushed her hair back before pointing at the leash.

*""You don‚Äôt have to leash them inside the gates,""* she said. *""I understand though! You never know how these things will go. What‚Äôs her name?""*

I could hardly speak, but luckily, my sister chimed in. She told her Bonnie‚Äôs name and complimented her dog for being ‚Äúcute and fluffy.‚Äù Then, doing me a favor, she said she had left something in the car, adding, *‚ÄúTake care of my brother while I‚Äôm gone.‚Äù*

Her name was Amy, and she worked as a dental assistant in town. She had a special fondness for long walks with her dog, whose name was inspired by a favorite childhood character.

Before I knew it, I found out she was free this Saturday. I don‚Äôt know why, but I‚Äôm excited, even though I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be. When I told my sister, she almost jumped out of the driver‚Äôs seat in excitement. She even promised to babysit Bonnie. I just hope she treats Bonnie well while I‚Äôm gone.

# Entry Four

When I finally had some time to myself, I started to think more about what I had gotten myself into. I‚Äôm not ready to go on a date with anyone right now. I just thought it would be nice to spend time with someone besides my sister for a change.

I haven‚Äôt been this nervous in a long time, and I wasn‚Äôt sure I was ready for something like this. It felt too soon. I figured I‚Äôd let a few days pass and maybe come up with an excuse to get out of it.

Even after some time, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that what I was doing was wrong. I still felt like I was making a mistake. I didn‚Äôt know what to do until my sister called me on Wednesday. As much as she annoys me sometimes, she knows how to calm me down. She reminded me that this didn‚Äôt have to be anything serious if I didn‚Äôt want it to be, and I shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about being attracted to someone. She even extended the time before she‚Äôd check in on me again, which made me feel better. Honestly, I just wanted to get through it and return to spending time with Bonnie.

As the week went on, I just felt worse. I almost came up with an excuse‚Äîlike pretending I was sick or saying something came up with my family‚Äîbut I knew if I went through with it, it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, and I‚Äôd finally get the space I needed. I checked in with Amy the day before, and she seemed excited. Up until then, our communication had been light‚Äîjust a few funny exchanges about dog memes.

I barely slept the night before, but not for the usual reasons. My sister came over a couple of hours early, and I guess she helped lift my mood a little. It felt like I was gearing up for something big, like I was supposed to win some kind of race.

She helped with the dishes while I got dressed. Bonnie helped me pick out a nice shirt, which gave me a little confidence‚ÄîI could feel her cheering me on. But the guilt hit me hard when I realized I was about to leave her behind. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that my sister wouldn‚Äôt take good care of her. I should‚Äôve just come up with an excuse.

When it was time to leave, it felt like I was saying goodbye for good. I backed out of the driveway, waving to my sister and Bonnie. I could see the sadness in Bonnie‚Äôs eyes‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt even come to the car. I kept telling myself it would all be over soon.

Amy and I had agreed to meet at a coffee shop and then take a walk in a nearby park. Before I had decided to have a fit, it seemed like a good idea to get to know her better. Now, I regretted it. Still, I felt the need to show up early so I wouldn‚Äôt keep her waiting‚Äîit seemed like the right thing to do.

I found a table in the corner, feeling out of place as other people worked on their laptops or met with friends. It was the waiting that was the hardest part, like I was an outsider looking in. The quiet hum of conversations around me broke when she finally walked through the door.

She was dressed nicely, with her makeup done and her hair styled. Instinctively, I sat up straighter and checked my breath. I don‚Äôt know why I hadn‚Äôt eaten anything yet. She spotted me and came over for an awkward side-hug before sitting down. I offered to get her a drink while she got settled. She politely declined at first, but I insisted.

She asked for a cappuccino, and since I only drink coffee at home, I panicked and ordered the same thing. I admitted I didn‚Äôt know much about coffee, and she laughed. We talked about small things: where we went to school, childhood interests, favorite movies or shows.

It felt good to have a normal conversation, even though I hadn‚Äôt really watched much since everything happened with Bonnie. Amy told me she got Winnie during a tough time in her life too. I didn‚Äôt go into detail about what happened to me‚ÄîI just called it a *""tough time.""* But when I mentioned how important Bonnie was to me, I started choking up. I excused myself to the bathroom, but I‚Äôm pretty sure she noticed.

When I came back, she placed her hand on mine and said, *‚ÄúPets are family, but they always feel like good friends at first.‚Äù* It made me feel a little better, but she didn‚Äôt really understand how much Bonnie means to me. Honestly, her comment felt like a bit of a reach.

We kept talking about Bonnie and Winnie. She shared her favorite games to play with Winnie, and I mentioned a few of mine, but she didn‚Äôt seem that interested. I noticed her looking away and making odd expressions as I spoke. I wasn‚Äôt sure why. I hadn‚Äôt reacted that way when she was talking.

She quickly changed the subject to the weather, and we decided to head to the park for a walk. It was a beautiful fall afternoon‚Äîgolden leaves, bright sunshine, and a gentle breeze. The summer humidity was gone, making the day feel perfect. I was even more excited because I knew I was closer to going home to Bonnie.

As we walked, Amy talked about how fascinating she found the connection between dogs and humans. She thought it was strange how dogs follow and rely on humans through a leader-follower relationship. In the wild, there isn‚Äôt an alpha dog‚Äîthey hunt and live in packs as a family unit.

That idea stuck with me. I told her how I used to really want a family, how important it was to me at one point. It felt like something I had held close but then lost. I wasn‚Äôt sure anymore if it was something I still wanted.

We walked around the park a couple of times, sharing funny family stories and laughing together. Time slipped by, and before I knew it, the sun was setting. I felt like I was almost at the finish line. She mentioned needing to check on Winnie and said she‚Äôd text me later. We said our goodbyes, and I walked to my car, feeling lighter.

On the drive home, I could feel the pressure on the accelerator‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt wait to see Bonnie and tell my sister how it went. As soon as I pulled up, Bonnie ran out to greet me saying *‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt leave again!‚Äù* I told my sister about the date, and she hugged me so tightly it felt like she was squeezing all the tension out of me. She said she was proud of me, but had to head home soon, though Bonnie still needed to go out. In that moment, I couldn‚Äôt have been happier.

I grabbed Bonnie‚Äôs leash, and we waved goodbye from the porch as we rounded the house, heading toward the field where the trees covered the sky. I felt unstoppable. It was a full moon that night, and I wanted to see the moonlight spill through the canopy as we listened to the crickets and watched the fireflies flicker in the dark.

But when we reached the tree-covered area, the crickets had fallen silent, and the fireflies seemed too shy to show themselves. It was a bit disappointing. I hadn‚Äôt expected much, but I had hoped for more. The night was still beautiful, though‚Äîclouds had rolled in, making it darker than I‚Äôd imagined.

As we stood there, I felt a strange silence settle over us. It felt familiar in a way I couldn‚Äôt quite place. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and a sense of discomfort filled the air. There was this unshakable feeling of danger, like something was watching us.

Bonnie‚Äôs fur bristled, and she positioned herself in front of me, feet wide apart, alert and protective. I sensed something too, and just like before, the bushes across from us rustled. This time, a coyote burst out‚Äîbut not in the cautious way it had before. It leapt at us with aggression, baring its fangs. Bonnie, usually so brave, tucked her tail and retreated behind me.

Without thinking, I scooped her up, adrenaline fueling my strength, and ran back toward the house as fast as I could, fear propelling me forward.

When we got back to the house, Bonnie hid under the kitchen table for most of the night and when I went to sleep she slept underneath the bed. I was humiliated. I don‚Äôt know why I thought anything good could have come from going back there. I don‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt have protected her when it counted. I know that I will never allow that to happen again. I know that I have learned what was needed to protect our family.

# Entry Five

Good morning, Dr. Meier,

It has been quite some time since we last spoke, and I wanted to reach out to express my concerns about my brother, Nick. I deeply respect the importance of client confidentiality in supporting his healing, but I am genuinely worried about his well-being.

After Nick lost Bonnie, I may have been too involved in trying to support him. It felt strange when he named their newly adopted dog ""Bonnie"" so soon after her passing. I understood his desire to preserve her memory, but it seemed like an unfair burden to place on another animal that couldn‚Äôt understand its significance.

I gently suggested other names, but Nick was adamant about naming her Bonnie. At first, it seemed to help him cope, especially during times when I couldn‚Äôt be there. Knowing that this new Bonnie gave him a reason to get outside offered some reassurance, as I feared he might otherwise retreat entirely.

I know I can be pushy, but I felt compelled to encourage him to leave the house and stay active. I worried about him isolating himself and feared the worst. I just wanted to help him in any way I could.

When Nick met Amy, I was thrilled. Seeing him connect with someone on a personal level gave me hope. It was a relief to know he had someone else besides me to lean on.

However, I‚Äôve grown increasingly worried about his attachment to the new Bonnie. He seems overly protective of her and dislikes when I interact with her in ways he doesn‚Äôt approve of, which happens often. He claims to know her ‚Äúfavorite games‚Äù but never explains them. I‚Äôve overheard him having long, detailed conversations with her, but he goes silent the moment he realizes I‚Äôm nearby. It often feels like he‚Äôs discussing something about me with her.

Recently, I witnessed something concerning. Through the kitchen window, I saw him walking Bonnie. He let her off the leash, then sat on the ground in a posture mimicking a dog. Suddenly, he sprinted across the yard on all fours, chasing her. As strange as it sounds, he was surprisingly fast, almost catching up to her.

When I visited him recently, something felt very off. Normally, he greets me at the front porch, but this time, he didn‚Äôt. I waited, then checked the front door, which was unlocked. Inside, the house was in disarray‚Äîuncleaned and foul-smelling, like urine. After calling for him multiple times, he entered through the front door with Bonnie following. Her fur was unkempt, and she desperately needed a bath. Nick looked similarly disheveled‚Äîhis clothes were dirty, and he clearly hadn‚Äôt shaved in some time.

I tried to talk to him, but he ignored me, focusing on feeding Bonnie by pouring food directly on the floor. I attempted to clean up a bit, preparing to mop the floors at least, but he angrily dumped the bucket of water outside, saying Bonnie would get upset if I cleaned. He told me to leave it alone, so I played along, sensing he wasn‚Äôt in the right state of mind.

We sat in the living room‚Äîme on an unstained ottoman and him in a filthy chair. I tried making conversation, hoping he‚Äôd share something about what was going on, but he wouldn‚Äôt budge. He eventually told me he didn‚Äôt need me checking on him anymore. He said he was fine and didn‚Äôt need ‚Äúbabysitting.‚Äù

His dismissal upset me, and I admit I reacted emotionally. I demanded to know what was going on, saying I couldn‚Äôt bear to lose him after already losing a sister-in-law. This triggered an angry outburst. He began yelling, clenching his fists‚Äîbehavior I‚Äôm familiar with as his sibling‚Äîbut something about his cadence felt off.

When Nick stood up to leave the room, I hoped he might calm down. Instead, Bonnie began barking, mirroring his agitation. She bared her teeth and, without warning, lunged at me. Nick grabbed her just in time, making it clear that I needed to leave immediately.

I don‚Äôt want to get my brother or Bonnie into trouble, but I believe it‚Äôs time to reach out to him and encourage him to speak with you. Please let me know if you hear from him.

Thank you,  
Millie Robertson

# Entry Six

Good Morning,

As a precautionary measure before notifying local authorities for a welfare check on Mr. Nick Robertson, I am submitting the following entry from our journaling system, which is required for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.

I have been working with Mr. Robertson to navigate the grieving process, but I am concerned that I have not been successful in helping him fully process his recent traumatic experiences or rebuild trust within his immediate family.

Please review the attached journal entry and ensure it is placed into records accessible to the police, should the need arise.

Thank you,  
Dr. Meier

I have found true happiness living with Bonnie and our family. Together, we have claimed this land, and with time, our numbers will grow. Bonnie has shown me my true purpose, and I will never allow anything‚Äîor anyone‚Äîto stand in the way of that. I‚Äôve proven my loyalty to Bonnie time and time again as we‚Äôve ventured to the farthest reaches of our home.

The forest, where the trees weave their shadows, belongs to us now. When the coyote appeared, I made my presence known. It challenged me, but I responded with a message that its kind will never forget. They now know their place, and some have even fallen in line, following me with a loyalty you could never understand. I lead them, and they obey‚Äîunlike you.

I am more complete than I‚Äôve ever been. The past means nothing. The only thing that matters is what I have now, and I have everything I need. I don‚Äôt need you, and I never did. You were supposed to help me, but all I ever saw was your selfishness, your hollow attempts to justify your work. You don‚Äôt care about me. You only care about your job, about pretending to help people. But you don‚Äôt. You never did.

I know you‚Äôll send others after us once you read this. We will endure no matter what. This land‚Äîour land‚Äîhas outgrown its boundaries, and now our home stretches far beyond where you think it ends. We will thrive, and you will wither. Your weakness has always been your downfall.

# Entry Seven

**Martinsburgh Police Department Report**  
**Case Number:** 078221  
**Date:** 11/17/2026

On November 14th, 2026, at approximately 1530 hours, I was dispatched to (STREET ADDRESS REDACTED FOR PRIVACY) for a welfare check on the occupant, Nicholas ROBERTSON. Upon arrival, OFC LANCASTER and I met with Millie L. ROBERTSON, who was waiting for us outside the residence.

We spoke with Ms. ROBERTSON briefly to understand the situation involving Mr. ROBERTSON. After our conversation, we approached the front door of the residence. Attempting to look through the windows on the front porch proved ineffective due to heavy dirt and grime obscuring the glass.

We knocked on the door, announcing our presence, but received no response. Ms. ROBERTSON attempted to open the door, which was unlocked. As she did, we heard a disturbance around the side of the house. Moments later, approximately twenty dogs came running into view. The dogs were barking aggressively and behaving erratically. OFC LANCASTER and I retreated from the porch to call for backup and animal control. Although the dogs were difficult to manage, none of them bit anyone on the scene.

Once backup officers arrived, efforts were made to distract and corral the dogs, allowing us to safely re-approach the house. Upon opening the front door, we were met by an additional dozen dogs rushing out of the home. The scene inside was chaotic and unsanitary, with dried dirt and feces covering the walls and floors as well as unknown animal remains scattered throughout. The home appeared to be in complete disrepair.

Ms. ROBERTSON became visibly upset and began calling out for her brother while moving through the home. Despite our attempts to keep her outside to ensure her safety, she insisted on searching for him. She eventually ran upstairs, where we followed to remove her from the premises for further investigation.

The upstairs bedroom was in slightly better condition than the rest of the house. While securing the area and escorting Ms. ROBERTSON outside, OFC LANCASTER observed a large torn-apart box on the bedroom floor. Printed on the side of the box was the name ‚ÄúNovatek.‚Äù

OFC LANCASTER conducted a quick search on his phone to learn more about Novatek. The results revealed an article about a Japanese man who had gained widespread attention for commissioning an incredibly lifelike dog costume from the company. The photos accompanying the article showed a costume so detailed it was nearly impossible to distinguish it from a real animal, complete with synthetic fur, anatomically accurate features, and lifelike movements. OFC LANCASTER shared this information with me, and it was at this moment we realized that one of the dogs on the premises was likely Mr. ROBERTSON.

OFC LANCASTER and I quickly exited the home and returned to the front yard, where most of the dogs had already escaped containment. They were seen running across the open field behind the house and into a distant tree line. Among the fleeing dogs, one stopped momentarily, stood upright on its hind legs, and then disappeared into the forest.

# Epilogue

Hello Dr. Meier,

I‚Äôve tried reaching out to you through calls and texts as much as I could after everything that happened. First, I want to sincerely apologize for the media fallout following the investigation into my brother‚Äôs home. We‚Äôre doing our best to restore the property and eventually put it on the market, though it seems like it will be a long time before anyone feels comfortable purchasing it.

That said, I would feel a lot better if I could hear from you. I understand if you‚Äôve been avoiding my attempts to reach out‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt blame you. I feel responsible for so much of this and just want to find a way to make things right.

There‚Äôs something I need to bring to your attention as well. When I searched my brother‚Äôs house the day he disappeared, I found an address written on a piece of paper taped to his old refrigerator. When I looked it up, I discovered it was tied to your name. I hope it‚Äôs an old or temporary residence because I don‚Äôt believe my brother has any reason to seek you out‚Äîor at least, I haven‚Äôt seen any signs of hostility toward you. If you‚Äôve experienced anything unusual, please let me know as soon as you can.

I‚Äôve also heard unsettling reports from friends about hunters being attacked by wild dogs in the woods. One story mentioned a creature moving so quickly and violently it didn‚Äôt seem like anything they‚Äôd ever seen. I‚Äôm hoping these are just exaggerated tales. Still, I hear howling in the woods around my home. Some nights it feels louder and closer, like it‚Äôs calling out to me‚Äîor maybe coming for me. Either way, I know there‚Äôs no place for me there anymore.

Please take care,

1l2kzh3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l2kzh3,"3rd update: new shelf, rug and coffee table. What's next?","Hey, 
We've been tackling our living room and got some good ideas on here over the last few months. 

So since the last update we've added the bookshelf (it was a unit we still had in the garage and just repainted it), added a new rug and coffee table. 

Things still to do: replace the TV unit for a lower unit in a deep dark wood colour, ceiling height curtains and dress the wall behind the sofa. Change the monstera for something higher and more compact, something like a fiddle leaf fig. Dress the bookshelf with more personal items, these are just what we had laying around and look a bit generic. 
Maybe also change the light fitting to something warmer / basketey. 

We had some feature wallpaper ordered but it didn't look right, so we're back looking at art work. We got these black metal frames from a DIY centre (vehind the correct table) which we're thinking of putting up. They are quite cool but might be a bit too cold. I'm thinking some big artwork that pulls in greens from the rug and maybe some dark orange colours. 

Also, soft furninlshings. Again greens and dark orange.

Lucas is my father-in-law‚Äôs bf. Young, nosey as hell and with this talent for making me feel like trash every time he opens his mouth. For instance, my cooking isn‚Äôt good enough, my house isn‚Äôt clean enough, and my marriage, apparently, I should be worshipping Henry cause he‚Äôs the best hubby to ever exist. Every family dinner Lucas shows off his passive-aggressive comments.

But, around, a few weeks ago, things started getting weird. My father-in-law, Will, who‚Äôs usually this chill, quiet guy, started acting‚Ä¶ sketchy. He‚Äôd show up late, have these super-secretive phone calls, and there was this awkward tension every time Lucas was around. Somethin shady was definitely goin on, and my gut was screaming at me to figure it out.

So Last night... I made my move.

We were staying over at Will‚Äôs for the weekend, and I was chilling in the living room (sofa) when I heard him get up in the middle of the night. His voice was low, kinda shaky. So, I closed my eyes , kept my breathing steady, and just‚Ä¶ listened.

He whispers I miss you‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt know how much.

It was way too emotional, too real. And then he drops the name:

Martha.

Bro. Martha. That‚Äôs Will‚Äôs ex-wife (Henry‚Äôs mom). The woman who bailed on the family, like, 10 years ago when Henry was still in high school. My brain was doing cartwheels trying to piece it all together. It felt  one of those trashy TV dramas.

After he hung up, there was this heavy silence, like he was lost in his own thoughts. Meanwhile, I was there, supposedly ""asleep"".

Next morning, I head downstairs, and there‚Äôs Will, sitting at the table, messing with his iPad. Except his hands, Shaking. Will mumbled something about running to Walmart real quick. Meanwhile, Lucas is in the kitchen, all smiley and chipper making coffee.

Lucas: Henry, babe, I made your coffee just the way you like it: little cinnamon, milk barely warm.

Didn‚Äôt even look my way.

Henry? Totally unfazed. just like ""Oh, thanks, Lucas,"" all casual like this is totally normal.

And Im standing there.... Ugh

Anyway, fast forward to when we were packing up to leave. I made up some excuse about forgetting my charger in Will‚Äôs car (before he goes to Walmart) and snuck my GoPro in there to record.

Here I am, just finished listening to what it picked up. And‚Ä¶ oh my gosh. Martha is a master manipulator. Will‚Äôs head-over-heels for her, even after she left. He poured his heart out, saying how his thing with Lucas started as a way to escape, but deep down he‚Äôs always loved Martha.

 She got mad at first, then calmed down, all creepy, and told Will he needed to ‚Äúpurify‚Äù himself to prove his love.  what does that even mean??

I have this gut feeling it‚Äôs got something to do with Lucas. And honestly.. I hate that guy. If this is just a ‚Äúpay Lucas to leave‚Äù it is a good deal. I‚Äôll sell my car, remortgage my condo, whatever. I‚Äôll make it happen.

But if it‚Äôs something darker?... I won‚Äôt forgive myself if I do not t stop it",3,1748978820.0,stories,1,0.8,False

I never received a phone call with instructions, which they promised to do, so I had to wing it. I stopped taking my propranolol for 24 hours, didn't eat or consume caffeine in the morning, and drank some water. I was having gnarly brain fog all morning.

They strap me in and ask me what my symptoms were, and I just can't keep up with their questions. I say ""I'm not sure how to explain it"" and ""It's complicated"" to pretty much every question because it feels like quantum mechanics exam when they ask about why I'm there. They set up an IV, keep horizontal for 10 minutes. While I'm laying flat, I feel like I'm having adrenaline surges and fluttering, and even have microseconds where I think I'm panicking but can't understand why. Those moments are fleeting. My fingers twitch a lot, which is common when I do any physical activity, drink coffee, or get stressed out.

They turn the table up to 70¬∞ for 45 minutes. I feel the blood pool in my legs, and notice I'm extremely tense through my whole body. I keep trying to relax, but my muscles tense back up after 5-10 seconds. Finger and arm twitching gets more intense. I don't know my heart rate or blood pressure this whole time. I feel like I'm getting sleepy, but not in the ""going to bed"" kinda way. More in the ""My brain is taking a break"" kinda way. I'm fully conscious, but getting more weak and even my internal monologue stops. After around 30 minutes (it takes a while) I finally get my legs to relax. And within a couple minutes, my entire body goes limp - knees buckle, vision partly cuts out, and I just can't use my muscles. The nurse scrambles to get me back up and asks if I'm okay. Weirdly I didn't lose consciousness at all, and I can talk to her the whole time. I just feel extremely weak. For the last 15 minutes, I'm more alert than I was before, maybe because I was a little more tense again.

They lay me back down and I get a big surge of ""Oh I'm awake and comfy!"" The blood flows back into the rest of me and I feel normal - even better than before the test somehow. Somehow I don't suspect my heart rate or blood pressure changed that much the whole time. I feel like my triggers are vast and complicated, but changes in laying/sitting/standing are only a minor trigger. I half suspect the test to be negative. I think mine was not a typical reaction, but it might not be reflected by my vital signs. The nurse seemed unsure. I'll hear the results in the next couple days.

My symptoms have been a lot worse before. Before stopping coffee and switching from glasses to contacts, it was 10x worse. I was genuinely struggling when I worked before, and this test was nothing compared to that. I also think there was still a little bit of propranolol in my body, and I wonder if it masked my symptoms. Either way, I feel okay right now. If it's not POTS, I have no clue why I'm having these symptoms. It feels like extreme adrenaline surges and panicking, but I'm mentally totally fine and not sure why I'd be panicking. That's especially true with the finger twitching episodes. If it's negative, I don't even know what to look into next. I'm hoping to get tested for Ehlers-Danlos and MCAS soon, if they'll consider it at all.",3,1748978800.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

I am a devotee of Santa Muerte, and I thought things were going great. I pray her novena every month (I dont ask for anything but protection for myself and family, and I just reflect on her mysteries, thanking her), I give her coffee in the morning, I give cigarettes, I take care of her altar, I spread her gospel to anyone who will hear. I approach her with so much love and intention to the best of my abilities. Im not perfect either, but everything I do for her is because I love her and I want to grow with her at my side.

Recently my 2 y/o Boerboel bit someone at a kennel he was at. We are now looking for professional behavioral training and a veterinary consultation to see if this could be a medical issue. The person he bit was talking about potentially suing us. Long story short, I begged her tearfully to protect us from being sued, any legal pursuits against us, and to help us keep him in our care. So far I havent heard anything about the person potentially suing, I have been waiting for updates but so far my father (the one who bought the dog and the dog is under his name on vet files) has said he hasn‚Äôt received updates. He was supposed to go to that kennel to find out.

After the first day of making my petition, I told her I could clean the cemetery by my house in her honor, bring her candles, prayed the rosary, brought her tequila, fresh roses, put a cigarette in ber statues mouth and smoked with her, I did everything i said I would. I proceeded to pray to her for 7 days asking for her intercession. I told her when this situation fully passed and we were in the clear of any legal pursuits, and that my dog would still be in the safety of our home, I offered her several different things when she came through for me. And I told her I would update her on what I knew of the situation and that I would absolutely not forget about her.

This morning, the third day of my monthly novena, my dog bit me. I dont think i need stitches, but I am typing this from the hospital.

I dont know what to do. I felt in my heart a sense of peace when i prayed to her. I thought everything would be okay. I will say i missed the second day of prayer, but i was just going to start over at the beginning and do the novena from the top today. I petitioned her green aspect (legal protection) and black aspect (to get rid of all obstacles). I just dont know if I disrespected her and this is the result.

Things have gotten so much worse, I thoight she would help me. Im not trying to be selfish and I do not see her as a genie. I only really every pray to her out of reverence, I try not to ask for much outside of protection. I only asked her for help because I was desperate. Maybe she doesnt want to help me.

I just want to keep my dog safe but the worst has happened. Please be kind and dont start prattling about how i need to put him down. Its not that fucking simple.",2,1748978762.0,SantaMuerte,1,1.0,False

I'm the creator of [e7rtastats.com](https://www.epic7rtastats.com/) - a site that collects and aggregates RTA data and presents in-depth stats for heroes, artifacts, sets, and builds used by high level players across the world. 2 weeks ago I released the [Meta](https://www.epic7rtastats.com/meta) page, and I would like to thank everyone for their amazing feedback. Today I would like to announce that I have brought back the [Draft Explorer](https://www.epic7rtastats.com/drafts) page.


&#x200B;

But before I go into the details, I have to mention that this page is locked behind an account signup. Creating an account is completely free, but you won't be able to access the Draft Explorer without being logged in. The reason for this is because I want to soft-launch the beginning of account tailored features for Epic7RTAStats. I have a lot of ideas in mind for new features that will be tailored around your account, the heroes you own, and the heroes you have built in order to help improve your climb in RTA. This will also allow me to better track what users are looking at and searching for, which will help me improve the site for everyone.

&#x200B;

[Draft Explorer page](https://imgur.com/a/60apt6k)

This page allows you to search for drafts that the site has processed for champion+ matches in the current season. You can filter by both first pick and second pick teams, and by pre-bans and picks for every position in the draft. In the above image example, I am looking for drafts where the first pick player bans Harsetti + Belian and first picks ML Luna, and the second pick player bans ML Arunka + Rinak and responds with ML Peira. 

&#x200B;

This search resulted in [136 matches, with the first pick player winning 62% of the time](https://imgur.com/a/0hv7xBD). The First Pick/Second Pick win/loss metrics at the top accounts for all drafts that the system has processed. Below that it shows the last 50 matches played, with details such as both players' rank, pre-bans, picks, artifact and set builds, and bans.

&#x200B;

I think this can be an extremely helpful tool for climbing RTA. You'll be able to do research on how well specific team comps perform as well as understand how the top players react and respond throughout the draft.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I have to mention that the search can be still quite slow. Depending on your filters it can take up to 30 seconds to respond, so please be patient. I'll look to optimizing the search in the next coming days once I get a feel on the general usage. If you experience any issues with the draft explorer or log in/sign up, or if you have any questions or feedback, please DM me on Reddit or add me on Discord (@zhaux). If you enjoy my site and would like to support me, you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/zhaux). Thanks!",9,1748978660.0,EpicSeven,0,1.0,False
1l2ks64,https://youtu.be/WmbvffKIiTY?si=iH4dgWE0kcsfiY5X,Pioneering Crypto Inventor Accuses SEC of Fabricating Evidence to Win Case,"Did the SEC play fair, or did it stack the deck to silence a blockchain pioneer?  
  
Reggie Middleton, founder of Veritaseum, filed a motion on May 30, 2025, accusing the SEC of fabricating evidence and intimidating witnesses to secure an asset freeze against him in 2019, which forced him into a settlement where he neither admitted or denied the allegations against him.   
  
Middleton alleges the SEC misrepresented a Kraken account as his personal account, despite it belonging to Veritaseum, LLC, to justify the freeze, denying him funds to mount a proper defense.   
  
The motion claims SEC attorney Jorge Tenreiro fabricated evidence and coerced witnesses to suppress testimony supporting Middleton.  
  
This case echoes the SEC v. DebtBox lawsuit, where the SEC was sanctioned $1.8 million in 2024 for similar misconduct involving fabricated evidence to issue a temporary restraining order.  
  
Middleton seeks to vacate the 2019 consent judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(d)(3), which allows relief for fraud on the court with no time limit.  
  
The outcome could impact regulatory accountability in the crypto space, spotlighting tensions between innovation and oversight.

   * In the process of starting my own firm and want to buy a good all around laptop that will last me years.

I have an Ultrawide Monitor at home I'd like to plug this into, hence the HDMI port ask. 
   * Most of the apps I use are web based now but I'd like to use Loom's desktop version. Mostly I will be using this computer for writing, creating newsletters/content on Canva, maybe doing some light photo editing for social media posts, and using web based financial planning tools that all work very well on my 2021 laptop so I don't suspect there will be any issues from a performance standpoint. 
   * My entire Google Drive synced to my desktop computer is 44GB - so I think 512 GB of storage space will be enough but open to recommendations.

      * Galaxy Tab 10 FE+ w/ keyboard: This is by far the coolest but the 8GB of RAM is making me pause. With current deals I can get this for about $750
      * Surface Laptop - No idea if more cores would be better, and with no HDMI/Display port I assume I am spending another $70-$100 to buy an adapter dock.
      * ASUS Vivobook vs Zenbook - is there a big difference between the Snapdragon and Intel processors?

1l2kpq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/crete/comments/1l2kpq8/driving_situation_in_crete/,Driving situation in Crete,"We came to Crete this week and rented an SUV. Firstly it was disappointing to not see any norma-sized SUVs and only european-sized ones for rental but anyway. 

On our first day we tried to go to the Starbucks in Chania for some lattes but the coastguard really didn't like that and threatened to fine us. Apparently some pedestrians got scared we were driving down to the old harbor and had called the police. I'll never understand the reason such a big road got labeled pedestrian only. In the end we had to leave without being able to get any coffee which was quite the frustration. 

That was the least of our worries for the day. We later went to Rethymno and went out for some shopping, only to get a very angry call from our rental company saying it's their first time in 10 years of operations they had one of their cars towed! I tried to explain that in America this happens all the time and not to worry. 

Apparently police said we were blocking the city's exit and no buses could pass which blocked all traffic... I didn't even know there was a bus to begin with. Like, ok, I guess the road was narrow but it's not my fault there was no sign to indicate no parking. 

As we were trying to handle the towing situation police officers had the nerve to comment on our clothing saying bikinis aren't appropriate for the city. I mean, I'm sorry you're a holiday country but I also didn't ask!

Aside of all that it's very frustrating how many roads in the cities are one way only. How are y'all used to driving like that? I got honked at so many times while driving. The roads should be widened for sure to make them all two way roads. 

Anyone else find the driving situation frustrating? How can we survive like this if there isn't even any Lyft available?",0,1748978494.0,crete,15,0.18,False

Backstory first i'm a M(34) trying to get back into dating, my last relationship was 12 years that turned into marriage, and then a divorce over Her leaving for another man. I met a girl on a dating app and we had great conversation, quickly moved over to texting through whats app and continued to have good convo there. One night staying up till 2:30 after chatting for 6 hours back and forth. We just met up Sunday after a week of taking for a late coffee date. Met her in the parking lot and gave her a container of homemade food that she asked me to bring to try out my cooking. She expressed she was not expecting me to follow through on that! I figured we would sit in the establishment but she wanted to just sit and chat in my car instead. We had a great over 2 hours of communication and getting to know each other, with a few good laughs included. She seemed to exhibit positive body language, holding eye contact, turning her body sideways to face mine, ect.¬†

After about an hour and 46 minutes she stated she needed to use the restroom, it was after 9 PM by now and I told her I believed the shop was closed but we walked up to the door together to verify. On the short walk back to the car we had another short laugh and she purposefully gave me a shoulder bump with her shoulder while walking. We got back to my car and she sat on the hood and I joined her and we continued to have good conversation. It was getting a tiny bit chilly so I got her a sweatshirt out of my car to wear, (which she still has). We continued the conversation outside sitting on the hood of my car where she playfully bumped by shoulder a few more times as we were laughing together. When we were finally preparing to part ways she expressed that she would love to see me again, and initiated a deep and long hug that honestly made the rest of my night.¬†

Through text the next day she thanked me for the food and let me know it was amazing and she would return the container next time we saw each other. I playfully bantered she was assuming she would see me again, which prompted her to reply ""sounds like you dont want"". I let her know I wouldn't have let her keep the sweatshirt if I didnt wanna see her again, to which she replied she would be happy to see me again. We are trying to plan a second date for Thu or Friday this week, she will let me know Wed which day works for her with how crazy her shift on the overnight can be.¬†

As good as the first date went i still cant shake a little bit of anxiety I feel. I feel like she is not as responsive to texts, and try to tell myself she is busy and on a weird sleep schedule with working the overnight shift, on top of English not being her native tongue. Maybe she is also just not the biggest texter? I was also hoping i could get an ironed out date today rather than waiting till tomorrow, even though I know she is busy. I may just be overthinking things, maybe its just anxiety and trauma/trust issues after what happened in my last relationship. During our convo she mentioned the dating app and said that she has ignored it because she doesn't wanna talk to more than one person at once. Am I just going crazy here and looking into things too deeply, it like i forgot how dating is supposed to look in the very beginning.¬†",0,1748978401.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

Like food, food is quite expensive. I have a job and I bring in money, I help out around the house, help out with the dogs, contribute to groceries, take my younger siblings places, the lot of it. I also pay my parents $400 a month (I work in an unfortunately underpaid industry right now, I currently only make about $1k/month) and my mom helps me pay for college (she pays upfront, I pay her back. It works for us) so I can start making more money. I‚Äôm currently looking at getting a certification at the end of this summer so hopefully by the end of this year I‚Äôll have either switched industries or have picked up some side hours with my new cert. I‚Äôm planning for the future and working on myself.

Now, maybe here‚Äôs where I may be a little entitled. I mean, I do recognize that I have a lot to be grateful for, and don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am grateful. However, I have 3 younger siblings. My brother is autistic and eats like he doesn‚Äôt know when he‚Äôs full. I wouldn‚Äôt be entirely surprised if he can‚Äôt feel when he‚Äôs full. My youngest sibling is 15 and also eats like a powerhouse. I get it, puberty and growing and all. It‚Äôs all good. That‚Äôs why I contribute to grocery funds: not only because I‚Äôm an adult and it‚Äôs only reasonable, but also because we could use some wiggle room when it comes to food. I‚Äôm cool with it. I do set aside a small fund for things that are mostly purchased with myself in mind. I‚Äôm up to sharing, *when asked.* what I don‚Äôt appreciate, is when my food simply disappears and I don‚Äôt get to know what happened to it. This has been an ongoing issue. I‚Äôll purchase something that needs to be stored in the fridge. Then, it will be there for a day or two because I can‚Äôt eat it all immediately or I buy enough for multiple meals/snacks or whatever. I typically establish what‚Äôs ‚Äúmine‚Äù (as in ‚Äúplease ask me before taking any of these items‚Äù) and what‚Äôs free grabs. Again, I don‚Äôt mind sharing *when asked* so I do always leave the option for everyone to ask if they see something they want to try that I bought. 

Today was my last straw. I had purchased a container of Ben and Jerry‚Äôs Phish Food flavor (a childhood classic for me!) and didn‚Äôt eat it all in one go. It had been there for about 3 days now, and today I get home after a shift having hoped to have some after lunch. I open the freezer: it‚Äôs gone. My mom had even purchased OTHER containers of Ben and Jerry‚Äôs and of Phish Food specifically because she noticed and was worried this would happen. She knows this is a sensitive issue of mine, as does everyone else. I used to live with an abusive roommate, and one of their ‚Äúgotcha!‚Äùs at me was stealing my food. I‚Äôve made sure everyone understands why this makes me so upset. And maybe it seems like I‚Äôm overreacting over ice cream. I‚Äôm willing to recognize that and see that it almost certainly looks silly. But it‚Äôs more about the disrespect of outright stealing my food even when I offer the option of sharing. It just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. I‚Äôm also not the only victim of this issue. My dad has his own fridge downstairs in the basement that he uses to avoid this issue that he dealt with years back. Occasionally, my mom‚Äôs food also goes missing. She then sends me to the store to replace it. I sometimes also try to replace my own goodies, even though I know they‚Äôre likely to be stolen again. It‚Äôs been an ongoing issue for a while now. 

Therefore, I see only one solution at this point: purchasing a mini fridge/freezer. I‚Äôve discussed this with my mom before. She‚Äôs worried about what it will contribute the already high electric bill. Honestly, I see her concerns and I understand. Money is difficult to come by, it doesn‚Äôt grow on trees exactly. But I also feel like there‚Äôs damn near no other way for me to feel safe and secure about my stuff. My other option is moving out, and I unfortunately just can‚Äôt afford that right now. I‚Äôm grateful for everything my parents do for me. I‚Äôm grateful they allow me to live in their house as an adult with such a low monthly contribution. I just can‚Äôt take my younger siblings disrespect of my things anymore. I fear I may be acting entitled or spoiled or something because I‚Äôm planning to go against my families wishes to solve a problem of my own instead of trying to work it out. But I feel like I also have tried to work this out. I dunno. I feel so conflicted about all this. Like I feel like a spoiled little brat for wanting to have my own pint of ice cream sometimes. But I feel like I‚Äôm being punished because I can no longer down a pint of Ben and Jerry‚Äôs in one sitting like I could in middle school. For now, one of the two pints I bought it still here, so now I‚Äôll be enjoying some of the coffee toffee bar crunch flavor. It‚Äôs good, but I was looking forward to the Phish Food today.

I‚Äôm also allegedly supposed to be getting a $2.65 raise on July 1, on top of that I just accepted a full time position. I‚Äôm willing to accept if my mom expects me to pay her more every month after this purchase. I will live with it. We‚Äôve been able to work things out this far so I‚Äôm hoping this can be worked out too. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd kick me out over something like this so I should be good",5,1748978241.0,Vent,4,1.0,False

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

1l2kkby,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1l2kkby/do_you_consider_small_lies_in_the_beginning_a_big/,Do you consider small lies in the beginning a big deal?,"Matched with this girl last Thursday. Her profile said ""New Here"". She was very responsive that night and through Friday to which she asked me if Id like to switch to text. We start texting and everything is going good. Shes telling me stuff like how handsome I am and that she is lucky I swiped on her. We follow each other on IG and have a short phone call. She let's me go as she has to get ready to go to work (bartender). She continues to text me while she's at work asking if I'll be up and if she can call me when she gets off. I tell her sounds good I should be up. The night goes on and it's radio silence. Ok, she was probably tired after work, Im not tripping. I figure I'll get a text Saturday. 

Saturday afternoon comes and I still haven't heard anything. I check Bumble and she had deleted her account. Not a huge deal, but kind of got the wheels in my head turning a bit considering we went from very consistent back and forth, her saying she'd call after work etc. to silence. I give it some more time until early evening and decide to send a text saying ""hey didn't hear from you, just wanted to make sure youre ok?"" She replies back stating ""sorry I suck on weekends, Im at work right now"". Im just like ok cool no worries glad youre good. 

Sunday comes and she texts me in the morning, we text a bit and then I call her. Before I called, I opened the Bumble app and she just happened to be the first person to pop up on my feed, with the same profile setup that we had originally matched on. On the call she mentions she deleted her account because she got ""over it"". I playfully ask how long until you make a new one to which she replied Im not, why would I make a new one? So thats small lie #1, again not really a big deal but seems a little bold considering the chances I could easily come across her on the app. We set up a time to meet later that night at a nearby coffee shop.

The date goes better than I could have expected. Great conversation and chemistry, we kissed for awhile at the end before she went  home, discussed next date etc. During the date I had asked her if she's ever taken the Amtrak anywhere (the station is walking distance from where we both live and I just recently rode it for the first time to go down to San Diego and watch a Padres game with my friend). She said no and mentioned that she has never been to Petco Park but heard it was a really nice stadium. 

Monday morning she texts me, we go back and forth throughout the day. She suddenly stops replying midday which seems odd given how consistent and well things seem to be going. Im looking at her Instagram and I happen to notice that her story highlights had been updated (not her actual story but one of the little customized story circle things above the main feed). There is a story from 2 days ago (Saturday) at Petco Park watching a Padres game (she had stated she was at work during this time). Crazy coincidence, but lie #2.

So basically, I can't believe anything this girl has said up to this point now because anything could be a lie. I haven't heard from her since she randomly stopped texting yesterday and my gut tells me I won't be hearing from her, unless I reach out again. It also seems somewhat clear to me that she is likely talking to multiple dudes even though her interest towards me does seem genuine enough. Im stuck between trying to reach out (and potentially be ignored) or just taking the L, preserving some pride and moving on. Ill probably go with the latter and just see if she reaches out again.

1l2kkbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForceRecruits/comments/1l2kkbu/is_my_dream_of_becoming_a_fighter_pilot_just_a/,Is my dream of becoming a fighter pilot just a pipe dream?,"This post will probably be a bit long winded, so apologies for that, and a sincere thanks to anyone who takes the time out of their day to even read this. 

When I was a kid, I had dreams of becoming a fighter pilot in the Air Force. I know, I know. You're thinking, ""you and everyone else pal."" I mean, what kid didn't at some point think about flying fighters. I carried that dream with me all the way through the middle of my college studies. Was told by a buddy of mine, who is a corporate pilot to try for a first class medical before I even spoke with a recruiter, and tried commissioning in as an officer. 

At the time I was going through some mental struggles in college. It was the middle of the pandemic, far away from family, and I was taking a high load of courses. I wasn't doing so hot. The breaking point was a minor incident of non-suicidal self-harm (which I regretted instantly, and still hold as my biggest mistake all these years later), and I decided I should probably talk to someone. I received a diagnosis of depression w/ a prescription for medication (Lexapro), which I didn't even end up trying until a year later (after getting the prescription renewed by a different specialist). I stopped taking the meds around 2 weeks later, as I was already feeling better. I tried them initially, as I figured I'd try them as an ""extra kicker"" to accelerate my feeling better. I eventually decided I truly didn't need them, so I quit. 

I have been off of them for nearing on five years now. Never had another incident. No recurring issues. I'm stronger than ever. I was a dumb kid back then who was way in over his head. I grew up sheltered, and wasn't ready for the harshness of reality. I'm a changed man now. I've matured, and gone through plenty of struggles (financial, familial, relationship, etc.) and been just fine. I've learned to love life for all of its ups and downs, and to welcome challenge as a chance to grow.

Needless to say I was immediately rejected a medical, and am now in the process of working with an AME to get cleared for a first class medical. My friend knew of my history, and I suppose at the time he didn't have the heart to tell me my chances were slim to none, and wanted to give me some hope that it was possible. I appreciate his care in keeping my dream alive, but maybe he should have just leveled with me then and there. Thinking of my dream now, I realize it's impossible. I mean, it's already HIGHLY doubtful I'll ever fly as a civilian pilot with a first class medical. What the hell am I thinking I'd ever stand a chance at becoming a fighter pilot?

Here's the thing though. For awhile I had given up completely on not only my dream of flying fighters, but flying in general. However, the flame of my dream never died out completely. If I can be permitted a cheesy metaphor, the flame survives as weak embers inside me still. With me, if my chances of success are 0.000001% that's enough for me. I still want to go for it. I want to fight for my dream with everything I have. I am willing to sacrifice years of my life, all of my money, and all of my resources to fight for even the slightest possibility of achieving my dream (hence why I'm spending the time and money it takes to jump through the FAA's hoops). I won't give up, even if it takes my entire life (I'm aware of 33 years old being the cut off, I just want to express the extent of my determination to get this done). For me, the regret of never even trying, despite the abysmal odds, is far worse than trying and failing. 

That being said, the logical part of me understands that this is probably the pipe dream to end all pipe dreams. I meet height and weight requirements. My vision is correctable to 20/20. No colorblindness. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Biology. I am currently 24 years old. The problem is my medical history. It's doubtful I'd ever be able to even join the Air Force, let alone become an aviator, LET ALONE fly fighters. It's already a near impossible feat to get a slot as a perfectly healthy individual with a spotless record and exceptional credentials. I figure a shmuck like myself, who'd be lucky to get into the force with a waiver at all, stands at exactly 0.00000001% success of ever seeing the inside of a fighter's cockpit. 

All of that taken into consideration, I am still willing to push on. If I could somehow make it, I would be able to die without regret knowing I tried everything I could. Even if I go through all of this and fail, I can die satisfied knowing that at least I tried. I just can't give up on my dream like that. I refuse to just roll over and give up on my dream without putting up a fight. I couldn't live with myself. As I sit here now, I know there is essentially a 100% chance that I will fail. Logically I know I won't make it. Logically I know I will be laughed out of the room the minute I talk with a recruiter. Yet, something in me still wants to try anyways. Maybe that makes me stupid. It probably does. Maybe I just won't wake up and smell the coffee. That's probably it. 

You're probably wondering at this point why I wasted my time even posting this despite knowing the requirements will get me ruled out instantly. I posted this to see if there were any other folks out there like myself, who have gone through the process, who could give me some advice on my situation. Even if you've heard of someone like me making it, that's enough for me. If your advice would be to give up on this dream, I completely understand. You'd probably be right in telling me to do so. However, if there is anyone else out there who has made it. If there is even the slightest of a percent of possibility I could achieve this dream, I'd also like to hear that too.

The idea that this could even be a possible feat excites me. If you believe I should give this idea up, and you feel like ""splashing some cold water in my face"" and ""waking me up"" to reality, I truly understand. I couldn't fault you for it. Thank you all for reading this. I'm honored you would take the time to hear me out. ",1,1748978144.0,AirForceRecruits,2,1.0,False
1l2kj0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1l2kj0n/is_the_pragmatic_view_of_theistic_belief_just/,"Is the pragmatic view of theistic belief just 'belief in God has practical benefits for me, so I am entitled to have it'?","Weirdly enough, pragmatic conceptions of ordinary beliefs, like that there is a cup of coffee on my desk, make more sense to me. That belief or idea clearly *does* something for me; it allows me to make all kinds of inferences about what I'm perceiving (that the desk will continue to hold up my cup, for example). Not sure if I explained that correctly, but I hope for those who are already familiar with pragmatism think I'm close to being right lol. 

In any case, there is still a pretty strong evidential factor involved in this pragmatic conception. Even independently of the pragmatic considerations, there's a lot of evidence that there's really a cup on my desk based on the reliability of sense experience. I guess for the existence of God, whether or not one can be entitled to belief in God based on pragmatic considerations will also depend on that particular agent's credences with respect to belief in God. Maybe the pragmatic consideration is only permissible when the agent has at least 0.5 credence in the proposition that God exists. Then they become further entitled to hold the pragmatic view if the belief holds genuine pragmatic value: it somehow enhances the *experience* of the agent, it somehow enhances the web of beliefs the agent already has, etc.

# Cakes Sizing Guide: Choose the Best Size in 2025

Choosing the right size cake for your event can be a daunting task.Overestimating leads to wasted cake, while underestimating leaves guests wanting more. This complete guide breaks down cake sizing to ensure you select the perfect cake for any occasion in 2025, from intimate gatherings to large celebrations. Accurate cake sizing contributes to a positive event experience and minimizes waste.By understanding key considerations,bakers and consumers alike can make informed decisions that optimize budget and enjoyment.

## Key features Analysis

**Cake Serving Chart:** This feature provides a detailed breakdown of cake sizes and their corresponding serving capacities.

A Standard cake serving chart outlines the number of servings that can be obtained from various cake sizes, typically measured in diameter for round cakes and in length/width for rectangular cakes. Accurate charts consider the standard serving size, which usually ranges from 1x2 inches to 2x2 inches, depending on cake type and regional preferences. The chart will detail how many people a 6-inch, 8-inch, 10-inch, 12-inch, and larger round or square cakes can comfortably serve. For shaped cakes,the serving number will have to be estimated according to volume.

**Cake Pan Dimensions:** Accurate cake pan dimensions ensure proper cake-to-frosting ratio.

precise measurements of cake pans are crucial for determining the final cake size and its consistency. the depth of the pan also impacts the cake's overall volume and baking time.Pans available range from shallow cake pans to deep loaf and bundt pans. Being conscious of each pan's dimensions is key.

**Tiered Cake Considerations:** Sizing tiered cakes for weddings or large events requires careful planning.

When planning a tiered cake, the serving capacity is cumulative, but the distribution across tiers must be strategically considered.the bottom tier typically supports the structural integrity and accounts for the largest serving portion. Each ascending tier reduces in diameter, providing visually attractive proportions and varying serving capabilities. Weight distribution and reinforcement are key for tiered cakes. Different filling and frosting options can dramatically alter the weight, particularly if using heavier buttercream, mousse, or ganache.

**Cake Thickness and Layers:** The thickness of the cake layers affects the richness and perceived serving size.

A Thicker cake slice appears more generous compared to a thinner one,influencing the perceived serving size. Opting for two or three layer cakes with fillings in between will significantly increase the overall height and apparent size. The type of batter used ‚Äì as a notable example, a dense pound cake versus light sponge cake ‚Äì also decides the serving richness and how many layers are necessary.

**Online Cake Sizing Calculators:** These digital tools simplify the sizing process.

Modern online calculators factor in the number of guests, cake type, and preferred slice sizes to suggest the most suitable cake dimensions. Advanced calculators might include fields of other desserts will be served, the type of event, dessert budget, and desired cake shape to refine the recommended cake size. Some even adapt to regional serving size conventions.

## Core Benefits

**Reduced Food Waste:** Accurately sizing your cake minimizes leftovers and waste.

By planning the appropriate cake size, consumers drastically reduce the amount of uneaten desserts after the event, contributing to eco-friendly principles and minimizing food costs. Reducing food waste becomes increasingly vital with the rising cost of ingredients. Smaller portions, based on accurate guest counts, can be just as enjoyable and prevent spoilage.

**Cost Optimization:** Choosing the right size can save money.

A smaller, adequately sized cake saves money compared to purchasing a large one with excessive portions. Professional bakers often charge by serving, so optimizing the final order based on confirmed guest numbers directly translates to cost savings. Homemade cakes can also benefit; buying the correct ingredients and baking time needed scales precisely to the chosen cake size.

**Enhanced Event Experience:** The perfect sized cake ensures all your guests can enjoy a slice.

Having enough cake for every guest promotes a positive event experience. Accurately planning the cake size removes stressful situations of running out of dessert which leaves certain attendees unsatisfied. A proportionally sized and decorated cake reflects the elegance of the event and the precision of the planning, resulting in a better overall atmosphere.

**Simplified Baking Process:** Precise sizing guides simplify baking and decorating.

Following accurate cake sizing guides ensures all components, from the batter to frosting, are proportional for the intended pan size. This greatly simplifies the baking process and prevents over or underestimations of recipe quantities, promoting confidence in achieving the perfect cake. Moreover, having a clear idea of the final size helps determine appropriate decoration complexities, conserving time and materials.

## FAQs Section

**How do I estimate the correct cake size if I'm unsure of the exact number of guests?**

When unsure of the actual guest count, overestimate slightly, adding 10-15% as a buffer. If other dessert options will be available,reduce the estimated serving amount per person by 20-30%. Communicating with guests ahead of time to get confirmation on their attendance can greatly refine this estimate.Caterers and event planners can provide historic data on expected arrival rates for events similar to that being planned.

**What is the standard serving size for wedding cake versus birthday cake?**

Wedding cake servings are generally smaller (approximately 1x2 inches) because it's often served after a large meal, while birthday cake servings tend to be slightly larger (2x2 inches), especially if cake is the primary dessert. Wedding cake is often served with other elements, such as dessert wines or coffees, so guests don't necessarily want a large portion. Birthday cake aims to be festive, and attendees sometimes indulge with larger slices to celebrate.

**Can I adjust the cake size depending on the age range of the party guests?**

Yes, if a significant portion of the guests are children, decrease the serving size estimations to account for their smaller appetites. Conversely,events primarily made up of adults,consider slightly increasing the portion size per person. Teens and young adults eat more than smaller children, so ensure that the cake caters to the average demographic.

**How does the cake's shape affect the number of servings?**

While cake serving charts primarily reference round and square cakes, irregular shapes require visual estimation. Always base serving size by equivalent volume. A heart shaped cake will require carving, often resulting in lost cake, so one must estimate a higher base cake size. Unusual shapes need precise volume estimates for accurate sizing.

Putting myself out there a bit. I'm a 37-year-old guy living in London. Life's pretty good, but it's always nice to meet new people, right?

A few things I enjoy:

* **Swimming:** You'll often find me doing laps at the local pool ‚Äì it's my go-to for clearing my head and staying active. Always happy to chat about good spots or even find a swimming buddy.
* **Photography:** I love capturing moments and a bit of the world around me. You can get a feel for my style over on my Flickr:[https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/)
* **Reading:** I'm a big fan of history, and I'm currently making my way through ""Revolutionary Spring"" by Christopher Clark. It's a fascinating look at 1848 in Europe. Always up for book recommendations or a good discussion.

Beyond that, I enjoy exploring London's never-ending offerings, decent coffee, and good conversation.

Looking to connect with friendly, interesting people for chats, maybe a coffee or a walk, and see where things go. Whether you share some of these interests or have completely different ones you're passionate about, I'm open to hearing from you.

Putting myself out there a bit. I'm a 37-year-old guy living in London. Life's pretty good, but it's always nice to meet new people, right?

A few things I enjoy:

* **Swimming:** You'll often find me doing laps at the local pool ‚Äì it's my go-to for clearing my head and staying active. Always happy to chat about good spots or even find a swimming buddy.
* **Photography:** I love capturing moments and a bit of the world around me. You can get a feel for my style over on my Flickr:[https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/)
* **Reading:** I'm a big fan of history, and I'm currently making my way through ""Revolutionary Spring"" by Christopher Clark. It's a fascinating look at 1848 in Europe. Always up for book recommendations or a good discussion.

1l2k29c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l2k29c,Mixed berry cider (maybe),"Is it even a cider if it contains no apples at all? Either way I made it and I'm posting it here. 

My local supermarket was selling 1kg bags of frozen mixed berries super cheap so I decided to buy a bunch and ferment them. 

I started with 5kg mixed berries (strawberry, redcurrant, blackberry and blackcurrant). I washed and put the fruit into a container and gave them a coating of sugar. I then let them defrost and once at room temperature I addrd pectic enzyme to help with juice production. Then I transferred into a brewbag inside of a carboy. The juice level was still a bit too low so I added 1l blueberry juice and 1l cranberry/raspberry juice (both store bought from concentrate) 

I added fermaid-o, DAP and bentonite. I also added a little more pectic enzyme to account for the added juice. I then pitched 5g of lalvin 71b. 

Spent a week in primary and a month in secondary. Backsweetened and bottled today. 

To back-sweeten I made a syrup using 350g fresh raspberries, 350g fresh blueberries and 500g fresh strawberries (couldn't get any frozen). Wash and chopped and then put into a ziplock bag and put it in the freezer for 48 hours. Then i defrosted them in a jug and once at room temp i added pectic enzyme and left over night.

I figured waking up, making a cup of coffee, squeezing in 10 minutes of meditation, and a quick workout would be a game-changer for my focus and stress levels throughout the day. But, man, getting up early and actually doing it every single morning is like pulling teeth for me.

I totally underestimated how attached I was to my old morning habits‚Äîwaking up just in time, scrolling through my phone aimlessly, and chugging a quick coffee before rushing out the door. These were just autopilot actions, and breaking away from them felt like fighting my own instincts. I guess it's all about how these routines were so engrained in my daily life that anything disrupting them felt... off.

The first few days weren't too bad, but as the novelty wore off, I found myself slipping back into my old habits. It's like my brain kept telling me, ""Just snooze the alarm one more time, you deserve it,"" even while the rational part knew sticking to the routine would make me feel better long-term.

One thing that's helping, though, is reminding myself why I started. The few days I actually followed through, I noticed a big difference in my mood and productivity. It‚Äôs crazy how just those tiny changes can set a positive tone for the entire day. A friend suggested keeping a journal about how I feel those rare mornings when I do everything right, to keep me motivated when I'm tempted to skip it.

I guess the whole struggle boils down to recognizing that those little habits are really *big* habits, and shifting them takes persistence. But I'm optimistic. Anyone else struggling with finding consistency in new habits, or have any tips? ü§î",1,1748976650.0,habitDecoded,0,1.0,False
1l2k1qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1l2k1qu/confused_about_symptoms_after_finishing_triple/,Confused about symptoms after finishing triple therapy,"Hey everyone,

Bit of context: I was diagnosed after half a year of continous productive coughing, globus sensation and gastrointestinal issues.

I did triple therapy, however after stopping PPIs a week ago I have very mixed feelings.
My regular diet, antacids don't seem to do it anymore.


First of all, after stopping with PPIs my continuous back pain and stomach ache was gone almost immediately. I finally no longer suffer at work etc. Tried coffee, this time I actually wasn't choking from it. Chest pain is still present, also was during the ppis mostly. Sometimes gone after getting out of bed.

On the other hand, my globus sensation is much worse, and I feel like it doesn't only come up with certain foods. I started feeling like I need to throw up, and as if something was really stuck on my throat. It only happens a few times throughout the day, but it does last 1-2 hours usually. Throat is also extremely red, and looking inflamed. I also cough large amounts of mucus, it has gotten worse especially in the mornings. Chest pain is still present, also was while taking ppis mostly. Sometimes gone after getting out of bed.

Called with my gp, says its normal and I should just wait 4 weeks to get retested. I might also get an appointment with an ENT. I was wondering if anyone had similar experiences?
Perhaps someone has ideas of how I could deal with this?

**AMIR**  
Not just any toaster. *This* baby‚Äôs from 1987. The year toast peaked.

**JAKE**  
How do you even determine something like that?

**AMIR**

**JAKE**  
You did not just say that.

**AMIR**  
I have a dream, Jake. And that dream is to make toast... and then sell it back to the company at a *reasonable* markup.

**JAKE**  
You‚Äôre trying to *resell* toast... to our office?

**AMIR**  
Yes. For morale. For synergy. For capitalism, baby!

I see some discussions here about difficulty finding connections that matter, so maybe some people can relate to this?

As a group that already struggles to make friends, let alone true and understanding friends, I was wondering how anyone ever continues seeking out friendships or do with the ones that used to matter. I have had one good friend that I made in the past full decade. Unfortunately, honest conversations and hangouts have become somewhat superficial. It's okay to go moments without speaking or talk about anything funny or lighthearted, but when we often we hang out, I'm sitting there at the coffee shop staring out the window or looking at people from a park bench while they scroll through their phone. I don't want to see the funny videos or memes that they found on their app; I don't want to talk about some celebrity relationship; I don't want to hear about some new club they went to. I laugh along and listen intently because I care about this person and want to hear them out, but I hardly get the same sort of feedback. I'm starting to feel like a piece of decor they keep for conversation, there to shine a light upon whatever is it they're looking at. Why invite a friend out when you don't look them in the eye half the time?

I guess the feeling I'm getting at is that of 'misunderstood.' It often feels like people do not value the effort or time we put in or make in our day to understand, speak with, and get to know them. It's because of this that maybe we're unable to connect with others as much as we would like. Personally, I don't mind meeting and making small talk with a stranger in public, for example; that's not the issue. It's the fact the people whom I allow to know me best, well, probably don't really know me or don't want to get to know me as much as I've made the effort to understand them. It's isolating, and the future seems like more and more likely to be an intense version of this life.

After going through chemo , I  caught some nasty cough which wasn't going away for 15+ days and kept on getting worse. so finally doctors wrote me a month long prednisolone taper along with other medicines and that finally got it controlled.   


But now I found another issue : My blood sugar levels are 160 and 426! I am freaking the shit out.   

Diabetes run in my father's family, but I was not ready for this. I don't even like sweets that much, i am a cheese guy.  on Sunday I had my monthly tumor marker and other checks and the lab guy just suggested adding a fasting sugar test to make the whole package cheaper. so i did and it showed 160. I was not worried coz meh, who cares.   


But today i was in office and there was a random health checkup session going on. I don't join these usually, but i had some free time after lunch and I just had a cold coffee (strong, with sugar)  10 mins ago. Friends pushed me to take it, but mann ibwas shocked . She said 426 sugar!   


I don't even want to tell my parents as they would unnecessarily freak out and panick over our usual meals.   my upcoming meals  fro today would probably be :  

- some evening snack  with tea (homemad potato fries with salt or maybe steam corn)   

- dinner consisting of chapatti , some saute vegetables curry and probably some daal(lentil soup) .

We all know that it‚Äôs only a matter of time before our boilers start to swivel on its base‚Ä¶. And although it doesn‚Äôt impact the quality of the shots, it sure is annoying.  So, with a permanent fix in mind, I proceeded to secure the boiler to the base.

Of course, while I was dismantling my PV, what a great opportunity to install the brilliant Coffee Sensor B-Push steam valve. A super easy installation, especially when you have access to the bottom of the boiler. This item is a real game changer‚Ä¶. Highly recommended!

The process is pretty simple.

Using your brass collar, locate the position for the three 5mm holes you'll need to secure three 5mm brass studs.  The studs should be long enough to secure the heating element, but not foul the plastic base cover.

Drill/tap (4.2mm drill / M5x.8mm tap) the boiler (carefully).  Install the three brass studs and braze to ensure tight seal.

Drill the three matching holes in the base.

Assemble with suitable fasteners.

Bring the unit to a boil and rinse twice to remove any flux and brazing resin.

The boiler will NEVER swivel again!

First I need to give you the whole story.
Me and my boyfriend got together in april 2023. Last summer (2024) I started to feel that he‚Äôs losing feelings and pulling away from me. When I brought it up he dismissed me saying that I‚Äôm just overthinking. 
In September he went on a trip. When he was there I felt like he doesn‚Äôt miss me at all. On this trip he started to have feelings for his girl friend ( he told me months later).
When he came back from this trip he got drunk and told me that he feels I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe one‚Äù in his head but not in his heart. What I should‚Äôve done was standing up and saying ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt appreciate me than you won‚Äôt have me‚Äù. What I did instead was think loving him harder will change his mind. 
There were more thing that happened with this other girl, but he never physically cheated on me. But he fully cheated on me emotionally and betrayed me. 
Fast forward in November we broke up. I spent a month crying. And he spent his time talking to that other girl. 
I wrote him a two page letter every single day because I really loved him that much even after he caused me so much pain. Before Christmas I met him at the gym and gave him the letters. He didn‚Äôt read them for a while.
When he finally read them he called me crying. I don‚Äôt remember what happened specifically but we spent New Year‚Äôs Eve together and a week later we got back together. 
It was beautiful for about two months. In March I had to go away for 3 weeks. He didn‚Äôt miss me at all. We barely talked and when we did it usually ended in a fight. The last Friday before I came back, he went to a party. We both knew that the ‚Äúgirl he left me for‚Äù was gonna be there. I told him that I don‚Äôt like it because I‚Äôm scared that something might happen. He went anyways. 
At this party the girl I‚Äôll call her K. K told him that she doesn‚Äôt want to mess with his head but she regrets how she basically ghosted him. After that they danced together and almost kissed and he confessed that he gave her a forehead kiss. Which in my opinion is even worse than a normal kiss. 
When I got back and he told me everything that had happened we obviously broke up.
This happened over a month ago. I was even more heartbroken than the first time. Because when it happened for the first time I still had hope that our story isn‚Äôt finished and our paths will cross again. But this time I had no hope. I knew it was the end. So I listened to every single podcast on Spotify about letting go, breakups and heartbreak.
It was vey difficult because I don‚Äôt have any friends. Like I mean not a single one. So I had no one to talk to. Somehow I managed and I started to feel better even just by myself. I started to enjoy my own company. And I was convinced that he wants nothing to do with me.
One Saturday morning I was cooking as usual and I got a message, which was weird because I don‚Äôt get messages for anyone. It was him. He wrote ‚Äú I know you probably don‚Äôt want to see me but I‚Äôll ask anyways. Would you want to grab a coffee sometimes?‚Äù I was shocked. 
Now I have to explain what I feel for this boy. I‚Äôm the type of person who doesn‚Äôt want to date around. I want someone who I can love and who will love me forever through anything and everything. I want someone who I‚Äôll marry one day and who I can grow old with. And this is what I felt for him. I wanted that with him. That future. But he didn‚Äôt. Which is the heartbreaking part that makes me question myself. When he was everything I ever wanted in a partner and I wasn‚Äôt enough for him than something surely must me wrong with me. No?
My feelings towards him will never change. I will love him forever. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I want to get back with him(I think), because I can‚Äôt overlook what he had done to me and how terrible he made me feel so many times. 
We did go to a caf√® and it felt weird in the beginning cause we haven‚Äôt spoken in almost two months. But after a while it started to feel, you know familiar. 
I wish it wasn‚Äôt like this because I genuinely love him with my entire heart and I miss him and think about him constantly. I know we can‚Äôt be together but I‚Äôd do anything to change that fact. This man is really something else. But he hurt me so bad. And I still love him. Nobody will ever understand what I feel for him. I know I sound like a dumb little girl in love, but when I love I never ever ever stop. 
So I need your thoughts. Is it a bad idea to go out with him again. Am I too dumb? Am I not seeing something? What should I do? Cause I think he finally realized what I have to offer and he himself said that he doesn‚Äôt miss the physical stuff or being in a relationship but he misses me. I want to believe him, but I feel like it‚Äôs all just lies to make me want him or something. God knows he has done that so many times. Telling me sweet things like I don‚Äôt already know the truth. But when he said that he misses me specifically he said it on an example and it kinda didn‚Äôt feel like a lie.But I‚Äôm still scared to  trust him. Do you think I should just tell him to go and I shouldn‚Äôt waste another second on him?  Or should I see what happens and how this develops? I‚Äôm torn between let them lose you and don‚Äôt give up on something you can‚Äôt go a day without thinking of. 
What do you think cause I‚Äôm so lost. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this post is messy and I didn‚Äôt write everything cause there‚Äôs so much. But this is the base that you need to know.

We had been dating for 2 months when the pandemic began & he moved in, keeping his condo but living full-time with me. We married 2 months ago & are in the process of selling his condo.

Situation One: (just surfaced) When H moved in he was WFH & I was not working so I made him three meals a day, nothing elaborate but decent & with a fair amount of variety. I had a busy career for many years so until the pandemic daily cooking was not the focus of my day. Usually it was a dreaded chore. During the pandemic I treated it as a new hobby & even enjoyed it a bit. I also cooked dinner 4x a week for my ex who was also my neighbor. Ex was in fragile health so meal prep was a form of caretaking. After his death I enjoyed cooking less. I started using premade meals more (healthyish from high end vendors, Good Eggs, Locale) Then H retired. We went from 3 meals a day to 2. I continued to make sure H got his favorite foods several times a week. H has never cooked for me. Even bringing me coffee is a rare occurance. I do 100% of the planning, shopping, & cooking & 90% of the clean up. Last week, off & on,  H was moody & a bit distant. On Saturday he admitted he was out of sorts and said the reason was because earlier in the week I mentioned that cooking made me sad after my ex‚Äôs death because cooking for Ex had been the one thing I could do for him. H went on to say he was tired of precooked meals & was upset that I cooked for Ex but not him. (Reminder: prior to my Ex‚Äôs death I made 4 meals a week for Ex & 15 for H. I still make 10-15  meals for H each week) He complained vociferously about some menu items and my preferences.  He said he wasn't comfortable in the kitchen because it is not his kitchen. Seeking clarification I  asked,  ‚ÄúAre you angry I do not cook?‚Äù He answered affirmatively. My first response was to defend myself. My second was to begin menu planning & then I remembered it is not 1955 & H is not an invalid (altho he has back pain) or a toddler. I told H I would no longer be cooking for him. He is responsible for everything he eats & I am responsible for what I eat. I have not changed my mind. He has not apologized. Today he said, ‚ÄúI would like to have some home cooked meals.‚Äù it isn't going to happen. AITA?

Situation 2: Prior to 2020 H had lived in the same home for 33 years. It was packed to the rafters with everything a midcentury divorced, reasonably affluent man could have wished for, 1000+ movies, 3 large closets full of clothes & shoes, electronics (2 of everything & latest versions of most things) luxury items, pictures, tools, collectables, massive amounts of supplies from Costco & junk. There was so much stuff he often couldn't find what he was looking for. When we agreed to combine households I began sorting thru his things. Except for the bathroom & kitchen cabinets I held every item up for him to decide what to keep, give away or toss. I lifted, packed, donated, & unpacked everything myself because of his back. I even endured the hellscape of FB Marketplace to sell or try to sell 8-10 pieces of used furniture. (he listed & sold two collectable items) When assistance was needed I found it. To make room for his stuff I gave away or sold many of my things. I turned my living room into our media room & designed an office space for  his computers & collectables. It looks great! Everything in the garage is his, neatly organized & accessible. His 1000+ movies are alphabetized & 79 years of pictures & memorabilia are organized in boxes by decade. 1/2 of the bedroom is his, redesigned to suit his taste & needs. He has enjoyed having friends over to show them his new home.  He enjoys using all of the new spaces.But he tells me several times a week how hard it was to leave his place, even tho he has lived with me for 51/2 years. At least once a week he complains that some possession disappeared without his knowledge. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èToday I spent 8 hours helping him with his condo sale without a single ‚Äúthank you‚Äù.

I found the realtor, made  decorating decisions,  created punchlists & am doing walk thrus so he (we) can reap profits. But the ratio of his complaints to gratitude is approximately 10:1.

# üò¨ Introduction ...

If your mouth feels gross, *everything* feels gross. I‚Äôm talking dry tongue, sore gums, and breath that could clear a yoga class. It hits your confidence, and even your social energy.

Brushing harder doesn‚Äôt fix it. What most people miss is the simple fact that the good bacteria in your mouth might‚Äôve been wiped out by your well-meaning toothpaste or daily rinse.

So, some clever bods created [ProDentim](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) \- an oral probiotic that doesn‚Äôt just freshen breath; it supports your **oral microbiome** where it matters most. I did the research and tested it. Here's everything you need to know.

As it happens, we [reviewed ProDentim](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeReviewedIt/comments/1dteey8/prodentim_review_2024_unlock_the_secret_to_a/) about a year ago and also recently compared it to another popular product in our [Powerbite vs ProDentim](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeReviewedIt/comments/1ksyezd/we_tested_powerbite_vs_prodentim_only_1_helped/) showdown. (Spoiler : *PowerBite won out for enamel repair)*

This time, my friend Caleb takes the reins ...

# üì¶ Product Overview

**Product Name**: ProDentim  
**Category**: Health & Wellness ‚ûù Oral Health Supplements  
**Overall Verdict**: 4.8/5

# üîç What Is ProDentim?

**ProDentim** is a chewable supplement with **3.5 billion CFU** of beneficial bacteria. It helps feed the good microbes that live in your mouth and keeps the bad ones in check.

Each tablet includes **inulin**, **malic acid**, and **tricalcium phosphate**, all ingredients popular in **supplements that support oral hygiene** and healthier gums.

It's not some chalky tablet either. These are easy to chew, slightly minty, and designed for people who want a *simple* way to support their **oral health**.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How Does ProDentim Work?

ProDentim works by helping you **restore healthy bacteria in your mouth** after years of mouthwash or sugary coffee stripped it clean.

By using **chewable probiotic supplements for oral care**, it helps deliver strains like *Lactobacillus Paracasei* and *B.lactis BL-04¬Æ* right to the gums and teeth.

Using these live strains with other **probiotics you can chew for dental support**, improves the environment inside your mouth and reduces dryness, odor, and irritation.

It's a **natural solution for oral health**, giving your mouth [the nutrients it needs](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) without blasting it with chemicals.

# üß™ Benefits: What Can You Expect?

With consistent use, I noticed a big shift in how my mouth felt. The **results from using my ProDentim supplement** became more obvious by week two.

Gum sensitivity faded, and my breath? Crisp. Not ‚Äúminty cover-up‚Äù fresh‚Äîjust **healthier bacteria levels** making everything feel... clean.

These **natural methods to heal your gums**, seem to work particularly well if you‚Äôre someone who drinks coffee, eats sugar, or uses harsh oral care products often.

Many users say it‚Äôs among the **best probiotics for adult dental health**, especially if you're done relying on quick-fix breath sprays or abrasive pastes.

# ‚úÖ Is ProDentim Safe?

Yes, it‚Äôs safe for most people. The formula uses clean, **non-GMO**, gluten-free ingredients and doesn‚Äôt contain stimulants or harsh chemicals.

I did experience some bloating on day two‚Äîvery common with **probiotics that help with gum disease** or gut support‚Äîbut it passed quickly.

This supplement may help **correct an oral bacteria imbalance** gently and effectively, without drying out your mouth like alcohol-based rinses can.

# üßë‚Äçü¶± My Personal Experience (Told by a Friend)

One of my running buddies, **Caleb**, is a 42-year-old cycling coach who‚Äôs super dialed into his health‚Äîbut not so much his dental routine.

We met through a local wellness group, and over the years, he's become my go-to source for all things anti-inflammatory and electrolyte-related.

But let‚Äôs just say oral care was never at the top of his ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù list.

He told me he [started trying ProDentim](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) after noticing his breath wasn‚Äôt exactly trail-friendly during early-morning rides.

Plus, he was getting annoyed with how his gums felt sensitive after long sessions of energy gels and sugary hydration mixes.

His dentist mentioned **probiotics that reduce mouth inflammation**, so he decided to test the supplement for a couple of months.

Caleb said within about two weeks, his mouth just felt ‚Äúcleaner,‚Äù and the weird metallic taste he‚Äôd sometimes get after a tough ride was gone.

He also noticed **less gum irritation** around that back molar where his bite guard rubs.

His breath was fresher too‚Äîsomething his fianc√©e confirmed, which I think he appreciated even more than the dental perks.

The only minor drawback? He found the chewables a bit sweet at first, probably because he‚Äôs not a fan of stevia. But he got used to it after a few days and stuck with the routine like he does his protein shakes.

So yeah, Caleb‚Äôs verdict? ‚ÄúThis stuff's legit‚Äîespecially for athletes who push their bodies but forget about their mouths.‚Äù

# üí≠ Gut vs. Mouth Probiotics

A lot of folks wonder about **comparing gut probiotics to oral probiotics**. They‚Äôre very different.

Gut probiotics focus on digestion and immunity, while oral strains are meant to live on your gums, tongue, and teeth. One doesn‚Äôt replace the other.

So if your goal is **helping** [restore good bacteria](https://theworldhealth.org/prodentim-101-text-official) **in your mouth**, you need the specific strains ProDentim offers.

# üëç Pros

üü¢ **Supports gum health** with high-quality, targeted bacteria  
üü¢ Helps **increase good bacteria in your mouth** naturally  
üü¢ Easy-to-use **chewable probiotics for mouth health**  
üü¢ Includes **ingredients that promote healthier teeth and gums**

# üëé Cons

üî¥ A little bloating at the beginning for sensitive guts  
üî¥ Taste might be too sweet for some  
üî¥ Needs consistency‚Äîdon‚Äôt expect miracles in 48 hours

# üßæ Conclusion

These **probiotics help with breath and teeth**, useing clean ingredients and they don‚Äôt rely on chemicals to force short-term freshness.

If you're someone who values **supplements for healthy teeth and gums** and wants something that works with your body, not against it‚Äîthis is worth a try.

# ‚ùì FAQ

Some people notice **improved oral flora** in a week. For full results, allow 30‚Äì60 days.

We align on future goals, morals, values, respect for each other etc.

The one thing we‚Äôve run into a weird position on is how money is spent on dates and who should pay for what. Since we‚Äôve started dating, I will pay for 99% of our dates whether we are just grabbing coffee, a couple drinks or a full dinner. I will also go out of my way to grocery shop and cook for us together at least 6 days a week for any meal we can spend the time together for. Recently, after dates, she will mention ‚Äúoh I could‚Äôve split that with you!‚Äù Or ‚Äúoh, I was going to pay for that‚Äù ‚Ä¶ but only after I have already had my card charged or at some point later in the day when it isn‚Äôt really relevant anymore. 
We‚Äôve had a couple discussions stemming from that where I told her if that‚Äôs really the case, it would be nice for her to offer to do so BEFORE I pay, otherwise I‚Äôm just going to assume I‚Äôm covering it and I then pay the bill in full, it‚Äôs not going to be something I ask her to do at the table or ask for money from her later on.


I don‚Äôt mind paying for things I plan or taking her out to make it special for her. I enjoy it. In fact I just spent $600+ for a birthday weekend for her after organizing the entire thing with all of her friends, planning an entire bar menu and appetizers that made and served myself for the entire night. I loved it. However, we‚Äôve talked about how i can really only afford to pay for two people‚Äôs worth more than a few times a month and how if we want to go out more than that, it would be really nice to be able to split things so we can experience more without hurting myself financially.

She has since taken an extreme stance on this, making it out like I‚Äôm cheap and don‚Äôt want to treat her or pay for anything for her. We have had multiple conversations about how frugal she is and how I am not like this and so I feel like this is coming from a place of ‚ÄúI make my money, I spend your money‚Äù and this doesn‚Äôt rub me the right way. 

My question to you all, is it normal to be in a relationship where both parties work well paying jobs and to still be expected to pay for everything while they save their money to spend on trips or whatever else they‚Äôd like for themselves? This is not an agreement where we live together or have plans on marriage so there is no joint savings or understanding that the money she is saving will ever be used together.

1l2jktp,https://www.reddit.com/r/bologna/comments/1l2jktp/any_recommendations_on_an_itinerary/,Any recommendations on an itinerary?,"Hi all, 

Heading to Italy for the first time and we're staying in Bologna from June 14 to June 16 so I wanted to see if y'all had any critique on the plans, any recommendations on things I might have missed, or must see?

  
June 14. We fly into Milan and will take the train to Bologna Centrale (hopefully getting in around 4pm). We're staying near the train station (5-10 minutes away). 

We might visit Parco della Montagnola just to visit (and the potential weekend market). From there, we have dinner reservations at¬†**Da Cesari's**¬†at 8:00 pm, so my plan is to wander down Via Indipendenza at the shops, maybe head to the Mortadella Shop. Someone reported that Via Indipendenza is closed due to the new tram tracks, so the plan is to lateral to a side street down if it's too impacted. 

After dinner, we plan to do¬†**Cremeria Santo Stefano**¬†(and¬†**Gelateria Cremeria Mascarella**¬†as a back-up if we don't want to head that far from the town).

If not too tired from traveling, maybe head to the bar district? Unfortunately the jazz club that we intended to go to will close for the season (Camera Jazz Club), so I was wondering if¬†**Cantina Bentivoglio**¬†is fun to go to, even if our plan is to drink. From the reservations, it seems like the reservations are for dinner, but some reviews mention that you can just drink (with a cover charge).

**Breaking Toast**¬†in case we get hungry around midnight.

**June 15:**¬†No real plans in the morning except to wander (maybe¬†**Terzi Cafe**¬†for coffee). Plan is to head to Piazza Maggiore/Basilica of San Petronio/Fountain of Neptune. We do want to go to¬†**Mo Mortadella Lab**¬†for lunch.

Aside from this, the afternoon is clear. We'd likely wander around the Mercato del Elbre or Mercato di Mezzo, and plan to visit either¬†**Camera a Sud**¬†or¬†**Le Stanze**¬†for apertivo, but may just stumble upon whatever seems to call us.

Maybe, go to La Piccola Venezia, the Quadrilatero District, Mercato de Mezzo or Mercato del Ebre.

We have dinner at Il Passatello. One of the prior gelato places for gelato, and then could use some recommendations for a fun Sunday night thing.

**June 16:**¬†Maybe go to Archiginnasio of Bologna and wander around. WE have lunch at 12:00 at¬†**The Gallery Piazzart Food & Drink.**¬†From there, we plan to visit the Two Towers (sadly seems closed for climbing), and then we have an open day until 8:00 dinner at¬†**Al Sangiovese.**

Could use some recommendations on things to do / eat / visit. Current plan is for: Aurum, Biblioteca Salaborsa, Madonna di San Luca. We might try and find some souvenir shops. 

Late night: Nu Lounge Bar

Gelato: Cremeria Supernatural.

But we‚Äôre not folding. This is just a pause‚Äînot a stop. We‚Äôre actively working on securing a better, safer, and more reliable location that respects our community and allows us to keep doing what we love.

In the meantime, we‚Äôre setting our sights on a makeup event at Thunder Valley‚Äîsomething fast, loud, and worth the wait. Details coming soon.

And for those wondering why the Street Rod Nationals haven‚Äôt returned to Oklahoma‚Äîwell, after this month‚Äôs challenges, we think we‚Äôve got a pretty good idea why.

Thanks for always showing up. This community isn‚Äôt just alive‚Äîit‚Äôs firing on all cylinders.

1l2jiyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1l2jiyg/i_built_a_tool_that_helped_me_get_the_biggest/,I built a tool that helped me get the biggest raise of my career,"Last year I walked into my performance review feeling proud and walked out with a raise that barely covered coffee. When my manager asked for concrete wins my mind just went blank, so the conversation fell flat. Before the meeting, I really struggled to remember the things I accomplished. I could point at a thing or two, that were ""big"", but nothing big enough to give me the raise I thought I deserved

That night, I started building [Winlog](https://winlog.ai?ref=reddit). A tool that let me write about my achievements, or make a voice recording, or copy my tasks into it for it to generate a nice, engaging summary and save to my profile.  
I also added integrations specific to my industry to allow me pull in my work and auto sync my achievements without typing it all out all the time

This year, I created a timeline report of the big wins I had in the last year, and sent to my manager ahead of our performance review and I got my biggest raise since I started working there

Not only that, my manager signed up to use WinLog too, and after a month, most of my colleagues and friends are using it, and referring it.

Now, I'm opening it up for more people to use and I want to understand how to tailor it to other industries where its relevant.

I'd love to know how to improve this tool. Please, take a look at [https://winlog.ai](https://winlog.ai) and let me know what you think!

Thank you

1l2jh66,https://i.redd.it/v61yf7819r4f1.jpeg,Metatarsalgia vs Mortons neuroma,"Hello.  63 yo male.  Began suffering foot pain 1 yr ago, 90 days after retiring and moving to NC.  Lots of hills, hiking, etc preceded my condition upon relocation.  Foot size went from 10.5 to 11 5.  Pic shows location of pain.  Diagnosed by podiatrist after x-ray with metatarsalgia, told me to get NB, Topo, or Brooks shoes with heavy support inserts, plus 2 stacked metatarsal pads on right foot.  

Lack of improvement led to a pred pack plus celebrex.  Made foot things better, but then other stuff worse, as my gut blew up.  Stopped the celebrex and pred, and now taking 2 doses of fomitidine a day.  Stomach is mostly better, as long as I don't drink coffee and limit alcohol (wine infrequently, no bourbon or beer).  

Foot pain is manageable with no long walks, no running/jumping, and ice on foot bottom  after outdoor chores or hiking, followed by foot rest.  

Not pleased with condition and limitations, but maybe that's life.  My question to the group is, does my diagnosis fit the symptoms?  Never had a ultrasound or mri, nor did I get a prescribed a specific orthotic.  Never a mention that it could be mortons neuroma, which might suggest different treatments.  

Advice, experience sharing most appreciated.

**The Before**

I was extremely hypersexual, often five times a day, actual hours wasted at 3am because my sleeping schedule was also horrible. Coffee, resentment, watched blood-filled action shows and really whatever I want. I was bad-mouthed, a pervert, everything bad under the sun came out of my being.

**What I'm Like Now**

Not much has changed, but little progress. I do still struggle with masturbation, but I can keep an entire day without doing it, often going 2 or 3 days without doing so, though it gets extremely hard and I often find myself spiralling the more I talk about it. I do drink coffee, and still watch shows, but never gore, though I can't condemn whatever anyone decides to watch. I try not to swear, though I can't condemn those who do.

The most important shift I felt is by far love. I learnt to love you guys. Before, I grew cold, I had no love for anyone but myself. Now, I love everyone, with some notable exceptions. I'm still working on that.

I can't boast about my actions, that would cost me my reward. But my philosophy works just fine for me: do that which is necessary, nothing more, nothing less. I need to help more people, and quite frankly, I am very lazy, I still spend my entire days watching YouTube and playing chess, but I do so because I know that it is useless time not wasted because there is no Commandment against enjoying yourself. If I said there was a Commandment against spending time on my hobbies, though I might want to get a job to contribute, I do contribute in minor matters to my family.

**Summary on my personal experience**
I'm still the same person, just dimmer. It's as if I don't have that same fire in me that I used to have, I just can't put myself to commit to watching, say, action movies which I used to like a lot.

The experience has lead me to believe that there is no one right way to commit to Christ. The point is that you try. For some, that looks like watching action movies, but helping others on Mass. For others, that looks like discipline, legalism and helping wherever you can. What I do know, is that Christ is the judge, and I cannot put myself to judge others, as that would risk being the subject to my own judgment.

**The question**

1l2jbp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/comments/1l2jbp2/remission/,Remission,"Wanted some advice on remission. I started having severe vertigo attacks in 2021 once or twice that year in spring/summer. I take 8mg of betahistine 3 times a day and it would suddenly disappear. After a week or two with no symptoms I would stop taking them. 

Just over a year later I had another severe vertigo attack a day after I flown back from holiday. I think the plane and me drinking a lot of coffee and alcohol the day before didn‚Äôt help. Same again I would take betahistine and after a couple weeks be back to normal and stop taking them. 

2 and a half years later I‚Äôve experienced my worst cluster of attacks last month. It honestly broke me physically and mentally. My betahistine didn‚Äôt help at first and I was having severe attacks over 2 weeks. I think because it was going on for so long and I wasn‚Äôt able to work for 3 weeks really took a toll on my mental health. I have a beautiful family that I work hard for to provide an enjoyable life. I convinced myself this was it and I‚Äôm never going to get better. Wouldn‚Äôt be able to provide or look after my family and end up loosing everything. 

Fast forward to today I‚Äôm back to normal. Little more deaf. Louder tinnitus and balance slightly off. But the dreaded attacks have gone so im happy. 

I‚Äôm looking for advice on the length of remission. Should I be hoping for a longer remission than my last or could it all change and have more regular attacks?

I‚Äôm sorry for those who haven‚Äôt been as lucky as me with the length of remission and I wish everyday they find a cure for everyone with this horrible disease. ",2,1748974799.0,Menieres,2,1.0,False

Desde que descobri o caf√© de especialidade fiquei maravilhado com a diversidade de sabores que se podem encontrar, e acabei quase com a obsess√£o de provar mais caf√©s. Mas uma pessoa n√£o pode beber tanto caf√©...

...E os sacos de caf√© a rondar os 250g, muitas vezes acabam por ser muito caf√© para quem quer provar mais coisas diferentes (especialmente para o pessoal do caf√© filtrado). Ent√£o tive a ideia de fazer um coffee club ([post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cafeDeEspecialidade/comments/1jquzpd/coffee_club/)de apresenta√ß√£o da ideia aqui no sub do lado) onde encomendo v√°rios caf√©s de um roaster e o divido em sacos de algo a rondar as 100g e divido pelos participantes. 

Aqui o plano √© que todos possamos provar mais caf√©, ent√£o os custos (e os caf√©s) dividem-se por todos. 

A t√≠tulo de exemplo, a nossa [primeira encomenda](https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeetrip/comments/1kb44k2/coffee_club_1_la_cabra_abril_2025/), foi do [La Cabra](https://lacabra.com/), mandamos vir 7 caf√©s diferentes, o que deu pouco mais de 80g de cada caf√© a cada um. Foram ligeiramente menos de 600g de caf√© e saiu a 58‚Ç¨ para quem recebeu o caf√© em m√£o e 65‚Ç¨ para o que teve que ir pelo correio.

Somos cerca de 10 pessoas por agora, e temos tamb√©m um grupo de whatsapp, para discutir encomendas, caf√©s, equipamento, etc.

Vou apostar numa encomenda de 3 em 3 meses, sendo que a pr√≥xima dever√° ser para dia 1 de Julho, com o intuito de todos os participantes terem o caf√©, o mais tardar dia 15 de Julho. Roaster e caf√©s a decidir por todos.

Convido-vos a juntarem-se, se tiverem interesse. Seja pelas encomendas ou pela discuss√£o sobre tudo quanto seja caf√© de especialidade.

Se algu√©m quiser o convite para o grupo que comente ou mande mensagem, porque quando pus o link noutro post aqui no reddit, o grupo foi invadido por spam bots.",6,1748974480.0,cafept,6,1.0,False
