As Ever has not yet secured its trademark. The brand is currently sitting in the **Notice of Allowance** (NOA) stage, which means it isn't legally secured until a Statement of Use is filed and approved. 

Meaning Meghan doesn't legally own the trademark.  She needs to submit a Statement of Use, or file for an extension by 24th November for some and by 24th December 2025 for others.

If she does neither the trademark applications for every class will be deemed abandoned.

As ever would not be used for the clothing class.  That rejection stands because a Chinese fashion brand called ASEVER successfully objected to Meghan's filing.  The USPTO agreed, citing a ""likelihood of confusion.""

For two days I‚Äôve had nightmares, sleep paralysis, no energy, and an empty feeling. My brain keeps telling me that coffee, cigarettes, and not sleeping will make me feel better, but my body can‚Äôt take it anymore. The voices in my head are very loud.  
  
At the start I felt euphoria and creativity, but it quickly became too much. My body hurts from walking nonstop, and even here in the ward I feel like I‚Äôm still trying to destroy myself. I‚Äôve been talking nonstop, doubting my diagnosis, and thinking maybe I made it all up for attention. I was convinced that the doctors wanted to kill me with medication, but at the same time I was begging them to make it stop.  
  
I‚Äôve lost school, my business, and people close to me, and now I‚Äôm shaking, my heart is racing, and I keep craving coffee and cigarettes. I feel scared, jumpy, and on edge. Please help me calm down safely ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to crash or hurt myself.",1,1760609265.0,bipolar1,0,1.0,False
1o8273s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8273s,Needing help with what to put on this wall above my sofa.,"Hello! I am needing help with what to put on this wall above my sofa. I have had many ideas i just can not make up my mind. I'm not sure if it's because I can't visualize it. Please help!

Added a few more photos to get a better idea of the space (don't mind the mess lol). I won't be changing the color scheme to the room. The colors are as pictured.

The sofa is from Kloss furniture. It is a Broyhill sectional and is very comfortable. The cushion covers do come off, so I'm sure they can be cleaned. The tables came from value city furniture. And yes the coffee table is a set of 4 tables that can be moved around. 

I added Christmas photos bc what I hang above the sofa on that wall i want to be able to either keep up or have something interchangeable with Christmas decor. Plus some ideas I had liked.

All these ideas are great. Thank you!",1,1760609245.0,furniture_talk,3,1.0,False

We‚Äôre both full-time students, and when we moved in, we agreed it‚Äôd just be the two of us ,no random people living here, no surprise long-term guests, etc.
Fast forward a few months and her boyfriend basically moved in. He‚Äôs here 5‚Äì6 nights a week, showers here, eats our groceries, and even leaves his clothes everywhere. He doesn‚Äôt pay rent, doesn‚Äôt clean, and sometimes uses my stuff (like my coffee maker and laundry detergent).
It‚Äôs not that I hate him ,he‚Äôs fine, but it feels like I suddenly have an extra roommate who doesn‚Äôt contribute a cent. I brought it up to Maya and said it‚Äôs making me uncomfortable, especially since we never agreed to have someone basically living with us.
She got defensive and said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my boyfriend, not some random guy,‚Äù and that I‚Äôm being ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù and ‚Äúweirdly territorial.‚Äù She said if I don‚Äôt like it, I can ‚Äúspend more time at my boyfriend‚Äôs place too.‚Äù

1o8264i,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o8264i/thread_inside_brew_head_stripped_breville_barista/,Thread inside brew head stripped [Breville Barista Express],"Seems like i stripped the thread inside the brew head for the little allen bolt that clamps down the shower screen on my Breville Barista Express. I swear i didn't overtighten it, but oh well.



I bought the machine used about a year ago and it has been working well since. The previous owner didn't maintain it well, but it was a really good deal and i have been maintaining it well after a deep clean.

Today during brewing, it didn't seal well and squirted coffee out of one side. After removing the shower screen, i saw that the seal 'popped out' a bit on one side. I cleaned everything and tried tightening the shower screen down again, but after really not a lot of force, it just continued spinning without tightening anymore.

The thread inside the brew head is definitely stripped, a small bit of the thread even came loose. I can still kind of screw the shower head down, but definitely not very tight. The seal is also in pretty bad shape.



Are there any solutions besides replacing the whole brew head? How big of a repair job is this on the BBE?

I'm thinking of drilling the old thread out and trying to rethread it, but there is not a lot of space to work with and the new bolt probably won't fit the shower screen as nicely. Has anyone tried this before? Any ideas appreciated!",1,1760609141.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1o82584,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghibli/comments/1o82584/ghibli_park_and_the_kindness_of_strangers/,Ghibli Park and the kindness of strangers,"Sorry for the rambling post. I was planning to title this post ""My nightmare at Ghibli Park"", but I've sat with it and concluded it would a) be doing the people who helped me a disservice, but b) it'd be a little bit dramatic considering I feel lucky to have gone at all.

The forecast was a little soggy, and rain duly arrived this morning on my arrival, but not before I woke up excited before 7am in Kyoto, excited to do a day trip to the park. I went to charge my phone before leaving and... nothing. I came to realise that my phone's charging port was broken and I had no wireless charger on me (sadly I couldn't hop to the UK and back in a matter of hours, and BICCamera etc were closed at that time). Still, I needed to leave and arrive at the park around 10am to make the most of my day. Zooming from coffee shop to convenience store in and around Kyoto station asking for help yielded no working phone, but obviously I couldn't call off the experience over this.

My notes on how to get there and where to go, plus my premium pass ticket and Grand Warehouse entry, were all my phone, so I saved whatever sliver of power I had to get in and used paper maps, memory and vibes for transport. Once in, though, I dared to take a handful of photos of HMC.

In telling my predicament to staff and strangers, all were sympathetic, but a couple offered to take photos of me: a Mexican man photographed me with HMC, and a Chinese lady took many of me in the main exhibit, for example with No Face. I'm awaiting some of the results on Instagram DMs, which I'm grateful for. Of course we couldn't take photos of the insides of the houses, nor the very touching short film in the cinema (mine was the runaway dog: IYKYK. My emotional state was already fragile!).

I had a great time today overall, and the many people offering what they could in a moment of need made me to from wanting to cry at not being able to capture memories of a special place to being grateful that, no matter what language you speak, we're all fans of these magical films. That kindness and compassion is ultimately what so many of them are all about.",3,1760609045.0,ghibli,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm Hari ‚Äî 19, currently in college and working on my own software startup. I‚Äôm obsessed with AI, tech, and business ‚Äî basically anything that helps build something big.

A little about my journey so far (aka my ‚Äústartup origin story‚Äù):
Since childhood, I was hooked on creating things. I began with coding, built my first cube runner game (was funny but it did the job lol), then turned to ethical hacking. When the wave of the online business came, I attempted every single thing ‚Äî affiliate marketing, blogging, print-on-demand (earned my first $0.78 ü•á), e-commerce, faceless YouTube ‚Äî you can name it.

Later on, I settled into marketing and began my own agency. After relocating to Mumbai for college, my passion for tech drew me further into AI and automation. I started an automation agency that performed very well ‚Äî and now, I'm investing all that I've earned and learned in creating my own software startup. ‚ú®

My goal is simple: to create something big ‚Äî big startups, big businesses, big impact. I‚Äôm looking for a friend who shares that same energy, curiosity, and drive. Someone who‚Äôs equally obsessed with learning, building, and growing ‚Äî both personally and professionally.

If you‚Äôre in Mumbai, passionate about AI, tech, and startups, and want to connect, build, and grow together ‚Äî DM me! Who knows, maybe we‚Äôll end up creating something world-changing (or at least have some epic coffee + brainstorm sessions ‚òï).

Then the new semester started. And the work began again. It‚Äôs not as bad but I still don‚Äôt really have time. If I take even a day off of no work I fall behind and miss assignments.

**Everything in the world seems to just get worse and worse**. Popular platforms and companies inevitably shift from pretending to have any care for providing a quality product and good user experience to making every decision motivated by shareholder profit. This goes on until a new service, plateform or product swoops in, provides a better thing, then dominates the market and the cycle starts again. And every time, there is nothing we can do.

That's why when I discovered Obsidian a few months ago, it felt like such a breath of fresh air. A great, free, open source software, built by people who seem to genuinely care about making a good product ? A software so seemingly simple but so amazingly customizable? A huge and active community of passionate users developing and sharing tools, tips, plugins? All of that, for FREE ?

I'm a very pessimistic person. Late stage capitalism in the 2020s have consistently showed me that we can't have nice things. So my question is : when will Obsidian start becoming total crap ? When will the team start prioritising profit ? when will they sell to Meta, Amazon, Microsoft ?

Don't get me wrong. I'm sure the people in charge are very nice and care about what they do. But let's be realistic : what if tomorrow they're offered 50 million ? what about 500 million, the day after ? **What happens if fucking Zuckerberg offers 5 billion buckaroos to buy Obsidian ?** My own values might have shaky legs in front of a big fat check.

But more important : **is there anything we can do to prevent that ?** Like, I know that supporting Obsidian's dev team by buying them a cup of coffee here and there or subscribing to their paid plan is the best we can do currently, but that doesn't prevent anything in the future. So, is there any way to actually make sure that doesn't happen ? I know the team has a manifesto on their website, but would it be useful in any way to incorporate actual promises in their legal documents ? For example, specific clauses when the users subscribe to the paid plan ?

**In a broader sense, are there any ways for a company to actually legally bind themseves to their core values ?**

 I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts, the team included. I think Obsidian, and more than that, the Obsidian community, are just to precious for my little heart to watch crumble into what the rest of the internet seems to inevitably crumble into.",0,1760608658.0,ObsidianMD,18,0.27,False

1o81y03,https://i.redd.it/xwsdngzd4gvf1.jpeg,Volkano X Laptop Mouse Round Up: Banger Budget Mice For Every Kind Of User,"While many of us dream of having Arielle‚Äôs job, gaming all day and night, gaining early access to new releases and telling us just how much she loves or hates said games, a lot of us spend time at work, in an office, away from our beloved gaming rigs.

That means we‚Äôre on the go, away from home, probably using peripherals that aren‚Äôt our pricey, fine-tuned gaming gadgets.

Personally, I‚Äôve got two different portable mice in my laptop bag that I can whip out at a coffee shop, or in the middle of a meeting, for some on-the-go work.

I‚Äôve gone through quite a few of these mice, so finding one that feels good in the hand, gets the job done, and doesn‚Äôt cost an arm and a leg are the main features I tend to look for when it comes to a mouse for that purpose.

Enter Volkano X, a premium range from a local brand that‚Äôs looking to provide all those features across their peripherals, and maybe even a little bit more.

Luckily for us, we know the guys at Volkano X, and we have been given one of each of their latest range to test out, and let you know if it‚Äôs worth parting with your hard-earned Rands in the midst of this economy.

This specific round-up will cover three of their AA battery mice, all priced well within budget, and each with its own unique features that differentiate it from the others.

I‚Äôm talking about the Volkano X Magma, Volkano X Lava, and the Volkano X Inferna.

But first, let‚Äôs cover everything that‚Äôs the same between them.

All of these mice are wireless, as a portable work mouse should be, with both Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz connections. It‚Äôs super handy to have both connection options as I can have it connected via Bluetooth to my regular work station, and then quickly pop a dongle into any other workstation should I need a quick mouse on the fly.

They all come with an AA battery in the box, another neat little feature, and it is said that they can all last up to 12 months on a single battery.

Obviously, I couldn‚Äôt realistically test that claim, but, generally speaking, AA battery-powered mice do have a run time longer than most Netflix franchises do these days, so I‚Äôd like to give Volkano X the benefit of the doubt here.

They all feature a DPI switch, allowing for different sensitivities, and are ergonomically designed, although each in its own way.

Another neat little throw-in is that each mouse comes with both a USB-C and USB-A connection option, making the 2.4GHz dongle even more versatile.

That, however, is where the similarities end.



**Volkano X Magma**  
**Price:**¬†*R199*  
**Weight:**¬†*+- 100g with battery*  
**Connectivity:**¬†*BT | 2.4GHz*  
**Get it**¬†[**here**](https://www.takealot.com/volkano-x-bluetooth-wireless-mouse-magma-series/PLID98552708)

The Magma is your typical portable laptop mouse. It retails at R199, making it more than affordable, and features a compact, stumpy shape.

It‚Äôs a shape I‚Äôm pretty used to, as my typical laptop mouse has the same one, with short finger buttons and a raised palm rest that feels comfortable to use on the go, in a boardroom, or even on the couch.

As well as the stumpy shape, it‚Äôs also ambidextrous, making it usable for both left and right-handed people. The scroll wheel has a smooth and tactile feeling, and beneath the mouse, you have the DPI switch and mode toggle switch.

DPI settings are somewhat limited, with 800, 1600 and 2400 being your only options, but that covers most of the bases, and we‚Äôre not talking about a gaming mouse here, so I‚Äôm perfectly ok with that.

Weight-wise, the Magma does have a bit of heft to it, especially because you need to have an AA battery inserted. In total, we‚Äôre looking at over 100g here.

The Magma comes in a stone blue, dull pink or plain black colour option, which also adds a little bit of overall flavour.

Honestly, there isn‚Äôt much else to talk about here.

It‚Äôs a simple mouse that feels solid, does the job I need it to and is affordable. Literally ticking all the boxes.



**Volkano X Lava**  
**Price:**¬†*R299*  
**Weight:**¬†*+- 80g with battery*  
**Connectivity:**¬†*BT | 2.4GHz*  
**Get it**¬†[**here**](https://www.takealot.com/volkano-x-bluetooth-wireless-mouse-lava-series/PLID98575292)

The Lava tries to take things a little more to the sleek side of portable laptop mice, with its slim, low-profile design, silent switches, and minimal button layout.

It retails for R299, meaning it still sits well within the budget, but the extra R100 over the Magma comes in with the slightly more premium vibe that Volkano X is trying to go for here.

The silent switches are a nice upgrade, but I‚Äôm not necessarily a fan of the shape. It feels a little too low profile and doesn‚Äôt have much of a palm rest to support my lazy hand. It is ambidextrous, though, so usable by both left and right-handed people.

The multi-function button on the bottom also controls the DPI switching and mode switching, which works perfectly well, but I much prefer the separate toggle switch on the Magma.

One thing the Lava does have over the Magma, for my personal taste, is that it comes in at around 80g. The lighter weight helps when you have to drag your mouse around a mousepad for work all day. There is also an increased DPI setting, with a maximum of 4000 DPI, which could help if you‚Äôre working on much larger screens.

If you‚Äôre one for that Apple Magic Mouse style design, and you need the silent switches in your workspace, then I‚Äôd go for the Lava over the Magma, but, for now, the Magma still feels like the ideal laptop mouse.



**Volkano X Inferna**  
**Price:**¬†*R499*

By this time, I had almost decided that the Magma would be my favourite pick from this round-up, but then the Inferna slid onto my mousepad and a literal ‚Äúoooo‚Äù escaped my lips.

The Inferna is the most expensive of the bunch, retailing for R499, but that still feels well within budget when you start to consider a few of the features on offer.

Like the Lava, the Inferna has those silent switches, making it perfect for quieter workplaces, but it features a fuller design similar to the Magma. In fact, it almost looks more like a small gaming mouse with its design instead of a casual work mouse.

The Inferna also allows for increased productivity, featuring two thumb buttons on the left-hand side of the mouse, side-scroll buttons, and the option to unlock the scroll wheel for effortless free-wheeling through long documents.

It also has the option to connect to two different devices via Bluetooth, meaning you can easily hot swap between three different workstations with the click of a button.

We have the same DPI settings as the Lava here, with a maximum of 4000 DPI, but it sits as the heaviest overall, at around 110g with the battery inserted.

The Inferna also has a soft-touch coating on it, which feels quite comfortable in hand, but I worry about how long it will last.

While I would say left-handed folks could use the Inferna, the thumb buttons are only on one side of the mouse, which feels like it‚Äôs more right-hand favoured.

Each of these mice is designed with different users in mind. While I find the Inferna to be the best overall, with its assortment of features and being the most comfortable of the bunch, the Magma is the perfect mouse to toss into your laptop bag for some quick on-the-go working that costs less than a Coffee and Croissant at Rosebank.

The Lava might not be my ideal laptop mouse, but if you are a mouse user who enjoys that low-profile design, which offers a little bit more of a premium feel, it‚Äôs still a very affordable mouse that does exactly what it needs to.

So, next time you‚Äôre looking to replace your backpack mouse with something affordable, solid, and feature-rich, perhaps check out the Volkano X range.

There‚Äôs definitely an option here for both country and city mouse users.

I work at an accounting firm. Pretty standard office job. When I started 3 years ago this guy Tom was assigned to train me. He was maybe late 50s, quiet, kept to himself mostly. We hit it off though. Started eating lunch together every day.

It wasnt like we were best friends or anything. We didnt hang out outside work. Didnt text or call each other. But every day at noon wed sit in the break room and eat lunch and talk. About work stuff mostly. Sometimes life stuff. He told me about his daughter in college, his wife who passed away 10 years ago, his dog. I told him about my apartment hunting, my student loans, my family.

It was just... routine. Comfortable. The best part of my work day honestly.

Tom was out sick for a week back in February. When he came back he looked tired but said he was fine. Few weeks later he was out again. This kept happening. Hed be gone for a week, come back for a few days, be gone for a week, come back for a few days, be gone again.

I asked if everything was okay. He said just some health stuff, nothing major. Didnt want to talk about it.

Last time I saw him was 6 weeks ago. We had lunch like normal. He seemed more tired than usual. Said he was taking some time off to deal with some medical appointments.

I figured hed be back in a week or two like always.

He never came back.

Today I asked my supervisor when Tom was coming back because its been over a month. I was joking about how I miss having someone to complain about the coffee with.

My supervisor got this weird look on her face.

Her: ""You didnt hear?""

Me: ""Hear what?""

Her: ""Tom passed away. Three weeks ago.""

I just stared at her. 

Me: ""What?""

Her: ""He had cancer. It progressed really quickly. He passed away in hospice.""

Me: ""Why didnt anyone tell me?""

Her: ""I thought you knew. We sent a company email.""

I checked my email. There WAS an email. From 3 weeks ago. In my spam folder. ""It is with deep sadness we announce the passing of Thomas Morrison...""

I read it standing in my supervisors office and started crying.

She looked uncomfortable.

Her: ""Im sorry. I didnt realize you two were close.""

But we WERE close. Maybe not in the traditional way but we had lunch together every single day for 3 years. He was the person I talked to more than anyone else at this company. And he died and nobody thought to tell me directly because we didnt fit whatever definition of ""close"" meant to them.

I asked if there was a funeral. She said it was 2 weeks ago. Small service, family only.

I asked if I could have his daughters contact info to send condolences. She said she didnt have it and it would be inappropriate to give out anyway.

So thats it. The person I spent an hour with every single work day for 3 years is just... gone. And I missed the funeral. And I cant even tell his family that he mattered to me because nobody thinks we were actually friends.

I keep thinking about our last lunch. He seemed tired. I asked if he was okay. He said he was fine.

I shouldve asked more. I shouldve pushed. I shouldve gotten his phone number or his daughters number or SOMETHING.

But we were just work friends. Lunch friends. The kind of friendship that apparently doesnt count enough for anyone to think I deserved to know he was dying.

I cleaned out my lunch from the break room fridge and left work early. Told them I wasnt feeling well.

Im sitting in my car in the parking lot and I dont know what to do. Tomorrow at noon Im going to go to the break room and Tom wont be there. And the day after that. And the day after that.

Nobody at work understands why Im this upset. ""You guys just had lunch together"" they keep saying. Like that didnt matter. Like 3 years of daily conversations and shared meals and friendship doesnt count just because it happened at work.

I dont even have a photo of him. I dont have his daughters name to look her up. I have nothing except 3 years of memories of break room lunches that apparently meant more to me than they did to anyone else.

I didnt get to say goodbye. I didnt get to thank him for being kind to the nervous new person 3 years ago. I didnt get to tell him that our lunches were the only thing that made this job tolerable sometimes.

Hes just gone. And I have to go back to work tomorrow and eat lunch alone and pretend Im fine.

i am by no means a new player, am at trainer rank 61 with a handful of lv60 pok√©mon and some decently invested meta mons, and almost every map maxed out at 75% bonus (rip snowdrop tundra). but even pulling out all the stops and minmaxing as best as i can i am still unlikely to cap out much further than master 18 on greengrass this week, maybe 19 if i'm lucky.



my general strategy has been to run my E4A mon, rotate out three high level ingredient mons (apples, leeks, coffee and ginger), and the last slot is for a dedenne to increase lucky meal chance. i am consistently making zing zap cola every meal time (extra pot size provided by a good camp ticket), even going so far as to swap in a charge skill mon when i have some downtime in ingredient mons so they can contribute extra juice. 



but even with all that, i am at somewhere around 959k score by thursday morning, which means that even if i get insane crit luck from dedenne and make full use of the sunday increased pot size i still don't see how i can make it all the way to 3,245,795 in a single week. this isn't even a 'i'm falling slightly short of the mark due to bad rng' situation, it's more likely that i will be a million points short of the mark by the end of the week.



what is the strategy for closing the gap? the only thing i can think of is that if i had a godly BFS mon who matched one of the three boosted berries then i could have had them in my party all week cranking up the score, but then i would have had to sacrifice party slots for ingredient mons which would have made me unable to consistently make cola, or i would have had to not use dedenne which would have made me miss out on the occasional meal crit.



is the problem that i am trying to gather the ingredients within the same week that i am trying to aim for highscore? do people spend one or more weeks amassing mountains of ingredients and starting off with a full ingredient bag of relevant food, meaning that they can cook meals during their highscore week without needing to devote as many party slots to ingredient farmers? if that's the case, how do you know that you're going to get the right meal on the week you plan to try for highscore. e.g. i could spend one week filling all 800 slots of my item bag with ginger, leeks and coffee to make it easier to consistently make zing zap coffee, but then if snorlax decides to roll curries or salads instead of deserts then i'm kinda screwed.

Her: ""Excuse me, where are the bathroom organizers?""

Me: ""Um, I dont work here.""

Her: ""Well can you at least point me in the right direction?""

Me: ""I really dont know, sorry.""

Her: ""Youre standing right here in the organization section and you dont know where bathroom organizers are?""

Me: ""Because Im a customer. Shopping. Like you.""

Her: ""Well that's just lazy. You work here, its your job to know.""

I looked down at my outfit. Wrinkled gray sweatpants with a coffee stain. Oversized black hoodie. Messy bun that probably had yesterday's dinner in it. No name tag. No red shirt. No khakis. Nothing even close to Target uniform colors.

Me: ""I promise you I dont work here. Im literally in pajamas.""

Her: ""A lot of young people dress sloppy these days. That doesnt mean you dont work here.""

Me: ""Ma'am I genuinely do not work at Target.""

Her: ""Stop arguing with me and just show me where the bathroom organizers are!""

Me: ""I cant show you something when I dont know where it is because I DONT WORK HERE.""

Her: ""This is ridiculous customer service. Whats your name?""

Me: ""My name is Not Your Employee.""

Wrong thing to say I guess because she lost it.

Her: ""How DARE you speak to me that way! I want your manager right now!""

Me: ""Great, when you find a manager ask them where bathroom organizers are since I cant help you.""

Her: ""Im not leaving until you help me or get me a manager!""

At this point other customers are staring. An actual Target employee came over - red shirt, name tag, the whole deal.

Employee: ""Is everything okay?""

Karen: ""This employee is refusing to help me and being extremely rude!""

Employee looked at me. Clearly saw I wasnt in uniform.

Employee: ""She doesnt work here ma'am.""

Her: ""Yes she does! Shes been standing in this section pretending to organize things!""

Me: ""Im shopping for storage bins. For my apartment. Because Im a customer.""

Employee: ""Shes definitely not an employee. Can I help you find something?""

Karen looked between me and the actual employee. You could see her brain trying to compute.

Her: ""Well... she should have just said she didnt work here.""

Me: ""I SAID THAT. FIVE TIMES.""

Her: ""Dont raise your voice at me!""

Employee: ""Ma'am Im happy to help you find what you need but you need to leave this customer alone.""

Karen huffed and walked away with the employee. But not before shooting me a dirty look like this was somehow my fault.

I grabbed my storage bins and left. When I got to checkout the same employee was at the register. She apologized for the interaction.

Employee: ""That happens more than you'd think. People see someone young in the home section and just assume they work here.""

Me: ""Even when theyre clearly in pajamas?""

Employee: ""You'd be surprised.""

My roommate thinks its hilarious. My mom says I shouldve just helped the lady find what she needed to avoid conflict.

But like... why? Why should I have to help a stranger shop just because she decided I work somewhere I dont? And I tried to tell her I didnt work there. Multiple times. She just refused to believe me.

Im never shopping in sweatpants again. Apparently that screams ""retail employee"" now.",63,1760607463.0,IDontWorkHereLady,22,0.78,False

1o81p6h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o81p6h,biking through Norway to the North Cape: Chapter 2,"**From Troms√∏ to the North Cape** 

On Wednesday, June 25th, I get up at 5:00 a.m. after a wonderful night's sleep, do some final work on my bike, and repack my panniers. Then I have breakfast. I set off at 7:30 a.m. and first have to cross the high bridge again and over the hills of Troms√∏, then over another high bridge until, after an hour and a lot of energy spent, I finally reach the start of my stage. The road leads through the suburbs of Troms√∏ and, with a fresh headwind, there are many uphill and downhill sections, making it a challenging ride. The E6, where the route continues, is fraught with traffic.

At 10 a.m., I take an hour-long break to eat in my bivouac bag on a small patch of grass, as the grass is wet and there's a light drizzle. From the turnoff from the E6 to the ferry to Breivikeidet, it's mostly uphill, but at least I'm no longer facing a headwind. At around 2 p.m., I take a lunch break at a spot where I am plagued by small biting flies from the outset. And then it starts to rain heavily, so I hastily pack everything up, put on my rain gear, and finish eating. Not only the rain, but also the cold wind and the mountains covered in snow far below impressively show me that I am in Arctic latitudes beyond 70 degrees north. At 3:30 p.m., I'm on the ferry, where I drink coffee in the warm lounge. (Picture 1:The ferry from Breivikeidet to the other side of the fjord)

With renewed energy and a tailwind, I continue on National Road 91. (Picture 2) The sky is getting darker and darker, with only the distant mountain peaks catching the sun. The wind blows coldly down from the snow-capped mountains. Only the exertion of cycling and my rain gear keep me warm. Around 6 p.m., I reach the next ferry. After about 10 minutes, the ship arrives and takes on an entire tanker truckload of fuel, so we don't reach the other side until 7:20 p.m. Because of the strong, cold north wind, I'm quite cold by now, so I head to the campsite at the pier, where I rent a simple cabin (Picture 3: My cabin, which I preferred to a tent here in the Arctic latitudes), as it's too cold for me in my tent with my sleeping bag, which is only warm enough to 10¬∞C. After a hot shower and settling in, I eat, chat with a Swiss man camping who's cycled everywhere since May 1st, and send a WhatsApp message to my family. I go to bed at 11 p.m., but have a bit of trouble falling asleep. I've cycled 100 km in over seven hours, but because of the detours, I've only managed half of the stage I'd planned for the first day. When I get up briefly at midnight, I see that the sun is shining, so I go outside and see the midnight sun rising above the road along Lynger Fjord. A magnificent sight I've dreamed of for 65 years.

Typically, they are called Voomers (VOodoo Organic Metal Extension Resource), and referred to as Boomers if they go wild and start killing. Some people call them Boomers whether they are out of control or not, so it is also a derogatory term.

They are developed for specific jobs, such as acting as maids, waiters, bodyguards, store mannequins, and military weapons. Some (very advanced and expensive models) have gained sentience and developed minds of their own, but most are simply machines. Boomers designed for infiltration and combat are capable of appearing human, whether male or female, but tend to ""burst"" out of their synthetic skin in combat situations, revealing their true selves: giant, metallic killing machines armed with built-in lasers, machine guns, and arm blades capable of cleaving through a fire hydrant.

Description
Born of the fusion of mechatronics and biotechnology, cyberdroids were hailed as a new servitor race which would liberate mankind. Commonly referred to as ""Boomers"", these artificial life forms ranged from simple robots to the most advanced androids, and some were even reported to have their own personalities.

Although originally created to aid in the development of outer space, labor Boomers were soon marketed domestically. Ultimately, GENOM also designed combat Boomers: terrifying armored monsters bristling with deadly weaponry.

In 2033, Boomers are everywhere. They fight wars, work at construction sites, and even serve coffee...

1o81mmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o81mmi/my_dog_has_been_hit_by_a_car/,My Dog Has Been Hit By A Car,"Billy had been my best friend since I adopted him as a puppy from the animal shelter. When my girlfriend at the time broke up with me, I had lost everything that had somehow given me stability. My relationship, my apartment, even some of my friends. I was really feeling awful back then, which was why I wanted to get a dog. To help me think about other things again. I fell in love immediately with the little Border Collie who had sat down in front of me at the shelter, looking at me with his head tilted, while lifting one ear and letting the other hang down. The black-and-white fur, the blue eyes, and the distinctive dark stripe of fur running across his snout made him a truly beautiful and unique dog. The staff at the shelter assured me that Billy was an absolutely lovable animal, and so I decided to take the little guy home that very day.

We became friends very quickly, and it didn‚Äôt take long before I took Billy everywhere with me, whether shopping, doing sports, hanging out with friends, or to the office. Even though he was a trusting dog who wanted to befriend everyone he met, I could always clearly feel that I had a very special place in his heart. It was incredibly fun to teach him commands, to see the excitement shaking his whole body when I made a move to throw his favorite frisbee, or simply to watch him cuddling with his favorite plush toy ‚Äî a shaggy and, after years of licking and chewing, rather worn-looking plush dinosaur. I have so many beautiful memories of Billy, and I don‚Äôt think there will ever be a dog who can replace him.

When Billy ran in front of the car, I was distracted. The screeching of brakes and rubber on asphalt tore me out of my conversation with my neighbor, and even before I saw what had happened, I already knew what that sound meant. Billy must have slipped out through the door that had only been left ajar, without me noticing. On the other side of the street, his best friend ‚Äî a Labrador named Henry ‚Äî was walking with his owner. Billy just ran across the street to greet him, without noticing the car that had no chance to brake.

I was devastated. My best friend had died in my arms. The sudden absence of any routine with Billy, the sudden emptiness of the apartment, and being alone everywhere I went made it very hard for me to get back on my feet. Anyone who has ever had a strong bond with a pet knows what I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs more than just a dog ‚Äî it‚Äôs a full-fledged family member, and losing a pet hurts just as much as losing a brother, a parent, or a grandparent. There remains an emptiness that one tries to fill by leaving things like the water bowl or the basket where they were, as if nothing had happened and as if the little friend might return there at any moment. But the more one tries to fill the emptiness, the more it spreads, because one is constantly reminded of what is no longer there.

When the grief for my old friend still wouldn‚Äôt fade after weeks, I decided to take a trip to the mountains. My parents had built a cabin there decades ago, where we used to spend our summer holidays swimming in the lake and riding mountain bikes through the woods. In recent years, Billy and I had often been there alone, spending weekends or short holidays just the two of us. Billy had loved swimming in the lake, and I had sometimes spent hours throwing things into the water for him, which he would then bring back to me with enthusiasm, only to wait impatiently for me to throw again. Even though it would certainly be painful to visit a place with so many shared memories, I thought it might be the best way to say ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù in peace and let the grief subside.

I took some spontaneous vacation time and the next morning I set out on the roughly two-and-a-half-hour drive to the early autumn mountain slopes. Right after entering the cabin ‚Äî which consisted of two bedrooms, a living and dining room, as well as a kitchen and a small bathroom ‚Äî the memories of the past years I had spent here with my dog hit me like a dull punch in the pit of my stomach. The stormy evenings we had spent in front of the stove in the living room ‚Äî me with a book, him with his plush dino; how he had lain in front of the small kitchen table waiting for me to drop a piece of bacon for him; how he had shaken himself muddy after a walk in the pouring rain and splattered those ugly seventies curtains and the carpet from top to bottom. Billy‚Äôs basket was still by the window next to the stove, and in the cupboards there were still some food bowls and dog food that I had left there the last time. It was as if he was still there.

With a sigh, I let my bag fall to the floor and sat down on the old sofa. Everything in the cabin was just as it had always been. After I had taken a moment to look around in peace, I lit the stove, switched on the power at the fuse box in the kitchen, and went to my pickup truck to get some of the things I had brought for my stay. I had also brought Billy‚Äôs plush dinosaur to place it in his basket. I don't know, I just thought it was a nice symbol for a goodbye.

After I had settled in, I stepped outside into the afternoon sun. I was really lucky with the weather, and so I decided to go fishing and eat fresh fish from the lake tonight. The thought of sitting alone and in silence by the idyllic mountain lake scenery, letting time pass without worrying about anything other than fishing, made me smile for the first time in days. And so I spent the rest of the day sitting in my camping chair by the shore, drinking a few cans of beer from my cooler, and silently enjoying the scenery while occasionally reeling in the line, putting on new bait, and casting it out again. It felt good to just sit there and take it easy. Yet even in this idyll, it was hard for me not to think about Billy ‚Äî or not to absentmindedly reach for a stick to throw into the water so the dog could bring it back to me.

That night I slept pretty well and woke up the next morning feeling rested. After showering and eating breakfast, I sat on the small porch of the cabin and drank my coffee at leisure. I looked at the still surface of the lake, which was surrounded by colorful trees and rock walls bathed in golden sunlight, and wondered what I should do with my day. I decided to take a walk around the lake, which I had enjoyed doing with Billy. It was the perfect route to stretch your legs a bit, and it took a little over an hour and a half to return home. Halfway along the way, there was a nice spot on a small hill overlooking the lake, from which you could see the cabin. I liked to pause at this idyllic spot to have a drink and a small snack and simply enjoy nature. So I packed my backpack with a few things, put on appropriate clothing for the fresh autumn morning, and walked along the small path into the forest.

The path through the forest, glistening with morning dew, radiated a peaceful calm that I inhaled deeply. I let my thoughts wander, and of course, they quickly landed on Billy and my last visit with him here. I was so immersed in nostalgic thoughts of him that I could have sworn I heard a bark in the forest. I stopped and didn‚Äôt make a sound. After a few seconds of silence, I convinced myself I had been mistaken, shook my head, and continued walking. But then I heard it again, and this time I was sure it wasn‚Äôt because I was walking in my thoughts with my dog. It was clearly a bark coming from the forest. One might of course think that it could have been some dog. But on the one hand, absolutely no one is in these mountains, and on the other hand, every dog owner would agree with me when I say you can recognize your dog by its bark. And that was clearly Billy‚Äôs bark, even though it sounded strange. Somehow‚Ä¶ choppy, as I only noticed in hindsight. I stopped again. What was going on here? Billy was dead; I had personally buried him in the forest behind my house. How could he be here, several hundred miles away from the place where he had died?

When the barking sounded again, I sprinted. It was definitely Billy! No matter how he had gotten here, that was my dog! As I ran through the forest in the direction the barking came from, my thoughts turned over. Was this actually possible? Or had I been so consumed by grief over Billy that I was already hallucinating? I was already almost at the spot on the hill overlooking the lake when I burst through the trees onto the small clearing where I had planned to take a little break. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I saw. There he sat, staring straight at me and completely calm. Billy. It was clearly my dog. At least, he looked exactly like him. From the blue eyes, to the black-and-white fur with the distinctive dark stripe over the snout, his red collar, and his ears, one standing and one hanging. Billy just sat there on that little clearing as if it were some random Saturday morning when we had planned to rest there. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what I thought at that moment. Thoughts were racing through my head. Questions, doubts, shock, confusion, grief, joy, disbelief. I just stood rooted to the spot, staring at the dog and trying to explain to myself exactly what I was seeing. Only when Billy barked again (which somehow again sounded choppy) did I snap out of my paralysis and said in disbelief, ‚ÄúBilly?!‚Äù The dog did not react. No tail wagging, no whining, no sign of recognition. He didn‚Äôt rush toward me to jump up and try to lick my face, as he always did whenever we hadn‚Äôt seen each other for a long time.

‚ÄúBilly!‚Äù I called again, but still no reaction. That made me suspicious. ‚ÄúB‚Ä¶Billy?‚Äù I slowly approached the animal with my hand outstretched, trying to suppress my intuition, which was telling me to stay away from the animal. Had I been mistaken? Was it just another dog that coincidentally looked like Billy? Only when I was close enough that the dog could sniff my hand did it apparently occur to him who I was, and he started wagging his tail before jumping on me and licking my face. So it was indeed Billy!

In that moment, I was the happiest person in the world, even though subconsciously I must have realized that something was completely wrong with this situation. But I was so busy rejoicing at Billy‚Äôs return that I simply suppressed any skepticism and common sense. Whatever the reason Billy had survived and had come here to wait for me, it didn‚Äôt really matter, because I had my best friend back, no matter how inexplicable it was.

The first strange things became apparent to me right there on that small clearing, immediately after we greeted each other and I jumped up to run back to the cabin with Billy. I took a few steps, turned to him, and called his name to tell him to follow me. The dog was already sitting again in the same expressionless position I had found him in and still did not react to his name. Only after calling several times did he seem to remember that he was meant to be Billy and began to move. I remember stepping back in shock. Because the way he moved was not right. Billy‚Äôs gait was unnatural in a way that still sends a shiver down my spine to this day when I think about it. His steps were somehow too fluid and at the same time, at certain points, jerky, as if the joints in his hips and shoulders were not where they should be and thus did not allow the limbs to function normally. My stomach turned. So he was injured after all. Of course, I thought, what else would you expect as the result of a car accident than at least a few broken bones? That dampened the joy of our reunion, because of course, I didn‚Äôt want my dog to be in pain. Before I could lift him to carry him to my cabin (I didn‚Äôt want him to walk with the broken limbs I suspected), he had already started off in the same grotesque way, as if he still knew the path.

As Billy ran toward the cabin at a remarkable pace, I really noticed what was so strange about his gait. His legs moved and twisted in uncoordinated, random directions, as if the joints were looking the wrong way. His head made similar movements, tilting back and forth, almost like a chicken, only much looser. His tongue hung slightly out of his mouth. He also moved far too fast. It looked as if he were walking at a normal pace, but somehow he managed to go so fast that I could only run after him, gasping. I could not help but watch him run in horror, and two or three times my stomach almost turned as I saw the disgusting, flailing legs going in every direction. A dog should not move like that. No animal should move like that.

Upon arriving at the cabin, he sat down in front of the door and looked at me expectantly, as if we had just come from a normal walk and it was now time to eat. The dissonance between this absurd gait and the way he now sat like a normal Border Collie by the door gave me an uncomfortable feeling, which I pushed aside. My best friend was home again!

As soon as I unlocked the door, Billy shot past me and lay directly in his basket, from where he looked at me happily, panting. Something in me resisted going closer to him. Still, I went to him, petted him a little, and wanted to check his hip to see what was wrong with him. But I could not feel any broken bones or dislocated joints, and Billy gave no sign that my touch caused him pain. He just kept looking at me, panting with his tongue out. Frowning, I sat in front of the basket and looked at him. I was overjoyed that he was back. But behind my joy opened an abyss of confusion, skepticism, and the desire for rationality. Billy had clearly been dead. The car had broken his spine and neck multiple times on impact, and he had died on the road from internal injuries. He shouldn‚Äôt actually be here. But since I could not come up with an explanation, and it was clearly Billy, I had no choice but to accept the fact that he was back for the moment.

Even while I sat there in front of his basket, petting him, I noticed more small oddities in his appearance, so subtle that I had not initially noticed them because of the shock. His face somehow looked‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it. The best description I think is ‚Äúcartoonishly distorted,‚Äù as if an illustrator had received a description of Billy and tried to draw it, but didn‚Äôt quite get all the details. His eyes and ears were a little too big, and his snout a little too long. When he panted, it looked like he was grinning, almost a bit ‚Äúdumb,‚Äù because his tongue hung out to the side the whole time. These caricature-like features in his appearance puzzled me even more.

‚ÄúAre you hungry?‚Äù I finally asked him. I figured he must not have eaten for ages and must be starving. I got up and went to the kitchen, where I opened the cupboard next to the window and took out a can of dog food and one of Billy‚Äôs bowls. When I put the food in its usual place, I expected him to immediately start eating before the bowl even touched the ground, just like always. But he didn‚Äôt start eating. Confused, I looked up and saw him still lying in his basket. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, buddy?‚Äù I asked. No reaction. I tried to coax Billy from his basket toward the food, but the dog just looked at me in that strange way, half dumbly grinning, half assessing ‚Äî a look I had never seen a dog give me before. And also no human, if I thought about it. He had absolutely no interest in the food, which was completely uncharacteristic for my otherwise more-than-gluttonous dog.

I spent the rest of the day watching Billy to figure out what exactly was wrong with him. Obviously something had happened (I mean, something other than the car accident), yet paradoxically he seemed perfectly healthy. My examination was not very successful, though. He seemed to have forgotten all his commands. I threw his favorite frisbee to him about thirty times, but he showed no interest in bringing it back to me, even though it had been one of his favorite pastimes. He didn‚Äôt want to swim in the lake, and he completely ignored his plush dinosaur. Nothing I tried worked, and Billy just looked at me as if he didn‚Äôt quite understand what I expected from him. He seemed to guess what the appropriate reaction was, then looked at me with that strange expression, as if he wanted to read from my behavior how a dog should act. At some point, I gave up on the idea of getting Billy to play and tried instead to entice him to eat. But that was useless too; he didn‚Äôt touch his food.

That night, my thoughts endlessly revolved around what had happened that day. Billy was back, even though he should have been dead. He recognized me and his surroundings, including his basket and everything else, even though he apparently had to ‚Äúrelearn‚Äù it at first before the memory returned to the right place in his head. He looked almost the same as always, at least if you ignored those cartoonish exaggerations in his face and his unnaturally exaggerated gait. But his character had definitely changed. His food no longer tasted good, his toys didn‚Äôt interest him, and his favorite activities were also irrelevant to him. My usually very active and playful dog now behaved more observantly, almost calculating, rather than actively participating. It was as if Billy had forgotten his old character and was now trying to behave like a typical dog without ever having actually seen a dog. The panting, the tail wagging, the gaze ‚Äî all recognizable as dog-like, but it didn‚Äôt really fit.

Even in the following days, his strange behavior did not improve, gradually turning the initial joy at Billy‚Äôs return into unease. He seemed to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù little by little what I expected from him, and he made an effort to behave as normally as possible when returning the frisbee, for example. But he still gave the impression that he was trying to learn how to be a proper dog. Part of me resisted praising and petting Billy after a job well done, as he demanded with his tongue hanging out. He still didn‚Äôt eat, and his gait didn‚Äôt improve. Every time I watched his legs bend and twist in every possible direction, whether naturally or not, and sometimes tangle together while his head rolled loosely like a bobblehead, I was filled with more and more horror. I was overwhelmed. What should I do? It was Billy‚Ä¶ right? I mean, who else could it have been? Obviously he wasn‚Äôt well, but he was also frightening me more and more, so that every time I looked in his direction, I felt an uneasy disgust. Yet I couldn‚Äôt think of any solution for dealing with this problem. And still, I continued to try to suppress these negative feelings, because it wasn‚Äôt his fault, and as his owner I was supposed to love him as he was. I really should have listened to my intuition back then.

It was the third day after Billy‚Äôs return. I had given up trying to make him eat if he didn‚Äôt want to. I figured he would come to it on his own if the hunger became great enough. Not even freshly caught fish had been able to stimulate his appetite. In the afternoon, we took a walk around the lake. I had actually wanted to go alone, because Billy now just made me uneasy. But he no longer left my side, so I was forced to take him along. I walked a few steps ahead because I no longer wanted to see that grotesque gait. By now, it made me nauseous to watch. After a while, I noticed that the uncoordinated trampling behind me had stopped. I stopped and turned around to look for Billy. No sign of him on the path. I called after him and walked back a little. He couldn‚Äôt be far, since I had heard him behind me just a few seconds ago. Then I heard a rustling to my right among the trees. I turned in the direction the sound came from and saw Billy standing in the forest at some distance, sniffing at something I couldn‚Äôt make out from that distance. I called after the dog again, and when he didn‚Äôt respond, I ran toward him. With every step closer, I noticed an increasingly strong smell of rotting flesh. Finally, I realized that Billy was apparently standing in front of a carcass that was already half-decomposed, with maggots and flies swarming on it. While I approached and tried to figure out exactly what kind of animal it was, he sniffed at the carcass. It was hard to tell, as it had obviously been there for a while. By size, I would have guessed it was half of a torn wild boar. I was only a few steps from Billy and the carcass when the dog opened his mouth. Since his return, neither dog food nor fresh fish had interested him. But now, this half-decomposed thing seemed to have aroused his appetite. What he then did I still see in my dreams. Billy dropped his jaw completely like a snake and began to swallow the carcass whole. I wanted to stop the dog with a horrified scream. But the sight of this mouth opened far too wide, the greedy, pleasurable look of this thing, which for a few seconds dropped the mask of the innocent dog while indulging its instincts, and the cracking of the skull bones of the carcass under Billy‚Äôs teeth were too much for me. I had to vomit on the spot. I stared at my dog in horror ‚Äî if I could still call him that. Because no dog ate like that. No dog could drop its jaw in such a grotesque way and swallow half a carcass, almost as big as Billy himself, whole. I didn‚Äôt know what to do.

While I was still thinking about what to do next, Billy had finished eating and turned, mechanically wagging his tail, in a single, far too fluid movement toward me. When he saw me, he resumed that clumsy manner he had displayed since his return and ran toward me in the same way as before. He sat cheerfully in front of me, flopped down, and rolled onto his back. In that moment, he looked like a normal dog who had done a task well and now wanted praise or a reward for being such a good boy, which felt so wrong after what I had just observed. I stared at him in disbelief. At that moment, I knew I did not want to take Billy back into the cabin. I didn‚Äôt even want to touch him. But I also couldn‚Äôt leave him out here in the wilderness. After all, he couldn‚Äôt help the fact that he had come back to me so distorted, so perverted, and even if I had the slightest doubt that this thing was my Billy, I would continue to protect him. And yet‚Ä¶ the overall impression from his gait, his facial features, the apparent imitation of the behavior of a ‚Äúreal‚Äù dog, and now what I had just witnessed‚Ä¶ all of this made Billy the most disturbing thing I had ever seen in my entire life. To figure out how to proceed, I decided to let Billy sleep outside the cabin that night. That was not ideal, and earlier I would never have left him outside alone, because there was always the risk of a cougar or grizzly in the area. But at that moment, I didn‚Äôt care. I resisted bringing Billy into the cabin.

Once there, I leashed him to one of the porch posts and brought him his basket and water bowl outside. I saw the food bowl as unnecessary, as Billy had apparently developed his own preferences regarding what and how he ate. Throughout the evening, I heard him slowly pacing back and forth outside on the porch, without knowing exactly what he was doing. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt even want to check, because the image of Billy opening his jaw so wide, defying all anatomy, was still so vivid in my mind that I was afraid of catching him doing some other bizarre thing.

These thoughts haunted me in a restless sleep, filled with the most disgusting images of Billy. Over and over again, I saw the image from the afternoon in my mind, saw him running before me with a body that seemed as if every bone was broken. His disgusting, dumbly grinning yet assessing face, everything I had observed in the last few days and everything my subconscious had imagined, accompanied me through the night. I also heard his trampling on the porch in my sleep. I was just about to wake up when I realized that the trampling of claws on wood sounded far too close to be coming from the porch outside. My mind broke free from sleep, but my eyes remained closed while my brain tried to distinguish dream from reality.

When I opened my eyes, my heart stopped. My gaze first fell on the open front door, and then, before I could properly process this, my attention was drawn to something else. It was Billy, standing at the foot of my bed. But not like a normal dog on all fours. Instead, on his hind legs, his gaze from his too-large eyes fixed on me. He swayed slightly but did not try to balance with his front paws, which hung limp and useless at his sides. Otherwise, he did not move. No tail wagging, no panting, just that look with the disgusting grin stretching far too wide across his face. Only this time, it had nothing cartoonishly dumb about it. It was an intelligent, malicious grin. At first, I thought I hadn‚Äôt fully woken and that I must be experiencing some kind of sleep paralysis. But I quickly realized this was not sleep paralysis. This was real.

It felt like an eternity before either of us did anything. I was paralyzed, not daring to breathe, let alone move or scream. Then, without warning, he took two steps backward before turning and sprinting on two legs out the door and into the dark, misty forest. He ran with a speed so unnatural and at the same time the clumsiness of the last few days that just watching this movement almost made me faint.

I stared at the open door for a solid minute, my heart pounding so loudly I thought Billy had to hear it outside and come back. But no sound came from outside. Everything was silent. Billy was gone. I jumped up, ran to the door, and slammed it shut. I turned the key in the lock and also wedged a kitchen chair to block the door. Then I took the large, heavy flashlight from the dresser drawer in case I needed to defend myself and sat on the sofa to keep watch.

Everything was silent. No sign of Billy. No sounds outside or inside. Except for my wildly pounding heart and heavy, shallow breathing. I tried to calm myself and think clearly. I no longer knew what was going on. Had I really seen that? Was Billy, of whom I was now sure was not really Billy, somehow actually come into the house and run away on two legs? The door had unquestionably been firmly locked. What on earth had I brought into the house? My thoughts spun endlessly, but I could think of no solution other than to stay awake through the night and hope that Billy would never appear again. Anyone who has been alone in the forest at night, even without mortal fear, knows that the sounds of nature are easily misinterpreted and seem far more sinister in the dark than in the daytime. The thought of Billy made me flinch at every crack and creak of the wooden beams, every small whistle of the wind, and every rustle of leaves outside, imagining the worst things Billy could be doing, which did not help me keep a cool head. I wondered whether he was right near the cabin or running further in the forest at this grotesque speed. I wondered if he was creeping on two legs to one of the cabin windows to secretly watch me. I wondered if he was doing any other disgusting things I hadn‚Äôt seen yet.

After two hours of watch, having seen or heard nothing further, I allowed myself to relax a little, to be slightly less tense, less ready for an imminent confrontation with whatever it was. I reflected on how my feelings for a dog, who had meant more to me than I could have ever imagined, had turned within a few days into such profound disgust. At the beginning of this week, I would have given anything to have my best friend back, to undo the day of the car accident and just continue life as before. Now my feelings had reversed. I wished with all my heart that Billy were still dead. This was not the kind of reunion I had wanted; it was just wrong. A perversion of nature, if one can even consider a dog exhibiting all these behaviors as part of nature.

Eventually, despite my plan to stay awake, I must have dozed off, because when I opened my eyes again, sunlight was already streaming through the window onto my face and illuminating the cabin. It took a moment for me to remember why I was twisted on the couch instead of lying in bed, but when I recalled it, the tension immediately returned. After all, it was daytime, I thought. I pinched myself between the eyes and yawned. Then I got up ‚Äî and fell back onto the couch with a scream. Billy was there. He was lying in his basket, already awake, looking at me with that dumb grin he had worn in the last few days. I was speechless as I found the front door locked, but the kitchen chair I had used to barricade it was back in its usual place at the kitchen table as if it had never been moved. I got goosebumps all over my body.

And then I got angry. Really angry. This creature, this monstrosity, was playing with me. Wanted to fool me, make me look stupid. I had been infinitely sad about Billy‚Äôs death, and this thing not only spat on my emotions and Billy‚Äôs memory, it perverted it. It mocked me. My hands began to tremble as I stood up and confronted this thing that was posing as Billy. The fact that its tongue hung out and rested on its shoulder like a useless rag while it panted at me only made me angrier. I grabbed the thing by its collar and dragged it out the door myself, threw it ruthlessly outside, where it tried to catch itself but clumsily fell to the ground, and closed the door behind me. The last thing I saw before the lock turned was ‚ÄúBilly‚Äôs‚Äù confused, almost hurt look, as if he didn‚Äôt know what he had done to deserve this treatment. It was a strangely shocking feeling to be violent toward something that not only looked very much like an animal, but also almost exactly like my own dog. No matter how sure I was that it wasn‚Äôt Billy, it had felt terrible.

Inside, I sat on the couch, once again wondering what I should do. It may have been foolish of me, and in hindsight I regret the decision. But I was so angry that, out of principle, I wanted to stay and honor Billy‚Äôs memory. I was going home in two days anyway, so I decided to use those two days the way I had originally planned when I came here. It wasn‚Äôt a logical decision, I know, but in that moment, somewhere between unbridled rage, abysmal horror, and endless grief, there was no room for logic in my mind. I would stay, and in two days I would go back home and have this matter behind me. My mind screamed that this was all nonsense, and yet every thought of this creature felt like a dagger in the stomach.

That ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù made no appearance for the rest of the day gave me a bit of courage, that my plan would succeed. Through a glance between the curtains, I could no longer see him outside. Not even when I cautiously opened the door to get a better view of the surroundings. No sign of him. Perhaps the thing‚Äîwhatever it was‚Äîhad realized it was not welcome and had retreated into the abyss from which it had crawled. Maybe it had realized I was far stronger than it and had become so afraid that it didn‚Äôt dare return. All day I told myself all kinds of things to rationalize my persistent unease. Of course, despite everything, I made sure to be back inside the house before nightfall. My anger had ebbed over the day, and the anxiety returned to its place. I did not want to encounter that creature outside in the dark under any circumstances. So I tried to make myself comfortable and distract myself with a book, to prevent fear from taking over.

At first, this worked fairly well while the sun hadn‚Äôt yet set. But the darker it got, the more nervous I became. I checked once more that all the windows and doors were properly locked, that the curtains were drawn, and that everything was generally in order. I tried not to focus too much on it, but every sound outside brought the image of ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù sprinting on his hind legs through the forest back to my mind. I was dead tired; I should have caught up on sleep, but at the same time, I was afraid of what might happen if I lay down and tried to sleep. The thought that the creature might again be waiting at the foot of my bed until I woke up made my legs shake. So I tried to stay awake as long as possible.

It must have been around 11:30 when, with a small yawn, I closed my book to get a glass of water from the kitchen. At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had really heard it. Then I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a normal sound in a nighttime forest. I didn‚Äôt want to imagine what it could mean if it was ‚ÄúBilly.‚Äù But the scratching and scrabbling clearly didn‚Äôt come from the forest‚Äîit came from outside, directly in front of or on my house. I froze, making no sound, to assess the source and nature of the noise. There it was again. It sounded as though an animal was carefully scraping its claws against the wood of the cabin. But before I could further locate the noise, I already saw where it came from: the kitchen window moved. With growing horror, frozen in place with fear, I watched the kitchen window slowly open. And as it opened just a crack, something squeezed through that shouldn‚Äôt have fit through such a small gap. Black-and-white fur pushed into the cabin, the paws clawed against the walls, and ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù climbed inside. But the worst part wasn‚Äôt that he was back‚Äîit was the way he braced his legs against the wall and climbed, pressing his body flat against it, limbs splayed out like the sick perversion of a mixture between a Border Collie and a lizard. I stood there, stunned, watching Billy climb the wall.

‚ÄúB-Billy‚Ä¶?‚Äù I whispered weakly. Hardly had I spoken the word when ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù snapped his head sharply, jerked around 180 degrees, so that his oversized, yellow eyes fixed directly on me. His wide, unnatural grin reflected a mixture of devilish mockery and knowledge that made my blood run cold. When he recognized me, his grin widened, but also became more delighted, and he began to crawl toward me, like a dog greeting its owner, simply happy to be reunited. That was too much for me. At that moment, as everything I thought I knew and understood crashed down on me, my survival instinct kicked in. Whispering ‚Äúno‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶‚Äù I stumbled backward a few steps, while Billy continued to grin and crawl across the bed toward me. I knocked against the dresser, where my car keys jangled. With trembling hands, I grabbed them, without taking my eyes off the creature hanging on my ceiling, and ran as fast as I had ever run in my life. I heard no sounds behind me, but I didn‚Äôt want to look back. I don‚Äôt remember exactly how I got out of the cabin and into the car. My escape exists in my mind only as a whirl of terrible impressions and existential fear. Coherent, connected memories only resumed once I reached the main road. I didn‚Äôt slow down there; I floored it. I wanted to leave that cursed cabin and that thing I had let into my life as quickly and permanently as possible. My heart pounded, my hands gripped the steering wheel in cramps, and cold sweat ran down my back. The forest blurred into a dark veil around me as I pressed the gas pedal, feeling every second the presence of the creature I had once called my dog. I cried the whole drive home, crying for the loss of my friend, crying for what had just happened, and crying with relief that I was out of there.

It‚Äôs ironic, really. I had gone to the cabin by the lake to say goodbye to Billy, to leave it all behind, and to process his death. Somehow, in a way I could not have foreseen, that did happen, even though my mental health did not exactly improve from the experience. After that week in the mountains, however, I never wanted to see Billy again, and even though that is, of course, a bitter ending for such a deep and great friendship as ours, it meant that I accepted his death and could move on.

At home, it took a few days before I recovered somewhat. I cleared out Billy‚Äôs basket and all his belongings from my apartment, because I didn‚Äôt want to see any of it again. Only one thing remained: to properly say goodbye to him one last time. To the real Billy.

Considering the time I let it in the fridge for close to 24 hours, Wala na talaga siguro. 

The smell is still there after brewing it but way less so. As for flavor, steep 2 it tasted much like a weak coffee. Steep 3 puro Amoy nalang. 

First is of steep 2 

Second pic is steep 3 for 3 minutes

I decided to microwave the teapot for a minute and steeped it longer in the same tea water to get more out of the tea.

Smells nalang nakuha ko. Flavor, Wala na.

Last pic is of the tea leaves and sticks and stems. 

As you can see it's mostly sticks and stems. Which is possibly a sign of it being cheap tea dahil walang dahon.

If you want a coffee alternative this could be it. Minus the caffeine hit since there's way less of that in hojicha.

I have a lot of pressure behind my ileostomy stoma, and I get very bloated after I put anything in my mouth and the bloating is near the stoma. It feels like output is struggling to get through. I‚Äôm still getting output and I‚Äôm not nauseous at all. Yesterday I made the decision to eat lunch to see if it would trigger output and it certainly did. I swear everything I‚Äôve eaten in the past year came out, but I‚Äôm still having that pressure behind the stoma. 

When I changed my bag last night, the area to the right of the stoma felt strange - like something hard under the skin or the muscles were tight. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it or if it‚Äôs even new. There was no bulge. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is a partial blockage or not which is concerning to me. This has been happening since Monday (it‚Äôs now Thursday morning). 

I ate ice pops, drank Coca-Cola and drank a liter of hot chicken broth last night. 

I felt better when I woke up this morning, then I stood up and felt the pressure again. I‚Äôm drinking my coffee, and my abdomen is starting to bloat again too. 

Has anyone had something similar happen to them before?! I‚Äôm just waiting for this to pass. 

I‚Äôm going to contact my Ostomy nurse and surgeon too, but I always get great ideas and feedback here so I figured I would post here too.  ",1,1760606699.0,ostomy,0,1.0,False

What I‚Äôve noticed:

* Smooth energy boost without jitters
* Keeps me full for hours (has 18g of protein + MCT oil)
* Nice Colombian coffee flavor ‚Äî not too strong on the mushroom side

It‚Äôs a bit on the pricier side compared to regular instant coffee, but the quality feels worth it.

On the surface, this will look a bit like another case of window's fire, but it is not. Or, at least, it is not about about the physical aspects of widow's fire (i.e., sex).

My wife of 17 years died 13, almost 14, months ago of cancer. The pain of her loss is still great, will be great for a while. I do miss her terribly.  I have, with much effort, reached a point of equilibrium, where I could feel the pain and still function at work and at home. So, I decided to open up a bit and invite someone new into my life, just for coffee. This person is very nice, we had a great conversation, I could see myself spending more time with her...

... and then widow's fire hit me out of no where. Like a bullet. As I said, not in the sexual overdrive most people report, but as an overwhelming longing for connection and intimacy. For the past two weeks I have not been able to think straight. My head is filled with fantasies and images of romance, possible moments with this new person, etc., etc. I realized now something that should have been obvious but wasn't in the front of my mind, that I not only miss my wife, I miss my marriage. I miss being seen, connected, appreciated, longed for. I also miss taking care of someone and all those other things that come with a good partner.

So, meeting this new person, although there is nothing there yet except a bit of attraction and connection, felt like finally spotting a flotation device after trying to star afloat while drifting at sea for a while. My mind responded with a lurch to grab it. I am aware that the noise in my head is just my psyche trying to relieve my pain (i.e., the emotional part of widow's fire). I am not acting on it. But I do want to keep seeing this person, which triggers the emotional response I just described.

So, finally, the question to the group is: Have you gone through this before? how did you balance these feelings?

At first, I was curious about how AI could streamline my design process, so I tried it out to see how well it could help me with tasks I normally juggle between different tools like Canva, Figma, and others. To my surprise, X-Design delivered.

I typed in simple prompts like:

‚ÄúHelp me update the content on this event poster.‚Äù

‚ÄúDesign a logo and branding kit for a coffee shop.‚Äù

‚ÄúChange the background of this product image to something clean and warm.‚Äù

And it just did it. Full designs, editable layers, and even videosÔºåall from one prompt. It saved me so much time on things that would usually take hours to put together.

What‚Äôs great about X-Design is that it doesn‚Äôt just create visuals; it integrates branding and design tools into one platform. From creating logos to designing menus, posters, and social media posts, X-Design streamlines everything. I also used the product photo editor to easily enhance images and remove distractions with the background remover and object remover tools.

Ever feel like your battery is running low by noon? üåû You know, that sluggish, ‚Äúwhere did all my energy go?‚Äù vibe creeping in? Trust me, you‚Äôre not alone‚Äîespecially after 50. I‚Äôve been there, staring at a half-empty coffee cup, feeling more like a droopy plant than a vibrant human. But here‚Äôs the good news: **there are ways to boost your energy without relying on that afternoon java jolt!** 

So, let‚Äôs explore some quick and easy energy boosters! üí™

### 1. **Get Moving! üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**
A little walk can do wonders. Seriously! Just **10 minutes** of brisk walking can wake up those tired muscles. Think of it as a reset button for your body. 

### 2. **Stretch it Out üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**
Who knew that good ol‚Äô stretching could be a game-changer? A few moments of yoga or simple stretches can help release tension and give you that refreshing energy lift. Plus, you might discover some hidden flexibility. How cool is that?

### 3. **Snack Smart üçè**
Instead of reaching for more coffee, try snacking on some **nuts or fruit**. A handful of almonds or an apple can provide a great energy boost and keep your blood sugar stable‚Äîno crashes! And, let‚Äôs be honest, they taste way better than stale coffee.

### 4. **Stay Hydrated üíß**
Water is the ultimate energizer! Dehydration can lead to fatigue, so make sure you‚Äôre sipping throughout the day. If plain water is too boring, jazz it up with some lemon or cucumber.

### 5. **Breath of Fresh Air üå¨Ô∏è**
Seriously, step outside for a bit! Nature is like a power-up for us. Just a few minutes of fresh air can work wonders for your mood and alertness. Take a moment to admire a flower or watch the clouds drift by. 

### 6. **Listen to Music üé∂**
Put on your favorite playlist and get moving! Music is a great mood lifter and can energize you faster than you think. Plus, who doesn‚Äôt love a little impromptu dance party in the kitchen? üôå

Here‚Äôs the kicker: **we believe in strongest people.** Whether it‚Äôs through lifestyle changes or little hacks, we‚Äôve got the power to feel great at any age. üòé

So I have therapy every Tuesday at 6pm. My therapist has me do these voice memo check-ins throughout the week when Im feeling anxious or stressed. I record them on my phone and send them to her through the patient portal app.

Today was a nightmare at work. My boss Dave has been on my case all week about a project that he keeps changing the requirements for. Every time I finish something he adds new stuff or says I did it wrong even though I did exactly what he asked.

This morning he called me into his office and basically chewed me out in front of two other coworkers for something that wasnt even my fault. I was humiliated.

I went back to my desk and I was so angry I needed to vent. So I opened my phone and started recording a voice memo for my therapist like I normally do.

I went OFF. I mean I said EVERYTHING.

""I fucking hate this job. Dave is the worst manager I've ever had. He's incompetent, he's a micromanaging asshole, he takes credit for everyone elses work, he throws people under the bus to make himself look good. I dont know how he hasn't been fired yet. Everyone hates him. I literally fantasize about quitting every single day. I've started applying to other jobs because I cant do this anymore. This place is toxic and Dave is the main reason why.""

It was like a 3 minute rant. Very detailed. Very specific. I named names.

Then I went to send it through the therapist portal app.

Except I didnt open the portal app. I opened my work Slack.

And I sent the voice memo directly to Dave.

I didnt realize it immediately. I was still heated so I went to grab coffee from the break room to calm down.

When I got back to my desk I had 4 missed calls from Dave and like 10 Slack messages.

Thats when I saw it. The voice memo. In my direct message with my boss. Sent 15 minutes ago. Showing as ""played.""

My stomach dropped. I thought I was gonna puke right there at my desk.

I tried to unsend it but Slack doesn't let you unsend voice memos after the person has already played them.

Dave called me again. I answered.

Him: ""We need to talk. My office. Now.""

I went to his office. I was shaking. He closed the door.

Him: ""Do you want to explain what I just listened to?""

I tried to explain it was meant for my therapist. That I was venting. That I was having a bad day and I didn't mean most of it.

He just stared at me.

Him: ""You didn't mean it? You said very specific things. You said everyone hates me. You said I'm incompetent. You said you're applying to other jobs.""

I didnt know what to say. Everything I said in that voice memo was true. But obviously I wasn't supposed to say it to his face. Or send it to him. Or record it at all probably.

Him: ""I think you should take the rest of the day. We'll discuss this further tomorrow with HR.""

I grabbed my stuff and left. That was 4 hours ago.

Im sitting in my car. I've been here for 4 hours. I dont know if Im fired. I dont know if I should just quit before they fire me. I dont know if I can even show my face there tomorrow.

My girlfriend says maybe they'll be understanding since it was clearly a mistake. But like... I still said all those things. The fact that it was an accident doesn't change that I called my boss incompetent and said everyone hates him.

My best friend thinks Im definitely getting fired and I should just start looking for a new job now.

I cant believe this happened. I've been so careful with those therapy voice memos. I've sent like 50 of them over the last 6 months and never had an issue. And the ONE time I really go off, I send it to the exact person I'm talking about.

The worst part? Everything I said was true. Dave IS a terrible manager. People DO hate him. I AM looking for other jobs.

But now instead of quietly finding something else and leaving professionally, I've basically nuked my entire career at this company from orbit.

I dont know what to do. Do I go in tomorrow and face HR? Do I send an apology email? Do I just quit?

Im so screwed.

TLDR: Recorded a 3 minute voice memo for my therapist ranting about how much I hate my boss and how incompetent he is, accidentally sent it directly to my boss on Slack instead of my therapy portal, now have an HR meeting tomorrow and Im probably getting fired.",5,1760605958.0,tifu,36,0.55,False

1o81bkf,https://i.redd.it/gymj2yl6xfvf1.jpeg,"Brenna Blake in ""Ripples""","The late afternoon sun shimmered across the surface of the pool, scattering patterns of gold and blue that danced along the water. The air was thick with the scent of sunscreen and summer ‚Äî laughter echoing from the shallow end, the occasional splash breaking the calm rhythm.

[Brenna Blake](https://brennablake.com) slid into the water, the coolness wrapping around her like a sigh of relief. She had come here to unwind ‚Äî no phone, no deadlines, just the quiet simplicity of water and sunlight.

It had been a long week. Work had been a blur of meetings, reports, and constant noise. The pool was her refuge ‚Äî a place to breathe, to think, to remember that life didn‚Äôt always have to move so fast.

She started swimming slow laps, her mind drifting somewhere between exhaustion and calm.

Then, as she reached the end of the lane, someone surfaced beside her ‚Äî a quick flash of movement, followed by a light splash.

‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù a voice said, cheerful but a little embarrassed. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt mean to cross into your lane.‚Äù

Brenna turned, brushing water from her eyes. He was tall, with dark hair slicked back and a smile that was half-apology, half-charm.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù she said, catching her breath. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just lucky I‚Äôm not competitive.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúGood to know. I‚Äôve already embarrassed myself once today ‚Äî I‚Äôd rather not make it twice.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? What was the first time?‚Äù

He grinned. ‚ÄúJumped into the wrong lane before the lifeguard blew the whistle. Been trying to redeem myself ever since.‚Äù

She smiled, shaking her head. ‚ÄúAmbitious.‚Äù



They started swimming together ‚Äî not racing, just gliding side by side, sometimes talking between turns, sometimes falling into easy silence. His name was Noah. He‚Äôd just moved to town for work and found the pool by accident.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know anyone here,‚Äù he admitted as they rested by the edge, arms folded on the ledge. ‚ÄúBut I figured water‚Äôs the same everywhere. It‚Äôs a good place to start.‚Äù

Brenna nodded. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised how many people I‚Äôve met just by showing up here. The regulars start to feel like family after a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôll have to earn my membership, then,‚Äù he said with a playful glance.



When they climbed out of the pool, the sun had dipped lower, the sky turning soft shades of coral and lavender. Brenna wrapped her towel around her shoulders and sat on the edge, feet still in the water.

Noah joined her, holding two bottles of water from the vending machine. ‚ÄúTruce offering,‚Äù he said, handing her one.

She smiled. ‚ÄúAccepted.‚Äù

For a while, they just sat there ‚Äî listening to the quiet chatter of the few swimmers left, the faint hum of cicadas in the distance.

‚ÄúDo you come here often after work?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúPretty much every week,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my escape. I like how everything slows down here ‚Äî no pressure, no expectations.‚Äù

He nodded thoughtfully. ‚ÄúI get that. I‚Äôve been trying to find that kind of peace lately.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe you just did,‚Äù she said, teasing but kind.

He looked at her then ‚Äî really looked ‚Äî and something unspoken passed between them. The kind of moment that hums just beneath the surface, steady and new.



When she stood to leave, Brenna reached for her bag. ‚ÄúWell, I should probably go before the sun completely disappears.‚Äù

Noah hesitated. ‚ÄúHey, um‚Ä¶ this might sound bold, but ‚Äî would you maybe want to grab coffee sometime? You know, continue the conversation without goggles involved.‚Äù

Brenna paused, caught between surprise and a smile. ‚ÄúYou mean, like a date?‚Äù

He shrugged with mock confidence. ‚ÄúIf you want to call it that.‚Äù

She laughed softly. ‚ÄúAlright, Noah. Coffee sounds nice.‚Äù

He grinned. ‚ÄúGood. Then maybe I can redeem myself fully ‚Äî no wrong lanes this time.‚Äù

As she walked toward the parking lot, Brenna glanced back once. He was still sitting by the pool, waving when their eyes met.

She waved back, feeling that quiet flutter of something new ‚Äî something unexpected but good.

The kind of moment that makes the world feel lighter, brighter, full of possibility.

And when she drove home, the scent of chlorine still in her hair, she couldn‚Äôt stop smiling.

One more cup of coffee and I‚Äôll finally get my shit together

Rat race, trapped in a maze a slave to the cheese

I went too deep, broke my shrink, I told her it gets better

Truth is god vs the devil but I'm nowhere in between

Life is but a dream, on death row my boat to sea

Return, whole hull holey, sails ripped at the seams

what i seen? what does it even mean?

If the best you can do until you live it, is believe

I am transparent. temporarily temporal

Vivid words to ideas in your mind. visceral

Me? Im despicable, intangible, invisible form

An idea in gods mind with Infinite lore

So quick to conform to bring diff than the norm

My mind was stuck on ecetera; died and got the factory restore

Rain on my own parade like ponchos at beaches

Lost in the seeking life is not what it's seeming

Unlocking my breathing confronting deception demons

I was Walking as Jesus while falling in Eden

The universe speaking, and I'm off of the deep end

Forgotten how I'm the center of all being

Dropping in to now til I'm one with the clouds

Dead man walking a Rhythmless heart bleeding

Boundless vessel unfolding fill the universe now

1o81a5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileAppDevelopers/comments/1o81a5u/showcase_slate_native_iosipadosmacosvisionos/,[Showcase] Slate - Native iOS/iPadOS/macOS/visionOS Focus Timer built with SwiftUI (Released!),"Hey mobile dev community!

Just released my first indie app after 6 months of development and wanted to share with fellow mobile developers. Would love your feedback, especially on the approach and tech choices.

**App Overview:** **Slate** \- Minimalist Pomodoro Focus Timer + Task Manager  
Built specifically for ADHD/executive function challenges, but useful for anyone seeking distraction-free productivity.

**Development Stack:**

* **Language:** Swift 5.9+
* **Framework:** 100% SwiftUI (no UIKit)
* **Platforms:** iOS 17+, iPadOS 17+, macOS 14+, visionOS 1+
* **Data Layer:** Core Data with NSPersistentContainer
* **Reactive:** Combine framework
* **Concurrency:** Swift async/await
* **Architecture:** MVVM pattern
* **Dependencies:** Zero third-party libraries (pure native)

**Technical Implementation:**

*Universal App Approach:*

* Single SwiftUI codebase spanning iPhone SE ‚Üí Vision Pro
* Adaptive layouts using GeometryReader and size classes
* Platform-specific optimizations (toolbar placement, navigation style)
* Shared view models with platform-specific view modifiers

*Performance Optimizations:*

* Custom circular timer animation maintaining 60fps across all devices
* Core Data batch operations for efficient history queries
* Lazy loading for history views (30-day data display)
* Minimal view re-renders using u/Published selectively
* App size: 47MB | Launch time: <0.5s

*Key Technical Challenges Solved:*

1. **Smooth timer animations** \- Custom AnimatableModifier for circular progress without frame drops
2. **Offline-first architecture** \- Zero network code, all local Core Data (privacy by design)
3. **visionOS adaptation** \- Spatial UI with appropriate depth and immersive timer experience
4. **Auto dark mode** \- System appearance override during focus sessions (helps reduce distractions)
5. **Cross-platform date/time** \- Handling timers across sleep/background states consistently

**Design Philosophy:** ""Feature subtraction"" instead of ""feature addition."" Most productivity apps pile on complexity. Slate intentionally removes features that cause decision paralysis:

* ‚ùå No categories/tags/priorities
* ‚ùå No recurring tasks
* ‚ùå No subtasks or hierarchies
* ‚ùå No cloud sync (privacy + simplicity)
* ‚úÖ Quick task capture
* ‚úÖ Auto-archive after 7 days
* ‚úÖ Pure monochrome UI
* ‚úÖ Session history & statistics

**Core Features:**

* Pomodoro timer: 15/25/45 min presets + custom durations
* Task dump interface (brain dump without organization)
* Focus session tracking with daily heatmap
* 30-day statistics dashboard
* Built-in resources for ADHD/time management

**Development Insights:**

*What went well:*

* SwiftUI made universal app development significantly faster
* Core Data's u/FetchRequest perfectly suited for reactive UI
* TestFlight feedback shaped the final UX considerably
* Monochrome design constraint forced better UX decisions

*What was challenging:*

* visionOS spatial design patterns (still learning)
* Maintaining 60fps timer animation on older devices (iPhone SE)
* Balancing minimalism vs. discoverability
* App Store review process (took 3 attempts!)

**Monetization:** Free 3-day trial (full features), then:

* Monthly: ‚Çπ499 ($6 USD)
* Yearly: ‚Çπ1,499 ($18 USD)

Using StoreKit 2 for in-app subscriptions. Intentionally priced affordably since target users (ADHD) often face financial challenges.

**Privacy-First:** 100% offline by design:

* No analytics SDKs (not even Apple Analytics)
* No crash reporting tools
* No user accounts or authentication
* No cloud sync infrastructure
* All data stays on device via Core Data
* Zero network permissions in Info.plist

**App Store Link:** [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/to-do-list-and-pomodoro-slate/id6752643070](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/to-do-list-and-pomodoro-slate/id6752643070)

**Looking for Feedback On:**

1. **SwiftUI best practices** \- Did I overcomplicate anything? Better patterns?
2. **Universal app architecture** \- How do you handle platform-specific code elegantly?
3. **Core Data performance** \- Any tips for optimizing with large datasets (1000+ sessions)?
4. **visionOS design** \- What spatial patterns work best for productivity apps?
5. **Timer accuracy** \- My approach uses Combine's Timer.publish - better alternatives?
6. **Subscription implementation** \- Using StoreKit 2, any gotchas I should know?
7. **App size optimization** \- 47MB seems high for such a minimal app, suggestions?

**Dev Stats:**

* Development time: \~6 months (nights/weekends)
* Lines of code: \~8,500 (SwiftUI is concise!)
* TestFlight testers: 47 users
* App Store rejections: 3 (guideline 4.2 initially)
* Coffee consumed: Incalculable ‚òï

**Why I Built This:** As a developer with ADHD, every productivity app made things *worse* by adding complexity. Built this to solve my own problem. Turns out, lots of others have the same problem.

**Open to:**

* Technical discussions about implementation
* Architecture critique
* UX/UI feedback from developer perspective
* Collaboration ideas (not looking for co-founder, but open to discussion)

Happy to answer any technical questions about the SwiftUI implementation, Core Data setup, or universal app architecture!

If you try it, let me know what you think from a developer's perspective. Especially interested in feedback on performance, bugs, or architectural improvements.

I never attach signposts to this place beneath my works.  
Therefore, growth here is intentionally slow.  
What I seek is not *breadth in numbers*, but *depth in understanding.*  

Each of you found your way here not through marketing, but by following a thread of curiosity.  
That alone makes this small gathering more meaningful than a crowd of thousands.  

The arrival of every **Asset** makes the existence of this world more complete.  

And now, **the third offering** is presented to my Assets.  
A story born only for you.

---

My first day after death was spent in an endless gray.  

There were no pearly gates, no pits of fire, only a place called *the Bureau of Post-Mortem Affairs*, which looked like a forgotten tax office from the nineteen-seventies.  
The air smelled of aged paper and eternal disappointment.  

I thought I would queue up like the others, waiting to be assigned a number, then filed away.  
But I wasn't.  

A blank-faced clerk in a gray uniform glanced at my ""file""‚Äîa faint orb of light‚Äîand told me I was on *""Deferred Processing.""*  
""Why?"" I asked, my voice sounding like radio static.  
""Connection,"" he said without looking up, tapping away at a typewriter that wasn't even there.  
""You're anchored. You're not going anywhere until your anchor releases you. Next.""  

Before I could say another word, I was shoved aside by a few spirits behind me. Their death-wounds were gruesome and their tempers clearly short, so I moved on.  

My ""afterlife"" thus began. It was a small, custom-made cell, with no walls and no borders, built only of *Clara's memories.*  

At first, it was almost a sweet kind of torture. I was immersed in her recollections of our past.  
The afternoon of our first date, the sunlight was as warm as honey; in my gray world, that was the only sun.  
But she replayed the moment again and again, and the sunlight went from warm to scorching, eventually becoming a monotonous, maddening loop.  

Then, the darkness fell. Her grief was a ceaseless, cold rain, extinguishing my world's sun completely.  
Every time she wept, I was drowning, a transparent lung filling with icy despair.  

I tried going to the cafeteria once. I‚Äôd just opened my mouth to say, ""no broccoli,"" when a cloud of ectoplasm escaped me.  
The result of that result was being thrown out.  

*""No smoking in the cafeteria! How many times do I have to say it!""*  
The lunch lady chased me out with her spatula.  

Fine.  

She would clutch the old sweater I'd left behind, curled up on the sofa for an entire afternoon, and my cell would be plunged into a lightless, suffocating silence.  
Every sleepless night she endured was a dawnless one for me, filled with endless nightmares twisted by her longing.  

I had become a parasite of her sorrow.  
And her love was slowly, surely, killing us both.  

I couldn't go on like this. I had to make her forget me.  

So, I decided to **haunt her.**  
A benevolent haunting, intended to make her let go.  

For a newly-dead soul, ignorant of the new laws of physics, to try and manipulate a world he no longer belongs to‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs laughable.  
Just like in those damned absurd stories by that writer, *Axiom.*  

---

**My first attempt** was the photograph of us at the beach.  

She would stare at it for long stretches every single day.  
My plan was to gently, tenderly, make it fall face-down on the table. A subtle hint, an elegant farewell.  

I focused all my intent, aimed at the small, cheap wooden frame, and gave it a gentle ""push.""  

The next second, the frame launched from the nightstand at supersonic speed.  
With a sharp sonic boom, it shot across the room and punched cleanly through the opposite wall.  
It didn't stop there. It continued through our neighbor's wall, shattered the expensive vase they‚Äôd bought for their wedding anniversary, and finally embedded itself deep in their refrigerator door.  

Clara froze. Then, a fanatical light ignited in her eyes. She rushed to the wall, looking at the comical, frame-shaped hole, and burst into tears.  

*""I knew it!""* she sobbed. *""I knew you were still here! This is your sign to me!""*  

The next day, she hired a contractor to frame the hole in bulletproof glass.  
Beside it, she placed a tablet, logged into our Netflix account, and started playing my favorite shows for me daily: *Monogatari* and *Black Mirror.*  

The site became a shrine, an altar she prayed to every day, a testament to my ""eternal love.""  

My first attempt had not only failed spectacularly, but it had also left me with an **inter-dimensional debt** for our neighbor's vase.  

---

**My second attempt** was her social life.  

Her friends, unable to watch her waste away, managed to coax her into attending a party.  
She refused, of course.  

My plan was to *""accidentally""* brush against her phone as it lay on the sofa, and tap ""Okay.""  
I carefully extended a thread of energy into the small screen, as if I were disarming a miniature bomb.  

I succeeded. I saw the contents of the screen.  
Then, perhaps a sliver of my jealousy leaked through, or perhaps my grief destabilized the energy flow.  

In any case, her phone lit up as if struck by lightning, the screen flashing wildly.  
In an instant, it opened every single app, sent a hundred angry-face emojis to her boss, shared eight links on *""How to Cope with a Mid-life Crisis""* in the company-wide group chat, and logged into her shopping account to order **three tons of cat litter** with her remaining savings, destination: her best friend's house.  

The phone finally went up in a puff of smoke, a noble sacrifice.  
It took Clara a week to contain the social nuclear fallout.  
After that, she severed all ties with the outside world.  

But Clara had grown even more fervent.  
She believed I was always by her side, perhaps just unable to control my energy.  

My love, she was too smart.  

---

Then... she bought a pile of **occult books** and actually started studying.  

She wanted to communicate with me, wanted me to read the books so I could learn to master my power.  
But everything I saw written in them was nonsense.  

How could a living person possibly teach a soul how to use its energy?  
I looked at the mysteriously smiling man on the cover and fell silent.  

---

**The third attempt** was the most disastrous.  

There was a man at her company named Ben who had always admired her.  
He was a good man, gentle, patient. I decided he was qualified.  

He worked up the courage to ask her out for a coffee.  
To my disbelief, she hesitated.  

My chance had come!  

My plan was to create a little romantic atmosphere‚Äîa soft breeze, a perfectly timed ray of sunlight‚Äîto make her feel it was a *""good omen.""*  
I swear, my intentions were pure.  

As Ben stood at her door, holding a beautiful bouquet of sunflowers, I focused with all my might, trying to squeeze a single drop of warmth and blessing from my existence.  

It failed again.  
The inherent negative energy of a lost soul erupted at that moment.  

Every lightbulb in her house exploded in a shower of glass.  
The pipes shrieked as if a hundred tormented souls were screaming inside them.  
A cold, viscous, blood-like liquid started to seep from the walls.  

The fish in the tank grew countless eyes and glared at Ben with malevolent intent.  
The toilet bowl opened its lid and screamed, *""Someone save me! I was meant to be a bathtub!""*  

Most terrifying of all, poor Ben watched as the sunflowers in his hand turned black, withered, and then burst into green, sulfurous flames.  

He screamed, threw the possessed bouquet to the ground, and fled as if he had seen the devil himself.  

After that, Clara locked herself away completely.  
She was convinced that *""my""* ghost was too jealous to allow any man near her.  

My love had become the most vicious curse, imprisoning her.  

---

And I, finally, understood.  
As long as I *""existed,""* she would never be free.  
I had to disappear completely.  

I returned to that gray, eternal office.  
This time, I found the right window, the one labeled *""Special Connection Request.""*  

The gray clerk was still there, still watching the clock that never moved, a game of Minesweeper on his computer screen.  

I submitted my request.  
He pulled a form from a pile of documents, titled *""Form 666B: Cross-Dimensional Sensory Connection Application (Final Destination Clause).""*  

""You know the price?"" he asked without looking up, continuing his game.  
""I do.""  
""It's irreversible. No refunds. Once you start, your 'existence' will melt like ice cream, you get it? Only not as sweet.""  
""I know.""  
""Alright then.""  

The game on his screen ended in failure.  
He finally looked up, his eye sockets completely empty.  

*""It's not my existence to waste, anyway. After all, 'existence' is just a subscription-based resource. You've simply chosen to settle your account early.""*  

I picked up the cold pen chained to the counter and signed my name.  

---

**It's okay. It's okay.**  

Clara was in a dream.  
She was back in our first home.  
The fire in the hearth crackled, but gave off no heat.  
The old jazz on the radio would occasionally stutter into a burst of harsh static.  

She was curled up in the rocking chair, a book on her lap, but the words on the page were subconsciously twisted by me, silently forming the lines *""Forget me, please.""*  

She sighed contentedly and murmured, *""Leo, if only you were still here.""*  

I walked out. Wearing her favorite blue sweater.  
*""My love.""*  

Her head snapped up, her eyes wide with shock, then flooded with ecstasy.  
I smiled and walked towards her, step by step, feeling parts of my very being flake away into invisible dust with each one.  

We talked for a long time.  
About all the little things her grief had buried.  
I tried my best to play the part of a perfect lover who had never left, but I knew my time was running out.  

My fingertips were already becoming transparent, like cheap glass.  

""Can I‚Ä¶ can I hug you?"" she finally asked, her voice trembling, afraid that the slightest breath would shatter this fragile dream.  
""Of course,"" I said.  

She wrapped her arms around my body.  

There was no warmth. No substance.  

Her fingers felt only a cold, dissipating void, like passing through a handful of dying embers.  
She could see me smiling, right there in front of her, but what she was touching was the real process of my *""dying completely""* for her.  

In her embrace, my blue sweater turned into a peeling, moribund constellation.  

She froze, finally understanding.  
""No‚Ä¶"" she tried to pull her hands back, but it was too late.  

I used my last moments of existence to give her one last surprise in the real world.  

*""Forget me,""* I whispered in her ear as I faded completely, *""and live well. This is... my final request.""*  

---

**I woke up.**  

The bedroom was quiet in the pre-dawn hours.  
Maybe it was just another dream.  
A dream too real, too cruel.  

I sat up, my heart a hollow ache.  
I saw something glowing on the nightstand.  

It was a small card.  
On it, a single line of text.  

*""Remember to live well.""*  

Tears streamed down my face, blurring the words.  
*""Your handwriting...""* I whispered, gently tracing the familiar, crooked letters with my fingertip.  
*""It's still so ugly.""*  

I clutched the card to my chest, feeling the last trace of a cold that didn't belong to this world.  
That cold was the last warmth he ever gave me.  

After a long time, I looked up, towards the breaking dawn outside my window.  
The sun was rising from the horizon, and for the first time, it shone into my room, and into my heart.

1o813hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o813hs/etiquettedress_code_in_shared_airbnb/,Etiquette/dress code in shared airbnb?,"I \[M27 Australia\] will be staying in an airbnb in a beach/coastal area next month in Australia. It's my first time renting an airbnb where the host is staying on-site - it's a 2 bedroom apartment, where he uses one room and I'll get the spare room.

Anyway - first time as an airbnb guest where the host will be staying on site. I wanted to ask what the etiquette is in shared spaces? His rules say it's a shared bathroom, no cooking in the kitchen but welcome to use it for tea/coffee. And I messaged him to check if I can have breakfast in the kitchen and he said that's fine and that ""it's a chill house"".

Specifically wondering:

* I wake up pretty early - if I'm up before my host is awake, should I be tiptoeing around if I need to use the kitchen/bathroom?
* Should I be like telling him when I'm leaving/when I'll be home? Assuming I'll have a key as normal.
* What's etiquette like for dress code in shared spaces? e.g. walking from the shower to my room, do I need to get fully dressed in the bathroom or can I just walk out in a towel to get to my room? Given it's a beach location, do I need to e.g. put on a shirt if I'm just chilling at home / if I just walk to the kitchen for a coffee, if it's hot or if I've just returned from the beach?",2,1760605021.0,Advice,3,1.0,False
1o811z1,https://i.redd.it/q96kf4q4ufvf1.jpeg,"Sharing OPSEC because a NGO demand it, is a big no go for me!","Volunteering for the military on the front line and enforcing strict OPSEC while also mediating with Western NGOs is a heavy and responsible task. Two years ago a representative of a well known NGO walked into my office. Because his organization had donated ‚Ç¨15,000 at the time, he openly asked where my drone teams operate and where the headquarters of the 1st Separate Nordic Tank Brigade is located. Both are obvious high value targets for the enemy. He announced his visit, which put everyone on high alert as we waited to see what would come from that conversation.

Military leadership later commended me for not disclosing any operational details. That stance led the foundation to stop providing further funds, but I will never trade OPSEC for money, regardless of the size of a donation. At no point will I share operational or location sensitive information. The NGO in question regularly cooperates with the Dutch press and, in my view, too often passes along sensitive information. That does not reflect well on them. Through their so called bureaucrat they continue to inappropriately request large amounts of OPSEC related information. It gives the impression this official is collecting brigade stamps. I will not yield to that.

What adds to my outrage is that the same man is now, two years after that office visit, trying to label me a fraudster. Immediately after his visit we accepted no further donations from that organization. Donations made to me are used exclusively inside the 25 kilometer zone in the southeast. I do not profit from this. I live for free, I have free internet and meals, and unlimited coffee and tea. In my 32 months of continuous front line service I have had only 24 hotel nights, and those were paid from sponsor funds.

That some NGOs habitually stay in relatively luxurious hotels in major cities only highlights their distance from the reality of the front line. From a comfortable office in Kyiv you can demand anything. On the front line everything is about survival. That is why I protect my OPSEC one hundred percent. I do it not for myself but to safeguard the recipients of donated goods and the people on the ground. I will never compromise that primary duty. Accusations and smears will not change my commitment or my principles.",1,1760604847.0,ukrainesoutheastfront,0,1.0,False

When the clock strikes this hour, they're both ready to party. We give them access to the entire flat, but why would they stay in the living room with all the toys when they could be wrestling eachother on our bed, attacking our feet, the usual...

Last night was probably the worst it's been. They'd discovered a game of going under the covers to give our toes a proper seeing to üòÇ 

Every time I got them out, they'd bounce back. To be honest, I think by doing this, I was just making the game more fun. 

To add, claws were out, but they caused 0 damage to us so I think they just want to play. Trouble is, I don't want to play at 3am if I can avoid it lol.

This morning, with a coffee in hand, I've had a look online and advice is pretty split:

1) Ignore, ignore, ignore. After a few weeks they should realise it doesn't get a reaction.
2) Give ""consequences"". I.e water spray bottle.

I'm not particularly keen on the second option. Our last cat was very chill and even as a kitten slept with us peacefully so this is new territory for us!

Hello. Owning a Magnifica Start for a bit more than a year. Breaks down every 2-3 months, usually some ground coffee that got stuck in / on its brewing unit. Usually can be fixed by taking the brewing unit out, giving it a rinse / removing stuck coffee ground with a cotton swab or toothpick and re-inserting it. I think this model has some design flaws with a) the way it tries to remove the ground coffee from the brewing unit and b) the way ground coffee gets deposited onto the brewing unit.

This time, its more stubborn. I took the brewing unit out, cleaned it all around, checked its two handles / cogwheel moves fine and reinserted it. Turn the machine on, try to make a coffee - red triangle, broken again. About 4 times of trying that by now, also cleaned the inside of the machine with a cloth.

I‚Äôm trying to decide between SSP MP and SSP HU burrs for my DF83. I‚Äôm using an HX E61 (quickmil andreja premium) for espresso and an Oxo Rapid Brewer (and really enjoying the clarity I get from this I have to say!), mostly working with light to medium roasts.

Most of my shots are for cappuccinos, and I been wanting to up my game for a while now and get higher clarity, and complexity.

I really want to feel flavor nuances better and get a value for my money and here‚Äôs my dilemma as far as I see the situation:

* MP: focus on clarity and separation, probably great for light roasts or Turbo-style shots. But I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll turn into a constant dialing/prep battle just to avoid thin, off-tasting shots. and I don't have a flow control espresso machine (for now ;) to fully leverage modern type of shots.
* HU: fuller, more traditional espresso body ‚Äî likely more balanced in milk. But I‚Äôm afraid it could make my shots less interesting or lively and be a disappointment comparing to spending 300$ on a set of burrs.

I‚Äôm not super experienced with TurboShots or SoupShots and in all the videos I saw i didn't notice a clear leaning towards a certain burr type, am I missing something?

Get your first cashout TODAY.,"I know, I know. Another survey app post. Trust me, I'm just as skeptical as you are. I've wasted hours clicking through garbage surveys only to get screened out at the last minute or hit with a minimum $25 payout threshold.

‚ÄãBut I finally found a game-changer that has quickly replaced all the others in my rotation: AttaPoll.

‚ÄãüöÄ Why AttaPoll Is Different (The Proof is in the Payout)
‚ÄãThe whole point of ""beer money"" is getting paid fast so you can actually enjoy it. AttaPoll is the only app I've used that genuinely delivers on this promise.

‚Äã‚ö°Ô∏è The Ultra-Low Payout Threshold: This is the MVP feature. You can cash out to PayPal or gift cards the moment you hit $3 USD / ¬£3 GBP. Seriously. You can often hit that target within your first hour of using it, especially if you complete the high-paying introductory surveys.

‚Äã‚è∞ Better Time Management: No more checking the app all day. AttaPoll is great at sending push notifications when a highly-rated, high-paying survey that matches your profile drops. You can do them on bathroom breaks or while waiting for coffee.

‚Äã‚≠êÔ∏è Reliable & Transparent: Each survey clearly shows you the reward amount, the estimated completion time, and a star rating (which usually indicates the success rate). You can filter out the junk and only click on the 4- and 5-star surveys.

‚Äãüí∞ Pro Tip for Max Earnings
‚ÄãWhen you first sign up, fill out ALL of the profile surveys first. These don't pay much, but they massively increase your matching rate for the high-value surveys that follow. A better match means less screening out!

I've had a great time playing Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days and it's been one of the few games that scratches a similar itch to State of Decay 2 (for me).

So far I've played through the game 3 times, the first time was on normal difficulty and I escaped the city on that save. The other 2 times were on the highest difficulty and while I didn't leave the city I did end up with a community of 10+ people that was effectively sustainable. This isn't meant as a brag or anything like that, it's just meant to provide context for my suggestions as I tend to prefer more difficult content.

Now to get into the meat and potatoes of my post;

**Here are the things I‚Äôd love to see in ‚ÄòInto the Dead: Our Darkest Days‚Äô:**

[These images are to break up the text so it isn't so painful to read :\)](https://preview.redd.it/3owncxuahfvf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92d6ba7fe2f52458d64083b0a5dc789edfa7df5e)

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

* **Multiple save slots. Three - five would be great (I think this has been confirmed by the Devs but I haven't kept up with all the announcements).**

[Something like this. Obviously this is SoD2 but a Into the Dead equivalent screen that displays similar stuff would be great.](https://preview.redd.it/lnzevubpifvf1.png?width=2559&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f18b6b8f317e0f87550fa677975b62599fc4af4)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* **New ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô zombie types**

**Spooks** \- Zombie‚Äôs that are smaller (maybe children) that run away from the player and wake up background zombies. They have a hard time opening doors but can, given enough time.

**Whisperers** \- Zombie‚Äôs that listen on the other side of doors. They would have a noticeable audio tell when close to a door and would be aggroed if the door is peeked through or opened. You can trigger them by throwing something at the door.

**Fakers** \- Background zombies that are actually conscious (similar to the zombies that pop out of underneath cars in some maps. These ones wouldn‚Äôt be fixed but would have a visual tell to make them noticeable without triggering them).

**Runners** \- Fast zombies, lootable on kill.

**Rotters** \- Zombies that emit a radius that causes damage after remaining in the radius for too long. I think it would be cool if these zombies could be killed in melee but only with weapons that have fast animations or if you knock them over with a brick first. Essentially they would be anti-stealth kill zombies unless you have fast animation weapons or bricks.

[Source: zombieless on DeviantArt || I can write half decent but I can't draw for shit. It's meant to show different neat types of zombies and doesn't necessarily correlate to my suggestions.](https://preview.redd.it/5lumj86kjfvf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bdb06cb03397d59e6c3ebf043c55bdded90a870)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* **More activities at home base**

In the mid to late game I‚Äôve found that I almost always have way more characters than I have activities to do. In order to combat this I think it would be good to introduce more ‚Äòresponsibility activities‚Äô.

1. Security Station (buildable station): A location that can be manned by a survivor to reduce barricade damage each cycle
2. Waste Disposal (default action): The larger your colony the more waste is generated each day. This waste needs to be disposed of or your colony will attract more zombies and have a higher potential of getting sick.
3. Location specific activities (aside from water making, gardening etc). For example it would be cool if Galaxy Zone Arcade had a single slot moral gain location that was more effective than the regular lounge, or maybe Texas Sport Supply has a slot that gives the character a chance to gain a temporary blunt damage boost etc.
4. Water and Garden stations should be buildable in any location but should be locked to those locations, making moving between shelters more desirable.

[I found this by googling 'chores are good for you'; It did not disappoint. The context is that chore activities in game can be good for progression and giving players ways to optimize \(and ways to increase difficulty\).](https://preview.redd.it/kd4v1v46kfvf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d01d2b5507182d1a75192584684d6b3c46aca5)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* **Vehicles and Gasoline**

Players should be able to find keys for randomly spawning vehicles on some of the higher difficulty maps. These vehicles could be used to extend the scavenging range of characters at the cost of gasoline and would also offer more storage for the maps you visit, but would cause an increase in the map threat level, and speed up the rate zombies build up at your base.

Vehicles could be used for ‚ÄòExpeditions‚Äô, single full day trips where instead of characters visiting just 1 location each in the daytime and nighttime, they instead visit 3 locations over the whole day one after another (incurring all the same benefits and penalties of using a vehicle).¬†

They would not be able to return to base or restock their supplies outside of what they brought with them or found in the maps, and their vehicle would provide the much needed extra storage. I also had the idea to have expeditions include 2 characters that you can actively switch between, kinda like the game ‚ÄòLakeview Cabin‚Äô (though that might not be feasible).

[Yall know where this is from right? I'm not getting old right? Context = vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jzz6lwcxkfvf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db7b8a2c55acd553b1297bb36f5db74823a2d210)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* **Mega Structures**

Large structures twice or even 3 times as large as the largest locations currently in the game. These would require both Day & Night to explore and would need a vehicle to visit (i.e. would be counted as an expedition in and of themselves). They could be things like a giant warehouse, an IKEA, a new block under development, or even a whole high rise. Massive, extremely dangerous, extremely lucrative locations that are the ‚Äòend game‚Äô of exploration; They could even tie some cool exit plans or final conclusions to them to give natural progression in their direction.

[It aint for everyone but 7 Days to Die has some cool mega structures and POIs with great level design if you don't completely ignore them by building a tower to the top using wood frames.](https://preview.redd.it/ijp9iheklfvf1.jpg?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80e7418ecbdb282e92d7fee52523bb4b6b16397b)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* **Backpacks, Item capacity, food & cooking**

This one I‚Äôm not super sure about but I thought I‚Äôd put it out there to see what other people think. More often then not, once I‚Äôve unlocked a level 2 cooking station, I just have my main cook (Daphne and/or Frank) spam cook Goulash with the occasional coffee mixed in, which can pretty much sustain a colony of any size (I‚Äôve got 10 people currently and am having literally 0 problems).. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to have more variation in meals to cook, with more incentive to work towards particular meals that could potentially offer buffs to your survivors?¬†

To do this, the developers would need to introduce more items to the game to expand the ‚Äòmenu‚Äô players can cook from, but this would cost players even more bag slots during their scavenging runs, so how do we combat this?

Right now I think inventory space is very limited, with the primary intention being to emphasize the importance of item prioritization. While I like this aspect of the game, I think there are ways it can be improved. For example, the developers could introduce different backpacks lootable in maps to increase carry slots as players progress through the game. This would allow players to naturally gather more loot from higher threat locations, as those places typically have more to offer, and you would have more space when you visit them.¬†¬†

[It's a cool backpack. Sometimes it doesn't need to be complicated. Image is from TruePrepper when I googled 'Zombie Survival Backpack'.](https://preview.redd.it/021k6x63qfvf1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2091c69728a727a64dd44dc3b295947e2dc69381)

1o80mxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1o80mxn/my_experience_with_jura_ena_4_and_why_i_switched/,My experience with Jura ENA 4 ‚Äî and why I switched to Breville (Sage) Barista Express Impress,"Sharing this in case it helps someone who‚Äôs thinking about getting a Jura or any other superautomatic. We learned the hard way what these machines are really like to own long term. I am not saying that I am against superautomatics, might even buy one again, but this is my experience.

We chose the Jura ENA 4 because of its reputation, design, and the promise of easy coffee at the push of a button. Two heavy coffee drinkers, 6‚Äì8 cups a day, always did every cleaning cycle exactly when the machine told us to, using Jura‚Äôs own tablets and filters.

After about a year we began having issues: blocked brew unit, inconsistent cup sizes, and a general feeling that the machine wasn‚Äôt working quite right. (There was even a part recall that had to be fixed by official service, which they did when we sent it for cleaning)

Around two years in, the coffee started to taste off. Slight moldy flavor. I opened the machine (which Jura makes unnecessarily difficult: you need a special oval tool) and found grime everywhere around the brew unit and greenish spots that looked like mold (this isn't as bad as the person who found a white worm in their Jura). The ‚Äúautomatic cleaning program‚Äù only touches the coffee flow path. Everything around it,the wet grounds, inner walls, tubing area , stays dirty and slowly builds up. And you can only run the cleaning program on this model when it asks you to - not when you want to.

I looked up what proper cleaning would cost. A full deep clean: ‚Ç¨300‚Äì400. Regular service that doesn‚Äôt include internal cleaning: ‚Ç¨140. On a machine that cost around ‚Ç¨600. And from online comments I understand that you‚Äôre supposed to do that yearly. It‚Äôs clear Jura‚Äôs business model depends on those service fees.

Superautomatics are convenient, but that convenience comes from having a lot of robotics and moving parts inside. They grind, tamp, brew, rinse, and dispose, all in a closed space you can‚Äôt reach. Unless the manufacturer lets you access and clean that space yourself, it feels like you‚Äôre basically renting the machine from their service department.

Some brands have   more user-friendly systems that you can open and clean properly at home. Unfortunately, Jura isn‚Äôt one of them. The machine is built to keep you out.

We decided not to spend more money on the ENA 4 and moved on. Yesterday we got the Sage Barista Express Impress (Breville model). Early impressions: solid build, good coffee, easy to clean, and I can see exactly what‚Äôs happening. It‚Äôs not as push-button simple as a superautomatic, but I feel more confident that the coffee is clean and fresh, and that I can maintain it myself to a degree.

If you‚Äôre thinking of buying a superautomatic, you should know what you‚Äôre getting into. The idea is great, and for some people the convenience is worth it, it was for us. But unless the machine allows full self-maintenance, you‚Äôll eventually face expensive servicing and internal grime you can‚Äôt reach.

And if you‚Äôre considering Jura specifically,  I‚Äôd recommend looking elsewhere. The design makes self-maintenance almost impossible, and the service costs quickly make it uneconomical.

Hopefully this helps someone avoid the same frustration we had. I still think there‚Äôs a market for truly user-maintainable superautomatics, I might even buy one again myself.

\*edit: I‚Äôm based in Finland, so there aren‚Äôt many options for servicing.

I play a D&D game in person with my friends, but I wanted to use Roll20‚Äôs dynamic lighting feature to make the maps feel way more immersive.

On Roll20, there‚Äôs this really cool feature called Dynamic Lighting, where you can place ‚Äúwalls‚Äù (basically colliders) on your map. When you add light sources, those walls block the light, creating realistic line of sight and glowing areas. I didn‚Äôt build that feature myself, (that‚Äôs just part of Roll20) but it‚Äôs usually meant for online play, not in-person sessions.

Since I run my game in person, I had to think outside the box. I made two separate accounts:

One account as the Dungeon Master so I can control and set everything up and see the entire map and control it.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Another account as a Player, which shows the map from the player‚Äôs perspective (so it only reveals areas they can ‚Äúsee‚Äù based on where the character is on the map).

I bought a pre-made map that already had the wall colliders set up (cause it was just easier) Then, I used OBS to capture the player view and stream it into Resolume. From there, I projected the output onto my coffee table.

Now, when my players tell me where they want to go, I can move the ‚Äúplayer‚Äù around the map, the light reacts in real time, creating this super cool, immersive experience. It honestly took me about 7 hours to figure everything out and troubleshoot it all, but it works and I‚Äôm stoked with how it turned out!!

The real game changer happens when you stop thinking ""integration"" and start thinking ""workflow engine."" It's not about data flowing between boxes; it's about mammogram reminders landing exactly when benefits reset, or AI fighting insurance denials while your coffee's still hot.

**Adoption follows convenience** ‚Äì when MultiCare synced Epic with patient engagement, they cut no-shows by 80%
