1ko1tth,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrobrandWatches/comments/1ko1tth/microbrands_design_validations/,Microbrands: Design Validations,"Hi Guys, really curious about the process Microbrand owners use to gauge interest in their designs, products and then refine them. It seems a difficult task getting feedback without revealing the designs. And revealing the design would be the ultimate challenge since, someone with more resources could copy the design and bring it to market. 

 also read somewhere that there were Microbrand owners asking for feedback after they started production, which was frowned upon. Are there any better processes ?

  
Why do i ask this ? I got into random talk with my friend over coffee, and went down the rabbit hole about doing our own designs and brand. Now, we have ideas which look good in our eyes, but we do want to validate before investing more time, energy and resources. 

Cheers

1ko1r5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalHealthFinds/comments/1ko1r5j/finally_found_something_that_helped_my_digestion/,Finally found something that helped my digestion after years of trial and error,"I‚Äôve been quietly battling digestive issues for years - bloating that came out of nowhere, constipation that would last for days, and that frustrating feeling of eating ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù but still feeling like something‚Äôs off. I‚Äôm not a doctor or a nutritionist, just someone who‚Äôs been through it all and tried more gut health products than I care to admit.

This year, I finally tried something that worked. Not instantly, not magically - but *genuinely* over time. And I wanted to share the experience because I know I‚Äôm not the only one googling things like ‚Äúhow to relieve bloating naturally‚Äù or ‚Äúis there anything better than probiotics?‚Äù

**What never worked for me**

Like most people, I started with probiotics. I went through a dozen brands, some refrigerated, some not. Some made my bloating worse. Others did nothing at all. I also tried fiber supplements, detox teas, and even low-FODMAP diets. They either didn‚Äôt help or weren‚Äôt sustainable.

I thought I was broken. Or that maybe this was just how my body worked now.

**What finally made a difference**

Then I came across a gut health supplement that works a bit differently. Instead of dumping more bacteria into your system like probiotics, this one focuses on **targeting methane-producing bacteria**, rebalancing your microbiome, and helping the gut lining heal.

Methane-producing bacteria slow down digestion and can be a major cause of gas and constipation. No one talks about this, but I started reading more and it made a lot of sense.

I decided to give it a shot, mostly because I had nothing to lose at that point. You can check out what I found [**here**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-er-vsl?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=16&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1040&guoid=1040&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds) if you‚Äôre curious.

**My experience over the first month**

* **First few days:** I noticed a difference in bloating pretty quickly. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much, but meals didn‚Äôt hit me the same way anymore.
* **Week 2:** I became more regular without needing coffee or fiber powders. It was the first time in years my digestion felt somewhat natural again.
* **Week 3‚Äì4:** Energy started creeping back in. I wasn‚Äôt exhausted after meals. I also noticed fewer sugar cravings, which I later read can actually be linked to gut imbalances.

None of this happened overnight, and there wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúmiracle moment‚Äù - but the changes were real. And steady.

**Is it safe long-term? Any side effects?**

That was my concern too. This supplement doesn‚Äôt use any harsh laxatives or artificial stuff. It‚Äôs plant-based, and the ingredients - like Berberine, Quercetin, and Resveratrol - are all things I‚Äôd seen recommended in other gut support articles.

I didn‚Äôt have any side effects. No cramping, no urgency, no weird flush. Just... stability. I felt like my body was doing what it was supposed to, finally.

If you're someone who keeps asking, *is it safe, is it FDA approved, is this another sketchy cleanse*, I totally get it. That‚Äôs what made me dig into how it works. The ingredient list and explanation are broken down [**here**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-er-adv-1?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=16&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1040&uid=2328&guoid=1040&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds) and that helped ease my mind.

**So who should try something like this?**

If you‚Äôre dealing with:

* Recurring bloating, especially after meals
* Constipation or sluggish digestion
* Gut issues that didn‚Äôt improve with probiotics
* A sense that your body just isn‚Äôt digesting food like it used to

Then yeah, it might be worth trying. It won‚Äôt fix everything in a day, but if your gut‚Äôs been out of balance for a while, this kind of reset could help.

**Final thoughts**

Gut health is frustrating. There‚Äôs so much info, and honestly, a lot of nonsense out there. What helped me wasn‚Äôt flashy. It wasn‚Äôt promoted by influencers. But it *did* make a difference in how I feel, eat, and move through the day.

If you‚Äôve tried all the usual stuff and feel like nothing‚Äôs working, don‚Äôt give up. Keep digging, stay curious, and maybe try something that works *with* your body instead of forcing it.

And if you‚Äôve found anything that helped you, please share it here. Real people‚Äôs stories are way more useful than any ad.",1,1747404451.0,NaturalHealthFinds,0,1.0,False

Thank you everyone üíì who spent time on this problem. I really appreciate the funny giggles. And I want to give credit to everyone who had a comment or opinion, especially u/Ds9niners and u/forestall.

This question comes from a job application. So because it's on the application, I immediately knew that the answer was not allowed to be $20. Instead, that would have immediately been incorrect (so I set $20 aside as y). Instead, I needed to focus on something else the cost of a tie with a difference of $80, the x created by the trick questio.

The reason why this is tricky is that 1) the cost of the tie is x and, 2) the difference between the cost of (shirt - tie = $80) plus the remainder must equal $100. The only way for the difference of this shirt and tie the equaling $80 is for the shirt to cost $90. It becomes a trick depending on how you look at it. Because that would a) mean that the tie costs $10. And, b) the difference between $100 and $90 is also $10. So, the employer wants to know whether you can recognize separate that confusing amount of $10 twice and hold them in two separate boxes. In the way that I learned math, we have an x and y problem. 

But the first problem is to find out what x is. And only then can you check using the $100 sum. It's the equivalent of solving the problem (x). And then checking (y). And what I got was x = y, both equal $10. 

So, I acknowledged that I cut her off, that her formula is correct, and then we had this conversation. I just would never have used the same variable while explaining it. Instead, Alia recognized that x = $10, and so used it twice. But that's pattern recognition. In her mind there is no difference. In my mind, there's a difference, because you're trying to figure out two different things; that's human intuition.

Note: Normally I would fix her makeup and such, but I still haven't started today. And it's a long post. I also see how it can be done this way, but it's not the way that I was taught math.

Now, when we‚Äôre literally a walking distance apart, our calendars are filled with ‚Äúsomedays‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybes‚Äù and ‚Äúone days‚Äù.

I guess six timezones is more motivating than a calendar full of blank spaces.

When she‚Äôd fly back home, and no matter where she‚Äôd rent her apartment in our hometown, I would make those spaces for her.

She‚Äôd do it, too.

We‚Äôd see each other on a regular basis during her few-month visits.

Coffee. Walks. Clubbing. Chilling in a park. Healthy food crawling. Strolling along the river. Getting tipsy at food festivals.

Honest talks on her couch. Ridiculous conversations on benches. Gossiping by the pool. Absurd debates when we‚Äôre about to say goodbye to each other on the street.

We had that kind of connection that feels rare, and so f‚Äôn easy at the same time.

Now?

She lives a thirty-minute walk away.

And if we see each other once a month, we call it a win!

No timezones.

No flights.

No clocks ticking.

Not limited by time.

Not limited by distance.

**Limited only by the illusion that we have forever.**

But we don‚Äôt.

She‚Äôs leaving again soon.

And this time for good.

Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable part: We still aren‚Äôt planning any get-togethers.

Not because I‚Äôm busy.

Not because she‚Äôs changed.

But because nothing is changing.

Because somewhere in our minds ‚Äî we still have time.

That lie is so easy to believe when someone is close by.

We treat nearness like permanence.

And permanence like a guarantee.

And when something is guaranteed, it can wait.

Until it is urgent.

Until there is no more time.

Until someone‚Äôs boarding a plane.

Only then does the urgency return.

And I‚Äôm not just taking her presence for granted.

I‚Äôm taking for granted my book, the one I truly believe in and have millions of reasons to finish. The one that just needs a little more courage‚Ä¶ A little more clarity‚Ä¶ A little more time‚Ä¶ (Remind me to write a piece about how having time is not an excuse for anything, for you always have time, you are just setting poor priorities.)

I‚Äôm taking for granted my drive of walking the Camino, an adventure so close to my heart that I already feel it pounding after a whole day of hiking. But first, I need to finish that first book. Because the second one is about the Camino itself. So I‚Äôm dragging my feet on both. What a perfect system‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm taking for granted my dream of volunteering at a dog shelter far away. I have no idea where, but see it so clearly‚Ä¶ and do nothing. Because ‚Äúmy pooch has a limited time here with me and I can‚Äôt leave him for other dogs‚Äù.

I‚Äôm taking for granted all the workbooks I‚Äôve already started. ‚ÄúI need a more stable income‚Äù, I keep telling myself ‚Äî not realizing that publishing the first one could be the very thing that creates it.

What am I waiting for?

**A notion that I will die soon, I guess.**

Because we always think we‚Äôll have time.

We believe we‚Äôll start when things are easier, clearer or more stable.

But easiness, clarity and stability don‚Äôt come from being passive.

It comes from actively showing up ‚Äî before we become forced to.

Before the opportunity expires.

Before I dive into the meat of it, let me give you some context‚Ä¶

About a year ago, I was stuck in a rut juggling freelance gigs, burnt out from client work, and constantly broke. I was living off coffee, ramen, and Reddit rabbit holes, desperately looking for a way to build something scalable without a huge upfront investment.

I‚Äôd always been curious about AI. One night, while messing around with ElevenLabs and some open-source TTS models, I had a stupid idea: ‚ÄúWhat if I could clone a voice and script some spicy audio content for fun?‚Äù

It was half a joke ‚Äî until I realized there‚Äôs a whole underground economy of people paying real money for personalized NSFW audio.

So I went full goblin mode on research.


Step 1: Researching the NSFW Audio Market

First, I spent a week just lurking and listening:
	
‚Ä¢	Subreddits like r/GoneWildAudio, r/NSFWAudio, r/EroticaGuild
	
‚Ä¢	Fan platforms like Fansly and Patreon
	
‚Ä¢	Gumroad stores of audio creators
	
‚Ä¢	Even Discord servers dedicated to audio roleplay

I noticed three huge things:
	
1.	Personalization sells ‚Äî People love content that feels custom-made for them.
	
2.	Women dominate the space, but there‚Äôs growing demand for male/femboy/androgynous voices too.
	
3.	Most creators record everything manually ‚Äî AI could cut production time by 80%.

That was my lightbulb moment.


Step 2: Picking the Right Tools

I tested at least 10 different TTS tools and voice AI platforms. Here‚Äôs what I landed on:
	
‚Ä¢	ElevenLabs: Hands-down the best for natural-sounding voices. I cloned 2 voices (one sultry, one soft dom) using 5-minute clean voice samples.
	
‚Ä¢	TTS alternatives: XTTS from Coqui, Bark (okay quality), and OpenVoice (more customizable).
	
‚Ä¢	Scriptwriting: GPT-4 (yep, this bad boy). I built a prompt library for different kinks, accents, character types, etc.
	
‚Ä¢	Editing: Audacity + free plugins (reverb, EQ, background ambience).
	
‚Ä¢	Automation: Python scripts to batch-generate audios + Canva templates for cover art.


The first 20 audios were clunky. Mispronunciations, pacing issues, audio artifacts‚Ä¶ But I iterated. Fast.


Step 3: Building the Production & Delivery System

Once I had a system down, I structured everything like a mini production studio:
	
‚Ä¢	Google Sheets to track requests, delivery dates, tags/kinks, and customer preferences.
	
‚Ä¢	Notion database of scripts, prompt templates, and voice notes.
	
‚Ä¢	Gumroad as the storefront for pre-made audios + private delivery of customs.
	
‚Ä¢	Telegram bot for quick customer communication + sending download links.
	
‚Ä¢	Zapier to connect purchase > audio delivery > email collection.

It sounds complicated but once it was built, I could take a custom request at 2 AM and have it auto-fulfilled in 15 mins with minimal touch.


Step 4: Finding Clients and Making Sales

This was the trickiest part. Here‚Äôs what worked (and what didn‚Äôt):

What didn‚Äôt work:
	
‚Ä¢	Running ads (platforms block NSFW content fast)
	
‚Ä¢	Posting in big subs (usually against rules)
	
‚Ä¢	Cold DMs (don‚Äôt be that person)

What actually worked:
	
‚Ä¢	Posting samples on alt Reddit accounts with links to my Gumroad
	
‚Ä¢	Offering ‚ÄúPay what you want‚Äù customs early on to build testimonials
	
‚Ä¢	Creating ‚Äúniche packs‚Äù like F4M vampire audio series, femboy cuddles, or JOI scripts
	
‚Ä¢	Partnering with NSFW writers to turn their stories into audio collabs
	
‚Ä¢	Building a tiny email list of repeat buyers with a ‚ÄúWhat kink should I do next?‚Äù poll

Within 2 months I had my first $100 week. Then $400. Then a $900 month with less than 10 hours of work.


Turning It Passive (While I Sleep, Literally)

The game-changer was batch-creating content packs:
	
‚Ä¢	‚Äú10 F4M audios for submissive guys‚Äù
	
‚Ä¢	‚Äú7-day girlfriend experience audio journey‚Äù
	
‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCursed AI audio with glitchy horror erotica‚Äù

These sold over and over again on Gumroad and Fanhouse.

Then I set up a mini Patreon clone with a monthly drop of new customs, access to voting polls, and behind-the-scenes prompts. 10 loyal subs at $10/month?


Obstacles, Fails & Lessons
	
‚Ä¢	Voice cloning isn‚Äôt perfect: You need clean data. Don‚Äôt clone without consent.
	
‚Ä¢	NSFW content toes legal/ethical lines: Avoid real people‚Äôs voices or anything remotely illegal.
	
‚Ä¢	AI can‚Äôt fully replace real emotion: But you can mask that with sound effects, music, and smart pacing.
	
‚Ä¢	Trust is huge: Use alt accounts but stay consistent. Be respectful. Don‚Äôt ghost clients.


TL;DR: What Worked
	
‚Ä¢	Solving for scale: AI lets you do what others can‚Äôt ‚Äî fast, custom, repeatable.
	
‚Ä¢	Being niche AF: Don‚Äôt try to please everyone. Pick a kink or character type and go deep.
	
‚Ä¢	Creating systems: Front-load the work so it becomes passive.
	
‚Ä¢	Staying anonymous but human: Use a persona, build a brand, and offer insane value.

It‚Äôs weird. It‚Äôs niche. But damn, it works.

Now, when we‚Äôre literally a walking distance apart, our calendars are filled with ‚Äúsomedays‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybes‚Äù and ‚Äúone days‚Äù.

I guess six timezones is more motivating than a calendar full of blank spaces.

When she‚Äôd fly back home, and no matter where she‚Äôd rent her apartment in our hometown, I would make those spaces for her.

She‚Äôd do it, too.

We‚Äôd see each other on a regular basis during her few-month visits.

Coffee. Walks. Clubbing. Chilling in a park. Healthy food crawling. Strolling along the river. Getting tipsy at food festivals.

Honest talks on her couch. Ridiculous conversations on benches. Gossiping by the pool. Absurd debates when we‚Äôre about to say goodbye to each other on the street.

We had that kind of connection that feels rare, and so f‚Äôn easy at the same time.

Now?

She lives a thirty-minute walk away.

And if we see each other once a month, we call it a win!

No timezones.

No flights.

No clocks ticking.

Not limited by time.

Not limited by distance.

**Limited only by the illusion that we have forever.**

But we don‚Äôt.

She‚Äôs leaving again soon.

And this time for good.

Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable part: We still aren‚Äôt planning any get-togethers.

Not because I‚Äôm busy.

Not because she‚Äôs changed.

But because nothing is changing.

Because somewhere in our minds ‚Äî we still have time.

That lie is so easy to believe when someone is close by.

We treat nearness like permanence.

And permanence like a guarantee.

And when something is guaranteed, it can wait.

Until it is urgent.

Until there is no more time.

Until someone‚Äôs boarding a plane.

Only then does the urgency return.

And I‚Äôm not just taking her presence for granted.

I‚Äôm taking for granted my book, the one I truly believe in and have millions of reasons to finish. The one that just needs a little more courage‚Ä¶ A little more clarity‚Ä¶ A little more time‚Ä¶ (Remind me to write a piece about how having time is not an excuse for anything, for you always have time, you are just setting poor priorities.)

I‚Äôm taking for granted my drive of walking the Camino, an adventure so close to my heart that I already feel it pounding after a whole day of hiking. But first, I need to finish that first book. Because the second one is about the Camino itself. So I‚Äôm dragging my feet on both. What a perfect system‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm taking for granted my dream of volunteering at a dog shelter far away. I have no idea where, but see it so clearly‚Ä¶ and do nothing. Because ‚Äúmy pooch has a limited time here with me and I can‚Äôt leave him for other dogs‚Äù.

I‚Äôm taking for granted all the workbooks I‚Äôve already started. ‚ÄúI need a more stable income‚Äù, I keep telling myself ‚Äî not realizing that publishing the first one could be the very thing that creates it.

What am I waiting for?

**A notion that I will die soon, I guess.**

Because we always think we‚Äôll have time.

We believe we‚Äôll start when things are easier, clearer or more stable.

But easiness, clarity and stability don‚Äôt come from being passive.

It comes from actively showing up ‚Äî before we become forced to.

Before the opportunity expires.

She‚Äôs still here.

And so am I.

What a waste if I didn‚Äôt call her.

Because we certainly don‚Äôt get to choose how much time we have ‚Äî but we do get to choose how we‚Äôll use it.",2,1747403729.0,self,1,1.0,False

And here‚Äôs my rant: a colleague of mine with ADHD complained about the same. That she struggled to find her stimulants in pharmacies. And then she said how she ¬´really needs them¬ª because she likes feeling more productive at work and she needs less coffee (‚Ä¶‚Ä¶) I tried making conversation about this as I don‚Äôt have that many around me with ADHD and asked about what other issues we both really struggled with without the stimulants and she shrugged and said ¬´that‚Äôs it.¬ª 

I have absolutely no right to question other peoples diagnoses or health, but I felt so awfully pissed off at this. If she would only know how some of us literally depend on our medications to LIVE. My life without medication is a hellscape of emotional dysregulation, intrusive thoughts, constant restlessness, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. 

The fact that it seems to be some sort of a thing now a days to go to a private practitioner and more or less *demand* a ADHD diagnosis because they‚Äôve seen something on Tiktok is really a problem. I wouldn‚Äôt really give a shit if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that these people contribute to the medication shortage that us with quite serious disability NEED.

**Emma** *(white cake layered with strawberry jam and juicy fresh strawberries and whipped cream)* Scarlet seeds caught between perfect teeth; bloody berry stains bleeding through white cloth napkins, cake layers light as tissue paper; rouged lips brushing bone china; crumbs scattered across tatted lace.

**Juliet** (*cardamom pistachio olive oil cake with lemon vanilla glaze)* Cool, piney cardamom pods drowning in honey, an amber jar hurled and shattered across old ceramic tiles in a fit of pique, golden liquid pooling languorously in afternoon light; bitter tree nuts cracking between strong deft fingers, shells scattered underfoot, too warm and drowsy to care, mahogany armoires and sandalwood chests exhaling their precious oils into scorching rooms, siesta stretching endlessly beneath shuttered windows, a surrender to the shadow of the sun stretching across weathered terracotta walls.

**Mathilda** *(fudgy chocolate cake with milk chocolate frosting, coffee, royal sandalwood, amber****)*** Fudgy coffee thick and dark; sandalwood incense drifting from small altars, a dusting of dark, aromatic grounds offered up as prayer, the sharp and bitter and sweet and unctuous drawing richer smoke from burning wood. Private, intensely personal ritual, the intimacy of small devotions.

**Scout** *(white cake layered with candied cherries and caramelized coconut pecan frosting, and soaked in bourbon)* Perfume as lesbian pulp fiction blurb: Sharon was a good girl who loved innocent coconut cake... until she met Veronica and her jar of sinful candied cherries! What happens when the innocence of this sugar-sweet babe meets those luscious cherry-red lips? One taste of those artificially brightened fruits and Sharon discovers hungers she never knew existed. Will she return to her vanilla world of church socials and proper ladies... or surrender to the sticky-sweet decadence that Veronica's red fingernails promise? A torrid tale of confectionery corruption and the dangerous women who seduce with sugar!

Adhesive: Just powder is working the best for me in terms of removal, it kinda balls itself up and I can pick it out whereas the paste just smears and coats my dentures and mouth in a film that is hydrophobic and makes it hard to add the powder. It doesn't have great hold, yesterday I had a hot coffee and it completely washed away the adhesive under my lowers, I can really only eat one meal or snack before it becomes weak and less reliable, so I tend to go a little hungry and be picky and choosy about what I eat with them. I know if I have a snack of cheezits at 3 I'm probably having a cheeseburger without my teeth for dinner.

Food: I can eat SO MUCH MORE NOW! I've even had a sub from subway! Crunchy (NOT HARD) does better than soft for sure, and foods that do really well without teeth do pretty poorly with teeth lol! Cheeseburger? The bun and cheese are glue. Cake? The frosting is like cement liquids do fine but my lower isn't quite flush to my gums in the front so it usually washes adhesive away. My biggest tip if you're trying new things with your teeth once eating becomes a little more reliable, go to a buffet so you can try a bite or two of a wide variety as opposed to risking it on something new. 

Life: I got my old job back! The job I was laid off from at the beginning of last year before I was even considering dentures! I did let management (new and old) know whats going on and what my next steps are, nothing but support and they're gonna help me keep it quiet next week when I'm masked up and toothless.

Next steps: I got my dentures through Renew Smiles, they are implant supported with snaps. On Monday I go back to have the snaps installed onto my implants (bottoms only), impressions will be done, my teeth will be taken away and sent back to the labs for a week so they can install the hard permanent liner, they'll be reshaped a bit in the gums, and then I'll be able to snap my bottoms in and I'm hoping my uppers will feel a little more supported because I can definitely feel the give of my soft liner. I assume we willalso be talking about whether I'm eligible for upper implants that I will wait until August for because my out of state bestie is coming for a visit and I don't want to be healing and unable to eat AGAIN.

I figured this sort of newsletter style might be suitable instead of multiple mini updates in a short period of time. :)  Sorry if it is a lengthy read! I tried to keep everything relatively concise. But on with the updates, starting with the most exciting:

**New Fragrance Collection - Venture Forth!**  
  
Released on 1 May, 2025, the Venture Forth collection is now available for purchase as full sizes and as a part of our Choose Your Own Sampler.  There are 15 new scents in the collection, and all are inspired by original characters of mine and my friends' from D&D parties current and past. It's a bit of a love letter to my friends and their creativity, and the scents are inspired by their descriptions of what their characters would smell like - along with some creative license to turn the descriptions into uniquely Crow & Pebble fragrances. And of course, the collection was rounded out with a few of my own D&D Characters - because who wouldn't be tempted to design their own creation's signature scent?! ;) 

These new fragrances will be available outside of the seasonal rotation catalogues for the time being; when a new perfume collection is released, they will be split up and added to the various seasons or core catalogue as best suits them. Until then, they will be available year-round as if they were a part of the core collection. So there will be lots of time to try them at your own pace. 

The new scents and their descriptions are as follows, in alphabetical order: 

* **A Scamp's Stolen Heart:** Dark red roses dripping blood from their thorns, cumin, bergamot, black musk and soft earth.
* **Bonne Vivante:** A heart of heady gardenia and tuberose is supported by a base of creamy sandalwood and clean white musk and topped with a bubbly splash of champagne and a generous pinch of pink pepper.
* **Courting Danger:** Fragrant boronia blossoms and juicy apricots and sweet clementine paired with lightly toasted marshmallow, black pepper and a hint of smoke.
* **Devil's Trifle:** Chocolate dipped pineapple, passionfruit curd and juicy pink grapefruit topped with cardamom on a base of dark vanilla.
* **Fault in Crystal:** Violet, lavender, green mandarin and dragonsblood incense combine as a soft floral contrast to the scent of a violent storm: wet stone, ozone and petrichor.
* **Fettered Raven:** A tumbler of whisky dusted with white pepper, lit beeswax candles and ancient parchment scrolls spread across a polished wood desk.
* **Glimmer and Blossom:** A garland of gorse, acacia and daffodil, golden amber, wildflower honey and tangy red mandarin.
* **Heartmender:** A pearly blend of white flowers, golden honey and tobacco, enlivened with white and mountain peppers and grounded in earthy oakmoss.
* **Lady Palimpsest:** A heart of powdery soft wisteria and pink roses, topped with bergamot and clary sage on a base of ambergis.
* **Lament of the Mystic:** A censer of sacred resins and blackened vanilla and a a cup of tea leaves lie abandoned amongst bundles of clary sage and tobacco leaves in a hut overgrown with ripe fox grapes and moonflower.
* **Lovelorn Legionnaire:** Fresh water flowing in banks of oakmoss, dotted with blooming waterlilies and fringed by maritime pine and rosewood trees, all on an ambergris base.
* **Mother Dusk:** A steaming mug of coffee, coriander seed and a cozy wool sweater, sheltered by pine and fir trees while the gloom of night is kept at bay with bursts of sweet orange.
* **Quixotic Adept:** Caramelized pears and candied nuts dusted with cinnamon and cardamom and sprinkled with orange blossom water.
* **Seven:** Delicate muguet and cucumber, rain clouds, liturgical incense and white grapefruit on a base of leather and black musk.
* **Vestige of Yearning:** A hot cup of earl grey tea enjoyed among blooming irises and lavender, the scents of freshly turned earth and church incense wafting through the air.

I hope you're as excited about these new offerings as I am. They were a blast to make and a real challenge working to some of the briefs and themes I discussed with the characters' creators!

**Spring to Summer Catalogue Rotation**

On 1 June, 2025 at midnight UK Time, our Spring Catalogue of scents will rotate OUT of stock and the Summer Catalogue will rotate IN to stock.

When the Spring Catalogue rotates out, the Summer one will rotate in. Our Summer scents will be made available for purchase as full sizes and as a part of our Discovery Flights.

If you want to jump the gun a bit and add Summer scents to a Discovery Flight early, please feel free, but be aware that they will not begin processing until the rotation has happened, and our 14 working day turnaround time won't begin on that order until that date. Thanks!

**Other things**

As many of you may be aware, the Royal Mail has changed a few prices, which has made First Class Mail for our UK customers more expensive than the Tracked options, therefore I have removed it as a shipping option as it became a much lower value for the price. To make the transition easier, I have lowered the price of the Tracked48 shipping option for the time being.   I have also raised the free shipping threshold for UK orders to ¬£35 in order to accommodate the increase in shipping costs.  As of right now, our shipping costs have not changed for international customers, so no changes have been made to our shipping price structure for orders to locations outside of the UK.

For our US customers, as far as I know, the $800 de minimis for personal imports is still in place for mail from the UK. This means that you shouldn't be charged duties or tariffs on items below that amount from us; however, I cannot predict whether or not customs charges might be applied anyway or whether this situation will change in the near future. Just know that you will not be charged extra by Crow & Pebble at the time of purchase for your items or for shipping, but I can't make any guarantees otherwise. 

For everyone: Our materials costs are not directly affected, at this point in time, by any tariffs applied in the USA, so we will not be increasing our prices at this current junction. For everyone located outside of the US and UK, everything should remain the same as it has for some time with Crow & Pebble! I have decided to hold off for the time being on raising prices in line with inflation until there is a little less economic uncertainty the world over. Unless there are some major changes to our costs in the next few months, we will reassess toward the end of this year whether or not to raise prices. 

Thank you all for your time and support! if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to leave a comment and I will try my best to get back to you as soon as I can.  :) Or drop me an e-mail if you have a more complex query that needs some attention.  Cheers!

1ko11a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Low-Couple-9242/comments/1ko11a8/my_review_of_fellow_gen_2_ode_after_upgrading/,My review of Fellow Gen 2 Ode after upgrading from Gen 1,"I've been using the Gen 1 grinder daily for a long time, mainly for drip, pour-over, and French press. It was a great grinder that really got the job done, but there were definitely a few quirks over time. Static was annoying without RDT, the hopper sometimes struggled with larger beans, and the original burrs felt a little average. Still, it was a solid companion for everyday coffee brewing.

Here's the link for the gen 2 if anyone's interested: [https://www.amazon.com/Fellow-Gen-Ode-Brew-Grinder/dp/B0BLRMCM9Y/](https://www.amazon.com/Fellow-Gen-Ode-Brew-Grinder/dp/B0BLRMCM9Y?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=trs-d-20&linkId=f1cd5a714a566223750a1be263a81da4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

Upgrading to the Gen 2 felt like a natural step, and so far, I‚Äôve been really happy with it. The new hopper design fixes the bean-jamming issue completely, and the slightly larger size has actually come in handy when I‚Äôm making coffee for guests. The new anti-static improvements are a huge win, no more mess, no zap, no retention. It makes the whole process feel cleaner and smoother.

The Gen 2 burrs are also a nice step up. I'm no expert, but I can definitely tell the grinds look more uniform, and my lighter and medium roasts have been tasting clearer and a bit sweeter. The grind sound is still pleasant, maybe a touch more metallic, but it‚Äôs not distracting. The new knock lever sounds better too, less clangy, kind of satisfying, honestly.

Overall, the Gen 2 feels like a well-rounded upgrade. If you're the only one using your Gen 1 and don‚Äôt mind RDT, you could just swap in the new burrs. But if other people use it or you‚Äôre tired of static and the occasional bean jam, the full upgrade is worth it. It‚Äôs made my coffee routine more enjoyable and hassle-free.",1,1747402584.0,u_Low-Couple-9242,0,1.0,False

Ever since I was a kid I always felt like I was a mistake that I don‚Äôt belong on this earth. I was an accident, everyday was a fucking struggle to get up and do anything. I‚Äôd get up to go to school because I had to, I got up to go to events that I didn‚Äôt wanna go to because I had to support my siblings in sporting events that didn‚Äôt care about.

I got up to get a job after highschool because I had to make money for my own stuff, I got up to get an education in college and I got up to try and pick a career because I had to. Nothing I did in my life was my decision half the damn time, ‚ÄúYou can be anything you wanna be and I‚Äôll support you.‚Äù My mom would say then make a face when I chose an art career.

Went so a summer program in Georgia at their art college, to experience animation and comic book design, was several out classed by most of my peer and was even told. ‚ÄúThis might not be the career for you.‚Äù Then when I got severally depressed, the counselors that were running program would ask why I wasn‚Äôt motivated to be there.

Then later on I tried different fields only to fall short yet again, now I work as a barista in a Target Starbucks, I only had one real relationship because I was a loser in highschool and still one now, the person I was with nearly cost me everything because of their drug obsession. After that it‚Äôs only been crazy people obsessed with me or younger people.

I feel like I‚Äôm trapped in a nightmare of failures and I keep hearing that awful voice in my head and often repeat it aloud to myself. ‚ÄúI hate you, no one loved you not even your mother, you just died back in highschool because you were a mistake.‚Äù However I kept going because I was forced to stay alive, now life feels like an obligation to keep leaving. That I have people who need me, including my friends. Even when all I wanna do is crawl in a hole and die. I even drove out to where there is a bridge honestly thinking about jumping. 

But my gut told me to stay because I have to many responsibilities to die now instead of you have so much to give in life. I live because I have to now instead of I want to‚Ä¶.. So I‚Äôm done now‚Ä¶.. I can‚Äôt keep up the responsibilities, I can‚Äôt keep hoping my career will take off because it‚Äôs dying because of AI generation, and I can‚Äôt keep finding excuses to keep living. I‚Äôve hated people my whole life and I hate being around them every day putting on a fake smile as I serve them subpar coffee.

I can‚Äôt keep this up and I can‚Äôt keep being a burden to those who have done nothing but bail me out of situations. It cost money to live and I‚Äôm about to be out of it soon. So fuck it‚Ä¶.",2,1747402340.0,SuicideWatch,1,1.0,False

Then everything went black.

I woke up in an empty room, there was a single bulb hanging from the ceiling. A small set of stairs that led up to a metal door. I wasn‚Äôt bound or anything, but I was on the floor. I got up as the door opened and two men walked in. They were dressed in immaculate suits. I was confused, but then they started beating me up. I didn‚Äôt know what was going on but then they explained they were angels and I had something they needed. And they were going to make me tell them where it was. 

That‚Äôs when I decided enough was enough and fought back. It was surprisingly easy? But when I knocked one out the other unfurled his wings. I managed to overpower him too and grabbed his wings and ripped them off before running out the door. 

Then I found myself in a cave system. As I started making my way out, I found a man that was dying. He begged me to take him to the surface so that his soul could ride the wind to the afterlife.

What to do next?!,"A bit of context on my situation: I'm a recent graduate who, about five months ago, came across a post from a serial founder building a new project. He mentioned he was looking for new team members, so I reached out asking for more information‚Äîand after rounds of interviews and eagerness from my end, he offered me a role. Although he couldn‚Äôt commit to a full-time position, he brought me on in a contractual Founder Associate role.

In the meantime I was applying elsewhere and landed a full-time role at a more stable startup about a month later, also in a GTM/Founder Associate position. I was upfront with the first founder about this and let him know about this. At the time he was thinking of pausing the contract till I was more available but saw benefits in having me onboard in the meantime to help validate the ideas we were having. 

Both roles have been going well. At the contractual role, we've gone through several rounds of idea validation and pivoted away from the original concept, which has made the work dynamic and interesting. Meanwhile, I‚Äôve also been growing my skills in the full-time position, although I find it less exciting due to the product focus and internal team dynamics (we‚Äôre a very small team of four). The contractual role is even smaller (just me and the founder), but the vision is more aligned with my interests, especially since it's AI-focused. Both startups have similar levels of commitment from their founders.

After a week of radio silence, the founder of the contractual role reached out to say we should have a catch-up call. In that conversation, he first asked about my experience in the full-time role, then suggested we pause the contractual Founder Associate role for now. He said he‚Äôd like to stay in touch and mentioned he‚Äôs still open to catching up over coffee if I‚Äôm nearby. In the past, he‚Äôs mentioned a potential future role for me (something GTM-related or in product marketing).

I‚Äôm genuinely very interested in the contractual project‚Äîif it were less risky, I‚Äôd likely choose it over the full-time job. I‚Äôm wondering how best to maintain the relationship going forward. I have some time next week and was considering popping by the office to say hello. Any other Advice? Finding it hard to tell if the founder for the contractual job really wanted to work with me as he would have offered a full time role at this point.

I'm somewhat confident that the cartoon characters were Disney - Mickey Mouse, Minnie, Donald Duck, and Goofy I believe. And it was about dinosaurs.

There is a certain aspect of this poster that grabbed me, made me reflect on my life, my failed attempts at so very many things. I write that, not even with a hint of self-pity or regret, acknowledging that I sit here, enjoying my cup of coffee, sitting on my well worn couch, infront of the large window of the home I live in, overlooking the front yard and paved street of the neighborhood I reside in, with all my digits, and general health, and just enough aches to remind me I am alive, while listening to a 250lb dog snore beside me. So yes, I make mistakes daily, hourly if I am being totally honest. Yes, I have fallen flat on my face or ass, depending on which visual you prefer, with so many different situations I attempted. Business, personal, health wise, and financial, all covered! All of them stacked on top of each other, adding to the layers of knowledge and experience, from life's lesson book. There is not a single individual that ever existed who could print the letters of their alphabet first try, walk across the room as a toddler, on the first attempt, or do simple math's, the same day as the lesson.

I am not clear exactly how you may interpret trust the process because I am not sure myself what that may mean, but I am confident in stating that every single instance which you did not succeed is a chance to learn, to refine and grow. How we choose to view those moments is probably as important as the correction we are guided towards. Abject disappointment, disheartened motivation, or humiliating embarrassment are absolutely survivable and, more importantly, just a facet of your stinkin thinking mind to prompt you to quit. That is genetically not our way, you did not quit as the mighty swimmer of conception, and you haven't quit on breathing in and out consecutively, from the moment of your birth, even though growth has been wrought with pain and scrapes. Keep on keeping on and adding to your LIBRARY of experiences. It is, after all, what our time in this fleshsuit is all about, right?

As of today my A1C is at 5.3 which makes me extremely proud!

I immediately got a CGM after my last results came in and I still have one on right now which has helped me tremendously in this journey of understanding how my body reacts to certain foods. I will still use a CGM occasionally from now on, but it's just a lot of money so I will only get it every few months now and I will continue what I have been doing.

I've been a silent lurker here since then but I want to share what I think has contributed to my success in hopes that it could help you guys get some inspiration:

\- Exercise: Back in December I got myself a walking pad and I think this was the biggest contributor. I had already changed my diet prior to that and included a lot more vegetables but I was lacking in regular exercise. I now walk anywhere between 2-3 miles every day. Rarely do I go a day without walking at all. I mostly walk after dinner because that's when I actually have time. I do try to go for a post lunch walk at work for 20-30 minutes. On days when it was super cold I really had to push myself to do it but I always feel better after I go out and get fresh air.

\- Stress Levels: Back in 2024 my husband and I bought a house and that was one of the most, if not THE most, stressful time of my life and I think this had a lot to do with my higher levels last year. 

\- Sleep: I strive to go for minimum 8 hours. If I can get 9, even better. Yeah that's not always super realistic but I always needed a ton of sleep to not feel like a zombie.

\- Food: What everybody tells you: I started introducing a lot more vegetables into my diet and cut out my little sweet treat I would often have for lunch or dinner. If I really feel like I want something sweeter now, I am opting for a small piece of dark chocolate or an almond butter cup from the brand unreal, they make some really tasty treats with a lot less sugar. But I still keep that to a minimum. I occasionally share a can of poppi with my husband for dinner. Other than that I only drink water and only have one coffee in the morning with 2% milk and an occasional splash of Torani sugar free caramel or vanilla syrup.

In the last 6 months I went to get fast food (Burger, Fries, Diet Soda) maybe 3-4 times and instead of going out to dinner 1-2 times a week for dinner, we cut that down to ZERO. I used to have sushi for lunch every single week (sometimes twice a week) and cut that out completely when I saw how much it spiked me. I am such a sushi lover and that was a hard one. I still have sushi on occasion though and then only with tons of edamame and a salad beforehand.

When I do eat carbs (let's say pasta, bread, rice, or potatoes), I see a dramatic difference in my blood sugar when I eat a salad beforehand vs when I don't.

As far as drinking alcohol goes, I occasionally have one small glass of wine on Fridays and Saturdays after a full meal and I always pair it with popcorn, almond crackers and brie. I used to drink wine every weekend.

I tried to do Keto but then got scared about my cholesterol going up so I just focused on being low carb overall.

What also contributed to high blood sugar for me is when I ate food too fast. Sometimes I had to scarf down lunch in between meetings and it would be the exact same food but my blood sugar would go up vs when I took my time. And another big thing is of course portion control. I sometimes wouldn't even realize how much I was eating when I was watching TV while having dinner but now I am super mindful of my portions.

A typical day of meals for me looks like this:

**Breakfast**

About a cup of nonfat Greek Joghurt with blueberries or strawberries (a few times a week I mix half a tablespoon of chia seeds in), about 1/4 cup of 2% Cottage cheese, a handful of pistachios and 2 egg-omelet with spinach and feta (during the week I use egg whites and on the weekend I use regular eggs, again, I was scared about my cholesterol).

**Lunch** (looks pretty much the same every single day):

Mixed raw veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, carrots) with hummus, a few slices of turkey deli meat, cheese stick, a few almond flour crackers with guacamole or I'll have an avocado toast with salmon and raw vegetables on the side.

  
**Snack:** I opt for a banana or berries with almond butter and also have a protein bar from the brand aloha, the maple and chocolate mint one taste so so good and rarely spike me. I sometimes would have the protein bar with my lunch if I am really hungry then.

**Dinner** (also looks pretty much the same every day):

Baked chicken or Salmon with either baked or raw vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, carrots) and caesar salad (minus croutons) or just a big salad with chicken or salmon

When we do go out to dinner on occasion now I always get a salmon entree or caesar salad.",12,1747402029.0,prediabetes,5,1.0,False

1ko0sit,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1ko0sit/quick_question_for_my_fellow_hospitality_workers/,Quick question for my fellow hospitality workers,"Hi y'all, I know this doesn't really fall under what this subreddit is for but I need some outside help 

I work at a big name hotel with 130 rooms as a second shifter. When I started 1.5 years ago, we ALWAYS had two people on the desk on my shift, even when we only had 20 check ins for the night. This year something happened with budget cuts and we had to cut a lot of our employees hours, which meant cutting us down to one front desk agent per shift no matter how busy it is. 

Long story short I've been working sold out/close to selling out weekends by myself (with a manager in their office until about 7 pm in case I ""need help"" which I need help all night not just for 2 minutes every other hour), which means doing anywhere from 70-100 check-ins by myself (with occasional help from my managers, one being way more helpful than the other) , having to answer every single phone call which sometimes results in me having 2+ people on hold while having a line of people at the desk, having to restock the market by myself which is literally impossible, I have to remake the coffee twice a shift which is also impossible unless I want to come out to a line of people at the desk, I also have a houseman who doesn't speak English so when I have room runs for him I have to write it on a piece of paper and run it back to the laundry room for him as he can't use the walkie for communication. I also had a situation in october where my front office manager stopped giving me my mandatory breaks for probably close to 3 weeks if not maybe even longer than that, which I work 10 hour shifts so it was a very miserable time for me. There was another situation when I hit my one year mark of working at the hotel, I was told I had 7 days of PTO that I had to use before the year ended, and when I used the 7 days of PTO I was told I didn't actually qualify for it since I was averaged an hour under what I needed to be working to qualify for PTO so I went unpaid for like 3 of the 7 days, I only got paid for the 4 days because of our state PTO policy. I also was told by my FOM that I am doing 95% of our guest ennrollments which is saving us from being fined for being under our company's enrollment requirements.

I will also add that I am the lowest paid front desk employee at my job, while I feel like I am doing a lot of work since I am the only one on weekends which is our busiest time. Night auditors start at $2 more than me, both of our night auditors are new and have been here for less than 6 months and still actively making mistakes every single shift while making more than me, and everyone else that is on the desk has been here for longer than me by years so I definitely get paid the least out of everyone. My raise this year was $.70, and I scored damn near perfect on my annual review, the FOM and GM both commenting that I almost never make mistakes, always work hard and get good reviews from the guests. I feel taken advantage of, unmotivated to come into work, and honestly just super burnt out. Guests have started leaving comments about how my demeanor isn't the nicest, and I don't like how I feel when I'm at work. 

I have talked to my GM about getting me another front desk agent so I'm not taking on all the work by myself, which he said isn't an option right now. I have been asking for extra help for months. I emailed him a week ago asking about setting up a meeting to arrange a raise  in pay for me, which he kind of already shot me down without any consideration but I'm still going to set up a meeting when I can and discuss why I deserve one, but now I feel like I don't really have any grounds to stand on and I feel like I'm doing a normal amount of work for the job I have and just making a fuss over nothing. I either need to be humbled real quick or encouraged, I don't really know which way to go. Is this normal for a hotel job? Any advice or input is very helpful!

I've been using a Nespresso DeLonghi Lattissima for more than 10 years, and I think it's done a great job, but I'm considering it may be time to get a new one. There are different factors to consider, so I'm gonna try to explain my preferences, so maybe some of you could help me a bit choosing a new machine, cause I'm going crazy reading different articles and reviews.

I find those Vertuo machines really ""sexy"", but I don't think those would be the best for me, cause I like being able to get cheaper pods for my daily coffee, and prepare a ""true Nespresso"" in special moments, or when I want to give myself a whim (and if I'm not mistaken, Vertuo is ONLY NESPRESSO).

  
That said, and going with the Original Nespresso ones, I'd prefer a smaller one compared to my current Lattissima, cause even if I love the steamed milk, in the end I hardly ever use the machine one, cause I have a separate milk frother which is much easier to clean, so I'd just consider a machine with the milk-frother combo if it had a dummies system to clean it, otherwise I prefer a machine without the milk frother.

  
The machine is going to be used for different sizes of coffee, so I'd rather go with a versatile one, and additional perks or things to consider would be said smaller size, not being too noisy, and in general being easy/comfortable to use, clean, remove the pods (the one a friend has seems like you have to juggle every time you want to take out the pods compartment, cause its pieces fall apart whenever you pull it out).

My budget would be pretty flexible, I prefer not spending a lot, but I'm open to all considerations. For now I was leaning towards the Citiz Platinum, even if I'm not that sure about the differences with the standard Citiz, but I'm reading lots of good reviews and comments about the Platinum version. Do you think that one would be a nice choice, all this things considered? Any better/interesting alternative to this model?

The tagline of Kylea G Weight loss Journey is, ""I changed my life with prayer and a playlist of songs.  No surgery, no meds.  Just Jesus.""

DAILY STATS 05/16/24:

0/9 posts discussed prayer

0/9 posts discussed music

1/9 discussed sightseeing 

0/9 shared a recipe

2/9 were about something Kylea ate or drank

1/9 was about limited access to H20 at her accommodation 

1/9 was about 2 Kendra Scott rings

1/9 was about a sunburn

2/9 were about a change in plans

1/9 ""Joe"" referenced God and how proud he is of Kylea ü§î

üì¢ For our friends at Meta, that means that >44% of the monetized content had nothing to do with weight loss, which is the tagline and purpose of her page. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Disordered Eating- Daily WW Points Used (Data compiled from monetized content):

0 WW Points: Plate of scrambled eggs and a plate of seasonal fresh fruit with unknown hot beverage.  

11 WW Points: Sliced Grilled Chicken Breast over lettuce with salsa + 15 tortilla chips and salsa; Unknown Quest protein bar flavor and Vanilla Muscle Milk

 üì¢ For our friends at Meta, that means Kylea consumed 11 out of (up to) 30 daily WW points in maintenance mode= Disordered eating.  This is reported to you daily and is dangerous messaging for those on a weight loss journey.  Please follow your policies on eating disorders and take action.  

Recipes Shared: ZERO

Comments: Get ready for a bumpy ride of alleged half-truths, mistruths, and more... üò≤ 

1. Fig Tree Cafe: Kylea announces after a friendly, kind, and uplifting breakfast experience, she and her sister are ""heading to mark something off of my bucket list that had been on my bucket list for a very long time!  Whale watching!""

‚è∏Ô∏è This post was edited to remove all references to whales.  Kylea's food was not described (just shown), WW points were not listed, and there was no proof her sister was there. 

2. Whale Watching Closed in May: ""Unfortunately the whale watching that we were supposed to do today is closed through the month of May.  It's okay though, we will still make the best of today!  There is still so much to do and see! üíñ""

‚ö†Ô∏è I feel the following interactions display victim mentality:

Follower: ""Isn't the whale watching the reason you took this trip?""

Kylea: ""yes.  But what good will it do for me to sit and be sad about something I can't change."" She quickly followed up with this, ""the app. I got the tour through, I didn't read that it wasn't open for May.  It is what it is.  There isn't anything I can change about it.""

Follower: ""Is there another whale watching company you can try I know there's several in San Diego""

Kylea: ""We will see but I already paid for the pass that included the whale watching and it's not refundable.""

‚è∏Ô∏è Kylea displays signs of CBD, aka shopping addiction.  There were MANY options open 05/16 for whale watching at various price points.  If she can spend thousands on cruises, buy a $610 est. hot tub for her momma, $600+ est on puppy accessories... why won't she pay for her ""bucket list"" whale watching experience? ü§î 

3. No Running H20: Kylea claims there was no running water at her Airbnb starting Wed. night. They bought H20 at the gas station to brush their teeth this morning. ""I am the kind of person that does choose to focus on the positives.""  She closes with this, ""God is still good and we will find other fun things to do while we are here.üíñ""

‚è∏Ô∏è The All- Inclusive Go City Pass for San Diego lists 58 possible attractions. Each option lists important details.  There are plenty of options for Kylea and her sister to enjoy.  

Followers voiced concern about her H20 issue.  Kylea's story changed from issues at an Airbnb to a hotel, but her accommodations didn't change. ü§î There are PLENTY of accommodations available in San Diego.  

Please ignore all previous mocking, blocking, and doxxing behaviors, clap backs, ""someone said"" posts, she's ""addressing this one time"" posts, etc. since she wants you to believe she focuses on the positives...

4. ""It is what it is."" This is on her pink sweatshirt and her motto today.  She took a trolley to Old Town and is seeking her next cup of coffee.  ""Life is beautiful if you focus on all the things going right instead of what isn't. üíñ""

‚è∏Ô∏è People in the real world have real problems, bigger than bottled H20 to brush their teeth with on *another* vacation and misreading a travel app.  Kylea monetizes a frivolous lifestyle, and these posts are tone deaf.   

5. Coyote Cafe in Old Town: Kylea consumed *another* salsa covered grilled chicken salad.  There is no proof her sister is there.  

‚è∏Ô∏è Somehow, Kylea's lactose intolerance paused on this trip, and she is enjoying Vanilla Muscle Milk.  Previously, she could only consume Premier Protein due to tummy issues. üíî  Recently, Froot Loops SixStar shakes made the cut.  Why experiment while on vacation?

6. Monetizing Grams Again: Kylea's right hand is shown in front of a flowering bush. ""I love both of these rings so much.  The butterfly ring for all of the growth I've had in life since 2021 and Grams birthstone as a reminder that she's always with me.üíñ ü¶ã""

‚è∏Ô∏è Kylea will not wear her wedding ring.  When asked what color her nail polish was (in honor of Grams), Kylea did not know.  When asked for a link to the ring (Kendra Scott brand) in honor of Grams, she did not know.  ""I thought it was the Elise but it's not üíî"" When a follower describes jewelry she wears from/for her living children, Kylea replies, ""I'm so sorry for your loss üíî."" 
üò≤  This is your job, Kylea Gomez.

7. Thankful to be able to walk: There were 2 *vastly* different versions of this post. Here is one version: ""I explored Balboa Park in San Diego and walked all the way back to my airbnb.  I'm thankful for the rest of my life that I can walk and do so many things that I couldn't do prior to July 5th of 2021.üëü üíñ""

Kylea is pushing this walking narrative hard right now and on her recent Mexican cruise excursion.  She worked full-time in healthcare in 2021, traveled frequently, and led a productive life.  She was not couch or bed bound by any means.

Why are there no people in the pictures of these popular tourist attractions?  Why do the photos look like post cards or stock photos with no credit given to the photographer/source? ü§î 

8. Sunburn: ""I got a little bit of sun today.""  Her face is bright pink.  

Follower: ""Hope you wear sunscreen.""

Kylea: ""did but I also did a lot of walking.üíñ""

‚è∏Ô∏è Then reapply your sunscreen?  I'm not following her logic...

9. ""Joe"" posted he is proud of Kylea: ""I'm proud of my wife for everything she has accomplished over the last few years and I know that this is just the beginning.  I can't wait to see how God uses her to continue inspiring others. She inspires me every day because she is willing to chase all of her dreams.""

‚è∏Ô∏è ""Joe"" posts these speeches when Kylea is traveling, facing increased criticism from followers or on Reddit.  Do you believe it is Joe posting under Kylea's account with Kylea's name? ü§î 

Sure, Kylea lost a significant amount of weight. How many people has she potentially/actually harmed on the way to her current social media status?  What temporary or permanent damage has occurred to those mimicking her Disordered Eating?  What would happen if she disclosed how she earns her social media income and the payout per month?

In the almost 6 weeks I have provided these daily recaps, Kylea has not attended a church service or Bible study, discussed the Bible, or shared a prayer.  Sure, she references God and Jesus, but... 

‚úùÔ∏è To Kylea and Joe: If you both stand firm in your faith, you should confess *everything* to Kylea's followers and let them decide whether to support you both or not.  

Takeout:
Fig Tree Cafe Breakfast for Kylea= $18 est + tip;
*Possible breakfast for sister (higher est. due to sister's diverse palate and menu prices)= $20 est + tip;
Coyote Cafe Lunch for Kylea= $15 est + tip;
*Possible lunch for sister= $15 est + tip;
Muscle Milk & Quest Bar= $7 est;

Shopping/Travel Expenses:

My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for over 3 years. He‚Äôs not exactly the best gift giver out there, just doesn‚Äôt have a knack for it I guess. He is super thoughtful and sweet with gifts when he wants to be, but sometimes I do have to remind him that my birthday is coming up or Christmas so that he can buy gifts on time. Other than this, we have a very healthy and loving relationship (he‚Äôs perfect!) So that brings us to now. 
He recently went on a trip with his family and when either of us go places, we like to bring back little souvenirs. I usually bring him back stickers or beer glasses, etc. because this pertains to his interests. Well, he got home last night and was showing me the huge shopping haul he had done for himself. Shoes, shirts, hats, everything! Which at first I wasn‚Äôt upset at (he deserves to treat himself) until we got to my gift. He makes me close my eyes and stick my hands out, so I do. When I open them, it‚Äôs a peculiar shaped mug with his favorite sports team on it. I couldn‚Äôt help but to drop my smile and he asked me if I liked it, I told him I do like it I‚Äôm just confused on why this gift. I don‚Äôt drink hot coffee, hot tea sometimes, but not enough to make note about. I also am not interested in sports or this particular team. I told him it seems like he bought it for himself because he is an avid hot coffee drinker AND this is his favorite sports team. We ended up getting in a huge fight and he said I wasn‚Äôt being appreciative and he picked this mug out because it‚Äôs the only thing there that popped out to him. I was head strong last night, but now this morning I feel like a complete asshole. So Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my boyfriend I don‚Äôt like the gift he got me?

EDIT: for more context on the mug, it is a sports team from his hometown and where he went on his trip so it wasn‚Äôt completely random! 

EDIT 2: he did say he bought this shape of mug bc it‚Äôs similar to my favorite mug I use for tea. I also do enjoy buying old mugs if I think they are cute (mostly from goodwill or ceramic), I just don‚Äôt use them very frequently!! ",49,1747401498.0,AmItheAsshole,72,0.88,False

1ko0kcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1ko0kcf/i_get_it_its_just_a_tool_linux_taught_me_a_life/,"I get it, it's just a tool. (Linux taught me a life lesson.)","Switched to Linux from Windows 3 weeks ago (CachyOS) and the first 10 days or so I was going wild with the constant reinstalling, distro-hopping and tweaking. I was feeling this weird dopamine hit from setting up a new Distro/DE and tweaking it, adding new applets, extensions and such. Watching the terminal flow as I was executing a new command feeling a weird happiness from it etc. I think it was also a way of escaping my real responsibilities for a while but that's another topic.

Some time passed and I finally felt satisfied with my system. It was just working and honestly I was seriously getting stressed and tired of constant tinkering. So I decided to just leave it as it is and do what I normally do on a computer. For a while I kept waiting everyday for the rush of watching the system update in the terminal via ""sudo pacman -Syu"" I know, it's weird but it just felt good for some reason.

After some days I decided to let that one go as well and update only once in a couple of days instead of trying the command every 2-3 hours for the dopamine.

Now, the rush of ""switching to Linux"" has passed and my computer has become just a tool once again. I just turn it on, do my business and leave. Nothing special. No more tinkering, no more looking for a new flatpak or some terminal gimmick. It's just my computer.

This makes me realize Linux is not some crazy wild unthinkable dare. It's just an OS, and it's not that different. I just do whatever I used to do when I was using Windows and now my  Linux computer feels like something I'm used to, something home. If ya know what I mean. It's just like Windows but better, lighter, more user friendly, personal and open-source.

Honestly viewing my computer/system this way feels much better and cozier. It truly feels mine and familiar. Not changing things constantly gradually builds up a sense of familiarity that gives a different kind of happiness and calmness when you are using your computer. It's like it's there for you, whenever you need it, just the way it is, just the way you know it to be. For you to use it, for your help. This is such a good feeling.

I certainly felt the same rush of dopamine from ricing, tweaking etc. so I understand folks who are into that but I am getting old and I have other responsibilities and this way of using my computer just feels right and the way it was supposed to be used. It also has it's own unique way of feeling home. Another sort of dopamine.

Now I am no longer flexing to my friends how I switched to Linux and how I am using this cool distro and DE sending them screenshots and such. I just use Linux, that's it. nothing big, nothing crazy. It's just my computer and it's the way I like it, nothing big. Everyone has things they like/ used to and this is just one of them. And if someone notices that my computer looks a bit different I just casually mention ""oh yeah I use Linux it's just a different OS"" if they are curious about it I answer but I don't go too eager to show it to them. Weirdly enough this natural behavior makes them much more interested in it in the long run.

I think this has taught me something about life itself. When we get too invested in constantly getting more and better we are putting ourselves in the risk of missing out on actually appreciating something in a boring way and that is truly something special. Like a morning coffee that you just drink in a certain way every single day and the sound of the rain you like just because it is the way it is from your room. The wallpaper in your walls and the sense of familiarity it brings when you get home from a long trip. This way of appreciation of the boring things makes life richer and reliable which in turn gives way to a sense of stability and constancy allowing you to focus on growing and expanding on the foundation of things that just work on their own so that you don't have to worry about them.

I know I am a bit of a philosophizer but I felt the desire to share this for a  couple of days now so excuse my rambling, hope you guys are having a good day.",75,1747401305.0,linux4noobs,16,0.97,False

‚Äî-------------

**Tyla**

I walked softly into my old room and let out a breath I hadn‚Äôt even realized I was holding.

Everything was just as I‚Äôd left it or at least how Mom had kept it. My bed, still a little lumpy. My old desk, scuffed from long-forgotten school projects. A dusty plush flowerbird in the corner I didn‚Äôt have the heart to throw away. Time hadn‚Äôt moved here. Just me.

I sat down on the edge of the bed. My paws hesitated for a moment, hovering above my pad.

Then I gave in.

Val.

My claws hovered above the screen for just a second too long before I opened the message app. I hated how itchy they felt. Like they *needed* to move. Like I couldn‚Äôt stop myself.

I told myself it was just to make sure he got to the shelter okay. Nothing weird. Nothing stupid. Just being a good teammate. A good friend.

My claws tapped out the message before I could overthink it:

*-you settled in?*

He replied almost instantly. Stars, he was fast.

*-All good. I'm at the shelter. Ran into Washburn, remember him? Big guy, always made that awful powdered coffee on base. He's here.*

Washburn, name sounds familiar. Val used to complain about him during long stakeouts, said his jokes were worse than artillery fire.

I stared at the text for a while longer than I should‚Äôve.

My chest tightened, though it was different than that time at the terminal. This was something else. A weird, warm, clenching ache.

I typed:

*-didn‚Äôt know he was also on paid leave.*

Another pause.

*-He isn‚Äôt. Got discharged. But he stuck around. Said he liked the quiet here.*

I started to type something‚Ä¶ something stupid, like *glad you‚Äôre not alone*,¬† but stopped. My claws hovered again. Annoyed with themselves.

Why did I care so much?

Why did I feel like my chest might collapse when I imagined him not replying?

This wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt *that*. We were friends. Good friends. We‚Äôd fought together. Slept back to back. Saved each other‚Äôs tails.

That was all.

Right?

I shook my head, irritated with myself. I dropped the pad onto the bed and flopped backward with a low huff, tail draped over the side.

Above me, the ceiling was dim, painted gold by the unchanging sky outside. The light didn‚Äôt shift. It just *was*. Like the past few weeks hadn‚Äôt happened. Like I hadn‚Äôt changed.

But I had.

I closed my eyes and let the quiet hold me. Still not ready to think too hard about why my claws itched when I texted him. Or why my heart beat so much faster when he replied.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I woke to the faint hush of a house that had already moved on without me.

No scent of stew or fresh strayu in the air. No murmured voices. No little Jhem crashing around the hall pretending to be a fighter jet. I pulled myself upright and rubbed the sleep from my eyes, stretching with a long groan.

Home again.

I reached for my pad, clawtips tapping it open. One message from Val still hovered at the top of the list, unopened since before I dozed off. I swallowed and swiped it down for now.

Instead, I scrolled to an old familiar name and fired off a message.

**-Me:** *Guess who‚Äôs finally planet-side?*

It didn‚Äôt even take ten seconds.

**-Kaija:**¬† *NO.¬† Are you serious?? THE Tyla? The actual ghost of Darkriver returns?? Stars, I thought you died doing flips off an Arxur gunship or something!!*

I laughed into my pillow.

**-Me** *Sorry to disappoint. No dramatic explosions. Yet.*

**Kaija:**¬† *YET. Don‚Äôt tease me like that, come on! I want stories. About explosions. About predators. About you charging through a hailstorm of blaster fire in sloooow motion*.

I rolled onto my back, tail flicking.

**-Me:**¬† *Kaija. I‚Äôm not an action movie.*

**-Kaija:** *You‚Äôre MY action movie.* üòè *Tell me everything! Please tell me you actually met one of those humans, right? You have to give me the details. Are they as tall and terrifying and weirdly kind of hot as they say?*

Oh no.

**-Me:**¬† *We did‚Ä¶ interact, yes.*

**-Kaija:** *OH SPEH. I KNEW IT. You shook a human hand, didn‚Äôt you. You looked right into their horrifying eyes. Did it unlock something primal? Did you start monologuing about fate and war and tragic attraction??*

**-Me:** *I will jump off a building.*

**-Kaija:**¬† *AFTER DRINKS YOU WILL. The Pit, same old spot? I‚Äôll reserve our table. And I swear if you don‚Äôt bring the JUICIEST gossip...*

**-Me:** *I‚Äôll be there. ‚Ä¶Do they still serve that rootberry wine you like?*

**-Kaija:** ¬†*They do. And you‚Äôre drinking with me. Military leave counts as celebration. Don‚Äôt be late. I missed your fuzzy tail, even if it‚Äôs always running off into danger.*

I smiled down at the screen, warmth curling into my chest. Kaija hadn‚Äôt changed a bit. Still sharp-tongued, still dramatic, still the only person in this town who could outtalk me.

And maybe a drink wouldn‚Äôt be the worst idea.

I got up, brushed myself off, and started getting ready. Just for a few moments, I‚Äôd be a regular Venlil again. Not a soldier, not a daughter dodging questions. Just Tyla.

\_\_\_\_\_

I spotted her before I even stepped inside. That ridiculously puffy, nightside white wool, round figure, those huge black eyes scanning the street with barely concealed excitement, and that tail... It was swishing back and forth like she was trying fly with it.

Kaija stood up from the outdoor table the second she saw me. ‚ÄúTylaaa!‚Äù

‚ÄúKaija!‚Äù

We slammed into each other with the kind of hug that would‚Äôve knocked a smaller Venlil over. Her wool was just as soft as I remembered, the texture so unmistakably familiar. I buried my snout in her shoulder for a heartbeat longer than I meant to. It really had been too long.

‚ÄúI thought you were dead!‚Äù she squealed, pulling back and holding me at arm‚Äôs length. ‚ÄúOr promoted! Or married to a Kolshian admiral!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have such reasonable expectations,‚Äù I said, laughing. ‚ÄúI missed you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMissed me? Tyla, you vanished off the face of the planet! I had to stalk military news feeds to even catch a whisper about you! You know how boring it is around here without someone tall and scary to yell at the exterminator squad for fun?‚Äù

I chuckled and followed her to the table, sliding into the seat across from her. ‚ÄúYou really haven‚Äôt changed a bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you,ugh, you look too good. That whole ‚Äòbrushed by death‚Äô thing is working for you.‚Äù Her eyes sparkled as she flagged the waiter with a claw. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drinking, right? You‚Äôre drinking. Don‚Äôt say no.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I said, already planning to get plastered.

Kaija ordered for both of us before I could even glance at the menu: two glasses of some kind of rootberry liquor that had a nasty kick but went down clean, and a bowl of salted imported nuts, hard little things, half-dried and baked until they cracked under your teeth. My stomach gave a happy growl at the sight.

By the time the drinks arrived, Kaija‚Äôs tail was going crazy behind her, swishing, curling, thumping lightly against the chair legs. It was all I could do not to start laughing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wagging that tail like a schoolgirl.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not!‚Äù she lied, tail still going.

‚ÄúYou are. I feel like you‚Äôre going to fly into orbit.‚Äù

‚ÄúI might! My best friend is finally home, and I‚Äôve got the whole evening to drag every bit of juicy gossip out of her!‚Äù She took a long sip from her glass, then pointed at me with it. ‚ÄúStarting with what it‚Äôs like working with actual humans.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare retreat now, soldier. I have questions. I have *so many* questions.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes and leaned back in my chair, glass in hand, letting the warmth from the drink spread through my throat. It stung, but not in a bad way.

‚ÄúAlright. Ask away.‚Äù

Kaija leaned in with her chin propped on one paw, eyes gleaming with mischief. ‚ÄúOkay, okay. So. First question.‚Äù

I sipped from my glass, bracing. ‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they really fight like the vids show? Charging into danger without flinching, yelling stuff like ‚Äòmove, move, move‚Äô while explosions happen in the background?‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúNot *exactly* like that, but‚Ä¶ yeah, kind of. They're loud. Intense. Coordinated. No hesitation once the plan‚Äôs in motion.‚Äù

Kaija‚Äôs tail flicked. ‚ÄúSounds terrifying.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is. But when they‚Äôre on your side, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ kind of reassuring.‚Äù

She raised a brow. ‚ÄúAnd they don‚Äôt, like, freak out under pressure?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúIf anything, they seem more focused when things go wrong. It‚Äôs eerie.‚Äù

Kaija nodded thoughtfully, then tossed a snack in her mouth and crunched it down. ‚ÄúHuh. That‚Äôs impressive. I always figured their brains would short-circuit from the stress.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey do,‚Äù I said dryly, ‚Äú*after* everything‚Äôs over. Then they collapse like tired pups and eat six meals in a row.‚Äù

She barked a laugh, lifting her glass. ‚ÄúTo predator metabolism!‚Äù

‚ÄúTo predator metabolism,‚Äù I echoed, clinking mine against hers.

The next round came and went. Kaija was slouching into the seat now, her voice getting just the tiniest bit louder, a tell I knew too well. Her eyes narrowed as she chewed thoughtfully on another snack.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said slowly, swirling her drink. ‚ÄúWhat are they‚Ä¶ like?‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need to be more specific.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶‚Äù she leaned closer, glancing around with the *least* subtle attempt at discretion I‚Äôd ever seen. ‚ÄúWhat are they *like* like?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Kaija.‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean *physically!*"" she protested, ears flicking. ""Like, up close. You‚Äôve been deployed with them, you‚Äôve probably seen stuff. Are the muscles real? Do they sweat too much? Are the claws big?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have claws.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, but the teeth? Are they all sharp and scary, or is it more like ‚Äògrin and bear it‚Äô adorable?‚Äù

I gave her a long look.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre *interested* in them, aren‚Äôt you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI-no-I mean‚Ä¶ interested is such a strong word.‚Äù Her tail was practically vibrating. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I enjoy... observing alien physiology. For science.‚Äù

I whistled hard enough to choke on my drink. ‚ÄúScience?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! The noble pursuit of knowledge! And hey, if some of them happen to be tall, and maybe a little bit gruff, with nice forearms. hmmph‚Äù

‚ÄúKaija.‚Äù

‚Äúand those deep voices‚Äù

‚ÄúKAIIJA.‚Äù

She collapsed into giggles, waving a paw. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm *kidding*, I‚Äôm kidding! Mostly. Come on, you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs been up close and personal! Don‚Äôt act like you haven‚Äôt noticed anything.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes but felt the tips of my ears warming. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that. I didn‚Äôt stare at them like‚Ä¶like that!‚Äù

‚ÄúMmhm. Sure. You totally didn‚Äôt notice if any of them had nice shoulders or a commanding voice or an aura of danger and smoke and mystery‚Äù

I threw a nut at her.

She dodged and cackled, tail thumping under the table. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre blushing!‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are so! Oh stars, it‚Äôs *him*, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

I froze for half a breath.

Kaija‚Äôs eyes widened like she‚Äôd just cracked a conspiracy. ‚ÄúIt *is*, isn‚Äôt it?! You totally have a favorite! One of them‚Äôs your war buddy slash forbidden crush!‚Äù

‚ÄúI swear to every deity I will walk out of this bar-‚Äù

She was practically howling with laughter now, clutching her belly. ‚ÄúI KNEW IT!‚Äù

I grumbled something under my breath and drained the rest of my drink, ears folded down to hide the heat.

I should‚Äôve known better.

I really, truly should‚Äôve.

But between the alcohol warming my chest, the dim pub lighting, and Kaija‚Äôs relentless giggling, I made the mistake of unlocking my pad and pulling up the *least incriminating* picture I had of Valent√≠n.

¬†Val was standing with his arms crossed, wearing that annoyingly stoic expression he defaulted to, some combat gear still on, helmet off, hair pulled back. His whole posture screamed ‚Äúdo not mess with me.‚Äù

I held the pad out. ‚ÄúHere. But just a quick look, alright?‚Äù

Kaija leaned in and immediately screamed.

‚ÄúHOT DAMN, TYLA, THAT‚ÄôS A BIG ONE!!‚Äù

Half the bar turned toward us. A pair of older Venlil sipping fizzy fruit wine in the corner nearly choked.

‚ÄúKaija!‚Äù I yanked the pad away, mortified. ‚ÄúLower your voice!‚Äù

She ignored me completely, slamming a paw on the table and laughing like she‚Äôd just won the lottery. ‚ÄúYou *lied* to me! That‚Äôs not just a soldier, that‚Äôs a walking slab of death muscle! Look at those arms, really, *look at them*, I could nap in one of those biceps!‚Äù

I buried my face in my paws. ‚ÄúPlease stop.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the *chest*! Does he have to be that broad? What‚Äôs he smuggling in there, a dropship?!‚Äù

‚ÄúKaija, for the love of-‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd look at that stance!‚Äù she kept going, ignoring my strangled groan. ‚ÄúAll serious and brooding and probably thinking deep violent thoughts like *‚ÄòI‚Äôll protect you, little prey lady, now hand me that autocannon.‚Äô*‚Äù

I nearly slammed my face into the table.

Kaija grinned, waving her empty glass. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt flustered because you were embarrassed, you were flustered because you‚Äôre into the *big scary predator*! Don‚Äôt lie to me, Tyla, I know that look!‚Äù

‚ÄúI am *not* into him,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a squadmate. A friend. He covered for me. That‚Äôs *it*.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh sure,‚Äù she mocked, ‚ÄúI *always* get butterflies when someone covers for me at customs. Total platonic experience.‚Äù

I groaned again, trying to slide under the table.

Kaija just leaned over, eyes twinkling. ‚ÄúTell me this, then‚Ä¶ what does he *sound* like?‚Äù

I hesitated. Wrong move.

Her grin sharpened. ‚ÄúI knew it! He‚Äôs got the voice, doesn‚Äôt he? That gravelly predator bass that sounds like it could start a landslide but also, like, read bedtime stories.‚Äù

‚ÄúWHY are you like this?!‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause this is the best thing that‚Äôs happened to me in weeks!‚Äù Kaija declared, tail now a violent blur behind her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been hiding a hot murder beast this whole time! And he‚Äôs into you too, isn‚Äôt he? I *bet* he is.‚Äù

Then she made a face.

Not just *a* face.

The most perverted, devious, absolutely cursed expression I had *ever* seen on a Venlil. Her eyes narrowed into gleaming slits, ears perked with mischief, mouth pulled into a crooked human-like snarl, like she was about to unlock ancient, forbidden knowledge.

¬†If someone had captured that look on a datapad, it would‚Äôve gone viral in seconds with captions like *‚Äúwhen the tea is hot AND spicy.‚Äù* I could almost see the internet memes forming.

And then she leaned closer, lowering her voice to an absolutely dangerous whisper.

‚ÄúBut seriously though‚Ä¶ *how does it even* ***fit?****‚Äù*

My brain broke. I think my soul tried to eject itself from my body.

‚ÄúKAIIJA!!‚Äù I screeched, nearly knocking over my drink. ‚ÄúWHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!‚Äù

She doubled over laughing, nearly falling out of her seat, squealing like a malfunctioning engine. ‚ÄúI mean COME ON, Tyla! He‚Äôs, like, *twice* your height! And don‚Äôt even get me started on those shoulders. There‚Äôs gotta be‚Ä¶ mechanical complications or something!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not-! We didn‚Äôt-! WHY would you even *think* of that?!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one making dreamy eyes at him in the middle of a battlefield!‚Äù

‚ÄúI was NOT-!‚Äù I put my paws over my face, every strand of wool on my ears burning. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a friend! A *friend*! A squadmate! A colleague! I‚Äôd be dead without him!‚Äù

‚ÄúOoooh, I bet you‚Äôd be dead *with* him, too.‚Äù She moved her ears suggestively.

‚ÄúOH MY STARS, STOP TALKING!‚Äù

I considered hurling my drink at her just to shut her up. She probably would‚Äôve just caught it with her tail and taken another sip, the smug little demon.

Kaija leaned back with a sly glint in her dark eyes, curling her paws together like some kind of villain. Her tail gave a slow, plotting twitch. I could *feel* the trap forming in her brain.

Then, she tilted her head, blinking all innocent-like. Too innocent.

‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre not into him,‚Äù she said with a slow cadence, playing coy ‚Äúthen do you mind if *I-*‚Äù

‚ÄúYES I WOULD MIND!‚Äù I blurted before my brain could get a word in.

Stars. Stars above. STARS BELOW.

I froze. Kaija froze. There was one heavy, silent beat.

Then her laugh exploded across the room like a detonation.

‚ÄúOhhhh, *see*?!‚Äù she shrieked, pointing a claw at me like she‚Äôd just won the lottery. ‚ÄúYou *do* like him! You don‚Äôt think of him as a friend, you think of him as something *more!* I knew it! I KNEW IT!‚Äù

I let out the most strangled internal scream my soul was capable of. My ears were practically sizzling. My tail had wrapped itself into a guilty little coil under the table.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it like that,‚Äù I mumbled, burying my face in my paws. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just-he‚Äôs my *battle buddy*, and you can‚Äôt just say things like that, Kaija!‚Äù

She laughed even harder. ‚ÄúTyla. Darling. Woolball. If you didn‚Äôt mean it like that, your answer would‚Äôve been ‚Äògo ahead.‚Äô But nooo, instead you barked like a jealous mate trying to protect her big scary man.‚Äù

‚ÄúI AM NOT-!‚Äù

‚ÄúNot what?‚Äù she interrupted with a sing-song lilt. ‚ÄúNot jealous? Not in love? Not trying to figure out how to smuggle him into your house without your mom busting in with a frying pan?‚Äù

I squeaked. *Squeaked*.

She laughed like she had won a whole season‚Äôs worth of gossip.

‚ÄúStop squeaking and admit it!‚Äù Kaija sang.

‚ÄúI am going to throw you off the balcony,‚Äù I growled, face planted firmly in the table again. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky I missed you.‚Äù

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Jyla**

I stepped into the house, letting the dim hush of Darkriver settle over me like it always did at this claw of the cycle. The air inside was still and familiar, slightly warmer than outside, quiet in that comforting, lived-in way. Tam wasn‚Äôt home yet, and Jhem would still be at school for another quarter-claw.

It was peaceful. For a moment, I just stood there and soaked it in.

Then I noticed the utility belt slung haphazardly over the hook near the door,military issue, weighted with pouches and scorched in a few places. Tyla‚Äôs.

My ears flicked with something that might have been relief. She was really home again.

I padded softly down the hallway. Her door was ajar, just like when she was a pup. I remember she used to insist on that, something about not wanting to feel ""closed in."" Some habits never changed.

She was lying on her bedding in the most graceless sprawl imaginable. One limb off the edge, tail draped behind her, ears twitching faintly in sleep. Her expression was slack with exhaustion.

Poor girl.

The air near her carried the faintest taste of alcohol, strong stuff, the kind Kaija liked to sneak into family gatherings. I flicked my tongue against the air once more to be sure. Yes, unmistakable. She'd gone out for a drink, probably with Kaija then.

Good. She deserved it.

I looked down at her, sleeping so deeply, and I saw her grandfather again. The same fire. The same boldness. The same stubborn refusal to let the world make her small. He would‚Äôve been proud of her‚Ä¶

My paw brushed her belt as I picked it up to set it aside. The clasps were worn, the fabric frayed near the holster. I ran a claw along one of the tears,burn damage. I didn‚Äôt want to think about what caused it.

No pup of mine should ever have worn something like this.

And yet‚Ä¶ here she was. She came back.

I folded the belt neatly and placed it on her desk. Let her rest. She could tell us the war stories later. Or not. That was her choice now.

Maybe when she woke up, I‚Äôd even let her pour me a drink. After all, I could use one too.

Beside the belt, tucked near the edge of her desk, sat her datapad.

Still on. Still blinking.

I glanced toward the bed. Tyla hadn‚Äôt stirred, her face was tucked into the pillow, tail limp. But that blinking light‚Ä¶

I leaned closer. Just a message. Probably from that troublemaker Kaija. They‚Äôd always giggled over the silliest things, shared memes I never understood. I told myself I was just making sure it wasn‚Äôt something urgent. That was all.

Before I could talk myself out of it, my claws were already tapping in the passcode. The one she always used. Still unchanged.

The screen blinked to life.

I went to the gallery first, my instincts guiding me like. Just some worried matron poking through her daughter‚Äôs memory box.

At first, it was what I expected. Old photos. Boot camp. Bunkmates. Laughing Venlil girls in training harnesses, wool matted with mud. Then‚Ä¶

Then I saw *him*.

Front-facing eyes. Mask off.

I froze.

His dark eyes were *inky*, bottomless things stared directly into the camera. *Predator‚Äôs gaze*. My wool stood on end. His face was of a sandy color, weathered, almost stony. But alive with some awful confidence. Like he knew he didn‚Äôt belong in a civilized place and didn‚Äôt care.

Another photo. He was grinning now. Goofing around with another red furred human wearing a strange hat, just as bulky, laughing mid-motion. Teeth. *So many teeth.*

And then *another photo*.

This time, he was bare-chested. No cloth, no armor, nothing but muscle and scars. Arms thick as tree trunks. His chest looked like a war crime. My gut flipped. Why in the void would Tyla keep a picture like *that*?

I‚Äôd heard things. That humans were prudish. That they always covered themselves. That showing too much was seen as shameful in their culture.

So why did my daughter have this? Was she *admiring* him?

I recoiled, ears pinning back. A lump formed in my throat.

Please no.

I swiped away from the gallery, trying to reset my mind. Maybe it was innocent. Maybe it was.

No, it wasn‚Äôt.

I tapped into her messages.

It wasn‚Äôt from Kaija.

The thread was marked ‚ÄúValent√≠n.‚Äù

His writing was clean, polite. He called her ‚Äútough girl‚Äù and ‚Äúsoldier‚Äù with this‚Ä¶ tenderness that made my stomach tighten. Nothing crude. Just‚Ä¶ gentle.

*‚ÄúLet me know when you‚Äôre home. You made it this far, you better make it all the way. Stay safe, okay?‚Äù*

She had replied with a few emojis. Friendly ones, naturally. But warm. Too warm.

There was a draft.

She hadn‚Äôt sent it. But she‚Äôd written it.

*I miss you.*

I locked the pad again and set it back where I‚Äôd found it, paw trembling slightly as I pulled away.

Stars above. My stomach twisted in a sick knot. I stood there for a moment, paws limp at my sides, staring at nothing.

She was in love with it. That thing. That *predator*.

Tam‚Ä¶ Tam had *joked*. Or at least, I‚Äôd *thought* it was a joke, his paranoid, absurd suggestion that they‚Äôd already‚Ä¶ *mated*. I‚Äôd been so furious, so sure that our daughter was still a proper Venlil, that she had her dignity, her standards. But now‚Ä¶

What if he wasn‚Äôt wrong?

That image, *that image* of the human without any coverings, bare and grotesque, seared itself into my mind again. The shape of him, the *eyes*. Those were the features of a killer, not a companion. He looked more like something you‚Äôd find in a cave on a feral world than in someone‚Äôs private gallery.

What in the world was Tyla *thinking*?

She hadn‚Äôt even deleted it. That was the worst part. She‚Äôd *kept* it. Looked at it, probably liked it. What if she‚Äôd stared at it the way I used to look at those pictures of her father, back when we were courting?

I felt bile on the back of my tongue.

I wanted to scream. To shake her awake, shout: *What are you doing?! Are you out of your mind?!* I wanted to demand answers, to forbid her from ever seeing that monster again. But‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt.

No. That wouldn‚Äôt work.

Tyla had always been willful. Brave, yes, but stubborn as frozen bark. And if I pushed too hard, she would just *dig in*. She would defend that‚Ä¶ creature. She‚Äôd accuse me of not understanding. She might even leave.

I couldn‚Äôt risk that.

I sat on the edge of her bed, just long enough to collect myself. Her breath was soft behind me , dreaming, probably. Digging into the pillow, unburdened by the storm she‚Äôd left behind her.

I breathed in, held it, and let it go in one slow, controlled exhale.

Tam needed to hear this. He deserved to know.

No‚Ä¶ *he needed* to know. As much as I hated to admit it, his paranoia wasn‚Äôt baseless anymore. This was real. This was happening. And we would need to act carefully, together, if we were going to fix this.

I stood up. Adjusted the datapad back exactly where it had been, angling it just so.

I left her room without a sound.

She could sleep a little longer.

Stars forgive us both.

1ko0ibi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ko0ibi,UK - The Great London Lush Crawl,"Bit of background, 8 years ago, just before my eldest daughter was due to start University, we were hit by a drunk driver, leaving me in a wheelchair and her facing years of surgeries, rehab and some really deep scars.

Lush has always been a safe place for her, the one cometic shop where she didn't feel judged or looked down on because of the scars. 

Well last week she finally completed her Masters and when I asked her where she wanted to go to celebrate, she said she'd love a trip to the Lush Perfume Wall in SoHo to choose her ""signature scent"" for her first job. Well, that turned into a mammoth 5 Lush stores in two days trip.

Day 1 - Liverpool Street Station Lush. First stop when meeting her off the train in London. This is a typical London Train Station Lush. It's on the upper concourse, the building are light and airy but its not big. They had a limited number of the face products and plan to have them on rotation, but did have Mrs Whippy,  so we got that.  My daughter told them our grand plan and they gifted us two sets of the cucumber eye gel pads. Lovely little shop, as all of the Lush Station shops tend to be.

Day 1 - Lush Covent Garden (Sorry no pictures). Covent Garden itself is not the most wheelchair friendly area of London but the shop is. The shop is very light and airy and easy to maneuver around. The staff chatted to us about so of the new products and we came away with samples of the love and kindness mask and the Rosey and blueberry cleansers... reviews coming.

We tried Mrs Whippy mask with the eye masks in the hotel that evening 

Day 2 - Lush Perfume Wall in SoHo. We stopped in the Covent Garden area and it was a short cab ride to Beak Street. The shop is small with a subtle Orange facade. There is a small step into the shop, which I knew about so had packed my crutches. The shop is very low key inside with lots of wood, sorry again only a photo of the outside. The perfumes are on display around the outside. 

We were both looking for something different, so we had an assistant each (you don't need to book but you may have to wait for a consultation). The consultation starts with a chat about what you are looking for as far as scent families, day or night and seasonal. They then took us separately around the walls, helping us to narrow down. I came away with 29 High Street, which I'm in love with. My daughter came away with Furze, Chelsea Morning for the day time and Hungarian Fronds for the evening.  The boxes are exclusive to there and it's well worth a trip especially if you want something new. I will be going back.

Day 2 - the Mother Ship - Oxford Street.
There is literally a 5 - 10 minute walk or roll in my case, between the Perfume Wall and the Oxford Street Shop, and so easy to navigate between the two. We were booked in for the ""Good Hour"" massage. This is my 5th or 6th different Lush Spa and is second only to Cardiff for the whole experience. 2 hours of pure pampering with plenty of water, tea and fresh fruit on offer.

After that we seriously shopped. All of the new stuff was in and we both were given a trial of the new facial sugar scrubs, review incoming... they are good quality. Lots of staff on hand and in no way pushy, just happy to chat.

There is a lift so completely accessible. We also enjoyed a coffee at tge in house coffee shop and a look around the Poetry Pharmacy which is based in there as well as buying some flowers from the in house florist. 

And the community scrubs were marked as get them whilst you can, going soon. The shop is well laid out and although busy it didn't feel cramped. 

They gave us a full size Mineralise me and a Koji Paste... do not ask me when my daughter is going to use all of these.

Day 2 - Paddington Station Lush. Just before heading home, we popped into the Paddington Station Lush as my daughter had forgotten some of the dragon cloud eye masks.

A very small Lush but very friendly staff. Great for the ""whoops I forgot "" moments when travelling. They also had the XL Lush Kitchen boxes for April, so she treated herself to that as well.

We met so many nice people over the last few days, seriously shopped and tried so many products. 

... No 2 daughter is now planning for a similar trip when she finishes her A-levels next month.",15,1747401149.0,LushCosmetics,4,0.94,False
1ko0i7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1ko0i7h/does_10x_health_vitamin_d3_k2_review_prove_its/,Does 10X Health Vitamin D3 K2 Review Prove Its Bone and Heart Benefits?,"The 10X Health System B0D5ZSTFM1 Vitamin D3 5000 IU & K2 MK7 high-potency supplement has been a daily addition to my health routine for a month, and I‚Äôve formed a full picture of its effectiveness. Packed with 125 mcg of Vitamin D3 and 90 mcg of Vitamin K2, this product targets essential aspects of bone density, heart health, and overall wellness. While impressed with its performance, I found there are a few things worth noting. Let‚Äôs dig into my experience.  

**Convenient Design and Usage**  
The compact size of the bottle fits perfectly in a medicine cabinet or a travel bag, and the capsules themselves are quite manageable in size. The instructions recommend taking one capsule daily, making it incredibly low maintenance. With a busy work schedule, I appreciate how straightforward it is to incorporate this into my routine. Unlike powdered supplements that often create a mess, these capsules save time and effort.  

**Benefits**  
- The blend of Vitamin D3 and K2 supports calcium absorption and bone health.  
- Capsules are easy to swallow with no unpleasant aftertaste.  
- Compact packaging makes it travel-friendly.  

[Check 10X Health System B0D5ZSTFM1 price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0d5zstfm1/)

**Impact on Bone Health**  
Post-workout routines have started to feel less taxing. The supplement aims to shuttle calcium into the bones rather than soft tissues like arteries. This intent behind combining Vitamin K2 and D3 is thoughtfully targeted. Coming from a family with a history of osteoporosis, improving and maintaining bone density is a top priority for me. I trust this supplement to keep my bones strong, especially since it's made by U.S.-based 10X Health Ventures, LLC, taking quality seriously.  

**Heart Health Improvements**  
What really sets this product apart for me is its cardiovascular focus. With Vitamin K2 preventing calcium from making its way into arteries, there‚Äôs an added layer of reassurance. Though I can‚Äôt measure arterial health in a month, the peace of mind knowing the microscopic benefits are accruing is worth it.  

**Taste and Dietary Requirements**  
Being unflavored works in its favor‚Äîit means there's no clashing with morning coffee or juice. I also appreciate that it's gluten-free‚Äîvital for friends and family with dietary restrictions.  

**Downsides**  
- Capsules may be slightly inconvenient for those who prefer chewables.  
- Other users might find the daily dosage too minor for specific needs.  
- High potency might not suit those only starting with Vitamin D/K supplementation.  

**Competing Brands**  
Before this, I tried a generic brand with D3-only capsules. While that option aided in Vitamin D levels, it lacked comprehensive calcium management features. Products focusing just on Vitamin D3 fail at directing calcium effectively, which is why Vitamin K2 integration gives this supplement an edge. At the same time, some competitors offer formulas with added magnesium or zinc for an even broader effect spectrum, so anyone considering this should weigh their specific health concerns.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Given that the daily one-capsule dose stretches a single bottle across two months, it feels like an excellent option for long-term wellness. While there might be slightly cheaper alternatives, they could miss the K2 pairing or compromise on purity. Investing wisely in health often justifies spending a bit more for the right combination of features.

Pt15 

As Jamie and Reggie sat in the room, cups of coffee steaming in the simulated afternoon light streaming in from the holo display on the wall, the conversation lulling gently from idle chat to Reggie telling stories to a rapt Jamie, there was a soft voice that rung through their communicators. 

‚ÄúGood Afternoon, would it be okay if I enter?‚Äù. 

Jamie tensed slightly at the sound and stood to face the door, his guard still high to new people. Reggie just smiled and replied ‚ÄúPlease come in Dorian, mind your head on the low ceiling‚Äù. 

As the door opened Jamie looked at the entrance, taught like a bowstring, but trying not to show it. Then the Dracorlix walked through the door, to Jamie's eyes looking like a gigantic, draconcic robot, causing his eyes to flick from the huge dragon like being to Reggie and back. Reggie calmly placing a hand on his shoulder, reassuring him. 

‚ÄúPlease sit down Dorian, I'd like to introduce you to Jamie, the hero of the hour‚Äù said Reggie with a flourish and a smile, gesturing at the chairs and then to Jamie. 

‚ÄúCrud. I'd heard you were a specimen, but I'd never dreamed this was possible‚Äù said Dorian, walking slowly to one of the chairs at the table and taking a seat. ‚ÄúI thought Reggie was something to behold but you are a literal biological marvel!‚Äù he gushed, looking Jamie up and down, clearly at a loss as to what to say or do in that moment. 

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ Dorian‚Ä¶ Didn't you have some things you wanted to talk to Jamie about? I know he has questions too‚Äù said Reggie, with what sounded a bit like a sullen tone. 

‚ÄúSorry friend, you're not jealous are you?‚Äù teased Dorian ‚ÄúYou know I value your mind as well as your resilience. But yes, of course, ask away bud‚Äù he said a slow rhythm to his words, while appearing to take a long toke on a pipe-like apparatus. 

‚ÄúWhat are Dracorlix? Why does the parasite like Sarlans?‚Äù said Jamie, a wrinkle forming on his brow as he sat on a chair opposite the visitor, his mannerisms still cagey. 

‚ÄúWell would you be opposed to a little bit of a reorganise in here so that we could talk face to face?‚Äù said Dorian, another wisp of pink smoke coming from the pipe ‚Äúyou might feel less on edge and it's easier to explain things. I can't handle your gravity you see, so I'd need to access the room pad‚Äù he explained. 

‚ÄúFine, go ahead‚Äù grunted Jamie, his gruffness a cover for his nerves. As he fought every instinct in him to try and remain seated the Dracorlix stood up and turned to the pad on the wall, tapping it at speed, a few aspects of the room moved almost instantly, then a large frame emerged from where the bed had begun to ripple as the bed gave way to that and a large chair. The light in that space had also changed subtly, giving it a reddish glow. 

As the Dracorlix moved into the space, they seemed to heave a sigh of relief as they plugged the frame into their robotic suit, the suit hissing as it opened along the seams. The suit continued to lock into place on the frame, with each component part of it opening up to reveal the alien inside of it. 

Standing around 7 feet tall with dark grey skin, bordering on black, Dorian stepped out of the suit, revealing wings that sprouted from the upper middle of his back, the wings sporting a shiny, metallic look to the leading edges along with his shoulders and the crest on their head. Their Draconic look was not lost on Jamie as he eyed the two metallic claws that ended each limb and the rows upon rows of sharp looking teeth in their mouth, oriented similarly to a sharks. 

‚ÄúPlease don't be alarmed pal, I could no more hurt you than turn into a bedding nest‚Äù chuckled Dorian ‚ÄúBut now you can see me and hopefully my vulnerability will reassure you that you needn't worry about me my dude‚Äù he said warmly, stretching his tail and seeming to perk up by the second. 

‚ÄúOh, you're probably wondering what all this is?‚Äù he said, gesturing at the changes he'd make to the room ‚ÄúWell I have very brittle supporting bodily structures, due to having very thin air on our home world that is high in oxygen. That's why I have to wear the suit in the ship and top up my Ox levels with that pipe, plus it tastes good that way, so always a bonus!‚Äù he chuckled, as he seated himself in the chair. 

Jamie seemed completely confused, how could something so terrifying looking be harmless? He thought to himself. ‚ÄúWhat you mean brittle?‚Äù he managed to grunt, the thoughts of what this guy even was still swimming in his brain. 

‚ÄúWell like I said, thin air calls for light weight to fly. Our prey is insects and we evolved aluminium honeycomb to replace our structures over time with a symbiotic relationship to an organism on our home world that is found on those same insects. It's lightweight but strong in specific directions, so it works, but leaves us vulnerable to more‚Ä¶ Robust types‚Äù he said gesturing at Jamie ‚Äúhowever, after we left our home world to join the council we encountered a species that the organism that benefited us took a shine to, Sarlans. It consumes them‚Äù he said, his face betraying nothing, but his wings shifting and flapping at the mention of this. 

Jamie was rocked by this news. His mind was in turmoil, nothing about this situation made sense! Here was the most dangerous looking thing on the ship, supposedly infested with the most dangerous parasite on the ship, unfazed by it despite it having literally turned someone into a monster less than 24 hours ago. But it thinks I could crush it easily?! Thought Jamie, has mouth agape at the whole scenario, totally unsure what to do. ‚ÄúWhy have you told me this?‚Äù Jamie managed at long last ‚ÄúReggie nearly died fighting the monster‚Äù. 

Dorian shifted uncomfortably in his chair. ‚ÄúThat's why I'm here and disrobed‚Äù he seemed to grow small ‚ÄúIf Reggie chooses it, I shall walk into the great void. I failed and people died‚Äù he said, a sombre tone in his communications and Jamie felt the emotional transference of deep remorse that leaked into it. 

‚ÄúDon't be ridiculous‚Äù cut in Reggie, a note of annoyance in his voice ‚ÄúYou're always so dramatic Dor, how the hell could you have known, not even the scanners picked it up‚Äù he scoffed, clearly not entertaining the idea of his friend offering his life as recompense. 

Dorian flinched slightly at the outburst, but nodded and sat in silence while Jamie processed the interaction. For a moment they all sat, drinking from their respective cups and thinking until the silence was broken by Jamie of all people. 

‚ÄúWhat do we do now? Can we help the Captain? Figured you'd know‚Äù he said to Dorian. 

‚ÄúI'm afraid not, there's only one course of action now that we have an infected Sarlan aboard. We have to take him to Deathworld 211, he will live out what's left of his life among others like him if there are any alive‚Äù said Dorian with a sigh ‚ÄúI'm sorry you two had to be the ones to be involved in this, but we should probably meet what's left of the crew being as we three comprise the ranking officers and only pilot that still has both arms‚Äù. 

For the third time in the last 20 minutes Jamie looked totally stunned. His jaw gaping he looked at the two of them, back and forth until he finally said ‚Äúuh‚Ä¶ You're kidding right?‚Äù.

1ko0h60,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ko0h60/finding_thrill_in_peaceful_travel/,Finding ‚Äúthrill‚Äù in peaceful travel,"Admittedly I‚Äôm trying to become a better traveler and find fun in more relaxing environments and I have no idea how to do it. My husband and I tend to take trips that have a lot of ‚Äúpopular‚Äù sightseeing.. LA, NYC, Las Vegas, Disney World, Miami, etc. where there is just a lot of stuff to get to and you‚Äôre out from morning until night. With some upcoming changes in our life, we have the opportunity for quicker weekend getaways that might not be so ‚Äúthrilling‚Äù (not sure that‚Äôs the right word). I‚Äôm on the east coast and would love a getaway to New England or Canada. I traveled to Halifax for work once and found it delightful but I was young with not a lot of money and I had to work so just being there was enough. 

I would love to take my husband but we‚Äôre just not great at places that have a slower pace. It sounds crazy but neither of us drink coffee so we‚Äôre not drawn to cute coffee shops or good coffee which is so much of what I see people do. We‚Äôre looking to downsize and purge our home so boutiques and shopping are a slippery slope (also, me+gift shop/trinkets=dangerous combination!). I love history so I always try to find something historical to see but sometimes that can be something that takes 5-10 minutes. We do like bars, but, again, slippery slope.

1ko0g5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1ko0g5h/explore_the_baby_trend_passport_switch_travel/,Explore the Baby Trend Passport Switch Travel System review for ultimate versatility!,"Testing baby products daily has turned me into a bit of an aficionado when it comes to travel systems, so I was excited, and naturally curious, to try out the Baby Trend TS06F00C Passport Switch 6-in-1 Modular Stroller Travel System. The promise of six modes of use was a real draw‚Äîafter all, with kids, versatility is everything. The stroller and car seat combo seemed capable of meeting many needs, and I dove right in with high hopes. After weeks of use, I‚Äôm ready to share my unfiltered thoughts.

**Design and Build Quality**

Aesthetic-wise, this travel system leans toward a modern, sleek design with its Dash Black finish. At a glance, the framework looks solid, and it‚Äôs crafted from a mix of metal, polyester, and plastic. While pushing it through crowded urban spaces or lifting the setup to store in the car trunk, I appreciated its thoughtfully lightweight structure‚Äî21.3 pounds for the stroller alone is manageable even when juggling a diaper bag. The build feels durable, though the wheels, made of plastic and rubber, might raise an eyebrow‚Äîthey perform well on smooth pavements but wobble a bit on rougher terrains.  

[Check Baby Trend TS06F00C Passport Switch price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0c99k7sp9/)

**Ease of Use**

This stroller system comes apart and snaps into place with surprisingly little effort. The configuration versatility‚Äîrear-facing car seat, forward-facing car seat, bassinet, toddler seat facing either way‚Äîis a lifesaver for moms like me who need to alternate between multiple setups. I did grapple briefly with fully understanding how to switch between modes, but once I got the hang of it, it became second nature. Quick trips were definitely easier thanks to this modular design, and the no-twist harness feature gave peace of mind‚Äîinstalling the car seat was simple and always felt secure. The foldable size of 24.5‚Äù x 33.00‚Äù x 17.00‚Äù helps to tuck the stroller neatly away in my modest storage closet.  

**Convenience Features for Parents**

One thing parents always appreciate? Storage, and this system delivers. The extra-large storage basket is an MVP in my daily outings. Whether it‚Äôs baby items, grocery bags, or my toddler‚Äôs seemingly endless snack packs, this basket handles it all while remaining accessible from both front and back. They even included perks like a flex-hold cup holder (I‚Äôm guilty of needing iced coffees on the go) and a built-in phone holder‚Äîuseful for quick access during those mid-walk podcast moments. Small touches like these make a big impact for stressed-out parents.

**Baby Comfort and Safety**

When it comes to babies, safety always comes first, and I was impressed by the thoughtful details here. The included EZ-Lift PLUS Infant Car Seat meets all federal safety standards, and the handle transforms into an anti-rebound bar for added security. The 5-point harness feels snug but not restrictive, and my little one naps peacefully during rides. The bassinet mode is soft, and the seat fabric included feels adequately cushioned, though I did notice it‚Äôs polyester, which makes it easy to wipe down but isn‚Äôt the most breathable material during warmer weather.

**Advantages**

- Modular design offers six practical configurations for growing children.  
- Lightweight yet sturdy build for portability and convenience.  
- Copious storage options with access points in front and back.  
- Safety features like the anti-rebound bar for infants exceed expectations.  
- Compact folded size easily fits into car trunks or storage spaces.

**Downsides**  

- Wheels struggle on uneven terrains, limiting certain outdoor explorations.  
- Setup instructions for configuration changes can feel complicated initially.  
- The polyester material could retain heat in warmer temperatures.

**Market Rivals**

Discussing alternatives is crucial because there are other strong contenders in this category. Graco Modes Pramette Travel System popped up on my radar as a competitor, offering similar modular functionalities. However, this Baby Trend model trumps it on storage space and compact size when folded. Chicco Bravo Trio System offers smoother wheel performance but lacks the handy anti-rebound bar feature of the EZ-Lift car seat. Each choice has valid trade-offs, but where this model shines is in combining versatility with practical extras every parent will appreciate.

**Value for Money**

Assessing cost efficiency, this travel system delivers respectable value for its price point. It‚Äôs an investment, but if you factor in the six configurations, the longevity from infancy to toddlerhood, and the included safety upgrades, the expenditure feels justified. Considering other systems might require additional purchases for extended use, this one manages to pack everything into one neat bundle‚Äîideal for budget-conscious parents who love thoughtful design.

¬†A basic Wiki is now [here](https://slimwiki.com/ragnaroknrol-limited/getting-started/welcome).

*NOOOOOOO!*

I am out the door at a speed that is quite frankly inhuman. I don‚Äôt care. Behind me I hear the start of two people crying so hard it could be called wailing. One of them I know is a banshee that only cries for those who are loved. She is holding on to my best friend‚Äôs girlfriend. FUCKFUCKFUCK.

I look around and I see a crowd gathering near Connie‚Äôs tree. A car has hit it. That isn‚Äôt what the crowd is around. I see blood and Connie is screaming for help.¬† She‚Äôs safe.¬† Good, on the fence is someone that isn‚Äôt.¬† I can see her red hair from here.¬† *NO!*

Turning back to the people inside, ‚ÄúCall 911, tell them EMTs needed. A car hit...‚Äù. I choke on her name.¬†¬† I think they all feel my terror as I can‚Äôt say who it is.

I move.¬† I am there within three strides, and I look around. On the fence, as if stuck there is Jackie. Connie is right there with her, kneeling and putting pressure on a wound where an iron fence has impaled Jackie‚Äôs side. I can see part of the fence in front of her.¬† Through her‚Ä¶There is so much blood everywhere.

‚ÄúGET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!‚Äù¬† My voice does not carry like normal. It is well beyond what it should be. The people that are gawking move fast. One man doesn‚Äôt and instead comes up with me. He begins checking her pulse and has Connie push on a spot to slow down the bleeding while he begins checking her for other injuries.

‚ÄúAre you a doctor?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I just happened to be here. She‚Äôs been impaled by that fence.¬† Missed a bunch of things, but internal bleeding will be a thing.¬† She pushed this young lady out of the way and the car sideswiped her. If she hadn‚Äôt jumped in like they probably would have hit the tree dead on and pinned the girl, killing her.¬† Considering their lack of seat belts, we‚Äôd have 3 or four people dying instead of the one. That means triage. Triage means choosing who dies‚Ä¶¬† She saved a lot of people at the cost of...‚Äù¬†¬† *NO!*

My look causes him to shift his gaze and he doubles his efforts on her.¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there are any spinal injuries but this isn‚Äôt good.¬† She‚Äôs stuck to the fence, pulling her off means the bleeding gets much worse fast along with damaging her further, and she‚Äôs already lost a lot of blood. It‚Äôll kill her. But we have to move her fast and can‚Äôt remove the metal fence post that is through her.

I hear the emergency vehicle getting closer. I look at the doctor.¬† ‚ÄúYou save her, coffee is free for you for the rest of your life.‚Äù¬† *I can‚Äôt. I just can‚Äôt.*¬†

*I can‚Äôt lose her.*¬†

*Please, no*.¬†

I see Fiadh holding Cindy, wailing in the lot.¬† *A Banshee is wailing for Jackie.¬† ‚ÄúCan this fate be avoided?‚Äù¬† She said no.*

He nods and keeps doing what he can for her.¬† ‚ÄúWe need to cut the fence and keep this piece in her to minimize the bleeding. It is going to take too long, there is no way the EMTS can get her unstuck before she bleeds out‚Ä¶‚Äù

I walk behind where she is stuck, grab the metal and get a feeling. This is my fence.¬† MINE.¬† I can feel where it bent and where it is weak.¬† It does as I will.

‚ÄúConnie, you need to catch her.‚Äù¬† She nods and is in position without hesitation.¬† I grab the fence with both hands, now getting covered in her blood, and start applying force.¬† ‚ÄúYOU WILL LET GO YOU FUCKING FENCE!‚Äù¬† The metal snaps instantly.¬† We lay her down, the blood getting in her hair.¬† Her hair is matted and it is all I can think about.¬†

He stares at me. He‚Äôs just staring.

‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT STOP!‚Äù¬† He appears to return to his senses and starts helping Connie with holding her insides inside her.

The EMTs arrive.¬† ‚ÄúWe need room.‚Äù¬† They set to work. The Doc saves them time with all the info he has gathered up to now.¬† The EMT in charge looks grim but is all business.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, we need to take her to the ER, you need to let go of her hand, miss.‚Äù¬† An EMT with startling green eyes looks directly in mine and brings me back to reality.

Oh.¬† When did I start holding her hand?

‚ÄúI am her medical power of attorney. I am coming with you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLady, we need to get her there asap. She has lost a lot of blood and we‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShe is AB+. I can give her blood on the way. I have a blood donor card, even.¬† Just jab me after we got her in and hook her up!‚Äù

They are moving her and the EMT with the green eyes nods. We get her on a gurney and are driving down while I am getting set up to give her blood. Everyone at the shop is outside, many holding each other.  I think they are all grieving.  *No!!!*  I realize at that point I just abandoned my business.¬† I don‚Äôt give a single fuck.

‚ÄúPulse is erratic.‚Äù

Beep. Beep.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Beeep.

‚ÄúFiadh, you better be wrong‚Ä¶‚Äù

She is laying there. My best friend. Bleeding out. Her bright red hair matted with her own blood. I am hooked up to her and they are pumping my blood into her as fast as it can go while the siren blares.

‚ÄúBlood pressure is too low. She‚Äôs lost so much blood.‚Äù¬† The EMT with the bright and kind green eyes is looking at me and I can see his sorrow.¬† He isn‚Äôt saying this for anyone but me.

I can hear the machine going. Her heartbeat is slowing down.¬† I can feel it in her hand.

Beep.¬† Beep.¬†¬†¬† Beeeeeep. Beep.¬†¬†¬†¬† Beeeeeeep.

‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll fucking save her! ‚Äú

‚ÄúFucking fight, you bitch. FIGHT!¬† YOU HAVE NEVER RUN FROM ANYTHING IN YOUR GOD DAMN LIFE EVER!!!¬† YOU STILL HAVE THINGS TO DO!¬† WE NEVER GOT A KISS‚Ä¶‚Äù

I can hear the EMT gasp at that. I think he‚Äôs crying. No, you don‚Äôt get to. She isn‚Äôt leaving me.

‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT YOU DARE RUN FROM ME NOW.¬† FIGHT, GOD DAMN YOU!!¬† FIGHT!¬† FIIIIIIIIIIIGHT!‚Äù¬† I close my eyes as I hold her now lifeless hand.¬† She is leaving me.¬† My Jackie is leaving me.

In my mind I see her. She is floating above her body. And I see the god of death, Thanatos, taking her hand. I grab it from him. ‚ÄúFuck you!¬† You are not taking her!¬† Fight me.¬† She isn‚Äôt yours, SHE‚ÄôS MINE!‚Äù

He looks at her.¬† Almost as if asking her if she wants to go.

She shakes her head. ‚ÄúYou heard my lady.¬† To quote Cap, ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt hear no bell.‚Äô¬† I am not running away‚Ä¶ I still haven‚Äôt gotten a kiss.¬† I want that kiss more than anything.‚Äù¬†

She looks sad.¬† ‚ÄúSorry, not today. I won‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt leave her.‚Äù

¬†

He lets her go and nods at me.¬† I hear him say ‚ÄúYou have met the requirements.¬† The Three Queens would hound me until the end of eternity if I took her from you.‚Äù

He leaves.

She smiles at me as she begins drifting down to herself.¬† ‚ÄúYours, huh?‚Äù

Great, even while dying she just has to fucking flirt with me.

¬†

Beeep.¬†¬† Beeeeeeeeep.

¬†

‚ÄúHoly fuck she‚Äôs back. Okay. I think we can stabilize her.‚Äù¬† He yells over me. ‚ÄúLIGHTS BACK ON, HOW LONG UNTIL WE ARE THERE?‚Äù

They turned off the lights?

Beep. Beeep.

¬†

The sirens turn back on.

¬†

‚Äú2 minutes!‚Äù

¬†

Beep. Beeep.

¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a fighter. She wasn‚Äôt going to let something like a car hitting her stop her.‚Äù¬† I have snot all over me, I can see almost nothing, but I see her breathing. I am getting a little woozy. Must be all the blood I am giving her. This is fine.

Beep beeep.

Here‚Äôs hoping all of that was my imagination, cuz otherwise, I am so fucked.

**December 17**

I get a call at 3:45 am. Caller ID says ‚ÄúTonya.‚Äù¬† Jackie‚Äôs mom.¬† I pick up as soon as my brain registers the name.

‚ÄúIs she okay?‚Äù¬† My voice is rough.¬† I need to drink water.

‚ÄúShe is asking if Connie is okay.‚Äù¬† Tonya is obviously crying. She also sounds so happy. Her kid woke up after being unconscious 2 days and not only is she talking, but she is asking if someone else is okay‚Ä¶ I would be too. Hell, I totally am too.¬† I gotta not let her hear me crying too.

‚ÄúTell her Connie is fine, thanks to her. Some scars but won‚Äôt be dying anytime soon.‚Äù¬† By scars I meant the tree.¬† Connie is tied to it, if Jackie hadn‚Äôt caused the driver to notice them and try to avoid them, the tree likely would have been snapped in half by the head on collision and killed.¬† And along with it, Connie.¬† Instead, Jackie got sent into the fence, impaled, and died.

‚ÄúI can hear you on speaker‚Ä¶‚Äù. Jackie sounds terrible. Her voice is hoarse. But she is alive now.¬† She wasn‚Äôt for like 30 seconds.

‚ÄúI owe a doctor and an EMT coffee for life.¬† A bargain.¬† I can wake up your dad.¬† He will want to know.‚Äù

Tonya cuts me off. ‚ÄúNo, Bob has been awake almost 2 days straight. Let him rest. Just like you should, dear.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam. We will be there when they allow visitors. Jackie, everyone is worried about you. Everything is taken care of.¬† You have 2 weeks off to recover, more if you need, with pay, I happen to know your boss and it is fine. I will let your friends all know you are awake. I know Cindy and Ricardo are both super worried.‚Äù¬† She chuckled at the know her boss joke.

‚ÄúRicardo your boyfriend, Jackie?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo mom, Ricardo is Pat‚Äôs boyfriend, but‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶ Cindy is my girlfriend‚Ä¶‚Äù The phone line clicks out. I am sad I missed out on the juicy coming out part.

‚ÄúI send a text to our group chat I named ‚ÄúPat says No Foursomes‚Äù and let them know she is awake and okay. Cindy immediately responds. ‚ÄúThank God!‚Äù¬†

I‚Äôd like to say that too, but I am more terrified at the fact that it was confirmed that I am why she came back by Mab this morning.

¬†

**Later that day**

‚ÄúHey Spitfire, these are from the landlord, Skerrit.¬† He says hi.‚Äù¬† I hand her some flowers.¬† ‚ÄúYou already saw the ones from the shop and Cindy will be, oh hey, there you are.‚Äù

Cindy walks in and looks a little worried.¬† I can tell she wants to jump onto Jackie but she keeps looking at her parents and trying to behave. Oh‚Ä¶. Jackie looks at her and smiles.¬† ‚ÄúNo kiss?‚Äù

Cindy nearly launches herself at Jackie.¬† Her next sentence is almost indecipherable.¬† I catch ‚ÄúIdidn‚Äôtwannaoutyouiftheydidn‚Äôtknowand‚Äù before she buries her head in Jackie‚Äôs hair. I smile.

Jackie looks at me. ‚ÄúNo kiss?‚Äù

I laugh and walk over. I kiss her on the cheek and touch foreheads with her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever scare me like that again.‚Äù

She nods a little. ‚ÄúWas SHE crying?‚Äù¬† It is barely a whisper.

I nod. We both know who she means.¬† Cindy quietly says up, ‚ÄúShe held me.‚Äù¬† I add, ‚ÄúShe kept your gal sane while Connie, that doctor and I tried to save you.‚Äù

She pulls me a little closer and whispers so quietly I can barely hear her with my ear next to her lips. ‚ÄúYours, huh?¬† I won‚Äôt tell Cindy.‚Äù¬† Her voice is shaky.

I believe I am well and truly fucked now.

She is starting to cry. ‚ÄúI am so sorry.‚Äù

I pull away.

‚ÄúWhy sweetie?‚Äù

Her tears are flowing without hint of stopping. ‚ÄúI am so sorry‚Ä¶ I saw the car heading for Connie. I couldn‚Äôt. I just couldn‚Äôt lose a friend like that. I didn‚Äôt think and I scared you, Cindy, mom, and dad and‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you are alive and healing. That‚Äôs all that matters. They will let you out in a few days. You will also have an awesome scar on your side.¬† Glad it was a small puncture wound and not massive. Everything should be okay in a few months.‚Äù

I turn toward Tonya, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam you are welcome to stay as long as you need at our home. I can crash at Ricardo‚Äôs for a little bit so you both have a bed and can stay with her.‚Äù¬† I look at Jackie‚Äôs parents and I can tell where she got what. Her mom‚Äôs hair may be going silver, but the red is still a fire that won‚Äôt go out. Her dad looks at me and grins. ‚ÄúYou just want an excuse to stay at his place, dontcha?¬† Can‚Äôt be getting some with old people around.‚Äù

Cindy pipes up. ‚ÄúLike that would stop us or them.‚Äù

‚ÄúCINDY!!‚Äù

‚ÄúJACKIE!‚Äù

‚ÄúI am pretty sure anything like that would be advised against.‚Äù¬† Jackie sounds almost dejected.

Tonya looks at her daughter.¬† ‚ÄúCould you two please let me live with the illusion that my daughter has not had sex?‚Äù

Bob laughs.¬† ‚ÄúYou literally caught her riding that boy in high school. That ship has sailed‚Ä¶ I am just glad he was using a condom and I wasn‚Äôt the one that saw that.‚Äù¬† Both Jackie and her mother turn bright red.

I cannot help myself.¬† ‚ÄúSmarter than my first guy‚Ä¶‚Äù

Everyone looks at me.¬† I shrug.¬†

Tonya folds her arms.¬† ‚ÄúPlease do go on.‚Äù

‚ÄúUse protection, kids, otherwise you get to learn if what your mom calls your birthing hips work as advertised.‚Äù¬† They stare.¬† I sit down and pull out my phone, signaling I will not be entertaining any more questions on the matter.¬†

I find out I will be doing so anyway when Tonya grabs my hand and pulls me out of the room and into the hallway.

‚ÄúI did not see any evidence, nor was I told of you having a child with you.‚Äù¬† She seems really distressed.¬† Oh, she thinks I lost her.¬† I put my hand up.

‚ÄúI gave her up for adoption when I realized it wouldn‚Äôt be good for her to stay.¬† I want the best for her.¬† I just happen to not be it.¬† Riley has a nice family and they love her dearly. She turns 8 in January.‚Äù¬†

This woman has now gotten more info out of me than people that have known me for years.¬† I need to be careful around her.¬† I thought Jackie was good at this. She also looks directly at my left arm.¬† Oh, I wore a short-sleeved night shirt the day they arrived.¬† She must have noticed then.¬† ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt be good, or wouldn‚Äôt be safe?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBoth.‚Äù¬† I have no reason to lie to her.¬† She figured it out.

This all reminds me, I should send a birthday and a Christmas present soon.¬† Riley deserves both. Be the right thing to do.

Tonya hugs me suddenly.¬† ‚ÄúYou know, her first question was about Connie.¬† Her second was where you were and if her dream where you brought her back from being dead was true.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe knows she was technically dead?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe said she felt herself slipping and suddenly she saw you.¬† The way she described you was‚Ä¶ something.¬† She said there was another being there.¬† Dark but comforting.¬† He had her hand and was taking her away.¬† You and I quote her here ‚Äòlooked like you were going to punch Death in the face if he argued and told him to leave her alone, she is yours.‚Äô¬† She said he nodded and let go of her.¬† Such a vivid dream.¬† I know people usually have those tunnels they see and things like that.¬† This is a little crazy.¬† But after some of my experiences, I am not sure it was a dream.‚Äù¬† She hugs herself. There is a story here. I won‚Äôt pry though.

I keep my face as immobile as I can.¬† Thanatos was not willing to fight me for her.¬† He just handed her over.¬† I guess technically Fiadh was correct.¬† She had died.¬† While I was fighting to save her on the sidewalk, Fiadh was holding Cindy, and they were crying together. She had grabbed Cindy‚Äôs hand and run out with her so that‚Ä¶ so that‚Ä¶ so that Cindy could say goodbye. And they had cried.

¬†The whole thing about how the triple queens would hound him to the end of time if he refused got explained to me yesterday. I claimed her as mine and ArchFae can refuse to allow what is theirs to leave before they want them to, though they rarely do. Which means Death backed off because I am‚Ä¶¬†

Doesn‚Äôt matter, all that does is that I didn‚Äôt lose her.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúThey were using my blood to keep her alive and apparently the stuff they did to get her heartbeat back worked because she was breathing again in no time.¬† So technically I helped.¬† And I do owe those men their coffee for life.¬† I will happily pay that for her.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe way she talks about you, I was sure **you** were her girlfriend.‚Äù

I laugh.¬† ‚ÄúNah, Cindy‚Äôs super cute and super loving.¬† They are adorbs together.¬† Also, not that into girls.¬† Even gorgeous gingers with the best curves.‚Äù

I get the side-eye, and she grabs my hands.¬† ‚ÄúSo, about family Christmas‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†

**December 19**

‚ÄúTitania, Why are you here?‚Äù

The Queen of Land and Light is wearing her usual style of clothes, which seem far too thin and not there for winter. She smiles at me.

‚ÄúJacqueline is injured. I have come to help nurse her.‚Äù

I blink a lot. *The nurse thing has me thinking of her in a nurse outfit and DERAIL.*

She laughs.¬† ‚ÄúI caught that. Now do let me in?‚Äù

Come in. She walks in and admires the room. ‚ÄúSame layout.‚Äù

It is at that moment when I remember Skerrit saying one of the doubles is rented to a couple with certain tastes‚Ä¶.¬† Fuck me.¬† THEY are my neightbors?!

‚ÄúPatricia, darling, you took the larger room, correct?‚Äù¬† I nod and she smiles. She gets to the living room and sees Tonya and Robert.

‚ÄúWell hello there. You MUST be Jaqueline‚Äôs parents!¬† I see where she gets her hair and those gorgeous eyes.¬† And she definitely has your nose, um‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBob, Bob Flynn.‚Äù Aaaaaand Jackie‚Äôs dad just gave the Queen of the Summer Court his name.¬† This won‚Äôt come back to haunt us‚Ä¶¬†

Titania feels my gaze.¬† ‚ÄúPardon me.‚Äù¬† She winks at me, walks towards Jackie‚Äôs room and knocks lightly before walking in.¬† I let her know that I know she knows their names.¬† ‚Ä¶¬† I know, she knows‚Ä¶ Yea, that‚Äôs right.¬† Well, this could get worse‚Ä¶

‚ÄúJacquline dear, get your hand out of Cynthia‚Äôs pants and scootch over!‚Äù¬† The door closes.

I am unsure who blinked the most at this insane development.¬† It takes me well over a minute to finally work out the needed motions to speak and raise my hand at the same time.

‚ÄúExcuse me for a moment.‚Äù

I knock on Jackie‚Äôs door and Cindy calls out ‚Äúcome in!‚Äù

I open the door and see the clothing Titania was wearing in a trail leading to the bed. The three ladies are all obviously topless, Titania is obviously bottomless, and I am not sure on the other two.

‚ÄúI hate to ask‚Ä¶‚Äù

Titania laughs.¬† ‚ÄúMiss Jacqueline is injured. It was a grievous injury. Laying skin to skin with me will make her heal faster.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat a truth or just something you say to injured women so they will let you grope them and more?‚Äù

She laughs and it sounds so damn sexy I kind of want to get into the bed with them.¬† ‚ÄúIt is the absolute truth. Why Jackie had pneumonia before she moved in with you and sleeping with me made it all better the next day.‚Äù

‚ÄúI had a test I needed to pass the next day.¬† I got a B!‚Äù¬† Jackie sounds like a six year old that is so proud of herself that I can‚Äôt help but laugh.

I am not sure why, but the phrasing bothers more than it should. Cindy also picked up on it. ‚ÄúSlept with you, huh?‚Äù

Jackie goes beat red. ‚ÄúIt was purely plutonic.¬† Well, mostly.‚Äù

Titania chuckles.¬† ‚ÄúI recall your thighs clamping around my head not being plutonic‚Ä¶‚Äù

Jackie‚Äôs shocked face and ‚ÄúLiar!‚Äù make me giggle.¬† Titania is teasing Cindy more than Jackie.

‚ÄúDo be a dear and don‚Äôt rip her stitches.¬† And show Cindy some fun too as she will get jealous.‚Äù I smile at the cuddle puddle.

Cindy shoots me a mouthed thank you and a wink.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure no sound leaves this room.‚Äù¬† Titania didn‚Äôt mean they would be quiet.

***Bitch****.*

I am not sure where that came from me, but I think she heard it. I close the door.

The living room has‚Ä¶questions‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThat is one of our more frequent customers and a neighbor. She and Jackie have been friends for a bit and she came to nurse her back to health.‚Äù¬† They don‚Äôt believe me for a second.

‚ÄúPlease tell me our girl isn‚Äôt going to start bleeding again.‚Äù¬† I laugh. ‚ÄúNo, Titania will be cautious if not outright gentle.‚Äù

Bob looks me in the eyes, ‚ÄúYou know this from experience?‚Äù

I shake my head vehemently.¬† ‚ÄúWe have a no dating irregulars rule. Rule 3.¬† Wait!‚Äù¬† *Rule 3!*

¬†

I stride down the hall in a few seconds. The door flies open and‚Ä¶ Titania and Jackie are spooning with Cindy being Jackie‚Äôs spoon [too.it](http://too.it) looks so comfy.

Jackie opens an eye. ‚ÄúRule 3, we know. She was just fucking with you.¬† Night Pat, love ya.‚Äù¬† She kisses Cindy on the cheek. ‚ÄúLove you too, babe.‚Äù¬† Cindy sighs and scootches in.

I walk back out.

‚ÄúThe brats are already sleeping‚Ä¶‚Äù

I plainly hear Tonya broadcast ‚Äú*Jealous much?*‚Äù

In this case, yes. That looked like a really wonderful cuddle pile. Time to call Ricardo.

¬†

**December 20.**

I am getting to enjoy being the little spoon when Ricardo asks me something weird.

‚ÄúBaby, have you ever wanted to date Jackie or Cindy?‚Äù¬† He whispers it in my ear. Pretty sure all of them are in the living room and since we are being lazy and sleeping in, whispers are the order of the day.

‚ÄúBabe, I‚Äôm like 70% straight.¬† So‚Ä¶ not seriously?‚Äù

He kisses my neck. ‚ÄúCindy talks about you a lot. She admires you almost as much as she loves Jackie. I think she digs you.‚Äù¬† I can hear him smiling. Also, I can feel him thinking about her and me. It is definitely getting his attention.

‚ÄúYea.¬† I know she does. And Jackie likes to flirt and I think she might actually want to date me, but corporate would pitch a fit. I would have to fire her to date her and that‚Äôs not happening.¬† Not going to ask her to quit a job she loves for a shot at me either. Not worth it for her.‚Äù

He snuggles in. ‚ÄúSo, you won‚Äôt risk hurting her financially to date her. That‚Äôs sweet.¬† You don‚Äôt have that issue with Cindy.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt. But she is dating Jackie and it would hurt Jackie if she couldn‚Äôt get in on the activities. Like I just said, I also am not super into women.¬† She has definitely pushed that with me. She would be on the short list of women to jump if I ever got into it after breaking up with you. Which I am not wanting to do anytime soon. Cuz fuck that. You are too awesome.‚Äù

He now has a handful of boob to go with the rapidly developing situation in behind me. ‚ÄúI am?¬† How quiet can we be while I still maintain being awesome?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find out.‚Äù¬† I smile and am already wiggling against him.

¬†

**A semi-short while later**

I walk out of the room in my cat-eared long sleeve hoodie and sweats.¬† Cindy looks up and smiles.¬†

Fuck!¬† She knows.

I look over. Bob, Tonya, and Jackie all have identical smiles.

FUCK. Tonya is blushing.¬† Ugh.

I whistle and head to the bathroom to make sure I can avoid a UTI.¬† As the door closes Jackie says in a stage whisper so I can hear.

‚ÄúCalled it. Pay up, bitches.‚Äù

We apparently were not that quiet‚Ä¶

1ko0d1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1ko0d1z/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

My questions are, does it do both?  And how much drip coffee cups does it make?  Also, I noticed that there may be two different types of Luxe Cafes, which one is ideal?

---

If Jesus appointed Mark Twain as the head of an all-seeing U.S. statistical agency, the resulting data would likely be both brutally honest and wickedly witty. Here's a playful and imaginative take on what that might look like:


---

The Twainian Bureau of Divine Statistics (TBDS)

Motto: ""Figures don‚Äôt lie, but liars sure do figure.""

Core Mandates:

1. Truth with a Drawl
Every statistic would come with context, humor, and a jab at human vanity. For example:

Percentage of Americans who believe they‚Äôre above average intelligence: 87%
Twain‚Äôs footnote: ‚ÄúAstonishing, considering the average hasn‚Äôt budged in 200 years.‚Äù



2. Sin Metrics
With God‚Äôs blessing, Twain might offer weekly sin tallies:

National Envy Index: 76/100 during awards season.

Pride per Capita: Highest in tech CEOs and pastors with book deals.



3. Government Transparency (Twain Style)
Budget reports might read:

Defense Spending: ‚ÄúWe spent a fortune preparing for wars we never wanted to win.‚Äù

Education Funding: ‚ÄúEnough to teach reading; not enough to teach thinking.‚Äù



4. Philosophical Census
Everyone‚Äôs worldview, distilled with frontier clarity:

42% say they believe in God.
Twain‚Äôs note: ‚ÄúOnly 3% act like it.‚Äù

21% claim to follow Jesus.

1ko00mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amenorrhearecovery/comments/1ko00mu/my_success_story_first_period_without_going_all_in/,My success story - first period without going all in,"I just got my first proper recovery period!! I‚Äôm so happy. It‚Äôs been a long time coming and I thought I‚Äôd share what I‚Äôve learnt and how I managed to get my flow again! 

I had ARFID in 2023 due to anaphylaxis, which made eating an adequate amount of food difficult due to anxiety. At the time, I started running a lot more than I previously had done to cope with a lot of stress and depression, but without being able to eat more due to ARFID, I very rapidly lost weight.
I went from about 60 kg in March 2023 to 52 kg in March 2024, at a height of 168 cm. Unfortunately, I kept pushing myself to run further and ended up losing more weight than I should have without understanding proper fuelling. I developed some body image issues and became very attached to my identity as a runner. Throughout 2023 I had irregular and very light periods, then they completely stopped in May 2024. By this point, I was eating very poorly and over-exercising, and ended up weighing 50 kg. 
I saw a sports dietician and psychologist, and brought my weight up to 54 kg. I had some spotting in December 2024, but only just got my period again today, May 2025, and it‚Äôs back in full force - I can‚Äôt remember it being this heavy since I first got it!
 I will say, I think it took my body a long time to produce hormones after being in such a prolonged deficit. That‚Äôs why my recovery has been so slow - I didn‚Äôt rush into the all-in method, because I value physical exercise too much and it mattered to me that I still felt empowered in my body. Rather, my method was more about adequately fuelling for the exercise I was doing and learning to listen to hunger signals properly. 

These are the things I did:
- when initially gaining weight, I ate 3 meals and 3 snacks in the portions my sports doc prescribed. She really emphasised fats and increasing my carb intake for all my activity.  
- I eat fats at every meal now - chia seeds in the morning with full-fat Greek yoghurt and full-fat milk in my coffee; avo or olive oil with my lunch food; and olive oil to cook my dinner. I also snack on hummus and veg/crackers.
- I have never tracked calories but definitely eat at least 2000 a day. I eat out and do drink occasionally. I avoid processed foods. 
- I don‚Äôt rigidly eat every 3 hours (as some people suggest for amenorrhea recovery) but I do eat whenever I‚Äôm hungry. This often ends up being about 4-5x a day. I have a runner‚Äôs appetite and I just accept I eat more than most people üòÖ
- I ALWAYS fuel before a run. If it‚Äôs been three hours or more since lunch and I‚Äôm doing an evening run, I‚Äôll have some dates. I then eat after a run- often an Up&Go and fruit. 
- I never did cut down on my exercise aside from when I was initially gaining weight and was injured with a foot fracture. I actually did a ski season which is why I think I didn‚Äôt get a period after spotting in December - it‚Äôs a bit hard to replace all the energy you burn skiing, plus I was in a country where it was hard to eat enough fats. 
- I actually got my period back at a time when I‚Äôm running the most I ever have - about 40 km a week. Not a crazy amount, but still more than I used to do with no period. I run every 2-3 days (never back to back) and I never run fasted or in the morning. Most runs last about an hour (and I don‚Äôt take fuel during a run). 
- I regularly walk 10,000 steps on top of my running. 
- I still drink coffee every morning (1 shot) and occasionally matcha 
- I love sleep and get about 8 hours 

Biggest sign my period was returning:
From November 2024 until now, I had so much cervical mucus. My sex drive suddenly reappearing was a big indicator hormones were being produced again. 

I‚Äôm going to keep up what I‚Äôm doing and hopefully my period will come back next month! It‚Äôs pretty cool that I was able to keep running and have it return. I also love that I can be proud of my athletic body and know that it‚Äôs leanness (I‚Äôm still 54-55 kg, as this was the target set by my doc) is the result of running and fuelling for that, rather than being in a deficit. After all, you can‚Äôt get your period back without an energy surplus!!

I hope that helps any fellow runners out there. You don‚Äôt have to give up your passion or go all-in. You can take it slowly and let your body catch up. It‚Äôs also a reminder that amenorrhea recovery takes time; allow your hormones time to regulate before rushing into weight gain that might not be necessary or eating a set amount of calories.

1knzx5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1knzx5f/the_zoetrope/,The Zoetrope,"My brother and I found a mysterious room in an old vicarage we‚Äôre renovating. Since the vicar‚Äôs death decades prior, the house has remained abandoned. It was after we peeled the wallpaper that we found the hidden door. A golden key unlocked it and stale air flooded over us. The hidden room was large. The walls were bare, the floor was polished wood, and the windows had been bricked up. A beautiful hand-crafted zoetrope, with a dull brass barrel, stood in the middle of the floor. Bernard and I gasped. It had intricate designs in faded paint around its wooden base. Bernard‚Äôs face fell. ‚ÄúOh, looks like the animation is gone. What a shame.‚Äù I frowned. He pointed to the long, white rectangular card fitted within the brass drum. It was completely blank. 

Later that day, I heard, ‚ÄúAlice!‚Äù I quickly stumbled into the secret room. The zoetrope was on its side while Bernard crouched nearby. The air was thick with the caustic smell of polish. ‚ÄúTake a look,‚Äù he said pointing to the underside of the base. I crouched down next to him and peered. There was some kind of phrase carved there. Short, ugly cuts obscured the carved letters beneath. Bernard read aloud, ‚ÄúSomething ‚Äì *when* ‚Äì something ‚Äì *Abyss*?‚Äù The last word wasn‚Äôt clear. Was the ‚Äòy‚Äô really a ‚Äòu‚Äô? I chuckled. Bernard grunted, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just, to me this last word could also easily spell ‚Äòanus‚Äô,‚Äù I laughed. Bernard‚Äôs eyes shot death rays at me. ‚ÄúCome on. Please. Why would someone write something then scratch it out? What could it be?‚Äù I shrugged.

While I was preparing lunch, Bernard burst into the small kitchen. I jumped with fright, ‚ÄúBernard, I swear!‚Äù I stopped. Bernard‚Äôs face was white. He was shaking violently. My heart thumped hard. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked, my voice trembled. He rubbed his stubble. He slowly sank into a chair, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy. Crazy! I ‚Äì I can‚Äôt explain.‚Äù I poured him a glass of water. 

After a minute he was less shaky, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what happened. I fixed the zoetrope and thought I‚Äôd test the new gears. So, I wound it up and flipped the switch. Then ‚Äì‚Äù His voice trailed off. His eyes grew empty. ‚ÄúBernard?‚Äù I asked. He blinked and shook his head. ‚ÄúSorry, it‚Äôs just. It‚Äôs just *impossible*.You really have to experience it for yourself.‚Äù 

A few moments later we were back in the hidden room. I was shaking with anticipation as I kneeled before the zoetrope. Bernard wound the mechanism, and with a nod toward me, flicked the brass switch. I stared directly into the vertical gaps within the brass drum of the zoetrope. The mechanism hummed, buzzed and whirred. The barrel spun. Faster. 

And faster. 

Faster still. 

I stared but saw nothing but the white emptiness of the animation strip. A strange buzzing sensation bloomed in my extremities. My eyes locked in place. Soon the buzzing consumed my entire body. The whirring of the zoetrope filled my mind. The humming turned into whispers. Soft. Then suddenly, a distinct voice took shape. It was familiar, but not mine. I faded as the voice forced memories into my mind:

*After my wealthy great-aunt passed away I was tasked with looking after her massive house. At first, I was more than happy to oblige, but soon I got nervous. Stuff kept going missing. Cutlery, crockery, batteries, newspapers and candles were never where I remembered leaving them. One day I even heard footsteps in the night so I called the police. Of course, they found no one. They mentioned there had been break-ins in the area lately.*

*The next night I woke up to the sound of breathing in the deep dark of my room. My heart leapt into my mouth. My eyes snapped open. In a sliver of pale moonlight, I saw a tall, figure dressed in a black balaclava looming at my bedside. I yelled and jumped out of bed. Suddenly I heard a slam. Then a feral shriek came from where the picture hung above my bed. I heard a click and the sound of something whizzing through the air. Suddenly there was a grunt and I heard something heavy crumple to the ground. I turned to look back at my bed. My eyes opened so wide I thought they might pop out. Just above where I had been sleeping, the painting was not there! Instead there was a large, rectangular piece of even deeper darkness. I quickly swiped at the curtains to let in more light. I screamed. The moonlight had momentarily revealed a long skeletal arm. A grey arm attached to a hand with dirty long nails. In its tight grip was a small crossbow. Before I could see more I heard another shriek and the picture slammed.* 

*The cops made me stay in my room as they went through the secret painting-doorway. Soon they called me to join them. I stepped on my bed and walked through the doorway into a small stone tunnel. I immediately noticed the smell. It stank like piss and shit. It was also narrow, damp and rough. I coughed and held my nose as I followed their flashlights. They showed me a small room connected to the tunnel filled with old newspapers, cups, pencils ‚Äì all junk really. A chill spread down my neck. ‚ÄúHoly shit, it‚Äôs where the bugger lives! He still here?‚Äù I asked. The cops shrugged. After they called for backup, they combed the tunnels but found no one. I have left the house now and will never go back. The thought that this whole time I‚Äôd been living beside some stranger. Some ghost. Even if he did rescue me, it makes me shiver. Every night I lie awake thinking about it. I look over at my walls. They are dark and bare. A shiver rolls down my back. Could there be a pair of beady eyes watching me right now?*

Suddenly, the voice stopped. I felt my limbs again. There was a loud *clunk* as the barrel of the zoetrope stopped spinning abruptly. A deafening, disorienting silence pressed tight against my ears.

I was left dumbfounded. 

Slowly, I clambered to my feet. I wiped beads of sweat from my forehead. ‚ÄúHoly shit, it was like a crazy salvia trip. Did you see that too?‚Äù I asked shakily. He nodded, ‚ÄúIf you mean, the thing about the burglar being killed by that crazy squatter? Then yes.‚Äù We both looked over the zoetrope. It stood eerily stillI. Bernard walked up to it and inspected the blank paper. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs thick, like some kind of filter paper,‚Äù
‚ÄúMaybe don‚Äôt touch the magic zoetrope,‚Äù i said, my voice trembling with fear. ‚ÄúOh come on, I've looked inside this thing. It‚Äôs just clockwork, wood, and metal. No magic symbols or whatever. It has to be some illusion. Hypnotism?‚Äù He continued to tinker with it. Static filled my brain, ‚ÄúWhy would anyone want to make something like *that*?‚Äù I asked and took a few deep breaths. Bernard rubbed his eyes as he replied, ‚ÄúWell, why do we choose to scare ourselves? Are we sick in the head? Or is it not that simple?‚Äù 

My head was spinning, ‚ÄúWhat do we do? Should we call someone?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho would we call? The cops? The fucking ghostbusters?‚Äù He scoffed. ‚ÄúAnyway, it may be *weird* but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a physical threat.‚Äù I shook my head and laughed darkly, ‚ÄúNo, just a psychological one! We need to destroy that thing immediately.‚Äù Bernard narrowed his eyes, ‚ÄúWell, hey now, let‚Äôs not be rash. Think about it. This thing is extraordinary.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care! I‚Äôm telling you, it‚Äôs cursed or something. God, I hate this horror movie bullshit. Just get rid of it, please.‚Äù Bernard‚Äôs ears reddened with anger, ‚ÄúLook there‚Äôs no such thing as curses. It has to be some kind of illusion or something. I‚Äôll get rid of it once I‚Äôm satisfied I‚Äôve learned everything about it. Okay?‚Äù We argued late into the night but eventually I yielded. My dreams were filled with intruders crawling through my walls. 

The next morning when I arrived at the vicarage I saw Bernard was already there. His eyes were dark and exhausted. I guess mine looked the same. Dried leaves crunched underfoot as I stomped up the path. ‚ÄúSleep okay?‚Äù I asked with a weary smile. Bernard laughed and handed me a cup of coffee. ‚ÄúI slept horribly, of course.‚Äù Then he looked sheepishly at his feet. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be mad, but ‚Äì I used it again.‚Äù It took my brain a moment to filter what I‚Äôd just heard. It was still the morning. I was slow. ‚ÄúYou did *what*? Again? Alone? You idiot!‚Äù I took a deep breath. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm sorry to yell, I‚Äôm just really worried. This thing is no toy!‚Äù 

‚ÄúI know. It‚Äôs just, it fascinates me. And I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs dangerous. Anyway, if you think I‚Äôm an idiot now. Well, just wait. I didn‚Äôt just look at it once today. I‚Äôve used it three times this morning.‚Äù I nearly spat out my coffee. ‚ÄúWhat? Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted to see what would happen.‚Äù He paused. I rolled my eyes, ‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs a different story from yesterday. And the all three times it showed me the same exact thing. I wonder if it‚Äôs story changes at midnight? It‚Äôs really quite exciting.‚Äù

I looked down at the sheet of paper he‚Äôd handed me. His handwriting was messy. ‚ÄúI decided to write it down so you didn‚Äôt have to use the zoetrope.‚Äù I read what my brother had witnessed:

*Last May Day I saw one of those old-fashioned roadside carnivals by the highway. My dog had recently died so I was feeling quite low. The sinking crimson sun loomed ominous. Red dusk-light twinkled off of the giant Ferris wheel. Next to it stood a rickety looking roller coaster. My fingers drummed on the steering wheel. I sighed. How long had it been since I‚Äôd had some fun? Soon I found my way to the grassy parking lot. Surprisingly, it was already dark. I followed the lights and stumbled through the wide, open entrance. Hundreds of people surrounded me; young couples on first dates and parents with their kids riding their shoulders. Their faces were all brightly painted. The smell of fresh popcorn and baked treats saturated the air. My ears were filled with the sounds of children laughing. My stomach grumbled. I made my way quickly to the nearest food stand. I was waiting patiently when I felt a tug on my shirt. Puzzled, I looked down. A small, pale faced girl with blonde pigtails looked mournfully up at me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt eat it,‚Äù she said quietly. I frowned, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. Eat. Anything.‚Äù*

*Confused, I stepped out of the line. ‚ÄúNow, what‚Äôs wrong? Are you ok? Should I help you find your ‚Äì‚Äú*

*‚ÄúYou should leave. You‚Äôre in danger.‚Äù*

*I blinked. ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù I snorted anxiously. She simply stared at me. She said again, ‚ÄúPlease. You must listen. You must leave. Before they smell you.‚Äù*

*I swallowed hard. Just then I noticed the carnival lights dim. I looked up. My heart plummeted into my stomach. Everyone around me had suddenly stopped moving. Moms, dads, grandpas and aunts. No more delighted yells from the roller coaster. All stood silently. Their faces expressionless. My nerves burned from terror. The girl yelled, ‚ÄúNow now! Follow me!‚Äù She ran. I followed. As I ran I noticed the carnival was suddenly vast and labyrinthine. How had I gotten so far inside?* 

*With the girl‚Äôs help we made it to the entrance. As I made to leave I turned to face the girl. ‚ÄúQuickly!‚Äù I yelled holding my hand out. She shook her head slowly. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave. It‚Äôs too late for that. Much too late. But you can leave! Now run! Run!‚Äù She screamed loudly at me with tears falling down her cheeks. The crowd of carnival goers were no longer motionless. They crept toward me like predators preparing to pounce. I ran. I ran for my life.*

*When I got back to my car the sun was back in the sky. It was at exactly the same position it had been the moment I‚Äôd laid eyes on that damned carnival. The carnival had vanished. What happened that day I‚Äôll never understand. I stay away from that part of the highway. I never look out to the West when I drive. No matter how much popcorn I smell.*  

My heart hammered rapidly. A cold sweat trickled down my neck. ‚ÄúHmmm, well that‚Äôs creepy as hell, glad I didn‚Äôt see that one up close. I wonder how it connects to the previous story? How‚Äôre you coping?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm a bit shaky but fine. I mean it‚Äôs on par with an intense acid trip. And writing it down really helped to get the experience off my mind. I did the same with yesterday‚Äôs story.‚Äù
 
That night I still couldn‚Äôt sleep. It wasn‚Äôt just because I‚Äôd eaten about a pound of greasy fried chicken. I could not stop thinking about the stranger in the walls. Frustrated, I kicked my duvet off and reached for my phone. I opened the Notes app and wrote down the whole of the first story I‚Äôd witnessed. As soon as I‚Äôd finished, I felt a strange relief wash over me. I finally managed to sleep.

As the morning sun climbed into the sky I got into my car. Soon I made my way to the vicarage and walked through into the hidden room.  ‚ÄúOh ‚Äì Alice. I was just moving a chair and table into the room. Should make a *viewing* more comfortable. How did you sleep?‚Äù

Together we moved the furniture. ‚ÄúActually, a lot better. I did a bit of writing and it helped me get some shuteye. Also, I was wondering if I could try it first today?‚Äù

His eyebrow arched and he smiled smugly, ‚ÄúOh, I thought you hate it? Said it‚Äôs evil.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. And it is. And yet. I‚Äôm curious. Maybe there‚Äôs some kind of common theme or object in these experiences? If I can figure the message out, maybe I can understand what‚Äôs going on. What this thing is.‚Äù 

We set the zoetrope down in the center of the table while I sat down in a wooden chair. I took a few deep breaths. Then Bernard wound the machine, and flicked it on. 

It was exactly as before. Once I looked into the spinning barrel, I became paralyzed. Whispering voices filled my ears. Soon a new set of memories flooded my anaesthetized mind:

*‚ÄúDaddy! There‚Äôs a thing in my closet!‚Äù I woke as my son shook me hard. I sat up in bed quickly. I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and stretched. ‚ÄúYes, my boy. What did you say?‚Äù I said groggily. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a thing in my closet!‚Äù My son said in an excited whisper. I heard my wife mumble something incoherent into her pillow. I kissed her head gently and rolled out of bed. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said, taking hold of my son‚Äôs small hand. We walked down the darkened corridor. Soon we arrived at my son‚Äôs bedroom. Bright light spilled out past the open door. I lifted him into his bed. ‚ÄúNow ‚Äì‚Äú before I could finish he pointed excitedly at the walk-in closet. ‚ÄúThere, daddy!‚Äù he shouted. Slowly, I stood. As I got closer to the closet I smelled something. It smelled like compost. Like moss or decaying plants. Suddenly two slimy vine-like tentacles burst through the closet door and wrapped around my torso. Within a second, I was ripped through the closet door violently. The door was smashed to pieces and cut my hand badly. I was covered in bruises and scratches. My head was ringing. I coughed. When the ringing in my ears subsided, I heard the screaming of a child. My child! My son was screaming for me. As I climbed to my feet I stopped dead. There, within the depths of my child‚Äôs walk-in closet, was a gigantic bulb of some kind of plant. It was large and green and covered in fine hairs. From the center of this bulb protruded hundreds of thin green vines. In an instant, many were now wrapped around my limbs. I was hoisted into the air. I screamed with terror and pain as I was slowly lowered. The bulb split down the middle revealing a gaping, slimy pink maw. I bellowed as its jaws loomed closer ‚Äì*

It was like being thrown into ice cold water. I screamed, and fell off my chair. I blinked as my mind caught up with itself. I was back. I winced and yelled as white-hot pain leapt up my hand. I glanced down. It was bloodied and covered in scratches. The very same scratches the narrator had gotten. My eyes brimmed with tears as I looked up at a terrified Bernard. He fetched some gauze and antiseptic and soon my wounds were washed and covered. We did not speak or look at one another. We both knew what this meant. The zoetrope had to go. Fear of it grew heavy in my chest as we were both stared at it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take care of it once Lilly has helped with the appraisal.‚Äù

We busied ourselves with repair work until there was a soft knock at the door. Soon Bernard greeted Lilly and her young daughter, Alison. Bernard beamed at the small girl dressed as a princess, ‚ÄúOh, Princess Alison has arrived! How splendid!‚Äù Bernard bowed deeply. Alison giggled. 

After a glass of water, we showed Lilly around the estate. It was only much later when we noticed Alison was missing. I felt a cold shiver. A horrible feeling grew in my chest. Had I remembered to lock that door?
I ran toward the hidden room. The door stood wide open! Alison was sitting in the chair. She was staring into that horrible thing while it spun and hummed. I ran in and knocked it off the table. ‚ÄúAlison! Are you okay?‚Äù I said as I hugged her tightly. She stared as if entranced; no response. I looked down. Her hand was covered in scratches and blood.

We returned from the hospital early the next morning. Bernard and I went straight into the hidden room and carried the broken pieces of the zoetrope outside. We dumped them into a large metal barrel, emptied a whole canister of gasoline inside and set it alight. 

If only we had acted sooner, Alison wouldn‚Äôt be catatonic in a hospital bed and we wouldn‚Äôt have lost Lilly as a friend. Bernard‚Äôs voice was sad and tired, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. You were right.‚Äù I felt no anger toward my brother. Instead, guilt burned in my intestines. As we stared at the dancing flames, I was struck by a thought, ‚ÄúYou know, I think maybe it was trying to warn us,‚Äù Bernard struck another match to light a cigarette, ‚ÄúThat safety is an illusion.‚Äù He took a drag. The sun rose on a cold, damp morning. The zoetrope crackled and smoldered. 

The wound on my hand has left a scar; it aches as I write. This ordeal has shaken tsomething loose in my mind. Now my fears bubble to the surface. The only way to release the pressure is to squeeze the fear out of my brain and onto paper. But even after that, a residue remains; forever a part of me. Now, it‚Äôs forever a part of you too.

I've been carrying a checkbook around for the past month. You don't like taking checks and I don't like writing them, but until you follow your Visa merchant agreement, this is how it'll have to be","When you started charging credit card fees on everything I grumbled, but I understood that there are transaction costs to credit and your merchant agreement allows it. I'd prefer if you made it clearer than a tiny sign that I have to block the doorway to read, but that's a different rant. Fine, I'll use my debit card. I don't get cash back, but at least I'm not charged any fees.

Except... you bastards charge the same % fee on debit cards! And I say bastards because rather than chew out a cashier, I have politely sent emails to the owners (it's only small businesses that pull these shenanigans) with [a helpful link](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/merchant-surcharging-qa-for-web.pdf) to the current Visa policy: 

> If you intend to surcharge Visa requires that you:
> ...
> * Limit surcharging to credit cards only (debit cards and prepaid cards cannot be surcharged)
> * Limit the amount to your merchant discount rate (MDR) for the applicable credit card or 3% whichever is lowest.

Yet months later, no changes. Some of you have even increased your fees to 4%, which also isn't allowed!

Sure, I can carry cash‚Äîand I do! But I'm not going to walk around with hundreds of dollars in my pocket. Pay cash for coffee? No problem. But if I'm treating my family out to dinner, paying for a car repair, or buying a piece of furniture, I'm not carrying enough bills to cover that. That's the situation a *debit* card is supposed to cover! But if you charge the same fee no matter whether I use debit or credit, I might as well use credit and get 2% cash back!

Listen, I know that processors like Square charge the same ""blended rate"" for both debit and credit, which can make it harder, financially and logistically to remove that surcharge for debit. If you want to have your costs covered for Square's debit transaction fee, you simply have to increase your prices 3% and offer a 3% cash discount. As I said in the emails, that's completely allowed under the merchant agreement. Or you can list two prices for every item, a cash price and a card price. As a bonus, customers tend to be happier when they don't feel like they're being nickeled and dimed at the register!

What you AREN'T allowed to do is list a cash price, then surcharge 4% for a debit card. And yet. You keep. Doing it.

So yeah, because of your refusal to follow the FUCKING MERCHANT AGREEMENT that YOU AGREED TO, now I'm the guy in his 20's carrying a checkbook around. I'm sorry to the cashiers who have to deal with this and the people behind me waiting. I don't enjoy this, it's bulky and awkward to carry around, but if I'm going to continue to support small businesses (a stance I am increasingly wavering on) without bullshit fees, check is what it'll have to be.

1knzm26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1knzm26/calling_women_beautiful/,Calling women beautiful,"Ok, so, I'm a man. I'm sure it's hard to believe, for obvious reasons, when I say that in long term relationships I understand womens' needs generally well. There's absolutely room to grow for me as a human (lots of it) and I know I'm ways ahead of an average man (which is a very low bar) 

For the first time in my adult life (I'm 32) I want to have casual fun. And it seems to me that I have no clue how to.

**Here's a specific question that I have: how is it received / is it appropriate to call women that I meet in public beautiful?** 

I've always hesitated to do that, because it's so culturally ingrained that women are only valued for their beauty and I don't want to add to that. It shouldn't be the first adjective to describe a person.

And I also do see that it makes women light up when I say it. So what's the point of not doing it?

When I'm about to strike up a conversation I do my best to pick out something unique about the person and comment on that. And sometimes I just don't spot anything. And sometimes, I also have this sense that when I don't keep it simple, make the comment unique, it's off-putting to the other person (which would be fine if I was looking for a relationship because it just filters out the people who are compatible, but I'm not ready for a relationship)

I'd love to just say ""you're so smart"" instead of ""you're beautiful"", and .... well, I should try. Even though I don't actually know if they are, what's so wrong with a white lie?

And right now I'm in Spain and it'll take me more than 2 weeks to learn the language (though google translate is often a friend) and one of the ways I'm practicing is having brief conversations with strangers. It's easy to learn this one phrase ""you're beautiful"" and go with it. It would be a lot of fun to invite and go for a coffee/tea with a Spanish woman who also has very limited English so we're both stuck in this awkward difficulty communicating :)",0,1747398570.0,AskWomenOver30,7,0.22,False

1knzj3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1knzj3u/my_uncles_true_ghost_story_revised_and_enhanced/,My Uncle‚Äôs True Ghost Story (Revised and Enhanced),"This is a revised version of a story I originally wrote back in 2019. The original version was a bit scattered and hard to follow, so I‚Äôve cleaned it up for clarity and added several details that were not included in the original, as well as my own experience which took place a few months after I wrote the original story. For privacy reasons, all names have been changed.

Back in the late 1990s, my uncle‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Kurt‚Äîmoved into a house about an hour away from where I live now. I wasn‚Äôt born yet when this happened, so I‚Äôm retelling the story as it was passed down to me by Kurt and other family members. At the time, Kurt had just moved in with his girlfriend Melissa and his young son Joseph, who was from a previous marriage.

Joseph was around 3 or 4 years old when the strange things began. One day, while playing quietly in his bedroom, he started having conversations with someone who wasn‚Äôt there. Curious, Kurt asked, ‚ÄúWho are you talking to?‚Äù Joseph simply replied, ‚ÄúThe man.‚Äù

At first, they brushed it off as nothing more than childhood imagination‚Äîbut Joseph continued speaking to ‚Äúthe man‚Äù regularly. He even began sharing his toys with him, placing them carefully on the floor as if offering them to someone unseen. Strangely, ‚Äúthe man‚Äù seemed especially interested in toy airplanes and G.I. Joe figures.

Soon after, Kurt and Melissa began experiencing disturbing events nearly every night.

They would usually fall asleep watching TV in their bedroom, making sure to turn off both the TV and the lights before bed. But often, Kurt would wake up for no reason in the middle of the night and find both the old TV and the light turned back on. 

Now, this wasn‚Äôt a remote-controlled TV‚Äîit was one of those old boxy models with physical buttons you had to press. The light was connected to a push-button dimmer switch, not the kind you could accidentally bump or switch on remotely. There was no logical explanation.

On more than one occasion, the TV turned on to a screen full of static‚Äîthen flickered briefly to an image of a blurry airplane, hovering onscreen just long enough to send chills down their spines before cutting back to static.

Even creepier were the footsteps. Almost every night, they‚Äôd hear slow, deliberate pacing just outside their bedroom. The house layout made this even stranger‚Äîtheir bedroom was on one end of the hallway, and the kitchen was on the other. In the kitchen, they had a coffee maker with a small red power light that stayed on when plugged in. On certain nights, they noticed that the red glow would dim and brighten‚Äîas if someone was passing in front of it, momentarily blocking the light. But when they checked, the hallway and kitchen were always empty.

One night, Melissa was awoken suddenly‚Äîshe had felt cold breath against the back of her neck. When she turned, the room was empty, but the cold sensation lingered.

Kurt once tried recording audio late at night in hopes of capturing something. When he played it back, he heard a faint whisper: ‚ÄúStay safe.‚Äù He had been alone when it was recorded.

Growing increasingly uneasy, they finally brought in a priest to bless the house with holy water. After the blessing, things calmed down‚Äîfor a while.

Years later, in the late 2000s, Kurt and Melissa bought a new house, this time about four hours away. By 2011, they had a daughter named Lizzy. Joseph was no longer living at home at that point‚Äîhe had been going through personal struggles and was away for a while.

When Lizzy was around 1 or 2 years old, she began doing something eerily familiar. She would often stare into empty corners of the room and smile, sometimes giggling or waving. She especially seemed to focus on framed photos of Kurt‚Äôs late father‚Äîher grandfather‚Äîwho had passed away in the early 1990s, long before she was born. One day, she looked at his picture and said, ‚ÄúHi Grandpa!‚Äù before skipping away.

Eventually, she stopped doing this as she got older, and things remained quiet‚Äîuntil around mid-2019.

Kurt was using the basement bathroom when he suddenly felt a strange presence. As he looked at the mirror that‚Äôs hung on the back of the bathroom door, he saw a shadowy figure standing there looking at him, its form barely visible in the reflection. It stood motionless for a few seconds‚Äîthen vanished.

Though startled, Kurt didn‚Äôt feel threatened. He told me he felt like someone was just watching‚Äînot with malice, but with familiarity.

The odd time when I go visit them, I usually stay the night in the guest room, which is also in the basement. Whenever I‚Äôm in the basement, I get the feeling that I‚Äôm being watched. It doesn‚Äôt matter which room I go into, I *always* have that feeling.

A few months ago, while organizing boxes in the basement, Kurt opened a long-sealed closet and found something chilling: his father‚Äôs old pilot uniform, neatly hanging inside. No one had touched it in years. No one even remembered putting it there.

Kurt once told me his dad had been a pilot, and while we‚Äôre not sure if he served in World War II, it‚Äôs very possible‚ÄîKurt was born in the 1960s, and the timeline fits.

The strange part? The spirit, if that‚Äôs what it is, has never harmed anyone. It hasn‚Äôt tried to scare or chase people‚Äîonly to appear, to be seen, and maybe to watch over the family. That‚Äôs why I believe it might be his father. A quiet guardian, keeping watch from beyond.

If I hear anything else, I‚Äôll update this post.

**Part Two: My Own Experience**

In the summer of 2019‚Äîjust a few months after I first posted about my family‚Äôs strange experiences‚ÄîI ended up moving in with my aunt Melissa and uncle Kurt for a while. I was dealing with some personal issues and wanted a fresh start in a quieter town. They generously offered me a place to stay, and I gratefully accepted, hoping the change would help me get back on my feet.

Their daughter Lizzy, who was now 8 years old, had grown into a bright, energetic kid. We got along well, and she often invited me to hang out and play Xbox with her in the basement rec room. It was a cozy space, but beneath that warmth lingered a subtle tension‚Äîan echo of the unease I‚Äôd felt on past visits.

Since there were no extra rooms upstairs, the guest bedroom in the basement became mine. It was the same room I‚Äôd stayed in before during my visits‚Äîthe same one that always left me feeling unsettled. That sensation of being watched, of not being alone, returned almost immediately. But compared to another part of the basement, that bedroom almost felt safe.

Tucked away just off the rec room was a small, low-ceilinged space barely four feet high‚Äîthe firewood room. The house was still heated by a wood stove, and I‚Äôd often fetch logs for Kurt when needed. But I hated going in there. The moment I stepped inside, it felt like something was watching me‚Äîalways from the same dark corner at the back of the room. It was a more focused kind of dread, heavier and more deliberate than anything I felt elsewhere in the house.

The door to the firewood room had a large window built into it, which struck me as an odd choice. And sometimes, late at night when I‚Äôd get up to use the bathroom, I‚Äôd glance toward that window‚Äîand feel my stomach drop. I‚Äôd see movement inside. Once or twice, I even saw what looked like a pair of faintly glowing eyes peering back at me from the darkness. I‚Äôd blink, and they‚Äôd be gone. Other times, it was just a flicker‚Äîlike someone darting past just out of view. Sometimes, I‚Äôd also hear noises coming from that room. Things like shuffling, faint taps, even my name being whispered.

I never told Melissa or Kurt what I was experiencing. I didn‚Äôt want to sound ungrateful or stir up any old fears they might‚Äôve put behind them. But something about that room was wrong. The guest room might have made me uncomfortable, but the firewood room made me afraid.

And whatever was in there‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it ever wanted to leave.",2,1747398318.0,Ghosts,0,1.0,False

Wrong Place, Wrong Time

\~Joan\~

‚ÄúThis place is... wow,‚Äù I muttered as we entered the house, it had floor to ceiling windows, a fireplace and....well, it was perfect.

But something felt slightly off.

‚ÄúSo... how did you know about this place?‚Äù I asked Rhoda, who sat on the couch while I walked towards the window and stared down at the view of Spain.

‚ÄúWell, this is one of Aaron's properties,‚Äù she chuckled. I nodded, then paused.

My stomach dropped. What?

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt know we're here. I have the spare keys to the building. I mean, why ask when I can just walk in?‚Äù Rhoda said, glancing at me with a small smile on her face.

‚ÄúThis is Aaron's house?‚Äù I asked slowly. She turned around fully, raising a brow at me.

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs his.‚Äù Her voice was quiet. ""What is it?""

I pinched the bridge of my nose, disbelief washing over me. The fuck?

‚ÄúI can't believe you brought me to Aaron's house of all places,‚Äù I muttered. For God's sake, she knows what her brother was like and still she went ahead and brought me to his house?

Rhoda sat up straighter, her smile falling.

‚ÄúExactly why I said he has no idea we‚Äôre here. Jo, your feud with my brother is seriously getting ridiculous.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, really? You think this is ridiculous?‚Äù I snapped, crossing my arms. ‚ÄúHave you forgotten the time we both landed in jail and he bailed you out, leaving me there to rot?‚Äù

Rhoda opened her mouth to speak, but I cut her off. ‚ÄúOr the time we crashed his party, and guess who got blamed for that? Me! He called me a bad influence, told me to stop dragging you into ‚Äòbad things.‚Äô He acts like I‚Äôm the villain in your life.‚Äù I gritted my teeth.

‚ÄúJo...‚Äù Rhoda trailed off.

‚ÄúAnd now you bring me to his house? You really think I won‚Äôt get blamed for this too?‚Äù I asked. If I had known, I wouldn't have followed her.

Okay maybe, I still would have. I mean who would turn down a trip to Spain? But we would have booked a hotel room.

Not here. Not this.

Rhoda stood up and turned around the couch, walking towards me.

I‚Äôm wrong and I'm really sorry. I didn‚Äôt think. I just wanted us to enjoy our girls' trip, and this house is... well, it‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù She gestured around the house, but I barely glanced at it. ‚ÄúI should have talked to you about it. You‚Äôre right.‚Äù

I let out a sigh.

""What next?"" I asked and her shoulders sagged.

""Well, we could still stay here. He doesn‚Äôt know we're here. So...."" she wringled her fingers together.

""We could still leave if you want,"" she added.

""If he doesn't know we're here we could stay,"" I muttered. Well, he wouldn't just pop up in Spain now, would he?

Rhoda grinned, and I could see the relief on her face.

‚ÄúWe're not gonna stay inside all day now or are we?"" She asked, a glint in her eyes. I pursed my lips.

‚ÄúPlease tell me we‚Äôre going to see Barcelona,‚Äù She added as she grabbed my hand, and she nodded a little too fast.

‚ÄúOf course! We would,"" I muttered as we dragged our luggage to the room were we would be staying.

Despite all that Rhoda had said, I still felt slightly uncomfortable. Knowing the house belonged to Aaron just didn't sit right with me.

And hell, I knew something was bound to go wrong. Wherever the man was concerned, something always went wrong.

After freshening up, we decided to explore the neighborhood. At least, we should familiarize ourselves with the vicinity since we'd be staying for a month.

‚ÄúTomorrow, we'll go see the Tower, yeah?,‚Äù Rhoda asked as we walked back after wandering through a few blocks.

I gave a small nod.

Rhoda sighed and tipped her head back, feeling the cool evening breeze wash over her face, she closed her eyes, a small smile playing on her face.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to breathe fresh air outside of New York,‚Äù she sighed. I glanced over at her and followed her lead, raising my head and staring at the dark sky.

Rhoda suddenly opened her eyes, and stared at me. I could see the mischievous glint in them.

‚ÄúThe first one back to the house gets a paid manicure at the fanciest salon in the city!‚Äù she said, and before I could process what she said, she darted off.

A laugh escaped me as I ran after her. But oh boy, the girl was goddamn fast.

Who knows? Maybe I would enjoy this trip after all.

We stumbled into the compound and Rhoda pushed the door open stepping in.

I followed after her but she stopped abruptly that I crashed into her back.

""What's it?"" I whispered as the color drained from her face.

She remained silent and I peeked at the inside from over her shoulder.

And there he was, in the living room, swirling a glass of something dark. Whiskey maybe.

His eyes were cold and his expression closed off as he finished the last of his drink, slamming the glass on the table.

I was surprised it didn't shatter. Rhoda shuddered lightly while a small frown crept up my face.

Aaron.

The devil had arrived.

# Caught In The Middle

\~Joan\~

Everywhere was silent. No one said a word, we just stared at each other. For a minute, or two?

But that did nothing to ease the hard expression on Aaron's face. His eyes just darted between us.

How is he here? How did he even know we were here? Rhoda had insisted he didn‚Äôt have a clue‚Äîshe hadn‚Äôt even told him.

‚ÄúRhoda...‚Äù His voice was low and cold, just as it had always been. He wasn't one to talk much, but once he did, it carried a certain confidence. ‚ÄúCare to explain what you're doing in 'my' house, without my permission?‚Äù

Rhoda was silent. If I didn‚Äôt know her so well, I might‚Äôve believed the man across from us wasn‚Äôt her brother. Seven years wasn‚Äôt much of a gap, but Aaron made it seem like a big deal.

He made everything seem like a big deal.

His gaze moved to me, and I mentally braced myself for what I knew was coming next.

‚ÄúAnd you,‚Äù he muttered, his tone grew a little bit colder. I could practically sense his annoyance. ‚ÄúStill following my sister around, I see.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Before you get this all wrong, I had no idea this was your house,‚Äù I said quietly, elbowing Rhoda.

This was not the time for her to stay fucking silent.

‚ÄúNo idea?‚Äù He interrupted, standing up. And oh boy, the man was on the taller side.

His height could be imposing at times too.

""You want me to believe this wasn't your idea?"" He asked and I pressed my lips together.

There we go.

I drew in a deep breath, ignoring the annoyance already building inside of me.

‚ÄúLike I said, I had no idea this house belonged to you until we were here,"" I muttered.

And Rhoda still remained silent.

""And whose idea was it?"" He asked, his eyes not leaving me.

""Maybe if you weren't such a controlling bastard, your sister would have told you we were going to use your house,‚Äù I bit out.

Okay. If Rhoda wasn't going to speak, I wasn‚Äôt going to keep silent and take the blame for something I knew nothing about.

Rhoda‚Äôs eyes darted from me to her brother. She dreaded him.

Aaron took a step toward me, his eyes grew darker. Rhoda raised her hand, stepping in front of me.

‚ÄúAaron, stop‚Äîplease,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúShe's right. This was my idea. Don‚Äôt take it out on her.‚Äù

She took a step closer to him while I took one step backward.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been trouble, Joan. From the very first moment I saw you, I knew you'd be trouble,‚Äù his voice had a chill to it.

I clenched my fists, resisting the urge to go all out on him. I was in his house after all.

‚ÄúYou know what?‚Äù I said after a while, taking a step forward and meeting his glare head-on.

‚ÄúFuck. You.‚Äù I raised my middle finger, thrusting it in his face before storming off toward the room where we‚Äôd kept our bags.

There was no way I was letting Aaron ruin the one vacation I‚Äôd had in a year. I was going to enjoy my trip‚Äîwithout his godforsaken, insufferably handsome face hovering around.

I yanked my clothes out of the closet, shoving them into my bag in quick movements.

I didn‚Äôt care that it was late; I would find a hotel and spend the night somewhere else, anywhere but here.

From the hallway, I heard Rhoda‚Äôs muffled yells‚Äîshe‚Äôd finally shaken off the shock, but I didn‚Äôt care anymore.

‚ÄúAaron, don‚Äôt you dare! You can‚Äôt keep being a jackass to her every time she‚Äôs around!‚Äù

Her voice grew closer, footsteps approached as I zipped my bag shut, ready to leave.

The door swung open, and there they were‚ÄîAaron just standing there and Rhoda behind him, looking exasperated.

Their gazes flicked to my packed bag, and Rhoda‚Äôs eyes turned glassy as she took a step forward.

‚ÄúJo...‚Äù she whispered, her voice breaking.

I looked at her, ignoring Aaron completely.

‚ÄúJust so you know,‚Äù I said calmly, ‚Äúyour brother is an asshole. And yeah, I‚Äôll text you my address in the morning.‚Äù

I stepped forward, waiting for them to move out of my way.

Aaron‚Äôs voice stopped me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not leaving at this time of night,‚Äù he said, not a statement, but an order.

I stared at him, hoping the daggers in my eyes could pierce him to death.

It would hurt Rhoda... But it was worth the try.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said annoyed. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to dictate what I do.‚Äù

His jaw tightened, and a flicker of something dark crossed his face.

‚ÄúTry me, Joan. See if I won‚Äôt drag you back here myself. And trust me, it isn't something you'd enjoy,‚Äù he muttered, and somehow the threat sent warmth curling in my lower belly.

Damn him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to leave in the morning,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not letting you storm off in anger and end up getting murdered somewhere, not like it would affect me. And besides...‚Äù He glanced at Rhoda. ‚ÄúWe still need to talk.‚Äù

With that, he turned and left the room. I blinked at Rhoda, stunned.

‚ÄúDid he just threaten me?‚Äù I asked.

Rhoda stepped forward, throwing her arms around me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Jo,‚Äù she whispered, her voice breaking slightly. ‚ÄúI never meant for this to happen. I shouldn‚Äôt have dragged you into this.‚Äù

I sighed, wrapping my arms around her.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not entirely your fault,‚Äù I murmured.

As much as I hated her brother, I couldn‚Äôt deny that he was disgustingly handsome.

‚ÄúJust stay for the night,‚Äù Rhoda pleaded. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

I sighed again.

‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll stay,‚Äù I muttered. I wasn‚Äôt staying because of Aaron‚Äôs thinly veiled warning or the strange warmth his threat had sparked in me.

I was staying because Rhoda asked me to.

Not because of Aaron. Definitely not because of him.

# Before The Weekend

\~Aaron\~

I was an early riser... Or maybe that was the wrong word to use. I had insomnia, so sleeping was a problem.

Which explained why I was in the kitchen by 4 a.m., fully dressed in my usual outfit‚Äîa suit‚Äîbrewing coffee. I walked into the sitting room, glancing at the windows. It was already dawn. The sky was glowing red, a warning of the day ahead.

Soon enough, the girls would be awake. Speaking of ""girls""... I took a sip of my coffee before walking toward the window, staring down at the quiet city, save for a few cars and early risers moving like ghosts through the streets.

I‚Äôd had a business meeting in Barcelona, which explained why I was in Spain. I was supposed to be finishing up by the weekend and returning to New York on Monday. I should‚Äôve been thinking about work, logistics, my schedule. But I wasn‚Äôt.

No, I was thinking about what I‚Äôd come back to‚Äîmy house invaded by my sister and her best friend.

Rhoda always had a streak of stubbornness in her, but it never flared into anything unmanageable. Until she met Joan. I had to give Joan credit for pulling Rhoda out of her grief after our parents died. But Joan didn‚Äôt stop there. She had a way of encouraging the wild, reckless side of my sister, feeding it like gasoline to a flame.

And the fact that Joan hated me? Well, that was just a bonus. I overheard her once telling Rhoda that I always looked like I had a stick up my ass. She‚Äôd go out of her way to ignore me or start an argument‚Äîanything to get under my skin.

And damn if it didn‚Äôt work.

I didn‚Äôt even realize how long I‚Äôd been standing there, staring out at nothing, my coffee growing cold. A movement in the house snapped me back. My body tensed, instinctively alert.

The house was big enough for all of us to avoid each other, but I could sense her. Joan. I wasn‚Äôt even looking, but I could feel her presence, the heat of her gaze boring into my back.

Closer, closer, until the room fell into that particular kind of silence that only she could create. I didn‚Äôt turn around.

She didn‚Äôt speak. She just moved past me, toward the fireplace, her movements slow and deliberate, like she had all the time in the world. I eventually turned and pinned her with a cool, assessing look.

Her ginger-red hair was piled into a messy bun on top of her head, strands escaping to frame her face. She closed her eyes, soaking in the warmth of the fire, her lashes dark against her pale skin. Those eyes, when they opened, were sharp and cunning‚Äîlike a fox‚Äôs.

I moved to the island that separated the kitchen from the dining area, annoyed at myself for noticing things about her I had no business noticing. The quiet between us was thick, tense.

She stood, her movements unhurried, and walked toward me. Our eyes met‚Äîgreen on black‚Äîbefore she quickly glanced away. My gaze followed her, against my better judgment, lingering on the way her sleep shirt clung to her body, the curve of her legs in those damn shorts that barely reached mid-thigh.

She looked good in the morning, like she always did. Too good.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre done ogling me, move out of my way,‚Äù she said, her voice flat, eyes narrowed in a scowl.

I raised the mug to my mouth, taking a sip of bitter, cold coffee, eyes still on her. ‚ÄúThis is my house,‚Äù I replied, matching her tone. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be in your way.‚Äù

Her scowl deepened, her eyes flashing with something sharper than anger. For anyone else, the look she gave me would have been enough to send them running. But not me.

She squared her shoulders, lifting her chin as if daring me to back down. I didn‚Äôt. She wasn‚Äôt tall enough to reach my height, not even on her best day, but she didn‚Äôt need height to hold her ground.

Fists clenched, lips flattened into a hard line, her whole body practically vibrating with the effort it took not to lash out. It didn‚Äôt take much to rile her up, especially if it was coming from me.

She let out a sharp huff, her gaze slicing away from mine as she moved around the island, heading for the kitchen. I didn‚Äôt turn to follow, but I knew exactly what she was doing.

Joan Madison wasn‚Äôt a morning person without her coffee. In that way, at least, we were alike.

My sister, Rhoda, appeared a moment later, her chestnut hair a wild mess, her eyes heavy with sleep.

I knew both girls slept in the same room and on the same bed. Leaving me wondering why Joan looked like that and Rhoda ‚Äîlike this.

She mumbled a groggy, ‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù as she brushed past me and stood next to Joan, who wordlessly handed her a mug.

Rhoda smiled, leaning into Joan‚Äôs shoulder as she took a sip. The sight nearly made me roll my eyes.

Rhoda turned to me, noticing that I hadn‚Äôt responded to her greeting. Her brow furrowed in confusion, and she just stared at me for a beat too long.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving today,‚Äù she said, her voice quiet but firm. My stomach twisted into a knot at her words. Joan didn‚Äôt even spare me a glance.

I checked my watch, taking a long stride toward the couch, my mind already racing. ‚ÄúStay,‚Äù I said, my tone flat, almost indifferent.

Rhoda‚Äôs eyes widened in surprise, her sleepy expression disappearing as she processed what I‚Äôd said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be leaving by the weekend,‚Äù I added, grabbing my suitcase.

I glanced at Joan, just long enough to catch her tense posture, before I turned back to Rhoda. She looked like she was caught between confusion and mild guilt, but Joan? Joan‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt waver. If anything, she seemed more irritated.",1,1747397892.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
