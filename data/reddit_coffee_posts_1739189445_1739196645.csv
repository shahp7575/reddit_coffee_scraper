**Now:**

Kaeden did not want it to be true, and yet by every passing minute, the daughter of Hecate was starting to realize that Aubrey was not coming to the date she had set up. She had been sitting alone, cuddled in a blanket, the food had been cooling monotonically, like a Type I survivorship curve. Slow at first, and then descending all too rapidly. The gorgeous sunset that had blossomed across the sky when she walked down to the lake… now the stars looked so coldly distant tonight. And the moon she expected to rise had apparently set earlier that day, which was exactly why she wasn’t an astronomer. At first Kaeden had tried to make excuses. Perhaps Aubrey was running late. Maybe some matter had come up. The life of a demigod was one full of chaos; she was beginning to find out. 

To steady her nerves, she had tried some of the soup, drinking straight from the thermos she had stored it in. It was good, but not nearly as good as it could have been if it was still hot. 

“Five more minutes,” she muttered to herself, “I’ll give her five more minutes, and if she’s still not here, I’ll go back.” By her internal estimates, she had already waited an hour out here. Maybe more. What were five more minutes? Those 300 seconds passed by excruciatingly slowly, and as expected she was still alone in the dark. She spared a glance at the picnic basket and realized she would have to do the walk of shame back to her cabin. Everyone would see her, and.. they’d know. And she had put herself out there and everything. 

She could have probably salvaged tonight if she had tried. She could have returned to her cabin and watched *Tangled*, and tried to forget the whole thing ever happened. Her brain, her best and worst weapon just had to intercede. “What do you think she’s doing if she’s not out here with you?” it whispered traitorously. 

And used to answering her own questions, she replied in an instant, “She’s in the Anemoi cabin, surrounded by people she actually wants to hang out with, laughing at me.” She envisioned the scene crystal clear, even if she’s never been in the Anemoi cabin. Aubrey with her damnable cute red hair sitting in a circle with other campers, like every mean girl drama movie. For some reason she imagined her with a bong hit. That’s what the popular kids did, right? Her sweet, Arizonan-accented voice had a sour teasing note to it. “Hah hah, look at that girl. I just said yes to get her to stop being so desperate. She really thought she had a chance. What does she think this is, some  fanfiction? She needs to stop living in the light.” The campers howled with cruel laughter at Aubrey’s mocking. And worst of all, Kaeden knew they were right. Why was she imagining this scene? Weed wasn’t even allowed at camp, yet it still felt plausible.  

“No, no, no.” Kaeden’s timid voice pleaded. No matter how much she denied it, the imagined words stung. She was a girl again, bereft of social acuity, a perpetual target of bullies. The shy, meek girl was an obvious target.  The contents of her stomach, the soup, were fighting to come back up. She wanted to be anywhere other than here. She fled from the lake. She didn’t care about the stupid blankets or the dumb picnic basket. It was a miserable idea anyway. She fled, tears streaming behind her. She trampled the ground, footsteps pounding. Her muscles were aching. The cold wind chilled her to the bone, far different from Aubrey’s warm summer breezes. 

She plunged into the forest. The one René warned her about contained Myrmekes. They should be impossible. The square-cube law should have crushed them. 


That grounding thought managed to get her to stop running. She was exhausted, both mentally and physically. She looked around, unsure of how deep she was in the forest. She needed to get back to the camp proper. She had heard that the forest was not a friendly place for newbie demigods like herself. She would get back eventually, but first she needed to rest. She decided to sit down against the ashen trunk of a mature tree, which she immediately identified as *Quercus alba* if she were not mistaken. Her shoulders felt heavy. 

She snorted mirthlessly. René had also given some practical advice: “Try and get along with your half-siblings, practice, and try to make friends.” In her one month of being here, she had failed everything besides the encouragement to practice. She didn’t know who her siblings were. The Hecate cabin could have been a ghost town for all she knew, and the potential friend she thought she was making… well, clearly, Kaeden had let herself be deluded. Of course she would only be good at the erudite, learning aspect of being a demigod. Typical. Just like last time. Just like always. 

And yet, despite Aubrey standing her up, she still thought the girl was beautiful. What did that even say about her? 

She closed her eyes and leaned her head back against the gray tree trunk. The wind through the trees was almost peaceful. 

**Before:**

Joyce Mack High School was a dream. The school was named in honor of the legendary University of Las Vegas philanthropist who passed away peacefully in the fall of 2024. Conceived in 2026 to meet Las Vegas’ growing population needs, it would remain under construction for four years.

It had been filled with the latest reliable technology, staffed by competent individuals, and designed with a variety of socially inclusive initiatives, including peer mentoring, free lunch programs, after-school clubs, and expanded academic support. As with all schools built in the rising half of the 21st century, it was championed as a beacon of hope, inclusivity, and progress.

Yet, despite the progressive refrains espoused by the mayor, the city council, and the Clark County School District, there were cracks.

What the teachers didn’t know wouldn’t hurt them.

In 7th grade, part of Joyce Mack High School’s dream was tangible. Kaeden had no complaints about her classes; in fact, she loved every aspect of them. It’s just the other students she still has problems with.

Wham! The sound of Chelsea’s hand slapping her cafeteria tray made her jump nearly two feet high. The tray along with her slice of perfectly cooked pizza clattered to the floor. Kaeden’s breath hitched. The noise had broken Kaeden out of her whirring thoughts; predictions on the PowerPoint for the science lecture today. She loved the recent unit topic on food webs. She had done some extra reading on the topic, and who knew that only a small amount of energy made it through each step in the web. It tickled Kaeden’s brain just right. 

“I was looking forward to that.” Kaeden pouted. She desperately looked around for the lunch monitors or any teachers, but the room was beyond packed. Why was it that people always struck while any hint of authority was away? It was an insidious skill of any bully.

“You actually like the pizza here, Hartley? It's just heated grocery store pizza.”

“It doesn't matter where it came from. It's still good.” 

“Hah. That just shows you have no taste.” 

“What is it that you want, Chelsea?” 

“I came to ask why you didn't participate in the All-School volleyball tournament yesterday. You totally missed me scoring the winning points. My team totally trounced on those other losers. I would have loved to see you there.”

“Is that why you felt the need to demonstrate your spiking ability on my tray?” 

“Exactly. Now answer the question, Hartley.” 

“Cause I asked Mr. Case if I could stay with her and do some extra reading. Volleyball and crowds aren't really my thing.” 

Chelsea scoffed, “and miss the euphoria of the competition? Do you even need the extra credit?” 

“No, but it was fun. She let me peek at her old college textbook.” In fact, she was currently sitting at a 87, not the best but it was a good score in her book. “Can you just go? I just want to be left alone.” 

“Sure. But you better not miss next month’s All-School volleyball tourney.” 

“Or what?”

“You’ll see.” The Queen Bee grinned like a hungry shark, all teeth. There was blood in the water, and she smelled it. “Until then, well, enjoy your slops.” 

The girl shivered as the star athlete walked away, unsettled. She scooped up her pizza slice from the ground. Luckily, it was still salvageable. She didn’t want to cause further scenes. Remaining slouched, she trotted over to the nearest empty table. She let long, dirty-blonde hair droop before her eyes. If she pointedly ignored everyone, then everyone would return to their conversations. She wiped off the slice as best as she could, and took a hearty bite. It was still cheesy doughy goodness. 

Despite generally liking biology, she sat in the back row after lunch. She didn’t even raise her hand to answer a question Mr. Case asked. She was too preoccupied, thinking about the threat that Chelsea had promised. It stayed with her through the rest of her classes. She wasn’t exactly devastated or torn up about it, but it stuck with her like a thorn beneath her nail.

“I don’t know honey,” her dad answered after a long pause after Kaeden told him how her school day went. To summarize, pretty terrible. She was lying on the couch. She watched as he was attempting to practice his latest magic trick. It had involved a multitude of interlocking but Kaeden hadn’t felt like trying to dissect his performance. Truthfully, she had been in a sort of haze since lunch. A whirlwind of churned thoughts spun in her head.  

“I think you should participate. It could be fun! And you could maybe make a friend? It’s supposed to be a tournament style, right? There’s only a small chance that you’ll run up against Courtney on the court.” 

“Not impossible though.” 

“It’s a managed event. If things get too hectic the teachers will step in.” His advice did seem reasonable. 

“Not like they did so today.” Kaeden mumbled. 

He glanced up from his rings, “what was that honey?” 

“I said thanks for the advice dad.” She answered, speaking up. 

He set down the rings on the coffee table, and sat down at the end of the couch, somewhat awkwardly on the arm. 

“Hey, I promise that it does get better than this. People in highschool can act like jerks, but one day they just won’t matter anymore. 



Kaeden nodded, her smile not quite reaching her eyes “Thanks dad.” 

“Now come on munchkin, don’t you have some homework to do?” 

“I guess.” 

When the sign up sheet for the All-School volleyball tournament was passed around in their homeroom Kaeden looked up to see Courtney staring daggers at her. With shaky hands she added her name to the list to the bottom of the filled page. What choice did she have in the matter? Thankfully, the school handled teams, so she didn’t have to put herself out there asking people to gracefully consider letting her join. 

The two weeks leading up to the event were a horror movie, with a dissonant sliding violin. She knew the monster movie was out to get her, but it still hadn't revealed its appearance. Every day was just one step to the game, she rather it was just over with it. At least Chelsea had decided to give her some peace. Even with her social ineptitude, Kaeden could tell that the upcoming volleyball game was the only talk around school. Students were speculating on both teams, and who would win. Even teachers seem to be excited for the big day. Though, she wasn’t sure if it was an act or not. 

On the day of the tournament, Kaeden decided to take her father’s advice to heart. She could only control herself. She wanted to give it all to her potential team, and perhaps she would meet a friend in the process. It wouldn’t be all that bad, really. 

“I can do this,” she told herself resolutely while standing in front of the female locker room’s mirrors, “time to face the music. You’ll do fine.” She adjusted her sleeves before making her way out to the gym. 

The gymnasium was packed. So many students were mingling in groups, discussing whatever. And she easily spotted Chelsea, who looked in the element. She even had blue and red face painted stripes on her face. “Rah, Rah, Rah, that’s the spirits we have around here!” Kaeden quoted under her breath. Not like anyone would get her reference. Her dad’s tastes could be eccentric. 

Before she could figure out where to stand that wouldn’t be awkward, Coach Wright blew his whistle, “Alright students! Everyone line up on the wall. We’ll call your name and you’ll find your teammates. We’ll go over the rules, and then you guys can start playing.” Coach Wright was a dishevelled man, with a mop of unruly brown hair, and a cool goatee. It looked like the school had hired him straight out of a biker gang. Rumor had it that he packed a right hook, Kaeden wasn’t sure if she actually believed the stories, though. 

Kaeden lined up on the wall, just like a police lineup. This must be what criminals feel as they await judgement. Picked out by a witness, before the game even began. B-but she was innocent though, right? Chelsea had no right to complain. 

Reading from his papers Coach Wright began naming students, “Alright folks for the Reindeer Team we have Tasha Hendricks, Sam Brooks, Dick Nalchina, Nick Nalchina, Daisy Wilson, and Carmen Cruz.”  

“Bruh! Just go by Richard!” Someone called out, further down the line. Snickers followed. 

The called students were already finding each other and catching up. They had no need for introductions. 

“For the Antelope team Irena Phllips, Gwen Samsons, Drew Hendry, Dakota Thompson, Holly Morales, and Bryce Ellis.” 

More animals were called, and teams grouped up. Chelsea called to be part of the Scorpion Team. Some lowly school administrator must have gotten a chuckle for that choice. 

Was that a wink that Chelsea threw her way, or was she just imagining things? Either way, Kaeden did not like the vibes that the competitive girl had. 

“And last but not least we have Quincy Troy, Lindsey Johnstone, Lexi Marsh, Indigo Schnoz, Harris D’argent, ” 

Kaeden held her breath. She at least knew of some of her teammates. Lindsey was in her history class, and Harris always had a good joke. Kaeden let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. If anything, this was the best team she could hope for. Soon they could get to playing, and the school could get back to normality. Maybe they could actually do pretty well in this tournament. 

“Kelsie Stanley for the Brown Bears.”

Wait, what?! 

 Coach Wright looked up, surprised to find Kaeden still at the wall. 

“I thought I got everyone. Hold on Kaeden, let me find you,” Coach Wright assured as he flipped through papers. 

This couldn’t be happening. Some sort of mixup? She did sign up, she was sure of it. And now whatever Chelsea had been planning, she would enact it as a punishment. Speaking of Chelsea, here she came over now. 

“What seems to be the problem, Coach?” 

“Hi Chelsea,” Coach Wright looked up,  “I’m trying to find Kaeden’s name on my list.” 

“Can’t you let me join some random team anyway?” Kaeden piped up “The uh Lizards?” 

Coach Wright gave Kaeden an apologetic frown, “Sorry Kaeden. Can’t let you do that. It will unbalance the teams. Joyce Mack Highschool works very hard to make sure everything is fair.” 

""But that’s ridiculous! That would mean that if even five more people—” 

“Are you sure she wants to play anyway? She’s always reading or doing homework instead of participating in… anything.” Chelsea’s voice cut in, confident and effortless, like she’d been waiting for this moment.

Chelsea’s remark stung, as it had been designed too. And even if she hadn’t, Kaeden could tell that Coach Wright was just humoring her. 

“You know, you should really stop trying to be in the light. You’ll just drag everyone back to dark.” 

The gym lights had felt like they had dimmed like Chelsea’s words actually dictated reality. 

Coach Wright actually looked furious  at Chelsea’s bullying. Now that there was a teacher around, maybe they would finally put an end to it. The proof was right there! 

“Hey, hey, Chelsea, you’re my top athlete, you should know that it’s essential to have good sportsmanship.” It was a slap on the wrist. 

“Yes Coach, I’m sooo sorry Kaeden.” Chelsea relented, but the smirk on Chelsea’s face told Kaeden everything she needed to know. Chelsea didn’t even spare a glance at her. 

“Now Kaeden, you’re not required to be here, you can stay in the stands or leave. Your choice.” 

“I can watch, yeah, uhh sure.” Kaeden agreed. She gave a beaming yet fake smile. 

“Maybe you’ll be a good cheerleader!” Chelsea's final barb echoed in her ear as she walked away. 

She picked a spot at the top of the bleachers. Far from the action. She was halfway out the door before she even realized it. And Chelsea was right, her mood would just bring the competitive spirit down. Why stay, just to remind herself she didn’t belong?


**Now:**
Kaeden opened her eyes again. She had calmed down slightly. Her breath had steadied. The tears had dried from her face. And she really needed to get back.
The forest was still and quiet, like the whole world had decided to share in her exhaustion.
She really needed to head back before something decided to make her a snack.
With a sigh, she glanced down at herself, already calculating how much shower time she’d need to look remotely presentable. A long shower. A good night’s rest. And never, **ever** talk to Aubrey again.
But then she froze.
Something was wrong. Or… different? Her mind warred between comprehension and curiosity, struggling to make sense of what she was seeing.
She didn’t need to be a demigod expert to know she had activated something. Her body looked faded, ghostly, insubstantial. A trick of the light? No. She could feel it.
She had become part of the shadows.
She and the darkness had blurred together, the lines between her and the night indistinct. It wasn’t just camouflage. She was hidden, completely supernaturally so. It was unnatural. 
Her breath quickened. Some part of her mind could recognize that she was hyperventilating, but that part felt just as distant as the rest of her body. The forest had grown too quiet, the trees too thick, and camp felt like a dream away. 
*""They were right. I don’t belong in the light.""*

I am sitting in the dentist’s office typing this while waiting for emergency care. The dentist has already scolded me for not making top priority of my teeth. 

I am aware I haven’t. I am also aware that having anything in my mouth is a 10/10 freak out and while it’s been ascribed to my complex PTSD, I haven’t been treated for that in about four years. 

I’ve been prioritizing trying to get a neurologist for a rare neurological condition that we know I have in the hopes of maybe getting a neuropsych referral that has had a barrier because I have too much neuro and not enough psych.  

Which means I’ve also been ignoring the herniated discs in my spine. 

But now I need a new neurologist for my other rare neurological condition because the guy I’ve been seeing for 15 years is suddenly out of network. 

And I need to see a cardiologist because my blood pressure is beyond my GP’s scope and the tachycardia is worrisome but no one has any available appointments and I need to remember to call them on the first of the month as soon as they open (even though I am at work at that time) to try to get an appointment as soon as it’s available. 

Chronic migraines make it really difficult to think and new insurance means I am off my Botox schedule with no sign that I will have my Botox or Emgality any time soon which means nearly daily neurological events which isn’t making anything easier. 

The migraines are making my digestive issues worse and the limited food options because of my dental issues are also making those worse and no one has any idea about how to fix or manage them other than that they are probably related to one or more of my neurological issues but neurology would have to refer to me to neuro-gastro-immunology and I don’t currently even have a neurologist. 

And I’ve been crying in the afternoons on my way home from work because I feel so totally overwhelmed.

All of these things are linked to each other. I am painfully aware of this. But I am trying to manage all of this on my lunch breaks or coffee breaks because everyone is only open 9-5 (and only taking calls 9:30-4) when I work 8:30-5 while I feel my body falling apart in real time. 

I have an insurance case worker. I’ve spoken to her once and she has not returned any of my calls since. When I did talk to her, she told me to go on Yelp to figure out what I need. 

Sorry for the emotional rant. I just don’t know how I am supposed to do this or prioritize anything when nothing can be done. I’m out of work this morning, borrowing against fugue PTO because that’s how strapped I am.

Hey guys, how are you doing? 

I’m not doing well, I’m really quite lost and I really feel like I need to talk about it. 

So, problem. December 2023, I purged for the first time. I knew it was a bad thing to do, but I really had no idea just how bad. The TLDR is that I am DONE with this bs, I just want to stop, but I cannot stop. I have been trying, I am genuinely trying. I need to eat, but I can hardly keep anything down. I really had no idea that I was going to lose my ability to keep food in my stomach. I have tried a lot of things. Here’s a short list:
I’ve tried vegetable soup, yogurt, avocado, baby food, Up&Go drinks (fairly high cal), peanut butter, cuppa soups, bananas, banana smoothie, porridge, and some other things I can’t remember atm.
Avocado, peanut butter and baby food seem to be the easiest to keep down, but even these are still causing me trouble. After a while, it just comes up into my throat. I feel like I’m on the verge of vomiting, constantly. This morning, I had about two tablespoons of coconut yogurt with some coffee, and the moment I stood up, I had about a second to grab a bucket and I lost the lot. It’s so uncomfortable. Food sits in my stomach, (or my throat) for hours on end. I wind up just giving up after an hour or two because I just can’t stand the discomfort. 

My doctor knows, I’m seeing a dietitian. They both encourage me to start small with little things, but I feel like they don’t realise how hard it is. 
I’m lucky that I’m not extremely underweight, just a little. I managed to gain a bit, but it disappeared after a week. ED brain wants me to lose, but logic brain knows that won’t make my life better. It’s only made it worse so far. I’m sure gaining would be hard on me mentally, but my health is currently so bad that atm I don’t even care. I get so dizzy and nauseous and sick. 

I need advice. I need some ideas on what to do. How do you stop purging? How do you recover from AN/BP? How do you put up with the discomfort every meal or snack, every day? Scratch meal, I can hardly do a snack. 
THE ONE UPSIDE is that as the day goes on, it gets easier. By nighttime, I can stomach a whole bit of banana bread, it’s the most substantial thing I can have and it’s great. But I need to be able to have something in the morning and day, not just at night. I want some energy to go through the day, but mornings are just impossible. 

You can probably tell that I’m just very frustrated, and gradually getting more upset. I’ve been genuinely trying for a few months, it’s already difficult mentally, but it’s so much harder physically. 
I haven’t told my family, whom I live with. I can’t let them find out. They already worry about me for other things I go through. 
I really hope my frustration doesn’t come across as rude, and I hope that this wasn’t too upsetting or triggering, I wouldn’t wish this on anyone, although I’m sure a lot of you are already going through similar things. 
Any ideas or advice about coping would be greatly appreciated. Yes I speak with my doctor about this, but my next appointment is in three weeks now and I just feel like I’m on the verge of giving up.

I want to start of this post by saying that I'm new to espresso, I've owned my new gear for a couple of days, and I've done a lot of research.

I know espresso has a pretty steep learning curve but it feels like I've been going in circles for the last couple of days and everything I've learned in ""theory"" just isn't applicable...

My gear:
Gaggia Classic Evo Pro 
Gaggia Macina/a grinder
VST basket from baristapro
Gaggia Stock Portafilter (I will switch to an open end in a couple of days)
Solid tamper 58.4mm to minimize gap
WDT tool + Funnel

Over the last couple of days I've learned more and more about my machine. I've learned temperature surfing and how to clean the machine before brewing. This is my current routine:

0. Turn on the machine and let it warm up for 20 minutes, then let it be turned off for 3-5 minutes before brewing.
1. Grind 18g of fresh beans (medium/light roast), I've messed around with the grind size but nothing tastes good and balanced...
2. Make the puck: I make sure to be very careful and gentle with my distribution til I feel it looks great. I tamp as evenly and straight as possible and blow off residue. 
3. Let water pour through until the light turns off
4. Turn on steam mode for 20 seconds then turn off
5. Brew for 25-30 seconds - the amount I get is around 36-40g of liquid with the ""right"" grind size. But it still tastes bad...
6. Clean machine

I get almost no crema and the liquid coming out of the portafilter is light brown and looks like if you had poured milk into it... The last couple of tries the puck even stuck to the top of the machine when I was taking out my portafilter...

The amount of coffee I get from 25-30 seconds of brewing is right but it tastes very bitter. I tried grinding coarser but that also made bitter coffee.
 It smells bad and watery but at the same time very bitter. I've tried doing this with 2 types of beans and the results are the same. I just can't get it right!

Frankly, I didn’t have high expectations given its price point, but this little table has genuinely surprised me. From its simple design to its functionality, it has a lot going for it—though it’s not without its quirks.

The design is undeniably minimalist, with a black oak woodgrain finish that fits well into most décor styles, especially modern and contemporary spaces. The engineered wood construction was a bit of a concern initially, but the table has held up nicely, even when my nephew decided it was his racecar track for the day. Its lightweight build makes it easy to move around, though that also means it’s not the sturdiest option out there. I wouldn’t recommend sitting on it or overloading it with heavy items.

The dimensions—19""D x 39""W x 17.5""H—make it ideal for small apartments, dorm rooms, or cozy living rooms. It’s compact enough to fit snugly in tight spaces but offers enough surface area for essentials like a laptop, a coffee mug, or a stack of books. However, if you’re planning to use it for larger gatherings or to hold multiple decorative items, you might find the space a bit limiting.

Being a hollow-core table, I was curious about its stability, and I’ll admit, it does wobble slightly if pushed hard. Still, it’s perfectly adequate for everyday use, especially if you’re not planning to load it with heavy objects. The surface is water-resistant, which has been a real blessing. Cleaning up spills is as simple as wiping with a damp cloth, so it’s been perfect for someone like me, who’s prone to coffee mishaps during work-from-home days.

Assembly was a breeze. I’m not exactly known for my DIY skills, yet I managed to screw the legs on and set it up in under 10 minutes. The instructions were clear, and I appreciated that no additional tools were required. Still, the lightweight material means you should handle it with care during assembly to avoid overtightening or damaging parts.

**Pros**

* Affordable and budget-friendly.
* Lightweight and easy to move.
* Simple assembly process that takes minutes.
* Water-resistant surface makes cleaning effortless.
* Minimalist design that fits a variety of décor styles.

**Cons**

* Not the most stable; wobbles slightly when pushed.
* Limited surface area for larger gatherings or heavy use.
* Lightweight build may not withstand excessive weight.
* Lacks a premium feel due to the hollow-core construction.

Comparing it to competitors like the Furinno Simple Design Coffee Table or IKEA’s LACK table, the Parsons coffee table stands out for its straightforward assembly and water-resistant finish. The Furinno model, while similarly priced, feels slightly less sturdy in my experience. On the other hand, IKEA’s LACK offers a slightly more refined aesthetic but requires more effort to assemble and doesn’t offer the same resistance to spills. For someone who values easy maintenance and functionality over high-end aesthetics, the Parsons table takes the win.

In terms of value for money, it’s hard to beat. While it doesn’t scream luxury, it offers a level of functionality and style that’s impressive for its price point. It’s a great choice for those on a budget or anyone needing a temporary solution, such as college students or first-time apartment renters. Sure, it might not last forever, but for what it costs, it’s a solid investment.

The features are straightforward and practical. The hollow-core design keeps the weight down, while the black oak finish adds a touch of sophistication. It’s not customizable, and you won’t find any hidden compartments or lift-top mechanisms, but that simplicity is part of its appeal. The straight-leg style and rectangular shape give it a timeless look that blends into almost any room.

1im6qs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/avrillavignemusic/comments/1im6qs1/my_idea_for_love_sux_music_video/,My idea for Love Sux music video.,"It's my favorite song off the record and I know we technically got five music videos from her 7th album; (Bite Me, LIWYHM, Bite Me Acoustic, that kinda cool Bois Lie compilation clip video and I'm A Mess) but I was hoping for more videos with a Complicated, Happy Ending or What The Hell vibe. She's good at music video acting too. This song and Bois Lie and Break Of A Heartache were all single worthy. 

Here's my idea for a Love Sux music video. 

Music Video Storyboard: Avril Lavigne - Love Sux

Scene 1:

Visual: Avril wakes up in a messy city apartment, next to her ex. She looks annoyed and unimpressed. The apartment is small and cluttered. 

Camera Work: Close-up on Avril's face, capturing her annoyance. 

Scene 2:

Visual: Avril sneaks out of bed, careful not to wake her ex. She pads into the kitchen. She makes herself a cup of coffee. Her ex wakes up and asks where his coffee is. She tells him she didn't make him coffee and to ""go home"".

Camera Work: Medium shot of Avril making coffee, intercut with close-ups of her ex looking confused and entitled. 

Scene 3:

Visual: Avril drives a golf cart fast on a golf course, the wind whipping through her hair. She's wearing a bold t-shirt and plaid skirt. 

Camera Work: Fast-paced editing, capturing Avril's energy and attitude. The camera is mounted on the golf cart, giving the viewer a sense of speed and excitement.

Scene 4: Throughout entire video 

Visual: Short clips of Avril and a mic in a mall. She's singing the song and playing guitar. The mall is brightly lit and crowded, with people of all ages milling around. 

Camera Work: Handheld camera, capturing the excitement of the mall environment. The camera focuses on Avril's interactions with her fans, showing her connection with them.

Scene 5:

Visual: Flashback of Avril and her ex walking in the street. Avril looks frustrated, while her ex looks bored. They're walking in a busy city street, surrounded by people. Avril is trying to talk to her ex, but he's looking at his phone and ignoring her.

Camera Work: Slow-motion shots of Avril and her ex, capturing their emotional distance. 

Scene 6:

Visual: The guy leaves the bed in the morning, while Avril stays in bed. He tries to pull her up, but she tosses a pillow at him. He runs away like a coward, and she tosses the other pillow at him. The pillows are fluffy and white. 

Camera Work: Close-ups of Avril's face, capturing her emotions. 

Scene 7: This scene is also woven throughout the whole video. 

Visual: Avril spray-paints graffiti, lip-syncing and bopping to the song. She's wearing a baggy green top and black skinny jeans. The graffiti is a heart with a line through it, symbolizing her broken relationship.

Camera Work: Dynamic camera angles, capturing Avril's rebellious spirit. The camera is tilted and the shots are quick and jarring.

Scene 8:

Visual: Avril throws toilet paper around in a warehouse with her band. She's having fun and letting loose. The warehouse is large and empty, with exposed brick walls and high ceilings. 

Camera Work: Wide shots of Avril and her band, capturing their energy and camaraderie. The camera is static and the scene is brightly lit, giving the viewer a sense of closure.

Scene 9:

Visual: Clips of Avril going over to her ex's place and giving him back his stuff in a bag. She's acting cool and collected, but you can see the irritation in her eyes. Her ex's place is a nice house, with a well-manicured lawn and a fancy car in the driveway. Avril is wearing sunglasses and a leather jacket, trying to look tough.

Camera Work: The camera is handheld and follows Avril as she walks up to her ex's house. She rings the doorbell and he answers, looking surprised to see her. She hands him the bag of his stuff and walks away, without saying a word. 

Outro: 
Ends with her staring at the camera in the mall scene. ",1,1739196057.0,avrillavignemusic,1,1.0,False

And when you spend so much time daydreaming about things like that, when that actually happens, you don’t ever complain about it, you know.

I do enjoy that side of it, and you should fucking enjoy it. The longer that it went on, the stronger I felt, because nobody else was responsible for my success: not a producer, not a fucking A&R guy, not a guy who did these videos, because they were all shit.

You get to see lots of different things and you're awarded many opportunities, that’s for sure....I probably have become a bit more reclusive [since becoming famous]. I think my world, strangely, has gotten a little smaller. But I love what I do, and it's an honor to be an actor. It was my goal, and that is what I wanted.

I was sort of insulted by the question in a way, but not really. So, to give a good answer, I said, 'Maybe it was the year I was on the cover of both Entertainment Weekly and Rolling Stone. That was a pretty good year for me.' I don't necessarily have to be super famous. I just want to keep doing things I like to do, and if that stuff makes me famous, then that's how it goes.""](https://observer.com/2016/08/david-spade-on-fame-fameless-and-why-hes-happy-to-be-nervous/)

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! While I don't expect a college-grade essay by any means, I do like when someone's opening message gives me a good idea of who am I talking to. What I do want to know is how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete in terms of ideas, so don't worry, I am not asking that of you, either! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**.

I thought it's weird, but thought to myself - fluoride is added to water, so what do I care. The routine helped my gums a little bit, but oh my god - my enamel!  
I temporarily moved to a different country and I only drink filtered watered here. It took me a month to realize that something is wrong - once I noticed my teeth turning grey and translucent. At first I thought I'm just imagining things and it's probably an optical illusion caused by the metal elements, but now, a month in, I can tell surely - my teeth have significantly turned grey & translucent - after a month! Probably because I didn't realize I was not taking fluoride - nor with water, nor with toothpaste. And I was brushing my teeth after every single meal, being vary of my ortho's cautionary tales. Now I know to wait a little bit and not to brush it 5 times a day! He didn't tell me that.  
For so many years, but now even more, my diet has been free of sugary drinks - I drink water, and only occasionally tea, coffee or juices. I eat sweets once a week at best, and brush my teeth afterwards. I brush my teeth at work, at the airport - everywhere. I have a diet full of veggies, regular meals, I even tried cutting down on how often I eat citrus - all because I try to maintain all those guidelines. No celiac disease, no vomiting, barely any sugar, regular cleaning...  
And now I feel like crying, because I keep reading that my teeth getting translucent is not reversible. I have a grey smile, with light passing straight through, and it used to be white.  
I feel so disappointed - I tried to follow every tip my ortho gave me, and now I feel even worse about my smile than before treatment!  
I will have to wait a year to take the braces off and probably pay an insufferable amount of money to try to somehow remineralise it, and have bonding added. I never thought this would happen - I always had such strong, nice teeth, barely any cavities throughout my life, smooth. Now they're grey and scratchy - after barely a month...  
Is there any hope? I just feel so angry and sad, and disappointed... I had good, strong enamel, and now it's destroyed for the rest of my life probably!",1,1739195013.0,braces,0,1.0,False

1im6d0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1im6d0j/f4f_lets_create_an_urban_fantasy_epic/,[F4F] Let's create an urban fantasy epic! [Discord][Adv.lit.],"Hey-ho, hee-ho!

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! While I don't expect a college-grade essay by any means, I do like when someone's opening message gives me a good idea of who am I talking to. What I do want to know is how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete in terms of ideas, so don't worry, I am not asking that of you, either! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

1im6bf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jacksonville/comments/1im6bf7/shopping_at_c_b_salvage_etiquette_psa/,Shopping at C & B Salvage etiquette PSA,"I have recently mentioned C & B salvage in  a post asking about discount grocers and others. Since then I've noticed an increase in new shoppers there who are unaware of the loose procedures for shopping at the location. I don't know if this correlation is related to my posts but I feel it is now my responsibility to provide a guide for shopping at C & B Salvage.

  
Intro: This is a 'salvage' grocery warehouse. Most of the items are HUGELY discounted because they come from overstock, damaged pallets, etc. \*Sometimes\* there are out of date items so it's up to the consumer to look for expiration dates.



LOGISTICS: If navigating by google maps its worth noting the warehouse is actually on the opposite side of the alley from where it's listed. The place is run by these two old white guys and a handful of younger men who handle the warehouse work.When you pull up to park do not block the loading dock. This is a company with wholesale commercial clients and they will often be receiving and loading trucks at whatever time of the day.  
There is a door to the left of the loading dock you can enter through, or there is a wooden staircase leading up the loading dock into the ware house. In the warehouse section there are shopping carts in the back which you can use. There are two refrigerators, two freezers, and  a small warehouse full of goods. 



PRICING: NOTHING HAS A PRICE ON IT. If you need/want it just put it in your cart. The price is going to be so drastically less than what you would pay at the chain grocer so this is your chance to pretend youre not a struggling middle class pauper and just chuck it in the cart. For perspective, I regularly by a bag of Organic coffee here and it costs me $3.50 instead of like $20. If you need to estimate your spending then just look at the amazon list price for an item and divide it by 3. That will make sure you don't overspend and you will likely overestimate the total cost by quite a bit. These guys DO NOT want to have to answer your price questions all day. Seriously, don't pester these guys asking a million questions about prices. They're doing the community a favor by even being open to the public so lets show them respect and honor their wishes. 

  
PROCEDURE: Get your cart from the back and fill that baby up because today you're a rich man/woman. If the workers are present in the warehouse be mindful to stay out of their way. That being said feel free to ask them where to locate things you're looking for because that ultimately does result in you getting out of their way faster. You might not be in the way at all, its gonna depend on the day/time. Some days the aisles are full of pallets that just got unloaded and you may not to ask assistance to get something. Once you fill up everything you need from the warehouse you will take the cart back through the front into a door that leads to the office. In the entrance to the office there are empty cardboard boxes. Pick one or two up because this is where your groceries are going after you empty your cart and get tallied up. Also in the office are various household sundries and toiletries for sale. When it's time to pay you will pay the man in CASH.  These cats are old school, like in their 70's, and they want to be paid in cash so that's the rule. 



Here's a few prices of things to give you an idea of what to expect:

Peace Coffee (Organic) 12 oz - $3.50

Cadia Extra Virgin Olive Oil 16.9 oz - $3.00

O California Champagne Vinegar 10.1 oz - $1.00

Twinings Oolong Tea 1.4 oz - $1.00

Conchita Coconut Milk 13.5 oz - $1.00

JASON mint toothpaste (regular size toothpaste dont have oz on me) - $1.00



This place is a win win for the consumer, the community, and society as a whole. It's reducing the amount of waste in our supply chain, it's taking money away from the greedy grocers who profit billions on price gouging and basically extorting American consumers, and it saves you a LOT of money. I have been able to rewrite my household budget since I started shopping here so it's really a blessing. 

TLDR : Don't block the loading dock. Stay out of the workers' way. DONT ASK PRICES (maybe a little but dont be a PIA). Pay in cash. Stop supporting the filthy rich overlords who profit off of selling ridiculously inflated groceries. ",10,1739194806.0,jacksonville,2,1.0,False

I recently took the Big Bus Tour in San Francisco and wanted to share my parking experience since I know this can be a major headache for visitors.

First things first - I found the best place to park is at the Anchorage Square Parking Garage (500 Beach Street). It's right next to Fisherman's Wharf where the main Big Bus Tour stop is located. I paid about $30 for the whole day, which is pretty reasonable for SF standards. They have plenty of spaces and the garage feels safe.

While planning my Big Bus Tour experience (which btw, you can book here: https://advenfy.com/SanFrancisco), I discovered a few other solid parking options:

- Pier 39 Parking Garage: Just a 5-minute walk to the tour stop. Similar rates to Anchorage Square.
- North Point Garage: Usually less crowded and slightly cheaper.
- Beach Street Lot: If you're lucky enough to snag a spot, it's super convenient.

Quick tip: arrive early (before 9:30 AM) to get the best spots and rates. The Big Bus Tour starts at 10 AM, and you'll want some time to grab coffee and get oriented.

Speaking of the tour itself - it was honestly worth every penny. The double-decker bus hits all the major spots like Golden Gate Bridge, Chinatown, and Haight-Ashbury. You can hop on and off at 20 different stops throughout the day, which is perfect if you want to explore specific areas more thoroughly.

I especially loved that you can stay on for the full 2-hour loop to get oriented with the city, then use the hop-on-hop-off feature to revisit your favorite spots. The audio guide (available in 7 languages) was actually pretty entertaining and informative.

If you're planning to do the tour (which I highly recommend), here's a pro tip: book your tickets online ahead of time. You'll save money and avoid the lines. The current rate is $63 per person, and you can cancel for free up to 24 hours before if your plans change.

In terms of parking strategy, I'd recommend planning to leave your car in one spot for the day. The beauty of the Big Bus Tour is that it handles all the transportation between attractions, so you won't need to move your car around the city.

One last parking hack: download the SpotHero app. Sometimes you can find cheaper rates than the posted garage prices, especially if you book in advance.

Feel free to ask any questions about parking or the tour in the comments. Happy exploring!",1,1739194757.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

I met my younger self for coffee today.

We both sat in our cars until the last possible moment, neither of us wanting to be too early.

She ordered an iced coffee with caramel, milk, and sugar. I ordered the same.

She was eager to know how life had unfolded - whether I had finally moved to the city, what I was doing for work, how my friends and family were. But there was one question and one topic we both knew she cared about most: was I in love?

I want to tell her she’ll move to the city twice, but neither time will work out. That she'll land a job at her dream company, only to realize it wasn't quite what she expected. That her circle will get smaller, but the relationships that remain will get stronger. That she’ll date men who make her question her worth, and when she finally thinks she’s found the one, he’ll break her in a way she didn’t think was possible.

I want to tell her that that heartbreak is the most soul crushing thing she'll go through up to that point in her life. She's going to lose herself and it's going to be so unbelievably hard.

Instead, I just smile as a tear rolls down my cheek.

""Life’s been good,"" I say, ""but it’s taken turns I never saw coming. I’m still learning, still figuring out if it’s all been for the better.""

She looks at me, waiting for more. She wants reassurance, something to hold onto.

So I tell her this: **""You are going to get hurt in ways you don’t deserve. But you will also grow in ways you never imagined. Don’t let the heartbreak make you bitter. Don’t shrink yourself to be loved. And most of all, don’t be afraid to start over—you’re stronger than you think.""**

Kup, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, had risen to become one of the best-known personalities in Chicago. Essee grew up in a well-off family and dreamed of becoming a dancer till her father forbade it. Karyn's family, including her younger brother Jerry, lived in a nine-room apartment on Chicago's Gold Coast, a well-to-do neighborhood north of downtown. Because of Kup's popular column, they mixed with both local and national celebrities and political figures.  Karyn was known in the family as “Cookie.”  

Essee channeled her thwarted performing ambitions onto Karyn from a very young age. Karyn was in advertisments for baby clothes at five and a half months. She took acting lessons before she could read. She continued modeling in print ads and TV commercials. At age 13, thanks to her connections, she got the position of understudy to up-and-comer Carol Lynley in a Chicago production of Anniversary Waltz. She also performed in high school plays. After one year at a junior college, she moved to New York to pursue a stage career, studying at The Actors' Studio. During her time in New York, she appeared with actors such as Pat O'Brian, Peggy Wood, and Darren McGavin. However, she wrote about not getting much work, and she chafed at knowing producers were only nice to her because of her father.  

Despite having modeled, Karyn didn't have a model figure and was always struggling with her weight. Her mother put pressure on her, starting her on diet pills in her teens. When she came back from New York to Chicago, having gained weight, she had to face Essee's disapproval. Karyn was, by almost anyone's standard, an attractive woman. Her parents thought she looked like Elizabeth Taylor. I see Stockard Channing and, in some stills, Natalie Wood. But for Karyn, she wasn't good enough. She became fixated on how she looked, and had plastic surgery on her ears, chin, and nose by the age of 20. Weight was always an issue. A short piece in a Los Angeles paper to promote The Gertrude Berg Show consisted of her discussing the importance of remaining slim, and how she learned to curb her appetite by avoiding sweets and starches. But sadly, that does not seem to have been how she did it in her real life.  

Karyn got a bit part in a Jerry Lewis movie and moved to Hollywood in 1960, aged 20. She went on to appear in guest spots on a number of television shows, including The Donna Reed Show, The Andy Griffith Show, Hawaiian Eye, Death Valley Days, and Perry Mason. She was a regular on  a short-lived series, The Gertrude Berg Show. In summer 1962, Karyn starred as Annie Sullivan in the Laguna Beach Summer Theater's production of The Miracle Worker, getting very good reviews.  In November 1962, she did an episode of The Wide Country, where she met 26-year-old, recently-divorced Andrew Prine. The two started dating, and Karyn fell hard for him. She envisioned them getting married. As for Andrew, he wanted to continue playing the field.  

Despite having some mild career successes, all was not well in Karyn's life. Always insecure, she continued taking diet pills, along with other prescription drugs. On November 10, 1962 she was arrested for shoplifting.  She paid a $150.00 fine and was placed on three years' probation. The following year she became pregnant with Andrew's child, and friends took her to Mexico for an abortion. These friends were actor Mark Goddard and his wife Marcia. Marcia, a family friend, had been asked by Kup to look out for Karyn when she first came to Hollywood.   

As her relationship with Andrew cooled off, Karyn increased her use of diet pills and began acting erratically. Her diaries reveal that she knew it was bad for her, just as she knew her obsession with Andrew was unhealthy. Still, she continued. She stalked and spied on Andrew and his new girlfriend, going to parties where she knew he'd be present, hiding behind the bushes where he lived, and on one occasion, hiding in his attic when he came home with the girlfriend. The police were called, but Andrew declined to press charges. This excerpt from Karyn's diary, quoted in Chicago Magazine, shows Karyn's state of mind around this time:   

>  “On July 30th, according to a 1998 article in GQ magazine by James Ellroy, she noted in her diary, 'Andy with Anna. Me watched from hedge. Awful. Nightmares.' On October 29th:   'Andy acting ugly. Complete indifference. Scene at his house. I’m hysterical.' On November 4th, after hiding in his attic: 'Wish I were dead.' On November 20th: 'I’m losing reality'; on November 25th: 'Ate to oblivion.' ”  - Carol Felsenthal, ""The World of Kup,"" Chicago Magazine, July 11, 2007  

On November 22, knowing how upset Karyn would be about President Kennedy's assassination, Andrew called her. (He seems to have blown hot and cold, which wouldn't be helpful to Karyn with her feelings about him.) They drove to Palm Springs with Andrew's co-star and his girlfriend to get away from the aftermath in the media. Andrew told E! Network that he and Karyn parted friends after the weekend. But the next week Karen called Andrew with a story about a baby having been left on the doorstep of her apartment, and needing to see him. He told her to call the police. She repeated the story to the Goddards when invited to their house for dinner that day, November 27. She came an hour late and seemed to be “on something.” They invited her to come the next day, Thanksgiving Day, but she declined. She left in a cab at 8:30 that night and told them she would call later.  

Back at home, Karyn had two visitors drop in, men she had met through Andrew: freelance writer Edward Stephen Rubin and actor Robert Hathaway. The three watched television until Karyn became sleepy and retired to her bedroom. The two men turned down the volume and stayed until somewhere between 11:15 and midnight, locking the door behind them. Karyn got a phone call from Andrew about midnight, the last known time anyone spoke to her.    

On the evening of November 30, concerned because Karyn had not answered their phone calls, the Goddards went to the apartment. The door was open and the apartment was in darkness except for the television. Karen was lying face down, nude, on the sofa. Thinking she was asleep, Marcia tried to rouse her. But when they turned on the lights, they realized she was dead. When police arrived, they found a bowl of cigarettes, a coffeepot, and a lamp overturned, but no other signs of disarray. The television was on at a low volume, there was a half-drunk cup of coffee on a stand, and a towel draped over the back of a chair. There were no pill bottles in the room. Dishes had been washed and placed on the drain board. Early newspaper reporting states that no note was found, but other accounts say that Karyn left a note or even a series of notes revealing her state of mind: “I’m no good. I’m not really that pretty. My figure’s fat and will never be the way my mother wants it. I won’t let it be what she wants. . . . What happens to me-or my Andy? Why doesn’t he want me?” - “The World of Kup,” Chicago Magazine, July 11, 2007    

Karyn was at first thought to have overdosed. Because of the condition of the body, it was not possible to tell if there were signs of violence or sexual assault. On autopsy, the medical examiner found that the hyoid bone was broken. The case was ruled a homicide, cause of death asphyxiation due to manual strangulation.  

Police surmised that Karyn was killed some time after midnight on November 28, and that she had known her killer. This was based on there being no signs of forced entry, meaning she must have opened the door to the murderer. The suspects at the time included sometime boyfriend Prine and the men who had been the last to see Karyn: Edward Rubin and Robert Hathaway. All three, along with another friend who lived with Hathaway, were questioned for hours and took polygraphs. All four were released. Rubin and Hathaway alibied each other and Prine, as Prine lived next door to Hathaway and they claimed to have watched television together till about 3 a.m.  

Another suspect was Daniel Lange, who lived in the apartment below Karyn's. He was a would-be actor and the brother of actress Hope Lange. He had a reputation as a drinker and had told someone that he killed Karyn. Lange denied it to police, passing it off as a sort of joke in the fraught atmosphere the week after the murder. He said he barely knew Karyn. She had been helpful in getting him the apartment, but he had only lived there a few days before her death. Lange's alibi was having been in his apartment with a girlfriend that night. (Some sources say he was out with Natalie Wood and returned alone at 11:30). After this, Lange moved in with his sister and got an attorney; I found no further information about him as a suspect.  

It next transpired that about three months earlier, Andrew and Karyn had both received anonymous threatening notes taped to their front doors. They consisted of words cut out from magazines and taped on pieces of paper. Andrew gave the police 7 letters, saying things like “You are going to die.” Another said:    
“ You may die without nobody  
“Winner of loneliness wants death  
“Until  
“One special someone cares”  
 
But a promising lead fizzled out when Karyn's fingerprint was found on the underside of a piece of tape on one of the notes. She also had magazines in the apartment where letters and words had been cut out. Another sad and disturbing sidelight into her state of mind. Police also looked into Karyn's story about a baby left on her doorstep and said there was no record of any such happening.  

Police interviewed at least 400 people, fingerprinted many, and administered about 12 polygraphs. They contacted other divisions to see if any evidence linked Karyn's murder to two other recent killings.  One was of a woman strangled in her apartment. But no connections could be found. Although 25-30 police officers were put on the case for the first two weeks, and 4 were dedicated to it after that, leads had petered out by the end of the year. In February 1964 the Kupcinets offered a $5000 reward for information about the killing. The reward ran for six months, but no one claimed it.  

In the immediate aftermath, Essee Kupcinet believed that Andrew Prine had killed Karyn and tried to stymie his career. It is alleged that he had trouble getting work for some time. Later, Essee and Kup both believed Daniel Lange had been the culprit. Kup wrote to J. Edgar Hoover asking for reinforcements from the FBI. He was politely turned down; the feds said it was a local case, and they had no jurisdiction. The FBI report said it appeared Karyn was murdered shortly after having taken a shower, and had let her killer into the apartment. As for local law enforcement, they claimed they had few leads. Most of the fingerprints found in the apartment were the expected ones. Just a few were unknown. No eyewitnesses came forward, and potential suspects alibied each other. Police also cited the difficulty of wading through Karyn's large number of friends and acquaintances to find potential suspects.  

Now we come to one of the craziest aspects of the case. As mentioned earlier, Karyn's murder happened a week after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. There has long been a report of a mystery call taken by telephone operators in Oxnard, CA on the morning of November 22, 1963. It sounded like a receiver off the hook, but then there was a faint voice on the line. The operator asked another operator in on the call since she thought it might be someone needing help. The voice then whispered “The President is going to die at 10:10.” The time then was 10:07 or 10:08 Pacific time, 12:07-12:08 Dallas time. The motorcade was en route. The faint voice then whispered something about “the Supreme Court, there's going to be fire in all the windows, the Government is going up in flames.” The phone was put down, there was the sound of dialing, and the operator asked if she could help. A clear voice answered, “No, I'm using the phone.”  This was followed by more whispering of the names of courts, followed by “The President is going to die at 10:30.” Then “The government takes over everything, lock, stock, and barrel.”  President Kennedy was shot in Dallas at 12:30 p.m., 10:30 a.m. California time. -  [Mary Ferrell Foundation]( https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=11503#relPageId=108)  

Both operators had 6 years of experience; they said the voice sounded like a middle-aged woman and sounded disturbed. The incident was reported to the FBI, who interviewed the two operators.  A report is included in the Warren Commission documents.  

But how is this connected with the murder of Karyn Kupcinet? Penn Jones, a self-made journalist and researcher into the Kennedy assassination, who disagreed with the Warren Commission, posited that the mystery caller was Karyn. He theorizes that Irv Kupcinet knew Jack Ruby from when Ruby was in Chicago during the 1940s. That Ruby told Kup about the impending assassination, and his role in taking out the shooter. That Kup told Karyn, who was a great admirer of Kennedy. That therefore, Karyn drove from Los Angeles to make this call at the eleventh hour to stop the assassination. That the Mafia had Karyn killed to send a message to Kup to keep his mouth shut about why the President was killed. No offense to Mr. Jones, who seems to have championed some righteous causes in his time, but this theory does not make sense. Why would Kup have given such explosive information to his 22-year-old daughter? Why would he not have alerted the authorities instead? And Oxnard is about a hour's drive from Hollywood. Why would Karyn go all that way to make the call? Would she not have told someone influential instead? Furthermore, why would Ruby have told Kup in the first place? Do conspirators drop this kind of information to just anybody? Is there any evidence that Kup was in touch with Jack Ruby after 20 years, or that they were more than passing acquaintances to begin with?  If the mystery call happened as described, the odds of its being from Karyn seem infinitesimal. Remember too that the operators described it as a middle aged voice.  

Regardless of its likelihood, this story got coverage, and Karyn's death was often listed in articles about the people who died in the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination – much to Kup's irritation. However, I think we can dismiss it in considering who most likely killed Karyn.  

But who did kill her? It could have been a random break-in. Maybe Rubin didn't actually lock the door. Valuable items were left in the apartment, so it wouldn't have been for robbery. The medical examiner couldn't determine if there had been rape, because of the decomposition of the body over the days before discovery. But this is one possibility.  

It could have been Hathaway or Rubin. We have only their word as to what went on in Karyn's apartment, when they left, and what state Karyn was in at the time. How did they come to be in her apartment in the first place? Then there is Andrew Prine. He was was on the phone with Karyn at 12 or 12:30, but that doesn't rule out him coming to the apartment later. He may have had enough of Karyn stalking and harassing him. She would certainly have let him into the apartment, and they might have had an argument that got physical. These three men were friendly; would they have covered for one another? Then there is Lange; he was on the spot and he did make that “joke” confession.  

In an interview with GQ in 1998, and repeated in the E! True Hollywood Story about Karyn, crime writer James Ellroy suggested a different theory. He thinks it may have been an accident. He points out that Karyn had consumed 80 Desoxyn pills in the week before she died. He cites a book found open at a passage about dancing around in the nude like a wood nymph to free your inhibitions. He says Karyn may have been doing this, fell, and clipped the hyoid bone. Then she laid on the sofa and the drugs she had been taking did their work, causing death. Because the hyoid bone suggested strangulation, investigators didn't focus on the drugs in Karyn's apartment. This is an interesting theory, but not knowing that much about anatomy, I can't comment on the likelihood of breaking the hyoid bone that way. But it seems unlikely, too pat.  

If not for that bone, though, I would be very inclined to consider suicide. Karyn had tried just about everything to get Andrew back, but nothing had worked. She had debased herself by stalking him, and knew it. Her self-esteem and self-image were low; her career hadn't progressed much beyond guest roles in TV series. It was a struggle to live up to what Hollywood expected women to look like. She was abusing prescription drugs. Her diaries and notes she left show a troubled, unhappy state of mind. Finally, she had had an abortion, and the story of a baby on the doorstep suggests that it was in her mind and possibly troubling her. Under the influence of the pills she was taking, it would not be surprising if she decided to end it all.  

If this was murder, the killer found a vulnerable victim ready to his hand. Police interviewed by E! In 1999 still believed it was murder, and that the murderer was part of her circle. They simply don't have the evidence to find out who it was.  

In 1989, Jerry Kupcinet's daughter Kari became interested in the case and decided to try to get to the bottom of it. Law enforcement cooperated in letting her examine the case files, thinking that more attention might open up new evidence. The result of this was an episode of E! Entertainment's True Hollywood Story. James Ellroy also participated, and the episode features interviews with Andrew Prine (now deceased), the Goddards, and Karyn's family members. It was broadcast in 1999. Unfortunately, the case was not solved nor especially moved forward as a result of this project. The case remains unsolved as of today, and the likelihood of solving it seems to decrease with every passing year.  

Karyn's funeral service was held on December 3, 1963 at Temple Sholom in Chicago. The governor of Illinois and the mayor of Chicago were among 1,500 attendees.  She was eulogized as “a woman born to be a star” who “moved too quickly across the stage of life.” She is buried in Memorial Park Cemetery, Skokie, Illinois along with her parents and her brother.  Her headstone reads “Darling Karyn ('Cookie') Kupcinet, 1941-1963.”

1im5xrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_journeymappery/comments/1im5xrf/how_ai_service_agents_are_redefining_customer/,How AI Service Agents Are Redefining Customer Support (2 min read),"79% of support teams are planning to invest in AI for customer service in 2025​, but what’s new about today’s Agentic AI Service Agents? I remember the early days of predictive chatbots from my time at Salesforce. Webchat tools could predict customer questions as they typed, suggest knowledge base articles, and deflect simple queries from humans to self-service.

But today’s Agentic AI Service Agents? They don’t just point customers toward an article, they read all relevant help docs, synthesize the information, and deliver precise, context-aware answers. They can even dynamically translate responses into a customer’s native language on the fly. AI can now; interpret images, troubleshoot issues, check an order status, reschedule appointments and take secure actions across multiple systems to resolve customer requests instantly.

This level of automation translates into massive cost savings for support teams, dramatically reducing resolution times and ticket backlog. Unlike early chatbots, modern AI enhances rather than harms customer satisfaction by using advanced models with low error rates. And for customers that need or prefer human interaction, AI copilots assist human agents by instantly suggesting responses based on previous customer interactions and other internal knowledge sources. 

Despite concerns about AI replacing human roles, companies that have invested in AI Agents are seeing both CX & Employee eXperience benefits. Instead of feeling replaced, support teams are feeling empowered. AI is relieving pressure, giving agents more time for investigative work and opening up new career paths as AI conversation designers, model trainers and knowledge managers.

1im5x3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1im5x3i/forget_everything_you_know_and_try_carnivore/,"Forget everything you know and try Carnivore, please. I struggled for 10+ years and only planned to do this for elimination, but it completely healed me.","Guys, Please Just Give Carnivore a Try

I know where you’re all coming from. I’ve been dealing with this since I was 15, and now at 26, I finally feel like I actually understand SIBO—where it’s coming from, what’s causing it, and why so many of us are stuck in this endless cycle of gut issues, fatigue, and brain fog.

When I first heard about the Carnivore diet, I thought it was absolute insanity. How could anyone survive on just meat? Surely, you’d become nutrient deficient, develop horrible health problems, and end up wrecking yourself even more. The only reason I even gave it a second thought was because I stumbled upon a video by Elliot (EONutrition) on YouTube, where he explained that if you have SIBO, the best thing you can do is an extreme elimination diet—not just low-FODMAP, not just cutting out certain foods, but giving your gut a complete break.

At that point, I had already tried everything. Low FODMAP, elimination diets, probiotics, antibiotics, fasting—you name it. None of it fixed the underlying issue. So I figured, what the hell, I might as well try it. I went full Carnivore, three weeks, nothing but meat.

By day two, my gut issues were gone. No more diarrhea. No constipation. My stools were solid for the first time in ten years. No bloating. No brain fog. Everything I had struggled with just disappeared, and all I did was change what I ate.

I’m not here to tell you that Carnivore is the only way to eat, or that everyone should be doing it forever. But if you never try it, you’ll never know. And I know that some of you are so desperate that you’re questioning whether life is even worth living anymore. I get it. I was in the same place.

At first, I was convinced we needed fiber. That without it, the gut microbiome would collapse. But the more I looked into it, the more I realized that so much of what we’ve been taught about nutrition is complete bullshit. The idea that fiber is essential? That plant foods are necessary for health? That meat is dangerous? None of it holds up when you actually look at the science. And now we’re seeing that people on Carnivore actually develop a more diverse microbiome than those eating tons of fiber. Some of the most fiber-focused eaters actually have way less microbial diversity than people who cut it out completely. People keep saying “eat the rainbow,” but then you see someone switch to Carnivore, and suddenly their microbiome jumps into the 95th percentile for diversity.

And it’s not just random anecdotes. Look at the work of Dr. Georgia Ede and Dr. Chris Palmer, both from Harvard. These aren’t just some internet gurus—they are legitimate medical professionals who have been studying the effects of ketogenic and Carnivore diets on gut health, mental health, and overall well-being. Their work is showing that many of the things we’ve been told about diet are just flat-out wrong. Look at their podcasts, especially the ones with Jesse Chappus. Read their books. Just try to understand what this diet is actually doing to people—not just their gut, but their brain, energy levels, and overall health.

I know it sounds extreme. I know it’s hard. But nothing is harder than struggling every single day. Just try it. Even if it’s just for two weeks, reassess, and see how you feel.

And before you start, educate yourself. Watch videos from:
	•	Dr. Anthony Chaffee
	•	Dr. Shawn Baker
	•	E.O. Nutrition

I get it—the Carnivore community can feel weird. It can seem aggressive, and people defend it like their life depends on it. But for many of us, it does. Some of us simply cannot tolerate fiber. Look at the stories of Mikhaila Peterson, Jordan Peterson, and others. These people don’t look like they’re dying—they look like they’re in the best shape of their lives.

For me, it was life-changing. I’ve been lifting weights for years, but I was always bloated. The first week on Carnivore, my body fat melted away. I finally saw the definition I had worked for. I had way more energy, my gut felt normal, and for the first time in my life, it actually felt like all the effort I put into training was paying off.

And no, this doesn’t mean you have to eat Carnivore forever. Maybe you need it for a year, maybe just a few months. Maybe you heal your gut and start slowly reintroducing foods. But you won’t know unless you try. Just give it one or two months. What the hell do you have to lose? You already feel like shit.

And let’s talk about what we’re actually eating. People say, “Oh, I don’t want to restrict myself to just eating meat.” But 95 percent of the food in grocery stores shouldn’t even be eaten in the first place. Wheat? Garbage. Bread? Garbage. Ultra-processed foods? Full of seed oils that wreck your gut. Sauces, salad dressings? Toxic. But people freak out about cutting out all this stuff that’s already making them sick.

Then there’s the argument that Carnivore lacks nutrients. That’s just not true. The only thing it lacks is fiber, which you don’t need. The whole idea that fiber is necessary for gut health? Outdated. Your body makes butyrate naturally in ketosis, so you don’t need fiber to get it from gut bacteria. People say, “But what about vitamin C?”—but they don’t realize that glucose and vitamin C use the same transporter, so when you cut out sugar, you absorb vitamin C more efficiently and don’t need as much. That’s why people on Carnivore don’t get scurvy.

And for those who say, “But we need fiber for the gut microbiome,” ask yourself this: Does a lion have a gut microbiome? Do the Massai (tribe) have a microbiome? Because they do. And it’s probably healthier than ours.

And I did not even start the whole discussion on plant defense chemicals, carcinogens and plant anti-nutrients, which is probably the most important piece in all of this. When I started researching this, my mind was blown. 

If I can give you one piece of advice, it’s this: Forget everything you think you know about diet and nutrition. Most of it is bullshit. We’ve been lied to about what is actually good for us. The mainstream diet advice that’s been shoved down our throats for decades? It’s why we’re sick.

So just try Carnivore. Give yourself a chance to stop struggling. Because at the end of the day, what’s worse? Restricting your diet? Or feeling like absolute garbage every single day?

You can do this. Keep an open mind and just try it. Please.


For starters, I would recommend the following diet:
- Plenty of butter 
- Eggs
- Lots of beef (fatty cuts and ground beef)
- Salt & electrolytes
- Water (& coffee it you cannot live without, but you will realise you need way less to feel awake)

You will notice that after 2 weeks most of your cravings will disappear, 1 big meal a day will feel plenty, your mental state will become better, bloating and digestive issues will resolve, your sleep will be extremely restful and deep. And so much more.

Around March or April 2024, I started experiencing serious problems with my eyes. The symptoms include extreme eye fatigue, uncontrollable blinking, and the production of thick eye pus. In severe cases, my eyes become so dry overnight that they feel ""glued shut"" in the morning. They appear red and swollen (see picture), and they hurt. Sometimes, I wake up with pain that feels like it’s coming from behind my eyes. Thankfully, the worst episodes don’t happen too often, but the condition still affects my daily life significantly.

One major issue is difficulty concentrating. My eyes tire quickly, making it hard to focus on anything for extended periods.

Here the picture how it look when in bad condition: 
https://imgur.com/gallery/f7jhLrV

*Triggers & Patterns*

What’s strange is that my symptoms almost always worsen when:

Driving or being a passenger – The moment I start watching the road, my eyes feel terrible. However, if I focus on a book or my phone instead of looking outside, I feel better. Sometimes, reclining the seat and looking at the ceiling helps.

Being in a group of people – Meetings at work were unbearable; within minutes, my eyes would get tired, pus would form, and they would feel irritated, as if something foreign was inside them. Meeting new people or concentrating on multiple faces at once also triggers it.

Public transport – Buses and trains are a struggle. Again, keeping my eyes focused on my phone or the floor sometimes helps.

Watching TV – In the beginning, I couldn’t even watch TV, but this has slightly improved.

Lighting conditions – A mix of natural light, artificial light (LEDs), and candles makes my eyes react badly.

Airplane travel – My symptoms become severe on flights.


*Medical Consultations & Failed Treatments*

I visited an ophthalmologist who diagnosed dry eyes and prescribed top-quality eye drops, but they had no effect. I tried multiple other eye drops, but none helped.

In addition to my eye issues, I also started experiencing severe headaches/migraines – deep, throbbing pain that nothing seemed to relieve except a double dose of Thomapyrin (European version of Excedrin), which took 2-3 hours to work.

I saw another eye specialist who checked my eye pressure (16 left / 17 right), which was normal. However, they didn’t perform a retinal examination.

*Impact on My Life*

Because of these issues, I haven’t been able to work for the past 6-7 months. I hoped that taking a break from stress, poor lighting conditions (especially artificial daylight LEDs), and bad air quality at work would help, but it hasn’t.

Before all this started, I was under severe stress, working long hours, smoking, and drinking a lot of coffee and energy drinks to stay awake. I work, or worked as a manager, having a sales department of 20 people. And being constantly under Time pressure, and pressure from higher positions, who are making sure the sales and the tasks are done. 
I quit smoking six months ago and no longer drink alcohol. I sleep well, don’t do drugs, and try to work out 2-3 times a week. My physical shape isn’t perfect, but it’s not terrible either. I also follow a KETO diet on and off, switching between keto and carbs every few weeks. 
P.S. I don't wear glasses and I have no problems with my eyes and I can see very well.

*Looking for Advice*

I’m desperate for answers because my life isn’t the same anymore. I can’t drive, struggle with public transport, and can’t even enjoy the things I used to love.

If anyone has experienced something similar or has any ideas about what this could be, I would truly appreciate your help.

Thank you ♡

So, I dated this guy I started talking to on Instagram earlier this year. He first saw me on Bumble, but by the time he checked out my IG profile, I had already deleted my Bumble account—I was just too exhausted from the dating app scene. He slid into my DMs, and we started chatting. He told me he was interested and attracted to me (probably based on my pictures). Since my friends had been bugging me to start dating this year, I decided to entertain the idea. We flirted a bit on IG, and after a week, he started asking me out for a coffee date.

I agreed, and we planned to meet that Saturday at a mall in the South—a location that was a fair middle ground for both of us. Everything was set. But then, on Thursday night, he called me and asked if we could move it to Sunday because he had a dental appointment on Saturday. (Red flag #1.) I wasn’t thrilled about the sudden change, so I declined, telling him I also had a dental appointment on Sunday. I said we could just meet some other time.

We eventually rescheduled, and I told him I was free on Saturday. Oddly, he still pushed for Sunday, which contradicted what he had said earlier about going out when I was available. (Red flag #2.) Still, I agreed. He asked if I’d be okay watching a horror movie—his favorite genre—and I said sure, I wasn’t picky. We settled on meeting at a mall near my place.

The Day of the Date

That morning, I woke up early to mentally prepare myself. Meeting a stranger wasn’t exactly my thing, but I was giving it a shot. Before leaving, he called to remind me about our date. We talked for a bit while I was getting ready. He got to the mall first and texted that he was already at the cinema. Since I lived just a few blocks away, I headed out and arrived in about six minutes. He only had to wait around ten minutes for me.

When we met, I told him to get tickets for the movie he wanted to watch. I didn’t look at him directly at first—he seemed shy and avoided eye contact. After buying the tickets, I asked what he wanted to do before the movie started and if he wanted to eat. We checked out a new food court before heading to the ramen places. I asked if he was okay with ramen or if he preferred rice, and he just said, “Whatever you want is fine.” (Not exactly decisive, but okay.) We ate, chatted a bit, and then went back to the cinema.

Inside, we were the first ones there. As we waited for the movie to start, I suddenly felt exhausted. I told him I might nap for a bit, and he said he’d wake me up when the movie started. But instead of sleeping, I started feeling…off. Both my ears began ringing, a headache hit me out of nowhere, and I felt nauseous. The movie was actually good, but I couldn’t focus because of how awful I felt.

After the movie, I asked what he wanted to do next. He seemed unsure, so I suggested getting coffee and led him to Starbucks. I paid for our drinks, and he insisted on buying pastries, so I let him. My headache worsened, but I powered through, trying to listen to him. He talked about his past failed dates. I asked why they didn’t work out, but honestly, I don’t even remember his answer—my head was pounding too much. I crossed my arms, trying to calm myself, but it only got worse.

Eventually, he asked if we could leave, and I immediately said yes. He rushed ahead, but I told him he could book a car at the nearby exit. He insisted on walking me out of the mall first. Before we parted ways, I shook his hand and stepped back, which seemed to catch him off guard. He looked surprised, and I quickly apologized.

When I got home, he texted me a simple “Thanks.” I replied the same.

Then today, I found out he restricted me on Instagram.

So, I blocked him. No sadness, no disappointment. Just relief. Honestly? I’m glad he made the first move.

He first saw me on Bumble, but by the time he checked out my IG profile, I had already deleted my Bumble account—I was just too exhausted from the dating app scene. He slid into my DMs, and we started chatting. He told me he was interested and attracted to me (probably based on my pictures). Since my friends had been bugging me to start dating this year, I decided to entertain the idea. We flirted a bit on IG, and after a week, he started asking me out for a coffee date.

I agreed, and we planned to meet that Saturday at a mall in the South—a location that was a fair middle ground for both of us. Everything was set. But then, on Thursday night, he called me and asked if we could move it to Sunday because he had a dental appointment on Saturday. (Red flag #1.) I wasn’t thrilled about the sudden change, so I declined, telling him I also had a dental appointment on Sunday. I said we could just meet some other time.

We eventually rescheduled, and I told him I was free on Saturday. Oddly, he still pushed for Sunday, which contradicted what he had said earlier about going out when I was available. (Red flag #2.) Still, I agreed. He asked if I’d be okay watching a horror movie—his favorite genre—and I said sure, I wasn’t picky. We settled on meeting at a mall near my place.

The Day of the Date

That morning, I woke up early to mentally prepare myself. Meeting a stranger wasn’t exactly my thing, but I was giving it a shot. Before leaving, he called to remind me about our date. We talked for a bit while I was getting ready. He got to the mall first and texted that he was already at the cinema. Since I lived just a few blocks away, I headed out and arrived in about six minutes. He only had to wait around ten minutes for me.

When we met, I told him to get tickets for the movie he wanted to watch. I didn’t look at him directly at first—he seemed shy and avoided eye contact. After buying the tickets, I asked what he wanted to do before the movie started and if he wanted to eat. We checked out a new food court before heading to the ramen places. I asked if he was okay with ramen or if he preferred rice, and he just said, “Whatever you want is fine.” (Not exactly decisive, but okay.) We ate, chatted a bit, and then went back to the cinema.

Inside, we were the first ones there. As we waited for the movie to start, I suddenly felt exhausted. I told him I might nap for a bit, and he said he’d wake me up when the movie started. But instead of sleeping, I started feeling…off. Both my ears began ringing, a headache hit me out of nowhere, and I felt nauseous. The movie was actually good, but I couldn’t focus because of how awful I felt.

After the movie, I asked what he wanted to do next. He seemed unsure, so I suggested getting coffee and led him to Starbucks. I paid for our drinks, and he insisted on buying pastries, so I let him. My headache worsened, but I powered through, trying to listen to him. He talked about his past failed dates. I asked why they didn’t work out, but honestly, I don’t even remember his answer—my head was pounding too much. I crossed my arms, trying to calm myself, but it only got worse.

Eventually, he asked if we could leave, and I immediately said yes. He rushed ahead, but I told him he could book a car at the nearby exit. He insisted on walking me out of the mall first. Before we parted ways, I shook his hand and stepped back, which seemed to catch him off guard. He looked surprised, and I quickly apologized.

When I got home, he texted me a simple “Thanks.” I replied the same.

Then today, I found out he restricted me on Instagram.

So, I blocked him. No sadness, no disappointment. Just relief. Honestly? I’m glad he made the first move.

I've probably been watching boatloads of instructional videos on barista stuff, more time than I even spend on uni, spent about as much on different coffee stuff as I'm probably going to get paid for my hours all this kinds of stuff and then I go into work and I feel like they are actively trying to make my time there miserable.

I have been on time if not early for every shift I've had so far but this morning I was 4 minutes late - because I was up all night doing uni work and looking at some shit about customer interaction techniques for front-facing business, my manager was already in and looking at me like I was already messing up said ""Get your shit together"" - my shit is so together, I've been trying to talk to her about how we handle rush hours and she doesn't want to hear about it, she'll do this thing where she'll ignore me while I'm talking to her or day I was speaking too fast for her to understand which is BS because I interact with customers just fine, and she'll also comment the same when I'm actually interacting with customers; repeating me (like mocking) and joking that customers must not have been able to understand me or saying like ""surprised he needs to breathe""

One time last week, one of the other baristas, Matt, rearranged the till area while I was on break - fully couldn't find anything - and he made a snarky comment about it when I asked why, ""should've been here"" and I told him I was on break and he said ""didn't know you took breaks"", which obviously I do because everyone does.

I heard Matt talking with another one of our coworkers(""Ava"")"" last week and she said to him i was ""a liability"". I pay attention, I've not messed anything up, been late once by 4 minutes after 14 shifts. Not to mention this constant weird tension where they're kind of icing me out, they all repeatedly call me the wrong name; ""Dewey"" instead of ""Drew"".

I can feel it in my fucking bones that they're trying to make me miserable, right now all I'm doing is staying positive, upbeat and polite but I'm not sure if that's what I'm meant to do, I don't want them pushing me into a corner so I end up looking bad but I can't afford to lose this job or let them make me lose this job if that's what they're doing.

I have a similar situation going on with my flatmates and I don't know if that's coloring my feelings here or not so I'm wondering if maybe I'm overreacting

How can I overcome the gut-wrenching pain and guilt?,"My girlfriend broke up with me for the second time and I am lost. I feel it's all my fault but I suspect some emotional abuse and manipulation. Please help me.  

Hello everyone,

I am writing this post because I feel completely lost. Sorry for the wall of text but I can’t stop overanalyzing what happened, and I desperately need an external perspective.

I was in a relationship with a woman who I believe was emotionally abusive, manipulative, and deeply unstable. But part of me still feels like I was the problem and I am guilty of losing her.

**Background on Her Life**

She grew up in an emotionally abusive household. Her mother was controlling, aggressive, and would scream and emotionally blackmail the family. Their parents divorced when she was little. Her father was passive and submissive, trying to keep the peace. Those dynamics still last to this day.

She both resents and seeks validation from her mother, constantly craving her approval despite recognizing the toxicity.
She told me she had never had a healthy relationship before. All of them ended in some disaster. Now, I think it's because of how she perceives love.

**How She Treated Me in the Relationship**

At the beginning, everything was perfect. She went fast, idolized me, called me the love of her life, and at the same time she kept me secret for the first 3 or 4 months - we were together 1 year more or less. She talked about marriage, kids and our future together almost immediately. But over time, things changed:
She expected me to conform to her ideal boyfriend model rather than valuing me for who I was.
She could not handle differences in opinions. If I disagreed, it was like I was attacking her.
She would lash out aggressively or in a manipulative manner when I set boundaries or expressed my needs.
She never apologized first, or I should say almost never. Whenever she hurt me, she would justify herself, rewrite history, or make it my fault.
When I made mistakes (and I did, because I’m not perfect), I would apologize and try to fix things, but it was never reciprocated.

I think she shows BPD traits. It's like she lives in an eternal present decided by her present feelings. She lacks my emotional permanence and she seems to see me as an angel or a devil. Finally, she discarded me after two times she went missing.

**The First Breakup**

We were in a semi long-distance relationship. I traveled to see her many times (5 hour train), and whenever she came to my city, it was never just to see me - she always had other priorities. I was unemployed and I had more time to visit her. Nonetheless, I felt the commitment wasn’t the same. 

One night I told her this and she lashed out telling me that I should get over this as she had anxiety when she comes to our city and she needs to make time for everyone and that I should not stress her on this. I offered her to stay at my place when she came if that was stressful for her. “I want to be comfortable not in 15 square meters”. I felt very hurt, my commitment was total. But she never came back just for me.

The next day, she ghosted me the entire day. I waited for a message, and when she didn’t text, I messaged her asking her to return a camera I had lent her. She later told me that this was proof that I only cared about getting my things back.

She disappeared for three days. I kept texting, trying to get her to talk, to explain what had happened, but she always blamed me in her messages. Finally, I sent her a long message explaining my pain and confusion.

I see her in a park the next day and we argue and she fuckin applaude to me when I tell her what I did for her and what I do to build a future for me and then for us. 

We broke up. No contact for one week, then I called her. Then we got back together. But something started to seem off, as my trust was damaged.

**The Second Breakup**

One time, she came to my city, and we had planned to go for a walk together. That morning, her friend invited her for coffee with her mother, and she said yes without even asking me. 

When I pointed it out, she exploded:
She screamed at me, saying I was antisocial.
She compared me to her exes, claiming they were more involved in her social circle.
She said in a relationship, “we decide things for both of us,” implying that she had the right to decide what I should do without consulting me.
She left the house saying she didn’t want to see my face.

In the evening we had a party planned where she kissed me on the lips like nothing happened. I started noticing how unstable she was: she wanted me to call her ""love"" again almost immediately, even though I was still hurt. 

She came to my place to sleep and I tried to talk about the episode. She didn’t want to and shutted of. I tried 2 more times, I never could express my pain as it was my fault for bringing it up at the wrong times. I felt hurt but we kept in touch and I went to visit her in her city. 

Everything was strange because we kept in touch in a cold way, because she stopped called me love (even if she tried to “push” me with her behaviour). I went to her city also to fix things up: I expected her to recognize my pain and to…apologize. It was really that simple but she couldn’t. 

One day in her city she told me to start anew and I…asked her to apologize for that thing and she did with some… effort. From there I started to use more pet names but still not “love”: I told her “ I love you” in english and not in our native language and she felt offended. She stopped calling me love altogether while I tried to call her softer pet names. I come back to my city and we told each other how exciting it will be when she will come back in our city and we will do everything together: she was happy and even bought tickets for a show in our city. 

Then, we broke up the second time while video calling two days later, because I called her a soft pet name and not love, after we spent a weekend at her city where we argued three times for stupid things she brought up. It’s almost she started to see me as an enemy who wanted to punish her. I lost my temper and I didn’t want to talk to her. I didn’t insult her or anything, I was just…so done. I told her I didn’t want to talk to her and she went:”We need time from each other” and “Don’t be so fast to hang up as you will not see me for a long time” with a smirk on her face.

And, in fact, she went missing 14 days. I, of course, broke down and texted her to see each other to talk about it as two adults. She agrees and we go for a coffee.

When we start to talk about the breakup she started blaming me for everything: not having a solid future plan, not making enough sacrifices, not calling her the way she wanted. I confess that I feel guilty that if I called her love instead of listening to my scarred heart then she wouldn’t have left, but it seems off. I was very hurt and I tried to slowly feel trust for her and her love, and so I called other “softer” pet names. She wasn’t satisfied. And, of course, “I would have texted you if you did not, but you went first”.
She repeatedly criticized my family, calling them “inhospitable.” She knew how much that hurt me and she never apologized.
She expected me to always prioritize her, but if I asked for something in return, like validating my pain and my emotions, I was being selfish and “too sensitive” and “always anxious”.
Anyway, she broke up with me.

I desperately called her back and I tried to have a serious conversation about our relationship. 

I told her:

-We both grew up in toxic emotional environments and learned a distorted idea of love.
-In healthy love, we accept each other’s differences instead of trying to “win” over the other person.
-She had a pattern of destroying the relationship the moment she feared I would leave.
-She saw love as a power dynamic rather than mutual care where if one feels impeding abandonment then he/she should breakup first to avoid being abandoned.

Her reaction? 

She said I was the one afraid of abandonment.
She said I was the one trying to manipulate her and I was the one who saw her as an angel who had to save me.
She even denied yelling at me about the coffee, and then, when I pressed her, she said she was right to yell at me for what I told her that day (like involve me when deciding for things that alter the plans we made? As a couple?)
She said she couldn’t love someone who wasn’t “one” with her in every decision.
The final moment came when we saw each other at a bar and she told me she didn’t feel happy anymore and wanted to end the relationship for the good of us both. 

The causes?

- I didn’t call her love for 10 days and she wasn’t feeling loved. I, the hurt one, swallowed my pride and still did everything for her. But to call her love when she stomped me and never took accountability was too much, I needed time. She never cared to help me regain that trust with the communication. 

- I didn’t plan a future with her, not following her schizoid decisions: I wanted a plan that was solid, not a fantasy one. I needed time to know her better and to build a solid relationship. She didn’t have time (also the biological clock at 33 played a big role. I understand it and I wanted to be there for her to build a future but I started to feel neglected) and wanted me to follow her strange plans where she goes to a city for work, then 9 months later she leaves for another city. 

Anyway, I told her I didn’t want to be part of the decision - she was the one leaving.

Sometimes it felt like she discarded me for some fears embedded deeply in her, like some sort of BPD mechanics.

**Why I Feel Guilty Now**

I feel like I should have just called her ""love"" and suppressed my pain.
I feel like I should have adapted to her vision of a relationship.
I feel like maybe I should have compromised on our future plans to keep her.
I feel like I abandoned the ""hurt little girl"" inside her that I tried so hard to protect.
I gave everything, but she still left - twice.

Now, I can't stop feeling like it was my fault. That I could have saved this.

But what hurts the most is thinking she will move on easily, meet someone new, and be happy. That all my love, all my effort, was just a passing phase for her.

**TL;DR**

My ex had a history of emotional abuse from her mother and carried toxic relationship patterns into our relationship.
She never took responsibility for her actions, always flipped the blame on me, and used DARVO techniques.
She left me twice, and I was always the one trying to fix things.
Now, she’s gone, but I feel guilty as if I was the problem.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this. I really need some perspective.

To truly understand your eating habits, you’ll need to track every meal, snack, and sneaky midnight fridge raid. Welcome to your food diary, where judgment is optional, but enlightenment is guaranteed.

Start by listing everything you eat and drink—yes, even that handful of chips you stole from a co-worker. Jot down meal times, portion sizes, and every condiment (looking at you, ranch dressing). You’ll notice patterns, like skipping breakfast or inhaling cookies at 3 p.m. like it’s a competitive sport.

Tracking your meals is like uncovering a food-based whodunit. The culprit behind those extra pounds? Hidden calories. That “healthy” smoothie? Basically a milkshake in a yoga outfit. And don’t even get me started on coffee creamers; they’re sugar bombs masquerading as harmless additions.

Go old-school with a notebook, or embrace the tech gods with apps that scan barcodes and calculate macros. Some apps even cheer you on for eating a carrot—because, hey, validation is everything. But remember, this isn’t about calorie obsession. It’s about catching the culprits behind your snack drawer’s depletion.

Stick with this for a month, and you’ll see patterns emerge. Maybe you’re a serial breakfast skipper or an overzealous condiment enthusiast. Whatever the case, this diary will reveal the truth. Use this knowledge to adjust your habits, like eating a balanced breakfast or realizing that mayo doesn’t belong on everything. 

A food diary isn’t about shame; it’s about power. Knowing what you consume empowers you to make mindful choices. It’s like therapy for your diet—with fewer tears and more fibre. So, embrace your food diary. It’s your ticket to better health, fewer regrets, and maybe even discovering you don’t actually hate kale.

Start your food diary as soon as you start hating your love handles. Who knows? It might just turn you into the mindful eater you always pretended to be

I've probably been watching boatloads of instructional videos on barista stuff, more time than I even spend on uni, spent about as much on different coffee stuff as I'm probably going to get paid for my hours all this kinds of stuff and then I go into work and I feel like they are actively trying to make my time there miserable.

I have been on time if not early for every shift I've had so far but this morning I was 4 minutes late - because I was up all night doing uni work and looking at some shit about customer interaction techniques for front-facing business, my manager was already in and looking at me like I was already messing up said ""Get your shit together"" - my shit is so together, I've been trying to talk to her about how we handle rush hours and she doesn't want to hear about it, she'll do this thing where she'll ignore me while I'm talking to her or day I was speaking too fast for her to understand which is BS because I interact with customers just fine, and she'll also comment the same when I'm actually interacting with customers; repeating me (like mocking) and joking that customers must not have been able to understand me or saying like ""surprised he needs to breathe"" 

One time last week, one of the other baristas, Matt, rearranged the till area while I was on break - fully couldn't find anything - and he made a snarky comment about it when I asked why, ""should've been here"" and I told him I was on break and he said ""didn't know you took breaks"", which obviously I do because everyone does.

I heard Matt talking with another one of our coworkers(""Ava"")"" last week and she said to him i was ""a liability"". I pay attention, I've not messed anything up, been late once by 4 minutes after 14 shifts. Not to mention this constant weird tension where they're kind of icing me out, they all repeatedly call me the wrong name; ""Dewey"" instead of ""Drew"".

I can feel it in my fucking bones that they're trying to make me miserable, right now all I'm doing is staying positive, upbeat and polite but I'm not sure if that's what I'm meant to do, I don't want them pushing me into a corner so I end up looking bad but I can't afford to lose this job or let them make me lose this job if that's what they're doing.

I have a similar situation going on with my flatmates and I don't know if that's coloring my feelings here or not so I'm wondering if maybe I'm overreacting 

TL:DR; my coworkers and managers are making little comments and stuff like that, which I feel is to make me want to quit or is this just normal workplace stuff and I'm overreacting?

I'm feeling a little deflated and unsure the meds are really doing much for me. 

I started at 30mg in early December just gone, and I felt a good sense of well being (having suffered with unexplainable low mood most of my adult life). 

I went up to 50 after a week. On the first day I felt an impending sense of doom - and the feeling of having had 17 cups of coffee, which passed quickly. I also couldn't stop biting the skin on the inside o fmy mouth. Unfortunately this symptom has stuck.

I still feel quite wired most days. I'm up late and struggle with decision paralysis. 

I had an exceptionally stressful January, where I had to move house pretty much alone, go on a work trip abroad, deal with some health issues, and partake in family wedding one week after the other. And I know this could be influencing my feelings. 

I was able to get things done and to a high standard during the move, without too many emotional meltdowns- but I find this limited to more physical tasks, like packing, shopping, cutting up boxes etc. But I feel almost no motivation to do my desk job.

I'm also a bit more grumpy and irritable than I think is my norm. 

In terms of decision paralysis, I'm going round and round googling with small things. I probably spent more than 30 hours looking at beds - ending up just getting one from IKEA. And I've done similar with other household items and a dress for the wedding. 

I'm getting nothing done at work, though I have PLENTY to do. 

The endless googling has always been an issue, but the meds seem to be exasperating it and my procrastination is out of control. 

I've never experienced the life changing high that people on the forum have mentioned. And I don't know if I'm on a dose too high, too low, or whether I shouldn't be medicating at all. 

Can anyone related to my current experience?

Good answer from it? If you wanna add more I would love to read it.

-------

It’s great that you want to give Twin Peaks another shot! The show can feel strange at first, especially if you expect a typical crime drama. Here are some tips to help you enjoy it more:

1. Change Your Approach: Embrace the Weirdness

Don’t look for a straightforward detective story. Twin Peaks blends mystery, drama, absurd humor, and horror. What seems ""weird"" is intentional and part of its charm.

2. Immerse Yourself in the Unique Atmosphere

The haunting music by Angelo Badalamenti, the dreamlike cinematography, and the slightly offbeat dialogue—all of it creates an unforgettable vibe. Let yourself sink into it without worrying about understanding everything right away.

3. Dale Cooper Is the Key

If there's one character to focus on, it’s Special Agent Dale Cooper. His optimism, love for coffee and cherry pie, and fascination with unconventional methods make him a joy to watch. If you connect with him, the rest of the show will be much easier to enjoy.

4. Appreciate the Side Characters

Every resident of Twin Peaks has something odd or intriguing about them. Whether it’s Audrey Horne’s mysterious charm, Sheriff Truman’s quiet strength, or Dr. Jacoby’s eccentric glasses, there’s always a quirky detail to latch onto.

5. Accept That Not Everything Will Be Explained

David Lynch loves to play with expectations. Some things may seem absurd, but they follow an emotional rather than logical pattern. Don’t overanalyze—just experience it.

Maybe try rewatching the first two episodes with these ideas in mind. But if it still doesn’t click, that’s okay! Twin Peaks isn’t for everyone, but if it grabs you, it can be an unforgettable experience.

For those that have never come across a #TradeUpChallenge, here is what it's all about. A Trade-Up Challenge is a process where someone starts with a small, low-value item (like a paperclip or $1) and continuously trades it for something of greater value, eventually working up to a high-value item like a car or house.

Each trade is strategic, leveraging desirability, demand, and negotiation to maximize value. The challenge often gains momentum through social media or online communities, where people follow the journey and sometimes offer better trades to be part of the story. The ultimate goal is to see how far one can go through smart trades alone.

**Success Stories**

* Kyle MacDonald traded a red paperclip for a house in one year through 14 trades.

* Demi Skipper started with a bobby pin and traded up to a house in 18 months.

* Corbin White began with nothing and flipped items until he got a Tesla Model 3.

* Ryan Trahan started with a penny and made thousands of dollars in 30 days.

* Gary Vaynerchuk turned $20 from garage sale finds into over $10,000 by flipping.

**Why $100,000?**

I have chosen this amount because it is both challenging and also a substantial amount of money. I'm about to set off on a 6-9 month travel adventure with my wife. When we return, we plan to buy and renovate a house. $100,000 would mean we can create a much better place to call home.

Setting a challenging target will also force me to become more creative. That is always a good thing.

**The Rules**

These are my rules. If you'd like to join the challenge, you can set your own target and rules. Most of these challenges follow similar rules though.

* I am starting from zero. I cannot borrow money to start and cannot use any money I already have.

* I can use any resources I currently own, except money.

* I am allowed to earn by trading items I own and also by selling items. For example, I can buy an item for $5, sell it for $10, and then buy an item for $10 to sell for $20.

* I am allowed to do small jobs to raise cash, but am not allowed to work a regular job.

* I am allowed to accept donations.

* I am allowed to invest the money I make. For example, if I've reached $10,000 and am traveling in a place with limited opportunities, I am allowed to invest into stocks or crypto.

* I will document each step so that you can clearly see how I made money along the way. Be sure to follow me.

Clearly, it will be easier getting from $0 to $1 than it will be getting from $90,000 to $100,000. That means that each stage will require a different strategy. This is how I see each stage at the moment, although this could change depending on what I learn along the way. I don't expect it to be as easy as it looks on paper.

**Phase 1 ($0 to $100)**

What I will do at the start is sell some items I already own, which isn't much. As I mentioned above, my wife and I will start traveling next week. All my possessions will fit in one suitcase and one backpack. Anything we have left over in our condo will be given away, not sold. These are things like cooking items, ironing board and iron, etc.

The only item I can sell is my laptop. It's in great condition but not worth much. I estimate I can get $100-200 for it. I will sell that to get started.

I also have 3 ebooks that I will sell for donations.

Other than that, I hope to get a few donations along the way. Every little helps.

**Phase 2 ($100 to $1,000)**

Once I have $100, I plan to buy undervalued items and try to sell for higher amounts. This will be more difficult for me because we'll be traveling. I won't be able to buy any big items unless I can sell them right away. I'll cross this bridge when I get to it though.

**Phase 3 ($1,000 to $10,000)**

This phase will involve flipping more expensive items, so maybe laptops, cameras, etc. Those will be easy to carry if I can't sell right away. If I find any really good bargains, I may ship them home and sell at the end of the year. I'll need to decide this at the time.

**Phase 4 ($10,000 to $100,000)**

This phase will be the hardest. I am thinking of flipping cars and property. This is too far off to think about too much right now though.

If you have any tips, please let me know. The more help I can get, the more chance I have of succeeding. And I want to bring others along with me. Imagine if we all shared our strategies and succeeded with this challenge. What an awesome year it be.

Let me know if you plan to also do this. If you do, don't forget to share your successes and failures. I'm sure I'll have a few failures along the way.

If you plan to try this, you can start and finish the challenge on any dates you choose. You don't have to follow my dates or rules.

Today is 10 February 2025. Let the challenge begin.

Current amount: $0

Target amount: $100,000

But I had to paint the new office. I found that strange, but I went to a paint store and got what I needed. The new boss in my dream reminded me of a boss I used to have at a different company about 10 years ago.

I had a little trouble at the paint store because it had a strange escalator that I had to go up and down with some heavy buckets of paint and that was not easy. And then the line was configured in a way that I think I lost my place in line before I woke up. 

Driving to the paint store was also strange because I couldn’t figure out the road layout either. That was a bewildering part of the dream. 

They only paid me $125 for the painting of the room as well, which I felt was not enough. I remember thinking to myself during the dream that I should’ve said no to painting that and made them use a painting contractor. I also felt weird about doing that work for them when the job offer wasn’t feeling like a sure thing.

The job was located in a courthouse building in the town where I was born. That particular building has been demolished now, but in my dream, it was still there. 

There was another part of the dream that seemed unrelated to the job narrative. In that part of the dream, I was driving and thinking about stopping for coffee at Starbucks. I don’t drink coffee in real life. 

On Saturday night, I also dreamed that I had a different job. But it was not a pleasant dream, and my dad was the boss in my dream.

For some reason, when getting into the hobby of target shooting it didn't occur to me that my terrible eyesight might affect the ability to consistently aim with accuracy.

I first tried to force acclimation to my 9mm's (SAR-9 Gen2) iron sights, but after 500 rounds I still couldn't focus quickly and clearly with both eyes open, so I put it on hold until I can get an optic-ready slide or mounting plate for a red dot.

I then moved to the AR. I tried an LPVO but it didn't work for me, so I got rid of it and picked up a  red/green dot reflex sight which, so far, seems one of the better options, due presumably to a wide FoV and the infinite eye relief of reflex sights.

We met when we were 21, married at 24, currently both 27. He was always there, I remember when I'd pause my studying (both were in law school) and I'd go to the small pizzeria he worked at just to chill with him and steal a couple of his cigarettes. He was always nice, very beautiful, tall and muscular. Every time he saw me at work, he'd always make me coffee, sit with me, offer to make me a pizza, and was always such a nice gentlemen, who spoke with such a nice and calm tone. My friends were convinced he liked me, and I literally thought he was gay, because why did he never ask me out, ask me for my number or socials.

One of those days, I got the courage and asked him out, he flustered as he just repeatedly nodded, with his beautiful blue eyes almost bulging out of his eyes. He asked for my phone number and two days later he was in front of my house to pick me up, and y'all, this motherfucker was driving a Jeep Wrangler, two years older than him. 

We went on a walk, and then to a bar where he proceeded to drink a crazy ton of vodka without any consequence. I was in shock, I would've been in the hospital if I drank as much, I was on my second drink, he was ordering his fifth. Then he took me home, and if I didn't kiss him, he would've never done the first move.

Two days later, we are at mine, I made us nice dinner, and he brought a very expensive wine bottle, and promised to let me enjoy it it him, without him drinking the whole bottle. We talked about law school, and how draining is for him to only be able to study a day before the exams (yes, he'd read the whole book day before the exam and pass with a B, and I'd spend months studying to get a B. Once we even took the oral finals together, the professor asked him if he wanted one more question for an A, and he said ""B will do, I'm late for work). We drank that night and I asked him if he wanted to sleep with me, because I sure did. But he said that he didn't come over to my place just to sleep with me, because that would (to him) would mean our whole date was pointless if he just came to fuck. But at least he got more comfortable, each time he picked me up, or I went to his work, he kissed me so deeply.

We started dating, and at first, I thought of him as this very indecisive person who never made decisions and always let me do them. But I quickly learned of his ex whom before him was in a relationship where her boyfriend did every decision for her, and when she and my husband dated, she'd literally do anything for him if he gave her an order, and he hated that. He said he loved how I can tell him when he's being an idiot, and not to do a certain thing.

Three semesters left of law school, he told me and his family over dinner that he's not coming back to school for the next semester, and the other two, and he's joining the army. His family flipped out, and he explained his reasons very well, we need to graduate, and then if we wanted to be a lawyer (which he, and his folks did) we needed to go and do masters, then two years of practice to even be eligible to apply for the bar. And he said if he graduated, he's not doing masters, he will apply for the Intelligence agency and be a spy (and how sick of becoming a lawyer he was, I had no doubt that he would).

He passed all the exams and joined the army, three months he was on a military base in another city, and we barely talked. The day of the ceremony was the first time I saw him cry when he saw me. That night we made love, it wasn't our first time, but goddamn did it feel like one of the best times ever. He is very very good in bed, always makes me wonder what kinda stuff he's gotten himself into while in High school and uni. But I'd never complain to his good dick game.

He became a soldier, and with very little overtime and some work on weekend (usually he doesn't work weekends) he makes low six figures, which is 4.5 times more than the minimum wage in our country. He afforded his own apartment in the building he always wanted to live in, and then we had an amazing wedding, and even more amazing honeymoon in southern France.

I do now work as a lawyer, I had just begun working for this very nice older lady who has her own firm, in witch me and him used to go for practices over the summers, and we live in the apartment he always wanted to. Live cannot be more dreamy for me. Like, I feel like a high school girl whenever I see him walk into our room and start taking his clothes off to get in bed. The way he fucks is just... outta this world, he knows where and when to touch me, and it makes it all so much more perfect (although I think our neighbors hate us for it, especially after we both come home from night outs.) There's a very nice song in our region here called 'I'll birth you four sons' and I think about that song every time I look at this mans eyes.

We play videogames together all the time, our current obsession is Madden 23, and on day off all we do is play Madden, last night we watched the Super Bowl together, and he kept joking how Taylor Swift will break up with Travis for how badly the Chief lost. Sometimes he just talks stuff and I have no idea what he's saying, partially because 1. He talks too fast 2. I just stare at his beautiful face 3. His brain is filled with too many fun facts, I don't think is humanly possible to know.

Jackie - strawberry, especially the kind with actual strawberry in it.

Shauna - vanilla and she'd have this whole spiel about how vanilla is unfairly maligned as boring when it's actually super subtle and complex (It's her. She's vanilla).

Nat - any citrus gelato. If it has to be dairy she'll take vanilla. She has no spiel.

Lottie - cherry. It's very nostalgic for her.

Tai - coffee. Van gives her endless shit about it.

Van - i wanna say like boysenberry idk why 

Misty - triple fudge, bare minimum

Travis - chocolate, he acts all tough but he's basic

Javi - neapolitan but he never eats the vanilla

Ben - i think my man straight up doesn't eat ice cream

Laura Lee - mint

Callie - probably a really weird gourmet one that shouldn't exist

Jeff - cookies and cream, and you know our boy is a comfort eater

Akilah - honeycomb

Mari - specialty blood orange ice cream from a mexican grocery nobody knows about

Adam Martin - seems like a tangy and rich swirl kinda guy, maybe mango and butterscotch

Crystal/Krystal - choc chip

Kevyn Tan - bubblegum

Melissa - ice cream cake. No she will not elaborate.

Gen/Jen - vanilla caramel

Walter - something with rock pops in it

Pit Girl - peach",3,1739191724.0,Yellowjackets,3,0.8,False

We got along well. So one day I saw that he got promoted, which is a big deal. Two months earlier we had met for coffee, so wer still on a friendly basis even though we don’t work together anymore. For his promotion I quickly congratulated via WhatsApp-Message because I still have his number.  And in the same month he congratulated me for my birthday also over WA. 
He didn’t answer, no „thank you“ or anything. For almost three months I thought that he must be ignoring me for whatever reason. I deleted his number after that, I thought it was so rude. 
Now, a few days ago, he messaged me „ohh man. I just saw your message. Thanks a lot“ (and a lot of emojis. And then sent another message asking about the job.
I personally think he just looked up my name in his contacts, because he wanted to ask me something and then saw that he didn’t reply. 

Because, seriously, how can you overlook a message for three months? 

Even if he did, he seems to not care about me at all!

**Loggos: A Picture-Perfect Harbor Village**

Loggos, the smallest village on Paxos, is like something straight out of a postcard. Located along the island’s serene east coast, this quiet gem was originally founded in the 19th century to house workers building nearby olive presses. Today, it’s a tranquil retreat where time seems to slow down.

The heart of Loggos is its quaint harbor, where colorful fishing boats gently rock alongside luxurious yachts. Take a leisurely stroll along the cobbled streets, and you’ll find charming tavernas offering the freshest seafood, perfect for a leisurely lunch with a view. For a little adventure, hike up the hill for a breathtaking panoramic view of the Ionian Sea. And don’t miss Marmari Beach—this pebble beach is an ideal spot to unwind and soak up the peace that defines this village.

**Lakka: The Tranquil Seaside Escape**

If you’re after a serene getaway, Lakka at the northern tip of Paxos should be at the top of your list. Surrounded by lush olive tree-covered hills, this village is a picture of calm. The bay here is one of the most peaceful spots on the island, making it a favorite for those who love natural beauty.

A visit to Lakka wouldn’t be complete without exploring the 16th-century Venetian castle, perched above the village. From here, you’ll enjoy sweeping views of the bay and beyond. Afterward, head to Harami Beach—arguably the most stunning on the island, with waters so clear you can see straight through to the sandy bottom. It’s the perfect place to swim, sunbathe, or just lose yourself in the tranquility of Paxos.

**Gaios: The Vibrant Heart of Paxos**

As the capital and main port of Paxos, Gaios blends history with modern life in the most charming way. The Venetian fortress, sitting on a tiny islet just off the coast, adds an air of mystery and intrigue to this lively town. Hop on a boat to explore the fortress or take a stroll through the Paxos Museum to learn more about the island’s fascinating past.

Gaios is also the perfect place to experience local life. The town’s streets are lined with small shops and cozy cafes where you can grab a coffee or a bite while watching the world go by. It’s the beating heart of the island, where history, culture, and contemporary living come together effortlessly.

* **Fontana**: Nestled in the hills, Fontana is surrounded by olive groves and vineyards, making it an idyllic spot for those seeking a peaceful retreat. A perfect place for a relaxing afternoon walk or a quiet escape into nature.
* **Magazia**: For history lovers, Magazia is a must-visit. With its beautiful churches and sweeping views of the island, it invites you to slow down and soak in its cultural charm.
* **Ozias**: Located on the west coast, Ozias offers some of the most breathtaking sunsets you’ll ever see. Head there in the evening for a peaceful end to your day, watching the sun dip below the horizon.

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. RageMode  - Ashes (I Fall) [MODUS]**  
*Recommended if you like: Camo & Krooked, Lukher, Mefjus*  

Thanks to our genre going through what you might call a bit of a renaissance, electronic artists jumping on the DnB train is not something _too_ out of the ordinary lately. Some are fun experiments, some really seem to be just milking the genre for the hype, but some _do_ pull it off. A fine example of someone who didn't just pull it off, but actually managed to quickly establish himself as one of the best new names around, with a quality so high it's downright ridiculous, is Christoph Wall, better known as **RageMode**. 

**1.1. Making names for himself (2013 - 2016)**  

Of course, this level of excellence did not come overnight, this latest in the series of Austrian DnB talents has a far-reaching history that brought him to where he is today. From 2013 on, first as **RAGE MODE**, then as **Rage|Mode** and eventually as just **RageMode**, he started trying to get one of his names out by competing in mix competitions to play at festivals like _Electric Love_ and _River Sense_, the latter of which he actually landed a third place win in, resulting in one of his very first festival gigs - the first of many, really. At the same time, he started putting his very first, very own productions out into the digital world, from the sadly lost debut _Drop & Bass_ to other singles like _Thermo_, the Big Room House banger _Drop It_ and his Hardstyle rework of _Headhunterz_' _Live Your Life_. This genre diversity would keep on growing and growing, with his competition-smashing Trap remixes for _Rene Rodrigezz_ and _SKMC & Sean Curtis_, Electro House chune _Sweet Spot_, Future Bounce bop _Sumo_ and his Progressive House journey _Electric Innocence_ - plus a ton of bootlegs all across the spectrum! 

**1.2. ¡Vamos a la Genres! (2017 - 2018)**  

Said talent for reworking tunes actually lead to him participating in, and, in part thanks to his devoted _#RageArmy_, being crowned one of the winners of, _Electric Love_'s remix competition, finally bringing Christoph onto the Austrian festival's stage in 2017! He could feel the wild genre experimentation confusing his fans a little though, so in that same year, he declared RageMode would be his main alias for all things Bass House, while his Trap/Future Bass/Progressive House/anything else output would have a new home: **ItsVam**. Across various bootlegs for _David Guetta_, _The Chainsmokers_, _Ed Sheeran_, _Bruno Mars_ and a whole bunch more, Christoph would live out this diverse vamalgation of genres especially from 2017 to 2019, but still occasionally reemerging for another one-off. Interestingly enough, his remix for the smoke addict's _Somebody_ is actually DnB - one of the first examples of him exploring the genre I could find! Funnily enough, this strict division of sound was immediately violated, when Christoph and _Killin' Void_ put out their Dubstep bootleg of _Kayzo_'s _Holy_, but then again, we wouldn't be here if he had stuck to just one genre all this time! 

Sure, there were the occasional detours across other sounds, like his semi-serious _RageCore_ alias for (happy) hardcore and hardstyle, but otherwise he really did hone in on the House sound, with his and equally camel-cased _JustLuke_'s demo _Heartbeat_ even managing to get featured as Demo Of The Week on (nowadays also DnB exploring) _Don Diablo_'s Hexagon Radio! Gigs around the country, more bookings at Electric Love and his first time playing at Cologne's infamous Bootshaus, collabs with _Subshock & Evangelos_ and _MIDNIGHT CVLT_, both of which ended up pursuing DnB as well by the way, and a bunch of singles on _Bass House music_ - things were going really well during the late 2010s!

**1.3. Trading House for Drums (2018 - 2025)**   

Underneath it all, however, a storm was a-brewing. During his university studies, he not only worked on the audio for fake virtual reality extinct species zoo experience ad spot _We Are Zoo_ to raise awareness of climate change consequences in 2018 and was responsible for the audio, sound design, and music composition of 2021's _A Duck's Journey_, a puzzle-solving game and surely accurate depiction of a mallard's daily life, he also became the trainee of Schnitzelpower man himself, _Mefjus_, not just learning a whole lot, but also igniting his passion for the D and the B into an unstoppable wildfire. 

Roughly two years, a whole of perfecting his craft in the shadows and apparently a bunch of ghost producing in the EDM scene later, RageMode de'n'buted with his stunning remix of the other two thirds of the MODUS schnitzel boy band's anthem _No Way Out_ in 2023, and _boy_ was it ever worth the wait. With his equally amazing follow-ups _Save Me_ and his contribution to the otherworldly Let It Roll opening show, _Resurrection_, he squashed any remaining doubts in two fell swoops, (Christoph) walltzing all over the competition and becoming a core member of the **MODUS** roster. Quality takes time though, which meant that the next entry into his DnBiscography, _Run_, had to wait until late last year - but at least we got the next one pretty soon after. Just last week, in fact! 

**1.4. Ashes (I Fall)**  

RageMode's vocals are always top notch, but this newest emotional journey of his, **Ashes (I Fall)**, takes the, sadly uncredited, cake. Fully focusing on the unnamed singer's deeply heart-wrenching lamentations about the lack of support in a moment of vulnerability, Christoph allows us to connect with the emotionality of it all, heightening the stakes to wonderfully high levels of drama as our protagonist stops waiting for outside help and instead decides to take the challenge head-on. Through the bombastic thicket of choirs, string sections, and brasses, the electronic madness emerges one by one, evolving with every _""Yeah I fall""_, until exploding into a constellation of large walls of synths, pulsating waves of pure energy and two swift, sharp stabs, contrasted with the sheer combinatorial beauty of the orchestral arrangements and the vocalist's performance. Calming down a bit, we are lead into a truly euphoric resolution, with even more powerfully philharmonic loveliness, more brass and rolling drums softening the blows. Forever changed by this experience, however, the second half shows us just how cold and hard the protagonist had become, with icy, spike-y stabs ending it all. 

**1.5. Conclusion**  

Seamlessly going from heart-breakingly soft-spoken to goosebump-inducing orchestral work to larger-than-life electronic madness infused with intense levels of emotionality - this one is special. Even for RageMode's high standards! 

Other dramatic and techy things from this week:

- Blacksite - Adrenaline  
- Monrroe - Imprisoned  
- Laetho - Apophis

####**2. Napes - Shooters Hill EP [1985 Music]**  
*Recommended if you like: Samurai Breaks, Nectax, Fixate*  

Now for something completely different. Let's talk about one of the many Jungle breakout stars of the last couple of years, **Napes**! 

**2.1. Inspirations**

Infused with a deep love for old 60's and 70's Soul pioneers like _Curtis Mayfield_ and the Jazz escapades of _Miles Davis_ and _Bill Evans_, and further molded by a mild obsession for Rinse FM's radio sets from the early 2000s, Englishman Max Napier had always sought out deeper, lesser-known streams of music. No surprise therefore, that, in the process of learning to, falling in love with, and earning himself high grades in playing the drums at 16, he also fell deep into the Jungle rabbit hole. During his Audio and Music Technology studies at the UWE in Bristol, drum lover Max got more and more into what he referred to as the ""ultimate genre"" _(it's just drums!)_, eventually even writing his dissertation on the history of jungle, until finally joining in on the fun himself in 2019, as **Napes**. 

**2.2. Napes**

Blending the wild drum programming of Jungle with the ruff- and tuffness of Grime and the clinically precise sound design of minimal drum and bass, and not even shying away from incorporating adjacent sounds like footwork, garage and 140 into it all, Max had such a massively unique cocktail of UK styles on his hand, that it was basically inevitable he would make a huge splash right from his first tune, and the release of his ""drill n bass"" type free download, _Skeng_, in 2019 proved just that. Continuing down this rather fruitful free download road with _Bun Dem_, _Red Spyda_ and his _Tropical_ bootleg wasn't the only thing 2020 would bring though, he would also deliver straight _heat_ on his very first EP on _Encrypted_, on _Deep In The Jungle_'s _Anthem_ compilation, and with his debut on award-winning imprint _Born On Road_, which earned him the number one spot on the Beatport charts, across all genres! 

Things would slow down a bit during the next year and a half or so, with 2021 only seeing a couple of remixes and his collab with _Bruj_ on _Nemesis_ hitting the digital shelves - a hiatus he quickly managed to justify with his _Chopper Gunner_ EP on Born On Road. From there on out, Max started smacking out bangers left right and centre, from his 140-to-DnB transitionary experiments on _OCC_, to an appearance on the Shellerz EP series, to a full collaborative EP with fellow drum lover _Samurai Breaks_ on _Shall Not Fade_, to remixes for _S.Murk_ and _Toby Ross_, to making a debutorial appearance on _Critical Music_'s _New Energy_ compilation album. 

**2.3. Shooters Hill EP**

Now, the now London-based madman even made his way to Alix Perez' legendary **1985 Music**, with the absolutely _wicked_ **Shooters Hill** four-tracker, (probably) named after the South East London district of the same name. Not only is the artwork an actual work of art _(seriously, this deserves to be hung in a museum)_, each of the pieces making up the audio contents of it all are also outright _absurd_. Opener and title track **Shooters Hill**, with Nottingham-based Greeze Grime MC **Snowy** on the fast-paced chopped-up bars, already oozes so much Grime flair, with its phonky melodies and murky basses, and throws around so many snares, think breaks, and sound effects that you barely have time to react to anything, and while **Deja Vu 93.2** might be comparatively tamer, its relentlessly looping triplet melodies and drumwork made up of all sorts of delayed, doubled, and morphed hits still manages to cause chaos in your mind, especially once that set of new drums hits. 

After proving that he could just as well pursue the deep and dark, rolling sound if he wanted on this second stop's second half, show stopper **North Road** shows us exactly why he usually stays in the more hectic sounds. Triplet patterns following the rhythm of the sample's _oi oi oi_'s, strongly interwoven with tight, wild, and skittery drumwork, evolving to include more and more downright claustrophobic bass movements were already plenty vibey, but once the _original bad boi sound_ vocal joins in, Max lets loose a _storm_ of snares and breaks, quickly turning up the grime-y naughtiness levels another twenty notches, with wompy basses taking over and even faster drums circling around until you pass out. To close it all off, we do a little bit of **Tokyo Drifting** with the absolute wonkiest, tokyo drift inspired sounds and, somehow, perhaps the wildest drumwork yet. Fast _and_ furious. 

**2.4. Conclusion**

With sounds as wicked, drum programming as wild and vibes as off-the-charts as this, even my breakbeat-weary heart has no choice but to skank along. Legit insane.

Setting and achieving goals is one of the most significant aspects of personal and professional growth. But what is the force behind this drive? Why do some people seem naturally motivated while others struggle to even start?

In this blog, we’ll explore the key factors that propel individuals toward success. By understanding these drivers, you can harness them to fuel your own aspirations.

1. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation
Motivation generally falls into two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic.

Intrinsic Motivation
This refers to doing something because it’s inherently satisfying or meaningful.

✅ Example: An artist paints because they love expressing their creativity—not because they’re being paid.

🔹 Why It Works: Passion and internal fulfillment create lasting commitment. Intrinsic motivation is a powerful driver because it aligns with personal values and interests.

💡 Example Goals: Writing a novel, learning a language, running a marathon.

Extrinsic Motivation
This type of motivation stems from external rewards, like money, fame, or recognition.

✅ Example: You might aim for a promotion because of the higher salary and prestige attached to it.

🔹 Why It Works: Clear, tangible rewards provide a measurable sense of achievement.

💡 Example Goals: Getting a raise, winning an award, buying your dream house.

📢 Fun Fact: Oscar Wilde once quipped, “The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.” For some, even criticism can be a powerful extrinsic motivator!

2. A Clear Sense of Purpose
A strong “why” acts as a compass, guiding people toward their goals. Without a clear purpose, even the best-laid plans can falter.

🔹 How to Find Your Purpose: Ask yourself:

What impact do I want to make?
How will achieving this goal improve my life or others’ lives?

📌 Pro Tip: Write down your purpose and revisit it whenever your motivation wavers.

3. A Growth Mindset
Psychologist Carol Dweck popularized the concept of a growth mindset—the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort and learning.

💡 Why It Matters: Viewing failure as an opportunity rather than a dead end fosters resilience.

✅ How to Cultivate It: Replace thoughts like “I can’t” with “I can learn how.”

4. Accountability and Support
Humans are social creatures, and accountability often makes the difference between intention and action.

Ways to Build Accountability:
✔️ Join a community with similar goals.
✔️ Partner with an accountability buddy.
✔️ Regularly update a mentor or coach.

📢 Fun Fact: Research shows that you’re 65% more likely to achieve a goal if you commit to someone else—and 95% more likely if you schedule check-ins!

5. Emotional Connection and Visualization
Connecting emotionally to the outcome of your goal can be incredibly powerful.

💭 Visualization Technique:

Imagine yourself crossing the finish line of a race.
Picture how you’ll feel when your book is published.

🔹 Why It Works: Emotional engagement makes goals feel real and attainable, keeping you energized throughout the journey.

6. The Power of Habits
Successful people understand that consistency beats motivation. By breaking your goal into smaller, manageable steps and building habits around them, you can make progress without overwhelming yourself.

💡 Example: Instead of aiming to write a 300-page novel immediately, start with writing 500 words a day.

📌 Why It Works: Once a habit is ingrained, it requires less mental effort to maintain.

7. Fear of Regret
For some, the fear of looking back with regret is an incredibly strong motivator.

✅ How to Leverage It: Ask yourself:
""How will I feel in five years if I don’t do this?""

🚀 Hint: This works well for procrastinators—sometimes, the fear of regret can be stronger than the pull of Netflix.

8. Celebrating Progress
Acknowledging milestones—no matter how small—keeps the momentum going.

🎉 Ways to Celebrate Progress:
✔️ Treat yourself to a coffee after completing a big task.
✔️ Share your success with friends or social media.

📌 Why It Works: Celebrations boost dopamine levels, reinforcing positive behavior and keeping you motivated.

Conclusion: Your Drive Is Unique
People are driven by a mix of intrinsic desires, extrinsic rewards, emotional connections, and sometimes just a healthy dose of FOMO.

✨ The key is to identify what motivates YOU and build systems to sustain it.

So, whether you’re fueled by passion, fear of regret, or the promise of a reward, your commitment to the process is what truly matters.

📢 Remember: “Rome wasn’t built in a day, but they were laying bricks every hour.” Keep laying those bricks, and you’ll achieve your goals.

Hello Empowish Warriors! 💪

Do you ever feel like you're standing on the edge of greatness, but something just holds you back? That little voice inside that questions whether you're ready, whether you're good enough. Sound familiar? Let’s dive into silencing that self-doubt and unleashing your true potential! 🚀

We all have dreams we're nurturing into reality. But self-doubt? It's the sneaky shadow that follows passion and ambition, whispering questions we're sometimes too tired to fend off. Here's the thing: conquering self-doubt isn’t about getting rid of it forever. Instead, it's about learning how to manage it, refocus your mind, and keep moving forward.

✨ So, grab 5 minutes of your day, every day, to invest in these simple, yet powerful practices:

1. **Affirmation Activation** 🗣️
   Start your day with affirmations that set the right tone for your mindset. Choose an empowering statement like “I am capable, I am worthy, and I am evolving.” Saying it while looking at yourself in the mirror creates a visceral connection. These positive assertions act like mental vitamins for your soul. Build new neural pathways that foster confidence, inch by inch.

2. **Visualize Victory** 🎯
   Close your eyes. Breathe deeply. Imagine yourself accomplishing your biggest goal. Do this vividly – your surroundings, how you feel, and what you’ve achieved. Visualization turns abstract goals into something concrete your mind can latch onto. It stirs motivation and sets your thought patterns to “yes, you can!”

3. **Tune into Gratitude** 🙏
   Write down three things you’re grateful for every day. They don’t have to be grand – maybe it’s the aroma of your morning coffee or a text from a friend. Gratitude shifts focus from what you lack to what you abundantly have. It’s a grounding force that amplifies positivity and reduces self-doubt by highlighting your wins, big and small.

4. **Power Pose Burst** 🚶‍♀️
   Boost your confidence with a power pose! For two minutes, stand strongly – feet apart, hands on hips, chest out. It might sound goofy, but it prompts physiological changes that encourage confidence and diminish stress hormones. Channel your inner superhero and transform how you view your day’s challenges.

5. **Spark Connection** 🔗
   Engage with your community here on Empowish. Share your wins, your lessons – both humbling and triumphant. Ask for advice or offer support. Connection to a community reaffirms you’re not alone in this journey. Engage with others’ journeys and watch your own self-belief grow stronger with each interaction.

Remember, overcoming self-doubt isn’t about not feeling it – it’s about not letting it control your actions. It's a journey – part of the beautiful path of self-improvement. ⛰️
