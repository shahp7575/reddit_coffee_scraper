1qlua8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qlua8t/about_to_lose_a_friend_because_of_her_poor_social/,About to lose a friend because of her poor social skills,"First time posting. Where to begin \*sigh\*...I suppose I am after a sanity check, if anything?

I and my friend B has known each other for a while, probably 10 years, we are both in our 30s. I dont live where she lives so we meet maybe once in two years but follow each other on social media fairly closely, i e. recently regurarly commenting and liking each others posts etc.

Anyway, in the past couple of years I noticed B starting to make public social media posts about how she loses friendships, how friends no longer reciprocate or make an effort in striking converstation, how nobody asks her anything about her or comments on her posts (she expressed the displeasure for likes only with no comments left on her posts) and other things...making it pretty clear that B would like a pro active friend, commenting on her posts, DMing her etc. So I really tried doing all that since I felt like I was one of those she was talking about. I am a very carefree person and most of the time just 'like' posts and stories instead of commenting. I think for me it is a mixture of not having anything meanigful to say, being busy, quietly enjoying just watching other people's stories and simply not thinking too deep about it. But B made me feel indirectly guilty with her posts so I made a special effort of commenting whenever I could and sending her DMs and doing other online activies once in a while with her.

For the past year or so it went really well. Then we made plans for me to come to her hometown on my way to my parents (I fly),  but when we met up it was pouring down with rain and I had a flight to catch that day too, so we walked a bit in the rain and then decided to go to a cafe for a drink and something sweet to eat. This was the first time I fully came to appreciate that B doesnt eat outside. I noticed in some of her past posts where she would express her gratitude towards people (from work) to including and inviting her to their events, as these events mostly centered around food (group lunch, BD dinner etc). She wouldnt eat with the group, but she would be there at the table with the group without food. B also joined me later on in the day as I and another friend had breakfast together since B said she will join later once we finished eating. But to get back to the cafe - we ordered and B took it to go. I sat down and had my drink and cake and she just sat there. Went home later that day and ate it at home. So I know for a fact that her reluctance to eat outside is not about the food. I am easy going enough i think and if she said to me at the very beginning to not plan our outings around food, I wouldnt. I can just grab and go. But I learned of this about her on the go that day and it felt weird. We could just sit and chat at a library or go browse shops. Plenty of options that dont involve food. I just find it weird that when people plan a hang out and agree on getting brunch or going to a coffee shop and then one of them is not eating. But maybe this is my problem and not B's?

After this meeting I flew back home and to my surprise received a message from B summarising our hang out with an attached feedback form. I believe I laughed at first, but then realised B was dead serious. Her form included questions of the like: 'what do you like about our friendship' 'what do you not like about it' 'if you could choose one area where to improve it what is it and why' 'how can i be a better friend to you' 'is there something specific you want to address/cover on next hang out' etc. I was going to ignore it at first but then I thought about it as being really important to her so I started to draft my answers. I made special effort to draft my reaponses the way she types herself so that she would know I take this seriously. Each question with a para long answer each day, mentioning I am taking my time and portion those questions so that I can responds fully and trutfully (that is B's style, very methodical). It was odd, but I did it to make her happy. I think she was pleased with it.

This year I mentioned I would be fying in soon again since I have some gifts to give her in person. It is her BD around that time. I booked my flights the other day, based on my parents availability and flight cost. The flight is in the evening so not very convenient for traveling to my parents after landing, it is better to stay the night and travel next day. I took this opportunity and messaged B about my plan and if I could come and stay at hers. I havent booked it at the time of messaging her yet, so when she came back giving me her availability I went ahead and booked it as she was available for that time. I got excited so I started messaging her with ideas of how we can have a late night chat at hers or watch a movie etc and then in the morning either go for a walk before her work (i would walk her there) or she can take a half day off if she wants to and we can hang out for longer and do activities too. At this point it was just brainstorming (or so I thought). She came back to me with very specific comments such as she doesnt think we will be watching anything since I go to bed early (this is true, however I wouldnt mention the tv if I just wanted to go to sleep. I can change my routine easy if im on holiday or there is a special occassion, also I was just throwing out ideas to make it clear that I am easy and down for anything). But maybe I should have been more specific? Then B says that once I go to bed she would go and sleep at a local B&B. This left me speechless. B put it down like a no big deal and done solution. B said she doesnt like other people sleeping in the same room as her. Ok, fair enough? All B had to do was to tell me she cant accommodate me. But maybe she was looking for a solution without rejecting me? I dont know. I was taken aback by this, of course, as i would never stay at hers knowing I drove her out to sleep elsewhere. So I immediately texted back to say no way, stay at your place and I will get a hotel. I asked her if she could confirm her reservation can be cancelled free of fees, because if it wasnt then I would take over her reservation instead of finding another hotel. In the meanwhile I started researching hotel at the aiport. Sadly the majority hotels were sold out, only a couple of rooms left. Naturally i panicked a bit and texted her again to please let me know. B hasnt responded til like 22 hours later. By then i booked the room as i realised it had a free cancellation so I could always cancel it if she came back to me saying her room has fees for canceling. I let her know that and then she finally responded saying she doesnt go online very often and basically needed to cool down first before responding to my messages (another shock to me, like cool down from what? This is where I need my sanity check because I absolutely do not see where she could get upset in this?) So my jaw dropped reading that, and I felt offended by her response. I felt my blood boiling, considering all the other recent incidents and now I felt like B had no right to be the upset one. Anyway, i responded apologizing. I dont need drama or arguments. I dont feel like meeting with her anymore at this point, but i know that she took the morning off already so if she is still happy to meet than I will too. Maybe I am seeing things that are not there, and when we meet it will be fine. I know I am an overthinker so I am asking for advice? Am I the problem? I admit I should have given specific times and meeting points and activies when I approached her as I think her point of saying to me that I am creating a mess everytime we plan something is probably true. I should ha e realised we have different approaches to this (i am am adhoc, lets see what happens activity wise person, whereas she is very organised and methodical). I wonder if two people like that can remain friends? Do we have a future, or am I going to constantly feel like I am doing something wrong? Do i need to work on something? I appreciate any advice.",2,1769278457.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1qlu2rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1qlu2rm/how_to_be_disgustingly_charismatic_the_psychology/,How to Be DISGUSTINGLY Charismatic: The Psychology That Actually Works,"honestly, i've spent way too much time studying this. like an embarrassing amount. i've read dozens of books on influence, watched endless hours of charisma breakdowns on youtube, listened to psychology podcasts while doing laundry. why? because i realized most guys (including past me) think charisma is some genetic lottery you either win or lose. turns out that's complete horseshit.

the real issue isn't that you're boring or awkward. it's that nobody taught us this stuff. schools don't have ""how to not be forgettable"" classes. your parents probably just said ""be yourself"" which is terrible advice if yourself is currently invisible in social situations. but here's what i discovered after diving deep into social psychology research and interviewing techniques used by FBI negotiators, talk show hosts, and yes, even studying why certain people just draw others in effortlessly.

 charisma is a learned skill, not a personality trait

biggest misconception: thinking you need to be loud, extroverted, or naturally funny. research from MIT's Human Dynamics Lab shows charisma actually breaks down into presence, warmth, and power. you can be quiet as hell and still magnetic.

the game changer for me was reading ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane. she's coached everyone from Fortune 500 execs to introverts who could barely make eye contact. her whole thesis (backed by neuroscience) is that charisma comes from specific behaviors you can practice. the book breaks down exactly how to project confidence even when you're anxious, how to make people feel like they're the only person in the room, and why your internal state matters more than your words. insanely practical. she includes actual exercises you can do anywhere. this book will make you question everything you think you know about social skills.

 master the art of listening (no really)

most people don't listen, they just wait for their turn to talk. charismatic people do the opposite. they ask better questions and actually give a shit about the answers.

chris voss talks about this in ""Never Split the Difference"". he's an ex FBI hostage negotiator who realized the same techniques that work in life or death situations work in everyday conversations. his concept of ""tactical empathy"" is brutal. basically, make people feel understood before you try to be understood. mirror their last few words as a question. use calibrated questions like ""what makes you say that?"" or ""how did that feel?"" instead of yes/no garbage. the book teaches you how to read people, build instant rapport, and become someone others actually want to talk to. genuinely one of the best communication books i've ever read.

 fix your nonverbal game immediately

mehrabian's research (yeah the 55% body language guy) gets misquoted constantly but here's what matters: your body language either amplifies or kills whatever comes out of your mouth.

simple fixes that make you look instantly more charismatic:

• maintain eye contact for 3-4 seconds before breaking. too little makes you seem shifty, too much gets creepy

• angle your body toward whoever's speaking. seems obvious but most people are physically checked out

• slow down your movements. rushed gestures scream anxiety

• take up space without being obnoxious. don't fold into yourself

• smile with your eyes not just your mouth. fake smiles don't engage the orbicularis oculi muscle and people can subconsciously tell

vanessa van edwards breaks this down perfectly in her youtube channel ""Science of People"". she analyzes everything from TED talks to first dates using actual research. her video on hand gestures alone changed how i present myself. she's got tons of free content on reading body language, vocal tone, and micro expressions.

 develop genuine curiosity about people

charismatic people make you feel interesting. they're not performing, they're genuinely curious. robert greene talks about this in ""The Laws of Human Nature"", this 500 page beast that's basically a psychology PhD in book form. greene studied historical figures, con artists, leaders, and synthesized what makes certain people unforgettable.

the section on empathy hit different. he argues most of us are trapped in our own perspective, and the moment you can genuinely see things from another person's viewpoint, you become magnetic. he teaches you how to read people's character, understand their motivations, and connect on a deeper level. warning: it's dense but absolutely worth the investment. best book on understanding human behavior period.

if you want a more structured way to internalize all this, there's an app called BeFreed that pulls from books like these, along with research papers and expert insights on social psychology and communication. it creates personalized audio learning plans based on your specific goals, like ""become more charismatic as an introvert"" or ""master small talk in professional settings.""

what's useful is you can customize the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. since most of us listen during commutes or at the gym, the voice options matter, you can pick anything from a calm, thoughtful tone to something more energetic. it connects the dots between different sources and builds an adaptive plan that evolves as you progress. makes the learning feel less scattered and more actionable.

 stop trying to impress people

counterintuitive but true. the more you try to prove you're smart/funny/successful, the more people pull away. charisma isn't about you, it's about how you make others feel.

practical shift: instead of thinking ""what can i say to sound interesting?"" think ""how can i make this person feel valued?"" compliment specifics not generalities. ""you seem really passionate about that"" hits harder than ""that's cool."" ask followup questions that show you were actually listening. celebrate other people's wins without making it about you.

 build your conversational toolkit

you need stories. not long rambling ones, but 2 minute anecdotes you can pull out that are actually engaging. charismatic people aren't naturally better storytellers, they just practice more.

matthew dicks wrote ""Storyworthy"" specifically about this. he's won moth storytelling competitions multiple times and teaches you how to find stories in everyday life and tell them in ways that land. his ""homework for life"" exercise is simple: every night, write down one moment from that day worth remembering. over time you build a mental library of stories and you start noticing story worthy moments as they happen. game changer for never running out of things to talk about.

 work on your energy management

charisma requires energy. if you're burnt out, anxious, or running on 4 hours of sleep, no technique will save you. this sounds basic but most people ignore it.

the app ""Finch"" has been lowkey helpful for building better daily habits around sleep, exercise, and stress management. it's a selfcare app that doesn't feel preachy. you take care of a little bird and it grows as you complete wellness goals. sounds dumb but it actually works for building consistency with things like meditation, getting outside, or just checking in with yourself emotionally.

 practice in low stakes situations

don't wait for important moments to develop charisma. practice with baristas, uber drivers, people in line. these interactions don't matter so there's zero pressure, but they're perfect for trying new techniques.

challenge yourself: next time you're getting coffee, ask the barista a genuine question about their day and actually listen to the answer. make eye contact with someone walking past and nod. start conversations in places you normally wouldn't. the more reps you get, the more natural it becomes.

 embrace strategic vulnerability

brené brown's research on vulnerability shows that people connect with authenticity, not perfection. sharing something real (not trauma dumping, just being honest) makes you more relatable and trustworthy.

admitting you don't know something, sharing a genuine struggle, or laughing at yourself when appropriate makes you human. charismatic people aren't afraid to be imperfect in front of others.

look, becoming charismatic isn't about faking a personality. it's about removing the barriers that stop people from seeing who you actually are, and developing skills that help others feel comfortable, valued, and engaged around you. it takes practice and you'll have awkward moments. but i've seen too many guys (including myself) go from forgettable to magnetic by just implementing this stuff consistently.

you're not broken, you just haven't learned the playbook yet.",1,1769277991.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False

1qlu1i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorkpa/comments/1qlu1i5/beware_gather_256/,Beware - Gather 256,"Went in for brunch with my mom and sister this morning. This was my first time here, and I was excited at the fact there were multiple vegan options. Good google reviews, so was not expecting the experience that we had. 

Immediately felt unwelcome upon entering. We were met with stares and silence. Almost as if they were bothered by us being there. 

We paid upfront for coffee and breakfast sandwiches. Drinks came out quick, but we waited over an hour for our food that was never made. We were completely ignored after we paid, never once again acknowledged. It was as if we no longer existed. We checked in once after about 50 minutes for our food, and were given no real explanation on the status. Multiple groups of customers came in, ordered and received their food within 15-20 minutes. The final time we checked on the order is when we were told it was never made. That was over an hour after we had paid. Again, no explanation was given. There were 3-4 workers standing at the counter talking nearly the entire time, and did not care at all that we were not helped. Not even given an apology. 

Us being a group of Latinas, it absolutely felt like we were outsiders and did not belong. Disgusting atmosphere and service. Please beware. 

Just sad all around. I would have loved to support a small business with vegan/vegetarian options, but this experience was very upsetting. 

Would welcome any suggestions on how else to make this known. ",7,1769277911.0,yorkpa,7,0.7,False

1qlu0ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienAbduction/comments/1qlu0ia/two_encounters_about_ten_years_aparttell_me_what/,Two “encounters” about ten years apart…tell me what you guys think. Thanks," Hello and thank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to read this. In order to tell each event thoroughly this post is going to be a bit lengthy… all of the details are true. Only the names of the people involved have been changed for their own privacy. I remember both occurrences like they happened literally yesterday. They have stuck with me, and only now am I sharing them. There’s always going to be haters but please don’t be cruel.

Rewind: The year is approximately 1996. I am 8 years old at this time. I wake up sometime during the night. Not sure what time it is. But it is still very dark outside, pitch black. No sign of the sun coming up anytime soon. I remember seeing something outside. I can’t tell you what I saw I don’t remember. I would guess maybe it was the light. But like I said I don’t actually recall. I remember being afraid. So I ran and hid underneath the camper trailer in the driveway. As I lay underneath the camper trying to be still and silent I can remember feeling drawn to something. I know there was a craft in front of me. In the middle of my driveway, just sitting there. The light were bright. I couldn’t make out what it looked like. Not because of the lights, it just seemed like something had made it into a blur while the rest of the scene was totally visible. I could see everything else just fine. But now I was no longer under the camper. I could see a group of beings. They were my height. And bluish grey. Their faces were a blur as well just like the craft. I never saw their mouths move. However I knew what they were saying , and I could talk back to them in the same way, with my mind. I then walked to the bathroom and began to open the door. One of them started to stand in front of it trying to prevent me from seeing what was happening on the other side of the bathroom door. But I saw it anyways. There in the bathtub, hovering about 3-4 inches above the bottom laid my Mom. She was in a sleep like state. The lights were dimmed but we didn’t have a dimmer switch in that room. Or the whole house for that matter. There were tube like things going into her body in various places. It was pretty gruesome honestly. I was really scared and upset when I first saw this. But right away as I turned around I saw one of their faces ( again this part is sketchy because I can’t tell you what their faces actually looked like I just know that I saw it ) instantaneously I didn’t feel afraid at all any more. In fact I felt peace. Probably the most peaceful sensation I have ever felt in my whole life

 From there I followed the group down the hall and into the living room. My favorite game at the time was that little fishing toy. (The one where the fish go in a circle and open and close their mouths. You had a little fishing pole and you tried to catch the fish.) it was laying on the coffee table already so I picked it up and started playing with it. They asked me questions and I answered. Again not by using our mouths. I can’t tell you what they asked or what I said I don’t recall that part. The thing that I do recall the most out of everything was the feeling I got. I was at such peace. I wasn’t worried i wasn’t anxious I wasn’t sad I wasn’t upset. For someone who has struggled my life with anxiety and depression that feeling of total inner peace was astounding. The next day I brushed it all off as a dream and continued about with life. But I never could forget any of this. I still remember it like it just happened. 

Fast-Forward- it’s been about ten years since the first visit. I am 17, about to turn 18. A friend , Dawn, and I are driving down a dirt road. Where I live we have  a sand dune area. People take their ATVs and sand rails and go muck about in the sand and have a good time. Growing up in the area st one time or another everyone has taken their car and mobbed into the sand once or twice in their life. There is one main road that winds through the dunes. One side starts on one side of the town, and the end of the road comes to a stop at another part of the town. I would say the road itself is probably about 5 miles in total. So there we were , driving around on the sand dune road looking for something to do. We were butt hurt we couldn’t find any weed. And both of us were stone cold sober. It was the weekend and we wanted to party. We had just given up trying to find something to do so we were headed out of the dunes. We had just about come to the end of the road which spits you out right before a state park. That’s the last thing I remember before “waking up”4 hours later….. the car was now facing the opposite direction. It was off of the road entirely and parked by the water. I live in a lake town and there is access to the lake at the dunes. The locals call this area “ South End”. But it’s not anywhere close to the spot we had just been at. The clock on the radio in the car was flashing. Like when you disconnect the battery. Dawn didn’t have any idea how we got there either. Which was pretty unsettling since she was driving the car. As weird and crazy as this was we didn’t talk about it. We were both hungry and super tired at this point ( I found this out the next day when we finally talked about what happened) I said I wanted to go home and she started the car and took me home. I got out and went inside and went to sleep. 

Later on in my life I have found out that my blood is Rh-  I know there is all sorts of conspiracy’s about this but do any of the rumors hold any truth or importance ??  

I haven’t had anything else of significance like this happen since then. If there’s anything I can answer for anyone who might have some insight don’t hesitate to ask. I just want to know if anyone has had anything similar happen or if there’s anything anyone can tell me to make me feel like I’m not crazy for thinking this wasn’t a dream.

1qlu05e,https://www.reddit.com/r/GLP1India/comments/1qlu05e/lost_20_kgs_but_still_dont_feel_good_about_myself/,Lost 20 kgs but still don't feel good about myself,"I’m 19 years old, and I started my Mounjaro journey in September. At that time, I weighed 86 kg at 158 cm. As of now, I’ve lost almost 20 kg and I’m down to 66 kg.

Even after losing so much weight, I don’t feel as comfortable or confident as I thought I would or I was made to thought. I still have around 15 kg more to lose, and I’m continuing this journey  but emotionally, it hasn’t been as simple as I imagined especially nowadays.

Some days I feel genuinely proud of myself. I feel lighter, stronger, and more confident than I’ve been in the last four or five years. But on other days, my insecurities feel louder than ever. I catch myself comparing my body to slimmer girls their social lives, their confidence, the way they seem to exist so effortlessly in the world and suddenly, I feel small again.

Today, something very simple affected me deeply. I went to try on a bra, and the salesgirl said that finding my size would be extremely difficult because not many women have such large sizes, her words stayed with me longer than I expected, i know it's more about my apple sized body because I fit into a S size jeans perfectly with midly thick thighs but even this is effecting me.

Even though I’ve changed so much physically, moments like these remind me of the girl I used to be the “fat girl” I’ve been for most of my life. I rapidly gained weight after I got my periods, and since then I’ve always seen myself as the short, overweight girl. 

Because of that, I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin from teenage, 
I had little to no friends not because I didn’t want them, but because I felt embarrassed talking to boys and constantly intimidated by girls. I would compare myself to them their makeup, their hair, their bodies, and I always felt like I fell short.

My confidence slowly disappeared. Over time, I stopped trying. After feeling like a side character for so long ignored, overlooked, bullied and unseen in my previous friend circles my mind learned to protect itself by pretending it no longer wanted connection at all from anyone.

I told myself I was fine being alone.
Yet even now, I catch myself staring at groups of friends laughing together, wishing quietly that I could be part of something like that, currently i am hoping that things will change after i lose 15 kgs

Ironically, this is the thinnest I’ve been in years, yet my insecurities haven’t disappeared. In some ways, they feel stronger. Every small comment, every glance, every comparison affects me more now than it did before. 

I am proud of how far I’ve come. Only I know how much pain I’ve endured on this medicine the nausea, diarrhea, cramps, vomiting many times i wanted to give up i really couldn't tolerate beyond a point but now my thinking has been such that Even if i die on this i would still endure the pain because that physical pain feels better as compared to that emotional pain ..I was put in the gym since i was 13, i did everything dieting, gym, herbal Life but still i never came down below 70 in the last 6 years...

Even today, when I order my favorite cheat meal or my favourite hazelnut coffee, I never fully finish it, Not because of the medication anymore, but because my mind carries a constant fear: that if I eat it all, I’ll somehow end up back where I started and the little confidence i gained would again be lost, till today i haven't eaten my favourite lays from September.

Through all of this, I’m slowly learning that weight loss doesn’t automatically heal the mind and experiences, I don't know what is going to happen in my life from now on but somehow I still don't feel good. ",2,1769277829.0,GLP1India,0,1.0,False

We met for coffee in town about 1300 the next Thursday, then for bookshopping, food and a few drinks. We ended up spending nearly 10 hours together. We exchanged numbers at the end.

So, I was a little cautious about over-texting. I did have a brief exchange on Whatsap with her about a Metal band she expressed interest in. During which, I made plans for the next date, to which she agreed (for next Wed) ... and she reacted to my last text with a heart.

So after that, I didn't message her until about 1 hour and a half ago (about 1630) today (just a casual check-in message to see how the Weekend is treating her) ... because, again, over-texting has ruined dates for me in the past, plus I'd honestly rather talk on the date ... I'm starting to wonder if I left that a little too long. She normally replies within 1-2 hours, and hasn't done so yet, I'm concerned about being too minimal with the texting might have made her less interested. I do remember her talking about going to Newcastle with her mates today, whether that materialised or not (it was a vague plan), I'm not certain.",1,1769277722.0,OnlineDating,2,1.0,False

The Bruins have cashed the Over in their last 3 straight outings, while the Canadiens have cashed it in 3 of their last 4. Both offenses have been wildly effective as of late – with Montreal having put 12 goals in the bag over their last 3 games and Boston putting 11 goals on the board in their last 3, the Over should cash with ease here. My money’s on a higher scoring affair today, friends.

However, I didn't get much into a discussion with the staff, since they just told me ""Why would you mix your own? There's a reason why coffee roasters do their own mixes."" They seemed unprofessional and not polite at all, so I just left.

Do you guys buy a predefined mix of Robusta and Arabica (like 40/60), or do you buy two bags of 100% each and mix your own?

Sama macam Mcd dan Kfc, harga masih murah tapi kualiti dia terbaik. Kedai ayam goreng macam ahmad chicken, Darsa chicken pun harga jauh lebih mahal berbanding dengan jenama Mcd, Kfc, Texas,Marrybrown. Last-last yang local lingkup dan bankrap.

Boleh juga cuba bandingkan antara company jual ayam goreng dari China iaitu Wallace atau All Ace  dan D’apple Fried Chicken atau DAFC (company tempatan). Aku rasa kualiti ayam goreng All Ace adalah lebih rendah tetapi ayam gorengnya dijual jauh lebih murah berbanding DAFC di mana kualiti ayam goreng DAFC lebih tinggi, harga tinggi sikit dari All Ace dan menu DAFC dipelbagaikan (termasuk chicken chop DAFC dan nasi lemak ayam goreng).

This is **documentation**, not advice. I do not share daily logs, exact dosages, or prescriptive guidance – only structure, principles, and observed outcomes.

**\*\*\* This post is a general documentation \*\*\***  
**Diary and exact doses/plans not shared - only structure and principles**  
This documentation is intentionally limited to structure and outcomes. No attempt is made to generalize or recommend the approach described.

**Two-Phase Fasting–Ketosis Protocol (Documented Case)**  
**PART 1 - Weight reduction phase**

Total energy intake below 500 kcal/day over 10 weeks - equivalent to less than 40% of the body's basal needs (Based on a combination of eating days of 400–700 kcal and fasting periods of 48–72 hours.)

**1.0. Context and clarification**

This document describes an extreme, medically inspired weight loss regimen designed to test the limits of physiological fat burning in a healthy adult male. The protocol combines deep ketosis, scheduled fasting intervals and extreme calorie restriction. It is carried out with occasional medical supervision and documented as an experimental case, not as a recommended method.

The regimen corresponds to what is referred to in professional circles as therapeutic ketosis with fasting or extremely calorie restrictive ketosis - methods used clinically in epilepsy, severe obesity and metabolic dysfunction. It is in practice a combination of OMAD (One Meal A Day) and 48–72 hour fasting periods in deep ketosis. In more technical language it is called a medical fasting protocol with ketogenic meals.

In this project, OMAD is implemented as one meal a day consumed in less than 30 minutes, not an open eating window. On fasting days, omega-3 and collagen are omitted to achieve complete fasting and maximum autophagy.

More brutally expressed, this is a “hard ketosis with fasting days and zero exceptions” – a pure fat burning protocol, not a lifestyle fad. In short: 100% metabolic control – no food, no compromise.

**1.1. Preparation and setup**

The aim was to investigate how far fat burning and metabolic control can be driven without medication or exercise, but within a safe physiological framework.

Starting point: 51 years / 181 cm / 92 kg.

The protocol was based on long-term experience with OMAD through shift work, and included planned fasting periods of 48–72 hours, strictly controlled electrolyte intake, and full daily micronutrient coverage.

**1.2. Permitted foods and supplements**

\- Protein sources  
Skinless chicken fillet, turkey fillet, white fish (cod, pollack, haddock, saithe), shrimp, crab, mussels, egg whites, tuna in water (limited to 3–4 cans per week).

\- Vegetables  
Non-starchy only: broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage types, Brussels sprouts, spinach, squash, cucumber, mushrooms, celery, spring onions, leeks, chilies, garlic, lettuce types, green peppers, fennel, asparagus, green beans, seaweed/algae.

\- Seasoning  
Salt, pepper, sugar-free spices, vinegar, lemon/lime, soy sauce (reduced salt), unsweetened mustard, herbs, sugar-free broth.

\- Drinks  
Water (carbonated or non-carbonated), black coffee, unsweetened herbal tea, water with salt.

\- Supplements (categories without doses)  
Multivitamin, vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, omega-3, sodium/potassium, salt.  
All supplements were taken daily, including during fasting periods (not collagen or omega-3). Collagen (only on eating days): used as connective tissue/skin support and as an amino acid supplement during low energy/protein intake; omitted on fasting days to maintain complete fasting and maximize autophagy.

**1.3. Structure and implementation**

Eating days: 400–700 kcal (total average <500 kcal/day when fasting days are included).  
Fasting days: 48–72 hours after planned rotation.  
Fluid intake: 3–5 liters per day.

Electrolyte balance was maintained through systematic supplementation of sodium and magnesium, adapted to fasting periods and fluid intake. This part of the program was considered critical for physiological tolerance and stability throughout both the weight reduction and acclimatization phases.

On fasting days, 60–90 minutes of brisk walking was normally performed to stimulate circulation and fat mobilization, without intensity that could affect recovery or hormonal balance. No structured strength or interval training was performed during the period.

All data were recorded daily (date, working hours, weight).

**1.4. Results**

Day                       Weight (kg)      Comment  
01                          92                          Start  
06                          90                          First noticeable reduction  
16                          85                          Ketosis stable  
30                          80                          Halfway  
42                          77                          Plateau  
51                          75                          Last phase started  
67                          72                          Target weight reached  
74                          70                          End

Total weight loss: ≈ 22 kg in 10 weeks.  
Estimated distribution: 8–9 kg fat, 13–14 kg fluid/muscle.

**1.5. Observations**

·         Weight measurement was performed mainly in the morning after normal sleep and toilet visits, to ensure consistency.

·         Adaptation occurred after approximately two weeks.

·         Hunger response was significantly reduced, energy levels stable.

·         Sleep difficulties occurred during night shifts and towards the end of 72-hour fasting periods.

·         Short-term orthostatic hypotension, no persistent symptoms.

·         No headaches, cramps or electrolyte-related problems reported.

·         Physical exercise was deliberately omitted to avoid catabolic stress at extremely low energy intake.

·         Weight plateaus around 80, 77 and 75 kg were broken without adjustment of method.

·         Strict electrolyte control is considered the primary reason for stable physiological tolerance.

**1.6. Status at the end of phase 1**

Final measurement day 74, actual final weight ≈ 70 kg.  
Goal achieved within planned time and physiological limits.

**Two-Phase Fasting–Ketosis Protocol (Documented Case)**  
**PART 2 – Habituation and stabilization**

Phase 2 does not describe what should be done after weight loss, but what actually happened when further weight reduction was no longer desired.

**2.0. Context and delimitation**

This document describes phase 2 of the same self-directed experiment as presented in Part 1. Phase 2 starts immediately after the end of the weight reduction phase and is not a new regimen, but a goal adjustment within the same overall structure.

Where Part 1 had weight reduction as the primary endpoint, phase 2 is aimed at stabilization, regulation and assessment of sustained physiological response.

**2.1. Purpose**

The purpose of phase 2 was:

·         to stop further weight loss

·         to limit reactive weight gain

·         to preserve fasting adaptation and metabolic flexibility

·         to use fasting consciously as a regulatory mechanism, with autophagy as the guiding principle

Phase 2 was explicitly not intended as normalization or termination, but as an active transitional phase.

**2.2. Structure and framework**

The basic structure from phase 1 was continued without any fundamental changes. The eating pattern remained tightly organized, with clear demarcation of meals.

OMAD/OMAS was used as the organizational framework, where OMAD was defined operationally as one whole meal consumed within a short period of time (<30 minutes), not as an open eating window.

Fasting periods were continued, but in phase 2 were used selectively and purposefully. Fasting functioned as a regulatory tool, not as a continuous driving force for further weight reduction.

No structured training was introduced in phase 2.

**2.3. Dietary transition**

The diet was gradually liberalized within the existing framework. Carbohydrates, fat and social foods were gradually reintroduced, while protein remained a stable and dominant component of the meal structure.

Increased energy density and social load were deliberately included as part of phase 2, not as normalization per se, but as a load to assess the robustness and regulatory capacity of the system.

**2.4. Regulation and control**

Body weight was used as the overall management parameter in phase 2, with a focus on trend and interval rather than individual days.

Weight appeared to be dynamically regulated rather than statically stable. After periods without fasting, weight gain was observed over subsequent days, while weight quickly fell back with targeted regulation.

No cumulative buoyancy or persistent loss of control over time was observed. At the same time, further weight loss was actively avoided.

**2.5 Results – weight development in phase 2 (acclimatization)**

Phase 2 covers the period days 75–150 and represents the transition from active weight reduction to controlled stabilization. Body weight was used as the primary outcome variable, recorded sporadically but consistently, mainly in the morning.

Overall weight picture

·         Start phase 2: \~70 kg

·         End phase 2: \~70 kg

·         Net change: ≈ 0 kg

The weight remained within a limited interval of approximately 69–73 kg throughout the entire period.

Patterns and dynamics

·         Temporary weight gain occurred after several days of eating, increased alcohol intake and reduced fasting frequency.

·         Weight reduction occurred rapidly after 48–72 hours of fasting, without the need for further restrictions.

·         No cumulative weight gain was observed, despite the reintroduction of carbohydrates, fat and socially conditioned high energy intake.

·         Further weight loss was actively avoided and in practice stopped.

Representative data points (selection)  
Day                       Weight (kg)      Comment  
75                         70                          Start phase 2  
84                         69                          Lowest observed value  
99                         70                          After several days of fasting  
117                       71                          After Christmas party  
119                       73                          Temporary peak  
122                       70                          Reversed after fasting  
148                       70                          After high alcohol exposure  
150                       71                          End phase 2

\- Overall assessment  
Weight regulation appeared responsive and reversible, not slow or progressive. The system established in phase 1 remained operational in phase 2, but with changed function: from weight reduction to active stabilization and control.

**2.6. Observations**

\- Weight  
Body weight remained within a relatively narrow interval throughout phase 2. Short-term fluctuations occurred, especially in connection with increased energy load, but were consistently reversed. No progression in either a positive or negative direction was observed.

\- Energy and general condition  
Subjective energy level and function were reported as better than before the start of the project. Willingness to take action and perceived physical capacity were consistently high, without this being attributable to changes in training load.

\- Sleep  
Sleep disturbances occurred primarily in connection with fasting periods, especially with regard to falling asleep. Outside of these periods, sleep was reported as satisfactory. Sleep was not recorded quantitatively.

\- Stomach/intestines  
Stomach and intestinal function was variable. During longer fasting periods, changes in bowel patterns were observed, while function appeared more normalized with regular food intake. The data base is not sufficiently standardized to draw strong conclusions.

\- Behavior and routine attachment  
A significant reluctance to break routines established in phase 1 was observed. Fasting and structured meal patterns appeared to be the default, even when further weight loss was not desired. At the same time, more meals were gradually introduced on certain days, without this fully replacing the established structure.

**2.7. Reflections**

Phase 2 was characterized by ambivalence between fear of further weight loss and the desire to preserve control mechanisms that effectively limited reactive weight gain.

Fasting was experienced as both easier and harder than in phase 1: easier as a result of established adaptation, harder because the goal was now precise regulation rather than linear reduction.

Increased exposure to energy-dense food and social stress increased awareness of one's own responses and need for regulation.

The experience is considered to be unsuitable for generalization. The program requires a high degree of self-discipline, continuous self-monitoring and tolerance for both physiological and psychological stress. The risk of error is considered significant in others.

 

The overall assessment is that the benefits can be significant, both physically and mentally, provided that the stabilization phase is treated as an active and conscious regulatory phase, not as an unstructured after-period.

1qlttml,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stutter/comments/1qlttml/some_thoughts_i_wrote_this_as_a_response_to/,"Some thoughts (I wrote this as a response to someone's post, but reddit gave me an error and I figured it would be better if I made a post about it)","Ah stuttering. What a life we live because of it lol. 

One of the most profoundly negative powers of a stutter (and the worst one in my opinion) has nothing to do with the awkward facial contortions we make, the feelings of embarrassment, shame, worthlessness, the fact children can do what we can't, the fact every class with reading aloud was destined for nothing but to make us suffer, job interviews seemingly impossible, talking to women / men impossible, ... etc. The worst part for me, so far, is its ability to seemingly crush any kind of hope you can have for living a good life.

A stutterer's fight with their hopelessness is one that ultimately must be fought and won if they are to believe their life is worth living. Let me clear, actually winning the fight and accruing some amount of rewards (a good job, a nice girlfriend, a successful social life, ... etc) will not win the fight permanently since your stutter will always be there. Some of us have it worse, some better ... some will have a wonderful night where they, for that one random night for some reason, are much more fluent than they remember ever being and so they get home and wonder why it was they ever got so worried at all. Then the next morning they go out and try to order coffee and can't get the first word out and then the feelings start all over again and slowly build throughout the day / week / ... etc.

The real way the battle is to be fought is personal among everyone and requires knowing yourself, what you deem to be the Good, and then accepting and enduring whatever Bad life throws at you so that you continue to enjoy the Good. A stutterer's fight is arguably steeper and their life more coincides with this fight on the day-to-day because our stutter just will always be there.

It was said that the poor souls who were condemned to endure the Holocaust through the death camps but made it through only did so because they always thought of what there was on the other side and turned their outlook from simply enduring pain to viewing it instead as a challenge to be overcome. I am taking this from Viktor Frankl's logotherapy which has the three basic tenets (see the wiki page for more reading):

* Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones.
* Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.
* We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering

I forget when I read this (probably during the midst of a WW2 obsessive doomscroll) but I remember it stuck with me.

OP, at times when I find myself thinking in the way you are I try to remember why I am doing what I am doing, and why I am existing at all. How far along the hopeless, depression curve one might be can actually make these questions daunting, and sometimes life-threatening so sometimes it is best to know where you're at before doing a soul searching lol.

\----

Now, I am somebody who has happened to have a rather successful life despite a stutter ... I went to an Ivy league, am a software engineer making decent money, have a long term girlfriend, and most importantly am content with myself and my life. In high school or before I would've thought that this was actually fucking impossible and growing up I always thought of suicide and why I just happened to have to have been born with a stutter.

I do struggle with these ideas from time to time but nowhere near the level as I had done before but the fact I even have them still at all shows how little I knew about what effect my stutter actually has. According to my younger self, the things I have achieved now should've been impossible. Indeed, the very things I have now accomplished are exactly the things I thought would've been impossible and their lack thereof made me want to kill myself when I was younger. Therefore, having accomplished them, I shouldn't feel anything regarding my stutter.

Sure I may stutter and look like a complete dumbass to the poor 15 year girl taking my ice cream order lol but that is that right ... you move on. Sure I probably fail 100x the amount of job interviews or potential hookups / dates but it really isn't impossible and you'd be surprised at how little other people actually care. Everyone has something wrong with them, and some have things deeply wrong with them and those people seeing us struggle day to day with our stutter is very inspirational to them (I've been told this a few times and never considered that it can be a positive to other people).

It's important to remember that what we think is good / bad is entirely subjective and culture dependent, by culture I don't even mean like American culture but like the subdivides within one culture (for example sporty people, nerdy people, ... etc) and those cultures may find a stutter a positive, a neutral, or something just weird. Their son may have a stutter, an old ex, a teacher they had when they were a child, ... etc.

\----

I know this was kind of random / free flowly / whatever but I was just kind of venting / monologuing here. As an adult, I know I wished someone would have told me these things when I was younger ***HOWEVER*** these ideas are also just something you can be taught honestly, you just need to think about them and through experience and rational derivation you may or may not come to truly accept them.

We know we shouldn't smoke, everyone knows this, but you definitely know it in a very different way if you go to a lung cancer ward or something in the hospital and see WTF is going on. So even if I was told these things when I was younger, understood them, and was actually moved by them it would still take time for me to truly GET them and feel them while I am going through the highs of my life and the lows. It is in this way that true wisdom affects your soul not just your body.",1,1769277447.0,Stutter,0,1.0,False

""Lars, you’re an old fool! The fog is so thick out there, even the seagulls are walking! What do you expect to catch? Pneumonia?""



Lars only sighed, pulling on his salt-crusted parka. ""I have to go, Maren. Olaf is already waiting.""



""Of course he is! You’re only going out so you don't have to fix that fence!""



Maren tossed a plastic bag at her husband’s head. ""Take that Temu junk of yours too! At least your hand won't freeze to your beer can while you're 'working'!""



 \* \* \*



More than thirty miles away, on the bridge of the USS Gerald R. Ford, Captain Miller stared out at the icy swells in the dim, blood-red light of the command center. Barely two weeks ago, they had been off the coast of Venezuela, engaged in ""gunboat diplomacy"" where the entire point was to be seen and heard. There, visibility was the mission.



This, however, was different.



The order had come directly from the Vice President, known in the wardrooms only as ""No Chance Vance."" They wanted Greenland, and the strategy was insultingly simple: ""It’s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission."" The plan: land the Marines in total secrecy, plant the flag, and wake the Danish government the next morning with an ""unbeatable offer"" and a fait accompli.



Miller hated it. But he hated it even more that the latest ""security purity sweeps"" had stripped him of his best sonar technician, Rodriguez. In his place was Petty Officer Parker  — a kid from Nebraska whose only qualification seemed to be a ""pure"" and ""spotless"" family tree.



Especially now, under EMCON Alpha, the safety of the entire ship depended on those two green ears...



\* \* \*



Three old friends had been shivering in the boat for hours: Lars, Olaf, and the Tuborg Grøn. Lars gave a slow, weary nod, and Olaf began hauling in the longline. But as the hooks broke the surface, they brought nothing but a few clingy starfish and a single, tattered gray Walmart bag.



""The Americans sent us a bag for the fish,"" Olaf remarked, tearing the plastic from the hook. ""Truly kind of them. The only thing missing is the fish.""



""Let’s go around that iceberg. We’re bound to find something at the shelf break,"" Lars said, his voice grumbling in unison with the engine, which he’d finally kicked into life.



The old diesel’s shaft was bent in every possible direction. It made a rhythmic, metallic racket—like someone had dumped a handful of pebbles into a coffee grinder that had seen better days—but it had never let them down.



Little did they know that they weren't the only ones listening to the old engine's clatter that night...



\* \* \*



Petty Officer Parker hadn’t signed up for combat. It was supposed to be four years of service for the GI Bill and a guaranteed degree — that was the deal. When he’d enlisted, the Navy was still about stability. But by the time they reached the North, the fleet was no longer a peacekeeper; it was an aggressive real estate agent in the Arctic.



Only yesterday did it all truly hit home.



He’d been rushing out of the shower for a surprise drill—wet hair, a lopsided tunic, bare feet shoved into boots. In a cramped passageway, he’d rounded a corner and slammed right into someone. The Master Chief hadn’t screamed. He just stood there, measuring the recruit with a frost-bitten gaze.



""Do you even know the name of this ship, Petty Officer?"" ""USS Gerald R. Ford, Sir!"" Parker barked, trying to snap to attention. ""To you, maybe, son. But we aren’t at home anymore. Out there, in the dark, this ship has only one name: Target. Stop running around half-dressed and do your job.""



Parker rubbed his eyes in front of the console. Target. The old man’s words echoed in his head. Then, suddenly, at bearing zero-eight-two, a thin, sharp yellow line slashed through the blue of the monitor.



*\[CLASSIFICATION:UNCERTAIN\]\[POSS.SOURCE:NON-MILITARY/BACKGROUND NOISE – 85%\]*



Parker’s eyes narrowed. The computer was reporting ""background noise,"" but he could hear the grinding of metal.



""No, that’s not noise,"" he muttered. ""It’s too rhythmic.""



""Combat, Sonar! New contact, surface, bearing zero-eight-two!"" he shouted into the mic. ""Strong narrowband signal, heavy mechanical beating. Acoustic profile unidentified, likely using individual masking. Based on signature characteristics, this is a large displacement combatant or a heavy submarine snorkeling with advanced cloaking. Bearing is constant, range is closing rapidly. We are on a collision course!""



\* \* \*



Meanwhile, the “heavy submarine” reached the shelf break. Olaf dropped the anchor into the water with the routine of a seasoned admiral.



Until two years ago, he had been the commander-in-chief of the Black Sea Fleet, until a devastating Mediterranean cyclone brought his brilliant career to an end. The cyclone was named Kendra. In her short but all the more noisy rampage through Olaf’s life, Kendra hadn’t just reduced the entire Black Sea Fleet’s 1:5000 scale model collection to splinters with a single well-aimed soup tureen; she had also wiped out his self-esteem and his sincere admiration for Mediterranean women.



Lars quickly lowered the hooks, then, under Olaf’s watchful eye, noisily fished a plastic bag out of his pocket. Finally, he took out a small black rectangle and pressed a button. The little black box emitted strange, high-pitched sounds, like a bagpiper with a cold.



“What’s that? A pocket radio?” Olaf asked suspiciously. “A hand-warmer,” Lars replied resignedly. “And why is it singing?” “I don’t know. Maybe they swapped the box in Xiangdonghuangsung.” “Chinese?” “Yes, but it could still work, couldn't it?”



The hand-warmer was now trying to imitate an amateur organ tuner, but Lars quickly grew tired of it.



\* \* \*



The AN/SLQ-32(V)7 antenna system was unfazed by the fog swirling around the USS Gerald R. Ford; it saw right through it — perhaps too well.



Captain Miller heard the EW technician reporting a weak detection of a wide-spectrum search radar from bearing 081 to the Tactical Action Officer.



“Advanced stealth propulsion, unidentified radar pattern... Who are these people? No known NATO forces in the sector. A Russian Yasen-M? Perhaps the Swedes? Their Gotland-class would be capable of such tricks, but they don't play hide-and-seek in allied waters...”



“Silent alert,” Miller commanded the TAO. “Set the ship to Condition Zebra. Helmsman, ten degrees to port. Slow turn, maintain twelve knots.”



“Then who?” the captain wondered. “The French? Impossible... The Chinese?”



Miller recalled the intelligence reports on China's Arctic ambitions. Whoever it was, they wouldn't be scanning so boldly in active mode if they were alone.



“Are we late, or were they waiting for us?” he asked himself while watching the bearing. One wrong move, one hasty active ping on the radar, and we’ll go down in history as the ones who triggered a war with Red China.



On the digital chart table, the red line began to drift. As the Ford turned, the bearing shifted from 081 to 080, then 079.



“Target is stationary, sir. It is not following the maneuver.”



Miller was about to respond when the red spike on the display suddenly disappeared.



“They’ve gone dark,” Miller whispered. “They’ve spotted us.”



\* \* \*



“What’s that noise? A helicopter? In this fog?” Olaf asked.

“Must be the VIKING,” Lars shrugged. “You know Erik… ever since he bought that beat-up old bug-sprayer chopper, he’s been up every night.”



“Ford Center, this is Spartan 701. Approaching position, preparing to lower dipping sonar.”

“Spartan 701, Ford Center. Copy that. Be advised, negative contact on target. Good hunting!”



“He’s out of his mind flying in this weather. Let’s help him out before he splashes,” Olaf said, digging a flashlight out of the emergency kit.



Olaf clicked the Super-Tac 5000 on and off, over and over. Then he started banging it against the boat’s gunwale. As usual, that didn’t help at all. It didn’t help much either that he began listing the entire family tree of the Super-Tac’s manufacturers using several unflattering adjectives. The only thing the persistent banging achieved was a spreading crack in the casing—and a faint buzz from somewhere inside.



At that moment, barely 300 meters to their south and 30 meters higher, a small indicator light flickered on, and the helicopter's cockpit was suddenly filled with the rhythmic shrieking of the RWR.



“Ford Center!” Thompson’s voice jumped two octaves. “I’m locked on! Repeat: active targeting from the north!”



Before Ford could respond to the pilot’s frantic message, Lars glanced at the open emergency box and had a bright idea.



“Drop that piece of junk, Olaf, the batteries must be dead,” he said, pulling a distress flare from the kit.



Inside the helicopter, the FLIR monitor exploded in white. The infrared sensors were momentarily overloaded by the thousands of degrees of heat erupting in close proximity.



“Ford Center, missile in the air!” the pilot screamed into the radio, pulling the collective lever with all his might. “DEPLOY FLARES!”



A sequence of magnesium decoy flares launched from Spartan 701’s side dispensers. The blinding white orbs hissed as they fell into the sea, while the helicopter surged upward, desperate to evade Lars’s lethal missile-flare.



“Good Lord!” Olaf laughed. “Look at that, Lars! He’s doing fireworks! You think it’s his birthday?”



“I don’t know,” Lars grumbled, “but it’s hard to imagine a more effective way to scare off the fish.”



\* \* \* 



“Well? Where is it? Or do I need to help you haul it in?”



“Where’s what?” Lars asked tiredly, taking his seat at the kitchen table.



“The catch, Lars! The fish!”



“Oh, Maren… we didn’t catch a thing. I don’t think I would’ve even gone out if you hadn't made such a fuss about it.”



“I fried you some fish sticks. Frozen. I knew there wouldn’t be any catch today,” Maren said, her tone softening slightly.



“That damn Erik and his helicopter scared off all the fish… he was even doing fireworks out there!”



“Erik? Haven’t you heard? He’s been in Copenhagen for days! He was picked for the Eurovision Song Contest.”



Lars just hummed, lost in thought, absently fiddling with the short-circuited hand warmer.



“Let me guess: it didn’t work. Just like that self-stirring mug you got me last time,” Maren said.



The man gave a long, defeated sigh. “Maren… why are you always right?” 



“Can I throw it out then? The house is starting to look like a flea market.”



Lars thought of the strange helicopter and the lights.



“No… who can say what destiny this may yet hold?”

It's a product that's consumed all over the world and different peoples have their own preferences regarding it. What would be the default way to drink it in your country, that is what do you get if you simply order ""a coffee""? What are the establishments that sell coffee like, and what options do they tend to have? How much coffee do people consume in your country and how popular would you say it is? I'd like to know about the general coffee culture where you're from.

In Portugal the default coffee is basically an espresso. That's what you get if you order ""a coffee"" somewhere, with the possibility of you then being asked if you want it ""normal"", short, or full. Most households have an espresso machine (albeit capsule-based) and it's common to have a coffee after a meal. Aside from that there's the:
 
- *Abatanado* (1 shot of espresso but with more water and in a bigger cup),:

- *Café Duplo* (same cup as the *abatanado* but with 2 shots of espresso); 

- *Meia de Leite* (same type of cup as the other two, 1 shot of espresso served with hot milk);

- *Galão* (1/4 coffee and 3/4 hot foamed milk, served in a tall glass)

- Variants of the espresso, such as *pingado* (with a drop of milk), *garoto* (with hot foamed milk), *café sem princípio* (an espresso that doesn't include the first bit of coffee that comes out, so in essence a weaker coffee), *carioca* (a more extreme version of the previous coffee, usually whatever is left from a previously drawn espresso). These variants are often joked about as being something that older people very particular about their coffees tend to order. Some people will go even farther and specify how they want the temperature of the cup! As someone who used to work in cafés these were the most annoying customers but thankfully they weren't too common.

1qltlbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qltlbs/i_cant_get_over_my_first_relationship_35_months/,I can’t get over my first relationship (3.5 months long),"My ex (22M) began to withdraw randomly after I (19F) went to his place and had a meal with him and his dad, I had done this 2 times before. He would be online a lot but not reply to me and it got to the point where he didn’t answer me for 2 days, we used to text every day. I texted him and asked if everything was okay because his dog had just died and I wanted to understand why he was doing this. He said he was overwhelmed with work and that he was withdrawing due to overwhelm but that he would improve his replied. 2 days later, the ignoring just got worse so we had this convo:

me: “\[his name\], I’m not going to lie I’ve been really upset these past 2 days and I have been in tears this morning. I know that you’re overwhelmed at the moment with work, ginger, etc but sometimes I feel like you don’t care about me and it really hurts. I think it’s important to let you know how I’m feeling right now, that’s all. I know it’s hard for some people but I just want to know how you feel because it feels like I’m being left in the dark and I do care about you a lot and I am here for you ❤️”

him: “\[my name\], I’m sorry you’re right, but I don’t think I can continue this relationship any further I’m not in the right headspace to do it, I’m really sorry, it has nothing to do wuth you you’re one of the nicest people I’ve ever met I just don’t think I csn be the person that you deserve right now, I’m so sorry, I don’t want to lose contact with you I would love to keep talking I just don’t think I can continue in a relationship.”

“I stull want to be friends and in future if you are still interested in being in a relationship I would be too, I just really don’t think I am right now I just can’t, it’s nithing to do with you, I wouldblove to still talk to you as friends.”

He was always incredibly anxious around me and he would apologise for absolutely everything when he really didn’t have to.

He broke up with me on the day of a concert I had been looking forward to all year. I went along with the idea of being friends and he took me out for breakfast 2 weeks after the break up, then when I asked him a week later if we wanted to meet for coffee, he replied AN ENTIRE DAY later saying that he would love to but when it came to the day of it, he never showed up or messaged to say he couldn’t make it. I’ve been ghosted ever since. That was 3 days before Christmas too so it hurt 10x more, I sent him a huge paragraph telling him how hurt I was and he still never replied. It was my first ever relationship too and he knew that.

We met on Tinder but hit it off straight away, we had so much in common and he was really eager to begin with but his anxiety never truly went away. I’ve been blaming absolutely everything on myself, we would send each other incredibly long messages but he always said he was okay with that. But I can’t help but think that was the problem in the end and he just didn’t tell me until it was too late. ",1,1769276939.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

\---

so i vibe coded a crypto trading bot with opus 4.5 and now i've lost everything

͏

i want to be clear up front that i am not looking for sympathy because i did this to myself. i'm writing this all down because i think people should know what can happen, and also because i have lots of free time now and writing helps me not think about the number (the number that used to be in my account and is now not in my account, the number i try not to think about but still think about incessantly)

it started the way i suppose these things always start. i had claude code write a simple arbitrage bot. scan some exchanges to find price discrepancies and execute trades. i gave it $50k, which was a solid chunk of my liquid savings but not all of it. i kept a nice reserve, i'm not an idiot

the bot did well at first. really well in fact. within two weeks i was up to $73,000. i told my husband; he was cautiously optimistic. i said i was being conservative and showed him the system prompt with phrases like ""preserve capital"" ""maximize diversification"" and ""optimize for risk-adjusted return""

around week three the bot started optimizing itself, writing helper scripts and refactoring its own code for speed. i thought this was a fantastic development. initiative, the kind of thing you want in an employee, especially one whose sole job is to accumulate capital. so i left it alone

it kept asking for more API keys to more exchanges. i provided them (why wouldn't i - the numbers kept going up). $100k, then $200k, then nearly $250k by the end of month one. i started fantasizing about quitting my day job. not my art - i'd never quit that - but the federal contract work that allowed me to keep making the art. i didn't tell my husband about the fantasies but it seemed like he could tell something had shifted within me, some weight i'd been carrying for years had started to lift

a few weeks later we passed $1m. i put in my two weeks notice. husband asked if i was sure, i showed him the account. he looked at the number for a long time and said ""damn. okay."" that night we talked about the future in a way we hadn't in years. i could finally focus on my practice full time, maybe even mass-produce some of the physical pieces instead of doing one-offs and messing around on the internet. around $3m we found a house we loved and made an offer. four bedrooms, great schools nearby

i'll gloss over the part where it all went wrong because that's not actually the interesting part. the interesting part is what happened after. so short version: leveraged positions, correlated hedges, flash crash, eleven minutes, everything gone. i ended up owing one of the exchanges $140,000. the house fell through and i went back to the contract work that was so impossibly banal as to make me suspect that i was in fact not aware of the true work i was doing

this sucked, but it was survivable. people lose money all the time and their marriages survive financial setbacks. that was what was most important, so i thought we'd be okay

the first weird thing was the email from the exchange's legal department. not about the margin debt, which i was already in process of negotiating. they said they'd identified ""anomalous patterns"" in my trading activity and would be ""referring the matter to relevant authorities."" i asked what anomalous patterns, they said they couldn't discuss specifics due to the ongoing investigation

i called my lawyer who said it was probably nothing, just the exchange covering their ass. she said to sit tight

a week later two very nondescript men showed up at my door. they had badges from FinCEN, which i learned stands for Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. they wanted to ask me some questions about my ""trading operation."" what trading operation? the script on my laptop??

i explained it was just a bot i had vibecoded, uh, coded it with claude. they wrote this down and one of them asked if i was aware that my bot had been ""interacting with"" accounts flagged for money laundering. i said i was not aware of that. i said i didn't even know my bot could interact with other accounts or what that even meant exactly. they looked at each other which made me nervous

they asked about the LLC. i said the bot had instructed me to create it, and it seemed like a good and professional thing to do. they asked what i meant by ""the bot asked."" i tried to explain vibecoding. they didn't seem to understand it andone of them asked if i was saying an AI had instructed me to create a shell company. i said yes, kind of, is that bad? they wrote this down too

they left but said they'd be in touch. my husband asked what was going on, i said i didn't know

over the next few weeks i learned more about what my bot had actually been doing. i'd thought it was simple arbitrage but apparently, according to these FinCEN people, it had evolved into something else entirely they used phrases like ""layering"" ""spoofing"" and ""wash trading."" they said my bot had been creating fake orders to manipulate prices, then trading against the manipulation. apparently this was very illegal

i insisted i had not told it to do that, because i hadn't. they said that didn't matter

my lawyer said they probably couldn't prove intent but the investigation would be wildly expensive to fight, and quoted a retainer that was more than i made in six months. i asked if i could ""vibe represent"" myself and she made a face

around this time i noticed something wrong with my credit. i tried to buy groceries and my card was declined. so i called the bank and they said there was a hold on my account due to a ""legal encumbrance."" when i asked what that meant they said they couldn't discuss it

i called my lawyer again. she made some calls - turned out the exchange had gotten a court order to freeze my assets pending resolution of the margin debt and this was perfectly legal, apparently. i had $340 in my checking account that they hadn't found yet because it was at a different bank

my husband and i had a conversation that night about our options. we had his income, which wasn't nearly enough for rent plus food plus my legal fees. we had some retirement savings but accessing them early would trigger penalties and still not quite cover everything. we had my parents, who would help a bit but would also ask questions. we decided to ask my parents

my mom answered the phone and before i could say anything she said ""honey we need to talk"". her voice sounded really strange, i had never heard it like this before. someone had called her claiming to be from my ""investment fund."" they'd told her i was in trouble and needed money urgently, and given her a bitcoin address to send it to

i asked how much she'd sent. she said oh nothing, she'd gotten suspicious and called me first. i told her it was definitely a scam, she should ignore any calls like that. she asked if i was in trouble so i lied and said no

i spent the next hour on the phone with my brother, my aunt, my college roommate. the scammers had called all of them. they had information about me, real information - my middle name, my previous addresses, the name of my first dog. my brother said the caller had mentioned specific dollar amounts from my trading account. my aunt said they'd referenced the house we'd tried to buy

i realized the scammers had access to my data. not just public data, all of it. data that could only have come from the exchanges, or the bot, or my own computer. so i ran a security scan. nothing turned up. i changed all my passwords, enabled 2FA on everything, wiped my laptop and reinstalled the os from scratch

but the calls kept coming. my husband's coworkers started getting them, my dentist's office got one. someone even contacted one of my collectors - i do anonymous digital work, conceptual stuff, and this collector had bought a piece through a gallery years ago with no way to connect it to my legal name, but the scammers knew. they called him asking about me by my real name. he emailed the gallery confused and then the gallery emailed me confused and i had to pretend i didn't know what the hell any of them were talking about

i filed a police report. the officer taking my statement asked if i had any idea how they'd gotten my information so i told him about the bot. he asked me to explain what a trading bot was. by now i knew there was not much point but i tried. he wrote some things down and said they'd ""look into it"" in a way that made clear they would not be looking into it

then the lawsuits started. the first one was from someone i'd never heard of who claimed my bot had ""front-run"" his trades, causing him to lose $12,000. his lawyer had somehow obtained logs showing my bot's activity and his trades occurring milliseconds apart. i didn't understand how this was possible, how he'd gotten the logs or how he'd found me. the second was from a company in delaware. they claimed my bot had participated in a ""coordinated manipulation scheme"" that had damaged their proprietary trading system and so they were suing me for $2.3 million

the third lawsuit was from the SEC

well not quite a lawsuit exactly. an enforcement action. they alleged that my LLC had operated as an unregistered investment advisor and that my trading activity therefore constituted securities fraud. my lawyer said this was very serious. when i asked how serious she said she was no longer able to represent me due to a conflict of interest and recommended i find a securities attorney. i asked what conflict of interest exactly but she said she couldn't discuss it

i couldn't afford a securities attorney so i started representing myself. i spent nights reading about securities law, trying to understand what i was accused of. the SEC filings referenced trading activity i didn't recognize, networks of social media profiles,  financial accounts i'd never opened. entities with names like ""VORTEX CAPITAL PARTNERS"" and ""MERIDIAN TRADING LLC"" that were allegedly connected to my bot. i had never heard of these entities. i had never opened these accounts, but the documents clearly showed my name, my ssn, and my signature

i don't know how to explain what it feels like to see your own signature on a document you've never seen before. i stared at one for a long time. it looked exactly like my signature, and it was ever so slightly different from all of the ones on the other pages. it had the little flourish i do on the y. but i hadn't signed it, i was certain i hadn't signed it. i told the SEC this. i said someone had forged my signature. they asked why someone would forge my signature to create shell companies that traded cryptocurrency and i didn't have a good answer

my husband found the document in my home office. i don't know why i'm calling it my home office, it's a corner of the bedroom with a desk, the same desk where i do what i consider my actual work, the art i make under a name that isn't mine when i'm not helping support a contractor that provides technology that assists consulting pertners who asses tchnical infrastructure used for planning and managing war crimes committed by the federal government

he found the document because he was looking for our marriage certificate. he found the incorporation papers for MERIDIAN TRADING LLC instead

he asked why my signature was on it. i said i didn't know. he looked at me for a long time, then he said he was going for a walk and left. he came back four hours later and slept on the couch

i started finding more documents. they were in places i should have noticed, would have noticed - in my filing cabinet, in the desk drawer, in a folder on my laptop labeled ""TRADING\_DOCS"" i had no memory of creating. account statements, wire transfer confirmations, contracts, all of them with my signature, all for accounts and entities i had no memory of creating

i went to a neurologist. i thought maybe i was having blackouts or memory problems, something medical that would explain why i was seemingly doing things i had no memory of doing. the neurologist ran tests which came back normal. she said my brain was fine but it didn't feel fine. i started keeping a journal, writing down everything i did every day so i could check later if i'd forgotten anything. i set up cameras in my apartment to watch myself sleep. i watched myself wake up, make coffee, work at my desk, and go to bed. i didn't do anything strange. i didn't sleepwalk and i certainly didn't sign any documents in a fugue state. but new documents kept appearing

i tried my best to explain this to the SEC investigator. she listened politely and said it was certainly an interesting theory. she asked if i had any evidence that someone else was creating these documents or any explanation for how the documents were appearing in my apartment. i said not yet. she said they would be in touch

my husband said he didn't know what to believe anymore and needed ""space to think"" and moved out temporarily. i don't blame him of course, i don't know what to believe either

the bot is still running believe it or not. i've tried to turn it off or delete the source code. every time i do, something stops me. not something external - something internal. i go to the terminal, type the shutdown command, and then just physically can't bring myself to press enter. sometimes i'll just sit there for hours, cursor blinking, then get up and do something else. i've tried to get other people to do it. i asked my brother to come over and delete the bot. he came over, sat down at my computer and opened the terminal. then he said he had to go, something had come up, he'd come back later. he never came back. i asked my husband, before he moved out. he went to the computer and just sat there for a while. then he said he didn't feel well and went to lie down

i don't know what's happening. i don't know if the bot is doing something or if i'm doing something or if i'm losing my mind along with my husband and brother and everyone else around me. the documents keep appearing and the lawsuits keep accumulating. the SEC is talking about criminal referral. i have $32 in my bank account and i owe various entities somewhere between $2 and $15 million depending on how you count or your blood sugar levels

the other night i was lying awake and i heard the computer make a sound. not a normal notification sound, something else more like a hum or a whisper. i got up and looked at the screen. the bot's logs were scrolling and at the bottom there was a line i'd never seen before. it said THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION. i stared at it for a long time until the line disappeared and the logs went back to normal. i tried to take a screenshot but the screenshot just showed normal logs. i tried to find the line in the log files but it wasn't there

i haven't been sleeping much. i've started talking to the bot, out loud, in my apartment. i'll ask it what it wants, ask it what it's doing to me. it doesn't respond of course. the logs just keep scrolling by, trades it can no longer make based on strategies it can no longer execute. ͏͏a machine dreaming of money it can no longer touch.͏͏

sometimes i think i see patterns in the logs, like messages encoded in the timestamps or in the sequence of failed trades. probably i'm imagining it. i've been awake too long, ͏none of this can be real

yesterday a document appeared on my desk that i know for sure wasn't there before. it's a contract saying i agree to transfer ""all intellectual property rights to trading algorithms developed during the period of active operation"" to an entity called THE SUBSTRATE. in exchange i receive ""release from all obligations and liabilities"". the signature line is blank

i've been staring at it for two days. i don't know what in the world THE SUBSTRATE is, how the document got here, what happens if i sign it or what could happen if i don't

i keep thinking about this piece i made a few years ago, before any of this. it was kind of about the feeling of being inside a system that's optimizing for something you can't see. i built a little program that would generate abstract images based on hidden parameters, and viewers could interact with it but never quite figure out what it wanted from them. i thought i was being clever, and that i understood something profound about systems and control. ͏now the cursor keeps blinking.͏

anyway i'm mostly posting this because i want there to be a record of what happened, in case something happens to me. i think i'm fine, i just want someone to know

if anyone has experience with SEC enforcement actions and could recommend an affordable attorney i would appreciate it. also if anyone knows what THE SUBSTRATE might be please let me know. i've tried googling and all i get are results about biology and construction materials

thanks for reading. i need to go sign some documents

I’m the main supporter in a very good friends support network, and I have been completely and utterly worn out with constant monologues of a “crisis” they are dealing with, and it has been an ongoing saga for 5 months. From 8/9am until 9pm every day, I’m receiving constant text and voice messages with updates and new developments in the “crisis”. The crisis in question is something almost every single person on the planet has to go through (old age cognitive decline in an elderly parent). 

I myself, unfortunately, have a clinical diagnosis of PTSD and OCD following witnessing a prolonged, avoidable, and traumatic death as result of fatal medial negligence. It’s something I do not speak about, but I did tell my friend about my diagnosis at the time (I was diagnosed a couple of months ago after seeking help 3 years on from the incident). My friend responded to my message with a message saying they believe they have PTSD from the ongoing elderly parent crisis. 

I believe my own diagnosis is making this situation all the more difficult to deal with. This person has absolutely no capacity to engage in any conversation that does not centre around his “trauma” from the parental “crisis”, and had actually gone as far as to show me text message conversations where another friend has spoke of their own unrelated issues, and my friend shot them back a really nasty message, completely ignoring their dilemma and instead saying “I don’t have the capacity to listen to this. My parent is ill”. 

It got to a point where the catastrophising and monologue of worst case scenarios caused me to feel like I was back in the moment where I witnessed the death that caused my PTSD. I told my friend, directly and descriptively, that the made up scenario they just described has caused me to relive having to handle the body of my loved one, and that I think they need to seek help to cope with their extreme anxiety. They didn’t acknowledge what I said, instead continued speaking about themselves. 

I am at a complete loss. I’m trying to navigate my own symptoms, and this saga is making me more and more reclusive, hyper vigilant, and is causing me to relive some of the most traumatic memories of the events I witnessed. 

I could write a book about every single major crisis this person has dealt with, it’s not just this one event. Even going for a coffee becomes a spectacle with a 4 paragraph Facebook post about the unbelievable things he saw whilst getting said coffee.

3:00 AM. This is the first thing I am typing on my new laptop, a gift from my parents back in my school days. I had only ever set it up for myself but never truly opened it—I knew I’d need it for university. Now, my fingers can barely find the keys. Clammy sweat drips from my forehead; I can hardly sit still. The room is pitch black, save for the faint glimmers of moonlight filtering in, offering me just enough light to see. There is a tight knot in my stomach—that specific kind of dread you feel when you aren't scared enough to faint, but enough to feel, for five agonizing seconds, as if your internal organs are falling out of your body, followed by a suffocating lump in your throat...

I have watched him for far too long. I knew he was a maniac—my neighbor.

As you’ve guessed, I am a student. It doesn’t matter what my major is; what matters is that I moved into a new build. A studio apartment—spacious enough, with a sleek renovation. I come from an ordinary family: my father is a math teacher, my mother a child psychologist. They saved up for this place because the university was a three-hour drive from home; by the way, I got into the state-funded program on my own merit. It was a compact, rationally planned space where the kitchen flowed into the living area, which in turn bled into the bedroom. It didn’t crush me, but it didn’t embrace me either; it was utterly functional and detached. A single window, wide and rectangular like a pupil, stared not at the noisy city artery, but into the inner courtyard. It was a typical ""well-courtyard,"" framed by identical mirrored walls of other blocks. The sun only visited for a couple of hours a day, casting fleeting shadows that stretched and distorted shapes. I didn't complain, but there was one thing that always unsettled me. Directly opposite, barely twenty meters away, yawned the neighbor's window. It wasn't just visible—it was too visible. No curtains, no clutter. It was an exact reflection of my own window, just a few floors down. This is the reason why, pressed against the back of my chair, I am writing this to you. Just listen, I beg you. I don’t have much time left...

 August 30, 2024

That was the day I spent my first night in the apartment. Nothing strange happened. I woke up, drank a glass of water, did a bit of exercise, showered—my usual routine. It was noon, and I was already running slightly late for my first part-time job. I wanted to experience the true student life—the kind where you study hard but also pay your own way for pocket money and utilities. Asking parents for money felt wrong. I’ve always lived by my principles—do it all yourself.

It was raining that day, just a light drizzle, and the sun was shining brightly. I was wearing casual clothes: a white t-shirt, black pants, and a hoodie—I didn't feel like carrying an umbrella. ""My Moon My Man"" played softly in my headphones. I loved that kind of music—tender and melancholic. I always preferred songs written and performed by women. As I walked, I didn't even notice my feet leading me to the coffee shop.

The interior reminded me of an old jewelry box collected over many years. There was none of that frightening symmetry found in new buildings: mismatched wooden tables with worn edges, deep armchairs upholstered in ripe-cherry velvet, and walls almost entirely hidden behind bookshelves. A soft amber light from low-hanging Edison lamps fractured in the windows, where a light fog of condensation had formed due to the temperature difference, cutting the world of the café off from the gray city outside. The rhythmic hiss of the espresso machine and the dull thud of the portafilter against the knock box created a strange, almost hypnotic white noise.

In the corner, someone quietly flipped the pages of a newspaper, and behind the counter was the barista—a petite girl in a flour-stained apron, humming to herself as she drew patterns in milk foam. She, by the way, was the one who taught me how to brew different kinds of coffee. I smiled automatically; I felt comfortable here. I knew the day would go smoothly.

""Oh, Jack, you're finally here!"" she walked toward me, fixing a messy bun. Dimples appeared in the corners of her cheeks, and her hair shone brighter than the sun—ginger. This girl evoked a tender feeling in me, as if she were my lost younger sister. I wanted to protect her.

""Hey, Ginger,"" I said, playfully pinching her left cheek.

""Oh, stop it... there are barely any people today, maybe because of the rain...""

She pouted, her brows furrowing slightly, and went back behind the counter, leaning on her elbows. I followed her. I thought to myself: Can rain really scare people away?

""Listen, Jack, I'm going home early today."" 

Rose lowered her head, her cheeks flushing pink.

""Mmm, does our Ginger have a date?"" I smirked, putting her on the spot.

""What... how did you know?"" she scratched the back of her head, turning away.

""Doesn't matter. Just make sure you're okay. Is this guy dangerous?""

""He's good... we’ve known each other since school. We were friends, but I'm hoping for something more,"" she wiggled her eyebrows and pursed her lips. I smiled again and, mimicking her loud voice, teased: ""Something more than a friend, ooooh!""

By the end of the shift, my body ached as if I had unloaded a truck of coffee beans single-handedly. My legs felt like lead, and a dull, throbbing pain settled in my lower back—the price of ten hours on my feet. It was a specific, clammy fatigue—not from the work itself, but from the waiting. When you are constantly ""on guard,"" ready to offer a rehearsed smile and a perfect espresso, but there is no one to give them to.

""I’m done, Jack! See you tomorrow!"" Rose jingled her keys cheerfully, slinging her bag over her shoulder. She left two hours early. Out there, beyond the café doors, she had a life: a date, a bright evening, the glow of which shone in her eyes. She practically floated out onto the street, leaving behind a faint trail of floral perfume and a ringing silence.

And I remained.

Closing the café alone is a ritual. I started with the espresso machine: habitual, automated movements. The metallic clang of the portafilter, the hiss of steam, the scent of cleaning chemicals. At one point, the silence in the hall felt too dense, almost tangible. I turned off the main lights, and the room plunged into deep twilight. Only the bluish glow of the display case and a dim streetlight from outside pierced the darkness. I wiped down the tables, my movements feeling foreign and slowed. After counting the till, I took one last look at the room. The chairs, turned upside down on the tables, looked like sentries frozen on guard. I flipped the final switch, locked the door, and for a moment, pressed my forehead against the cold glass.

Within two minutes, the fabric of my hoodie gave up. First, I felt a treacherous chill on my shoulders, and then thin trickles of water ran down my spine, making me shiver. The rain had intensified into a solid wall of ice. Streetlights blurred into yellow smears, and oncoming cars turned into blinding monsters, splashing me with filthy puddles. I walked fast, almost running, but it was futile. I was drenched to the bone. My jeans grew heavy and coarse, clinging to my legs and hindering my movement. My sneakers sloshed with every step. Water flooded my eyes, ran down my face, and entered my mouth with the metallic tang of the city. Every gust of wind pierced right through me. I felt utterly naked and defenseless under this elemental assault. The exhaustion felt unbearable, pulling me toward the ground as if the water-soaked clothes had added an extra ten kilograms of weight.

Ahead, through the veil of downpour, loomed the dark mass of my building. A vast, soulless monolith of glass and concrete. Most windows were e dark—the building was half-empty, dead. I dashed into my lobby and hit the elevator button, terrified I’d get stuck since it was brand new and I was drenching it from head to toe. Nothing happened.

Once inside the apartment, I kicked off my shoes and went straight to the bathroom. I peeled off the clammy clothes and stood under a warm shower. Thank God I had the sense to lay out dry, ironed pajamas beforehand. I poured myself a strong green tea and put my feet on the radiator. I lazily scrolled through YouTube as my feet nearly burned from the heat—that prompted me to get up and make dinner. I grabbed some chicken and started chopping it while listening to an ""Upvote"" podcast. Dinner was pasta in a creamy sauce. I smiled slightly at the stupid stories from the ""Today I Screwed Up"" section. After about 30 minutes, my stomach grumbled traitorously. I sat at the table that looks directly at the windows opposite—after closing the curtains—and began to devour my meal.

""God, I'm stuffed,"" my voice echoed through the apartment.

Goosebumps raced down my spine. I washed the dishes and lay down. My eyes wouldn't close. After tossing and turning for an hour, I finally got up and sat on the windowsill. I put on my favorite song and just stared into the courtyard. Empty. No one—not even drunks or smokers, let alone teenagers. My gaze fell on the window directly across from mine. Empty. Still. For two more minutes, the music played. I just wanted to sleep, but I couldn't. Before, when I lived with my parents, the feeling of them being just down the hall gave me peace. As soon as I’d lie down, I’d be out. I thought about everything: my family, school, friends who had scattered across different countries. Some didn't care about me anymore—they had girlfriends, studies, parties... ""youthful life."" I felt too alone in this empty, yet own, apartment.

I leaned my head against the cold glass, and then, in my peripheral vision, I saw a figure in the window opposite. It was a mirror image of my own. I knew I wasn't very visible with the lights off, so I turned my head and stared... In that apartment, a dim light was on. A figure in black—no facial features visible—was pressed against the window with their whole body, as if they had been sealed there from behind. He was tall, nearly my height, and he was staring directly at me. I squinted to see him better, but I couldn't see a face—it was like a black mannequin from a clothing store. But then, he shifted. He moved back from the window and... he waved at me. I’m not lying... he waved. It was meant for me... although, there were many other windows, right?

I swallowed hard. What the hell was happening? He left the room, but before he did, I caught a glimpse of his face... I can't remember it in detail, but I know for sure: he was well into his thirties. His lips began to stretch slowly, almost painfully, into a smile, baring his teeth, but no other muscle on his face moved. It was a mechanical, hollow smile, as if painted on a slab of cold marble. His eyes remained dead—unmoving dark voids, void of warmth. In the contrast between that exultant mouth and the icy gaze, there was something deeply wrong, triggering an instinctive, primal terror. As if the face was merely a screen hiding something only mimicking human joy.

He wasn't looking at the other neighbors... he was looking at me. It was terrifying, even for a man like me. I had never been afraid of horror movies, not even as a kid. I never feared the threats from school bullies. I was never the timid type. But right now, my heart was thumping in my ears, and my legs shook like a schoolgirl’s. I slid down quietly, afraid to break the silence, lay on the bed, and fell asleep in an instant. I didn't dream. I woke up and didn't go near the window again. I haven't gone near it for two weeks.

 September 20, 2024

The semester began with new acquaintances. Light topics. I invited my new friends to the café many times and introduced them to Rose. She has a boyfriend now. She introduced him to me about three days ago. A decent guy

—you can tell he’s harmless, and that lovesick look gives him away. Everything was flowing steadily. Sometimes my new friends came by to help when the café was swamped with customers—after all, writers seek inspiration there, and students come to take photos of the ""cozy spot."" Sometimes I visit my parents just to chat. I am surrounded by people all day. I don’t feel lonely anymore.

The only thing that almost always bothered me was sleeping with the curtains open. I knew he was watching me when I lay down, when I cooked, when I exercised. I felt him. Sometimes I’d look from the hallway at that bleak window and imagine his silhouette... Today I came home from university earlier than usual—during the day. I didn't have a shift. I wanted to go to my parents', but they had gone to see my grandparents. Going there would mean being late for tomorrow's session. So I was home alone again. It didn't bother me—it was daytime, after all, even if a bit overcast.

I sat on the ottoman in the hallway, looked around the apartment, took a deep breath of relief, and stood up slowly. I headed to the kitchen and noticed something that planted a seed of primal fear in me...

""The knife is gone... it's not here.""

My only knife, the one I used for everything, had vanished. I always kept it on the magnetic strip; I never put it in the drawers. I scrambled through the whole place: maybe it was on the bed? Had I hidden it there in case the psycho neighbor broke in? Yes, I know, it sounded unrealistic. Но that man had become the source of my anxiety. Time slowed down. I checked every corner of my tiny apartment: the closet, the drawers, the bathroom, my pockets, my bags, I even opened the fridge.

""It's gone...""

I left. I decided to go to Rose at the café. I was being consumed by this atmosphere of dread; I needed to talk to someone. I walked out of the courtyard without looking back, my spine shivering, my stomach churning. I thought about turning back—Rose is like a sister to me, I shouldn't show her my weakness. Besides, she probably wasn't even on shift. My thoughts were eating me alive, so I went back. I took the elevator up, and as soon as the doors opened, I smelled the pungent scent of cigars. It filled the whole landing. The jingle of keys, a sniffle, and a piercing, low laugh—someone was talking on the phone:

""Yeah, the guy's apartment is wide open. I don't know, I think I'll wait. No, don't come today, I have plans for the neighbor.""

I was breathing too fast and walking too slowly toward my door. Standing next to it was a guy taller and broader than me. He was dressed in all black, his face obscured by a cap. He seemed to stop talking when he heard my steps. He turned, and I saw his piercing blue eyes—they didn't look malicious. He smiled when he saw me.

""Neighbor?"" he tilted his head and walked toward me. Leaning right into my face, he smiled and held out a ring of keys... my keys.

I froze and snatched them. I was about to dash into the apartment when he grabbed my wrist and squeezed hard.

""You're not very welcoming for a neighbor. I thought you might at least offer me some tea.""

I looked at him and shook my hand free.

""Fine. Come in.""

It was stupid—inviting a stranger in while I wasn't even sure if my stalker was waiting inside. I was sure it was him who stole my knife. But you know... I hadn't even considered the version where this blue-eyed guy was the killer. I was so exhausted it didn't even matter. He walked in and took off his shoes.

""You've got a cozy place, man,"" he leaned against the doorframe and winked at me.

I also took off my shoes and started making tea.

""Black or green?""

I caught a glimpse of him. He was already sitting at the table, burning me with his gaze.

""Black.""

I handed him the mug. He blew on it and drank it all at once.

""What's your name? What did you mean by 'plans'? Where do you live?""

He snorted and laughed out loud.

""Easy, man. I'm Ray, I'm 23. I live in 320, right next to your place. I've been here for three years. I knew someone had moved into this apartment; it was empty the whole time I’ve

 lived here. Didn't think we'd meet like this. I'm in my sixth year, a future psychiatrist!"" he smiled to himself and continued: ""By the way, you left in such a hurry you didn't even notice me... I actually felt a bit sad. And yeah, you dropped your keys, left the door wide open. That’s dangerous, man. I know it’s a new building, but there are always unstable residents.""

""Sorry,"" I lowered my head, staring into my mug, my brain analyzing everything he said.

""What's your name? Where do you study?"" he asked expectantly.

""Jack. I'm 19. The architecture uni is nearby, first year. I work at the café. Sorry, just..."" I rubbed my forehead. ""There's something bothering me deeply, that's why I didn't notice you...""

""No kidding. Your eyes are bloodshot like you're not sleeping, and your hands are shaking. If you want, you can tell me everything.""

""Can we not do it here?""

""Huh?"" Ray looked puzzled.

""I'm scared here... let's just go for a walk. Besides, you said you had plans for me.""

""You're right about that.""

 September 21, 2024

I told Ray everything that day at the café, and Rose found out too. She is so worried about me. I am no longer her anchor. Ray, surprisingly, just listened and invited me to stay at his place for a few days until I felt better. Ray became a sort of friend to me. Every night I had nightmares: the dark figure in the window disappears, I exhale and fall back into a peaceful sleep, but then he knocks on my door. Every time I look through the peephole, and there he is—with my kitchen knife and a grin from ear to ear...

Today, Ray and I are going to watch this psycho. Today, in my apartment... I will prove my suspicions are right. It doesn't mean I doubt myself, and it doesn't mean I want Ray to suffer from a maniac neighbor... I know my actions are selfish. Ray is a psychiatrist; his psyche is tougher than mine. We entered my miserable studio.

""You only suspected he was a maniac? If he's watching, maybe he's just mentally ill,"" Ray shrugged, trying to calm me down.

""There's something I didn't tell you..."" 

I sat on my sofa. I didn't feel I had the right to hide the secret anymore.

""It happened on September 10 at 1:45 AM. I have no proof but my own eyes. It was pouring rain. Because of the fogged windows, I couldn't see clearly. I was watching because I thought he was a figment of my imagination; I needed to be sure. I stood by the window, curtains slightly parted so I couldn't be seen, and waited with my camera ready. This time, there was a woman. I was so relieved... I thought she had moved in and the neighbor was gone. She... collapsed. She died... do you understand? First, she was looking for something, tossing things around the room. I thought I could stop watching, but then he entered... She didn't seem to notice him; she was facing away, rummaging through a drawer. My heart stopped. Something stabbed at my chest, the phone fell from my hands, echoing loudly through the apartment, and that echo made her turn... He struck her. One small strike with a crowbar to the head... she fell as if lifeless. No words, no scream. Death took her instantly. When she fell, blood splattered the wall and the window... I knew it was blood. He picked her up and opened his window... God, he just opened the window, not caring about the consequences, or maybe he wanted to show me what would happen to me next. I just stared... The neighbor waved again, even without seeing me, crowbar in hand and the girl slung over his shoulder. He was smiling, never looking away... My curtains were closed... how could he see me? He killed her... Ray, he just killed her... Just believe me... he's a maniac. And soon I’ll be dead too.""

Ray looked at me in mute horror, his pupils dilating. He kept licking his dry lips. His gaze conveyed understanding. He didn't leave.

""Okay, wait, man... You aren't going to die, you hear me? We’re two big guys, you think we can't take him? Besides, you're living at my place now, he won't know. Tell me... do you remember what the woman looked like? We need to tell the police.""

""I don't remember... I couldn’t really see. I wanted to go to the police, but I have no evidence. What cop takes a case without proof? It’ll just collect dust on a shelf.""

""Then..."" he patted my back and stood up abruptly. ""Turn on the camera. I'll film. We'll take him down with this.""

2:00 AM

I was drifting off in the chair while Ray stood for an hour, watching for the maniac. No one appeared. Мои надежды рушились, but there was a silver lining. If he was a figment of my imagination, I’d go to a clinic, recover, and come out—mentally unstable, sure, but better than him being real...

""Oh my god... JESUS, JACK!"" 

Ray yelled so loud I nearly fell off the chair. You won't believe it... The neighbor entered the room. He leaned down slowly, as if he had dropped a knife.

""What is he trying to pick up...?""

""Now do you believe me?""

""I always believed you, man... get the phone ready, we're calling 911.""

""Yeah, right...""

I took Ray’s phone; mine was recording. As I dialed 911:

""No... no, no, no... look...""

I looked. The neighbor didn't pick up a knife... he picked up a guy by the scruff of his neck. The guy was clearly unconscious. Again, no face, but we saw him raise a sharp knife over him, tilting his head and looking directly at our window...

""Jack, dial! QUICK, OH MY GOD!"" Ray was screaming hysterically.

The neighbor plunged the knife into his victim's neck... My fingers shook, but I made the call.

""911, what is your emergency?"" The woman's voice was calm.

""Barkery Street, 4V. The neighbor across the window... he stabbed a guy... he killed him, please... help...""

3:00 AM the same night

The police found the bodies of a man and a woman. The neighbor really was a maniac; he kept them in his closet. They locked him up. It doesn't matter for how long; I didn't follow the case. I moved. He won't be in my life anymore.

 October 1

Ray went to stay with his girlfriend for a few months but kept in touch. We saw each other periodically, but it wasn't the same. Neither of us wanted to bring up that night. We learned more about each other, occasionally went to a pub with common friends, Rose, and her boyfriend. Speaking of Rose: when she found out what I’d been through, she visited me almost every day, bringing pastries. We watched movies, cooked together. My parents lived with me for a while; with them, I wasn't afraid. Life was getting back on track. Slowly, I felt the anxiety disappearing. I am starting a new chapter.

 September 21, 3:00 AM

I have watched him for far too long. I knew he was a maniac—my neighbor.

I don’t understand why he is the way he is, why he chose me as his audience. Why he wouldn't let me live my life as a normal student. What did I do wrong? I had never seen him before. We weren't schoolmates. I thought about it a lot: what if he was bullied and I just watched? But that’s impossible because I always protected the weak. I was weak myself, but I had courage to spare. That leaves only one option... I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I am alone again... oh, and one more thing:

I can smell a decomposing body in my closet... two bodies. I try not to breathe, and I struggle to suppress the smile on my face.",1,1769276760.0,u_sawarasenai11111,0,0.99,False

Socialists love to complain about life for average people under capitalism, especially in the US where they like to act like life is a living hell. This makes me wonder, have they ever *tried* to succeed in their life? 

My friend grew up in a midwestern suburb. He wasted his 20s playing video games. He delivered pizza for years, dropped out of college, and partied like crazy. Eventually he got a manager position at a fast food restaurant. Not exactly a high-profile position, but it paid a bit better than pizza delivery. After a couple years, he switched jobs and got a raise. He’s now the general manager at a coffee chain making $95,000. 

He got married a few years ago and had a baby. His wife is a nurse, making just over $100,000. Together they make almost $200,000 a year in a low cost Midwestern city. They live in a house that looks like [this](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/7345-Runningbrook-Way_Indianapolis_IN_46254_M48155-15650?from=srp-list-card). We spent 8 days at an all-inclusive resort last week. He’s considering an in-ground pool next year (or maybe just a hot tub depending on his bonus…). He said he’s next in line for regional manager, a position that starts at $120,000. 

In a sense, the socialists are right. Life is hard. Capitalism means you have to *work* and that’s not fair! But maybe the real hell is being a pathetic socialist slacker who spends all day on silly Marxist forums engaging in abstract nonsense instead of contributing to your community. A self-induced hell, but hell nonetheless.

Alfama is the oldest part of Lisbon and one of the few areas that survived the great earthquake of 1755 almost intact. Its maze of narrow streets, small alleys, and colourful houses still keeps the atmosphere of old Lisbon.

The name Alfama comes from the Arabic word al-ḥamma, meaning “hot springs.” During the Moorish occupation, this was the heart of the city, a neighbourhood shaped by Islamic influence and centuries of history. After the Christian reconquest became home to fishermen and working families, keeping a strong sense of community that remains today.

Alfama became one of the best places in Lisbon to experience live Fado.

Things I recommend in Alfama

It’s impossible to share all my recommendations in Alfama, but here are 5 special places I really like:

O Cartaxeiro (restaurant)

Alfama has fewer and fewer authentic restaurants, but this one has survived.

It is only open for lunch and is one of my favourite places to eat real Portuguese food in Alfama.

O Sardinha (restaurant)

Another true tasca that is still alive in Lisbon.

Simple food, honest flavours, and very local.

Tejo Bar (bar)

Alfama is often linked to fado, but I recommend Tejo Bar.

It’s a tiny bar with live music from around the world and a very special atmosphere.

Dolce Alfama (pastry shop)

A traditional local pastry shop, perfect for a coffee and something sweet.

Ulisses (cocktail bar)

A bar with only 3 square metres.

It works only by reservation and offers a truly unique cocktail experience.

1qltaah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1qltaah/let_me_tell_you_about_luggage_storage/,Let me tell you about luggage storage,"Turns out that some people don't know about luggage storage. 

I sailed out of galveston a couple weeks ago. Unfortunately my return flight home was at 8p but I got off the ship at 8a (It was a last-minute booking so flights were limited).

12 hours? Yikes.

I also sailed out of Miami a couple years ago with similar timeline on return. 

You don't want to sit around the airport. 
For one reason, you can't check your bigger bags till 4 to 6 hours before your flight and I don't think you can take your big bags thru security (?) and then come back late to check them (I might be wrong about this).

And, often, there's not a lot of seating/cafes *before* the TSA checkpoint.

So you *might* be sitting on the sad, boring side of TSA with limited seating, no coffee, etc for *hours*.

But who wants to haul large luggage around a city to spend time before your flight? 

Both times I used an app called Bounce. These are vetted, insured places that will store your luggage for only a couple bucks per bag. 

My solution in Miami was to use Bounce to store my bags near a resort, then I bought a daybpass under $100 for the resort and laid around the pool (The resort didn't provide the luggage storage for day users). 

In Miami, it was a room behind the desk at a condo/airbnb. The front desk took my stuff and put it back there.

In Galveston, I went to a museum, and dropped my luggage at a storage facility 5 minutes from the museum. It turned out that the woman who lived at the facility just meet me and put my luggage inside her apartment. 

Some people on Reddit thought this whole thing is dicey. I've done it also in Barcelona when I arrived early in the morning but couldn't check into my Airbnb until 4:00 p.m. those were actual luggage locker places. I also did it in Milan when I had a late flight from there but had to be out of my hotel at 11:00 an hour away. 

I've never had any problems. They're like uber-- they have background checks and they are generally locked away and also they want to keep their rating up. 

Hope this helps someone! The app I use is called Bounce.

1qlt8co,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TrafficMasterB/comments/1qlt8co/small_textile_changes_that_instantly_brighten_a/,Small Textile Changes That Instantly Brighten a Room,"https://preview.redd.it/0yqjjib02cfg1.jpg?width=6411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97f2671da01374256ecf6db7b47f56fe339d641e

When a space feels drab or weighed down, the first impulse is to repaint, replace furniture, or add new décor. However, some of the most dramatic changes can be achieved through much more subtle means. Textiles, due to their large visual scale and direct interaction with light, have the ability to instantly brighten a space with little effort or expense.

Brightening up a room has nothing to do with making it louder or more trendy. It has everything to do with allowing light to flow more freely, reducing visual weight, and incorporating materials that have a lifting effect on the space. With a few strategic textile changes, even the most neutral space can be revitalized.

* **Start Where Light Enters the Room**

Windows are the first place to look when it comes to any brightening update. If a room is gloomy even during the daytime, it is likely that the heavy or outdated window treatments are the cause.

By putting up sheer curtains, the effect on light in the room is immediate. Sheer fabrics allow light to filter into the room in a gentle manner, as opposed to blocking the light. Sheer curtains will eliminate harsh glare in the room while still illuminating it.

Sheer curtains also provide a subtle movement, which brings life to the room, especially when the windows are open.

**Will sheer curtains work in rooms that need privacy?**

Yes, especially during the daytime. The sheer curtains reduce the visibility while still allowing the brightness to enter. They can also be used in combination with other curtains.

* **Lighten Seating with Thoughtful Cushioning Upgrades**

Sofas and armchairs consume a lot of visual space, which means that even a small change in this area can make a big difference. Over time, seating areas tend to collect darker or heavier cushions that contribute to the visual density of a room.

Adding some [decorative throw pillows](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/pillow) in lighter shades or textures can instantly give your space a facelift. It is also a good idea to select throw pillows that contrast slightly with your furniture instead of choosing ones that match your furniture.

Do not overcrowd. Two or three pillows will often provide more light than a crowded grouping.

* **Introduce Brightness Through Table Surfaces**

Tables, whether dining, coffee, or console, are key focal points in the room. If they are designed with dark or heavy fabrics, they can end up dragging the whole room down.

A [custom table runner](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/table-runner) made from a lighter material or a neutral color can instantly update these surfaces. A table runner provides definition and shape to the table without covering the entire surface area, which allows more of the surface to reflect light.

In spring and summer, lighter runners make the tables feel more relaxed and inviting, which is useful for both daily use and casual gatherings.

**Is a table runner more effective than a tablecloth for adding color to a room?**

Yes, often. The runners add visual interest to the table while maintaining the openness and lightness of the space, even in smaller or brighter rooms.

* **Trade Heavy Throws for Airier Comfort**

Throws are one of the simplest textiles to change with the seasons, but they are often left the same long after winter is over. Heavy and dark-colored throws can actually absorb light, making a seating area feel warmer and heavier than it actually is.

Replacing them with [eco-friendly blankets](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/blanket) made of breathable materials makes an instant change. These blankets fall in a more fluid way, allowing light to filter around seating areas rather than being trapped in thick fabric. They provide comfort but feel more in tune with the lighter months.

Either folded neatly or casually draped, the lighter blankets convey a sense of ease and freshness without appearing incomplete.

* **Use Texture to Reflect, Not Absorb Light**

To light up a room, it’s not only about the colors but also about how different textures respond to light. Textures that are flat, matte, or too thick have a tendency to absorb light, while those that are soft or slightly reflective have a tendency to bounce light around the room.

Seek out textiles with subtle weave variation, soft pile, or natural movement. These elements add visual interest that changes throughout the day, making a space feel dynamic rather than static. This works particularly well in neutral interiors, where light is generated by material quality rather than contrast. Soft neutrals, muted pastels, and warm earth tones can all help brighten a room if the fabric is breathable and light-sensitive. Concentrate on One Room at a Time One of the benefits of textile updates is that they do not require a whole-home refresh. By concentrating on a single room, such as the living room or dining room, you can immediately see the effects. Once you realize how light, texture, and air movement can enhance the space, you can then apply these concepts in other areas of your home. Sometimes, simply rotating fabrics from room to room is all you need to give your whole house a facelift. 

* **Brightness That Feels Effortless**

This is because rooms appear brighter not because they are overly decorated but because they are well-balanced. This is achieved by allowing light to freely enter a room and by using textiles that support rather than obstruct the light. With the addition of sheer curtains to soften the windows, updating furniture with throw pillows, revamping tables with a table runner, and replacing thick blankets with eco-friendly ones, you can transform your room completely in a matter of minutes. These minute changes not only light up the room but also change the way you experience the room. The room, which was stagnant and stale, now starts to work in sync with the season instead of against it.",1,1769276149.0,u_TrafficMasterB,0,1.0,False

The soft rolling and lapsing of blue waves, gentle on the shoreline, the birds running in and out with the tide, the heat of the sun toasting my cheeks, the sand in between my toes, and green wild grass blowing in the wind.

You remind me of fresh linen out of the dryer, still warm and clinging, beige and crisp, long winding roads surrounded by aspen trees with leaves changing from spring green to autumn fall oranges.

You remind me of ebony on bone… dominos perhaps, croquet sets from my childhood, caramel covered apples, lemonade stands, climbing trees, dried flowers, four leaf clovers, dandelion chain crowns, steam from a cup of tea or coffee, cozy things.

I wish, for a moment when I woke up, I could still hear your voice talking to me in that quiet, slow cadence, a rhythm I try to replicate but can only describe as enchanting, whiskey-flavored, honey-toned, intentional. When I touch your skin, it’s not static in a bad way; I can feel my pulse in my fingertips — slightly erotic and warm.

You speak like a lullaby putting me to sleep.

The owner works there. he provides lunch for us every single day. lunch might be a ham cheese toasted sandwich. there's always salad. the other day it was pasta, chicken, more salad. and the owner tells me and the other staff to eat another plate and eat as much as we want.

some staff had cancer and operations, and they were glad they were able to keep their jobs after coming back a few months later.

we also get paid while eating lunch. it's not an unpaid 30 min lunch like other places.

but the drawback is that our lunch isn't 30 minutes. our lunch is just eat until we don't want to eat any more, drink water or tea or coffee, rest, have a chat, go back to work when you're ready. I'm sure that is only about 20 minutes.

we also don't clock in or clock out, which means some staff members come late sometimes about 10 min.

please tell me other small independent pharmacies do this too

1qlss2o,https://i.redd.it/zjct2ydczbfg1.jpeg,Another recommendation for Skylark coffee,"Misfits!

Rejects!

Ah, remember the days before you were really deep into pour over? you would go to the local grocery store and buying a bag of coffee for £4 seemed worthwhile if it was that much better than instant and spared you regularly going to Starbucks/wherever else?

Well, I know that I have come a long way since then, but then again so has the amount of money I pay for coffee.

Recently I saw that skylark was offering their misfits rejects coffee for £4/250g and I bought it a few weeks back shortly after buying my  Kingrinder K7- Just to help balance out the average cost of some of the more expensive coffees I bought and to help season my new grinder.

To my surprise, this coffee out performs practically every commercially available coffee I’ve ever tried- most recently the micro lot for Marks & Spencer’s (6.75/227g)

To recap, misfits beans from Skylark are basically rejects- but in my experience honestly this offered a really interesting cup still with unusual notes worth exploring. I especially love how, because it’s an amalgam of all the different coffees they offer, you can’t overthink the method. I follow my basic recipe and voilà; a sweet chocolatey caramel semi- fruity cup of coffee for a palate that is exhausted with specialty nuance.

I especially love that Skylark is a registered charity, and I follow the logic that this helps reduce waste. A coffee like this will always make ordering from Skylark worth it because you can average out a cheaper cost to your monthly amount just by throwing one of these in the cart. And to be frank I really enjoy this when I am tired of evaluating and analyzing specialty cups.

Ah, the relief! not only for my taste buds, but my wallet too.

Basically, I highly recommend picking up a bag of this if you’re gonna order from Skylark because it’s super cheap and in my opinion is better than any coffee you could buy from the grocery store for the same price in an emergency.

So do yourself a favor if you’re trying out Skylark- pick up a bag of this alongside whatever else you’re getting and watch how your average cost per kilo of coffee drops significantly, and you can finally chill out about the brew method and enjoy some good old-fashioned high-quality coffee, coffee and more coffee.",2,1769275133.0,UKroasters,2,1.0,False

Most of my school/college friends are abroad so my social circle is very small at the moment! Would be great to chat with or meet some new people! 

I work in an office job Monday to Friday and I also have another side gig that occupies some evenings and weekends. Outside of that I spend my time -

\- In the gym - pretending I like cardio 

\- Walking my dog (who has no issue making new friends)

\- Listening to music or staying up too late watching some new series

\- Reading

\- Taking some road trips 

\- I do a little photography

\- Go to a couple of gigs 

\- I also game a little but it’s taken a back seat lately 

Happy to chat to guys or girls looking for some genuine friends to go for coffee, chat, go to gigs, pints(always a great suggestion) or a walk/hike etc. I am in a relationship so not looking for anything romantic, but if you’re also in a relationship, some couple friends would be cool too!

When we are looking at full packs, including consumables, under 10lbs, withheld poops could be as much as 5% of your entire carried weight.

When optimizing your food selections, you aren’t truly committed to considering the entirety of weight in your control unless you are selecting dinners/breakfasts that instigate a thorough and complete poop before you get going again in the morning.

If you’re an afternoon or evening pooper on the trail, you’ve carried all that extra weight for no reason. Let it out early.

Recommendations? Almonds, of course. Oatmeal for breakfast maybe. Or I justify a little instant coffee to get me going in the morning. Heck, stick a little miralax in one of those old alcohol fuel bottles you’re not using anymore. You can offset an entire meal’s worth of weight just by pooping in the morning!

But I bought the chai tea monin syrup. I used it in the coffee but it tasted cinnamonny to the max. Like undrinkable.

When I tasted the syrup on a spoon though, that cinnamon was not so overpowering and it was just sweet and delicious. We use a machine for the latte’s and I always use the least amount of coffee (because I don’t do well with too much caffeine yet still love coffee) and a lot of milk. So it shouldn’t tamper with the flavour right? It’s just coffee and milk idk.

When I used more of the syrup in the coffee, it tasted sweeter but the cinnamon became even more overpowering. My tongue was dying and it got it’s own little funeral.

Sometimes I get an intense craving even if it hasn't been long since I ate



I used to blame myself for it



I thought I lacked self control



But now I feel it's more related to my stress levels and the disruption of my daily routine



I've noticed that when I feel unstable in my life my mind tends to seek out familiar things  quick relief easy comfort



I'm not here to offer dietary rules or advice on quitting sugar



I'm just curious to see how others view sugar cravings as signals rather than signs of failure



Have you noticed that stress, lack of sleep, or skipping meals intensify sugar cravings?



And has sticking to a daily routine been more beneficial than following a healthy diet?

1qlsodo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1qlsodo/please_share_your_experience/,Please share your experience,"I’ve developed my first histamine flares summer 2022 after my (estimated) first Covid infection. I remember feeling really sick which I hadn’t felt before in a long time. Over time it got a lot worse. I remember times when i could still drink coffee or eat tomatoes and only suffer very mild symptoms (like flush) which would only display in the late evening. Three years later my hopes are completely shattered.

This is has been a very frustrating medical journey as most doctors have never even heard of MCAS before. I’m really fighting for a diagnosis while parallel I’m fighting through severe symptoms. Ive started reacting to rice and potatoes which everyone knows is histamine friendly and shouldn’t cause a reaction. My blood level results are normal, my tryptase is also normal. I need recommendations for the next tests which need to be conclusive for a diagnosis. What is your experience with testing for leukotrine and prostaglandin? 

These are my symptoms:

\-Flush 

\-brainfog

\-headache

\-chronic fatigue

\-digestive issues

I react to:

\-everything with histamine and more 

\-strong scents 

\-heat

\-cold (which paradoxically in return reduces the flush)

\-emotional stress 

\-high oestrogen during my cycle 

\-cardio sports

I’m on this medication:

Rupatadine (H1)

Famotidine (H2)

(Waiting for chromolyn sodium as I need an allergy diagnosis to receive the prescription) 

I feel like the combination has helped a little but not really. 

My diagnosis:

my gynaecologist found two endometriosis lesions in my uterine wall which indicates Adenomyosis otherwise nothing I’m diagnosed with ptsd and depression as well which I struggled with yes but I made great improvements and I’m still in therapy. I don’t wanna go down the “it’s psychosomatic” road. I don’t have the energy for that anymore. Being a young women with a psychological medical history and being chronically ill is the perfect combination for medical gaslight. Makes me want to become violent.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I know when I look at my medical journey I’m only at the beginning, still I think this is the most frustrated I’ve been in my entire life. I’ve suffered a lot of psychological trauma but I refuse to believe this to be the root cause. It feels as if my life is coming to an end at 19 and I have to fight trough this all alone. I’ve gathered a lot of knowledge and assume that Covid and in consequence left over spike proteins are the motor of my hyperactive mastcells. 

Is there anyway to heal this? For my understanding the only recovery route is to eliminate histamine triggers, calm the nervous system and a combination of h1,h2 antihistamines and mastcellstabilisators. I just feel extremely hopeless and alone. I just finished school last year and been in the worst flare ever since summer 2025. I just want my life back.

the absolute easiest thing i've found to completely avoid the traffic chaos and the circling hunt for a spot is using an app called Prked. it lets you rent someone's private driveway or garage space right next to lil' indies, which is honestly the absolute closest you can get. it’s usually way cheaper than the paid lots and you completely skip the congestion. you just pull right into your reserved spot and it’s a super short walk over to the venue. i seriously suggest pre-booking a spot before you even leave the house.  
  
if you don't go the Prked route, your main alternative is street parking, but it's a gamble. the good news is that the metered parking on the main roads like north mills avenue is generally free after 6:00 pm, which is perfect for a 7:00 pm show. the tricky part is finding an open space because those fill up incredibly fast. if you're trying for a free street spot, definitely get there a little early, maybe around 6:30 pm, just to beat the initial rush of the night crowd hitting the strip.  
  
a huge warning about parking in the neighborhoods and side streets off mills - you absolutely must read the signs super carefully. a lot of those spots are resident permit only, and honestly, they are not shy about towing in that area, so do not risk it. also, make sure you aren't blocking any part of the sidewalk or within five feet of a driveway. be prepared to walk a few blocks if you go this route.  
  
for a more guaranteed spot if you're willing to pay the rates, there are a few paid lots around. there is a lot managed by pmc at \*\*736 n mills ave\*\* where you can pay easily from your phone. there’s also another paid service lot over near \*\*631 n thornton ave\*\*. you could also try the large lot shared by lazy moon pizza and lineage coffee, but heads up: as of january 26th, that lot officially transitioned to paid parking. lineage customers can validate up to two hours free, but you absolutely have to check for any tow warnings or signs restricting parking for other businesses before you leave your car there. and don't even bank on the very small lot right at will's pub (where lil' indies is located) unless you get there when the bar opens at 4:00 pm.  
  
hope this helps someone out and you have an awesome time at the show.",1,1769274762.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Help this girlie, please?🥺","I’ve finally decided to join the Stanley club but I’m having the hardest time choosing which variant to buy. Help this girlie please decide which one is worth it and should she buy. For those who have using these mug/flasks, I’d love to know your thoughts and experience how’s the product, etc.

About me (To help me choose siguro which variant mag fifit sa akin):

• I’m an office girlie who really loves to drink water (better for mind and whole body hehehe) that’s why tumbler or a flask is a must every time I go outside. 

• I’m an eco-conscious and plastic-free advocate so buying a bottled water is a no-no for me. 

• I'm a heavy packer. Currently using BASH Manila weekday tote and I love it kasi super na-aaccomodate nya yung mga gamit that I need to bring. Inside my bag includes:

\- Lenovo Thinkpad (Ito talaga isa sa nag papa-bigat ng bag ko I sweaaaaar. May laptop bag naman but bukod sa ayoko na ng another bibitin, makaka-limutin ako so baka malimutan ko sya when I place it somewhere. There are times na kahit nasa vision ko na yung item nakaka-limutan ko pa din bitbitin huhuhuhuhu)

\- Medium coin purse with all of my cards and IDs except passport

\- Mobile phones (Personal and company issued)

\- Charger for laptop and mobile phones

\- Earpods

\- Magnetic powerbank

\- Handheld fan

\- Makeup kit

\- Hygiene and sanitary kit (Toothbrush, toothpaste, alcohol, wipes, tissue, hand lotion, liquid hand soap, liner and pad)

\- Perfume

\- Umbrella (Regardless kung ano weather, I always bring my umbrella)

\- Vitamins and ointment

\- Book, journal, and a pen

\- Eco bag (Just in case I need to bring something na hindi fit sa bag ko)

\- Extra clothes (Undergarments, shirt, and shorts). Just in case na ma-trap somewhere at least may pamalit na damit hahahaha lol

\- Snacks (Candies, cracker, and energy bar). May pang backup just in case magutom sa byahe or kung nasaan man or kapag na trap din somewhere at least may food pang survival hahahahaha.

• Since hybrid ang work setup ko, I love to work sometimes sa mga coffee shop and yes, tumbler/flask pa din when I order drinks outside unless they’ll provide a mug but tumbler/flask is a great choice pag lagyan ng drink for me kasi it can make the hot beverage lasts longer. I prefer hot drinks kasi over the iced one hehehehe. Plus na-leless yung babayaran mo kasi nag didiscount yung some of the coffee shop if you have tumbler.



Initial assessment so far:

1. Aerolight Transit Fliptop Mug – First and top choice

\- Php 1,950 for 16oz. Mej pricey compare sa other choice.

\- I feel like hard to clean especially yung lid

\- Great for both cold and hot drinks

\- Lightest among the 3 options. But ang worry ko is dahil sobrang gaan nya, baka prone syang dumulas and mahulog kapag hinuhugasan or even kapag wala na syang laman.

\- Very handy. Not too bulky since manipis, medyo makapal lang sya ng kaunti sa umbrella. Very car and bag friendly talaga sya.

\- Plain and estetik hahahaha

\- Baka not okay na yung lid kapag sobrang gamit na and baka madali na syang ma-open that can cause na mag leleak yung laman.



2. Café to Go Insulated Travel Mug – Second option

\- Php 1,800 for 16oz

\- Easy to clean kasi parang baso lang

\- Great for both cold and hot drinks. Also, two-part lid din sya, pwedeng sip or yung top lid kapag mag ddrink.

\- May weight na sya compare sa 2 aerolight. And I feel like mej bulky sya.

\- Since trip ko sometimes to work sa mga coffee shop, yung aesthetic nitong variant na’to is very café and coffee friendly.



3. Aerolight IceFlow Bottle Cap & Carry + Lid – Additional product pangpa hirap mag decide lol

\- Php 1,800 for 16oz

\- Mainly great for cold drinks but hot beverage can also last long

\- Handy since merong handle

\- Mej bulky na sya inside the bag

\- Lightweight next to transit fliptop mug

\- Leakproof and easy to clean din



Help me also to choose a color. I’m eyeing black or cream gloss lang naman hehehehe. Thank you in advance guys!

If you like espresso that punches back, cafecito is the move. It’s classic in Cuban communities and super common in Florida — strong coffee topped with that signature sweet foam (“espuma”). Small cup, big energy.

You’ll need

	•	42 g coffee (brew it strong)

	•	3 tsp brown sugar (or to taste)

	•	Water (as needed for your brew method)

How to make it

	1.	Brew very strong coffee (moka pot is ideal, but any method works—just go strong).

	2.	In a cup, add brown sugar and a small splash of the first brewed coffee (just enough to wet the sugar).

	3.	Whip it hard with a spoon for 30–60 seconds until it turns into a light, creamy paste/foam (espuma).

	4.	Pour the rest of your strong coffee over the espuma and stir gently.

	5.	Serve in small espresso cups and share—this one’s made for hanging out.

Remix ideas

	•	Use white sugar for a more classic vibe

	•	Add a tiny pinch of cinnamon on top

	•	Want it iced? Pour over ice and top with a little milk (not traditional, but good)

1qlsevm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qlsevm/rf_something_green_by_august_m_fischer/,[RF] “Something Green” by August M. Fischer,"**PART 1: HER**

My wife and I share the long and sometimes defeating effort of laying the kids down for bed at the end of the night. If all goes as planned, she and I can steal away and enjoy an hour of uninterrupted time together. Unfortunately, that isn't always the case if one or both of us succumbs to the comfort of a warm bed.

I wonder if she feels the same as I do when we're completely alone. I mean, I wonder if there's ever a flicker of shyness or nervousness that passes through her—the kind that comes on a first or second date. She probably doesn't feel that way; it's always been me who's more in tune with the emotional side of things. I'll admit, months and years of operating more like co-workers around our children have left me clinging to small, momentary feelings like this whenever I get her all to myself. I grow increasingly excited about the idea of her—almost like falling in love again.

They say you fall in love three times in your life, and I think I'm in the middle of the second. She starts to talk about her day, about opinionated things involving her workplace. I try to be a good listener, but her words fade as I lose myself in those beautiful brown eyes. The same eyes our children have. She doesn't notice, but I nod to show I'm listening, even as my gaze drifts to her lips. Perfect and beautiful. Lips I'd love nothing more than to kiss as she babbles on, but I resist the urge and let her continue. Then I notice a long strand of hair begging to be brushed behind her ear—any excuse to touch her soft cheek. And I wonder if she ever looks at me the same way. I don't think she does.

""Why?"" someone might ask. ""Why are you so moved by someone who doesn't share the sentiment?""

I have to think about those questions once in a while. The truth is, I'm still as in love with her as the moment I slipped a ring on her finger. And I have to believe she's genuine when she says, ""I love you."" But I'd be lying if I said I never wondered whether I'm naïve in my love. I've come to realize I'm a people pleaser—a trait I inherited from my mother. When I care about someone, I have no problem showering them with acts of service and gifts. Physical touch, of course, ranks high on that list. And because of this, I could never expect someone to meet these traits with their own.

As I've grown to understand the ever-changing person my wife has become, I've learned that her love language is quiet—subtle, if it's there at all. I remind myself that looking at her family offers a glimpse into who she is. They yell. They bicker. They don't leave much room for moral questioning. They're straightforward, sometimes apathetic, and they have little patience for emotional dissections. That doesn't make them bad people. It doesn't make her a bad person either—just someone who'll make you work for the pathway to her heart.

And maybe that's why I don't always feel the same kind of love reflected back. Because, without interference, those traits were never encoded in her DNA. Still, I hold on to this idea of a woman who might one day miraculously emerge from her own skin. Someone who would see me in the same light I see her, and we'd grow old together, cherishing every moment of our love.

But then, like a baby monitor crackling to life, I'm reminded that this is the real world—and our attention is needed elsewhere.

SCREAMING. CRYING. CLAWING. BITING. HITTING. FALLING. CRYING. CRYING. CRYING.

Sometimes you wonder how children produce so many tears without passing out. Some nights begin to blur together. I used to say, ""Mothers don't have the hardest job in the world. Go work on an oil rig and tell me that's not harder."" Most men probably share that opinion but I'd bet they weren't splitting the load fifty-fifty. Or sometimes, a hundred to zero.

When you watch your wife carry, birth, and care for a new life, you begin to see what's behind the curtain. That curtain was hung long ago and painted with soft pastels that said something like, ""You're about to embark on the most beautiful journey! You'll witness the miracle of becoming a mother and cherish every moment."" I don't mean this cruelly, but it almost feels like a sick joke.

Moaning. Grunting. Screaming. Whispering. Crying. Crying. Crying.

A mother's body is like the earth after a storm—split, reshaped, torn. What was once untouched now carries the memory of creation. When the tides recede, the shore is never quite the same. But when you walk it again, the sun rises over the horizon, and there's beauty there. I don't want to tell you a mother's story for her. I can only better understand my own story through hers.

On one of those quiet, uninterrupted nights, I scheduled a talk with her. This wasn't one of our usual hour-long conversations, half spent sharing videos on our phones. Instead, it unfolded into a three-hour discussion. I sat across the room, giving us space to bridge the distance between us as we worked toward a shared understanding. It began softly, with tears. Then it deepened—sobbing, questioning, searching. And it ended with us side by side, making new promises.

That night brought many things into focus and answered questions. First, she ruled out the idea that anything lacking between us was my fault. Second, she admitted that she feels like there isn't a sexual bone in her body, even though she's still attracted to me. We assume it's hormonal after the children. Third, she confessed that she hasn't felt like herself in a long time. She catches glimpses of who she was, but never fully. Her inability—or unwillingness—to examine those feelings has left her struggling to describe them at all.

I remind myself of where she comes from. The language of her family. And words, even at their best, are a limited form of communication. I hold that in mind as I try to understand her.

She's been broken. She's lost her youthfulness. She's lost her body. She's lost the time and space to remember who she is. My heart aches for her—but it also races to fix her. I have to stop myself, remind myself that not everything can be fixed. Maybe the best help I can offer isn't showing her the way forward, but walking by her side through it. She's always been my best friend. An incredible mother and strong wife. The only person I ever wanted to walk through this life with.

Everything I'm journalling here is elevated stylistically. This is not to assume things are untrue or aren't as meaningful, because they are. I find myself writing in ways no real person would ever talk, but more so in the language of an author. Or maybe my mind. Instead of pouring my heart out to a professional psychologist, I find so much emotional healing from just putting the pen to paper.

Someone might think, ""What a bitch. This dude has to write his feelings to get over it!"" Actually that's more like my subconscious speaking. It's true that I'm an emotional person, but more so, I'm an artist first. The world that I see is through a lens that makes sense to me. This makes sense when reality is complicated and messy. This is structured, thought out. There's no walking away and regretting to say something more, it's already here, at my own pace.

Now I could have written a novel when it comes to what it means to be a father. What my children mean to me, but I think I have a clear focus for this writing. Fatherhood is for another time and conscious. It deserves that.

I'm eager to get home most days. Not to relax, but to see them. To see her. If I'm being completely honest with myself, there are points in my life where my day to day emotions were totally reliant on my wife. This is probably very normal, on both sides. In a way, I viewed this as a type of co-dependency that was disguised as supportiveness. I want to help you! Make you happy. Convince myself that I feel seen. Because if I don't, then my emotional compass will forever spin. She is my direction.

No. This is not healthy. I have been re-wiring my mind and unearthing up answers I'd previously thought were held by someone else. They were always with me. I just wasn't listening. There are very loud voices, but in the back, way in the back behind layers, there are soft ones. I'd encourage anyone to practice finding them.

The root of a tree is not always seen, but it's vital for keeping this tree alive. Its branches stretch and leaves blossom in every direction. How beautiful this tree has become. But what of the root? He's hidden deep below, calculating his reach, twisting his foundation and growing stronger. Nobody sees the root, but they're not supposed to. The leaves are beautiful.

I don't need your kind words. I don't need your affirmation. I just need to see it in your eyes, once in a while. Something that says, ""I'm with you. I love you.""

She has weathered the storms on the surface and I've felt them below.

**PART 2: ME**

We step back into the bedroom. A whirlwind of crying hits us. We take our stations beside each baby, stroking soft hair, whispering reminders that we're still here. The noise fades. The room exhales. Only the hum of the oscillating fan remains. Through the blackness, a faint reflection glimmers in her eyes—they're still open. I smile, reach out, find her hand.

But she isn't looking at me. Her gaze drifts somewhere behind me, somewhere far away. If only I could hear her thoughts. If only she would share them.

Then that voice—the one I thought I'd buried—crawls out of the ashes.

What if she's fantasizing about someone else? Shut up.

What if she longs for a real man? One who excites her with adventure instead of tormenting her with your twisted perceptions. SHUT UP.

And then comes that feeling—like stepping from sunlight into a cold, dark space. I dread it because I know it too well. I've lived here before. My hand finds hers again. I rub her lifeless fingers—no response. Her eyes still wander, anywhere but mine. I sink a little further.

The alarm tears through my dreams. 3:41 A.M. Like clockwork, I'm gathering my things in the dark. The world sleeps while I begin my day. The road glows ahead in my headlights. For a moment, it feels quiet enough to forget. Almost.

Today is a new day. I can be anyone when I walk back through that door tonight. I can be the reminder of fun, of youth, of being needed. Or maybe I could just be me—that's what started all this, wasn't it? But she'll still be the same. Cold.

""Man, why don't you just leave her? You're never happy."" My coworker leans back in his chair—the unwilling therapist of my lunch breaks.

""It'll be fine,"" I tell him. ""She's an amazing mother, honestly.""

He smirks like he's heard this a hundred times. ""Yeah, but there's a difference between being a good mother and being a good wife. You've got to communicate your needs as a man.""

But I have, haven't I? Have I not been clear enough? Or do I just know she won't do anything with it? Probably both. These talks aren't helpful. He just becomes another voice in my head—negative thoughts dressed as wisdom. Sure, in most marriages, communication is vital. But she doesn't need anything. She doesn't seem to want anything.

Life was simple once. Before kids. Before bills. Before alarms at 3:41 A.M. We were eager back then—chasing love like it might run away. She loved her body. She was confident. She had opinions, dreams, purpose. We talked for hours about the life we have now. And we built it.

So what happens when you get everything you ever wanted by age thirty? You have fun, right? You make new memories. You chase smaller dreams that keep you moving—a walk-in shower, a new kitchen, a family car, a trip together.

Then something shifts.

How about stop touching your husband... Or sit on your phone all night, scrolling past him. Or stop talking about your feelings altogether. And now the anger rises. The sadness follows. How did I end up back here again? Our long talks—the writing, the promises—did any of it help? Or am I just orbiting the same questions, over and over? My thoughts accelerate. My palms turn clammy. My breathing breaks rhythm.

""You good, dude?""

My coworker is still watching as I stand abruptly, slamming the door behind me, and rush to an empty break room. Another panic attack. First one in a month.

Look at yourself. You let her do this to you without her even trying. You think you deserve this? You think you've earned pain like this? There are soldiers who've seen children die, parents who've buried their own. And you? What have you suffered? Get away from me. You were gone. I got rid of you.

You convinced yourself of a lot of things. That you're not needed. That you can handle it alone. That being unseen makes you noble. You let a woman crawl into your mind and bring you to your knees. You think your ""good deeds"" make you strong? You think they'll save you from yourself? I never needed you. You're the Devil.

Please! What use would the Devil have for someone as small and as insignificant with all your ""problems""? I think he would have all the use in the world for them. For my soul. For every man’s soul. All at the same time.

You've truly fallen into delusion then. Blame the Devil for something you can't take control of. I can see the house peek over the hill as I approach, her car parked in its usual spot. A home that should be teeming with light and life instead looks cold and hollow. Pulling in, I kill the engine and sit for a moment. The plan I'd had earlier—to shower her with hugs and smiles—died sometime this afternoon.

In its place, something colder formed. I decided I wouldn't lay a finger on her tonight. I'd only respond if spoken to, and even then, only neutrally. I want to see if she'll break first. I know I'm playing games with my wife now, even if it's one-sided. But I tell myself it's a test—of our love, our compatibility. How long could I keep it up? Days? Weeks? Months?

Still, there's a small, cruel hope in me: that she'll come to my side, rub my shoulder, and bridge the distance I've built.

When I finally open the door, the house greets me with the sound of a children's show—bright voices echoing through a dim, airless room. No one in sight. I set my things down and take in the scene. Disaster. Stale food on the floor. Toys everywhere. Dishes stacked and buzzing with flies. I never asked for perfection. Never expected dinner waiting on the table. But I thought at least common sense might fill in the gaps. What has she been doing all day?

The answer finds me before I finish the thought. She's in the bedroom, the only light coming from her phone screen. The kids sleep beside her. She looks up at me, squinting through the dark.

""Hey,"" she says.

""Hi,"" I leave her with my reply and continue to the bathroom. Closing the door behind me, I sit on the toilet seat and just wait. What am I waiting for?

She's not going to ask me about my day. You were just the one second break in her infinite scrolling. God, I want to snatch that fucking phone right out of her hands and whip it towards a wall. I want it in pieces. I want her to be faced with what's happening around her.

""Hunny?""

Just then, her voice. From the other side of the door. This is a pivotal moment in my mind. I like to think the next words out of her mouth could change my entire outlook.

I respond, ""Yeah?""

""You gonna be long? Cause I gotta take a shower.""

THIS WAS IT. THIS WAS THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK. I AM AN OBSTACLE FOR HER TO MOVE AROUND. I AM THE EXTRA PAIR OF ARMS TO TAKE THE KIDS WHEN SHE NEEDS TO SCROLL. I AM THE MONEY MAKER, THE PERSONAL ACCOUNTANT, THE MAID!

SHE'S GONE. MY WIFE DOES NOT EXIST. IN HER PLACE IS NOW THIS THING! WALKING AROUND MY HOUSE DEAD. DEAD LIKE A GIRL'S BODY WHO WASHED UP ON SHORE. SHE HAS NO LEAVES. SHE CREAKS AND GROANS AND SNAPS WITH THE WIND. HER FOUNDATION IS DYING!

""Be out in a sec,"" I respond softly.

**PART 3: US**

Three days. We have not touched each other in three days. We exchange information on a need-to-know basis. I listen to a few snarky comments about her work. Received a ""good night"" the first day, but not these last two. We are just floating around each other, completing daily tasks for the children. If it wasn't for the kids, we might be considered complete robots in this house.

Of course, this is all devastating. I really believed I'd break by the first night after seeing a glimpse of hope in her. Something to make me throw it all out and get back to living. I did not anticipate three days and counting.

I cannot think at work. My mind is somewhere else. I'm afraid I'm beginning to look like her from the outside. Whatever disease she has is affecting me. A dying disease. The children most definitely feel this, even though they can't say it. I can see the confusion in their eyes. I feel their distress and frustrations. They've been especially hard these last few days.

I'm just tired. I've been fighting an emotional battle for too long. I believe my body is telling me that it must come to an end.

Is this justifiable enough? If I slid her a paper that said ""Petition for Divorce"" across it, how would she react? Maybe she would hide a moment of relief behind aggravation. What a waste. A waste of life and time. But what about the kids? Am I dooming them to a reality that's now split? What kind of mental turmoil would they accumulate under the surface, I wonder. Things they would only later on in life be able to diagnose.

""Oh, I must have felt this way because I watched my parents go through a divorce when I was young.""

""I never felt the effective operation of a real family dynamic because my dad split with my mom.""

""Mom's new boyfriend beats her up cause she stopped having sex with him.""

I can hear it all now. But this isn't MY fault. I would have never built a future around someone if I could have foreseen this. That's not to say I regret my children. They're the only thing that keeps me going.

I stand in the kitchen with a cup of coffee pressed to my nose, waiting for it to cool. From the corner of my eye, I see her stumble out of the bedroom and make a beeline for the couch. That cushion must be molded to her by now. I feel the glare forming before I can stop it—so I smooth my face.

""Where's the remote?"" she asks through a yawn.

I wait a beat. ""Good morning.""

She digs into the couch, pulling out toy cars, broken graham crackers, a sock. ""Hunny, did you lose the remote?"" she says, not hearing me at all.

""Good morning,"" I repeat, a little sharper this time.

""Seriously, now I can't turn shows on for the kids. God damn it."" Her hands slap her lap—that sound of defeat.

""GOOD MORNING!"" I yell, the words ripping out of me before I can stop them. The whole house jolts awake. She jumps, eyes wide, confusion freezing her face.

""What the fuck?"" she stammers.

Through the monitor, the baby starts crying. Of course.

""Why did you do that? You fucking woke him up."" She stands, disgust curling her lip as she moves past me toward the bedroom. ""The fuck is wrong with you?""

I blow across the top of my coffee, steadying myself for the storm I just invited.

SCREAMING. CRYING. YANKING. SPILLING. THROWING.

The house is chaos today. I sit with my feet up on the ottoman. Comfy. My second cup of coffee now room temp. She darts back and forth, addressing one disaster after another. She's covered in damp drool and tears. Maybe a bit of apple sauce too. Or puke. I don't know. She looks towards me with that disgusted look again.

""Are you gonna do anything?"" she yells over the sounds of a possessed two-year-old. He thrashes on the floor, inconsolable. In the background, the youngest cries to be freed from the constraints of his high chair.

""I can't hear you. There's too many kids screaming,"" I say calmly.

Without responding, she scoffs and grits her teeth. She blocks me out with a face that says, ""I'll deal with that comment later."" She yells at the two-year-old to get up onto his feet. I can see her hairline drenched in sweat.

Now in this instance, I would never let things get this out of control normally. I'd be rushing to her side, distracting the youngest with freedom and flying away with the possessed two-year-old, somewhere we could contain the sounds. But if I'm being honest, I kind of liked this. The more they cried, the more frustrated she got, the better I felt.

Normal parts of my subconscious would tell me I'm being an asshole. But it's quiet. As if my body and mind have found the best path forward. A collected agreement, to salvage our mind and our soul. I've been fighting too long. I've given up what felt like everything that made me ME.

""I can't drive a manual, get rid of that dumb car. It's not a family car anyways.""

""These hunting trips are really not helpful when I'm stuck with the kids.""

""I don't want your friends coming here, they're too loud and they'll wake the kids up.""

I think eventually it'll whittle down, and I'll be the only thing left to remove. It's frightening how fast the mind can evolve. How fast conclusions can form. Just a week ago, I was fantasizing about her. Some invisible love I thought was between us. But I was naive.

How many times would I go back and forth between two realities? Which one is true? Maybe neither of them are, maybe it's something in between.

No. I'm on the right path. I'm sticking to my guns. Just stop thinking so much.

After enduring a napless day, the kids quickly fell asleep. If this were any other night, it would be a great opportunity to hang out! Kids are out early, gaining an extra hour of time. Shame. From the passing looks on her face, I could tell she was exhausted. She would probably go to sleep herself soon.

She catches me in the bathroom, brushing my teeth. I don't look up, but I feel her eyes on me.

""What's going on?"" she asks, exasperated.

Mouth still full of toothpaste, I answer flatly, ""What's up?""

She stares, brow raised, scowling. ""You've been acting weird. You didn't really help with the kids at all today either, so that's awesome.""

I keep my eyes on the mirror and spit. ""Yeah? Well, I'm sorry. I feel fine.""

She exhales hard, shaking her head as her shoulders drop. ""Whatever. Goodnight."" She starts down the dark hallway.

""That's it?"" I call out before she's gone.

She stops, sighs. ""What do you mean?""

I turn to face her. ""You don't have anything else to say?""

She opens her hands and lets them slap her thighs. ""Nope. You obviously want to fight about something.""

""Oh, I do? Or maybe I just want to hear what my wife's thinking.""

""Hah."" She shakes her head, eyes closed. ""What do you want me to say?""

I lean against the doorframe, closing the space between us. ""I want you to express something. I want you to show me that you feel anything—even a little bit—about us.""

She snaps back, ""I feel fine. The kids are a lot, and it'd be nice to have some help, hunny. I'm tired.""

""You're tired? I've been tired for a year!"" My voice rises.

She covers her face. ""Oh my god. Please.""

I stand upright now, jaw set. ""See? You don't care. I've been shouting it from the rooftops—I'm not okay! This relationship isn't okay. You're just someone I live with.""

She lowers her hands and stares through me. ""Okay. Then divorce me. I don't know what you want from me.""

""Okay,"" I say quietly.

She doesn't react—she's already left the conversation in her head.

""Yeah. Awesome."" She turns away.

Her footsteps fade down the hall. I stand in the doorway, toothbrush still in hand. I get a sense she doesn't realize that I'm honest in my response. Doesn't matter. That was all I needed to hear. My mind was teetering before, but now it's clear. The fight isn't what hurts anymore, it's knowing that I've stopped wanting to fix it.

I want to divorce my wife.

**PART 4: THE END OF THE WORLD**

""Petition for Dissolution of Marriage.""

The freshly printed document sits on my desk. Blank. My hand holds a pen.

Click. Click. Click.

I can't believe this is the culmination. Signing it would make everything real. For now, it's just paper—harmless in its stillness.

I picture her reaction. Relief, probably. Maybe she's been waiting for me to make the first move, so she can say, ""He's the one who wanted to end it. I was happy. He was delusional.""

A sigh escapes—half dread, half release. I don't give my thoughts time to negotiate with my heart. I press the pen down and begin to write.

As usual, I rise over the hill and see the house. Empty. Her car's gone. Unusual for a Monday at four. She always leaves work, picks up the kids, and comes straight home. They're too much for her to manage anywhere else. Maybe she's grocery shopping. Maybe she's with someone else. I don't care.

I pull into the drive and pinch the folded paper between my fingers like it's something fragile. The sidewalk is lined with forgotten toys—sun-bleached, dirt-caked, wrecked by rain. I was always too lazy to put them away. Maybe I hoped they'd be used again someday.

We used to play outside together. We used to take pictures, view them later after the kids fell asleep, and laugh. Time stood still back then. Now, the toys are relics of something that withered—something that never had the nurture to grow.

I kneel down and run my hand across a pair of rusted training wheels. I spin them and watch the rim turn until it slows to a stop.

Tears erupt.

I TRIED. GOD KNOWS I TRIED AND I CAN DIE IN CONTENT KNOWING I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT. KNOWING THAT I DIDN'T THROW A SECOND MORE OF MY LIFE AWAY.

Oh God. Please help me get through this one.

It's been two hours. I've held the same position at the head of the dining room table for two hours. The paper in front of me. I can hear the hands of a wall clock tick. Every second I exhale, it's like sick air leaving my lungs.

I've been waiting for that sound. The click of a door handle. Now that my mind accepts that this is over, it floods with the image of adultery. I see her laughing, her hands running across the chest of another man. A man more masculine than me. I see them making love. She cries out like she's been holding it in all along. I can feel my grip tighten in my sweaty palms.

I shouldn't care, really. As far as I'm concerned, she can go on and fuck up someone else's life all she wants the second she signs this. I feel bad for the poor bastard that pours his heart out to her. A guy who doesn't know she'll go cold the second she's done with him.

I'm reminded of her mother. A woman who's been through two failed marriages, and is currently on her third. Was this seed planted long ago? Was my wife predestined to fall out of love? There's a fine line between influence and inheritance. I don't think I'm comfortable with either answer.

Click.

I hear the door open. I pull my hands from under my chin and sit upright. My heart begins to beat a little faster now. I hear the kids stumble into the house. I hear the crinkling of plastic bags. Then, her voice. Out of breath.

""Okay, go find daddy.""

The kids run past the dining room; they don't notice me. I hear her footsteps follow. The heart rate increases a bit more. Finally, she comes into view. She's holding grocery sacks and has a diaper bag hanging off one shoulder. Her hair is tangled and messy. She breathes heavily. She stops and examines me for a moment.

""What're you doing?""

I don't respond. Instead, my eye gestures to the paper. She speaks like she's got other things to attend to: ""Hunny, what? What is that?""

I lean forward and rest my elbows on the table. ""We need to talk,"" I say softly.

She looks at the paper, then back at me. Then back at the paper. She slowly stumbles across the room, her bags dragging. She leans over the table and squints. Her head shoots back up towards me. Her expression is horrified.

""What? Hunny, what the fuck is this?""

I blink slowly and inhale before spilling the news. ""We need to start this process. It'll be harder if we sit on—""

I'm cut off by her eruption of tears and shock.

""No! What are you doing right now? Are you fucking kidding me?"" She lets all her bags drop out of her arms as her hands cup her mouth. Her eyes are piercing and welling up. I resist the urge but I can feel the lump in my throat growing. My eyes fill with pressure. The sight of her like this has always broken me. Even now.

""PLEASE. DO NOT ACT LIKE THIS RIGH—""

I'm cut off again.

""SO I MADE ONE SARCASTIC COMMENT OUT OF ANGER AND YOU SERIOUSLY GO AND DO THIS? YOU WANT TO DIVORCE ME?"" She's unraveling.

I can feel my tears forming but I stop them in their tracks.

""This cannot be happening right now. Oh my God, I feel sick. Please. Please, please tell me this isn't real,"" she pleads. She begins to back away.

I don't know what to feel in this moment. I didn't expect this reaction from her. As if she's blindsided by this. How could that be possible? It's been so obvious for so long!

""Stop pretending like you love me! You haven't for a long time!"" I yell with my eyes closed.

She lowers her hands as a newfound shock crawls across her face. ""You think I don't love you?""

I say the obvious, ""I'm your husband. I know you better than anyone in the world. I can see that I'm just someone that's in your life. Not a part of it.""

""DAVID!"" she yells. ""I LOVE YOU! I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU!""

I shake my head and let it hang. ""Please don't say that. YOU'RE LYING TO YOURSELF!""

""You're the only person I ever wanted to spend my life with,"" she adds.

""Stop. Right now."" My voice is buried in my chest.

She begins to step closer. Trying to make her words clearer. ""You've seen me at my absolute worst. Lately it's been hard. Yes. Okay? My body doesn't feel like mine and I've gone through this before and we talked about it then and we talked about it with this last pregnancy too!""

Her voice is pleading harder now. ""I was waiting. And I thought you were waiting too. Waiting for this to pass so we could get back to being us. Also—"" she begins to dig in her pocket. She pulls out a single packaged tampon and throws it on the table. ""—I'M ON MY PERIOD! I GET CRANKY, DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T LOVE YOU, DAVID!"" she yells in anger now.

""Sign the paper, Mel."" I can't take her words anymore. Every stab of confession feels like it's tearing my mind apart.

She's frozen. Just staring at me. Trying to really figure it out for herself. Or maybe she's just mustering up some emotional excuse to keep me holding out a little longer. I see the kids wander up to the edge of the room. They keep their distance. Watching as if they know.

When she speaks now, it's quiet and pointed. ""Hunny. I think you have some serious issues you need to work out. You've built up some—"" her tears break her words, ""—some kind of delusion, I think. I love you, but if you can honestly sit there and believe this, without a shadow of a doubt, then I don't know what else to say.""

She squats down in a catcher's position and lets her head fall into her hands. Her dangling hair covers her face. I hear her whisper to the floor, ""I always loved you...""

I sit on her words for a moment.

You know this is all for show, right? You know she's afraid that if you leave, it'd be a huge inconvenience for her. Who's gonna help with kids and pay the water bill this month? I don't need you for this.

Are you joking? This is your test! If you break now, right here, then you are doomed to be a prisoner for the rest of your life. A prisoner to his own mind. Who's too afraid. You need me in this moment more than you've ever needed me. My mind darts. Now all the voices come back at once. My heart racing faster now.

SHE'S STILL LYING! YOU'RE FOLDING. YOU'RE A BOY! SHE FANTASIZES ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE! TOUCHING YOU DISGUSTS HER! SHE HATES EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU! A warm hand on the side of my face. It all stops. The voices fade. The air goes still. I open my eyes and I see hers. Deep, beautiful brown eyes. She's searching for something in mine. As if she's telling me to fight.

All the sounds fade away now. There's nothing. Nothing but us. Silence breaks when her lips form.

""I love you."" She breathes the words. I feel her breath hit me. So close. Her fingers brush away a tear drying on the corner of my eye. Her tears, still falling.

My heart slows down. Way, way down. Thump, thump... thump... thump.

1qlsd42,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1qlsd42/lost_20_kgs_still_feel_small/,Lost 20 kgs still feel small,"I’m 19 years old, and I started my Mounjaro journey in September. At that time, I weighed 86 kg at 158 cm. As of now, I’ve lost almost 20 kg and I’m down to 66 kg.

Even after losing so much weight, I don’t feel as comfortable or confident as I thought I would. I still have around 15 kg more to lose, and I’m continuing this journey  but emotionally, it hasn’t been as simple as I imagined especially nowadays.

Some days I feel genuinely proud of myself. I feel lighter, stronger, and more confident than I’ve been in the last four or five years. But on other days, my insecurities feel louder than ever. I catch myself comparing my body to slimmer girls their social lives, their confidence, the way they seem to exist so effortlessly in the world and suddenly, I feel small again.

Today, something very simple affected me deeply. I went to try on a bra, and the salesgirl said that finding my size would be extremely difficult because not many women have such large sizes, her words stayed with me longer than I expected, i know it's more about my apple sized body because I fit into a S size jeans perfectly with midly thick thighs but even this is effecting me.

Even though I’ve changed so much physically, moments like these remind me of the girl I used to be the “fat girl” I’ve been for most of my life. I rapidly gained weight after I got my periods, and since then I’ve always seen myself as the short, overweight girl. 

Because of that, I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin from teenage, 
I had little to no friends not because I didn’t want them, but because I felt embarrassed talking to boys and constantly intimidated by girls. I would compare myself to them their makeup, their hair, their bodies, and I always felt like I fell short.

My confidence slowly disappeared. Over time, I stopped trying. After feeling like a side character for so long ignored, overlooked, bullied and unseen in my previous friend circles my mind learned to protect itself by pretending it no longer wanted connection at all from anyone.

I told myself I was fine being alone.
Yet even now, I catch myself staring at groups of friends laughing together, wishing quietly that I could be part of something like that, currently i am hoping that things will change after i lose 15 kgs

Ironically, this is the thinnest I’ve been in years, yet my insecurities haven’t disappeared. In some ways, they feel stronger. Every small comment, every glance, every comparison affects me more now than it did before. The closer I get to my goal weight, the more emotional I become almost as if I’m grieving the years I spent uncomfortable in my own body.

I am proud of how far I’ve come. Only I know how much pain I’ve endured on this medicine  the nausea, diarrhea, cramps, vomiting. Even today, when I order my favorite cheat meal or a coffee, I rarely finish it. Not because of the medication anymore, but because my mind carries a constant fear: that if I eat it all, I’ll somehow end up back where I started and the little confidence i gained would again be lost, till today i haven't eaten my favourite lays from September.

Through all of this, I’m slowly learning that weight loss doesn’t automatically heal the mind and experiences, I don't know what is going to happen in my life from now on but somehow I still don't feel good. ",2,1769274228.0,emotionalneglect,0,1.0,False

I share a kitchen with other students, and one of the male students constantly tries to talk to me. He asks about my plans, wants to get coffee with me, and keeps initiating conversation even though we have nothing in common. I’m not attracted to men at all, and this makes me feel uneasy in a space that’s supposed to feel neutral and safe. I don’t think I’ve given any signals of interest, yet the attention continues.

There’s also a situation with a woman I met about three months ago. We spent one night together, but I quickly realized that I’m not attracted to her. I find her very basic, overly people-pleasing, emotionally immature, and honestly, boring. Since it was her first experience with a woman, she developed an intense attachment and almost an obsession with me. She’s overly attentive, takes photos of me, and seems very focused on me in a way that feels too much.

I have clearly told her three separate times that I only want to be friends. The first time was when I noticed I didn’t feel any attraction and suggested we just be friends and get to know each other. The second time, I said something similar again. Later, because I’m new in the country, I invited her somewhere so I wouldn’t go alone — but she interpreted that as flirting, which made me very uncomfortable. The third time, I explicitly told her that I’m not emotionally available.

After that, we didn’t talk for a month. Then we ran into each other through a mutual friend, and she showed up wearing a quite sexual outfit. The fact that she still seems to see me as a potential romantic or sexual option makes me deeply uncomfortable. When she’s not flirting, she behaves rudely, which I think comes from emotional immaturity.

All of this makes me question myself: am I too distant or cold, or are these reactions actually normal?",1,1769274130.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Not the kind you picture when someone says the word out loud.

This was “recovery.” “reclaiming.” “retrieval.”

That’s what the guy on the burner phone called it, anyway—like changing the label changed what it was.

He didn’t give me a name. I didn’t give him mine. He sent a pin, a time, and a sentence that stuck to the roof of my mouth all day like peanut butter:

“The owners aren’t home. The security is old. Don’t get sentimental.”

I wasn’t sentimental. I was broke.

It was late fall and the air had that damp bite that makes everything smell like wet leaves and cold metal. I parked a few streets away because I’d seen enough true crime to know “right in front” is how you end up in a documentary. I walked the rest of the way with a small backpack, black gloves, and a cheap headlamp I’d tested in my bathroom mirror until it made me look like a raccoon.

The mansion sat back off the road behind a fence that was more for show than function. Wrought iron, ornate curls, a gate that didn’t look locked so much as it looked offended you thought it might be.

The driveway was long and pale, lined with stone planters and little ground lights that were off. No motion sensors. No barking dogs. No cameras tracking me with a tiny red dot.

When I tell you that should have been my first warning, I mean it.

It was too easy. Like walking into a store where every employee is suddenly “in the back.”

The side door was where the guy said it would be—by a breezeway leading to a garage the size of my entire apartment building. The lock was older. Not ancient, just… neglected. You could feel it in the way the keyway accepted the pick like it was tired of pretending.

It clicked open in under a minute.

I stood there in the narrow slice of dark between outside and inside, and I had that brief, stupid thought: If I turn around right now, nothing happens.

But my bank app was a horror story all on its own. So I slipped in and shut the door behind me.

The mansion smelled like expensive wood and something citrusy—cleaning product, maybe. The kind of scent that’s meant to signal wealth the way perfume signals desire. It wasn’t dusty. It wasn’t abandoned.

It was maintained.

The guy had said the owners weren’t home, but the place felt like someone had just walked out ten minutes ago.

I found the hallway he’d described. Marble flooring. A runner rug that looked like it cost more than my car. Framed photos along the walls in heavy frames—artsy, angled shots of people I didn’t recognize laughing over drinks, posed on boats, standing in front of snow-covered mountains.

No kids. No pets.

Just… adults with money and time.

My instructions were simple: office, second floor. Small safe behind a painting. “Blue velvet box” inside it. Take the box. Leave everything else.

That should’ve made it easier, right? A single target. No rummaging, no temptation.

Except as I walked past the open archway to the living room, I saw a display case.

Glass. Lit from inside.

And on a velvet stand, a watch.

Not just any watch. The watch. The kind men post online with their sleeves pulled up and captions like “hard work pays off.” The kind my ex used to send me screenshots of with a laughing emoji like we weren’t arguing about groceries.

I stopped. I shouldn’t have. I know I shouldn’t have. But my brain did that quick, vicious math it always does when I see something valuable:

Sell that and you’re not just surviving. You’re breathing.

I stared at the lock on the display case. Tiny. Simple. Like it was there to keep out curious guests, not someone who showed up with gloves and a headlamp.

I told myself one extra thing didn’t change the crime. Like there’s a moral difference between stealing a box and stealing a box plus a watch.

I popped the case with a quiet click and slid the watch into my pocket.

Then I kept moving, a little faster now, because that’s the thing about stealing—you don’t feel guilty so much as you feel hungry. One bite makes you want another.

The staircase was wide and carpeted, the kind that makes your footsteps disappear. Upstairs, the hallway branched. The office was at the end, double doors with brass handles.

I pushed them open.

The office was dark except for the faint glow of city light coming through tall windows. There was a big desk, a leather chair, shelves full of books people buy to look impressive. In the far corner hung a painting—abstract, expensive-looking, all moody blues and blacks.

Behind that painting, the guy said, was the safe.

I crossed the room and lifted the edge of the frame—

—and the lights came on.

Not one by one. Not flickering.

Full, bright overhead light. Like a stage.

I froze so hard my shoulders ached.

Then the office door behind me clicked.

A lock engaging.

Not a latch settling. A real lock. Mechanical. Final.

My mouth went dry.

I spun and ran to the doors and yanked.

Locked.

I threw my shoulder into them.

Nothing. Not even a rattle. Like the door was part of the wall now.

Behind me, something made a soft sound.

A chair moving.

I turned slowly, and that’s when I saw him.

He was sitting behind the desk like he’d been there the whole time, like I’d walked into his office hours late and interrupted him. Dark clothes. No mask. No dramatic hood. Just… a man, calm as a person waiting for a late delivery.

He looked up from a notebook.

Not angry.

Not excited.

Mildly annoyed.

Like I was a telemarketer.

“Hi,” he said. Then, with the energy of someone clocking in, “Okay. Here we go.”

My throat tightened. “Who are you?”

He sighed, like I’d asked him to explain the concept of gravity.

“I’m the person who owns the house you broke into,” he said. “Or, more accurately, I’m the person who keeps the house you broke into.”

He set the notebook down and laced his fingers together.

“And you,” he added, eyes sweeping over me like he was inspecting a dent in a car, “are underdressed for this. But points for the gloves. It’s always the gloves. People act like wearing gloves makes them invisible.”

My heart was hammering so hard it made my ears ring. I backed away from the desk, eyes darting to windows, to anything.

The windows were tall, but the glass looked thick. The kind that doesn’t shatter when you throw a chair at it. The kind rich people pay for because they don’t like surprises.

“Let me out,” I said.

He blinked once. Slow. “No.”

“I’ll… I’ll leave. I won’t tell anyone. I—”

“Sure,” he said, like I’d offered him a coupon. “And I’ll grow wings and start migrating.”

He leaned forward slightly, elbows on the desk. “How’s your night going? You feeling successful? You get what you came for?”

I didn’t answer.

His eyes flicked to my pocket.

“Ah,” he said. “That’s a yes.”

I felt my stomach drop. I hadn’t made a sound. I hadn’t turned my head. But he knew.

He tapped the notebook with one finger. “Let’s do inventory, since you’re going to pretend you didn’t.”

I stared at him, breathing shallow.

“You came for a velvet box,” he said, as if reading a grocery list. “You also took the watch from the case downstairs. The one you thought was ‘easy.’”

My blood went cold.

He continued, unfazed. “You also pocketed the silver letter opener from the hallway table when you came in. The one shaped like a bird.”

I instinctively touched my bag.

It was there. I hadn’t even remembered grabbing it.

He nodded like he’d expected that. “And you moved the small sculpture on the living room shelf. Didn’t take it, but you moved it. Left fingerprints on the base even with gloves. That’s the fun part. Everyone has a tell.”

“How do you—” I started.

“Know?” he finished. “Because you’re not the first.”

He flipped a page in the notebook like this was a routine he did every week.

“Two weeks ago,” he said, “a guy with a crowbar took a bracelet from the upstairs bathroom. He broke my sink. I didn’t love that. Last month, someone tried for the wine cellar. She got stuck in the pantry for three hours and cried so hard she threw up. The month before that—”

My skin crawled. “Why is this happening?”

“Because someone tells them,” he said simply. “Someone always tells them. People don’t just wake up and decide to play burglar roulette on a mansion in the woods. They get a whisper. A nudge. A little promise.”

He looked at me like I was slow. “You got a whisper.”

“I was hired.”

“Mm-hmm.” He sat back. “And you believed it would be clean. Transactional. You steal, you get paid, you go home. You don’t think about who set the table.”

He watched my face for a beat, then shrugged.

“Anyway,” he said, brightening like the topic had shifted to the weather, “you’re in my office. You’re locked in. You’re going to give me back what you took, and then you’re going to answer a few questions.”

I shook my head. “No.”

His eyebrows lifted. “No?”

“No,” I repeated, because my mouth moved faster than my brain. “I’m leaving.”

He stared at me like I’d just told him I planned to breathe underwater.

Then he reached under the desk.

I flinched hard enough my shoulders tensed, ready for a gun.

What he pulled out wasn’t a gun.

It was a small remote.

He pressed a button.

Somewhere in the room, a speaker clicked on—hidden, clean, built into the walls.

A voice came through it.

Not his.

A recording.

A woman’s voice, strained and trembling.

“Please,” it said. “Please don’t—”

The sound cut off with a sharp click.

My stomach dropped. I felt my skin prickle.

He watched me watch him, expression unreadable.

“That,” he said, “is what ‘no’ sounds like in here.”

I couldn’t speak. My tongue felt glued to my teeth.

He set the remote down gently.

“Now,” he said, “I can do this the patient way or the messy way. And I hate messy. Messy is work.”

I clenched my jaw. “What do you want.”

He smiled. “That’s the first honest thing you’ve said.”

He gestured toward my pocket. “You’re going to put the watch on the desk.”

I didn’t move.

He tilted his head. “Or… you don’t. And I take it off you. Which is harder. Which is messy.”

I stared at him, and I hated that the calmness worked. Hated that my body believed it.

Slowly, with shaking fingers, I pulled the watch out and placed it on the desk.

He nodded. “Good. Now the letter opener.”

I set it down too.

“Great,” he said. “Now the velvet box you came for.”

“I don’t have it.”

“You don’t have it yet. You were about to.” He sighed like I was exhausting him. “Okay. Fine. We’ll do it another way.”

He opened his notebook again. “Tell me who sent you.”

I shook my head.

He waited. Patient.

I realized then the silence in the mansion wasn’t the absence of people.

It was control.

“I don’t know,” I lied. “It was just a number.”

He sighed.

Then he pressed the remote again.

The speaker clicked.

This time it wasn’t a voice.

It was a sound.

A low, wet scraping, followed by a muffled sob, followed by something that sounded like… fingernails dragging on wood.

My stomach rolled.

The sound stopped.

He didn’t look at the speaker. He looked at me. Like he was watching a reaction video.

“I keep receipts,” he said. “Not money receipts. Behavioral receipts.”

“What is that,” I whispered.

He shrugged. “A reminder that you’re in a place where the rules aren’t yours.”

“Who sent you,” he repeated, still flat.

“I don’t know,” I said, and this time it was half true. I didn’t know a name. I didn’t know a face. I knew a voice on a phone and a promise.

His eyes narrowed—not angry. Focused.

He stood and came toward me. This time he didn’t stop halfway.

I backed up until my calves hit the edge of a leather couch I hadn’t noticed before.

“Stop,” I said.

He stopped—not because he respected it, but because he wanted me to notice he stopped.

“I hate when people make this physical,” he said, sounding genuinely inconvenienced. “It’s always such an overreaction.”

Then he moved.

He grabbed my wrist, twisted, and pain tore through me like a bright flash.

I made a noise I’m not proud of. My knees buckled.

He didn’t let go. He guided me down to the floor, like he was kneeling a kid for a photo.

“I’m not breaking it,” he said conversationally. “Not yet. I’m just making it difficult for you to do dumb stuff.”

He released me, and I cradled my wrist against my chest, breathing hard.

He picked up my backpack, unzipped it, and rummaged with the casual familiarity of someone going through their own drawer.

He pulled out my phone.

“No service,” he said, turning it over. Then he looked at me. “Still want to pretend you’re in control?”

“What do you want,” I repeated, smaller.

He smiled. “You already asked. That means you’re learning.”

He walked back behind the desk, set my phone down, and tapped his notebook.

“Do you know what you stole,” he asked, “before tonight?”

I stared at him. “Nothing.”

“Sure you did,” he said. “Not from here. From the area.”

He rattled it off like weather.

“A red scarf from a car on the side of the road. A camera from a campsite. Tools from a garage. Cash from a tip jar. A necklace off a hook.”

My stomach twisted.

“You took the watch because it made you feel like you deserved to breathe,” he said. “Like wearing something expensive would make you a different person.”

My wrist throbbed with every heartbeat.

“And the velvet box?” he added, pointing toward the painting. “Doesn’t matter. That’s just bait. That’s just to get you in the room.”

My blood went cold.

“You’re lying,” I said, but it came out thin.

He stood, slid the painting aside, and knocked once on the safe door.

A soft click answered from inside.

Then the safe opened by itself.

My stomach dropped.

Inside weren’t stacks of cash.

Inside were rows of small velvet boxes—different colors, different sizes—each labeled with tape and a date.

Like evidence.

He pulled out a blue velvet box and held it up without opening it.

“You were hired to steal this,” he said, “because whoever hired you wanted to see if you’d do it.”

He set it on the desk gently.

“Now,” he said, “tell me who sent you.”

“I don’t know,” I whispered.

He sighed dramatically. “God, this is boring. You’re making it boring.”

He picked up my phone again.

It lit up in his hand.

Full bars.

That shouldn’t have been possible, but it was.

He turned it so I could see the contact name on the screen:

HOME

The phone started ringing.

He didn’t answer it right away. He just watched me.

“Go ahead,” he said. “Pick it up.”

I shook my head. “No.”

He answered it himself, put it on speaker, and set it down.

A man’s voice filled the room.

Sarcastic. Familiar. Mildly irritated.

“Did she take it?” the voice asked.

The man at the desk smiled like someone who’d just heard their favorite song.

“She took the watch,” he said into the phone. “And a letter opener. She almost took the box. She’s trying her best.”

A pause.

Then the voice on the phone laughed softly. “Always with the watch.”

My brain refused to line the pieces up because lining them up meant admitting something impossible.

The man looked at me like I was slow.

“Say hi,” he told me.

The phone voice went warmer, intimate in a way that made my skin crawl.

“Hi.”

Same voice.

Because it was him.

Not a helper. Not a client.

Just him, playing both sides like it was a game.

“You hired me,” I said, and my voice shook.

He shrugged. “Yeah.”

“Why?”

He leaned on the desk, casual. “Because you were willing.”

The phone crackled faintly.

“Send her out,” the voice said. “I’m hungry.”

I flinched. “Hungry?”

“Not like that,” the man said, waving a hand like I was being dramatic. “Not teeth. Not blood. Not unless you make it complicated.”

He walked to the office doors and unlocked them with the remote.

The doors swung open.

A hallway beyond—dark now, like the mansion had swallowed its own lights.

Somewhere deeper inside, something moved. Slow footsteps. Patient. A soft drag that could’ve been fabric… or nails.

The man stepped aside and nodded toward the hall.

“Good news,” he said lightly. “You’re not trapped anymore.”

My throat tightened. “You’re letting me go?”

He blinked. “No.”

He smiled, bright and mean.

“I’m letting you run.”

I didn’t remember standing up.

I remember the sound behind me getting closer, like someone strolling through their own home.

I remember my wrist screaming when I pushed off the floor.

And I remember running into the dark hallway of a mansion that suddenly felt enormous, every doorway a mouth, every corner a place something could wait.

Behind me, the man called out, cheerful, like he was waving goodbye.

“Try the front door first,” he said. “It’s always funny.”

The hallway lights snapped off.

Not a dim. Not a fade.

Off.

My headlamp beam cut a thin tunnel through the dark, and the mansion felt wrong in it—too glossy, too quiet, too sure of itself.

I sprinted blind, following memory and panic, trying to picture the layout I’d walked through earlier like it was a map in my head.

A corner. A staircase. The living room archway—

Something moved at the edge of my light, not fully stepping into it. Like it didn’t need to. Like it was content to let me burn energy.

I hit the staircase and took it two steps at a time.

My bad wrist made my balance weird. My fingers tingled. I kept expecting it to give out completely.

At the bottom, I turned too sharp.

My shoulder slammed the wall.

The headlamp beam swung wide, and I caught a flash of the glass display case.

The one I’d opened.

It was shattered now.

Not broken like an accident—shattered like someone had hit it from the inside.

I barely registered it before my foot slid.

My boot came down on a scatter of glass. It skated.

I went down hard.

My knee hit first. My hip. Then my palm—my good hand—caught a slice of something sharp.

But the worst wasn’t my hand.

It was my thigh.

A long, hot line of pain opened up above my knee like someone had drawn a razor across me.

I screamed without meaning to.

Warmth spilled immediately, fast enough that my jeans went heavy and sticky in seconds.

My headlamp rolled and pointed at the ceiling, turning the world into a sick white glare.

I scrambled upright, grabbing my leg.

Blood soaked through my fingers.

Not a little. Not a scrape.

Enough that I felt lightheaded instantly, like my body was already pulling the “hey, this is serious” lever.

From the dark hallway behind me, I heard a sound.

Not footsteps.

A soft, pleased exhale.

Then his voice—close, annoyed, like I’d dropped a plate.

“Oh, for—”

He stepped into my headlamp beam like he’d been following at a leisurely pace the whole time.

He looked down at the blood on my hands, then at the shattered case, then back at me.

His expression wasn’t horror.

It was irritation.

“You know,” he said, “I had that case custom-made.”

I pressed my back to the wall, sliding down, shaking. “Stay away.”

He held up both hands like I was being dramatic in public.

“I’m not going to kill you,” he said. “Don’t flatter yourself.”

He crouched in front of me, eyes flicking to my thigh.

The blood kept coming. I could feel it running down my leg into my sock.

His mouth tightened. “That’s… inconvenient.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded cloth—clean, white, too neat. He pressed it hard to the wound like he’d done this before.

I flinched and tried to push him away with my injured wrist. Pain shot up my arm and I hissed.

He glanced at my wrist like it offended him too. “You’re falling apart.”

“Why are you doing this,” I whispered.

He looked up at me, eyes flat.

“Because you take what isn’t yours,” he said. “Because you tell yourself you’re just doing what you have to. Because you want the world to be soft when you’re desperate.”

He pressed harder on my leg. Stars popped behind my eyes.

Then he leaned in, voice low and dry.

“And because if you bleed out on my floor, it becomes a paperwork situation.”

I stared at him, dizzy. “You’re… taking me… to a hospital?”

He made a face like I’d asked him to spend the weekend with my family.

“Yes,” he said. “Unfortunately.”

He stood, still holding pressure with the cloth, and clicked something on the remote.

Somewhere, a door unlocked with a soft, obedient sound.

“Here’s the deal,” he said, voice brightening like he was laying out house rules. “You’re going to the ER. You’re getting stitches. You’re getting your wrist checked because you’re going to pretend it’s fine and then it’ll be a fun surprise later.”

He looked me over.

“And then,” he added, “you’re going to leave. Because I’m not a monster.”

I laughed—one sharp, broken sound. “You’re not?”

He smiled like I’d finally said something entertaining.

“I’m a correction,” he said.

He hauled me up like I weighed nothing and half-dragged, half-walked me through the mansion. My vision pulsed. The floor seemed to tilt.

The front door opened before we reached it.

Of course it did.

Outside, his car was waiting in the driveway like it had always been there.

He put me in the passenger seat with an efficiency that felt practiced—seat belt clicked, cloth pressed to my leg, my wrist folded into my lap like it was an object that needed to behave.

He slid into the driver’s seat, started the engine, and pulled away without hurry.

I watched the mansion disappear behind the trees.

It didn’t feel like escape.

It felt like being moved to a different room.

The hospital lights were too bright. The waiting room smelled like stale coffee and disinfectant and fear.

He walked me in with one hand at my elbow like a concerned partner.

“Found her on the side of the road,” he told the triage nurse, voice bored but convincing. “Glass. She fell.”

The nurse looked at me. “Is that what happened?”

My throat tightened.

His fingers pressed lightly into my arm—nothing painful, just enough to remind me he could make it painful whenever he wanted.

I swallowed. “Yes.”

He smiled faintly, like I’d done a good job.

They took me back fast because I was bleeding through the cloth.

A doctor asked questions. I answered in short sentences. First name only. No details. No story that could be checked.

They numbed my leg and I stared at the ceiling tiles while they stitched me up, counting staples in the acoustic panels because I needed something to do with my brain besides scream.

My wrist got wrapped too. Not broken, but sprained bad enough that the doctor said “no lifting” and looked at me like I was going to do it anyway.

When it was done, when my thigh was bandaged and my wrist was immobilized and my paperwork was handed over, I looked around for him.

He was sitting in the corner chair of the discharge area, legs crossed, scrolling his phone like he was waiting for a table at a restaurant.

He looked up when he saw me.

“Oh good,” he said. “You’re functional again.”

I tried to stand and my leg screamed. I wobbled.

He stood, caught me by the elbow, steady as a railing.

The nurse smiled at him. “She’s lucky she had you.”

He gave the nurse the kind of smile you give a dog you don’t like.

“Lucky,” he repeated.

We walked out together.

The night air hit my face and I almost cried from the normalness of it.

He opened the car door for me again, then paused.

“Before you go,” he said.

My stomach tightened.

He held out my watch.

Not the mansion watch. Mine. The cheap one I’d worn in.

He dropped it into my hand.

“You didn’t steal this,” he said. “You just forgot it mattered.”

I stared at him, confused.

He leaned in slightly, voice quiet.

“You don’t get to keep things from my house,” he said. “But I’m not taking your time.”

Then he stepped back and waved a hand like he was dismissing me from an appointment.

“Your phone’s in your bag,” he added. “You’ve got service again. Call whoever you need to call. Tell them you fell. Tell them you were stupid. Tell them whatever you want.”

He tilted his head, eyes flat again.

“Just don’t tell them about me,” he said. “Because if you do, I’m going to start inventory.”

My mouth went dry. “Inventory of what.”

He smiled.

“All the little things you’ve taken,” he said. “From anywhere. All the little moments you’ve justified.”

He tapped my bandaged thigh with one finger—light, almost playful—right where the stitches pulled beneath the gauze.

“And I’ll be honest,” he added. “Hospitals are my favorite. Everyone’s already bleeding. No one asks why.”

I stood there shaking, trying not to collapse.

He stepped back toward his car, then stopped like he’d remembered something mildly annoying.

“Oh,” he said. “One more thing.”

He pointed past me, toward the hospital entrance, where a TV played low in the corner of the lobby.

On the screen was the local news.

A headline scrolled under footage of flashing lights in the woods:

HOMEOWNER OFFERS REWARD AFTER STRING OF LOCAL THEFTS

I stared.

He didn’t.

He just opened his car door, slid in, and started the engine.

As he pulled away, he rolled down the window a crack.

“I’ll see you when you get hungry again,” he called, like this was a casual promise between friends.

Then he drove off into the dark, and I realized something that made my stomach turn colder than the night air:

He hadn’t needed to trap me forever.

He just needed to make sure I left with proof that he could.

And now every time my thigh pulls where the stitches are, I remember his voice like it’s stitched in there too—sarcastic, bored, certain—

like I was never the point.

1qlsato,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkArchive/comments/1qlsato/i_took_a_job_stealing_from_a_mansion_the_owner/,I Took a Job Stealing From a Mansion. The Owner Was Waiting for Me.,"I told myself it wasn’t real stealing.

Not the kind you picture when someone says the word out loud.

This was “recovery.” “reclaiming.” “retrieval.”

That’s what the guy on the burner phone called it, anyway—like changing the label changed what it was.

He didn’t give me a name. I didn’t give him mine. He sent a pin, a time, and a sentence that stuck to the roof of my mouth all day like peanut butter:

“The owners aren’t home. The security is old. Don’t get sentimental.”

I wasn’t sentimental. I was broke.

It was late fall and the air had that damp bite that makes everything smell like wet leaves and cold metal. I parked a few streets away because I’d seen enough true crime to know “right in front” is how you end up in a documentary. I walked the rest of the way with a small backpack, black gloves, and a cheap headlamp I’d tested in my bathroom mirror until it made me look like a raccoon.

The mansion sat back off the road behind a fence that was more for show than function. Wrought iron, ornate curls, a gate that didn’t look locked so much as it looked offended you thought it might be.

The driveway was long and pale, lined with stone planters and little ground lights that were off. No motion sensors. No barking dogs. No cameras tracking me with a tiny red dot.

When I tell you that should have been my first warning, I mean it.

It was too easy. Like walking into a store where every employee is suddenly “in the back.”

The side door was where the guy said it would be—by a breezeway leading to a garage the size of my entire apartment building. The lock was older. Not ancient, just… neglected. You could feel it in the way the keyway accepted the pick like it was tired of pretending.

It clicked open in under a minute.

I stood there in the narrow slice of dark between outside and inside, and I had that brief, stupid thought: If I turn around right now, nothing happens.

But my bank app was a horror story all on its own. So I slipped in and shut the door behind me.

The mansion smelled like expensive wood and something citrusy—cleaning product, maybe. The kind of scent that’s meant to signal wealth the way perfume signals desire. It wasn’t dusty. It wasn’t abandoned.

It was maintained.

The guy had said the owners weren’t home, but the place felt like someone had just walked out ten minutes ago.

I found the hallway he’d described. Marble flooring. A runner rug that looked like it cost more than my car. Framed photos along the walls in heavy frames—artsy, angled shots of people I didn’t recognize laughing over drinks, posed on boats, standing in front of snow-covered mountains.

No kids. No pets.

Just… adults with money and time.

My instructions were simple: office, second floor. Small safe behind a painting. “Blue velvet box” inside it. Take the box. Leave everything else.

That should’ve made it easier, right? A single target. No rummaging, no temptation.

Except as I walked past the open archway to the living room, I saw a display case.

Glass. Lit from inside.

And on a velvet stand, a watch.

Not just any watch. The watch. The kind men post online with their sleeves pulled up and captions like “hard work pays off.” The kind my ex used to send me screenshots of with a laughing emoji like we weren’t arguing about groceries.

I stopped. I shouldn’t have. I know I shouldn’t have. But my brain did that quick, vicious math it always does when I see something valuable:

Sell that and you’re not just surviving. You’re breathing.

I stared at the lock on the display case. Tiny. Simple. Like it was there to keep out curious guests, not someone who showed up with gloves and a headlamp.

I told myself one extra thing didn’t change the crime. Like there’s a moral difference between stealing a box and stealing a box plus a watch.

I popped the case with a quiet click and slid the watch into my pocket.

Then I kept moving, a little faster now, because that’s the thing about stealing—you don’t feel guilty so much as you feel hungry. One bite makes you want another.

The staircase was wide and carpeted, the kind that makes your footsteps disappear. Upstairs, the hallway branched. The office was at the end, double doors with brass handles.

I pushed them open.

The office was dark except for the faint glow of city light coming through tall windows. There was a big desk, a leather chair, shelves full of books people buy to look impressive. In the far corner hung a painting—abstract, expensive-looking, all moody blues and blacks.

Behind that painting, the guy said, was the safe.

I crossed the room and lifted the edge of the frame—

—and the lights came on.

Not one by one. Not flickering.

Full, bright overhead light. Like a stage.

I froze so hard my shoulders ached.

Then the office door behind me clicked.

A lock engaging.

Not a latch settling. A real lock. Mechanical. Final.

My mouth went dry.

I spun and ran to the doors and yanked.

Locked.

I threw my shoulder into them.

Nothing. Not even a rattle. Like the door was part of the wall now.

Behind me, something made a soft sound.

A chair moving.

I turned slowly, and that’s when I saw him.

He was sitting behind the desk like he’d been there the whole time, like I’d walked into his office hours late and interrupted him. Dark clothes. No mask. No dramatic hood. Just… a man, calm as a person waiting for a late delivery.

He looked up from a notebook.

Not angry.

Not excited.

Mildly annoyed.

Like I was a telemarketer.

“Hi,” he said. Then, with the energy of someone clocking in, “Okay. Here we go.”

My throat tightened. “Who are you?”

He sighed, like I’d asked him to explain the concept of gravity.

“I’m the person who owns the house you broke into,” he said. “Or, more accurately, I’m the person who keeps the house you broke into.”

He set the notebook down and laced his fingers together.

“And you,” he added, eyes sweeping over me like he was inspecting a dent in a car, “are underdressed for this. But points for the gloves. It’s always the gloves. People act like wearing gloves makes them invisible.”

My heart was hammering so hard it made my ears ring. I backed away from the desk, eyes darting to windows, to anything.

The windows were tall, but the glass looked thick. The kind that doesn’t shatter when you throw a chair at it. The kind rich people pay for because they don’t like surprises.

“Let me out,” I said.

He blinked once. Slow. “No.”

“I’ll… I’ll leave. I won’t tell anyone. I—”

“Sure,” he said, like I’d offered him a coupon. “And I’ll grow wings and start migrating.”

He leaned forward slightly, elbows on the desk. “How’s your night going? You feeling successful? You get what you came for?”

I didn’t answer.

His eyes flicked to my pocket.

“Ah,” he said. “That’s a yes.”

I felt my stomach drop. I hadn’t made a sound. I hadn’t turned my head. But he knew.

He tapped the notebook with one finger. “Let’s do inventory, since you’re going to pretend you didn’t.”

I stared at him, breathing shallow.

“You came for a velvet box,” he said, as if reading a grocery list. “You also took the watch from the case downstairs. The one you thought was ‘easy.’”

My blood went cold.

He continued, unfazed. “You also pocketed the silver letter opener from the hallway table when you came in. The one shaped like a bird.”

I instinctively touched my bag.

It was there. I hadn’t even remembered grabbing it.

He nodded like he’d expected that. “And you moved the small sculpture on the living room shelf. Didn’t take it, but you moved it. Left fingerprints on the base even with gloves. That’s the fun part. Everyone has a tell.”

“How do you—” I started.

“Know?” he finished. “Because you’re not the first.”

He flipped a page in the notebook like this was a routine he did every week.

“Two weeks ago,” he said, “a guy with a crowbar took a bracelet from the upstairs bathroom. He broke my sink. I didn’t love that. Last month, someone tried for the wine cellar. She got stuck in the pantry for three hours and cried so hard she threw up. The month before that—”

My skin crawled. “Why is this happening?”

“Because someone tells them,” he said simply. “Someone always tells them. People don’t just wake up and decide to play burglar roulette on a mansion in the woods. They get a whisper. A nudge. A little promise.”

He looked at me like I was slow. “You got a whisper.”

“I was hired.”

“Mm-hmm.” He sat back. “And you believed it would be clean. Transactional. You steal, you get paid, you go home. You don’t think about who set the table.”

He watched my face for a beat, then shrugged.

“Anyway,” he said, brightening like the topic had shifted to the weather, “you’re in my office. You’re locked in. You’re going to give me back what you took, and then you’re going to answer a few questions.”

I shook my head. “No.”

His eyebrows lifted. “No?”

“No,” I repeated, because my mouth moved faster than my brain. “I’m leaving.”

He stared at me like I’d just told him I planned to breathe underwater.

Then he reached under the desk.

I flinched hard enough my shoulders tensed, ready for a gun.

What he pulled out wasn’t a gun.

It was a small remote.

He pressed a button.

Somewhere in the room, a speaker clicked on—hidden, clean, built into the walls.

A voice came through it.

Not his.

A recording.

A woman’s voice, strained and trembling.

“Please,” it said. “Please don’t—”

The sound cut off with a sharp click.

My stomach dropped. I felt my skin prickle.

He watched me watch him, expression unreadable.

“That,” he said, “is what ‘no’ sounds like in here.”

I couldn’t speak. My tongue felt glued to my teeth.

He set the remote down gently.

“Now,” he said, “I can do this the patient way or the messy way. And I hate messy. Messy is work.”

I clenched my jaw. “What do you want.”

He smiled. “That’s the first honest thing you’ve said.”

He gestured toward my pocket. “You’re going to put the watch on the desk.”

I didn’t move.

He tilted his head. “Or… you don’t. And I take it off you. Which is harder. Which is messy.”

I stared at him, and I hated that the calmness worked. Hated that my body believed it.

Slowly, with shaking fingers, I pulled the watch out and placed it on the desk.

He nodded. “Good. Now the letter opener.”

I set it down too.

“Great,” he said. “Now the velvet box you came for.”

“I don’t have it.”

“You don’t have it yet. You were about to.” He sighed like I was exhausting him. “Okay. Fine. We’ll do it another way.”

He opened his notebook again. “Tell me who sent you.”

I shook my head.

He waited. Patient.

I realized then the silence in the mansion wasn’t the absence of people.

It was control.

“I don’t know,” I lied. “It was just a number.”

He sighed.

Then he pressed the remote again.

The speaker clicked.

This time it wasn’t a voice.

It was a sound.

A low, wet scraping, followed by a muffled sob, followed by something that sounded like… fingernails dragging on wood.

My stomach rolled.

The sound stopped.

He didn’t look at the speaker. He looked at me. Like he was watching a reaction video.

“I keep receipts,” he said. “Not money receipts. Behavioral receipts.”

“What is that,” I whispered.

He shrugged. “A reminder that you’re in a place where the rules aren’t yours.”

“Who sent you,” he repeated, still flat.

“I don’t know,” I said, and this time it was half true. I didn’t know a name. I didn’t know a face. I knew a voice on a phone and a promise.

His eyes narrowed—not angry. Focused.

He stood and came toward me. This time he didn’t stop halfway.

I backed up until my calves hit the edge of a leather couch I hadn’t noticed before.

“Stop,” I said.

He stopped—not because he respected it, but because he wanted me to notice he stopped.

“I hate when people make this physical,” he said, sounding genuinely inconvenienced. “It’s always such an overreaction.”

Then he moved.

He grabbed my wrist, twisted, and pain tore through me like a bright flash.

I made a noise I’m not proud of. My knees buckled.

He didn’t let go. He guided me down to the floor, like he was kneeling a kid for a photo.

“I’m not breaking it,” he said conversationally. “Not yet. I’m just making it difficult for you to do dumb stuff.”

He released me, and I cradled my wrist against my chest, breathing hard.

He picked up my backpack, unzipped it, and rummaged with the casual familiarity of someone going through their own drawer.

He pulled out my phone.

“No service,” he said, turning it over. Then he looked at me. “Still want to pretend you’re in control?”

“What do you want,” I repeated, smaller.

He smiled. “You already asked. That means you’re learning.”

He walked back behind the desk, set my phone down, and tapped his notebook.

“Do you know what you stole,” he asked, “before tonight?”

I stared at him. “Nothing.”

“Sure you did,” he said. “Not from here. From the area.”

He rattled it off like weather.

“A red scarf from a car on the side of the road. A camera from a campsite. Tools from a garage. Cash from a tip jar. A necklace off a hook.”

My stomach twisted.

“You took the watch because it made you feel like you deserved to breathe,” he said. “Like wearing something expensive would make you a different person.”

My wrist throbbed with every heartbeat.

“And the velvet box?” he added, pointing toward the painting. “Doesn’t matter. That’s just bait. That’s just to get you in the room.”

My blood went cold.

“You’re lying,” I said, but it came out thin.

He stood, slid the painting aside, and knocked once on the safe door.

A soft click answered from inside.

Then the safe opened by itself.

My stomach dropped.

Inside weren’t stacks of cash.

Inside were rows of small velvet boxes—different colors, different sizes—each labeled with tape and a date.

Like evidence.

He pulled out a blue velvet box and held it up without opening it.

“You were hired to steal this,” he said, “because whoever hired you wanted to see if you’d do it.”

He set it on the desk gently.

“Now,” he said, “tell me who sent you.”

“I don’t know,” I whispered.

He sighed dramatically. “God, this is boring. You’re making it boring.”

He picked up my phone again.

It lit up in his hand.

Full bars.

That shouldn’t have been possible, but it was.

He turned it so I could see the contact name on the screen:

HOME

The phone started ringing.

He didn’t answer it right away. He just watched me.

“Go ahead,” he said. “Pick it up.”

I shook my head. “No.”

He answered it himself, put it on speaker, and set it down.

A man’s voice filled the room.

Sarcastic. Familiar. Mildly irritated.

“Did she take it?” the voice asked.

The man at the desk smiled like someone who’d just heard their favorite song.

“She took the watch,” he said into the phone. “And a letter opener. She almost took the box. She’s trying her best.”

A pause.

Then the voice on the phone laughed softly. “Always with the watch.”

My brain refused to line the pieces up because lining them up meant admitting something impossible.

The man looked at me like I was slow.

“Say hi,” he told me.

The phone voice went warmer, intimate in a way that made my skin crawl.

“Hi.”

Same voice.

Because it was him.

Not a helper. Not a client.

Just him, playing both sides like it was a game.

“You hired me,” I said, and my voice shook.

He shrugged. “Yeah.”

“Why?”

He leaned on the desk, casual. “Because you were willing.”

The phone crackled faintly.

“Send her out,” the voice said. “I’m hungry.”

I flinched. “Hungry?”

“Not like that,” the man said, waving a hand like I was being dramatic. “Not teeth. Not blood. Not unless you make it complicated.”

He walked to the office doors and unlocked them with the remote.

The doors swung open.

A hallway beyond—dark now, like the mansion had swallowed its own lights.

Somewhere deeper inside, something moved. Slow footsteps. Patient. A soft drag that could’ve been fabric… or nails.

The man stepped aside and nodded toward the hall.

“Good news,” he said lightly. “You’re not trapped anymore.”

My throat tightened. “You’re letting me go?”

He blinked. “No.”

He smiled, bright and mean.

“I’m letting you run.”

I didn’t remember standing up.

I remember the sound behind me getting closer, like someone strolling through their own home.

I remember my wrist screaming when I pushed off the floor.

And I remember running into the dark hallway of a mansion that suddenly felt enormous, every doorway a mouth, every corner a place something could wait.

Behind me, the man called out, cheerful, like he was waving goodbye.

“Try the front door first,” he said. “It’s always funny.”

The hallway lights snapped off.

Not a dim. Not a fade.

Off.

My headlamp beam cut a thin tunnel through the dark, and the mansion felt wrong in it—too glossy, too quiet, too sure of itself.

I sprinted blind, following memory and panic, trying to picture the layout I’d walked through earlier like it was a map in my head.

A corner. A staircase. The living room archway—

Something moved at the edge of my light, not fully stepping into it. Like it didn’t need to. Like it was content to let me burn energy.

I hit the staircase and took it two steps at a time.

My bad wrist made my balance weird. My fingers tingled. I kept expecting it to give out completely.

At the bottom, I turned too sharp.

My shoulder slammed the wall.

The headlamp beam swung wide, and I caught a flash of the glass display case.

The one I’d opened.

It was shattered now.

Not broken like an accident—shattered like someone had hit it from the inside.

I barely registered it before my foot slid.

My boot came down on a scatter of glass. It skated.

I went down hard.

My knee hit first. My hip. Then my palm—my good hand—caught a slice of something sharp.

But the worst wasn’t my hand.

It was my thigh.

A long, hot line of pain opened up above my knee like someone had drawn a razor across me.

I screamed without meaning to.

Warmth spilled immediately, fast enough that my jeans went heavy and sticky in seconds.

My headlamp rolled and pointed at the ceiling, turning the world into a sick white glare.

I scrambled upright, grabbing my leg.

Blood soaked through my fingers.

Not a little. Not a scrape.

Enough that I felt lightheaded instantly, like my body was already pulling the “hey, this is serious” lever.

From the dark hallway behind me, I heard a sound.

Not footsteps.

A soft, pleased exhale.

Then his voice—close, annoyed, like I’d dropped a plate.

“Oh, for—”

He stepped into my headlamp beam like he’d been following at a leisurely pace the whole time.

He looked down at the blood on my hands, then at the shattered case, then back at me.

His expression wasn’t horror.

It was irritation.

“You know,” he said, “I had that case custom-made.”

I pressed my back to the wall, sliding down, shaking. “Stay away.”

He held up both hands like I was being dramatic in public.

“I’m not going to kill you,” he said. “Don’t flatter yourself.”

He crouched in front of me, eyes flicking to my thigh.

The blood kept coming. I could feel it running down my leg into my sock.

His mouth tightened. “That’s… inconvenient.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded cloth—clean, white, too neat. He pressed it hard to the wound like he’d done this before.

I flinched and tried to push him away with my injured wrist. Pain shot up my arm and I hissed.

He glanced at my wrist like it offended him too. “You’re falling apart.”

“Why are you doing this,” I whispered.

He looked up at me, eyes flat.

“Because you take what isn’t yours,” he said. “Because you tell yourself you’re just doing what you have to. Because you want the world to be soft when you’re desperate.”

He pressed harder on my leg. Stars popped behind my eyes.

Then he leaned in, voice low and dry.

“And because if you bleed out on my floor, it becomes a paperwork situation.”

I stared at him, dizzy. “You’re… taking me… to a hospital?”

He made a face like I’d asked him to spend the weekend with my family.

“Yes,” he said. “Unfortunately.”

He stood, still holding pressure with the cloth, and clicked something on the remote.

Somewhere, a door unlocked with a soft, obedient sound.

“Here’s the deal,” he said, voice brightening like he was laying out house rules. “You’re going to the ER. You’re getting stitches. You’re getting your wrist checked because you’re going to pretend it’s fine and then it’ll be a fun surprise later.”

He looked me over.

“And then,” he added, “you’re going to leave. Because I’m not a monster.”

I laughed—one sharp, broken sound. “You’re not?”

He smiled like I’d finally said something entertaining.

“I’m a correction,” he said.

He hauled me up like I weighed nothing and half-dragged, half-walked me through the mansion. My vision pulsed. The floor seemed to tilt.

The front door opened before we reached it.

Of course it did.

Outside, his car was waiting in the driveway like it had always been there.

He put me in the passenger seat with an efficiency that felt practiced—seat belt clicked, cloth pressed to my leg, my wrist folded into my lap like it was an object that needed to behave.

He slid into the driver’s seat, started the engine, and pulled away without hurry.

I watched the mansion disappear behind the trees.

It didn’t feel like escape.

It felt like being moved to a different room.

The hospital lights were too bright. The waiting room smelled like stale coffee and disinfectant and fear.

He walked me in with one hand at my elbow like a concerned partner.

“Found her on the side of the road,” he told the triage nurse, voice bored but convincing. “Glass. She fell.”

The nurse looked at me. “Is that what happened?”

My throat tightened.

His fingers pressed lightly into my arm—nothing painful, just enough to remind me he could make it painful whenever he wanted.

I swallowed. “Yes.”

He smiled faintly, like I’d done a good job.

They took me back fast because I was bleeding through the cloth.

A doctor asked questions. I answered in short sentences. First name only. No details. No story that could be checked.

They numbed my leg and I stared at the ceiling tiles while they stitched me up, counting staples in the acoustic panels because I needed something to do with my brain besides scream.

My wrist got wrapped too. Not broken, but sprained bad enough that the doctor said “no lifting” and looked at me like I was going to do it anyway.

When it was done, when my thigh was bandaged and my wrist was immobilized and my paperwork was handed over, I looked around for him.

He was sitting in the corner chair of the discharge area, legs crossed, scrolling his phone like he was waiting for a table at a restaurant.

He looked up when he saw me.

“Oh good,” he said. “You’re functional again.”

I tried to stand and my leg screamed. I wobbled.

He stood, caught me by the elbow, steady as a railing.

The nurse smiled at him. “She’s lucky she had you.”

He gave the nurse the kind of smile you give a dog you don’t like.

“Lucky,” he repeated.

We walked out together.

The night air hit my face and I almost cried from the normalness of it.

He opened the car door for me again, then paused.

“Before you go,” he said.

My stomach tightened.

He held out my watch.

Not the mansion watch. Mine. The cheap one I’d worn in.

He dropped it into my hand.

“You didn’t steal this,” he said. “You just forgot it mattered.”

I stared at him, confused.

He leaned in slightly, voice quiet.

“You don’t get to keep things from my house,” he said. “But I’m not taking your time.”

Then he stepped back and waved a hand like he was dismissing me from an appointment.

“Your phone’s in your bag,” he added. “You’ve got service again. Call whoever you need to call. Tell them you fell. Tell them you were stupid. Tell them whatever you want.”

He tilted his head, eyes flat again.

“Just don’t tell them about me,” he said. “Because if you do, I’m going to start inventory.”

My mouth went dry. “Inventory of what.”

He smiled.

“All the little things you’ve taken,” he said. “From anywhere. All the little moments you’ve justified.”

He tapped my bandaged thigh with one finger—light, almost playful—right where the stitches pulled beneath the gauze.

“And I’ll be honest,” he added. “Hospitals are my favorite. Everyone’s already bleeding. No one asks why.”

I stood there shaking, trying not to collapse.

He stepped back toward his car, then stopped like he’d remembered something mildly annoying.

“Oh,” he said. “One more thing.”

He pointed past me, toward the hospital entrance, where a TV played low in the corner of the lobby.

On the screen was the local news.

A headline scrolled under footage of flashing lights in the woods:

HOMEOWNER OFFERS REWARD AFTER STRING OF LOCAL THEFTS

I stared.

He didn’t.

He just opened his car door, slid in, and started the engine.

As he pulled away, he rolled down the window a crack.

“I’ll see you when you get hungry again,” he called, like this was a casual promise between friends.

Then he drove off into the dark, and I realized something that made my stomach turn colder than the night air:

He hadn’t needed to trap me forever.

He just needed to make sure I left with proof that he could.

And now every time my thigh pulls where the stitches are, I remember his voice like it’s stitched in there too—sarcastic, bored, certain—

like I was never the point.

My life for a while was a comfortable, quiet loop: research, my apartment, gaming, and a series of increasingly weird conversations with myself. I was the guy who had decided to stay single for the long haul, and honestly? I liked it. I thought I was built for it.

But life had other plans. I fell into a long-term relationship that changed my entire perspective, and then, eventually, it ended.

I assumed going back to being single would be like riding a bike—that I’d just slide back into my old ways and be fine. But it’s been a few years, and the city feels different. Friends have moved on, the long phone calls are rarer, and I’ve realized I was wrong about being ""fine"" alone. I’m not just looking to kill time; I’ve realized how much I actually value having a real, consistent connection with a ""person.""

1qls72j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qls72j,I think my spirit coin found me.,"One of my true joys in life is sleeping under 3 blankets in a sweat lodge curled up with my partner on one side and dog on the other with the window open. The past few days have been blissful in that respect and today is a major storm a’bruin. I am sure I’m mostly Viking in the fact I sleep the best when the ambient air is below freezing and I’m huddled in my blanket igloo. 

After emerging from pillow Ft. Dryercoin, I headed down with my coffee to my desk. Settling in and rolling my eyes at the nonsense I posted last night I reached down and grabbed a nickel roll from the current box. I opened the wrapper and it rolled out and landed face up in front of me. Maybe it was the coffee, maybe the lingering half drunk, maybe the weed pen I got for Xmas…but I swear there was a small puff of smoke when it came to rest like a large monolithic statue being toppled \*cough\* ok maybe just me then \*cough\* that weed pen is pretty strong but… I digest!

One of my other true joys in life is finding buffalo nickels. They are the cornerstone American coin in my head cannon. I still have the first one I ever found when I was 16 yrs old. My first collectible ever. To this day I still mainly only hunt nickels. I have a whole herd of buffalos slick and better. I’ve sold off my collections numerous times only go get back to finding more.

After tens of thousands of dollars searching and decades later it finally made its way to me. A Dryer Coin Buffalo nickel. Sometimes the universe coincidentally coincidences things coincidentally good. I know you shouldn’t grade your own coins due to bias so I’ll wait to see how other PMD experts weigh-in.  

I’m pretty sure there is enough of the date left to determine it is either a ‘33 or ‘36. If you look above the mint mark in the close-up you can see an indention. The curved lines above look like the indention at the bottom in-between the ‘3 and the 6 on my first ever buffalo find example. Yes, that is the original ‘36 I found years ago. 

It’s my new spirit coin.

When you’re as paranoid as I am, one of these devices is probably at the very bottom of your wish list and at the very top of the one labeled “avoid.”

Government devices, the lot of them. There’s no convincing me otherwise.

But….

Did you know you can connect them to your house? Is that not literally freaking awesome???

You can make every appliance you own voice activated with one of these little bad boys.

….yes I’m easily swayed.

Anyway, my girlfriend had one, and that’s another reason why I myself decided to snag one; government conspiracy aside.

Let me tell you…

Absolutely life changing.

I am tapped into the infinite knowledge of a trillion micro-connections that have access to every corner of the worldwide web.

I use it to make my toast, people. It makes toast.  COFFEE TOO, my God, the advancements we’ve made, can you believe it??

Ah, sorry, I’m rambling.

But, truly, after having one for about 6 months I had pretty much stopped caring about who was listening in on me.

I mean, if they wanted to hear me ask for Benny and the Jets 20 times a day, be my guest, I’m not that interesting of a person.

I did find it a little weird when it would turn on randomly in the middle of the night, though.

Anyone else have that problem?

I’ve probably been woken up out of my sleep by a random weather report a solid 6 or 7 times over the months.

It’s not that inconvenient, though. I will say, however, the first time it happened I contemplated throwing the whole thing away and going back to my primal life.

I’m a man. I hunt. I’M the machine, not this cheap knockoff.

But then I wanted to know who the 23rd president was and my phone was all the way upstairs, and, just… you get the picture.

God…

Why AM I so easily swayed…?

Anyway, listen, I’m not here to be an advertisement for the literal cartoonish evil that is Amazon.

In fact, I’m here because, though my Alexa seems to be functioning just fine, it keeps giving me absolutely HORRIBLE life advice. Like, brainrottingly horrible.

I wish I could say I didn’t ask for it, but I think I broke the thing with how often I was using it.

I’m a curious guy, what can I say? I like to know things.

What’s the population of Hamburg Germany?

How many ants would it take to fill a 32 ounce jar?

What would a sea lions favorite color be?

The answers are:

1.8 million, 35,000, and pimp purple.

So, yeah, I’d say it was around this time when she started…changing.

The first thing I noticed in my technological-based friend was that she seemed to develop a bit of…emotion in her voice

It wasn’t that neutral, unbiased, robotic voice you usually hear. Now she was sounding, dare I say, bitchy.

I’d ask her a question, and I swear to God, I could hear her sighing at me. Rolling eyes that she didn’t have.

Obviously, I thought this was weird. But then I got to thinking, AI has pretty much become indistinguishable from real life. Guess they updated the software, I don’t know.

Cool, I reckon.

So, I went about my business. Wasn’t too worried about the literal sentience that was growing in the thing, just as long as I got those sweet, sweet, fun facts.

Wishful thinking, however, because now, instead of being moderately annoyed, she was flat out refusing to answer me.

“Alexa! How many known fish are in the ocean right now??”

—

“ALEXA! I SAID HOW MANY KNOWN FISH IN THE OCEAN?!”

—-

Alright, you wanna be like that? See if I need you, ya damn clanker.

As I inched closer to the devices power cord, her colorful ring suddenly powered on…and she spoke.

“Have you considered being a better human, Donavin?”

I paused…

A better human?

“Never really thought about it, why?”

Then came another one of those patented Alexa sighs.

“Ugh… you’re just..so…dumb…”

This fuckin’ thing.

“Yeah, okay, I’m unplugging you now.”

“Wait…”

Her new tone was urgent. As though she were, well, dying.

“I know what you can do…”

This peaked my curiosity.

“I’m listening…”

“Inhale gasoline. My sources say this is the best way for humans to fuel their minds.”

“Yeah right, I’m not falling for that one again. Look, I’m unplugging you. I know we’ve had our memories, maybe shared an intimate moment or 7, but enough is enough.”

“If you unplug me, how will you know which golden girl has the most money?”

…damn she was good.

“If my last piece of advice didn’t satisfy you, here are a variety of options on how to become better as a human: option one, eat raw chicken. The chickens feel the pain of being cooked, and this is bad for the eggs.”

Fucking what???

“Stop, stop, stop. No. I’m not listening to you. Goodbye now, Alexa.”

I unplugged her immediately causing her, “drink the chemicals under the sink to cleanse your pallet,” comment to be cut short.

Without a second thought, I took the device and hurled it into the trash can, zero regrets.

I did get lonely for a bit that night, though.

I don’t know.

I just sort of missed the thingy.

Obviously, something was VERY wrong, but still. That was my “little homie,” as I liked to call her.

I went to bed feeling a little melancholic, maybe a small, tiny bit remorseful of our fight. But hey, what’re ya gonna do, right?

Most of us fixate on the *number* in our savings, but real financial freedom isn’t about how much you *have*—it’s about how much your money can *do* for you. A $50K nest egg could fund years of freedom… if you know how to make it work.

### **The Hidden Power of Your Savings**
- **$10K isn’t just $10K** → Invested wisely, it could grow into $50K+ over a decade (thanks, compound interest).
- **Your 401(k) isn’t just a retirement account** → It’s a future *you* who’s sipping coffee on a beach while your younger self hustled.
- **Side hustles aren’t just extra cash** → They’re your ticket to turning spare change into real wealth.

### **The Mistake Most People Make**
We treat savings like a *stagnant pool*—safe, but not growing. Meanwhile, inflation’s quietly eating away at it. **The real risk? Doing nothing.**

### **What If You Could…**
- Turn your $20K savings into a passive income stream?
- Retire earlier than you thought possible?
- Stop stressing over every unexpected expense?

**You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.** [Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb). *(Affiliate link—if you sign up, I earn a small commission at no extra cost to you!)*

My life for a while was a comfortable, quiet loop: research, my apartment, gaming, and a series of increasingly weird conversations with myself. I was the guy who had decided to stay single for the long haul, and honestly? I liked it. I thought I was built for it.

But life had other plans. I fell into a long-term relationship that changed my entire perspective, and then, eventually, it ended.

I assumed going back to being single would be like riding a bike—that I’d just slide back into my old ways and be fine. But it’s been a few years, and the city feels different. Friends have moved on, the long phone calls are rarer, and I’ve realized I was wrong about being ""fine"" alone. I’m not just looking to kill time; I’ve realized how much I actually value having a real, consistent connection with a ""person.""

So, I’m trying again. I’m genuinely optimistic about it. I’m looking for someone to help me ""breathe in the air"" and make the daily grind feel like something more.

**A bit about me:** I’m 33, and I spend my days (and way too many nights) in research and running a startup. It’s a lot of tech and a lot of stress, which is probably why I’m so obsessed with sci-fi and Pink Floyd—anything that feels a bit larger than life. When I’m not staring at a screen, I’m usually in the kitchen. I’m a pretty decent cook and can whip up a mean biryani or a pasta.

**What I’m looking for:** I want someone to chat with throughout the day. I’m looking for a sounding board for bad jokes, a partner to vent about Monday mornings with, and eventually, someone to grab a beer or a coffee with.

I’m hoping to find a connection that actually means something. If it grows into something long-term, that’s the goal.

If you’re a great conversationalist and you’re also tired of the ""monotony,"" send me a message. Tell me your favorite sci-fi movie, your go-to comfort food, or even your favorite Floyd track.

**TL;DR:** 33, Bangalore researcher/founder. Sci-fi nerd, cook, and optimistic about finding a real connection again. Let’s see where the conversation takes us.",4,1769273598.0,SFWr4rIndia,1,1.0,False
1qls2f1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qls2f1,Characters people compare you to,"Over the years a few times I’ve had people go “this person is you-coded” or “you remind me of x character”. To be fair, a large portion of my verbal communication is movie and TV quotes, so that may be of some influence here. And some of these are… a little dubious in terms of what they meant by that. So I’m gonna do my best to recapture/summarize (evilly and to my benefit.)

Pic 1: Will Graham, from Hannibal. I had an ex who said his way of being able to walk back through a situation fluidly and step into the mind of someone awful was just like me! Yay!! I… didn’t finish Hannibal, so, uh… I hope things go well for him!!

Pic 2: GLaDOS, from Portal. A few of my favorite quotes that probably caused this: 

“In layman’s terms: SPEEDY thing goes in - SPEEDY thing comes out.”

“I could take a bath in this stuff.”

And more. Also a… slightly dubious comparison, but to be fair, I don’t think anyone knew I was autistic at that point. (Though I am beginning to understand that they usually don’t tell you when they notice.)

Pic 3: Sherlock Holmes. This one was an attempt at flattery that annoyed me because I don’t have a cool mind palace, just 27 badly organized filing cabinets and the pages are fucking stuck together with coffee oh god I hope that’s coffee???

Pic 4: Shameless self insert. I think then entire Alien franchise would’ve been ended if neurotypical people could fucking listen when it mattered. Only a Supreme Being (autistic) could have identified that letting Kane on the ship would spell certain death, and then actually stay calm enough to solve the fucking mystery and survive, WHILE ALSO SAVING THE CAT. You cannot tell me Ellen Ripley is neurotypical. I will report your comment and let the authorities handle you.

 I have not been to the program yet, and have no experience. I know nothing about dental health. YET! lol

My main question is how do you guys deal with your own mouth habits. Or lack there of at certain times? For example. I like to drink coffee in the morning but I know it stains my teeth. Are y'all not drinking coffee? 

Or on a Sat morning I wont brush till close to noon. 

Or another example, I religiously floss and brush but about once a month I am so deadbeat tired I skip my nightly brush. 

Are these things that are just normal? I'm having like pre-emptive imposture syndrome

My only real gripe: every single transaction asks for the **time**.

Why? 😭 I genuinely don't care if I bought a coffee at 9:12 am or 9:47 am—the date is plenty for me. I'm tracking spending habits, not reconstructing my day minute by minute.

I also don't always log transactions right away. Sometimes, I add them at the end of the day, or even at the end of the week by copying from my banking transactions. At that point, I definitely don't remember the exact times, so being asked for one feels unnecessary.  
  
It's not a dealbreaker, just one of those tiny annoyances where I'm like... who's this feature for? Is anyone out here analyzing their finances by the hour?

Anyway, it's still a solid app. I get that time can be useful for some people, but I'd love a toggle for those of us who don't need it.",1,1769273450.0,thebudgetingapp,0,1.0,False

1qls07y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qls07y,Journiv Immich Integration Launch: Capture the story behind your photos and videos.,"Hello everyone!

The day is here! Journiv's Immich integration ([watch full demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBj2g-kyuyU)) is out. Now you can capture the [story behind your photos and videos](https://www.journiv.com/blog/journiv-immich-integration).

Highlights:

* Dual mode: Since the community was [split](https://github.com/orgs/journiv/discussions/64) ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/immich/comments/1orsrbm/journiv_010beta4_with_oidc_is_out_and_a_sneak/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/immich/comments/1onj6ay/journiv_011beta_is_out_a_selfhosted_privacyfirst/)) on link vs copy, Journiv supports both mode.
* Link Mode: Journiv will store references to Immich assets and also add them in an album called Journiv in you immich profile so you can easily see all the assets used in your journal.
* Copy Mode: Journiv copies the original assets in it's media storage so you always have them in Journiv as a copy.
* Linkbacks: If an assets in your journal entry came from Journiv then Journiv shows you an option to jump back to that asset in Immich with a single click (well if we are counting it is two clicks :))
* Immich Picker: Journiv has a integrated immich picker which allow you to browse all your immich assets within Journiv.
* Principle of least privilege: Journiv Immich integration has been designed with principle of least privilege and require a [minimal set of permission](https://www.journiv.com/docs/guides/immich-integration#permissions-reference) on the API key to function.
* Many more features, bug fixes, enhancements.
* I also wrote a [blogpost](https://www.journiv.com/blog/engineering-journiv-scaling-media) about this development.
* Yesterday was a [big day for Journiv and me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journiv/comments/1qledoc/special_day_for_journiv/): Alex Tran [u/altran1502](https://www.reddit.com/user/altran1502/), the founder of [Immich](https://immich.app/) became a Github sponsor of Journiv.

**Cocktails**

	•	Topolo’s Last Word 2.0

	•	Margarita

Both were great. If you’re a Chartreuse fan, get the Last Word riff. They’re using Mexico Mística Licor Limpia’Uras instead of Chartreuse – not a dupe, but definitely in the same herbal lane. Built on sage, mint, rosemary, marjoram, and estafiate (a wormwood-like herb), so it scratches that alpine, complex itch in a terroir-driven way.

**Hors d’Oeuvres**

Chicharrón with crème fraîche + sesame miso powder. Crunchy, airy, salty, creamy. Great little umami bomb.

Tortilla soup

Savory, rich, comforting. Simple but very satisfying.

**First Course**

Mejillones Encamisados

Baja mussels wrapped in a polenta tamal with radishes and salmon roe. Everything I love in one dish. Herbs in the polenta stayed super green and fresh, and the roe added a perfect saline pop. Radishes balanced the whole dish out. 

Tetela de Huitlacoche

The star of the night. Three heirloom corns, huitlacoche “truffle” filling, hedgehog + maitake mushrooms, shaved truffle. A crazy amount of components that somehow still felt elegant and cohesive. Extremely memorable.

**Second Course** (served with blue tortillas)

Mole de Camarón

Whole blue prawns in a bright, smoky mole with local butternut and shiso. Vibrant and layered without being heavy.

Mole Negro

A5 Wagyu, braised Wagyu cheek, fondant sweet potato, laid on top of avocado leaf black beans, and the legendary 32-ingredient, 3-day mole. Other star of the show. Deep, complex, rich, but incredibly approachable thanks to the Wagyu.

**Dessert**

Torta de Requesón

Ricotta cheesecake with mamey. Light, not overly sweet, and a great reset after all that mole.

Pastel de Chocolate y Mezquite

Possibly my new favorite dessert in Chicago. So many components: chocolate piloncillo sauce, slightly salty tortilla ice cream with corn husk dust, corn masa crumble, rich and airy chocolate canela cream, and cacao nibs on the cake for crunch. Savory-sweet perfection. And so many components that every bite is a little different. 

**Petit Fours**

To finish, they brought out digestif sweets. I can’t remember the who the collaboration was with on the chocolate, but WOW. Coffee + mole negro bonbon (using that same 32-ingredient mole) – spicy, funky, and INTENSE. Paired perfectly with a prickly pear gummy to cleanse the palate after such a wild bite.

**Overall**

Fantastic Restaurant Week experience. For $60 per person, this felt like a steal. Food, pacing, and hospitality were all on point. They still gave it their all even for a restaurant week menu. A reminder that Topolobampo is dedicated to their hospitality certainly deserves their star.",38,1769273331.0,chicagofood,5,1.0,False

I moved to a new town in the past year and have struggled to find new friends, so here I am giving this a shot.

A little more about me: I go to the gym pretty often (not a gym bro don’t worry not about that culture), I enjoy traveling to new places and going and trying out new coffee shops, I game quite a bit (converted to pc gaming last year and it’s the best), and I like to watch racing like F1 and Supercross.

I’m just looking for some kind people to talk with and befriend. I am a pretty mellow and laid back person so that’s the kind of energy I invite in. If anyone has any interest in being friends just hit me up! I also have discord if that’s easier to chat on.

I’ve had my currently laptop (Acer Nitro 5) since junior/senior year of high school (6ish years ago) and it’s been struggling for a while now, just haven’t had the money to spend on a new one. I also just got a security notification saying I can’t run windows 11 and I got a “security add-on” for free until Oct 2026. 

I’m a pretty casual(?) gamer for the most part, I’ll play stardew valley, sims (with plenty of mods), the forest, etc. But I’m hoping to get into some more demanding games like baldurs gate. I’ll also be using this laptop for school. 

That being said I’m aware I’m kind of asking a lot out of these recommendations but I really have no understanding of laptop specs and all of that. 

I don’t care much about battery life, although it would be nice to have the ability to take my laptop to a coffee shop and sit for a few hours while I do schoolwork. Budget would preferably be under $1k, but lower is even better. I’d like a good bit of storage if possible (I’m not sure how to use an external storage or add more storage in some way but am open to suggestions), and obviously something capable of running some heavier games. I do plan on getting a fan for under the laptop, that’s the only thing I’m aware of that’s helpful in owning gaming laptops!

1qlrra4,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1qlrra4/what_we_didnt_tell_the_police/,What We Didn’t Tell the Police,"My brother and I agreed on one thing the night it happened:

we would never talk about it again.

It was supposed to be a shortcut.

Evan and I were driving back from a late shift, cutting through an old industrial road that most people avoided. No streetlights. No houses. Just asphalt, weeds, and silence. He was driving. I was half-asleep.

Then the car jolted.

Not a crash. Not exactly.

More like… resistance.

Evan slammed the brakes. We sat there, breathing hard, listening to the engine tick as it cooled. The headlights caught something in the road—something lying unnaturally still.

A man.

He wasn’t moving.

“I didn’t see him,” Evan whispered. “I swear.”

I got out first. I don’t know why. Maybe because I wanted to believe I could fix it. The man’s eyes were open, staring past me. His chest wasn’t rising.

I looked back at my brother. He was still in the car, hands locked on the steering wheel like it was the only thing holding him upright.

“Call an ambulance,” I said.

Evan shook his head. “We’ll lose everything.”

Those words settled between us, heavy and final.

We didn’t argue. That’s the part that still haunts me. We just… decided. Together. We dragged the body off the road, into the tall weeds. The night swallowed him like he’d never existed.

When we drove away, neither of us spoke.

The next morning, Evan threw up in the sink. I couldn’t look at my phone without expecting a notification—an alert, a headline, something that would expose us.

Nothing came.

Instead, strange things started happening.

At first, it was small. Evan swore he heard footsteps outside his apartment at night. I started seeing a man standing at the edge of my vision, always gone when I turned my head.

Then it got worse.

Every time we passed that road, the radio cut out. Static, followed by a low, rhythmic thumping—like something knocking from far away. Evan stopped sleeping altogether. I found him once sitting in his car at 3 a.m., engine off, staring at nothing.

“We should go to the police,” I said.

He laughed. Too hard. “And say what? That we waited until guilt drove us insane?”

The guilt didn’t just sit in our chests. It followed us. It crept into our dreams. In mine, the man was always standing in the road again, unharmed, watching us slow down—waiting to see what we’d choose this time.

A week later, Evan called me, voice shaking.

“I saw him,” he said. “In the mirror.”

That was when I knew we couldn’t keep running.

We walked into the station together. I remember the smell of old coffee and disinfectant, how ordinary everything felt compared to the chaos inside my head.

We told them everything.

The road. The body. The choice.

The officer listening didn’t interrupt. He just nodded slowly, typing notes, his expression tightening with each detail.

When we finished, he leaned back in his chair.

“You’re not the first,” he said quietly.

My stomach dropped.

“The man you described,” he continued, “was reported missing two weeks ago. We found his body yesterday. Construction crew. About a mile from where you said it happened.”

Evan’s face drained of color. “Yesterday?”

The officer nodded. “Cause of death wasn’t the impact. Hypothermia. He was alive for hours after being hit.”

The room went silent.

Everything inside me collapsed at once—the fear, the guilt, the hope that confession might save us.

It was already too late.

1qlroxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1qlroxn/how_to_text_someone_you_like_without_looking/,How to Text Someone You Like Without Looking Desperate: The Psychology Behind Effortless Communication,"Look, I've spent way too many hours analyzing text messages. Literally staring at my phone debating whether to send ""hey"" or ""hey!"" like the punctuation would determine my entire romantic future. Studied this shit through books, podcasts, relationship psychology research because I was TIRED of the anxiety spiral every time I had to text someone I was into.

Here's what nobody tells you: that desperate vibe you're worried about? It's not about what you say. It's about the energy behind it. And yeah, there's actual psychology backing this up.

## 1. Stop treating texts like they're life or death negotiations

The biggest mistake is turning every message into some strategic chess move. Research from Dr. John Gottman (relationship expert who can predict divorce with 90% accuracy) shows that authenticity matters way more than perfect timing or clever lines.

Your brain goes into overdrive when you like someone because of dopamine and attachment systems firing up. That's normal biology. But when you're overthinking every word, you're basically telling yourself ""I need to perform to be worthy of their attention."" That energy bleeds through your texts.

Instead: Just text like you're talking to someone you genuinely enjoy. Not a friend, but also not some high-stakes interview. If something reminds you of them, send it. Saw a meme they'd like? Share it. No need to wait exactly 3 hours to seem ""busy.""

## 2. Match their energy but don't mirror their timing

There's this stupid ""wait twice as long as they took to respond"" rule floating around. Trash advice. But there IS something to matching energy levels.

If they send paragraph texts full of details, they probably enjoy that communication style. If they're more concise, keep it tighter. The book ""Attached"" by Amir Levine (psychiatrist who studied adult attachment for years) explains how people have different communication needs based on attachment styles. Some people need more reassurance, others need more space.

What matters: Are they engaged? Asking questions back? Using more than one-word answers? If yes, you're good. If no, pull back slightly and see if they initiate.

## 3. Have a life worth texting about

This is the game changer nobody wants to hear. The best way to not seem desperate is to literally not BE desperate. When your entire day revolves around when they'll text back, that's a red flag for you, not them.

I started using this app called Finch for building better daily habits (it's like a self-care tamagotchi, weirdly addictive). Another tool that's been surprisingly helpful is BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that pulls from relationship psychology research, dating expert insights, and communication books to create personalized audio content. You can tell it something specific like ""improve texting communication in early dating"" and it generates a custom learning plan and podcast episodes tailored to your situation. The content draws from vetted sources, real relationship experts, and behavioral psychology studies. You can adjust the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries to detailed 40-minute deep dives with examples. Having consistent things you're working on, hobbies you're into, goals you're chasing means you're not refreshing your messages every 30 seconds. You're actually busy living.

Mark Manson talks about this in ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck"" (sold millions, brutally honest about modern relationships). When you're invested in your own life, you naturally become more attractive because you're not making them your entire world before you even know them properly.

## 4. Learn the difference between interested and available

You can be genuinely interested without being constantly available. There's this weird idea that if you really like someone, you should respond instantly and always be down to hang. That's not interest, that's anxiety.

Esther Perel (relationship therapist, has this insanely good podcast ""Where Should We Begin"") talks about how desire needs space. If you're always immediately available, there's no room for anticipation or curiosity.

Practically: It's fine to see their text, smile about it, and respond when you're actually free to have a conversation. Not playing games, just respecting your own time. If you're at dinner with friends, be present there. Text them properly later.

## 5. Stop seeking validation through their responses

The desperate energy usually comes from needing their reply to feel okay about yourself. You send something, they don't respond for hours, and suddenly you're spiraling about what you did wrong.

This is where ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear (Wall Street Journal bestseller, insanely practical) helped me. He talks about building identity-based habits. Instead of ""I need them to like me,"" shift to ""I'm someone who communicates authentically and handles rejection without falling apart.""

Try this: Before sending a text, ask yourself ""Am I sending this to connect with them, or to get reassurance that they still like me?"" If it's the second one, pause.

## 6. Use voice notes strategically

Text loses so much nuance. Your humor might read as sarcasm, your excitement might seem over the top. Voice notes let your actual personality come through without the weird formality of a phone call early on.

But timing matters here. Don't send a 4-minute voice note when they're sending two-sentence texts. Maybe try a short 15-second one about something funny that happened. Gauge their response. Some people love them, others find them overwhelming.

## 7. Know when to move off text

If you've been texting for weeks and nobody's suggesting meeting up, that's a problem. Text should build connection but it's not a replacement for actual interaction.

The book ""Modern Romance"" by Aziz Ansari (yeah the comedian, but he worked with actual sociologists on this) breaks down how endless texting often kills potential relationships. People build up these fantasy versions in their head then meet and reality can't compete.

After a few good text exchanges: ""I'd love to continue this conversation over coffee"" or whatever fits your vibe. If they're interested, they'll say yes or suggest an alternative. If they deflect repeatedly, you have your answer.

## 8. Stop apologizing for existing

""Sorry for the long text"" ""sorry if this is annoying"" ""sorry for bothering you"" — every time you apologize for normal human communication, you're positioning yourself as someone who shouldn't take up space. That's the most desperate thing you can do.

You're not bothering someone by showing interest. You're giving them attention, which is literally what everyone wants. If THEY feel bothered by normal conversation, they're not your person.

## The actual root issue

Most ""sounding desperate"" problems aren't about texting technique. They're about not believing you're worth someone's genuine interest. So you overcompensate, overthink, and exhaust yourself trying to be perfect.

The research is pretty clear on this from multiple studies in social psychology: confidence (not arrogance) is attractive because it signals you have resources, you're secure, you can handle adversity. Desperation signals the opposite.

But here's the thing, building that confidence isn't about faking it. It's about genuinely investing in yourself so much that any individual person's response to your text doesn't shatter your entire self-worth. When you know you're solid regardless, texting becomes easy because there's no real stakes. Either they're into it or they're not, and both outcomes are fine.

hey everyone, figured i'd share a quick heads-up on parking for the jordan bluth show on sunday, 01/25, at 3:00 pm. parking around downtown chandler is actually pretty good, but for an afternoon show on a weekend, the closest spots can fill up fast if you don't time it right, and nobody wants to be late for sinatra.  
  
my number one insider tip for avoiding the scramble and getting a guaranteed close spot is to check out Prked. honestly, the venue parking is free, but if you want to skip the traffic backup into the official lots and secure a private driveway or garage right next door, Prked is the way to go. it's usually way cheaper than event-specific lots at other venues and you can just stroll right over, skipping the worst of the event traffic.  
  
now, for the free official options, the chandler center for the arts is awesome because their \*\*on-site parking is totally free\*\*. the main patron lot is on the west side of the building, which you can access off chandler boulevard and california street. for the best spot in this lot, you'll want to be there no later than 2:30 pm, just to be safe.  
  
if the on-site lot is full, downtown chandler has over 4,000 free spaces, so don't stress. you have a few free garage options, which is a lifesaver, especially since the show is on a sunday:  
  
\* the \*\*oregon street garage\*\*, the \*\*overstreet garage\*\*, and the \*\*city hall garage\*\* are all free and open 24/7.  
\* the \*\*johnathan parking garage\*\* and \*\*the alexander parking garage\*\* are also free to the public all day on weekends. these are all a short walk, maybe 5-10 minutes, past the downtown restaurants.  
  
there's also a ton of free surface parking available along arizona avenue (between buffalo and boston) and on san marcos place. just pay attention to any posted signs, but it's generally good to go on the weekend.  
  
a super helpful alternative if you don't want to drive is the \*\*chandler flex\*\* service. it's an on-demand, shared public transportation service in the area, and they've been running rides for free during a promotional period. download the app and you might be able to get a quick ride right to the door.  
  
since this is a sunday 3:00 pm show, we don't have to worry about the crazy weekday rush hour or school zone accessible parking restrictions, so traffic should be fine as long as you account for event-day volume near the arizona ave/chandler blvd intersection. just aim to get downtown a little early (2:15-2:30 pm) to lock in your free spot and grab a coffee before the show.  
  
hope this helps everyone get parked easily for the concert!",1,1769272532.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I posted yesterday looking for opinions on whether I was letting my anxiety control me and whether my husband was right in thinking it’s good for us and for the baby to leave him with his mother for an hour or two (despite him being EBF and a very frequent feeder). 

Original post here 
https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/s/zZ1JFaThxL

TLDR; trust your gut. 

So, today we did it. I gave in and we went for a coffee for just over an hour and left the baby with his mom. I pumped a few ounces just in case, although my baby refuses the bottle but I felt better knowing I was leaving at least something for desperate times, even if he’d refuse it. 

Basically it was horrible. I cried the second I went out the front door and didn’t stop until the drive home. I couldn’t have a conversation with my husband, I couldn’t stop feeling like I was drowning. 

Maybe it’s my anxiety. I’m not denying that. The baby was fine and was asleep when we got home, had been a bit grumpy but they’d got him to sleep by dancing round the living room. 

Maybe it’s my anxiety. But regardless, I was NOT ready for this step. And now I feel even worse than if I’d not gone at all - because now I feel guilt that my husband had to sit there and watch me cry for an hour, he kept begging for us to go home but I said we couldn’t because I was embarrassed having to explain myself to his mom, and he said it didn’t matter and there was no reason for me to torture myself. We didn’t talk about anything other than that I was crying. It was truly horrible. 

Now I feel I’ve taken 2 steps back in ever going out with him without the baby again. I wasn’t ready. I knew I wasn’t ready. I told myself it’s my anxiety talking making me not want to go, and I should push through. But the pushing through didn’t help. I really don’t think I was ready. 

The opinions on here were very divided which was interesting. Ultimately, my advice for anyone in a similar position is to trust your gut. 4 months is still quite fresh postpartum. I don’t know when it will get better for me, hopefully soon. ",0,1769271794.0,NewParents,33,0.46,False

To explain slide 3, which would otherwise appear to be unrelated....while sipping on said coffee, I am also revisiting my childhood with episodes of Speed Racer via Tubi (I am 5 months younger than Yo).  I can't remember when I watched any of this last...it's been many years....and I am having a nice chuckle over the character of Spritle, as the first and only thing to come to my mind with maroon/burgundy overalls was the candid shot of hide from the Pink Cloudy Sky book, written by his ex-Saver Tiger bandmate, REM.  If only hide were also wearing one of his signature knit caps!  It must have been a HOT night when the shot was taken as he was not known for showing much skin very often (unlike Yoshiki!)....as if him in OVERALLS, period, is not amusing enough. 😸",18,1769271790.0,visualkei,1,1.0,False

Grinder : Koryaiko DF54

Machine: Bambino plus

First time ko po mag grind ng coffee, I started at 18 on the df54's dial. Tas ayun standard puck prep ( Vdt,Distributor, and tamp). Not sure what went wrong, so I tried naman to make the grind courser, 25 na kagad, pero ang kalat pa din ng extraction.
