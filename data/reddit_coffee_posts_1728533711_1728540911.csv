1g0ccfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1g0ccfk/highly_recommend_brazil_run_and_my_tips_for/,Highly recommend Brazil run and my tips for Magnanimous achievement,"So I have been very bored of this game lately and came back to it today to try my hand at a magnanimous monarch run. Most fun I've had in Victoria 3 in a long time. I highly recommend it. Here are a few of my tricks.

1. Economy will be slow, it's normal. Don't go ham right away on construction cause your low population and just shit economy won't be able to handle it. I started slow with mostly plantations (check what sells, and Brazilians have a coffee obsession if I remember correctly), building up steadily but slowly. 

2. Attack your neighbors fast, go ham right away, non of them can really fight you and don't hesitate to use Enlistment edict for extra conscripts if the battle seems close or if a european power decides to fuck with you. 

3. Speaking of european powers, if you're lucky like I was, Britain will get involved in one of your wars, more reliably Paraguay and Uruguay since they have the interest there at start, and they will pretty reliably just ask for ban slavery, so rush the one state country and defend as best as possible on the Britain front, hopefully, the main target capitulates and you can capitulate once only Britain is left to get a free and easy ban on slavery. That's a very easy and quick Pedro point right there. Try to nab an alliance with France if possible, I know they're not the most reliable with their million revs but they'll keep the british off your ass for the beginning.

4. There's no easy and quick way I can think to lower Aristocrat clout aside from a rev, I decided to do it slowly. Just build up, change laws when possible and once Pedro comes of age, you can put them out of government and suppress them while you bolster the Intelligentsia. 

5. Imo, avoid laws that will make you lose authority you will use it for everything it's worth. Obv, social mobility is key to quickly making your people literate and qualified and later on join the Intelligentsia. I didn't really need road maintenance that much except at the beginning since most of your good states are coastal and ports can carry you for a bit until you get railways. 

6. Brazil has some very good ressources, but it does lack some for the late game like Sulfur and Coal (There's some but not a lot) so a mistake I made is not going for strategic states for those resources in my peace deals when I puppeted the South American nations. 

7. Another mistake I made is kinda forgetting to build universities earlier, so I lagged a bit behind on technology and again Universities are great for Intelligentsia clout. Whenever you can and your economy can take it, build some universities.

8. The River of Coffee journal entry kinda sucks but is feasible with some work, but I honestly found it very underwhelming, so I don't think it's worth it. I did get a kick out of beating EIC at coffee production. If you wanna do it, my tip is subsidize the plantations, build them in the states that have coffee/plantation bonuses and export like crazy, with enough building up you'll do it. Once it was done I just stopped subsidizing and downsized my plantations as much as I could. (I was already on interventionism and industrializing, so the plantations weren't as useful anymore.)

9. I didn't do it in my game, but if you ally France, you could try to find a war of theirs to get involved in in exchange for French Guyana and then use them to crush Netherlands for their Guyana or nab it if the Dutch feel like messing with one of your wars and maybe keep Britain as the last boss for their Guyana once you feel ballsy enough to take them on. You should be able to end the game with all of South America under your control. 

Honestly, just have fun with it, be patient and enjoy the roleplay, it has some of the best flavor I've had to experience in Vic 3. Now I just need Paradox to do the same for Canada and Quebec, I want my Patriot Rebellion in 1837-1838 and just more flavour for Canada in general. Canada unifying under a french canadian admin is so ahistorical and happens all the time just cause confederating is literally just a button with no actual decisions or flavour. I wanna fight for it, or even better, a free and independent Quebec :D",1,1728540662.0,victoria3,0,1.0,False

1g0c9tc,https://v.redd.it/ufcch4qtdvtd1,I want those thick velvety droplets,"Hi, so I’ve got a Sage Barista Pro, using a cheap bottemless portafilter, with 17g of a medium roast coffee. The shot pulled in 29s, including 2s preinfusion., and tasted glorious. I’m happy dialling coffees in and getting the taste where I want them, but I’m being purely vain now. I’m so jealous of some of the videos posted here of the super thick, slow, velvety initial droplets of espresso to come out. I want some of that sweet sweet beauty, however my shots always seem to start fast and seem kind of watery before producing that thick cream filled liquid.
Is it just the roast that I’m using, or maybe I need a precision basket, or less preinfusion?

I am so confused rn. 

We met like a month before all this happened so it wasn't even that long and I remember when I texted all the best on her new job she didn't reply for a week and I texted her again asking how was it going.

She blames me for the lack of effort but she has ignored me and I am in a rough phase and I have apologized and explained and still I am the bad guy.

I am still scared that one day she will blow up phone up and blame me for everything after so coldly cutting me off and all of this was so sudden and it breaks my heart. ",2,1728540329.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

1g0c5ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g0c5ov/chest_pain_lasting_days_22m/,Chest Pain lasting days - 22M,"22M, 175lbs, white, I do drink on the weekends, I workout, and I have used nicotine pouches for 2 years (maybe important).

So I've been having some chest pain the past few days, its aching really bad in the center of my chest where my sternum is and I feel some 'tingliness' radiating into my left arm or left foot randomly sometimes. I also noticed today I twisted my torso and I felt shooting pain on my side, not awful, but definitely noticeable.

For some more context, I've felt a similar chest pain before but it'd only last a few hours and so previously I had gone to get checked \~6mos ago for that and my blood pressure, heart rate, EKG, all came back fine. However, the past few months I have been trying to kick my addiction to nicotine, and I think over the past few weeks I've sporadically felt some chest pain, mainly last week and this past weekend until now which I have wondered if that is correlated. However, it wasn't continuous nonstop pain until the last 4 days. I wonder if it is nicotine related, but things don't add up IMO. I would go a week or two without doing any and I'd crave nicotine but I would have no pain, but then last week I do them and I get some pain, then this weekend I have some pain occasionally even if I do them, and now I've quit and the pain is constant. People who have had similar chest pain online seem to report that once they quit doing the pouches the pain goes away, or even if it is withdrawals it doesn't last too long. Mine has been going on for days... 

I've asked around and looked up everything, but I really don't know. The only symptoms I have are chest pain; no nausea, dizziness, sore threat, shortness of breath, etc. It hurts the same whenever I'm laying down or walking around, just constant. I drank a fair bit this previous weekend (friend's bachelor party), so I've been told it could be that, but I felt sporadic pain before this past weekend - it would just come and go. I do workout a fair bit, so maybe I strained a muscle? Maybe it is the nicotine side effects and I have acid reflux as I did swallow the saliva, my gut does feel messed up as I feel like I have to go more than usual, but its been 3 days since i quit? I've thought it could be withdrawals, but again, I felt this same pain in the past few weeks when I was still using nicotine pouches, it was just not nearly as frequent. I've also been told it could be stress/anxiety since I'm working full time post graduation and apparently my future BIL and his friends all had similar experiences post-grad. I've looked into Angina, Costochondritis, Heartburn, etc. etc. but none of my symptoms match perfectly except with 'heart attack' it seems, but again, this has been going on for days so....?

I do also drink caffeine semi-regularly, and last week I drank pretty much one can of celsius a day with I think wednesday and thursday last week I drank two as I had some very long days. I've been told maybe it's that? Sunday I had a coffee but that's been it for the past few days. 

IDK, I'm very concerned, but I also don't want to spend all this money on going to a doctor just for them to say they don't know either but my heart is fine. I've tried antacid meds and ibuprofen today and it hasn't helped.",1,1728539844.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I have IST and am taking Ivabradine 5mg. However, my cardiologist recently added Propanolol 10mg, as I needed more HR control but couldn't tolerate a higher Ivabradine dose.

Thankfully, the Propanolol has been very effective at helping my HR without lowering my BP too much (although that being said, its now at 100/60 - I cant go any lower). As a bonus too, I've been able to drink coffee again with almost no problems thanks to the anti-adrenergic effect!

At the same time, I also don't really like being on Propanolol. It makes me feel very flat and emotionally numb, like almost depressed but not quite that bad. It's hard to get up in the morning and I think its made my brain fog a tad worse. I also never used to get blood pooling, but now on Propanolol my legs turn purple when I stand too long 🫠


I'm thinking about asking to switch to a different BB, but I'm worried they'll all have the same fatigue/mental health side effects as Propanolol (or be even worse!)

1g0c2ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/squidgame/comments/1g0c2ps/fan_theory_collaboration_help_create_an/,Fan Theory Collaboration: Help Create an Alternative Plot for Squid Game Season 2 & 3,"Hey, fellow Squid Game fans!

As we eagerly await the next season, I thought it’d be fun to put our heads together and come up with some **alternative fan theories** for what could happen in *Squid Game* Season 2 and even Season 3. Think of it as a collaborative fan fiction where everyone can contribute ideas, add twists, or expand on existing theories!

# Here's how it works:

1. **I’ve provided a sample plot outline below** that you can use as a starting point. Feel free to read it and add your ideas in the comments—whether it’s minor tweaks to an episode, brand new episodes and storylines, or even a whole new direction.
2. **Upvote** the ideas you like the most, and I’ll regularly update this post to reflect the most popular suggestions.
3. **Get creative!** The goal is to make a crowd-sourced fan theory that builds off each other's ideas. No idea is too crazy—this is for fun, after all!

**Sample Plot for Season 2**: Following the play on Korean childhood games in season 1, this fan theory depicts how adulthood and corporate life in Korea can also turn into a manipulative bloody game.

**Season 2, Episode 1 – Spoils of Survival:** Season 2 picks up immediately after Gi-hun decides to not board the plane but is forcibly pushed to board by staff when attempting to exit the boarding walkway. Before take-off, he receives a text from a private number “Enjoy your trip, 456.” Upon landing in LA, he decides to take advantage of his prize money before heading back. He books a lavish hotel and meets up with his daughter, showering her with presents, redeeming himself from the ‘gun lighter’ gift, and showing his ‘bread-winning’ capabilities as a father. Later, his daughter opens up about the difficulty his ex-wife Eun-ji is enduring with her new husband. Gi-hun and Eun-ji cross paths when dropping off his daughter. They catch up for a quick coffee and Eun-ji breaks down in tears. After consoling Eun-ji, Gi-hun feels like his family has a chance of coming back together, supported by his newfound financial stability. Eun-ji leaves her current husband, and the family move back to Korea together, where Gi-hun quickly purchases a family home using the remaining prize money as a deposit. He manages to uphold his image of stability for now but realises he will need a job to support mortgage payments. Gi-hun manages to find a well-paying job in a rotational program at a start-up called SG Technologies – a disruptive software provider for electronics hardware that enables seamless integration to generative AI capabilities.

**Season 2, Episode 2 – Cubicles and Coffins:** Gi-hun enjoys his first day at work, goes through induction training for newcomers and is allocated desk space. The office energy is vibrant. Albeit being a start-up, employees are still expected to wear suits into work and be punctual. On his way home from his first day, he receives a notification from his bank that his salary had been paid – monthly in advance. 4,560,000 won ($4560). Ecstatic, he goes home to his daughter and wife and enjoys a homemade Korean meal and fulfills the family image he has longed for. Life is great for Gi-hun. After a month on the job, Gi-hun is informed the induction program is over and he will be relocated to another branch, on the outskirts of Seoul. Officetel accommodation will be provided by the company to assist with relocation. Given Gi-hun had just purchased a home, he will have to leave his family behind for now and move to new branch location first. On his first day at the new branch, he notices a very different working environment to the one he saw back in Seoul. Employees were exhausted and lifeless. Along with three other employees that were relocated, they try to blend in. Immediately, Gi-hun and the other new recruits receive a task to update an excel accounting file by 5pm. Determined to make a good impression, Gi-hun finishes early and submits the completed task. At 5pm, employees are ushered into a break room, except one employee who had yet to finish the task. Alone in the office, the employee notices a hand covered with a black glove placed on his shoulder. He swivels his chair to see a man in a black suit and a familiar netted mask marked with a hangul (Korean alphabet) symbol in white and pointing a gun. At the sound of the gunshot, champagne is also popped in the breakroom to celebrate the employee of the month with lifeless and forced cheering. When celebration snacks are complete, employees head back to their desks where men in black suits are seen cleaning up and carrying a body in an all-familiar box with pink ribbon. Existing employees are unfazed as they are seated quietly while Gi-hun’s face is covered in shock on realisation he has been sucked back into the game again.

**Season 2, Episode 3 – King of Karaoke:** Filled with confusion, fear, and anger, Gi-hun cycles through his options in his company-provided accommodation. He decides not to tell his family and ruin the image of stability he has worked hard for. He cries with mixed emotions as he eats a bowl of ramen and kimchi that was provided in the accommodation. After dinner, he writes up a resignation letter. Back at work, he wrestles with himself to submit his resignation letter and decides to do it after lunch. Another new recruit had the same idea but submitted hers in the morning. She is ushered into an office room by her manager who walks through the employment contract which stipulates resignations after the first month incur consequences determined by management. After a rant by the employee threatening legal action, she confirms her resignation. Men in black suits are later seen carry a black box in and out of the meeting room. Fearing the same consequence for himself, Gi-hun holds off on his decision. At 5pm, Gi-hun is forcibly invited to a ‘hwe-shik’ – Korean work dinner and drinks. His team enjoy wagyu Korean barbeque and soju. Employees seem relaxed, which gives Gi-hun some comfort as he cautiously participates in the food and drinks also. Employees then go to a second round to a karaoke called King Karaoke. Energised and drunk, one of the new employees picks up the microphone, tie wrapped around his forehead and signs a song out of tune. He receives a karaoke score of 32. Gi-hun laughs. The karaoke room door opens revealing a man in a black suit and netted mask. He shoots and kills the employee. The suited mans hands the mic to another employee who sings and receives a score of 92. He is ushered out by the suited man. Trembling in fear, Gi-hun sings a song and receives a score of 89. Unsure if he has passed, the door opens again. The suited man ushers Gi-hun out and he ushered into a van headed for the company provided accommodation.

**Season 2, Episode 4 – Human Resources:** Gi-hun is seen video calling his family from his work provided apartment, saying how great his job is and will be relocating back to Seoul very soon. Back at work, his manager informs him his rotation in accounting is complete and he will be moving into human resources. His request to be relocated to Seoul is heard and he is able to reunite with his family. Fearing consequences for his family if he doesn’t show up for work, Gi-hun continues to work diligently. His new role in human resources requires him to recruit ten new employees by the end of the month by managing job advertisements and candidate pipeline. To his surprise, the job descriptions used are the same as the ones he had seen when he applied. Now, Gi-hun will be the one interviewing new candidates and determining their fate. Throughout the month, he interviews hundreds of people, enticed by the lack of job experience required and attractive compensation. He interviews people from struggling backgrounds including single mothers to senile people caring for their families. At the end of the month, the number of candidates was not the problem, but the morale conflict in deciding who is trapped into this cruel game. At the end of the month, one employee who failed to shortlist ten new recruits was seen leaving in a box carried by black men in suits. Gi-hun, disturbed by the set up and corporate pyramid scheme concludes that his only way out is to win again.

**Season 2, Episode 5 – Team Outing:** Today’s menu at the company cafeteria is seaweed soup. Consequently, a Korean meal signifying one’s birthday. Gi-hun’s birthday. During his bittersweet meal, a fight breaks out among employees. Shouting is heard regarding who deserves the promotion to manager. Black men in suits enter to break up the fight. An announcement is made stipulating unprofessional behaviour in the corporate environment will not be tolerated. Both employees are shot and carried out in boxes. The next day, a work outing is organised. Employees are to participate in series of activities where managers can pick their teams. Due to two employees being eliminated, Gi-hun is promoted to manager and is responsible for selecting a team. The first activity is a corporate escape room, located on level 4 of the office building. Gi-hun selects his team of 5 and enters the escape room together as a team. Inside the large labyrinth room, members are given clues on how to escape the room. Unfortunately for Gi-hun, some of his teammates are unable to read given their difficult upbringing. There is writing on a wall in traditional Korean hanja. A clue. An older member of his team is able to read hanja and translates its details. One member pulls on a chain leads up into the roof. Instantly an arrow is fired through the head of the member, revealing a scroll attached to the base of the arrow. Another clue. *\[opportunity to expand here…\]*

**Season 2, Episode 6 – The Salesman’s Survival:** *\[Episode detail transition to sales where Gi-hun is required to sell software to electronics hardware CEO’s at network events for survival\].*

**Your Turn!**: What do you think happens next? Does Gi-hun succeed in his quest for revenge, or does he find himself lost in the games? What kinds of new characters and challenges do you envision? Drop your ideas in the comments below and let’s shape the plot together!

1g0bz3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g0bz3j/who_put_the_blanket_on_me/,Who put the blanket on me?,"A few years ago when I was younger, I used to stay at my dad’s house a lot. During this time, I used to sleep on the sofa a lot and my sleep schedule was awful. If I had to guess I would say I committed to just falling asleep every night on the sofa maybe for almost an entire year. The only people in the house was me, my brother who at the time was no less than 4 or 5 years old, and my dad. My dad’s house was pretty big especially the downstairs and the area itself was pretty sketchy but none of this bothered me as I spent every night staying awake watching TV and playing video games until I fell asleep on the sofa from exhaustion. Nothing out of the ordinary ever really happened from what I can remember while being alone downstairs apart from one night which really messed with my head. 

I was doing my usual watching TV into the late hours of the night, my dad and brother slept in the same bed upstairs and they were both already fast asleep. There was a sofa and a chair in the living room and on the back of the chair was a pile of blankets that were placed perfectly on top of each other , I also had a laptop that I would use to death while I was watching TV, I remember that night I was getting so tired that I slouched down into the sofa, still with my laptop screen and the TV turned on in front of me. I fell asleep soon after that, I woke up feeling confused as when I finally opened my eyes, one of the blankets from the back of the chair was neatly placed on top of me, I turned my head to where my laptop was, or where my laptop should’ve been. There was a coffee table that separated the TV and sofa from itself, I looked down at the table and saw that my laptop was also very neatly closed and placed perfectly under the coffee table. The TV was turned off and the remote was again, just like everything else, perfectly placed where it belongs. I remember feeling confused and displaced as I know for a fact that I didn’t do anything of this at all, I didn’t really think much of it though for long as I just told myself that my dad must’ve came down in the night and done it all, surely right? 

Anyway, my dad eventually comes downstairs with my brother and I ask him if he did this, he looked at me confused and said no. I thought maybe he was playing a joke on me as he was the type to do that but the look on his face told me that he had no idea what I was talking about. My mind felt scattered, my brother couldn’t have done it as he was only 4 and everything was so perfectly done, it wouldn’t have been him at all. 
I started to get scared at the prospect of the entire thing, did I sleepwalk and do it myself? I tried to convince myself that it must’ve been me sleep walking but it was still strange as I’ve never sleepwalked at all before and why would I put back everything where it belongs and get the blanket? And why was everything so perfectly done? Especially the fact that there was no indication that the second blanket was taken from the rest of the pile at all, if it was me; I would’ve been sure that I would’ve left a bit of a mess behind. I’ve heard of people sleepwalking and getting food but this just wasn’t like me at all. I would say I’m quite a deep sleeper apart from when someone touches me in my sleep, I’ve always been like that and I always immediately wake up. Wouldn’t I have woken up if I felt a blanket being placed upon me? 

This continued to bother me for weeks on end and even when I returned to my dad’s house. I started sleeping upstairs in my actual bed again because of how freaked out I was. I did tell other people about the incident but I just laughed it off with them but even they were freaked out about it which just made me feel worse. I started thinking about maybe it was a ghost and I do believe in paranormal activity and the supernatural but I’ve never really taken it seriously.

Still to this day, I can’t think of a logical explanation that would make complete sense of what actually happened while I was asleep..",4,1728539062.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I paused to notice the building, saw that it had a cafe, and popped inside for a coffee. As a former touring musician (now working in physics) it reminded me of radio stations I loved visiting back in the day (such as the old Triple J or the ramshackle 4ZZZ) and the sheer range of music played has become part of my routine now. 

It feels like a cultural icon for Seattle and I hope it keeps this eclectic, friendly, and community-centric for as long as possible. Especially as I reckon I'll be grabbing more than a few coffees from the cafe there as darker weather creeps back in. Love you KEXP!

My friend and I are heading to Bangkok now we're in Phuket, and we’re so excited! We’ve already seen most of the typical tourist spots (or at least we think we have ), so this time, we’re hoping to explore a more local side of the city. We’d love your recommendations on anything that makes Bangkok special beyond the usual attractions.

We’re especially looking for:

* Cozy coffee shops and hidden gem cafés
* Unique experiences or activities that are a bit off the beaten path
* Hidden treasures in the city that we might not find in the guidebooks
* Great restaurants
* Live music venues or places with a cool vibe for concerts
* Spots where we can meet cool people!
* Board game cafés or places where we can have some fun and play games

And! if anyone would like to join us for a little adventure or just grab a coffee, you’re more than welcome! We’d love to meet some new friends in Bangkok. Actually, we have invited some of our friends on mixerdates to join us too but if you'd love to join let's meet ;)

I’m trying to figure out how to best describe my situation and feelings. I have depression and am socially anxious, but it feels like there’s something else going on now that I’ve moved away on my own. This is a long post and is part venting, part asking for help. 

I recently moved to NYC on my own. I don’t know anyone here and, while the people I work with are all lovely, I don’t exactly want to share a lot about my personal life with people I work with. Because I want to keep my personal life separate, I wouldn’t say it’s a great opportunity to make close friendships. The problem with that is, work is my only in-person social interaction. Other than occasionally stopping at a store or riding the train to and from work, I don’t leave my apartment. I desperately want to make friends but the thought of any situation where that could happen makes me want to barricade my apartment door and never talk to anyone. 

The reason I’m confused on what exactly to call this, is that I don’t think I felt this anxious about leaving my home before. When I was in undergrad, I never partied or went to bars but I did go to dorm events and hung out with a few friends. I’ve had severe depression since my tweens and have managed it with medication for over a decade now. Other than a few short episodes, my depression wasn’t terrible in college. 

The only time I did go through a period where I felt extreme anxiety leaving my dorm was after a SA experience I had my Sophomore year. That wasn’t so much about leaving my dorm itself, though. It was mostly fear of running into the guy responsible since he lived in a dorm about 900ft my dorm. 

During my master’s program I switched to a larger state school close to home. I did really well during this year and I actually miss it a lot now. I never thought I’d miss college because the private school I went to for undergrad was a horrifically negative, stressful, traumatizing environment that I was desperate to graduate from. But now I miss my one year of grad school because I’m struggling again mentally and I don’t know why or what to do. 

When I’m home with family or with the friends from my  grad school, I’m very social, I enjoy spending time with them and can even handle bigger groups and busier places. That was unimaginable before grad school but  somehow was easy this past year. Since moving though, I feel like the mild anxiety I had towards social situations is suffocating now. I also find myself terrified of being out at night or going to any social venue like bars or concerts because I’m scared someone will hurt me. It’s irrational because statistically people you know are more likely to hurt you than strangers. Also, I’m not tiny so, logistically, I’d be a fairly difficult target to go after. But I can’t help but feel panicked every moment that I’m alone outside my apartment around people. 

I don’t feel like I’m in a depressive episode because I don’t have the usual signs (extreme fatigue, struggling to shower/brush teeth/eat). I don’t know if it could be PTSD from my prior assault either because it’s been several years and I’d gotten to a really good point before. This seems more extreme than the social anxiety I’ve experienced before and it happens even when I’m going into situations where I won’t have to actually socialize, just interact with people in passing (sitting at a coffee shop for example). 

TL;DR - I have existing mental health issues but this new one seems different than the others. I haven’t left my apartment in a couple of weeks except to go to work and come immediately back home. I don’t know what’s wrong or what to do. Advice or general support is very welcome. ",1,1728536921.0,Agoraphobia,0,1.0,False

I had a few oversight that led me to having a mental block now on how to complete the trip (tl;dr - thought I could fly home from KIX but no longer the case). 

So far my trip is land Tokyo --> Hakone --> Osaka --> ?? --> leave from Narita Airport.

After Osaka, I have 4 more nights before leaving from NRT. I was originally going to do Osaka -> Kanazawa --> straight to NRT. But the 4 hour train ride from Kanazawa to NRT only to board plane after leaves little to be desired (not off the table though just want to optimize this part if possible). 

So now I'm hoping to get some insight on what I can fill this with. I am traveling with family of 4 (two kids 4/2 yo). We don't do a lot of museums/temples, but enjoy outdoors/coffee/food. I would love to add on a trip like Takayama, Kawaguchiko, Kusatsu, or similar but the train logistics just don't make sense. A few thoughts after some research.

1) Train from Osaka to Fukuoka, then fly from Fukuoka to NRT to catch the flight out of Tokyo. Short flight time but if I add on logistics and time around airport at Fukuoka, it probably adds up to same as train ride from Kanazawa. If anything Kanazawa is easier as airport is more of a hassle vs train.

2) Fly from Osaka to Sapporo, then Sapporo back to NRT. Same as above, if not more time at airport as it involves two trips there. 

3) Stay longer in Osaka, then train to Hiroshima and Hiroshima fly to NRT.

Is there anything else I can consider? I'm also open to renting a car and driving if it can optimize the trip.",1,1728536786.0,JapanTravelTips,1,1.0,False

I am adopting a BSH in few months and the kitten will probably be 12-14 weeks when we get it.

I plan on staying at a hotel and split the drive into 2 days for 8 and 8 hours so its easy for us and the kitten.

Has anyone done something similar?

You think its a good idea to get a hotel? (I can drive 16 hours straight, lots of coffee. Wouldnt be the first time doing it)

Any tips etc?

I am just worried about the kitten at that young age. I have had cats before and have done something similar when we adopted one before but that was only 4 hours.

Am I just a friend?,"I (31F) am dating a guy (34M). We matched on a dating app end of June and we've only met up five times since then. I'm actually okay with the pace because I'm new to dating and slow to process my feelings/thoughts about a date but I'm concerned that this doesn't really mean anything to him. 

Some context: we had our first date on July 4. Quick coffee date for vibe check purposes. Went okay. Not bad, but not great. After that, I had some family stuff come up so the second date was delayed until beginning of August. Date 3 was mid-September, date 4 was end of September and date 5 was beginning of October. All dates after date 1 have been dinner dates after work. Dates 2 and 3 were fancy dinners and we ended up talking for like 4 hours each time and only ended the date because the restaurant was closing. Dates 4 and 5 were chill but still around 2.5 hours of talking. All dates after date 1 have been great. Lots of talking, teasing, easy banter, laughing. 

A couple things I noticed though. One of which is that he hasn't actually asked me out on a weekend date. It's always been after work on the weekdays. The other thing is that he hasn't really made any moves. Like at all. No gentle back touching, arm touching, nothing. We do hug when we meet up but not like a full on chest to chest hug lol. Tbf I haven't initiated anything either. Even our flirting isn't really sexual...it's mainly like teasing and banter but not sexual flirting if that makes sense. 

I'm slow to getting intimate (need a connection and trust first) and I'm actually very happy with the pace because it allows me time to process along with juggling other life stuff, but I'm concerned he's not interested romantically. We do text every day since we first matched, aside from when I had the family stuff happening, but it's quick text convos in the morning and/or evening with a couple random messages during the day. Convos usually end a little after 10pm since we both get up early (we're both in the legal field, but his job is a lot more demanding as a senior litigation attorney/manager). Weekends he's usually really busy with friends and family (we both have large families we're close to so I get it) so I'll get maybe a couple messages during the day and a small convo in the evening. He always pays for the dates, like automatically just pays. There are hours of long gaps between his messages, which I'm chalking up to work/being mentally drained from work or ADHD, which he mentioned his doctors say he may have. He does mention future plans like going on road trips, etc but no real plans yet, although he does do a lot of road trips with his cousins on weekends and I can't help but think we could've done something together. Early on, he was pretty stiff/awkward/serious which is why date 1 was just okay. I did have to work on him a bit to loosen up on date 2 lol but since then it's been good. I'm thinking maybe he's shy? And it comes off as awkward/stiff/serious? Maybe he's waiting for me to initiate or bring it up?

We haven't really had a talk about physical intimacy or touch but I'm going to bring it up soon. I guess I'm just a little caught off guard since most guys usually at least imply it in some by now but he just hasn't. Again, I'm totally okay with the pace, I just don't have enough dating experience to know what to make of it.

1g0b4uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/lesserafim/comments/1g0b4uq/albumtour_predictions/,Album/Tour Predictions,"From Good Bones we got, “Easy, Crazy, Hot…I can make it.” 

So from that, we can deduce that Hot should be the next mini-album, some maybe even think full album. Personally, I lean toward mini-album. I think they want one more chance at gaining more international fans before going on tour. More importantly, Hot just doesn’t give full album title to me. Hot could also have a few different concept meanings…attractive or angry. Neither give full album concept to me though, unless they spin the angry concept really well. 

That being said, we also got “Meaningless…” from the buffer screen at the end of the Crazy MV. The last similar MV teaser we got was Yunjin with the coffee cup with “Crazy” written on it, which was the next comeback. So where does Meaningless fit into this? It doesn’t really make sense (haha), but I guess it could be the full album name or maybe tour name. 

One thing I can’t move past is the “I can make it” part in Good Bones. Not saying it doesn’t make sense because it totally does, but it does feel a little out of place. So here comes my crazy theory… the only semi-anagram with those words in it is “Kinematic”. Its not a perfect anagram, the ‘a’ is used only once, but they could spell it “Kinematica” or “Kinemaatic”

From ChatGPT…

“Kinematic” refers to the branch of mechanics that deals with the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion. It focuses on describing how things move in terms of displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time.
By using a kinematic perspective, you would analyze someone’s journey through struggle based on their movement- how they cope, adapt, and evolve- without focusing on the external causes of struggle. 

To me, and again I am totally reaching, but this could be applied so many different ways to Le Sserafim. Like “don’t worry about whats causing us to move forward (tough mental states, personal issues, all the things that come with being an idol- hate, judgement, etc), the only thing matters is that we ARE moving forward.” 

I’m so aware this is a stretch, but the anagram part of it would fit well with the concept. I think this is the album name and Meaningless is the tour name maybe…or switched..idk 

Anyone have any thoughts? 

EDIT: GUESS WHO DEVELOPED KINEMATICS? 

GALILEO….. 

Haha ha ha ha hahahah

He says it’s just a joke, and i do belive him. But, if i’m gonna be honest it makes me super uncomfortable. I talk to him about it, and it turns into an argument and he basically gaslights me into thinking i’m sensitive over it. The next morning he always apologizes and promises not to do it again, and then it happens again. Recently, we had a major argument. One of my female friends (he’s bi) told me he was flirting with her. He basically told her she was super pretty, and that if she wanted to he would leave me to be with her. I brought it up, and it quickly became him yelling at me that i was sensitive, then i was just like in my head ‘does it even matter anymore? he’s just gonna keep doing it’. So i went kinda non verbal, and jdut responsed with 1 word short answers. he was basically yelling at me for ‘not listening’ or whatever. Then basically it somehow came up (sorry it’s all really blurry) and he mentioned how i always get mad whenever he talks to girls prettier than me. (i’m a male, i’m gay and hes bi) i felt really hurt, so i went to bed. This morning i woke up and he basically said that i was throwing a tantrum last night, so i said whatever and went to make myself coffee, i purposely made just myself coffee to be spiteful, and he said i was in the wrong last night. He was saying how i get mad whenever he talks to other people, even though i just bring up how he flirts with others and talk about breaking up with me to them. Then he got mad about me not making him coffee, and said that i know how much he hates making coffee when i siad for him to make it himself. Then i got fed up after a bit more arguing, and suggested we break up. We fought some more, Then he apologize, said he would stop and won’t do it again, and of course i forgave him.

This Friday, Oct 11th is a holiday for my office. I am planning to take a small drive as I have absolutely nothing to do. I plan to stop by at some popular restaurant ~50 km away (details provided below) for a cup of coffee and then drive back home. I don't have any company who could join me and I hate driving alone. I am willing to include just one person to tag along for the whole to and fro journey that could possibly take ~4 to 5 hours depending on traffic conditions. 

If you are someone who would like to tag along, please do drop me a message. I would be happy to pick you up in my car at a location you're comfortable with and would also drop you back safe and sound at a location you prefer. This is going to be purely platonic and I am not looking for anything more than just a conversation and some company during the journey. No personal boundaries will be crossed. I intend to get back home before night time too as I don't want you to feel anxious about staying out with a stranger. Everything will be planned, discussed and finalized only after you have reviewed and approved.

I would however expect you to be comfortable connecting outside of reddit and be prepared to verify your identity well before the journey so that there are no confusions or doubts later on. I also want to be upfront in saying that I am an average looking guy, I live a very simple lifestyle and I don't exactly dress to impress. I don't smoke or drink and I am a pure vegetarian too. I am not much of a party animal too.

This is not a date so I don't care much about appearances, outfits or anything else. I just hope you're much better at starting conversations as I am an introvert by nature and do not usually talk much. It would be good if you're 30+ and from Bangalore. Full disclosure, I am married but will be travelling alone on this day.

Few things that are absolutely non-negotiable for me are that there will be strictly no alcohol involved at all throughout the journey and absolutely no smoking inside my car.

Trip details outlined below:

Date - Oct 11th (Friday)

Time - Preferably after lunch, 2 pm onwards

Travel to - Any simple and popular restaurant on the highway for a cup of coffee/snacks that you have vetted and approved (open to your suggestions too)

Distance - ~50 km one way (1.5 to 2 hours one way, depending on traffic, expect heavy traffic on Friday due to the long weekend)

Travel by: My own car

Approximate travel time: 4 to 5 hours depending on traffic

Please understand that I have never done something like this before. I am a little nervous and also excited at the same time. So kindly forgive me if there's any other detail required for you to be able to join the drive. If there's anything more you would like to know before deciding, I am more than happy to share it with you. I am just hoping to find a travel buddy in the process!!

One afternoon in 2017, I came to work with a thermos of coffee in hand with lots of cream. I worked my shift and went home. Without the thermos. For 6 months, maybe more, I would come into work and see the thermos and think, ""huh...I need to take that home"". But, I kept on forgetting to grab it when I left. Then one evening, many months later I finally grabbed it and got on bart back home. While I was on there crossing the bay, a random man came up to me, and asked me for a drink from my thermos, and I obliged. That man must've been horrified when that old as time coffee hit his taste buds. He drank most of what was in there, cause the thermos was more than half full. He must've been horrified as those moldly clumps of coffee and cream went down his throat.

Growing up in a neighborhood where struggles were common, he learned the importance of community and connection early on. His life took a turn when he joined a coffee equipment company, where he discovered his passion for coffee during a trip to Italy. The vibrant café culture inspired him to dream of creating a similar experience in America, where coffee could bring people together.

However, when Schultz proposed transforming Starbucks from a retail coffee bean company into a café experience, he faced skepticism. Undeterred, he bought the company in 1987 and rebranded it, focusing on creating a warm, inviting atmosphere for customers. He introduced innovative ideas like comfortable seating and Wi-Fi, turning Starbucks into a third place between home and work.

As the company grew, Schultz faced significant challenges, including economic downturns and criticism for its rapid expansion. During these tough times, he made difficult decisions, such as closing underperforming stores and refocusing on quality, demonstrating resilience and adaptability.

In response to declining sales, Schultz returned as CEO in 2008 and prioritized the company’s core values. He invested in employee training and ethical sourcing, reaffirming Starbucks’ commitment to quality and community. Under his leadership, the company expanded globally, reaching over 30,000 stores worldwide and becoming synonymous with premium coffee and community engagement.

Schultz stepped down in 2018, but his legacy of innovation, inclusivity, and social responsibility remains. His journey inspires countless entrepreneurs to prioritize values over profit.

I'm F (30 smth) and my wife is F (40 smth). We've been together for over 10 years, and got married earlier this year, because I thought it would finally give her security, and would stop jealousy.

Our relationship was turbulent from the start, with constant break ups and threats of leaving me because I did not value her enough, I did not support her enough, I did not spend enough time with her. All while I was finishing university, building my career and supporting us financially 99% of the time. But I also was ""never happy with the jobs she got"" - 4 jobs over the course of 10 years, each lasted less than 6m.

But recently we've moved countries and it became unbearable. She's constantly jealous of every single man who hugs me, stands too close to me, writes me, likes my stories, has coffee with me. I'm a connector and a natural networker, I also always saw our relationship as a buffer and a shield against unwanted attention. And I always, always keep my distance and my boundaries with all of my friends. But I'm also constantly being accused of wanting to cheat. Or even just of spending too much time with other people. I work in tech and I support 2 people, what else am I supposed to be doing?

I tried to call off the wedding, because we had episode 2 months before when she was away, packing our old apartment, and screamed at me while we were talking on the phone, that she hates me. I simply asked her if it was reasonable to sell all the furniture in that apartment a month before she was supposed to come to me. We reconciled afterwards, but this is a constant source of guilt for me now.

Since then, things went downhill. We got married, spend few terrible months together. I started keeping notes, out of 30 days we had huge fights (the ones where I cried) on 15 days. I asked for separation. We did not go NC, she was constantly at me, blaming me for torturing her and for asking her to do this. She went through with it but never agreed with it. We've been in family therapy for 10 months, and it has not become better.

I think I'm close to leaving, but I also cannot leave. And we keep having fights every other day. Sometimes we'd have a few  good days: 2-3, but that's it. And despite all of this she keeps building plans for the future.  Even though, when I brought up that I want kids in 2 years, and we have to get our health checked, and start saving to be able to afford to have them (almost a year ago, I thought we should clarify it before the wdding) - she told me that this is my dream, and how's she supposed to become rich and famous and give me kids within 2 years. And now 1 year is gone. We're really nowhere. And I don't know what to do.

She has not been working regularly or never supported herself fully financially for over 10 years.

The reasons I'm writing it here are:

a) my therapist suggested she's bpd around 2 years ago. a year ago she was almost sure. A few months ago she told me to start planning to leave, and now she's pushing for it. We've been working together for 8 years. but my wife went to therapy and her therapist said she does not have bpd. she's ben working with her since our separation = 6m, and before that for 3 months a year ago and she stopped because she told me she dealt with all her problems. Before that, she was never able to stay in therapy for longer than 2-3 months, even though I've been pushing her to do it for years. I always got blamed that I don't want to listen to her and spend time with her, that's why I tell her to go to the therapy and to go find friends.

b) I started sharing with some friends how my relationship looks like for real. But she's constantly at me for becoming closer with those friends, and I felt that it backfired. So i still share smth with them from time to time, but because she's so jealous, I feel like I almost cannot share this, and on days like this, I don't want to disturb them and be this constantly whining person. And also, they start being not nice to her, and she feels it, and blames me even more, and it's a never ending cycle.

She's an amazing person to everyone else. She's great during good days or good hours, or good parts of some days. Curious, tender, caring etc. And I don't want to paint her all bad. But at the same time, there's not much left of me.

And I don't know why I'm staying and why I cannot leave. And sometimes I think maybe she's right, and maybe I do behave like I'm available and flirt with everyone, and I should not tell my friends about our problems, and I do spend too much time focused on my work/career.

So I guess, to sum up, I live from one therapy session to another, and I'm exhausted, sour, tired and scared.

I just can’t seem to tell anyone what I need. I came from an unemotional family and could never talk to my parents about any of my problems. I would just erupt in rage at them when it got too bad. 

I have been with my partner for six years now. We have got to that stage where it feels like roommates. We get along great and are on the same wavelength, but we barely touch and haven’t had sex in a very long time. Sometimes I just feel so unappreciated and unloved. My partner can be really moody, particularly before and during her period. I take it personally and feel like she hates me, then just withdraw into myself. I think she takes me for granted in a lot of ways, that I will be there to fill her water bottle or make her a coffee etc. 

I love her and I know this is partially my fault too, as I find it hard to be romantic or say sweet things. And I need a lot of alone time, as does she. But it’s feeling like we just retreat to our areas of the house a lot more. 

I just feel this horrible pressure most of the time, like I know I have to say something but the thought of doing so makes me want to throw up. I don’t even want to break up, just get things back on track. I used to be obsessed with how we don’t have sex, but now I don’t even care about that. It would just be nice to be touched occasionally, or shown some gratitude. I used to blame being trans for the sex thing, but I know it happens in many cis relationships too. I don’t even know where I’m going with this, but I really need someone to talk to. My old therapist went crazy and my friends are so busy I don’t even get the chance to see them. I am in my 40s, for reference. 

Can anyone offer any advice? I feel so pathetic right now. ",1,1728534288.0,FTMMen,1,1.0,False

I just finished Crime and Punishment. It took me almost 10 days to complete, and I’m still processing everything. I want to write a review. It would be my first one, actually. But I need some time to gather my thoughts because right now my feelings are so scandiously mixed I just cannot put my thoughts and words together. I went through a great deal of anxiety and adrenaline while reading the book. I am not sure of others who read this book but I was through something unexplainable. Now that it's over, I’m not sure how to make sense of what I’m feeling.

So just to catch up with my time regarding the 13 week challenge, I decided to read something shorter. So it's The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde. Next up on the challenge is The Idiot. (Obvious)

Wish me luck.

1g0aqog,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1g0aqog/coffee_tea_soda_alternatives/,"Coffee, tea, soda alternatives ","Hi guy! I am happy to report that I have been caffeine free for about a week at this point with no major issues. So far so good. Actually, before I went caffeine free I did switch to decaf for about a month so I think that has helped with the transition. I haven’t noticed any periods where I’ve had an extreme lack of energy through the day and have been so far surviving through the workday I’m okay fashion. I’m holding out hope that I won’t experience any major withdrawal symptoms, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I end up having them.

The one key though that I’m struggling with is that I absolutely love the ritual of drinking something hot and with some flavor profile at my desk while I’m working. Obviously anything with caffeine is out the door, including coffee and tea. I actually tried to drink herbal tea and other non-caffeinated tea versions, but i recently discovered that I have a tea allergy. What a bummer. I quite liked mint tea in particular. Of course I’m not gonna start drinking soda and hot water with lemon or some other variation of that is just so boring to me.

Does anyone have any suggestion regarding other types of drinks that could be interesting to try?  I have batted around the idea of trying chicory root after reading online that is sort of tastes like coffee and is also caffeine free. 

What other suggestions do you folks have?  Thanks so much!",1,1728534055.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

New ways to meet people?,"Anyone older or more extroverted able to give some advice? I'm posting in this sub because I hope to get some recommendations from people in the same city or situation.

I'm a European woman in my 20s. I've lived in Korea for 5 years in total, and I am able to speak Korean at work and live my life without too many language problems. 

It finally happened. The last straw. I have used dating apps for a long time. I know they have a worse reputation in Korea, but I genuinely felt I didn't have many other options for meeting a romantic partner as I'm here alone. I'm sure I don't need to describe the differences in thinking around dating apps in Europe and Korea. But it's more than just that honestly. 

I am a people pleaser when it comes to men, so these days I'm trying to be more firm and confrontational when it comes to guys who act inappropriately. But there's only so much lying, creepy messages, and inappropriate behaviour one person can cope with. This weekend a guy called me a kimchi woman because he paid for my ₩6,000 coffee, but I refused to answer his explicit questions about my intimate life, and told him off for asking stuff he knows is disrespectful. Not the worst by far, but it's the straw that broke the camel's back.

Does anyone have any tips or recommendations for meeting new people?Widening horizens when looking for a romantic partner?

Aside from dating apps, I've tried:

* Language exchanges - Often people end up speaking in English anyway so that beginner learners can participate. It feels kinda dishonest to attend just because I want to find romantic prospects. It's kinda going against the spirit.
* 소개팅 / Friend recommendations - Already met the handful of people they are able to set me up with and didn't click.
* Hobbies - My hobbies are either mostly enjoyed by women, like certain dance styles, or something you do by yourself, like painting. Even when I do go to mixed dance classes for example, I'm often not approached by anyone who wants to socialize. Maybe because I don't look like a person who can speak Korean.
* Meeting through coworkers - I recently managed to escape from severe harrasment under a previous 팀장. I'm in a safer place now at the same company, but understandably I'm not comfortable letting my guard down at work right now.

Dating apps are so powerful because, with the amount of profiles you can see at once, you'll almost always be able to find someone you think is attractive. So, I think it wires your brain to make snap judgements. Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated \~ <3",6,1728533762.0,seoul,32,0.63,False
