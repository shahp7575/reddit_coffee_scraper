1nks4zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1nks4zw/genuinely_what_do_i_do/,Genuinely what do i do,"I joined a lab a year ago and have since learned and been told by a grad student in the lab that ifs pretty hands-off. I’ve met with the PI a couple of times and he only seems interested in me doing an honors thesis. The lab is structured really so that everyone does their own project  and since it’s computational we only really meet twice a week on Zoom to share updates. There were no other undergrads really when I joined and I’d heard too many horror stories from friends about PIs getting annoyed by their undergrads so I didn’t want to bother him. He gave me readings every now and then but no real assignments. 

Finally worked up the courage to dig around at the beginning of this year and coffee chat a bunch of people in the lab like the lab manager to ask how to get more involved. I met with her once and then asked to meet again and she ghosted me. 

The lab manager and this other girl who’s kind of in charge of the lab second only to the PI are besties and hate me. 

I wanted access to some programs and data to start my thesis idea I’ve shared with my PI. I asked for permission and it was this whole passive aggressive ordeal on their end. That was a month ago. I emailed my PI asking about it and he didn’t reply. Am I getting ghosted? What do I do? I’m just frustrated because there are other undergrads who have joined after me and are doing work and getting responsibilities and I have no idea how. I feel like I’ve tried to ask and follow up and always get the run around. ",1,1758250367.0,labrats,0,1.0,False

The power went out at around 6:30 pm and did not come back until around 9:45 pm. Worse of all, Mother was in the middle of backing some focaccia. It had been in the middle of it's cooking time when the power went off. She left it in the open, for lack of any better idea, and finished it's cooking time when we got power back. Good new is it wasn't ruined and could have turned out far worse. Bad new, it is much flatter and crunchier than she wanted it to be. Still, we ate some. She tried it wish a tomato spread and said it tasted good that way. Tomorrow, we'll have it with a light dipping oil and I'm sure it'll be lovely. Still, it is a little aggravating.

My day before the power outage was lovely. I am tired now because it is late, I ate only some cereal and bread for dinner, and I am only just getting a coffee in me so forgive me for being brief. I wrote 872 words for I'm Still Sisyphus and we are officially past 200 pages. I am slightly less happy with what I wrote today and I am sure I'll change it / add to a lot to it either tomorrow or during editing. Still, I am glad at least to be making progress.

The weather was lovely and I did my best to enjoy what may be this years last heat spell. But you can tell autumn is creeping in because once it got dark and we were without power, I was shivering under my blanket for hours. Peach and I cuddled for warmth. Good thing I bought all those tea light recently. More good news, my reading increases quite a lot during power outages. I read two and a half chapters of The Hobbit. I quite like it though it isn't quite what I was expecting. I am not sure what I was expecting but I think it was a bit grander; big, high fantasy fights. I am not at all made to see it is a much more homely adventure at least so far. I also went out for a while and did some stare gazing. The sky is so clear without all the streetlights. The big dipper is rarely as clear to me as it was tonight. With a view like that, I'd never say it was all bad. That being said, I; glad to have my heater and a hot coffee again.

1nks4i3,https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/comments/1nks4i3/i_am_convinced_its_a_circadian_rhythm_disorder/,I am convinced it's a circadian rhythm disorder.,"I have struggled with anhedonia for 4 years. I'm 35 and it started exactly when I have changed my job to an evening one. I would wakd up at 12 or 1 sometimes 2 and sleep at 4, 3 or 5 am. At first I struggled to make the connection. I really believe that anhedonia screws up with your mental faculties. Like you are in a different state of consciousness. 

I have tried everything. Supplements, exercise, therapy, all kinds of philosophies. No meds however, I saw what they did to my friends and i don't want that. Nothing worked. Life was flat. 

Then i started backtracking and looking at what really changed. I drank before, i didn't exercise, my diet was shit but one thing I had was a relatively consisteng sleep wake up time. I would always sleep at 12:30 (even if I'm drunk) and wake up at 7. On the weekends i would even sleep at 2 or 3 but still wake up at at mostly 7. So I've come to the conlusion that maybe, a consistent schedule was actually more important than 8 hours of sleep. I searched on the internet and there are countless of studies highlting the fact that consistency reduces depression and anxiety by as much as 30%. I was baffled. 

Basically, our brains need a certain amount of consistency and routine in order to function properly. Our systems are not that smart. They need cues from the world outside in order to tell if they need to turn on or off. Our organs including our brains have a clock and that clock needs to always turn on and off at the same time everyday, constant shifts would throw your body, congnition and emotion into disarray. And the result, they don't work properly or even shut down. 

I put it to the test. It has been days now that I've been training myself to sleep at 1am and wake up at 8. Granted, I still wake up groggy and tired, but for the first time in a very long time, my love for music, guitar and movies is starting to come back. My imagination is awakening from a long slumber, my anxoety and stress reduced significantly if not disappeared. I can drink coffee now withour feeling a sense of impending doom. It only took a week. And i can tell you that everyday feels better. 

You don't have much to lose. You will not find many answers here. Try it. Try waking at the same time everyday no matter how it feels. Preferably in the morning at 7 or 8 and it's extremely important to keep it that way. Go outside. Or have some sunlight. If not,then artificial light. Your system is going to start shifting and you will sleep earlier every time. Do it for a month and see how you feel. Consistency is key.

One day a guy on his computer looked like he worked from home came over to pet my dog. We talked about software (I used to work at Apple). He then said we should go on a hike sometime. 

I’m cautious, I don’t just go on hikes with strangers I just met out in the middle of nowhere where. We exchange numbers anyway and I leave. 

The next weekend comes and he says we should go on a hike and I say I’m going to be at another coffee shop(B). I have to work on something he’s more than welcome to come. He never shows up so I shrug it off thinking it would be the end of this whole ordeal.

A few days go by and I return to coffee shop(B) to work on something he’s projects and afterwards I get a text from him once again. It says “were you at coffee shop(B)?” I panic a little because I did not see him there at all wondering if I just walked by him not recognizing his face. I text him back saying oh wow I must’ve not seen you there. So now I’m like okay well didn’t see him why do I care at all it’s just some stranger. 

I usually park my van in where I know there will be shade all day to keep my dog cool. So I’m on my lunch break walking to my van and now I see him walking towards me halfway point between where I work and where I park my van. Now I’m freaked out bells are going off. He starts walking with me to my van. He wants a tour of the van. The most shocking thing was when he offered to walk my dog while I was at work. I laughed and said no thanks. 

I think he was caught off guard and said “I parked across from you” and points at a red Tesla. So I tell him I have to get back to work because this stranger literally used all of my time. So now he’s walking with me to where I work. He says he needs to get a few things anyway from where I work. Now I’m highly suspicious because my van is parked like 4 big stores down from I work. It doesn’t make sense that he would leave his Tesla which is parked across from mine and walk to the store and then walk back to his car to buy a few things. He’s also wearing the same clothes he met me in. 

Needless to say I blocked him and never heard or seen him again. I’m 100% sure he wanted to take me on a hike and had ill intentions. ",2,1758250133.0,VanLife,0,1.0,False

I leaned in, offered a little pep talk about confidence, taking risks, and going after what you want… and I swear, they actually leaned closer like they were hanging on my every word. Then they laughed, that kind of laugh that makes your chest tighten, spun around like they’d just discovered the meaning of life—or maybe just discovered me—and kept walking with a newfound swagger.

1nks1c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1nks1c6/sleeping_through_a_living_nightmare/,Sleeping Through a Living Nightmare,"My name is David and I cannot sleep. After years of insomnia, I finally was given a potential answer to my problems. Dr. Morris elected me to take part in a new clinical trial for this supposedly revolutionary sleep medication, Mintex. Excited and with nothing to lose but more sleep, I was eager to begin. My trial script came in and on the instructions it said to not leave your bed after taking it as it functions by sending your mind in a simulated dream state, so in theory it would become easier to fall asleep.

I never liked my bed, so many nights I tossed and turned and cried for reprieve. Here I am, I swallow the pill and pull my raggedy covers up and stare at the ceiling. 

\*BEEP BEEP BEEP\*

Oh man, I guess it does work, wow I do not even remember falling asleep or even dreaming. I have no room to complain, I tell myself. At least for once you don't show up to work cranky and with raccoon eyes. I get ready and get in my car. My neighbor Tom and his son Jeremiah wave to me as I leave.

I get to work and clock in. My boss seems grumpier today than usual. Howard was usually a dick but he would not stop yelling. I walk over to the coffee machine and as I am pouring, Howard walks over and tells me I need to get my work together, and to stop being so sorry for myself all the time. That threw me for a loop, I have a rage now flowing in me. I tell him we all just want him to go jump off a bridge already in a voice I don't recognize. I turn around and he is speechless and seems to be gearing up to yell at me that I am fired. Well, seconds later he did and called me a complete loser loner good for nothing. I look at the table and grab the knife and jam it into his neck, and tell him ""Finally, you're fucking quiet.""

The other workers scream and run over to cover his neck but to no avail. I run to get my stuff and make my way to front so I can get to the car. As I run out I hear my coworkers crying, calling 911, etc. We all hated him right? I run by his son and wife who are surprising him for his birthday. Wait, what just happened? I thought to myself. I love Howard, every Thanksgiving he invites me over because I have no family. What have I done? I panic, and just drop everything but my keys. I want to scream.

I drive out of the office and speed home. I am going to go to prison. I grab a bag and head to my room, grab my medicine, a suitcase, and run to my car. As I am pulling out, I see Jeremiah and his dad doing chalk blocking the street. I tell him as calmly as I can that I need him to move real quick. ""Give us a few minutes David, Jeremiah is drawing Howard. That's okay with you right?""

I play it off normally but I do not understand what he means by that. Why isn't Jeremiah at school? 

""Listen Tom, move right now or else it will get ugly."" I rev the engine. I do not know why but I did not let him respond as I hit the gas and smiled as I felt him bump under my cars' wheels. Jeremiah's screams were amazing. No they were awful, what am I thinking? I had to kill him, there was no choice.

I hit the highway and it just hits me that I do not have a plan. My mom lives an hour away, right? Why can't I remember anything? Next thing I know Howard is calling me. I let it ring. I listen to the voicemail ""Hey David, hope everything is okay, haven't heard from you today and we are all concerned. Give me a call, bye.""

I throw the phone out the window and scream. I am realizing I may have just ran over my neighbor for no good reason. I was at work. What is going on? I hit my head and scream in the rear view mirror. I compose myself, and start laughing. Wow, this is awesome, I feel awesome. That fucker is roadkill now. ""Go to school Jeremiah."" I say before laughing. I look over and see a group of girls laughing at me in the car one over on my left. You know what is funny? How about I just crash us? Right no-

My mind goes black. I wake up, and Dr. Morris is with me. Was that all a dream? Thank God. I was so evil. I start laughing and am about to tell Dr. Morris no more trial for me but as I lift my arm I hear a clink. ""Dr. Morris, whats with the handcuffs?""

""David, I have told you ten times I am not Dr. Morris. We have tried looking her up this past week, but no one in this town is a doctor with the name Morris. 

""That is a lie, what is going on? I saw her yesterday. She gave me Mintex, and it gave me a nightmare where I thought I was a monster.

""David you have been here for 3 months. You had a psychotic break, you killed your neighbors, your mailman, boss, and own mother.""

\*BEEEEP BEEEEP BEEEP\*

Oh my God. Fuck Mintex. These dreams suck, I am never sleeping ever again, i think as i lay in my bed half asleep still. 

""Prisoners time to rise and shine!""

I dart awake. What bed am I in? Prison? What is happening? I smack my face begging to finally wake up.

The warden walks over as I am yelling at myself to wake up. He starts laughing at me, and teases me before saying, ""No waking up from this nightmare David. You were desperate for sleep, yet you could not tell you were in a prison bed vs your one at home. Mintex? Hope the sleep was worth your 60 year sentence. I pity you, you can't even tell if you're dreaming even now as I am talking to you.""

1 year later, I am still locked in this nightmare, and as each day passes, the lines between what is real and what was all a dream become unclear. The worst part is I do not regret Mintex, as I was already prisoner to my own insomnia and nightmare of a life. ",2,1758250060.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

1nkrzql,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nkrzql/maintaining_balance_with_bf_25m_23f/,"Maintaining Balance With BF (25M, 23F)","Tl;dr: my bf asked me to pay him back for a game he wanted to go to, and now im reevaluating everything

So I (23F) have been dating a guy (25M) for about 5 months now. We see each other about twice a week, and he's lovely. Very nice, super positive, and has great energy. However, something (probably minor) happened recently that really rubbed me the wrong way.

I want to preface this by saying that I do pay for, and believe in paying for dates--even as a woman. In my past relationships and even current frienships, there's always been a loose 'I got this, you get the next one' or 'I'll get the tickets, you buy drinks' sorta vibe. Not hard and fast, and unspoken, but that's the general idea. For example, I was seeing a guy 2-3 years ago and he drove down 2.5 hours to see me, so I bought dinner. That's the idea--just to paint a picture.

Anyway, this guy I'm seeing prefaced that he was incredibly cheap (verbatim) when he first met me. This might be my own fault, but at first I didn't think it would be an actual issue. After all, we're all going through tough times right now--rent is sky high, groceries are basically a luxury, etc. He's been working as a full-time as an environmental scientist for about 3 years now. So I wrote it off, and thought that maybe this meant more park and coffee dates, or walks, all things that I still really enjoy.

He asked me to a baseball game a month ago. I don't like watching baseball but I was still enthusiastic about going because they has $2 hot dogs (lol). Tickets ran about $30. I had a good time and everything, until a few days after when he texted me and asked for an e-transfer (Canadian for Venmo) for the game. In all honesty, it caught me off guard since it was his idea to go. Of course, I paid him back, but I still didn't feel great about it. This was one of our first experiences and I didn't know he'd ask for an e-transfer or else I wouldn't have gone, as I don't like baseball.

We haven't been together long. I'd say it's divided pretty evenly on who pays the bill. We have inexpensive dates like I mentioned before, so not a lot of financial investment overall. The only other time he asked me to pay him back was for a $100 escape room on our first date, which was totally fair. I guess I was just taken aback, since I was unemployed at the time, and kept communting to downtown Toronto for him--which was about 30 minutes each way, $12 per trip, and an additional 40 minutes on the road to get back home. Yes, I was doing this of my own accord of course, but I suppose I'm a little saddened that despite all this commuting, time, and driving from me, he still invoiced me for $30. Hd doesn't venture out to my town a lot, unless I specifically ask. But again, maybe it's my fault since he did say that he was cheap.

Soooo, I guess I'm not sure where I go from here. Do I bring it up to him? Do I watch and observe? Or do I just let it go? Would appreciate if nayone could share their own experiences/if this has happened before.",3,1758249928.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

You’re not sure that’s solid territory. Even if he didn’t live next door to your mom, you’d rather rip off your scalp than shack up with him and his band.

You don’t head for the bus stop so much as drift there. Your bag strap is biting your shoulder, and Mom’s house looms behind you.

You still don’t know many people in Bakersfield yet. Other than Jon, you’re only really friends with Beth.

Her voice filters through your mind: “You can crash on my couch.”

The 14 chugs to the curb, and you climb on. The morning commuters are all staring out the windows like they’re tired of their own lives. You hop off near Beth’s squat little apartment building. 

When you get there, you have to psych yourself up for a minute before you can even buzz her suite.

No answer. You can’t bring yourself to try again. Her car is in its stall, but that doesn’t mean she’s home. She could just be dead to the world. It’s still early.

You circle the block once, twice, then sink into the swings at a small park. The chains groan when you sit. You swing lazily, feeling a little forlorn. You scuff your toes through the sand and think about Beth’s offer again.

You feed quarters into a payphone, trying not to get your hopes up.

“It’s 6 AM. What do you want?” Beth’s voice is a snarl, even through the staticky connection.

“Uh, it’s Stevie. That offer for your couch still good?”

“Oh, shit. Just… give me twenty minutes to rejoin the living.”

You get there in ten. You wait another fifteen before you buzz up.

When Beth pulls her door open, her hair is a bird’s nest. 

“You look like shit. You get evicted?”

She steps back to let you in. Her eyes are barely more than slits.

“Nah, I evicted myself, actually,” you say, kicking your boots off into the closet.

She slides the chain back home and gestures vaguely toward the couch before shuffling back to her room.

“Mi casa, su casa. I’m going back to bed.”

You flop onto the cushions, nerves too wired for sleep. The couch smells like Beth: incense and cigarette smoke. One of her cats vaults onto your chest, kneading you aggressively before settling with a purr that rattles your ribcage.

You scratch her chin. She head-butts your jaw, unbothered by whatever weight you’re carrying. Finally, you start to relax.

You both have a shift at 10:00, and you’re ready to go when Beth re-emerges from her room.

For the next two days, you keep your bag by the door. You don’t want to overstay your welcome, so you try not to take up too much space. You make yourself useful. You do dishes, scoop the cat litter. You offer to make lasagne, your ‘specialty’.

After your shower on Wednesday morning, the cats are circling your legs, weaving between them like they’re trying to kill you. Beth’s perched on the kitchen counter in a sleep shirt, smoking and nursing what has to be yesterday’s coffee.

“You get up way too fucking early,” she says bluntly. She flicks her ash into a chipped mug. “So. What’s the plan, kid? You gonna sleep on the couch forever?”

You mutter something about figuring it out.

Beth snorts, hops down, and tosses the classifieds onto the kitchen table. It lands with a slap.

“You’ve crashed long enough,” she says, stretching her arms overhead. “Might as well split the ’lectric bill. The cats have accepted you as furniture anyway.”

Beth points with her cigarette. “Circle a couple dumps we can actually afford. We’ll go look. If you want. This place sucks, anyway.”

She ruffles your damp hair as she passes, heading to the living room.

The cats jump onto the table, paws flattening the newsprint while you fish a pen out of the drawer. You scratch stars in the margins next to addresses you don’t recognize, apartments described in short sentences: 2BR, cheap. 3rd fl, no W/D. You have to decode the listings like hieroglyphs.

It feels unreal. Like you’re writing something into existence with each pen mark. Choosing instead of being trapped. You hardly know where to start. 

You’d call Jon, but it’s probably too early. You haven’t been able to catch him since you left your mom’s. You go back to the rent ads.

You circle a couple of possibilities before joining Beth on the couch as she takes a huge bong rip. She’s watching some old sword and sorcery movie from the 80s. Wordlessly, she hands you the bong, blowing a stream of smoke toward the ceiling. 

You take a hit, holding it in until your eyes water. You pass the bong back to Beth, coughing harshly. 

You manage to croak, “What are you watching?”

“Red Sonja. It’s fucking terrible, but in the best way.”

You settle into the sofa, eyes on the screen. You can call Jon later.

“I love this wizard shit.”

One movie bleeds into the next, and the phone is the farthest thing from your mind. The rest of the day is a haze.

Work is uneventful. You’re nearing the end of your shift on Thursday when a sharp knock on the swinging door startles you out of autopilot. You look up to see Jon peering at you from the store floor. He looks annoyed. You wave him back with a pit in your stomach.

“So,” he says, “are you avoiding me or something?”

You eye him warily, leaning your hip against the sorting table.

“What? No, not on purpose, anyway. I’ve just been kind of busy,” you say lamely.

“Busy, sure. Your mom came looking for you at my place, y’know. Thought I’d die of shock when I saw her on the steps.”

That surprises you. You don’t know what to do with that information, so you shove it aside. You’ll process it later.

“Yeah, well, it was pretty spur of the moment. I had to get the hell out. Couldn’t take her anymore.”

“Okay, but a little heads-up might have been nice. You didn’t think to let me know where you’re at?”

God damn it, life was easier when nobody gave a shit.

“Look, I’m sorry. For real. I wasn’t sure if my impending homelessness was above your pay grade or not. I mean, I did try calling, I was just never able to catch you.”

Jon laughs drily at that, his expression softening slightly.

“Try a little harder next time, Stevie. I don’t like being left out, alright?”

You look away, feeling guilty. You notice Carl’s office door is propped open, and he’s watching you and Jon with unabashed interest.

“Alright, I should stop slacking,” you say as you turn back to Jon. “I’ve got another 45 minutes. Meet me after, and I’ll give you the dirt.”

Jon’s eyes flick over your shoulder to Carl’s office. 

“Yeah, alright, see you at 4:00.”

With that, he’s out the door.

You grimace as you tear another bag open. He might as well have hit you with ‘I’m not mad, just disappointed’. 

Your stomach coils with unease. You’ve spent your entire life trying not to let anyone down. Your success rate is low and dropping fast.

At 4:00, you grab your bag and tell Beth you’re gonna hang with Jon. She waves you off with a wink. 

You try not to dawdle. You know you should give Jon an explanation, but you’d just rather not.

He’s smoking in his car with the windows down. The Cure is playing when you climb into the passenger seat.

“Hey,” you say quietly. “You still mad at me?”

He takes one last drag of his cigarette, exhaling heavily through his nose. He stubs the butt out in the ashtray. 

“I wasn’t mad, Stevie. But sometimes it’s like pulling teeth getting you to talk to me.”

Jon drums his fingers on the steering wheel.

“Can I ask where you’re staying, or is that top secret?”

The guilt trip shit is getting old quick, but you let it go.

“I’m staying with Beth, who else? We might actually get a place together.”

Jon quirks an eyebrow. 

“You and Beth, huh? That tracks.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

“Nothing. Just… don’t forget I’m here too, alright?”

Jon flicks his wrist, turning the key in the ignition. He catches your eye in the rearview.

“So, where to?”

You pause, considering your options. 

“Hmm. I’d rather not go to your place for obvious reasons. Wanna just drive for a bit?”

You watch Bakersfield roll by your window. Jon’s hand finds yours on the seat. He asks if you know how to drive.

“Barely,” you chuckle wryly. “I mostly skipped Driver’s Ed. It was Des Moines, where would I go, anyway?”

“Literally anywhere else,” Jon snickers.

“Touché. So, what, you wanna teach me?”

“Might as well. You gotta learn sometime.”

Jon turns into the next empty parking lot he finds. He throws the car in park, circling the hood to open your door.

“You ever drive stick?” 

He offers you his hand, pulling you out of the car. 

“No, so be nice.”

He grins wickedly.

“No promises.”

You get situated behind the wheel, pulling the seat closer. 

Jon gives you the basic rundown of the pedals. Clutch, gas, brake. You try not to get too cranky when you keep grinding gears.

“Fuck, you really can’t drive for shit.” He laughs like it’s adorable.

“It’s a lot to handle, okay?” you snap, then laugh. “Smug prick.”

Jon catches your hand when you swat at him and squeezes your fingers affectionately. He scoots closer on the seat.

“You work the clutch and I’ll shift, okay?”

You quit once you manage to circle the lot twice without stalling. You try to tamp down the usual frustration that comes when you don’t immediately nail something.

“Alright, I’m fuckin’ done. I’m doomed to take the bus forever.”

Jon snorts and pats your knee with mock sympathy. 

“Chill. It was your first time. But sure, we can be done for now.”

You switch seats, relieved.  

Jon starts to drive again. The city thins into scrub. He turns down a grid road, the car rattling over the gravel. He pulls into a turnoff for an oil field. The pumpjacks bow like a congregation, their slow, metallic creaks filling the silence.

Jon kills the engine, and the tape dies with it.

When you roll the windows down, the air smells like oil and dust. 

“You ready to talk yet?” 

You spit it out in bits, like broken glass.

“Finding that note was the last straw.”

The machines nod as if they know all about it.

“She and I got into it. I was all shitfaced and I wouldn’t back down.”

You clear your throat, your mouth tastes like mud. 

“Then one night she cornered me in the kitchen, dumped all this shit on me. Little stuff at first, like how I look like him when I sleep.”

You take the cigarette Jon offers, smoke unfurling in your lungs. Your voice is a little thicker when you start again.

“Basically, Dad offing himself destroyed her and I’m just this constant reminder. Something about how it’s like he’s haunting her through me.”

You take another drag, eyes flicking at Jon. 

“All my life,” you say as you exhale, “I’ve wanted her to tell me about him, but she kept it clutched to her chest like some kind of fucking secret.“

Bitterness washes over you, prickling behind your eyes. You flick some ash out the window, watching the flecks flutter to the ground. 

“The cherry on top was when she said she knew what Larry was doing. She acted all hurt and surprised when the truth came out, but she knew all along.”

You scoff, stubbing out your smoke.

“She acts like she gave me some big gift. Like moving here and telling me a couple stories about my old man makes up for an entire life of nothing.”

The words are spilling out now, filled with bile.

“I packed my shit and left. I’m tired of her pushing me away like I’m the root of everything bad in her life. I’m done acting like I’m fine with whatever scraps she gives me.“

A tear rolls down your cheek, you swipe at it angrily like your body has betrayed you.

Jon doesn’t say anything for a minute. He fidgets with his lighter as he digests what you told him. 

“It’s not your fault she’s fucked up, Stevie.”

“Yeah? Tell that to her,” you say bitterly. “Tell her I’m not his fucking ghost.”

Your jaw snaps shut like you’ve said too much.  You bite your tongue. Enough word-vomit.

“I don’t care what she sees,” Jon says. “I know who I’m looking at.”

The words sit there, heavier than the machinery, bigger than the hole in your chest. It’s a dangerous thing to let someone see your rotten insides. You’ve let Jon see more than most, and he still hasn’t looked away.

You make yourself relax, but you still can’t quite meet his eye. You try to brush it off.

“It sounds like nothing when I say it out loud.”

The sun starts to dip below the horizon. Jon reaches across the seat and pulls you closer.

“It’s not nothing when it’s yours. You could have told me, Stevie. You don’t need to keep it all to yourself.”

He reaches up to brush some hair behind your ear. The gesture is surprisingly gentle. 

“I know all about shitty parents. I told you about my Dad, remember? I get it. Maybe your mom didn’t make a habit of slapping your ass around, but she still left you bruised.”

You hesitate.

“I don’t want to overload you with this shit. It’s fucking non-stop with me lately. Plus, it’s a boner-killer when your sorta girlfriend is crying all the time.”

He grunts.

“Look, I’m not always good at emotions or whatever, but you gotta let me try. And there’s no ‘sorta’ about it.”

Then he’s got your chin, turning your face toward his. His lips are warm when they brush against yours.

“You better not have some kind of damsel kink,” you mutter.

“Christ, Stevie,” he pulls back. “I’m trying to be nice here.” 

“Well then, I guess it wouldn’t do to piss off my driving instructor.”

“Just promise to let me know next time. Before you blow this place for good.”

The pumpjacks are still nodding like they think that sounds fair. You nod too, and you mean it.

“You sure you don’t wanna come back to my place? If your mom’s home, I can just take you straight to Beth’s.”

“Sounds reasonable.”

Jon starts the car, the engine a low hum. By the time you get back, it’s dusk. Her porch light is on but it doesn’t look like she’s home.

He walks you to his door like he’s escorting a hostage, chest pressed against your back. 

“Mission accomplished,” you whoop, slamming the door.

Twitch doesn’t look up from the TV.

“You two make the worst ninjas I’ve ever seen.”

Jon snickers and ushers you toward his room. He flops onto his bed, pulling you down with him. You land on top of him with an ‘oof’. He wraps his arms around you when you try to roll off.

You tug one of his dreads as he smirks up at you. 

“You could stay, you know.”

“I could. A night off from the couch might be nice.”

Jon holds you tighter.

“I see how it is,” he teases. “You just want me for my bed.”

“Yup, you’ve got me all figured out.”

You disentangle yourself, moving back toward the door.

You use the phone in the kitchen, looking through the window at your mom’s backyard. Your hammock waves sadly under the apple tree.

When you say you’re crashing at Jon’s, Beth cackles gleefully. 

“I appreciate you not bringing him back here to knock boots. The cats would be scandalized.”

You choke back a laugh of your own.

“There will be no boot-knocking,” you half-snarl down the line.

“Keep telling yourself that,” she laughs. 

“Whatever, asshole. I’m hanging up now.”

Beth is still laughing when you drop the receiver back on the cradle.

Chimp has joined Twitch in the living room. He whistles loudly when you head toward Jon’s room.

“Atta boy, JoJo!”

You flip him off, but you file the stupid nickname away for later.

You shut the door behind you, leaning against it. Jon lit a candle while you were gone.

You eye him as he lounges against the headboard. He’s all dimples and mock-affront as you arch an eyebrow.

“What?”

“You think a scented candle is all it’s gonna take?”

“Oh, that? Nah, that’s just a little ambiance. Unless?”
 
You drop back onto the mattress.

“Not gonna happen. Not with Twitch and Chimp, like, twelve feet away.”

“Alright, alright,” he surrenders. “Note taken.”

You snuggle closer anyway, kissing him lightly.

The unspoken ‘soon’ hangs between both of you.",1,1758249797.0,u_ScenicAbattoir,0,1.0,False

1nkrvfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/gowildfrontier/comments/1nkrvfs/trip_report_seattle/,Trip Report: Seattle,"Went over to Seattle for the weekend as my first time using the Frontier Go Wild service since signing up during this month's promo period. I had previously flown Frontier regularly before as well as Spirit in the ULCC category, but remembered Frontier had issues generating my QR code while checking in using their desktop website. Lesson I got from that frustrating experience was make sure as hell to get a QR code boarding pass while checking in 24 hours before departure.

There are two flights I missed on trip, both I attributed it to myself for being at the mercy of mass transit and being stubborn in getting to the airport as cheaply as possible by giving myself what I thought was a reasonable amount of time. I missed my flight from JFK on Thursday and flew the same flight on Friday to LAS. Gate agent was able to rebook me to Fri for free. After missing my gate closure by 5 mins, I gave myself a half hour more time the next day but this was risky since the security line was much longer on Friday 7am. Luckily more gates were open Friday and things went smoothly, I got to my gate with almost twenty minutes to spare. I learned that I needed to give myself just about an entire hour before departure to be at the airport, any less time than that and you can also have another large group of passengers from the next set of flights massing through airport security in front of you.

I had a four hour layover in LAS. But I had forgotten my phone charger. I risked it again and decided to go all the way into the Marshall's on the strip to get a new charger instead of paying fifty bucks at the airport. I took the 109 bus to deuce bus to get some food and buy that charger for less than fifteen. Then reversed it back to the airport. Ten dollars for the sandwich I bought and ten bucks total on bus transit, for a grand total of thirty five bucks. One hour on the strip, two hours on the buses. Made it back to the airport with an hour to spare, got through security no problems, flight departed on time and arrived in Seattle 4pm, no problems. 

I did all the tourist things in Seattle. Rode the train into the city, Rode the monorail and had lunch at the armory by the space needle, Went to Pike marketplace, walked inside the starbucks, walked along the waterfront. Saw sunset at the Columbia Skyview building. Went to Chinatown district for dinner. This was going to be originally a one night trip and I was going to leave tomorrow morning so I got a hotel by the airport and slept. My flight in the morning was at 7am to DEN and then to LGA. But I missed this flight too by not giving myself more time, I waited around for the hotel shuttle and probably could've made it by just walking but I got there late and missed by flight by five minutes again. The gate agent was nice, was able to rebook me again for same flight tomorrow without cost to DEN. I also got the phone number at DEN to see if they can book my connection back to LGA for free, but I just paid the fifteen to do it through the app as part of the go wild program. I commiserated with other people who missed their departures and then went about planning my second day in Seattle. 

With the unexpected second day in Seattle, I dropped off my bags at a much cheaper hotel near the airport. I went into the city, visited Pioneer district, had breakfast there hanging around a lot of the unhoused peoples. Then I took the bus over to Discovery park and did a three mile loop hike which took me probably two hours with some excursions. My legs were super tired and I used my AMC A-List pass at the mall in the city to watch a movie. It helped me a lot to recover from all the walking the past two days. I got some great scallop clam chowder at the same mall. Walked around downtown some more, went to the other mall and then went to the sphere Amazon HQ. Nice architecture outside, but they only allowed the public in to one room inside and got to see their corpse flower and tanks of poisonous frogs. Pretty cool. Before heading back to my hotel, I went up to the Washington University fountain and had a great moment of rest watching the world go by. A mother and young toddler sat next to me on the bench, and the baby got real excited for a dog that passed by in front of the fountain. On train back downtown, I was crowded into a car filled with Mariner fans and loved the energy. I was actually really glad my flight got missed and I got to spend a second day in the city.

Next day Sunday, I gave myself plenty of time getting to the airport. My budget hotel sucked but it was a short fifteen minute walk to security. Went through, took the train to my gate and got on the flight to Denver without problems. Landed in Denver and immediately went downtown on their A train after using the bathroom. Of all the airports this was the one where I had the most time and most things to do but I still wanted to leave and spend three hours downtown. I got my coffee at the other end in the Union Station, walked around the 16th street mall, walked over to the convention center which had a cool blue bear looking thorugh the glass building architecture, walked over to McGregor Square and almost decided to just have lunch there watching football, it was such a good vibe. But I had made waitlist reservations at a ramen restaurant and walked five minutes back to enjoy the excellent noodles. Went back on the train, got to the airport. Denver airport security is the least consistent. First airport security I ran into where I had issues with my belt and they made me take it off. Made it to my gate. Frontier flight was scheduled to depart loading from both sides of the plane from the ground staircases. It was delayed though some peopel were partially seated, while me and the rest of the folks just stood in line outside basking in the sunburn. All the while I got text updates telling me gates were being changed but the attendants didn't respond. Finally switched to another plane, reboarded and departed a hour and a half later. Made it home to LGA an hour after scheduled, took the bus home and fell fast asleep.

Very adventureous weekend. Spent altogether \~700. Flights, food, hotels, transportation all in. Kept cool and rolled with the punches, some of which I inflicted on myself. Glad I did it and still thinking about it days later. I'd say if I can get one more trip out of go wild it'd be worth it on it's own, but think to have more than a year worth of travelling available is an incredible value. It's exhausting and I wouldn't want to travel every weekend but it allows me to see parts of the country and cities I normally wouldn't consider.",3,1758249570.0,gowildfrontier,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Doosan Bears vs. SSG Landers: A Tale of Underdogs, Strikeouts, and the World’s Most Confident Spread**  
*By Your Friendly Neighborhood Sportswriter Who Still Can’t Throw a Curveball*

---

**Parsing the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even if you hate math, *these* numbers are entertaining. The SSG Landers are the heavy favorites here, with implied win probabilities hovering around **57-58%** (thanks to decimal odds of 1.43-1.45). Meanwhile, the Doosan Bears are the underdogs, priced between **2.7 and 2.86**, translating to **26-36%** implied chances. To put that in layman’s terms: SSG is the guy who aced calculus in high school, and Doosan is the guy who “aced” by cheating off his calculator watch.

The spread? Doosan is getting **+1.5 runs**, with odds hovering near **1.8-1.9**. That means bookmakers think SSG should win by more than a single run, but Doosan’s “handicap” feels like giving a toddler a head start in a race against Usain Bolt. Still, the total runs line is set at **9.5**, with even money on Over/Under. If you’re betting on “Over,” you’re banking on a fireworks show; “Under” is your bet that these teams will stage a tense, pitcher’s duel worthy of a Korean drama.

---

**Digesting the News: Star Power, Future Pros, and a Lot of Kids’ Dreams**  
Doosan’s recent headlines are all about Hanyang University’s baseball program—specifically, two of their players, **Seo Jun-Oh** and **Sim Geon-bo**, getting drafted in the 2026 KBO draft. Seo, a fireballing sophomore with a 153 km/h fastball, is the kind of pitcher who makes you forget about your coffee. Sim, a senior with a .327 average and national team experience, is the kind of hitter who could probably bat .400 if he just stopped tripping over his own feet. But here’s the catch: *they’re still in college*. Their presence in Doosan’s system is a future asset, not a current one. For this game, though, Doosan’s roster includes **Yang Eui-ji**, who’s nominated for the CGV Scene-Stealer Award for a cycling hit that would make a Tour de France cyclist blush.

SSG, meanwhile, is riding the legacy of **Kim Kwang-hyun**, who recently became only the third KBO pitcher to reach 2,000 career strikeouts in the fewest games ever. That’s like being the third person in history to climb Mount Everest… but you

Is there anything I can do to fix it?,"I tried posting this in the dead bedrooms subreddit but it got removed by the moderators so I’m seeking advice here instead. 

My wife and I have been together 17 years and married for 10. 

I made some really stupid choices before we got married and she hasn’t been able to get past them. 

Soon after she moved in with me I went to a topless coffee shop with my single coworkers. At the time, I knew it was wrong but had the attitude of “what she doesn’t know, won’t hurt her” I drunkenly started telling my friends about it at a party and didn’t realize she had overheard me. She asked me about it the next day and I lied about going. Then she said she was disappointed not only that I went, but that I lied when confronted since she already knew the truth. She said she wasn’t sure if she wanted to continue the relationship but I begged her to stay and promised I wouldn’t lie to her again. She agreed to stay. 

Then a few years later, after work I stopped by the grocery store to pick up a few items and saw this stunningly sexy woman and stupidly IM’d my friend about how she was my perfect type. My wife (gf back then) and I shared a computer at home and she was on the computer when I sent those messages and she saw them in real time. When I got home, she confronted me and I apologized. She said she felt like her self esteem was shattered by those comments and wasn’t sure if she could ever feel attractive around me again. I explained that I’m not blind and will find other women attractive but that doesn’t mean I’m not attracted to her as well. That was the beginning of our dead bedroom. She stopped wearing lingerie and instigated sex way less often. 

Then after we got engaged and were planning our bachelor and bachelorette parties I asked how she would feel if I went to a strip club. She said she wasn’t comfortable given my history and asked me not to. I agreed to not go. But once I was in Vegas, my friends peer pressured me and I went anyways. I came clean to her on the phone that night since I felt bad keeping that information from her. I also learned her friends were trying to pressure her to get male strippers at her party and she turned them down. I felt terrible I couldn’t show her the same level of loyalty. She was understandably very upset and asked to postpone the wedding until she could work through her feelings. We ended up getting married scheduled as planned. 

Even though the wedding was great she didn’t want to have sex that night explaining she was still hurt by my choice to go to a strip club so we didn’t do anything. I could tell she also still hadn’t recovered from my comments a couple years before the wedding since our sex life hadn’t got much better.  

After the wedding, she pulled away even more. It was like she no longer enjoyed sex whatsoever. She stopped having orgasms, I would offer to go down on her or use toys if my performance alone was no longer enough but she turned me down every time. She once said “I don’t mind sex, but I don’t want to feel like I need to have an orgasm” 

At that point I figured “time heals all wounds” and that eventually she would start wearing lingerie, initiating sex, and start having orgasms again but it’s been 10 years later and nothing has changed. 

I finally asked her last week if there’s anything I could say or do to change how she feels and she basically said “I’m still physically attracted to you. I’m still very much in love with you. But I’m not sure if I could ever feel that sexual chemistry again. I understand what you said and did was many years ago, but some wounds never heal. I don’t think I will ever feel attractive enough around you. I’m not trying to make you feel bad, since I know you’ve apologized many times, I’m just trying to explain my feelings. If I haven’t gained that sexual confidence back by now, I don’t think I will ever be able to again. I would be fine with never having sex again, but I understand it’s important to you so I do try to give that to you. I’m sorry it happens so rarely these days and I’d understand if that is a deal breaker for you” 

I truly love her with all my heart and I couldn’t imagine spending my life with someone else so I don’t have any plans to leave her. I just feel terrible about how my actions created this situation. If I could get a time machine and take back everything, I would in a heart beat, but there’s nothing I can do. It feels like there’s no fixing it. 

Did I screw up the relationship beyond repair? What could I do help her feel that chemistry with me again? 

I don’t want to leave her. Even if her views don’t change, I would still stay since she’s my best friend and life partner. 

TL:DR; I lied about going to a topless coffee shop. I once told a friend that a woman I saw (that wasn’t my wife) in public was my perfect type. I went to a strip club after agreeing not to go. All these things cumulated into my wife no longer having sexual attraction towards me. What, if anything, I could do to help her feel the chemistry again?

I'm an American ER Nurse with an active Kiwi nursing licenses who had a job offer in Dunedin before my mom's leukemia came roaring back and is now beyond even palliative chemotherapy. While I am spending as much time with her as we've got left, I decided to start chipping away at a Tom Clancy-esque technothriller featuring a war with China where the United States, overwhelmed by incompetent leadership and rising fascism (a stretch, I know), abandons Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and Taiwan while the PRC plans an invasion across the Taiwan Strait.

The RAN/JMSDF/Singapore/RNZN/etc aren't sidekicks waiting for American cavalry, they're the primary combatants because the US is more worried about policing its own people and funding laser hair removal for combat troops.

Honestly, it's been so bizarre to simply write factually true things and realize ten years ago I would've been mercilessly pilloried as being unhinged for even suggesting them.

While the RAN/JMSDF are the primary players, I obviously couldn't write this and not give New Zealand it's due. One of the conceits is that the JMSDF gave up two of their Kongo-class AEGIS destroyers to the RNZN so they could launch and staff their own, brand new ASEV ships, and that NZ would look for non-American military equipment if they had to re-arm.

The first book is coming out soon (it's setup to be a duology), but I don't want to break the promotion rules here, so no links, no titles. I just wanted paste in a few of the Kiwi chapters here so anyone who wanted to read what the Kiwis were doing could enjoy doing so for free for free. I'm also offering free virtual copies to any current/former NZDF folks who'd like one, just drop me a line.

Appreciate you!

# Chapter 4: The Brotherhood of the Mountains

**Alishan Mountains, Central Taiwan** 

**Elevation: 2,200m**

 *January 29th, 2027*

The rock face was turning to shit.

Captain Travis Malone pressed himself against the crumbling limestone, feeling the ancient stone flake away under his fingertips. Twenty meters below, the canopy of Taiwan's mountain forest stretched into gray mist, and twenty meters above, Sergeant Tamati Reihana was methodically setting new anchor points with the patient precision of someone who'd learned that rushing in the mountains got you killed.

""Rock quality's degrading fast,"" called Sergeant Hu from his position on the narrow ledge. The Taiwanese Ranger's English was clipped and precise, his voice carrying no hint of the fact that he was balanced on six inches of wet stone with a forty-pound sensor package strapped to his back. ""Weather's moving in from the west. Maybe thirty minutes before the real rain hits.""

Malone checked his wrist-mounted GPS. Signal intermittent, as expected under the dense canopy. The mission was simple in concept, nightmare in execution: plant a covert seismic and acoustic sensor package in the valley below, one of seventeen potential infiltration routes the intelligence analysts had identified. When the Chinese came—and everyone knew they were coming—this electronic ear would give the defenders precious minutes of early warning.

If they could get the damn thing to work.

Above them, Tamati's voice carried down with a trace of his Kiwi accent: ""Right, we're nearly sorted up here. But this moss is slick as owl shit, and the next bit's proper vertical. You yanks sure your kit can't phone home from down there?""

Sergeant Billy Kowalski, the detachment’s communications specialist, looked up from his ruggedized tablet with frustration written across his face. ""Negative. Too much canopy interference. I need line of sight to the bird, or this whole sensor package is just an expensive paperweight.""

The ""bird"" was a KH-11 reconnaissance satellite that would relay the sensor data back to Taiwanese defense networks. But satellites, for all their technological sophistication, still couldn't see through a solid wall of mountain forest.

Lightning flickered in the distance, followed by the low rumble of thunder. The storm was closing faster than predicted.

""There's one option,"" Hu said quietly, his voice barely audible over the wind picking up through the trees. He pointed to a razor-thin ridge barely visible through the mist, cutting up the mountainside like an old scar. ""That ridgeline. It crests above the treeline. You'd have clear sky.""

Malone studied the route through his binoculars. The path—if you could call it that—was little more than a series of handholds carved into vertical rock by decades of erosion. It looked like the kind of climb that separated the professionals from the corpses.

""Jesus,"" he muttered. ""How vertical are we talking?""

""It's not a path,"" Hu said matter-of-factly. ""It's a scar. Lost a conscript up there last year. Kid panicked halfway up, tried to rush the descent. Fell sixty meters into the ravine.""

Malone felt his stomach tighten. The mission was critical—without the sensor network, the defenders would be fighting blind when the invasion came. But asking his team to attempt a climb that had already killed someone...

""I can get you up there."" Tamati's voice came from above, where he'd finished rigging the anchor points. The New Zealand SAS sergeant rappelled down to their position with the fluid grace of someone who treated vertical rock like other people treated sidewalks. ""Won't be fun, but it's doable. Question is, how much time do you need once we're up there?""

Kowalski consulted his tablet. ""Satellite window opens in fifty minutes, lasts for maybe three minutes max. Miss that, and we're waiting eight hours for the next pass.""

""Bloody tight margins,"" Tamati observed, studying the route. ""But close is what we do, eh?""

Rain began to mist the valley, turning the already treacherous rock slick and deadly. Malone made the calculation every special operations leader learned to make: acceptable risk versus mission failure. The sensor had to be planted. Taiwan's survival might depend on the intelligence it provided.

""All right,"" he decided. ""We go up. Tamati takes point, Hu guides, Kowalski carries the package. I'll coordinate from here and track the satellite window.""

What followed was forty-five minutes of controlled terror.

Tamati led the ascent with the methodical precision of a man who'd cut his teeth on the vertical walls of Afghanistan's Hindu Kush. Every piton was placed with deliberate care, every rope tested twice. Behind him, Hu moved with the fluid confidence of someone climbing in his own backyard, occasionally calling out warnings about loose rock or hidden cracks that could trap an unwary hand.

Kowalski, carrying the sensor package, climbed with grim determination. The Navy SEAL-turned-Army communications specialist had done high-angle work before, but never with this much gear on this bad rock in deteriorating weather. When a rope anchor pulled loose fifteen meters up, threatening to send him tumbling into the void, Hu's instant counterbalance maneuver saved his life without either man saying a word about it.

Malone tracked their progress through his drone's camera feed, simultaneously monitoring the satellite approach on his tactical display. The margin for error was shrinking by the minute.

""Satellite window opens in ninety seconds,"" he called up. ""You've got three minutes to get the package online once the window hits, or we're screwed until tonight.""

""Copy that,"" Kowalski's voice was strained but steady. ""Almost at the crest.""

They crested the ridge with thirty seconds to spare, bursting above the treeline into clear sky just as Malone's tablet showed the KH-11 satellite would be approaching the optimal communication window. Rain lashed the exposed ridge, but Kowalski's fingers flew across his equipment with practiced efficiency.

""Signal acquired,"" he called down. ""Package is online and transmitting. We're in business, folks.""

Twenty minutes later, the sensor was planted in a concealed tree hollow, its micro-transponder beacon hidden but active. The electronic ear that might save Taiwan was listening.

That night, the three teams huddled in a waterproof shelter below the ridgeline, the air thick with the smell of wet gear and gun oil, sharing rations and the particular camaraderie that came from surviving something dangerous together. Tamati lit a tiny heating element to warm instant curry, the Americans broke out MREs, and the Taiwanese Rangers contributed steamed buns and concentrated tea that tasted like salvation after the day's exertions.

""You know,"" Malone said, accepting a cup of the Rangers' tea, ""I worked with a Kiwi operator in Kandahar. Crazy bastard rappelled down a grain silo during a dust storm to get a shot at an HVT. Never did catch his name.""

Tamati grinned, the expression transforming his weathered face. ""That'd be me, mate. Though 'crazy bastard' might be a bit generous. I prefer 'tactically flexible.'""

""Jesus Christ, that was you?"" Malone laughed, the sound echoing softly in their concealed position. ""Command was furious. Said you violated about fifteen safety protocols.""

""Got the target though, didn't we?"" Tamati's eyes twinkled with mischief. ""Sometimes you've got to improvise.""

Hu listened to the exchange with the quiet attention of someone learning about the wider world his country was now part of. His grandfather had fought at Kinmen in 1958, when Chinese Communist forces had tried to seize the offshore islands. The old man had told stories of desperate battles fought with outdated weapons against overwhelming odds, of young soldiers dying far from home for causes bigger than themselves.

Now his grandson was part of something different—a coalition of professionals who chose to stand together not because they had to, but because they believed it was right.

""This is good,"" Malone said, looking around at the group. American, New Zealander, Taiwanese—three nations that a year ago had barely coordinated their military exercises, now working together like they'd trained for years. ""When we work together like this, nothing can stop us. If the balloon ever goes up, we've got your back.""

He clapped Tamati on the shoulder with complete sincerity, the gesture carrying the weight of genuine commitment. These weren't just words—they were a promise between professionals who'd earned each other's respect the hard way.

Tamati paused, just for a beat, looking out through the shelter's opening at the valley below where their sensor now waited in digital silence. When he looked back, his smile was crooked, tinged with something that might have been prescience.

""Hope your politicians remember that when Beijing comes calling.""

The words hung in the mountain air like the mist rising from the valleys below—a quiet acknowledgment of the gap between what soldiers promised each other and what governments delivered. But in that moment, sharing warmth and food and the satisfaction of a mission accomplished, it felt like a gap that could be bridged.

In the distance, thunder rolled across the mountains of Taiwan, and the sensor they'd planted together listened to the night, waiting for the sound of invasion.

None of them knew that in just a few short weeks, the promises made in those mountains would be broken by men who'd never climbed a cliff face or trusted their lives to a teammate's rope work. 

The brotherhood forged in the Alishan peaks would survive.

The alliance would not.

**Chapter 15: The Merge**

**Above the Tasman Sea, near Norfolk Island**

*March 04, 2027 - 1430 Hours*

The sun flashed off the Flanker's canopy like a knife edge as Wing Commander Marcus ""Kahu"" Jones hauled back on the stick, his G-suit squeezing like a python around his legs. Nine Gs. His vision tunneled to a gray straw, but the bandit stayed glued to his six.

""Kahu Lead, defensive!"" he grunted into his mask, the words compressed by the crushing force on his chest. ""Tally one, six o'clock low!""

The enemy aircraft—visually identified as a J-11 Flanker—was a gray shark against the brilliant blue of the Pacific, maintaining perfect gun tracking position. Every instinct screamed at Kahu to break harder, but he'd already maxed out the KF-21's G-limiter. The airframe groaned beneath him, composite skin flexing against titanium bones.

Alarms screamed in his cockpit. The radar warning receiver painted threat vectors across his helmet-mounted display, but all that mattered was the gray shape growing larger in his mirrors, steady as death.

""Kahu Two, engaging defensive!"" His wingman's voice, tight with his own G-strain. ""Can't get a shot!""

The enemy pilot was good. Scarily good. Every defensive maneuver Kahu attempted—a hard break turn, an attempt to roll away—the Flanker perfectly matched, staying just outside of gun range but too close for Kahu to extend and reset.

Time to change the game.

Kahu slammed the throttles forward and pulled vertical, trading speed for altitude. The KF-21's twin F414 engines screamed, afterburners painting blue diamonds in his mirrors. For a moment, he thought he had it—the Boramae's thrust-to-weight ratio was supposed to be superior to the older Flanker design.

But the Chinese pilot followed him up like he was on rails. Whoever this bastard was, they understood energy management at a molecular level.

""Come on, *come on*,"" Kahu whispered, watching his airspeed bleed off. At the top of the climb, he'd have one chance—kick the rudder, hammer the nose over, try to reverse onto the Flanker's six.

The J-11 pilot read his mind. As Kahu's KF-21 hung at the apex, nose wavering on the edge of a stall, the Flanker had already rolled inverted, pulling through to maintain its perch high above him.

*Shit*.

Kahu rolled desperately, diving for speed, but he'd burned too much energy in the climb. The Flanker dropped onto his six like a hawk on a pigeon. He pulled the throttles back and popped the airbrake, hoping to force an overshoot—make the bandit fly past and reverse the tables.

The Flanker didn't take the bait. Instead, he pulled up into a high yo-yo, using his altitude advantage to maintain position while Kahu bled more precious energy.

His arms burned from fighting the stick. Sweat stung his eyes despite the climate control. The altimeter unwound through 3,000 feet—too low for another vertical maneuver. The ocean filled his peripheral vision, brilliant and merciless.

Only one option left. Kahu rolled hard left, then immediately reversed right, beginning a desperate defensive scissors. Back and forth, each reversal tighter than the last, trying to make it impossible for the enemy to achieve a firing solution. The horizon spun crazily—ocean, sky, ocean, sky.

But the J-11 pilot was patient, expertly matching each reversal, waiting for the inevitable—that moment when Kahu would run out of airspeed, altitude, and options.

It came at 1,500 feet.

Kahu's final reversal was sluggish, the KF-21 wallowing as he demanded more than physics would allow. Through his canopy, he saw the Flanker's nose track smoothly onto him. He was out of energy, out of altitude, out of ideas.

The missile warning system shrieked. But instead of the expected radar lock, his headset filled with a different call:

""GUNS, GUNS, GUNS!""

Simulated cannon tracers flashed past his canopy, the aircraft's computer systems painting glowing death across his vision. His main display flashed red with bold text:

**== SIMULATED KILL ==** **== KNOCK IT OFF, KNOCK IT OFF ==**

The tension broke like a snapped cable. Kahu eased pressure on the stick, let his speed build back up, and took his first full breath in what felt like hours. His G-suit deflated with a wheeze.

The ""J-11"" pulled smoothly alongside, and Kahu couldn't help but laugh. It wasn't a Flanker at all—it was a Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18F Super Hornet in aggressor gray, its two-man crew visible through the bubble canopy. The pilot gave him a cheerful thumbs-up while the weapons systems officer in the back seat held up five fingers.

Five kills. Christ.

An unmistakably Australian accent crackled over the radio. ""You owe me a slab of Tui for that one, Kahu. Thought you had me in the vertical, ya sneaky bugger.""

Kahu rolled his shoulders, working out the knots. ""Almost did, Dingo. If this thing had the full software suite unlocked, you'd be the one swimming home.""

The Aussie pilot—Squadron Leader Connor ""Dingo"" McDuff—laughed. ""Yeah, yeah. You handle that Boramae well, but it's still no match for a Super Hornet when I'm flying a Flanker profile. Seriously though, mate, for a country that hasn't had fighters since we were both listening to Shaggy, where'd you learn to fly like that?""

""Air New Zealand, mate!"" Kahu allowed himself a small smile as he formed up on the Super Hornet's wing. ""You ever flown the approach into Queenstown in a 737? This was way easier!"" He paused, then added, ""Though the six years at Coningsby didn't hurt before Wellington called us all home to rebuild 75 Squadron.""

The Aussie WSO chimed in. ""Bloody hell, a Typhoon driver. That explains the energy management.""

""Mum's from Canterbury, dad's from Yorkshire,"" Kahu continued. ""Could have stayed with the RAF, but when your country needs pilots..."" He shrugged. ""Seemed like the right time to serve the homeland proper.""

The Aussie WSO chimed in. ""Heard you Kiwis have been running night intercepts against P-8s to get your radar hours up. That's proper dedication, mate.""

""When you've only got eighteen jets for the whole country,"" Kahu replied, checking his fuel state, ""you make every sortie count.""

As they maneuvered for the next engagement, Norfolk Island passed beneath them—a green dot in endless blue. Once a prison colony, now just another flyspeck in the Pacific. Kahu wondered if it would matter again in whatever was coming. The Chinese exercises had been growing larger each month, their ships pushing further south, testing boundaries and responses.

""Kahu Lead, Control,"" his radio crackled. ""RTB for you and your flight. Tanker will be on station in thirty mikes for your trip home.""

""Roger, Control. Kahu flight, knock it off, knock it off. Form on me for recovery.""

The six KF-21s of his detachment appeared from various altitudes and aspects, joining up in a loose tactical formation. Some waggled their wings—the traditional fighter pilot salute for a good fight. They'd been up against a full squadron of Australian Super Hornets and F-35s, and while they'd taken their lumps, they'd given almost as good as they got.

\----------

An hour later, Kahu walked into his office at RNZAF Base Ohakea, still wearing his sweat-stained flight suit. His legs felt rubbery from the G-forces, and his shoulders ached, but it was a good hurt—the kind that meant you'd pushed yourself and your machine to the limit and survived.

A red-bordered folder waited on his desk, ""EYES ONLY"" stamped across its face.

He broke the seal and read the deployment order twice, his post-flight euphoria evaporating like contrails over hot tarmac.

Twelve of his eighteen KF-21 Boramaes were to deploy immediately to Naha Air Base, Japan. They would join HMNZS *Aotearoa*—one of New Zealand's new *Kongo*\-class destroyers—and the frigate HMNZS *Te Kaha* in establishing a forward presence as part of the coalition's northern defensive line.

Twelve jets. Two-thirds of their entire fighter force.

On his desk, a photo caught his eye—his daughter Aria's fifth birthday party last month. She wore a tiny flight suit he'd had made for her, complete with RNZAF wings, her gap-toothed grin beaming as she blew out candles shaped like airplanes. She'd insisted on the aviation theme, proudly telling everyone her dad flew the ""fastest planes in all of New Zealand.""

He folded the deployment order once, slid it into his flight bag, and reached for his phone.

""Miri,"" he said when his wife answered. ""Remember when we talked about if I had to go away for work?""

A pause. He could hear her breathing change, the way it did when she was processing bad news. ""The jets?""

""Yeah. The jets.""

""How long?""

""I don't know. Maybe months."" Through his office window, he could already see ground crews prepping aircraft for long-range ferry flights. Red intake covers coming off. Fuel trucks rolling. ""I leave in thirty-six hours.""

""Japan?""

""Yeah. Naha."" Eight thousand kilometers from home. The furthest the RNZAF had deployed combat aircraft since Korea.

Another pause. Then, with forced brightness: ""Aria will want to see the photos. I know she's wanted to see Mount Fuji.""

""I'll send her pictures. Every day if I can.""

""Marcus..."" Her voice dropped. ""It's really happening, isn't it? What everyone's been worried about?""

He thought about the intelligence briefings, the satellite photos of Chinese naval bases, the submarine contacts that appeared and vanished like ghosts in the deep Pacific. The carefully worded diplomatic protests that accomplished nothing.

""I don't know, Miri. But my job is to make sure that whatever happens, it stays up there... and doesn't reach you and Aria.""

After he hung up, Kahu sat alone in his office, watching the organized chaos on the flight line. Weapons were already being loaded—Meteors and IRIS-Ts replacing the training rounds they'd carried today.

The games were over.

**Chapter 20: Raptor Down**

***Combat Information Center, JS*** **Amaterasu**

*East China Sea*

*March 29th, 2027 - 1900 Hours Local Time*

The CIC of Japan's most advanced destroyer existed in perpetual twilight. Banks of displays cast their blue glow across faces trained to find patterns in chaos, to transform electronic noise into tactical understanding. The air recycling system hummed at precisely the frequency that promoted alertness without fatigue—a detail the ship's designers had spent months perfecting.

Commodore Anna Reid stood before the main holographic plot, watching the task force move through the darkening waters of the East China Sea. Four ships against an ocean of uncertainty. The display rendered them as neat blue icons—*Amaterasu* at the center, her own *Aotearoa* two miles to starboard, the Japanese *Maya*\-class destroyer *Haguro* maintaining station to port, and the frigate *Te Kaha* ranging ahead on anti-submarine patrol.

Reid still wasn't used to calling the destroyer *Aotearoa*—for forty years that name had belonged to a tanker, and the old salts hadn't been quiet about the rechristening. But Parliament had insisted: the name carried too much *mana* to retire with a supply ship.

Beside her, Captain Kenji Tanaka studied the display, marking positions in his notebook with precise, economical strokes. Fourteen hours on watch and his uniform remained immaculate, his posture unchanged. Etajima training died hard.

""Your ship's processing power is remarkable, Captain,"" Reid said, her New Zealand accent softening the formal words. She gestured to a subsidiary display showing the data flow between vessels. ""My people on *Aotearoa* are seeing a clearer tactical picture than they've ever had. It's like someone cleaned our glasses after years of squinting.""

Tanaka inclined his head slightly. ""The ASEV was designed for this purpose, Commodore. To be the brain while our escorts are the sword and shield.""

Reid studied the display. At the turn of the decade, this level of cooperation would have been impossible—not technically, but politically. But then, there would have been American ships at the center of this formation, American aircraft providing the outer screen, American satellites feeding them real-time intelligence.

Three years. Might as well be three centuries.

""Speaking of threats,"" Reid said quietly, ""the latest intelligence from our friends was... sobering.""

She didn't need to specify which friends. Someone, somewhere in the American system, was still fighting their own war against paralysis.

""The winter exercises grow less ‘theoretical’ by the hour,"" Tanaka agreed. On the main plot, a new overlay appeared showing Chinese naval positions. The *Fujian* carrier group, pride of the PLAN, maintaining position ninety miles northwest. Two Type 055 destroyers had joined her yesterday. ""They're not even pretending anymore.""

A soft chime drew their attention. Lieutenant Commander Kimura, the ship's Tactical Action Officer, looked up from his console. ""Captain, Commodore, we're ready to begin the evening's defense drill whenever you give the word.""

Tanaka glanced at Reid. As the senior officer, the decision was hers, though both knew these drills had ceased to be theoretical exercises weeks ago. Now they were dress rehearsals for a performance nobody wanted to give.

""Execute,"" Reid ordered.

The CIC transformed. What had been quiet watchstanding became controlled urgency as the computers began generating virtual threats. The main plot filled with hostile tracks—bombers launching from mainland bases, missiles rising from ships over the horizon, submarines maneuvering for torpedo attacks. All simulated, all precisely modeled on Chinese capabilities, all terrifyingly plausible.

""Vampire, vampire, vampire,"" Kimura announced, his voice carrying the calm of hundred repetitions. ""Multiple cruise missiles, bearing three-two-zero, angels five, speed five hundred knots. Count is twenty-plus and rising.""

Reid watched Tanaka work, noting how he processed information from multiple sources simultaneously. A junior officer reported ESM hits from the simulated bombers. Another tracked the computer-generated submarine. The ship's Weapons Control Officer calculated firing solutions. Through it all, Tanaka stood perfectly still, absorbing the chaos and transforming it into order.

""TAO,"" Tanaka said quietly, ""vector the CAP to intercept the bomber stream. Heading zero-eight-five, angels high. Weapons free at forty miles.""

Kimura's fingers danced across his console. In seconds, he'd transformed Tanaka's order into precise targeting data, packaged it for transmission, and sent it racing through the electromagnetic spectrum to find its recipient thirty thousand feet above them.

""Kahu flight, this is Samurai Control,"" Kimura said in accented but clear English. ""Vector zero-eight-five for multiple bandits, angels three-five. You are cleared hot. Repeat, you are cleared hot.""

On the display, four blue icons representing the RNZAF fighters began their intercept vector. Four planes against a simulated regiment of bombers. In the real event, the math would be even worse.

**RNZAF KF-21 ""Kahu Lead""**

*30,000 feet above the East China Sea*

*1905 Hours*

Wing Commander Marcus ""Kahu"" Jones felt the KF-21 respond to his touch like a living thing, banking smoothly onto the new heading. Through his canopy, the last light of day painted the western horizon in shades of amber and blood. Below, the East China Sea was already surrendering to darkness, broken only by the navigation lights of distant merchantmen.

""Samurai Control, Kahu Lead,"" he responded, his Kiwi accent distinct even through the radio compression. ""Copy vector zero-eight-five. Kahu flight is proceeding.""

A few short years ago, he'd been ferrying tourists between Auckland and Sydney, complaining about roster changes and hotel coffee. Now he led four of his country's eighteen combat aircraft, holding the northern approach to a war everyone knew was coming.

*From airline pilot to the tip of democracy's spear,* he thought, checking his weapons panel. *Mum always said I'd do something important someday.*

The KF-21 was a good aircraft—not exceptional, but good. The Koreans and Swedes had designed it specifically to avoid American components, anticipating a world where U.S. export controls might become political weapons. That foresight now looked prophetic. 

""Lead, Two,"" came the voice of his wingman, Flight Lieutenant Emma Sinclair. ""I'm showing multiple contacts on datalink. Looks like regiment strength.""

Kahu studied his tactical display, marveling at the clarity of the picture being fed from *Amaterasu*. The Japanese ship's powerful radar and processing systems transformed raw data into tactical understanding, showing him exactly what he faced. In a real engagement, this picture would be the difference between life and death.

""Copy, Two. Looks like thirty-plus bandits."" He ran the mental math. Four fighters, each carrying six Meteors. Twenty-four missiles against thirty bombers, plus whatever escorts they'd have. ""Going to be busy.""

""Just like the Battle of Britain,"" Sinclair replied. ""Except we're the few and they're the many.""

""Right, so thirty-plus divided by four..."" Kahu made a show of counting on his fingers over the radio. ""That's only seven or eight each. Practically a milk run.""

""Plus escorts,"" Sinclair added dryly.

""Details, details. We'll just tell them to form an orderly queue. Very British of us.""

The datalink updated, showing the bombers' escort fighters moving to intercept. In the simulation, they were J-20s—China's premier stealth fighter. In reality, they'd be just as lethal and probably more numerous.

""Samurai Control, Kahu Lead,"" he called. ""Tally hostile fighters, bearing zero-nine-zero. Request clearance to engage escorts first.""

The response came immediately, the Japanese controller's calm voice a anchor in the tactical storm. ""Kahu Lead, Samurai Control. Cleared to engage at your discretion. Be advised, additional bomber stream detected bearing zero-seven-zero. *Haguro* is engaging with SM-2.""

More bombers. Always more bombers.

""Two, Three, you take the northern escorts. Four, you're with me on the southern group."" Kahu selected his first target, waiting for the tone that would indicate missile lock. ""Remember, people—this is what we trained for. Trust your aircraft, trust the controllers, trust each other.""

The HUD showed the range counting down. Forty miles. Thirty-five. At thirty, his first Meteor would have an almost certain probability of kill. In a real engagement, this would be the moment of truth—the second when eight years of commercial flying gave way to the warrior he'd trained to become.

""Fox Three,"" he called, thumbing the release. In the simulation, a missile left his rail, racing toward its virtual target. In reality, that same motion might soon send death across the evening sky.

The tactical display showed his missile tracking true, the simulated J-20 beginning evasive maneuvers that the computer calculated would probably fail. One bomber escort down, dozens more to go.

""Good kill, Lead,"" Samurai Control reported. ""Splash one bandit. Be advised, vampire launch from bomber formation. Multiple missiles inbound your position.""

And now the enemy was shooting back. Time to see if four Kiwis could dance between the raindrops.

""Kahu flight, defensive!"" He rolled the KF-21 inverted, pulling hard toward the deck. ""Notch and drag, people. Make them work for it.""

As g-forces crushed him into his seat, Kahu couldn't help but think about the absurdity of it all. Somewhere behind him, American pilots with better aircraft and more experience sat grounded by political cowardice. And here he was, a couple scant years removed from worrying about departure delays, fighting a simulated war that felt more real with every passing day.

The missile warning system screamed. Kahu broke hard left, dumping chaff and flares, trusting his life to Korean engineering and Swedish design.

Time to earn that flight pay.

**Officers' Club, Kadena Air Base, Okinawa** *1908 Hours*

Major Daniel ""Lunchbox"" Thompson stood at the window of what had once been the Raptor drivers' favorite watering hole, watching the lights of Naha Air Base twinkle in the distance. Eight miles. Might as well be eight thousand.

The club was nearly empty—most of the F-22 pilots couldn't stand to be here anymore, couldn't stand the weight of their own uselessness. But Thompson came every evening, drawn by the same masochistic impulse that made him pick at a sore tooth. He needed to watch the coalition aircraft launch. Needed to feel the shame burn fresh.

Behind him, three other Raptor pilots sat around a table that had once hosted boisterous Friday night gatherings. Now they nursed drinks in silence, occasionally glancing at the tactical display someone had jury-rigged to show the coalition exercise. Watching others do their job.

""Good kill, Kiwi,"" Thompson muttered, seeing one of the RNZAF KF-21s score a simulated victory against a J-20. The words tasted like ash.

Captain Mike ""Tuna"" Rodriguez slammed his glass down hard enough to slosh beer across the table. ""That's our kill, Lunchbox. Our. Fucking. Kill."" He gestured at the screen with barely controlled fury. ""We should be out there. Twenty-four Raptors sitting on this base. *Twenty-four*! We could establish air superiority over the entire strait in an afternoon. Instead, we're watching *sheep farmers* do it in something that came from IKEA. 'Insert tab A into slot B for your instant air force.'""

""Easy, Tuna,"" said Major Wendy ""Snapchat"" Duncan from her corner.

""Easy? ‘*Easy’*?!"" Rodriguez's voice cracked. ""I've got more hours in fighters than their entire fucking air force combined. And now they’re out there doing *our* job while we sit here with our dicks in our hands!"" Rodriguez snarled. He looked ready to throw his glass at the wall, maybe through it.

The door opened, admitting Colonel James Hartman, commander of the 525th Fighter Squadron. He looked like he'd aged five years in the past five months. The silver eagles on his shoulders might as well have been anchors for all the good they did him.

""Evening, sir,"" Thompson said, not quite meeting his commander's eyes.

Hartman surveyed the nearly empty club, the bitter faces, the tactical display showing allies doing the job his people trained for. ""Gentlemen. Lady."" He nodded to Duncan. ""I trust we're maintaining appropriate military bearing.""

""Just watching these folks get ready for the war we're not allowed to fight,"" Rodriguez said, not quite under his breath.

Hartman's jaw tightened, but when he spoke, his voice carried the same bitter frustration they all felt. ""Keep it together, Captain. The stand-down order comes directly from the Secretary of War, acting on Presidential authority."" He paused, and Thompson could see him wrestling with how much to say. ""Believe me, the entire chain of command has registered our... concerns.""

""Concerns,"" Duncan laughed, but there was no humor in it. ""Sir, I flew joint exercises with that Japanese controller. Kimura. Good man. Bought me sake after we kicked ass in Cope North. Now he's vectoring Kiwis instead of us because our leadership is too chickenshit to—""

""Major."" Hartman's voice cut like a blade. ""You will maintain proper respect for civilian authority. Regardless of... personal feelings.""

But Thompson caught the pause, the way Hartman's hands clenched. Their squadron commander was just as caged as they were, maybe more so. At least they could rage in private. He had to maintain the fiction of good order and discipline while everything they'd dedicated their lives to crumbled around them.

On the screen, the simulation showed the Kiwi fighters successfully breaking through the bomber stream, their Meteors finding targets with digital precision. Below them, the Japanese destroyers were engaging the cruise missiles, SM-2s racing out to intercept the sea-skimmers.

It was textbook fleet defense, exactly the scenario they'd trained for countless times. Except now the coalition was doing it without America's help. Doing it pretty well, actually, which somehow made it worse.

""You know what the real joke is?"" Thompson said, still staring out the window. ""Those KF-21s? They're good jets, but they're not Raptors. In a real fight, they'll take casualties. People are going to die because we're sitting here with our thumbs up our asses.""

""They know that,"" Hartman said quietly. ""They're flying anyway.""

The unspoken accusation hung in the air. 

Thompson's secure phone buzzed. He glanced at it, expecting another pointless admin message. Instead, he saw a text from Captain Yamamoto, a JASDF pilot he'd flown with during last year's exercises:

*Your Kiwi friends just completed perfect intercept. 4v30, killed 18 simulated bombers. Wish you were up here, brother.*

The casual cruelty of allies trying to include them, not understanding that every update was another twist of the knife.

""I need some air,"" Thompson announced, though the recycled atmosphere of the club was the same as outside. He just needed to be somewhere else, anywhere else.

As he headed for the door, he heard Rodriguez muttering to Duncan: ""Remember when we used to joke about being the tip of the spear? Turns out we're not even the fucking shaft.""

**Combat Information Center, JS** ***Amaterasu*** *1915 Hours*

The second wave of the simulation was more complex—cruise missiles launched from the surviving bombers, requiring a different defensive response. Where fighters excelled against aircraft, shipboard systems were designed to swat missiles from the sky.

""Vampire, vampire, vampire,"" Lieutenant Commander Kimura announced again, his voice maintaining the same professional calm. On the main display, dozens of red tracks appeared, racing toward the task force at wave-top height. ""Multiple sea-skimming cruise missiles. Count is forty-plus. Time to impact, four minutes.""

Commodore Reid watched Captain Tanaka orchestrate the defense. This was where the ASEV system truly shone—taking inputs from multiple radars, correlating tracks, and assigning optimal interceptors to each threat. What would have required minutes of radio coordination in years past now happened in seconds of digital precision.

""All ships, Samurai Control,"" Kimura broadcast. ""Weapons free. Engaging with SM-2. *Aotearoa*, you have tracks one-three through one-eight. *Haguro*, tracks one-niner through two-four. *Te Kaha*, stand by for leakers with Sea Ceptor.""

Reid felt a flush of pride as her ship acknowledged. HMNZS *Aotearoa* might have been built in Japan and fitted with American weapons, but her crew was pure Kiwi—professional, determined, and punching well above their weight class.

On the display, blue tracks raced out to meet red. Each SM-2 missile represented two million dollars and years of training, but in the simulation—and soon in reality—they were the only thing standing between the fleet and destruction.

""Splash one vampire,"" Kimura reported. ""Splash two. Three.""

The intercepts happened in rapid succession, red tracks winking out as they met blue. But not all of them. The math of modern naval warfare was brutally simple—launch enough missiles and some would always get through.

""Leaker!"" The warning came from *Te Kaha*'s air warfare coordinator. ""Vampire broke through, bearing one-seven-five! Engaging with Sea Ceptor!” The frigate's point-defense missiles were the last line before the close-in weapons systems.

Reid found herself gripping the edge of the plotting table as the track closed on *Te Kaha*. In reality, this would be the moment when sailors lived or died based on decisions made in microseconds.

""Splash vampire,"" the report came with audible relief. ""Kill confirmed at eight thousand meters.""

""Well done, *Te Kaha*,"" Reid murmured, then louder: ""TAO, what's our missile expenditure?""

Kimura consulted his readouts. ""Thirty-two SM-2s expended for twenty-eight kills. Eight Sea Ceptor for six kills. Magazines at sixty percent.""",2,1758249270.0,The_NZDF,0,1.0,False

So back in 2018-2019, i met a girl named D. we were in a sorority together and we became really good friends and became pretty much inseparable. she was known as the “cool girl” that EVERYONE wanted to be friends with and at first i didn’t see any red flags bc i was straight out of high school, wanted to make friends, and i looked up to her bc she had this natural charisma.

Time passes and we end up creating our own little friend group w 4 other girls and we were known in our sorority as the friend group that other people wanted to one day have friends like. we were all super close, did everything together, always there for each other, etc. we were basically like those ideal friend groups from movies and tv shows. it was all super cool, chill and fun and not gonna lie i fell into the propaganda HARD. anytime she would talk shit about someone, i would also talk shit bc i believed it was her venting about someone who did her dirty and i wanted her to feel validated.

Well, time passed and we ended up transferring to a different university all at the same time (the same university) and we did so not just to stay together but bc the school overall was just better. D had moved in with another girl in our sorority and they were roommates for a while. but all of a sudden she made her roommate super uncomfortable and she ended up moving out which flew RIGHT over my head at the time but looking back, D was definitely the problem. anyway, this gave open space for me and our other friend N to move in together and it was all chill!

But THIS is when shit started to spiral.

first few months living together were perfect but then going into sept/oct of 2020 (i can’t remember the exact date) shit started going south. i would notice that both D and N would be acting weird, standoffish, and they did tell me they didn’t like that i didn’t clean immediately after myself or forget to take out the trash which totally fair and i took full accountability for it. i was working 2 jobs at the time and had very little time for resting and actually being able to do the chores but i fixed it as soon as they called it out and apologized.

There was one day they both were making plans in front of me and it made me feel some type of way bc they planned to go out for ice cream in front of me and didn’t invite me. i brought this up to them and their excuse was “oh we just needed space away from you” and when i asked them why and what i could do to fix it to not make them uncomfortable they couldn’t give me a straight answer.

when it came to anything about my past relationships D would tell me to get over it and it’s in the past and she was tired of hearing about it but when D or N talked about their past relationship they would console each other and support one another and that made me feel really upset. Not to mention if D or N talked bad about someone to something they called it venting but when i did it i was being a crybaby and talking shit. the double standard was insane honestly.

then comes when D did my best friends hair (she was a stylist) and i helped my best friend schedule her appointment and it was set at 9am at our apartment. I did my part of waking up at 6am driving an hour to pick up my BF then driving another hour back to my apartment, giving me and my bestie an hour to get coffee / breakfast. when we arrive at the apartment D is still asleep. i told my friend it was bc she had gone to a party the night before so maybe she’s tired and my friend said she was cool with it because we could just chill. Eventually FOUR HOURS pass… and D is finally ready to start my friends hair. throughout the entire appointment D was just rude, silent, not talking, etc. despite being open and talkative with all her other clients. during the appointment i had invited my other friend over and D said she was fine with it bc she also always has friends over and it’s both our apartment so I ran it by her and she agreed. my other friend gets there and we start chatting it up. me, my best friend, and my other friend have all known each other since high school so we were talking about HS and just people we knew and D was acting standoffish and weird and i didn’t think anything of it. a few hours pass and it’s like 12am-1am and my best friend is like falling asleep in the chair because D has just taken forever to do her hair. she was taking breaks non stop, went to the gas station to get a lighter, not to mention showed up FOUR HOURS late to the appointment and my BF had been awake since 6am so she was exhausted. she finally told D “look you’re fine with 90% of my hair, i’ll pay you the full amount but i’m just so exhausted” and D got irritated by that and told her that she would only make her pay half the total cost and that it was fine. and i could tell she was irritated bc of the look on her face.

I found out the truth of how D felt about me when I was looking for my phone in the apartment and I grabbed our other roommates phone on accident bc we had the exact same phone and clear case. I saw ALLLL the text messages of them talking shit about me. D texting N calling me and my friends losers and trolls for talking about high school, D telling N i was annoying bc i didn’t give her a ride to work (she asked me to take her 10 minutes before the shift started and i was dead asleep), purposely making trips and conducting ways to do it in front of me, etc etc. I was baffled but I didn’t get to see the full extent of everything.

It wasn’t until me and D went on a trip together and I knew i needed to get closure. so i looked through D’s phone. i know that was probably the most toxic thing i’ve done but i needed proof that they were actually talking shit about me and when i read the messages in totality i knew they were not my friends. esp seeing texts of them talking bad about my best friends when they were the one being rude to her.

Then i had my bday party. long story short they got me plastered because they hyped me up to taking shots for my bday and smoking weed. i was literally wasted and i couldn’t stand up and instead of helping me, D just said “you need to get up bc im not gonna sit here and baby you while you’re drunk” and j literally couldn’t move so she left me there on the floor passed out and left. it hurt really bad especially bc for our other friends bday when she got drunk D was there consoling her, sitting with her, helped her change into comfy clothes, etc. but didn’t do anything like that with me. Found out later on that they only wanted to come to my bday party bc i bought all the alcohol but said they wish they would’ve gone to a frat party instead. not to mention they tried to get strangers to take me to bars so that they wouldn’t have to take care of me.

I started to notice all the ways that D would give me silent treatment if i disagreed with her or didn’t give her rides places, she would ignore me when i asked her questions, expect me to apologize for HER wrongs, and eventually she started getting the whole friend group against me.

After that trip I realized they were not real friends and i started to treat them the same way they treated me. if they did something wrong and expected me to apologize, i refused. if they got mad at me for not giving them rides i ignored them, i gave the same energy back and D acted like I just said the most offensive thing ever. She did NOT like that whatsoever and started getting the whole friend group against me even more.

One of our friends planned an ice skating thing for her bday and she said all the group could go and D quickly said “Actually it’s only going to be 4 instead of 5” and uninvited me from someone else’s bday event. later on, they ended up going and that friend just agreed with D. that same day D texted me and told me that if “i wasn’t being so weird maybe i wouldn’t have gotten uninvited” which is funny bc I was invited until she took the liberty to uninvite me from someone else’s event. I called her out and told her she was manipulative and toxic and that no wonder her old roommate moved out and that all her friends end up dropping her bc of the way she treats them. she did NOT like that and started trying to flip the script and act like i was the problem and said “you’re playing victim and it’s not cute. it’s manipulative” and in my head i’m like “how can i play victim and be manipulative when i am the victim of your terrible behavior?”

it spiraled and snowballed into something worse. I ended up isolating myself in my bedroom when she was home, didn’t talk to her if she was in the same room, would check her location to make sure i could be home freely without her being rude to me. it was a mental torture game and she did everything in her power to make sure the entire friend group stopped talking to me. she 1000% had the mind set of “if i don’t like someone then my friends can’t like them” and since the rest of the group was under her spell and her little puppets they all obeyed like little puppies. not a single ounce of individuality in that friend group.

come christmas time, i found out my family (who are autoimmune compromised) got covid. i was scared and had made a post in instagram asking to keep them in peoples thoughts for safety. not even 20 minutes later D texts me telling me she’s sorry about my family but I had 5 days to move out and find somewhere else to live or they would call the cops. i told her it was christmas and there was literally no where for me to go because landlords probably aren’t paying attention to people looking for homes and dorms are closed and she told me it wasn’t her issue and to figure it out.

i was stressed to say the least but i managed to find a room in a house pretty quickly since i spent every hour of everyday scouring facebook market. as i was moving out i went to take my things with me and me and N shared a room and had bunk beds. i took them apart because one of the beds was rightfully mine since we paid half and half. D like the little vindictive snake she is, called N’s MOM and told her i was stealing the bed and that the cops would be called. i told D i would talk to N when she got to the apartment from work and D gave my number to N’s mom who later texted me saying she would sue me if i took anything from the apartment i didn’t pay for but i literally paid for the bed.

N arrived later and we talked and suddenly she wanted to play this “i didn’t know” victim role when i called her out for talking shit about me and my friends. i told her how would she feel if someone talked shit about her best friend and she agreed she wouldn’t like it and i basically made her feel stupid for just following along everything D said and not having any sort of thinking for herself.

I eventually ended up moving out and disconnect from everyone and everything having to do with them. I found out that D went around and told the whole world a whole fabricated story about how i was the problem and i was the bad guy, and i lost all my friends and everyone believed her bc she was more “likeable”.

i ended up living in my car for a few days bc i had no where to go and lost all my friends, couldn’t go home bc my entire family had COVID and i was living off my last paycheck to make ends meet. i struggled a lot and this isn’t even the full extent of what D and that friend group did to me that was so vile and manipulative and abusive.

D truly was nothing but an abusive, manipulative, toxic, peaked in high school bully and mean girl. she needed to be the center of attention always and be the “leader” of every group she was apart of. if i found other friends she got mad at me and jealous for not being with her. she talked shit ahí it people she didn’t know and was NEVER happy about any of the success i had in life.

now it’s been 5 years and D has texted countless times asking to be my friend again, not taking any accountability when bringing up what happened between us, giving half ass apologies, saying she loves and misses me and constantly stalks my instagram and tiktok accounts. N stalks my accounts too and she’s gone so downhill, started dating a cheater and dropped out of school… not good.

i think it’s funny seeing how the girl everyone thought was this cool, popular, everyone likes her type of deal is begging for my friendship when she swore she didn’t need me in her life. but im glad i blocked her and don’t pay her mind.

i’ve graduated with my masters, lived in my dream city for three years, am engaged, well traveled, and have the life i have always wanted meanwhile she is still the same mean girl as ever. maybe she’s changed but she will never be a good person to me. it surprises me how she has so many people fooled that she’s a good person when she’s not.

I work hard, but I also make sure to enjoy the little things. I’m laid-back, approachable, and I’ve been told I’ve got a good mix of being thoughtful and goofy. One minute I can dive into a deep conversation, and the next I’ll crack a dumb joke or throw in a corny movie quote just to get a laugh. I’m really into books, everything from thought-provoking non-fiction to a gripping novel that keeps me up way too late. I also enjoy cooking when I get the chance, usually experimenting with simple dishes or trying out something new just for fun. And when I want to clear my head, there’s nothing better than a long drive with a good playlist or podcast, windows down, just letting the road do its thing. What I’m looking for is pretty clear: I’m drawn to older women. There’s just something magnetic about the confidence, maturity, and energy that comes with knowing what you want. I admire honesty, consistency, and people who don’t play games, because I don’t either. If you’re looking for someone genuine who can match your energy and is up for shared adventures, we’ll get along. Even though I’m based around NYC/NJ, I’m not tied down. I’m willing to travel for the right connection. Life’s too short to stay in one lane, and I think the best connections are worth the effort. Whether it’s swapping book recommendations over coffee, exploring a new neighborhood, or planning a getaway just for fun, I’m all about creating memories and keeping things real.

1nkrdxk,https://i.redd.it/nb2bwj6d61qf1.jpeg,Some tricks I use to stay locked in for 4 hours,"I know a lot of us struggle with staying locked in for long study sessions (3–4 hours). Here are a few tips that help me hit that focus zone without burning out:

* **Make a task list before you start** Don’t just “study.” Break it down into specific tasks (ex: review Ch. 5 notes, do 15 practice questions, summarize key concepts). This gives you direction and a sense of completion when you tick them off.
* **Turn off your phone** 99% of the time, nothing important is happening in those 4 hours. Airplane mode or “Do Not Disturb” saves you from endless notifications.
* **Block distracting websites** If you know you’ll end up on YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, etc., set up a site blocker. Out of sight, out of mind.
* **Use the 50/10 system (or similar)** Study for 50 minutes, then take a 10-minute break. Get up, stretch, drink water. This keeps your brain refreshed and prevents burnout.
* **Set the environment right** Clear your desk, get your water/coffee ready, put on noise-canceling headphones or instrumental audio. Your brain will associate the setup with focus.

When you put these together, 4 hours doesn’t feel like a huge mountain, it feels like 4 blocks of manageable focus time.

I’m an anachronism, an old soul, a paradox of someone who has simultaneously been through too much and too little. My heart yearns to find that one perfect partner, someone whom I can put my faith and my trust in, to be with me through thick and thin. But, navigating this modern climate of digital communication, ghosting, and situationships is proving to be a challenge. 

Hence, this is my call for a simpler, older method of love. One where we get to know each other through long, descriptive texts like letters, where we carefully select one individual with whom to invest our time in. 

Here’s the facts about me. I’m an introvert (INFP), 6’, East Asian, slightly overweight (but attempting to lose it), with a full-time job and a graduate degree. I am not interested in politics, religion, or games (of the digital or mental kind). I enjoy reading, going on nature, and relaxing with a nice cup of coffee/tea at a cafe/bookstore. I believe relationships require mutual effort, honesty, and commitment. I would like to have children someday, ideally two. 

Here’s the facts about you: You are between the ages of 23-33, of reasonable health and attractiveness. You live close enough where we can drive no more than an hour to meet and start going on dates shortly after we connect. You do not use drugs/alcohol, and have minimal body modifications. Your family/financial situation are relatively normal. You are capable of maintaining a conversation that is engaging, philosophical, and playful. You are kind, intelligent, emotionally mature, affectionate, and loyal. Despite being the “good girl” all your life, you’ve never really felt like you fit in, and you wonder why you’re still alone when everyone around you seems to fall into relationships so easily. Perhaps it’s because we are both introverts, too shy to make the first move. 

Perhaps it’s because we were waiting for someone special.

The ""FREE"" button under the box would get replaced with the button for 10 gems and even though I'd watched the whole ad, I wouldn't get the box. I was told to clear the game's cache if that happened again. I did but the problem kept returning.

Today almost none of the free items with an ad watch worked anymore. One ad worked normally, but I got the ""Please Wait..."" error for one 15 free energy, two bubbles and also with the blue energy box. The ads played just fine and I watched the full ad, so I don't think I'm doing anything to cause this problem.

Decided to clear the game's cache yet again, but I think it made things worse this time. After clearing the cache, the download took three attempts before it finished, and once it did, the game gave me the ""oops here's 10 energy because your ad didn't play"" message but I didn't get that 10 energy. I was at 61 energy and after the 10 energy ""oops"" message, was still at 61. Then I was merging some coffees and the ice cube showed up unexpectedly when I still had 53 energy. At that point I just gave up.

Is anyone else getting anything at all like this happening to them?

I’ve got a coffee date coming up with a close friend — she’s very conservative, and I know Trump and Charlie Kirk will probably come up.

I don’t know exactly where she stands, but I’d genuinely like to hear her take, especially on Charlie’s comments about MLK and minority groups. Any practical tips for navigating these convos?

I’ll pray beforehand and do my best to be quick to listen, slow to anger, and gentle. But I’m also human and I know emotional regulation only goes so far.

I respect leaders like McCain and Romney for calling out Trump’s lack of character as a leader and as a Christian. For me, this isn’t about party lines. I’d vote Republican in a heartbeat if I thought the Democratic candidate lacked a moral compass.

So how do we talk about these topics openly in the church without offending people? Because they are real issues. I see more and more personal agendas being twisted into faith, and then people comparing influencers like Charlie to Paul or Stephen.

Am I missing something here? Please educate me.

*loud and continuous knocking at the door, followed by a deep and gentle* ""Hello?.""

(What the fuck.) I thought to myself. 
.
No one should be out here. Rich told me during our conversation at the station, that nobody is allowed in the area besides staff because of the fire near by. But maybe it is just a lost hiker or something? I don't know. 

*the knocking continues. Getting louder and harder than before*

But I should check, the machete Rich told me about is right by the desk, I want it just in case this isn't a lost hiker. I get out of my seat slowly and I pick up the machete and put it behind me so I don't scare whoever might be behind the door, if this is just a lost hiker. And than I slowly walk to the door. And before I get to the door, just to be safe. 

""Hel...Hello?..."" 

And just like that. No more knocking. Nothing at all now. 

I approached the door and put my hand on the knob. I slowly turn it and pull the door open gently. 

Nothing standing there. Nothing at all. 

I quickly turn around and go to grab the flashlight on the desk and take a walk around the cabin while basically touching it by staying so close.

Not a sign of anyone being here besides me. Absolutely nothing at all. 
Crickets chirp around me, owls who-ing in the distance. As peaceful as a night should and can be.

(What the actual hell was that?) I thought to myself. 

I make my way back inside and shut and lock the door. I make sure all windows are shut and locked. And turn everything off in the cabin. 

It was close to 1:30 by this point. and since I had done the check in on the outside and everything was normal. Besides what happened. 

I decided that I should get in bed and hopefully go to sleep. 

I brushed my teeth and cleaned my face, just trying to ignore what just happened. thankfully the water does work well and is even heated. So that's a plus right now. I Got my clothes changed and started into bed. 

I made sure I brought my own sleeping bag and pillows, didn't wanna use old and God knows how many people's heads have used ones here. 

The bed is nothing amazing. It's a twin size bed that looks like it has been clearly well used. But thankfully has visibly clean sheets and a comforter. But I still put my sleeping on top of the cover. Tucked my inside and got all good and comfortable. Pretty cool in the cabin this time of the year so the sleeping bag was a good choice. 

After a little bit I ended up passing out and apparently sleeping through the whole night. Without a peep from me. but with plenty of sounds all around me. Peaceful.
A Goodnight to me.

I woke up the next morning around 8:30, it was cold that morning so it took a lot of energy and motivation to get out of my sleeping bag. Cause who like's waking up freezing. 

But once I did get out, I started on my normal morning routine. Got coffee, brushed my teeth. Clean clothes on and prepared myself for the start of a new day and my new life for awhile. 


.""Several weeks later"".


Time went by rather quickly being out here. When I first came out here it was chilly and leafs just started falling off of the trees and bushes. But still nice. 

Now a small and thin blanket of snow covering everything all around me. Giving my zone an air of beauty I didn't know was possible. 

Been obviously spending most of time walking my zone during the day. So far I'm getting use to my zone, walking around and marking everything I can in my map and notes for reference points and land marks. 
I made sure to take plenty notes of all animals activities. 

The patterns of the herds of Deer I see around take and do. How often I see a squirrel take a dump, and that a duck I saw flying over head the other day, I couldn't recognize it but it was pretty interesting and cool. 
I even got a beautiful picture of Two chipmunks sitting on a snow covered log while it lightly sprinkled over top of them.

Also been getting my daily routine down pat at the cabin of radioing into the Ranger station of my accounts throughout the day and filing my reports on the computer to send to headquarters and Rich. And also getting pretty good at Texas Hold 'Em in my down time. And still can't make out the temp on the oven. So I just set it to something and wait til it gets warm and throw my food in and just watch it. What a life.

Haven't had any more moments of silence or guest showing up to the cabin randomly. 
I say hello everytime I step outside, walk to a new spot I haven't been. And everytime I walk back inside the cabin. It's becoming a second nature thing for me to do by this point. Things were normal. 

Then there was one morning after waking up. Something wasn't normal. It was quiet.
I woke up and couldn't hear. It hasn't happened before like this.

I thought to myself (ehh you just woke up, maybe just still asleep some and not hearing everything right away.)

So I get up and walk to the bathroom which isn't far from my bed. I pee and start my morning bathroom routine. 
I still couldn't hear anything. Not evening me peeing. 

Still just thinking I'm half asleep. I went to go start washing my face and hands, and also brush my teeth. I turn the water on and couldn't hear the faucet running, nor anything on the sink making noise when I moved them. Absolute silence. 

I thought that maybe I haven't said enough hellos or missed saying it at some point yesterday. Wasn't sure but again, better safe than sorry. I said ""Hello"" and waited for the sweet sounds of the woods to creep back in like they have before. Except Nothing happened. Not even my own voice made a sound when I spoke. 
I haven't even heard the gentle ""Hello"" I have everytime before. Just absolute and utter silence. 

I start to panic a little and get my clothes on fast as I can and walk outside to start saying ""Hello"" and hope everything goes back to normal. 
Get my pants on, a shirt and some slippers I brought.
I open the front door. Walk to the bottom of the last step going outside. Take a deep breath and yell ""Hello!"". 
Still nothing. Not even another ""Hello"" or anything making the slightest noise.

(Oh shit. this can't be good.)I thought. (I can send an email to the Station and let them know what's happening.) after that I headed back inside, got on the computer and wrote to the station a message. 

""Rich or Josh are you guy's there? I just woke up and I can't hear anything. What's going on?"" 

I Sent it and waited by the computer for a response. 

It took a few minutes to get a response but when I did, it was Jonah. 

He said. 
""Alex it's Jonah. Rich and Josh left out earlier this morning to go meet with the neighboring County Ranger teams to discuss some roads being blocked by some downed trees cause by the snow by the county line and to see what needs to be done. They told me to wait inside for messages or calls on the radio.""

I wasn't expecting him to then say this. 

""But I can't hear anything either, have you been making sure to say Hello?"" 

More fear creeping in now. I responded. 

Me.
""Yes I have, literally every time I make a step or breath I take I say it so the silence stays away. 
Have you been making sure to say it?"" 

Jonah.
""Of course I have, I've been working here for 4 years now and have never slipped up once. Are you sure you've been saying it?""

Me.
""YES IVE BEEN SAYING IT I SWEAR!. Is there any reason you know why it's happening if everyone here makes sure to says it? Obviously we have been doing it or it would have happened sooner right?"" 

It took Jonah a good five or more minutes to respond to me. When he did he said. 

Jonah.
""Right, but this has happened like this before. We got it quick but......about a year ago or more. During the off season, a homeless person wondered into the park and got lost. it happened then, stayed quiet while we looked for them. Rich had me stay at the station while him and Josh went looking. After probably two hours of searching they found him and brought him back to the station. He couldn't speak and we don't know why. But once they got him inside. All noise came back.""

Me.
""So does that mean there's possibly someone lost out here and they're causing this to happen? And why couldn't he speak?

Jonah.
""it's a high probability, even though the parks closed for the season. But we don't know and couldn't find out. He couldn't write or sign anything, he didn't even acknowledge we were there. Just a dead stare on his face the whole time he was here. We called the police and they came and took him.""

I had to ask. 

Me.
""What happened to him?"" 

Jonah.
""I don't know, never heard anything after they left with him. But like then.  I'm guessing if we can't hear anything. Someone's gotta be out there."" 

Me.
""Okay, should I start making my way to the station and we set out and both start looking together?""

Jonah.
""No I can't leave. Rich said no matter what, don't leave the station. someone's gotta be here to radio into and take calls from headquarters. Except now it's a message headquarters thing. You should head out and start by your cabin and work your way around til you get to the station, check in with me before heading back around."" 

Great, now I have to go look for someone who's not supposed to be out here and bring them back to safety, while not being able to hear a dang thing. Obviously a lost person isn't good and I'm not upset at them for being lost. Just not sure how easy it'll be since we can't hear anything. And not knowing what happens with it quite like this for a long time. But i gotta look for them. No just for their safety. But possibly for all of us out here.

Me.
""Okay, I'll get a bag packed with some supplies and start from the east side of the cabin and work my way to you. And what's the code to the safe in my cabin with the gun?""

Jonah.
""It's 2709. All the shells for it should be in there and have a bag to carry them in.""

Me.
""Great. Hopefully I won't have to use it for anything. But better safe than sorry.
If I don't make it by night fall to the Station. Come looking."" 

Jonah.
""Understood. Bring your radio with you too just in case you find them and can call it in. Good luck, and Be safe.""

Me. 
""I'll do my best. Thank you.""

I get out of my seat and start throwing on my cold weather clothes and boots and Pack a bag with some food and water and an extra jacket. Flashlight and batteries, the radio. And get the gun from the safe and load it full and throw the ammo bag over my shoulder as fast I could move. 
I grab my map and head out looking for someone out here, hoping to stop this soon.

I started going east and making my loop toward the station, I'm looking at probably a probably a good Ten plus miles I have to put in until I get to the station, I had to try and make it there before night and hopefully have found someone on the way and make the silence go away. 

Time passes and I've made it probably close to five miles by now. Still haven't found anyone and the silence hasn't gone away yet. I started walking at 9 and it's 11:30 now. At least I'm making good time.

I start to get close to a spot I marked on my map that has a small pond that usually the animals around here drink out of. I was expecting it to be frozen over from the cold and no animals around.

I was wrong.

I see a Buck is thrashing all around in the pond breaking up the ice. The buck is mangled and covered in blood, and laying all around the pond are the bodies of other deer, looks like five to six of them. 

(Wh...what the hell?)I think to myself. 

And after a few seconds of watching it. It sees me. And it starts coming towards me.

I met Kyle recently in classes at my new school for university, we hit it off as friend right away, similar interests and stuff, and we talk all the time. Even introduced him to my partner (also 19M) and we've all hung out.

Yesterday, during class he invited me to his place (lives with roommates, who were home) to drink and play some games. I thought itd be fun and agreed to go. My partner was working, so it was just us. Everything was normal for a while, and then he went to get the drinks while I loaded the game up. 

He took the bottles which were already on the coffee table, into the kitchen to pour them. I thought that was kinda weird but I brushed it off. A noticeable amount of time later he came back with a couple drinks poured. When I picked mine up and took a sip, it tasted off in a way I can't describe. I thought it was just a drink ive never had or something, but when I asked him it was all things that I know what they taste like.

 The more questions I asked the more irritated he started to get and the more pushy he was for me to start drinking more. Things like ""oh come on we're not gonna get drunk at that rate"" or ""lets chug them at the same time"" or similar things. I was getting really uncomfortable and said I was going to the bathroom. While he was focused on the game I took my drink with me. When I looked at the bottom of the glass closer, the drink wasn't nearly as clear as it should have been (gin and tonic) and looked cloudy, almost white and I got really scared since I had drank over half of it. I texted my partner to call me with an ""emergency"", apologized to him and went to leave. He tried to stop me, saying that I'd be in ""no state to drive"" even though I had only had half a drink. I quickly said I'd be fine and drove to my partners place. Irresponsible I know, but he lived 7 mins away so it was okay.

Its morning now, and other than panic and fear I didnt feel much else last night after I got to my partners place. I felt dizzy for a while, nauseous, and paranoid but those also happen when I get really anxious so idk. Not quite sure what to do here, but I needed to let it out somewhere.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL. Not opposed to finding friends from around the world though!

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

>As far as the Anuad:
>
>Nirn (Female/Land/Freedom catalyst for birth-death of enantiomorph)/ Anu-Padomay (enantiomorph with requisite betrayal)/ ?* (Witnessing Shield-thane who goes blind or is maimed and thus solidifies the wave-form; blind/maimed = = final decision)
>
>*Seek and you shall find. I hid it.

When I went looking through this subreddit for theories about who the hidden Shield-thane is, I was surprised to find very little on the subject. A few people hypothesized ""SITHISIT"" (something that both is and is-not Sithis). I think the answer is much simpler. Note the phrasing: ""I hid it."" In [the IRC reveal of the Amaranth](https://gist.github.com/numinit/34ba3bacc21e19e21c46), MK says this:

>We are talking about the Amaranth. You wanted to know who it was. **I hid it** a long time ago when I hid the Anew in **the sun**.

Then later he says this, paraphrasing [a Babylonian tablet about Nibiru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibiru_(Babylonian_astronomy)):

>Amaranth anon Anew AE I, which is said to have occupied the passageways of heaven and earth, because everyone above and below asks Amaranth anon Anew AE I if they cannot find the passage. […] may his name be I and no other, for **he takes up the center of it** in sleep. The path of the stars of the sky should be kept unchanged but will not, for he dreams in the sun and now has dreamed of **orphans, anon Magne-Ge, the colors he still wishes to dream**.

Anu sleeps in the I/AE, which is pronounced ""eye"". He occupies the passageways of heaven and earth, which is what the sun is. He dreams of Magne-Ge, which are Magnus's children. According to MK's recipe, the witness ""goes blind or is maimed and thus solidifies the wave-form; blind/maimed = = final decision"".

>Magrus left to the heavens blinded, but Azurah made of his eye a stone to reflect the Varliance Gate. This is the Aether Prism, which opens at Dawn and closes at Dusk.

–[*Spirits of Amun-dro: The Sky Spirits*](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Sky_Spirits)

Magnus is blinded, and the sun is his blinding. Anu ""hid himself in the sun and slept"". In other words, Anu the Amaranth resides in Magnus's blindness, which is his ""final decision"". Anu won the Enantiomorph.

So what does it actually *mean* that Magnus is the Witness? Well, he ""solidifies the wave-form"", which is a reference to the quantum [observer effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)). Without a Witness, everything is MAYBE. The Witness decides IS or IS NOT. They impose definition upon the chaos of the Dream… by looking at it.

>The New Man becomes God becomes Amaranth, everlasting hypnogogic [sic]. Hallucinations become lucid under His eye

–[*Loveletter from the Fifth Era*](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/General:Loveletter_From_the_Fifth_Era)

>Just wanna say because I never think I did, the whole ""it was all just a dream"" avenue is completely missing the point. Consider your lucid dreams, if you've been lucky enough to have ever had one.

–[MK](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/General:Michael_Kirkbride's_Posts#On_CHIM_making_Tamriel_boring_because_it_makes_it_.22all_a_dream.22_.282011-01-18.29)

A lucid dream is when the dreamer's avatar (their self-insert) is conscious and can manipulate the dream. The dreamer's unconscious mind constructs and runs the dream as a whole, while their conscious mind manifests inside it as their avatar and can control the dream. By this analogy, the Anu and Padomay inside the Dream are the Dreamer's unconscious mind, forever dreaming the world into existence. Magnus is the avatar of the Dreamer's conscious mind, the part capable of volition and intention (""wishes to dream""), gazing upon creation through the eye of the sun.

Generally speaking, Anu (inside the Dream) isn't really depicted as a character who does stuff. He's a primordial cosmic force. In [*The Annotated Anuad*](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Annotated_Anuad), that's because he's asleep… except for the time he wasn't.

>Anu awoke, and fought Padomay again. The long and furious battle ended with Anu the victor. He cast aside the body of his brother, who he believed was dead, and attempted to save Creation by forming the remnants of the 12 worlds into one -- Nirn, the world of Tamriel. As he was doing so, Padomay struck him through the chest with one last blow. Anu grappled with his brother and pulled them both outside of Time forever.

If Magnus represents the conscious/lucid/""awake"" state of the Godhead, then this lines up with the other creation myths. Magnus manifests in the Aurbis (""Anu awoke""), creates Nirn, is mortally wounded by the force of Limitation, and flees to Aetherius (""outside of Time""). Nearly all sources agree that Magnus fled out of self-preservation, and most call it cowardice. But not all:

>When Magic (Magnus), architect of the plans for the mortal world, decided to terminate the project, the Gods convened at the Adamantine Tower [Direnni Tower, the oldest known structure in Tamriel] and decided what to do. Most left when Magic did. […] With Magic (in the Mythic Sense) gone, the Cosmos stabilized.

–[*Before the Ages of Man*](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Before_the_Ages_of_Man)

Douglas Goodall suggests both are true:

>Magnus is Aedra Star and Magic Man. Magnus Invisible is more. Only a coward flees his creation. Only a hero dies holding the door. […] Magnus Visible is blind magic. Magnus Invisible magnifies. 

–[*The Soft Doctrines of Magnus Invisible*](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/General:The_Soft_Doctrines_of_Magnus_Invisible,_revised)

In the upper subgradient from which the Amaranth originates (the one where Nir died), Magnus the Witness stabilized the waveform. But in the Aurbic subgradient, which is a holograph of the above, Magnus the God destabilizes the Cosmos by his presence. In the Kalpic Enantiomorph, the Witness is a destructive force:

>To me, Tamrielic kalpas are Extinction Events caused by three people trying to catch one another (King/Rebel/Lover) and a witness that sees the resulting eschaton. These roles are always somehow re-enacted in a holographic fractal until SNAP the three do catch one another and things splode and another kalpa begins. […] The current kalpa is the King or Rebel (Which is which?) trying to break the rules of the game, freezing time and space so that he can have the Lover (Who?) without the explodo. He is trying not to be seen with the Lover, trying to consummate it (Which will do what?). He has made several attempts at killing or erasing potential Witnesses so that he can get that freak on.

–[PGE2 Conceptualization](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/General:Pocket_Guide_to_the_Empire,_Second_Edition/Conceptualization#Kalpa_Akaishicorprus)

Obviously, that's a different Enantiomorph dynamic than the Amaranth one, but it is an echo of it, so I think it's valid to hypothesize that the Amaranth Witness is destructive as well. Here's the thing: once you become lucid, it's not easy to sustain both lucidity and the dream. Lucid dreaming is a delicate balance between awake and asleep, and it's difficult to maintain that balance.

Magnus's presence in the Cosmos destabilizes it. In the Kalpa Enantiomorph, the Witness's observation causes an ""explosion"" that ends the Kalpa. I think that in the Amaranth Enantiomorph, Magnus's observation could cause an ""explosion"" that ends the Dream. That might be what the Nibiru invocation above means by ""may his name be I and no other, for he takes up the center of it in sleep"". Too much lucidity means too much awake means the dream ends.

Am I sure about any of this? No, absolutely not. Nearly all of this is from IRC logs, unfinished rough drafts, off-the-cuff comments, and brainstorming sessions. I love [*The Soft Doctrines of Magnus Invisible*](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/General:The_Soft_Doctrines_of_Magnus_Invisible,_revised), but those are by a different author. (And Magnus is allegedly [a jarl and/or scout, not a shield-thane](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/General:Shor_Son_of_Shor).)

Greetings, travelers, faeries, and wandering souls of Reddit! ✨🌙

I am in search of penpals who would like to exchange letters via snail mail (or other preferred magical courier) with a touch of whimsy. As I dive deeper into fantasy escapism and seeking a more slow mindful life, I would love to share it with new friends and sharpen my writing skills! I’d love to find a creative penpal to share stories, drawings, other artsy bits and pieces of life, motivational side quests, thoughts, opinions, poems, and maybe even bizarre questions (like what loot you would drop in a video game). Heartfelt writing exchanged between two travelers experiencing the journey that life has to offer. Expect wax seals, stickers, doodles, snippets of lore, music recommendations, and 2am brain dumps with a touch of magic!

A tad more about this adventurer:

🍄 21/F from the USA

🍄 I have an endless list of hobbies including crafting of all sorts (crocheting, sewing, knitting), playing instruments (bass guitar, acoustic and electric guitar), playlist curation, hiking, fashion, roller skating, thrifting, & daydreaming to name a few

🍄 Currently a college student hoping to study biomedical/chemical engineering

🍄 I would love to start reading more (would love book recs), have always had the urge to become a runner (I am slowly working on it!), want to learn another language, and to start jewelry making

🍄 I enjoy a good coffee shop or wasting away on little picnics in the park

🍄 I am very much an optimist, maybe overly ambitious, and a huge dreamer!

I admire positivity, kindness, and a warm heart. I believe in independence, but also in supporting each other and growing together through life’s ups and downs.

Been angry at myself because of the past mistakes I did. Anyways here's what actually stuck with me:

1. Make it obvious, not hidden. Stop relying on willpower and start designing your environment. I put my gym clothes next to my bed and my phone charger in the kitchen. Small changes, massive results.
2. Stack habits, don't isolate them. Instead of ""I'll meditate sometime today,"" I do ""After I pour my morning coffee, I meditate for 5 minutes."" Linking new habits to existing ones is like giving them a GPS.
3. Start stupidly small. I wanted to read more, so I committed to reading ONE PAGE per day. Sounds ridiculous, but I haven't missed a day in 8 months. Now I read 20-30 pages without even thinking about it.
4. Focus on identity, not outcomes. Instead of ""I want to lose 20 pounds,"" I started saying ""I'm the type of person who works out."" Every small action became evidence of who I was becoming, not just what I was trying to achieve.
5. Never miss twice. Life happens. You'll skip a workout or eat junk food. The key is getting back on track immediately. Missing once is an accident, missing twice is the beginning of a new habit.
6. Make it satisfying immediately. I created a simple habit tracker and checked off each completed habit. That little dopamine hit from marking an X kept me going when motivation died.
7. Environment beats willpower every time. I removed Instagram from my phone's home screen and put Kindle there instead. Guess what? I started reading more and scrolling less. Your environment is constantly voting for your habits.

What's one tiny habit you could start today that would compound into something amazing over time? And what's the smallest version of that habit you could commit to? I realized for me it was working out. I stacked my other habits from working out early in the morning thanks to this book.

By my wake time, it’s usually too hot this time of year to take a walk or simply tend to the garden.  How did others that are home for hours after waking cope with no ciggs with coffee?  Sorry no coffee isn’t an option. 1 drug at a time. LOL I’ve cut back and will only have 1 cup maybe. After eating, I know. Move. I can’t after supper!  I’m in a food coma. The late nights as I’m starting to fade are big smoke times for me as well. 

I feel God has sent me my last warning shot. I have COPD. My doctor has said anyone that smoked more than 10 years has some form of COPD.  Lung xray before last showed lungs of long time smoker. Last xray showed small changes. I forget the words. My throat bothers me. The tickle spot on days following a heavy smoke night is more intense. I hold that spot rubbing it. I cough during the nights for the past 3 weeks on & off. I had a cold for a bit of that time.  It feels like that stronger tickle in throat causes some sleepless hours from that annoying, intense, tickle, cough 

Driving factors Health fears. The embarrassment, the smell. The money 

Coping mechanism. Move a muscle change of thought. Wait five more minutes. Hold something in my hand. Over brush my teeth. NRT patches and gum. Popsicles.

1nkqg2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesirenstories/comments/1nkqg2g/welcome_to_the_siren_stories/,Welcome to The Siren Stories!,"Hey everyone!

I am launching a new podcast soon The Siren Stories where we share real stories from current and former pardners (and customers) of a certain big coffee chain. Whether you’ve been behind the bar, at a certain support center, or just on the other side of the counter, you know there are endless stories that deserve to be told. I’m surprised there’s not a sitcom about it tbh. 

I’d love for this podcast to be shaped by the community, not just me. I’m not looking to just bag on the ‘ol bux. I met my spouse, close friends and owe my career to the place. I think we can all agree, we’ve seen some shit and the company is headed in an interesting direction. Things seem to be escalating week by week. If you have a story you’d like to share or even just feedback on what you’d want to hear, please leave a comment. 

Episodes will feature a mix of personal stories, current and expardner conversations, and listener submissions. 

If you’ve ever worked at the third place or have interesting thoughts to share, I’d love to hear from you!

A 156 ☕💚

I started to sit next to her during class and I struck up a conversation after class. We started talking after class and realized we have  we both recently moved to Florida from the same state and have a lot in common. Now I usually sit near her or near mutual friends, and we often walk together to the parking garage after class since we both commute. She’s very outgoing and bubbly with everyone, so it’s easy to have lighthearted conversations where we’re both laughing.

I got her number one day hoping we could grab coffee between our two classes, but she usually has other plans during that time. I texted her the next day to say it was me, and after a quick “hey,” I tried to keep the conversation going. She didn’t reply until the next morning with a “have a good weekend,” so I left it there.

It’s been a few weeks since then and our routine hasn’t changed. We still walk and talk after class, and often she’s the one who initiates. But because she’s bubbly with everyone and was kind of dismissive over text, I can feel this becoming just a class buddy situation. And being stuck in that kind of dynamic with someone I’m attracted to is annoying and frustrating. 

Curious what other people would do in this situation ",1,1758245556.0,AskMenAdvice,4,1.0,False

hi there! my name is Brian, i’m 26, newly graduated from my doctorate program in pharmacy. I’ve been noticing that i’ve been a bit more homebody and lonely these past couple of months, and id love to get to know some lovely people

There’s a bit about me in my profile, including photos and more about me!

I just finished up some time in michigan, and now i’m back on the west coast, looking to start up my career a bit! I’ve got a big heart and am happy to start taking things a bit slow to see how we start to mesh. I’m the kind of person that remembers how you like your coffee in the morning, likes to ask how you’re feeling during your day, and generally likes to listen and support you emotionally. 

Ideally you are: within 5 years of my age, also interested in physical fitness, like to read, play video games, and above all are kind :) 

Thanks for taking the time to read this!

1nkqe26,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1nkqe26/got_in_trouble_at_work_because_of_charlie_kirk/,Got in trouble at work because of Charlie Kirk?,"So, I had a meeting with my immediate supervisor today. He’s a good guy. I like him, and I really do think he does his best. We were talking about some of the issues we’ve both had with one of the company’s owners, who can be unpredictable and frustrating at times. I also mentioned the difficulties I’ve been having with my department team, especially one coworker who was cold toward me from the start and didn’t train me properly. More recently, it came out that she hadn’t been doing her job correctly for years, which only got discovered when I took over part of her caseload.

Anyway, during the meeting, my supervisor brought up a concern. Apparently, someone went to one of the owners and claimed that I laughed at Charlie Kirk’s assassination. For context, I was at work when it happened and a few coworkers asked me who he was. I tried to explain it neutrally, saying things like, “He’s the guy in reels with the coffee mug and the ‘prove me wrong’ sign,” and “He was a polarizing figure who went to college campuses to debate, and a lot of people didn’t like him.” I even showed a few coworkers the video after warning them it was graphic.

For the record: I didn’t laugh. I just explained who he was. I’m pretty liberal, and I know some of the owners and coworkers lean conservative, so I usually keep my political opinions to myself. I used to talk more openly with a like-minded coworker, but they don’t work here anymore.

So now it feels like someone is deliberately twisting things to make me look bad. It honestly blows my mind that a coworker would try to accuse me of something I didn't do. And that I actually have to be worried about this. 

I don't even know if it was the one coworker who I have really big problems with. She kinda has her little ""click"" that follow her around and it could have been one of them too 😔 I just need a new job. 

Also kinda nuts being targeting because I have different politics then they do. ",58,1758245408.0,GenZ,85,0.82,False

My multi-year plan,"I've been a very heavy coffee drinker in the past, 600-1000mg for 20 years or so, tried a few approaches to quit, but other than the withdrawls, I could never afford the time for low productivity both mentally and phisically.

My plan is to really take my time, use caffeine tablets that I can break down to 25m doses and use decaf coffee for the ""ritual"".

First step was to drop coffee and go to caffeine tablets, but maintain 600mg a day, that was a bit strange already and got me a bit tired.

Then another week or so to get used to 500m and another one to 400mg. I'm stuck here for about a month now, 200mg before morning workout, 100mg before lunch, 100mg after lunch.

Once I settle and see the opportunity on a lower life load period, I will drop another 50mg per day, settle there for another month or so, repeat the process. No rush.

What is another 1-2 years at a symbolic dose, if I spent 2 decades at 600mg+

This may also allow the brain to adapt and not bother as much with the ""when do i feel normal again"".

( Even if it’s not related to my theme)

My main question is, what can I use for a heatable insert?

Something that stays warm for a while. Or maybe something I can take out and charge when needed.  I am missing my cat and would like something to hold. 

Also what’s your favorite fidget inserts? 
Or do you have any fun ideas?

The plan so far is: 

Now that my big beargoyle is under surgery for poly pellet paws.  I thought that before we put them all back together I could add in some fun things.  

Like

- Embroidered moss and weathered details. Things like dew drop beads, and silver spider web accents hiding in ear!

Maybe a tiny dainty spider hanging out?
Almost like an earring.  This mod I think will happen over time as a calm craft. 

- Add magnet in accessory areas for invisible attachments. 

Like coffee cup/paw.  
Head/ horn or bows.  Maybe felt headphones!
Back/wings

Oh!

My thought for my minigoyle (names pebble) is that I could get an embroidered moth.  Add some secret magnets and then pebble has a friend too!

The fidget I have added is a marble maze hidden in the wing.  So far I have created a hole to look like weather damage and am sewing the path maze now.  I will use a glass bead. After it’s done I’ll add the weathered moss on top here and there. 

I only have this on one side so far. Please note 
I removed the stabilizer and realized after that it….. stabilized the wing 😂.  So it doesn’t hold shape but I don’t mind because it goes with my theme of old weathered gargoyle and new to this world pup. 

These are the only ideas I have now, I thought maybe a switch like fidget or button hidden in ear or paw?

I know crinkle is a popular add on but I will be using this to sleep and I’ll keep the world up if it makes noise. (Buuut I could always and that to another non sleep bab.)

Anywho thank you all for your time, I would love to hear your ideas or your favorite modifications on your friends.  ",4,1758244737.0,buildabear,5,1.0,False

But what if you could go one step further, connecting with people not just in your general area, but within a few blocks of your front door? That’s exactly what hyper-local advertising makes possible. At BusySeed, we help companies, from small local shops to national franchises, win in the digital space using hyper-local, geo-targeted ad strategies powered by our proprietary tool: SeedGeo.

As a trusted [Google Ads agency](https://www.busyseed.com/how-we-helped-one-contractor-get-a-6-12-cpl-with-google-ads), we combine hyper-local targeting with [paid search advertising](https://www.busyseed.com/paid-advertising), ensuring your business appears exactly when and where your ideal customer is searching. Unlike many [marketing companies NYC](https://www.busyseed.com/marketing-agencies-in-new-york-city-key-trends-to-shape-their-success-in-2025) businesses turn to, we’ve built our reputation on precision, not guesswork. With over a decade of experience and having helped more than 500 businesses, we know what works. So if you're looking for a tactical advantage, this is your beginner’s guide to hyper-local advertising with SeedGeo.



# What is Hyper-Local Advertising?

Hyper-local advertising is the practice of targeting customers in a tightly defined geographic area—think within one mile of your business or even a specific zip code. Instead of casting a wide net, you're serving ads to potential customers exactly where they are, exactly when they need you.

Unlike broader digital marketing campaigns, hyper-local advertising leverages tools like GPS, IP addresses, and mobile data points to deliver timely, highly relevant ads. When implemented well, it can lead to significantly higher engagement and conversion rates. And that’s where SeedGeo comes into play.



# Introducing SeedGeo: Your Hyper-Local Advantage

SeedGeo is BusySeed’s proprietary ad tech tool designed for precision targeting at a street-level scale. It helps small businesses and national brands serve location-specific content to users within geo-fenced zones.

Whether you’re promoting a community event, driving in-store foot traffic, or capturing customers from nearby competitors, SeedGeo allows for unprecedented ad precision. And when combined with our [PPC management services](https://www.busyseed.com/paid-advertising), your ROI is no longer a guessing game; it’s measurable, trackable, and scalable.

  
**Here’s how SeedGeo works:**

* Define a small geo-fenced area (even specific buildings or streets).
* Choose your audience based on behavior, interests, and geo-habits.
* Launch PPC or [paid search advertising](https://www.busyseed.com/paid-advertising) campaigns that appear for users specifically within that area.

SeedGeo is the secret weapon that sets BusySeed apart from other [marketing companies NYC](https://www.busyseed.com/marketing-agencies-in-new-york-city-key-trends-to-shape-their-success-in-2025). We're not just targeting by city, we're targeting by footsteps.



# Why Hyper-Local Advertising Works

Let’s look at some quick industry stats:

* 80% of local searches on mobile devices convert into purchases (source: Think with Google).
* Mobile-ad engagement increases by 55% when personalized messaging is added.
* Businesses using geo-targeting and PPC strategies show up to 30% higher CTRs (click-through rates) than non-targeted campaigns.

Now ask yourself: Why spread your budget wide when you can go deep where it counts?

  
**Here’s what hyper-local advertising achieves:**

* Better budget efficiency through more meaningful impressions.
* Increased foot traffic for brick-and-mortar locations.
* Real-time engagement (think happy hour specials or flash sales).
* Lower cost-per-acquisition due to stronger buyer intent.

Many [advertising agencies NYC](https://www.busyseed.com/marketing-agencies-in-new-york-city-key-trends-to-shape-their-success-in-2025) talk a big game, but we back it up with technology and proven results.



# Getting Started: Hyper-Local Advertising the Right Way

If you’re ready to pilot a hyper-local campaign, here’s your step-by-step roadmap:

**1. Define Your Audience**

Not every footstep is worth your ad dollars. Use data to understand who your ideal customer is, where they live, and how often they’re near your business.

**2. Geo-Fence Strategically**

Start small. Geo-fencing your location or a competitor's store lets you see what works before scaling up. SeedGeo offers millimeter-accurate fencing for optimal targeting.

 **3. Create an Offer That Converts**

Hyper-local campaigns perform best when they include a time-sensitive or location-specific incentive: “Free coffee before 10AM” or “20% off for nearby gym members.”

**4. Launch with PPC Management Services**

As one of the [top ad agencies in NYC](https://www.busyseed.com/marketing-agencies-in-new-york-city-key-trends-to-shape-their-success-in-2025), our team of Growth Architects uses precise keywords and real-time bidding strategies to ensure you never overspend or underperform.

Also it's a pour over similar to your standard brew coffee? Also does a pour over have more caffeine? I made a 2 cup pour over in the Aiden and I was bouncing off the walls lol 😂 
The Aiden makes great pour over I did chatgpt and used a guided brew to do the blooms. I can taste the notes in the coffee from Trade.

Company Overview:
Aspire Biopharma Holdings, Inc. is an early-stage biopharmaceutical and supplements company focused on novel sublingual drug delivery technologies, notably a high-dose, fast-acting sublingual aspirin as its lead candidate.

Key Financial Metrics:

- For the six months ended June 30, 2025:
  - Net loss: $(17,922,621) compared to $(327,893) in the prior year period, reflecting increased investment in operations and R&D.

  - Cash: $206,233
  - Total assets: $989,422
  - Total liabilities: $10,606,207 (up from $1,688,077 at Dec. 31, 2024)

  - 49,525,970 shares of common stock outstanding as of September 15, 2025
  - Up to 73,588,712 shares issuable on conversion of notes (registered for resale), potentially greatly diluting current shareholders.
  - Insiders (management and directors) collectively own 25.8% of outstanding shares, with CEO Kraig Higginson holding 21.6%.

Recent Transactions/Developments:

- Completed a business combination with PowerUp Acquisition Corp. in February 2025, resulting in net cash proceeds of $265,827 post transaction costs and liabilities.
- Multiple financing arrangements, including convertible note issuances ($3M+ in gross proceeds), subscription agreements, and an equity line of credit (ELOC) with Arena Business Solutions.
- As of September 17, 2025, $5,887,097 in outstanding convertible promissory notes; up to 147,177,424 shares registered for resale related to these notes.
- Received Nasdaq deficiency notices for minimum market value and bid price requirements in April 2025.

Product Pipeline & Status:

- Lead asset: high-dose, sublingual aspirin, manufactured by Glatt; completed initial bioavailability study in July 2025. NDA submission planned via FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway.
- Other candidates: sublingual formulations of melatonin, vitamins D/E/K, testosterone (patent pending), semaglutide, caffeine, and others in earlier-stage development.
- No product has obtained regulatory approval; no sales revenue to date.

Intellectual Property:

- Patent estate comprised largely of pending applications; key prior patents relating to micronized aspirin have expired.
- New IP filings include PCT/US2024/022318 (pending) and U.S. application 63/702,381 (pending).
- Key trademarks (INSTAPRIN, BUZZ BOMB, COFFEE SHOT, CAFFEINE…ACCELERATED) are pending or lapsed; prior main trademark expired in 2022.

Key Risks:

- History of net losses and accumulated deficit; no expectation of profit in near term.
- Reliant on continued access to external capital; no committed funds, large liabilities, limited cash, and a going concern warning from auditors.
- Material weaknesses identified in internal control over financial reporting.
- Expiry of material patents leaves competitive moat unclear; lead product faces intense competition from established brands (e.g., Bayer, Advil).
- Business highly dependent on single asset (sublingual aspirin); failure to obtain regulatory approval would significantly impair prospects.
- Rapidly increasing operating and financing expenses; significant dilution risk from conversion of existing notes.
- Variability and uncertainty around product development, regulatory environment, and ability to manage commercial launch.
- Potential for delisting from Nasdaq if continued listing requirements are not met.
- Reputation risk from past association with Instaprin Pharmaceuticals, whose former CEO was convicted of investor fraud.

Management & Governance:

- Five-member board; CEO and Chairman is Kraig T. Higginson.
- No cash compensation for non-employee directors; executive employment agreements in place (CEO base salary $180,000, CFO $240,000).
- Emerging Growth Company status under JOBS Act and Smaller Reporting Company designation.

Conclusion:

Aspire Biopharma is a pre-revenue, early-stage drug development company with a novel delivery platform and ambitious pipeline but faces significant financial, operational, regulatory, IP, and dilution risks. Investors should carefully weigh the lack of approved products, heavy reliance on external funding, substantial dilution from convertible securities, and recent material internal control weaknesses against the potential future value of its clinical portfolio.

Sorry in advance for the long post..

I’m 22 and I’ve been suffering with my periods since I started them when I was 14/15. They’ve always been super heavy for as long as I can remember, as well as really painful. - i naturally have quite a high pain threshold (fell 7ft and broke my shoulder when I was 10 and barely made a fuss), so the pain was probably a lot worse looking back. They sometimes used to last two weeks plus, and I’d bleed through clothes and pads, would have to use heavy tampons and change them every couple of hours on the heaviest days- still happens now, just not “as bad”.

I was put on Rigevidon when I was 15 to try and regulate them a bit better. It did work for a while but I still always had a lot of breakthrough bleeding and really painful heavy periods. I was on this for a couple of years until I was 18, and I switched to the Depo injection as I was bad at remembering to take the pill on time, plus I was with my now long term boyfriend and it just seemed easier.

Fast forward a few months on the injection, and I was bleeding constantly, still had really bad periods - intense lower back / pelvic pain, painful AF cramps, bad bloat etc. I was also experiencing painful sex, as well as bleeding during and after. At this point, I decided to go to the GP because I’d just had enough of it all. I saw the doctor and she examined me and did some tests and referred me to the gynaecologist at the hospital (NHS). This is where it gets long…

My first appointment with the consultant was July 2021. I’d explained all of these symptoms and problems I’d been having and she was concerned so ran some more tests. First thing I had was a smear, that came back as normal, so she booked me in for an ultrasound. I had the scan the week after. and she said that a 2mm “polyp” was seen on it. She said that it was very small but that it could’ve been the reason for the bad bleeding, so recommended that I have a hysteroscopy to remove it. So again, said she’d book this in.

Fast forward 9 months later to August 2022 and that’s when the polyp removal procedure happened. Honestly couldn’t believe it took 9 months from the ultrasound to having it done. I chased them up for months and then finally gave up because they just said they had such a massive backlog from Covid, so I just kept waiting for a letter through. Anyways, I finally had the hysteroscopy, and the consultant said that they removed it and it wast a polyp, but it was a blood clot (Not the bad kind I don’t think, could have been old period blood or anything, I can’t remember exactly what she said). After this was done, I was bleeding for a few days, and the bleeding problem wasn’t resolved at all.

The next appointment was December 2022 for a follow up scan from the clot removal. (This is where it gets a bit muddy as I just kinda gave up on recording everything as I was drained). Between December 2022 and November 2024, I’d gone back and forth to see the consultant, and they just had no answers. Scans were clear by what they could see, and blood tests etc.

______________________________________
Between those dates, I’d stopped taking the Depo shot, started taking cerezette, and then ended up stopping contraception all together to try and give my body a break - I was just exhausted with it all. I saw doctor again end of last November, and she booked me in for another scan.
______________________________________

Her recommendation was to use the coil, but (I’m soooo strongly against having one for various reasons, me having ASD being the main one, and hating the idea of things inside my body) and then when I declined that, she suggested HRT of some sort to put me into early menopause for a couple of years with some injections. I thought this sounded kind of whack. But anyways she sent me home with a HRT leaflet, and told me to think about my options, as I should really be on BC at my age. She also said that she’d book me in for a phone appointment for in alter 3 months time.

This ultrasound was a month later in December (2024).

___________________________________

Just relaying back to symptoms: At this point, I’d still been having really painful periods and heavy bleeding etc, and I’d started getting spots a lot - bearing in mind I was 22 at this point not 16. - particularly on forehead and chin, hairline.
___________________________________

I had a text come through 4 months ago (May 2025) with an appointment letter for a phone call follow up from the scan I had in DECEMBER 2024!!! I’d been waiting 5 months at this point for results, a phone call, anything!! My appointment date was for September 2025.

So.. I finally have results from a scan I had almost a year ago.

9 months it has taken them to let me know!! I am just so pissed off, and upset, just feel like no one gives a shit! (Probably should have chased it up more but I was just fed up of being fobbed off, so just couldn’t be arsed). Anyways, I had the phone call last week. The conversation lasted a whole 2 minutes, and she said that on the last scan they showed a cyst. She said that it could possibly be endometriosis related but that they wouldn’t know for definite without a laparoscopy, so that could be an option. I get a bit freaked out on the phone, so I just didn’t ask many questions. I’m just pissed off with myself now for not asking anything, so now I’m just sat here thinking the worst.

She said that she is going to book me in for a follow up scan to see if anything has changed, as it was last year that I had my last ultrasound scan, which showed the cyst. I’ve googled and apparently you can only get cysts in your ovaries, so I’m just a bit worried, and I’m scared that I’m just being a hypochondriac, and that I’ve got PCOS or endo or maybe nothing at all?? Part of me has always thought something was wrong with all this but now I’m just doubting myself and half expecting the new scan to comeback as normal, and then I’m just back to square one. I’m in one mind to ask for the surgery to see if it’s endo, but worried that too could just come back normal.

___________________________________

Relaying back to symptoms etc:

Since November 2024, I’d been tracking my “periods” on flow, to try and see if they were coming back to normal after coming off BC. After stopping it, the bleeding had kinda slowed down, and then stopped altogether for a few months. I’d been off it around a year at this point, and I had my first bleed, it lasted 5 days but was still painful as usual and heavy AF. The next time I had a bleed was 3 months later in February 2025, roughly around the same time. Skipped it completely in March, and the next one was in April and it lasted 4 days. I had another end of May, which again was 5 days long. At this point, I figured oh my god I’m fixed!!!

But that was the last proper “period” I’ve had. I missed one in July completely, and pretty much all of August. At the end of August, I started spotting, and it lasted about 5/6 days, but it wasn’t like a normal period. I didn’t much discomfort, and the bleed was mainly brown/black looking, kinda like coffee grounds texture. I’d had a few weird looking clots too, but nothing big. I just assumed I was coming on my period, so this was all just the lead up to it after having skipped a few
__________________________________

So in all, I’m kinda worried it could be any number of things:

PCOS endometriosis amenorrhea/ Menorrhagia Hormone imbalance

I’m just so fed up and ready to give up with the hospital lol. This has been going on for almost 6 years now, it just seems like I’m never going to get the answers I’m looking for. Do I opt for the endometriosis surgery and hope that there’s a that something there that can explain the last 8 years of this shit.

Last thing- Can I request the scan notes at all? I feel like I just want to read it for myself and see what’s what?

Any advice, similar stories/experiences, or even just some kind words would go a long way.

Thank you if you took the time to read all of this. ",1,1758244434.0,Periods,0,1.0,False
1nkq1a6,https://i.redd.it/i64hkk18v0qf1.png,explaining Kenny's lore (also I need help with something),"so yeah I was wondering what voice would sound fitting for kenny just based on his lore and overall vibe so if your okay with it please leave suggestions in the comments on a voice that might fit him anyways ONTO THE LOREEEEEEEEEEEE

so detective Kenny Franklin Carter was born in 1938 in Boston Massachusetts and at the age of five was abandoned by his parents leaving him to the foster system in which he grew up alongside two other men who he considers and calls his brothers (will make a post on them later on), growing up he never had a father figure same as his two brothers leading to this feeling that he needed to prove himself because he never really knew his dad all too well and had this feeling in the back of his mind that he wasn't good enough which is why he was abandoned

cutting over to his adult life he became a cop at the age of 20 and served four years as a successful police officer in LA during that time he would act arrogantly, reckless and dismissive presenting himself as the best of the best and in 1962 he went alone to a drug bust believing he would be enough alone he ended up being wrong to an insane degree and was shot in the stomach point blank with a shotgun causing him to bleed out and die.

for his arrogance he was sent to hell and not knowing what to do took up work as a private detective and mercenary which he became well known for throughout the 70's and 80's until he was given the job of investigating Carmilla Carmine leading to a fight between the two ending in a draw and eventually creating a friendly rivalry with both of them respecting one another until one day he was offered a truce by Carmilla in exchange for resources such as angelic weaponry and a backing from her business leading to the two meeting and eventually over time falling for one another going on their first date in 2005 giving Kenny a sense of belonging and eventually he proposed to her leading to the two of them marrying

during this time Kenny sold his soul to Alastor whilst drunk and stressed becoming an ally of the hotel and considered an honorary overlord not official but the closest he could really get to being one

anyways thats his whole backstory and shit now I want to get onto various things I have about Kenny and such

he is incredibly snarky and often pisses off overlords such as the vees with his comments about them

he is close friends with zestial and goes bowling with him every Wednesday night

at first his relationship with Carmilla's daughters clara and odette was horrible but eventually they came around and started to view him as a genuine father figure

he was encouraged to propose by one of his brothers who ended up in hell (the other one ended up in heaven)

his fighting style is pretty much that of captain america using a shield (look it sounds fun and unique compared to something like another swordsman or marksman)

1nkq0wi,https://i.redd.it/nd9mlrchu0qf1.png,"""Pull It Forward"" - Story and Narration","Hey all, still doing narrations while I dance for the Algorithm Gods. Here's todays, plus the story, let me know what you think. Likes are excellent and all that jazz.

[https://youtu.be/Ns2KGibzdKA?si=SywkGwICsTwvK5IS](https://youtu.be/Ns2KGibzdKA?si=SywkGwICsTwvK5IS)



**Pull It Forward**

So like a lot of people these days, I have a superpower. In my case, I can pull random objects out of the past and into the present, into my hands. Nothing too crazy, as superpowers go, right? Yeah, before pulling the last one, I'd have said so too.

I can't just do it whenever. And by that, I mean I can't just do it wherever. You pull something out standing over here, you can't ever do it there again. It's not about exact distances either, like you gotta go fifty meters that way before you can get something else. More a kind of...feeling of potential, a sense that an area hasn't been worn-out in some way. It's instinctive. Maybe dragging things through time weakens the fabric of the universe somehow, and this is how reality sort of defends itself?

Who knows. Ever since the Silver Shower when all those meteors fell to Earth, various scientists and kooks have been trying to figure out how the whole ""superpower"" thing works. So far without a lot of luck, but hey, it's only been a few years.

I don't use my power to fight crime. I mean, obviously. Even if I could control what I got, or had some sort of lucky ""exactly what you need in the moment"" thing going, I don't know how useful it would be. Yay, an iron sword. Let's use it to run at this dude who shoots lightning out of his eyeballs. That's just gonna turn out great for everyone.

Nah. I use it to make money. Archaeologists sometimes, governments mostly. Nationalist types. They hire me to go to known sites and ruins and snatch nice fresh artifacts out of the air. It can be interesting, but mostly it's just a living. I end up tossing a lot of rocks and bricks and shitty pottery aside. Because, like, an ancient clay vase is interesting, until you have fifty of them, and since they don't carbon-date as old they're not that different to what some talented college kid could turn out on a potter's wheel in the basement of the campus Fine Arts Building. But sure, sometimes it's some old weapon or helmet, or a variety of perishable object they've never seen before.

So I spend a lot of time in old places and luxury hotels. Honestly, until today I was feeling pretty damn grateful about my ticket in the Superpower Lottery. I wasn't being conscripted to fight some dickhead in a stupid costume with delusions of grandeur. And I didn't have any major delusions of my own, at least so far as I could tell. Powers made some people go all the way off the deep end, like we're talking mentally mid-ocean here. Me, I was fine. Sane, rich, semi-interesting job, hard to complain.

But this place, man. No. No no no. First of all, it's too damn cold. Even with all the gear they gave me. Yes, I'm being well-paid, and yes, I shouldn't have expected any different from the freaking Arctic in the first place. I don't care. You'd complain too. Because this place is unsettling as all Hell.

They found it because everything was melting, from what I understood. It didn't make the news, some team of superpowered do-gooders were there after some other superpowered type who'd gotten it in his meteor-muck head to build a base on the polar ice cap. Which, as everyone is perfectly aware, is melting. They have their fight, they calve a few dozen new icebergs in the process, the crazy dies in some dramatic self-inflicted fashion, pretty usual scene these days. But they also spot something. Under the ice.

I hate it. I hate looking down and seeing it. It's unsettling. You can make out the outlines, but that's all. And what you can make out, it's maybe a city, maybe a temple site, but the proportions are all wrong, and the lines don't follow right. I don't know any other way to put it. They have me walking all over, clunking these heavy boots across this half-transparent window into I-don't-want-to-know. They tell me they've tried radar and sonic imaging but whatever we can see down there, it just absorbs it, comes back black. Not useful black, like words on a page, shitty fuck-you black, like a printer where the toner cartridge has decided to go out in the most spiteful way possible.

And I can't pull anything. It's like...trying to pull your boot out of a meter-deep mud puddle. There's stuff there, it just...won't. But I keep trying, because I want to get paid, because I want all this to be good for something.

I can't pull anything, until I do. And that's when the trouble started. It was a long thing, like a kind of pole, only it twisted. By that I mean several things. One, you could turn its various segments into different configurations. Two, there was that thing with the lines again, where they just didn't follow, only now up close instead of seen through meters and meters of ice, it hurt your eyes. I decided right away just not to look at it. And three...it moved by itself. Spun when you let go of it, different sections at different rates. Not in midair, not quite; if you dropped it, it'd fall until one end hit the ground.

But then it'd stop, just twisting there at whatever angle it had already been at.

They were fascinated by it. The scientists, I mean. Saying it was clearly some tech, maybe a crashed UFO buried for God knew how long. What I knew, meanwhile, is that I wanted to be somewhere else. Somewhere warm, with hot chocolate or coffee or tea. Maybe a little brandy. And fresh socks. So...I was. Somewhere else. Tucked away in a cozy room when it all happened.

I can't look at them, not any more than I could look at the thing I pulled. They're all twisted now too. Not literally, not like you're thinking maybe, I could handle that I think. Hate it, but handle it. No, they're...something else now. Or they were. They're dead, I think. I hope. So I'm going to wait here until someone comes. The radios don't work, but maybe that's good, right? No one's heard from us, they'll know there's trouble, they'll come.

I just hope some*one* comes before some*thing* does.

I don't like thinking about what I can hear beneath the ice.

1nkq0ht,https://i.redd.it/xrrhk840v0qf1.png,explaining Kenny's lore (also I need help with something),"so yeah I was wondering what voice would sound fitting for kenny just based on his lore and overall vibe so if your okay with it please leave suggestions in the comments on a voice that might fit him anyways ONTO THE LOREEEEEEEEEEEE

so detective Kenny Franklin Carter was born in 1938 in Boston Massachusetts and at the age of five was abandoned by his parents leaving him to the foster system in which he grew up alongside two other men who he considers and calls his brothers (will make a post on them later on), growing up he never had a father figure same as his two brothers leading to this feeling that he needed to prove himself because he never really knew his dad all too well and had this feeling in the back of his mind that he wasn't good enough which is why he was abandoned

cutting over to his adult life he became a cop at the age of 20 and served four years as a successful police officer in LA during that time he would act arrogantly, reckless and dismissive presenting himself as the best of the best and in 1962 he went alone to a drug bust believing he would be enough alone he ended up being wrong to an insane degree and was shot in the stomach point blank with a shotgun causing him to bleed out and die.

for his arrogance he was sent to hell and not knowing what to do took up work as a private detective and mercenary which he became well known for throughout the 70's and 80's until he was given the job of investigating Carmilla Carmine leading to a fight between the two ending in a draw and eventually creating a friendly rivalry with both of them respecting one another until one day he was offered a truce by Carmilla in exchange for resources such as angelic weaponry and a backing from her business leading to the two meeting and eventually over time falling for one another going on their first date in 2005 giving Kenny a sense of belonging and eventually he proposed to her leading to the two of them marrying

during this time Kenny sold his soul to Alastor whilst drunk and stressed becoming an ally of the hotel and considered an honorary overlord not official but the closest he could really get to being one

anyways thats his whole backstory and shit now I want to get onto various things I have about Kenny and such

he is incredibly snarky and often pisses off overlords such as the vees with his comments about them

he is close friends with zestial and goes bowling with him every Wednesday night

at first his relationship with Carmilla's daughters clara and odette was horrible but eventually they came around and started to view him as a genuine father figure

he was encouraged to propose by one of his brothers who ended up in hell (the other one ended up in heaven)

his fighting style is pretty much that of captain america using a shield (look it sounds fun and unique compared to something like another swordsman or marksman)

he has both autism and adhd

his first date with carmilla consisted of them getting coffee and a walk around the entertainment district of hell

he has a massive rivalry with the three vees specifically velvette

when he fights he cracks jokes and will normally have a cocky smirk on his face as he does so

1nkpza0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KundaliniAwakening/comments/1nkpza0/month_2_kundaliniwork_report_journal/,Month 2 kundalini-work report journal,"Hello everybody, I hope all are well. I just figured I'd pipe in with a kind of report of sorts as to where kundalini has gone in the intervening month just to provide a record of what has been going on.

**General Observations**:

**1. Energy patterns**: In my case, the movement of energy begins with buzzing in the left leg. It is a somewhat numb, slightly uncomfortable, seeming 'staging point' for energy work. It seems to then travel to where it needs to go with a kind of surgical precision, and is almost always accompanied by a sensation in the groin. Then it moves, dislodges or melts an energic knot somewhere, and then returns to the left leg. Whenever a major piece of movement is going to occur, the sensation in the left leg grows correspondingly greater, as if energy has been freed up for it in preparation. These flows of energy tend to be very enjoyable the time of, but less so in the aftermath, as once the problem is dealt with in the subtle body, it is purged in the physical one- which means various ailments.

**2. Sensitivity to foods/beverages**: I find that certain foods are no goes. Meat has been fine, and sometimes my body exhibits a specific craving for it. However, processed treats and so on are a big no-no. I've also developed an aversion to alcohol, even though I like the taste of wine personally. Coffee is something I still enjoy, but in far smaller quantities. Outside of this my diet is generally quite healthy, so I've been doing ok. Cashew nuts are now a firm favorite. I find I need to eat a lot more in order to feel satisfied.

**3. Less frequent, but occasional ""UFO""-type celestial sounds:** This has happened to me on two different nights, and is usually very limited. I might wake up deep in the night, when this slight UFO type noise of sorts begins ringing slightly in my ears. The first time it vanished, the second time I tried to see if I could reach out to it. I said ""Come and stay a while pal!"" somewhat jokingly (or something like that) and felt this immense surge of ecstatic, rapturous bliss 'grip me' for about 15 seconds. It then left, together with the sound. Then I conked out as I was tired and had work the next day haha.

**4. General sensation of swooning**: My body is naturally doing this, for example at work. It just feels like this undulating sense that I am being moved about from an axis at my lower spine. The spine is also generally far more flexible I feel.

**5. Chatting to my family and hanging out with friends has been absolutely crucial**: While sometimes I need to be alone to deal with this, I find that doing too much of that is counter-productive. When and where possible, I try to chat normally with people as well, even as I know it's hard to explain things to them. Remembering that I am ultimately just also who I am has been a very healthy mentality for me going through this, as it is gradually ramping up in energic tenor.

**6. Being told I look healthy**: This might seem weird, but many have remarked that (even as I feel kind of crappy internally at times) that I seemingly look very healthy. I am not aware necessarily, but it has been nice to receive the compliment. It could just be dropping alcohol though lol. Physically, I feel quite healthy, and kundalini tends to help release blockages and is balancing the body.

**7. Changes to appearance of light during kundalini movement**: When the energy moves through the body, subtle alterations to the lighting where I am take place. They tend to move between a kind of vivid clarity and their original appearance. It is not unpleasant, but tends to resolve once the work is done for the time being. Otherwise everything looks very much the same as usual.

**8. Praying at shrine**: Near where I live there is a shrine devoted to a Goddess with roots in Hinduism. Praying here has often been quite helpful in calming my worst fears and providing me with peace of mind.

**9. Illnesses are less intense**: Pretty self-explanatory.

**10.** **Quiet seated meditation helps kundalini move faster**: I only do it however when I am feeling physically, mentally, and emotionally stable. The way I look at it is that in meditation you can tap into the aspect of God that is the unchanging- or Shiva in the pair with Shakti. Almost in response, Shakti rises to 'catch up' to the experiences inside the meditation. So when at balance, I meditate to get a bit deeper in my mind, and Shakti comes accordingly. I find it is a very bad idea to meditate when a lot of active work is going on as it is destabilizing.

**Challenges:**

**1. OCD-type fear of Christianity and Jesus**: Navigating OCD tendencies while this has been going on have been a bit of a challenge. Sometimes when the energy is active and or in an integrative state, my mind, not knowing how to make deal with all of this, obsessively attaches energy to fears of Christianity. I tend to have a kind of anxious-kundalini resonance with thoughts of the Christian faith/Jesus, which I can kind of understand, but I know for a fact that I suffer from OCD, so these two areas are dovetailing together. It feels like my resistance is tied to a desire to control things, which I accept is a losing battle. I think a lot of this resistance is itself the cause of my consternation, so trying to accept it has been challenging. When the energy is rising and powering through the body, the anxiety tends to disappear into a total confidence that all is ok. When I am integrating and going through a rough patch, the anxiety tends to intensify. This models however -exactly- the same patterns I've had in other OCD-type experiences, so I am just working through it. I'm sure all of it will work out in the end, so while at times unpleasant, I'm not too worried.

**2. Physical symptoms when processing energy:** When some energy at the third eye region got 'melted' this then got followed up with a soreness in the nasal passage (where the tongue goes in khechari mudra ). Similarly, when work in the heart or throat goes on, I have a lot of mucous that my body wants to get out of my body. These purgative episodes are akin to being physically sick.

**3. Resisting at all**: Resistance is what my obsessive thoughts are. When ego has less to hold on with, it doubles its frantic attempts to continue to understand, think, be rigid. The secret is, and always was, to push less. I understand this is likely part of the work, but all of this can be exhausting.",2,1758244220.0,KundaliniAwakening,0,1.0,False
1nkpz9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1nkpz9t/why_do_people_go_out_of_their_way_to_be_unpleasant/,Why do people go out of their way to be unpleasant?,"I think I've summarized my post pretty well. I feel like people these days do everything within their power to be unpleasant, in the best case scenario, or downright bitches in the worst. Since all posts must be a tale, I'll use an example that is currently happening to me to illustrate what I mean by this.

Basically, as I think happens in most hotels, graveyard shift goes from 7pm to 7am and, unfortunately for me, it's my fixated shift to work. In comes these guests, who booked their room last minute.

First, she goes on a rant with the valet that, I shit you not, the caps to their tires valves have been taken. Thankfully, she checked in earlier, but her car hadn't been checked in, which means it hadn't even gone to our parking lot, and the valets haven't even touched the car yet. Also thankfully, the valet who works these shifts with me is a no nonsense middle aged man, so he bluntly tells her ""she should check the places she parks, because, since the car hasn't been checked in, no one besides them have touched it"". She seems displeased, but carries on.

Now I haven't gone 30 minutes without a call from them. First, they can't find the menu to order from our restaurant. I inform her it's in the QR Code on top of the table. I overhear her asking her friend if ""there is a menu on the table"". When the friend denies and she says it to me, I then, once again, repeat that it's IN THE QR CODE on the table. She complains that her phone is nearly dying and she can't scan it (apparently chargers aren't a thing any longer?). Begrudgingly (internally, of course), I tell her I'll ask someone to bring a printed copy up to her room.

Then she calls to order from room service. She wants two cappuccinos, but she also wants toasts and biscuits, which we do not offer with cappuccinos (long story really). I inform her, but offer an alternative: she can order a thermal bottle of coffee and toasts and a simple thermal of milk, and then she'll have the toasts. She accepts, hangs up. Calls back a minute later to ask for blisters of butter (which we already send up, as informed on the menu) and extra plates. I say I'll send them up.

Fifteen minutes later, she calls to say her shampoo bottle isn't working. Now, our bottles are attached to the wall, because we've had countless instances of amenities theft and the brand we carry is slightly expensive. Also, they're those types of bottles with a safety lock, the ones you have to twist left/right to lock/unlock. I inform her, and she insists it's broken. I go up to the room with a new one and lo and behold, the current one was simply set to lock. I literally just twisted it to the side and it was working again.

Just as I reach the front desk, she calls again. I swear to God, it's been so many times already that I don't even recall what she needs this time. All I know is that, when I hung up, I jokingly bet with the valet that the next call would be hers. Not even five minutes later, she calls again to request more butter blisters, sweeteners for her drink (even though it's already been sent), an extra mug and plate.

Now, I don't really mind tending to guests' needs, but can't you just call once and request all you'll need at once? And try to solve your problems on your own before calling the front desk? Despite what some people think, I'm not sitting on my ass scrolling on Reddit (pun intended), so please, PLEASE, be as considerate of our time as you'd expect us to be of yours.

EDIT: I just remembered another small example. Guest arrived at the front desk, speaking English. Now, this is a common occurrence, even though we're a non English speaking country, since we get guests from all over the place. But this guest was from our country and, as soon as the FDA replied to her greeting also in English, she introduced herself as our same nationality and switched back to our language. Oh, and she also didn't bring any form of ID either because ""she was traveling abroad"". Make that make sense.",13,1758244220.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,8,0.88,False

Literally the same dream and it was super vivid. Anyone have any idea as to why?","So this is my recurring dream. I don't know why, for the last week, I have had this exact dream every single night. The details are the same every time, down to the pattern of the northern lights and even the meals we have. I have no idea if it's a sign or something but every time I wake up I'm almost panicking looking for her and wondering what happened to everything.  (Names, dates and some details changed in case I end up putting this on Reddit)          

A little background and people descriptions. Myself, for the sake of the story I'll use the name John  I'm 31M , shy, straight 6'1"" roughly 245lbs, little heavy but muscular underneath,  the girl I reconnect with, we'll say Jennifer, 5'5"" 29F Also shy, straight, I'm bad with guessing weight so I'll guess like 140-145lbs, healthy build, she has a son, 7 years old, let's call him Thomas. It starts with myself reconnecting with someone I used to talk to all the time and me falling again for them, even though she's made it clear that she isn't interested in a relationship at the current time.  The first 20 or so minutes of the dream is kind of a blur of 10ish months to roughly a year where we start talking more and she admits that she's been starting to get feelings for me and we start seeing each other then started officially started dating after a couple months and the relationship flourished and eventually she moved in with me. By the time the first year or 20 minutes of the dream is over, we are happily living together and planning our first vacation together up to my families camp on a small lake in Maine, way up towards the border of Canada,  which is where the good part of the story begins.         

Day 1: August 28th, I wake up just before my 6AM alarm, a slight chill to the air outside, no one else is awake in the house, I roll over and see Jennifer laying next to me, a single ray of light coming in through our bedroom window just missing her closed eyes. ""Glad that isn't in her eyes, she's probably still exhausted from loading up the truck with me last night"" I think to myself. I lean over and kiss her on the cheek and still blush like that first time I kissed her when I was so nervous I almost missed. I climb out of bed, get dressed, black tee shirt with a local motor builders logo on it and a pair of blue jeans, I do so quietly  and silence my alarm so she can sleep a bit longer. I head downstairs and start a  cup of coffee for myself, medium roast with fresh milk from the farm and a spoonful of sugar. I then put her pod in the coffee pot and her favorite mug under the spout, light roast and put her favorite creamer at the front of the top shelf on the fridge.  I hear light footsteps upstairs then coming down the stairs. Her son appears in the doorway to the kitchen."" Good morning Mr. John"" ""Morning Tommy. Are you ready for the big trip today"" I ask after a sip of my coffee. He looks at me, still half asleep and smiles saying ""Yea I am but momma said its a long drive away. How far is a long drive?"" he asks, while looking to see what cereal we have in the pantry. He chooses fruity pebbles and as I'm pouring him a bowl of them I tell him ""it's about a 12 hour drive. So if we leave at 7 this morning we will be in the truck till 7 tonight"" ""Oh man, I hope momma charged my tablet cause that's almost forever"" Tommy says before taking a big bite of his breakfast. As he's eating his breakfast  I hear Jennifer coming down the stairs so I start brewing her coffee. She pokes her head into the kitchen and says ""there's my favorite guys, I'm gonna shower quick so if anyone needs the bathroom, hustle"" I stand there almost half leaning against the kitchen sink, just lost in her absolute beauty, wondering how I could have ever gotten so lucky to have her in my life. She looks at me and says ""earth to John"" I snap out of my daze and ask what she said. ""I asked you to make my coffee when it's done brewing space cadet. You get that look every time I walk in the room."" I blush again and say I can make it. She give's me a smile and says ""I love you"" ""I love you too"" I reply. She goes back around the corner across the dining room to get in the shower. ""You're in love with my momma aren't you"" tommy pipes up from his bowl of cereal. ""More than you'll ever know buddy"" I say as I ruffle his hair ""that's why this vacation is gonna be so incredible, you and your momma are gonna get to spend a week where I used to go every summer when I was your age all the way through when I graduated high school"" I tell him. I make Jen's coffee and help tommy clean up from his breakfast and tell him to go grab some of his favorite stuffed animals for the trip. As he hurries back up the stairs, Jen comes out of the bathroom to the kitchen in a pair of black yoga pants and a gray tee shirt cause I told her to dress comfortable for the trip. She walks by her mug on the counter and walks right to me and wraps me in a hug and I feel the world melt away around me as I hug her back and hold her close. We share a short, sweet kiss and she thanks me for making her coffee and she walks over and grabs it, taking the first sip, I see her shoulders relax and a smile tug at her lips. ""Perfect as usual"" she says sweetly. ""Is everything ready to leave?"" she asks between sips. As I put my empty cup in the sink, I turn to her and give a nod. ""Tommy is upstairs grabbing a couple stuffed animals for the trip"" I say as we hear him coming back down the stairs. He rounds the corner with a few stuffed animals including a little bear I had gotten him for Christmas. Jen and Tommy start heading out to the truck as I do a final walkthrough of the house making sure all the lights and fans are off. I glance outside and see tommy getting buckled into his booster seat. I go back to the computer room and open my small safe and take out a small, black velvet box and open it. Inside is the most beautiful golden ring with the perfectly cut Amethyst you'd ever lay your eyes on. This was gonna be a week that none of us would soon forget. I close the box and tuck it into my last bag to load in the truck. I get into the truck and put the address into the GPS and we set off for the back country. Most of the drive is uneventful, cruise control set at 75 and the truck just rolls along, playlist just scrolling for hours with the occasional rest stop and fuel stop cause, well its a full size truck with a V8 (2020 Ram 1500, deep crimson color). After roughly 11 hours of traveling, we arrive at my aunt and uncles house (we talked beforehand and decided it would be smarter to go there the night we arrived so we weren't trying to setup at the camp while exhausted from traveling all day) We get out of the truck and I get tommy out of the backseat and carry him since he is fully passed out. We approach the door and my uncle opens it and greets us with open arms in his usual eccentric way. ""you guys look exhausted from the drive, that's why we usually fly when we come down for a visit"" Jen and I exchange looks with a smile as he keeps rambling on about everything and showing us to the room we will be spending the first night in. I brought Tommy into the bedroom my cousin used to sleep in and put him on the bed with his stuffed animal and a blanket and take his shoes off. Jen comes in and we tuck him in. We walk back into the living room and I give a proper introduction of Jen to my Aunt Lisa and Uncle Frank. Aunt Lisa, being the gabby old lady she is, sits down on the couch with Jen and starts asking the normal questions you would expect family to ask. Uncle frank motions for me to go with him out to the front porch so I follow. As soon as we are outside and out of earshot he turns and smiles at me and asks ""do you think she knows what's gonna happen this week"" I reply ""I hope she doesn't, I want it to be a surprise for her."" We walk over to the truck and I look to make sure the coast is clean and I show him the ring. He smiles and puts a hand on my shoulder and says ""I remember when you were just a young lad coming up here every summer, always working on a project with me or your cousin in the shop or helping with the airstrip outback, I never thought you would settle down."" I looked down at my feet then up to the stars and smiled and said ""I thought the same, Jen is truly and amazing woman and has showed me how to be loved and love genuinely. I couldn't imagine life without her."" Just then the door pops open and Jen asks if I could grab her water bottle out of the truck and I yell back ""absolutely I can sweety"" She closes the door and I look at uncle Frank and we burst out laughing about how the surprise was almost spoiled day one. As we turned to head back into the house, high above there was a faint light dancing as if knowing, it was almost their time to shine.         

Day 2: August 29th. I wake up, roughly 8:15AM, Jen is out like a light next to me, lightly snoring, but still as beautiful as the day I first laid eyes on her. I climbed out of bed and as usual, kissed her cheek. I get dressed, a blue tee shirt with a local off roading events logo on it and a pair of black denim jeans then I walked out of the room into the hallway and headed for the kitchen and hear tiny footsteps run up behind me and tommy hugs me from behind and asks ""where are we, this doesn't look like a camp"" I explained to him that while he was sleeping in the truck we figured it would be easier to spend the first night at my aunt and uncles house. as we walk into the kitchen, Frank is making pancakes on the griddle. He glances over and says good morning to us and keeps cooking. ""Hi Tommy, you can call me grandpa Frank if you want, I'm Johns uncle"" Tommy looks at me and whispers ""can I just call him Mr. Frank"" I whisper back ""ask him, not me bud"" as I stand to make my coffee. Tommy then asks and and uncle frank says ""you sure can, now how many pancakes would you like"" I start making my coffee as the conversation continues between Frank and Tommy. Aunt Lisa comes up to me and says ""Jen and I had a wonderful conversation last night even though she was quite tired"" she the leans in and said ""frank told me about the ring"" and she pats me on the shoulder and goes about her morning routine.  After a couple sips of my coffee, I start one for Jen out of habit and roughly a minute later she comes walking down the hallway. Her hair was a bit of a mess but still perfect. She motioned for me to come over so I walked over, hugged her and gave her a kiss on the cheek ""what's up sweety"" I ask she shyly looks around and whispers in my ear ""where is the bathroom"" I chuckle lightly and point her back down the hall to the door next to the room we slept in and told her ""that door"" She nods and quickly turns around and sleepily shuffles down the hallway. I return to the kitchen and put her creamer in her coffee and stir it. A few moments later she walks back into the kitchen, picks up her coffee takes a sip and asks ""why is the heat on, it's August?"" Frank and myself laugh and he says ""Welcome to Maine sweetheart"" as he points at the thermometer on the widow above the sink. 45 degrees outside. Jen's eyes open a bit more and she says ""I'll be right back"" she sets her coffee on the counter and goes back down the hallway towards our room. Frank puts a few pancakes on her plate and I set her coffee next to it and we both chuckle a bit and she comes back into the kitchen wearing my sweatpants and says ""much better"" as she sits next to Tommy and starts eating her pancakes. Frank and I start talking about the camp and how its about an hour drive cause nothing is close in northern Maine. He tells me that the camp to the left of the one we are staying at is my other Uncle Charles and Aunt Kayla and then the camp to the right is some long time friends of the family and everyone is excited to meet Jen and reconnect with me since I haven't been up there in 10 plus years. As we get ready to leave after breakfast and everyone using the restroom, we head for the door and uncle frank stops us and says come to the living room window so we all walk over and in the yard next to my truck is a massive moose just walking across the yard. I smile remembering the many summers seeing them up here but Jen, having never been to Maine, Has never seen one before and is taking video on her phone with this look of amazement in her eyes. We watch for a couple more minutes as he continues across the yard and into the woods behind the house. Tommy turns to me and asks ""can we come up here every summer"" with the same look of awe in his eyes as his mother. Frank says ""you guys are welcome to come up whenever you want, You're family"" as we head to the door I look at him and he gives a nervous smile and we both chuckle because they are not technically family yet, soon though. We then travel and hour across the backwoods down small roads, over creeks and down some roads that didn't even show up on the GPS. When we arrived at the lake, there was an overwhelming sense of relaxation. No cell service, no noise from the road, just nature. We pulled into our camp, a small cabin about 30 yards from the lakeshore and I see a slight smile on Jens face as she undoes her seatbelt and starts to get out of the truck. I climb out and help Tommy out of his seat and we walk around to the other side and join his mother in the sunlight and warmth. We spend the next 20 minutes moving out luggage into the cabin, Including the now useless cellphones and our wallets and opening up the windows to let the fresh air in. As we unload the truck uncle Frank walks up and hands me a small case from under the seat of his truck and calls Jen and Tommy over. ""I know you already know this"" pointing to me ""but I wanna give everyone this knowledge"" he gives a 10 minute speech about food safety and not leaving even a crumb out cause bears can smell it and may come looking for food. He hands me the small case and a key for it ""it was your grandfathers, when you leave, drop it back off at the house"" I nodded knowing exactly what it was. Tommy got his swim trunks on and we went down to the lake for a bit. Jen and I stood knee deep in the water, me with my jeans rolled up and her back in her shorts she'd had on first thing this morning when she woke up,  feeling the semi cold water, slightly warmed from the sun, flow back and forth and relaxing. I wrapped her in a hug and she hugged back and said ""this is really nice but I'm hoping it warms up a bit"" Tommy was sitting in the water on a little log and splashing ""the water is fine momma, you just gotta dive in"" Almost sensing my devious smile, she goes to pull from the hug and turn to me as I said ""yea momma, dive in"" and started to pull both of us into the water. She caught her balance and I ended up falling in. Yea I wont lie, that water was cold but not as cold as I expected. Jen laughed as did Tommy and my uncle from the shoreline. I sat back and lounged out and just sat there with a smile on my face. ""Jen you should join me, it's not that bad."" She walked over next to me, looked at the sand in the water and said ""I have an idea"" and sat on my lap, as usual I blushed and smiled and laid my head on her back. She said ""this way I don't get all sandy first thing in the morning"" I thought to myself ""fair point"" we sat there for probably a half hour while Tommy kept playing in the water near us.  A few moments later, We looked back towards the shore and the folks in the other camps were waking up so we decided to get out of the water and go say good morning to everyone. As we walked up uncle Charles came hobbling over and gave me a big hug saying ""its been almost 15 years since I've seen you young man, How have you been?"" ""I've been good, better in the last year"" as I feel Jen walk up next to me and put her arm around my waist, ""this is Jennifer and the young man sitting on that stump by the firepit is her son Thomas"" I explained to him as Aunt Kayla walked over and right past me to hug Jen ""well hello to you too aunty"" I say holding my arms out to hug the air as Charles starts laughing ""your folks said you guys were coming up and Kayla has been excited to meet the young lady who got her nephew to become a family man"" As he's saying this I turn and Aunt Kayla has Jen in a hug and is talking her ear off but Jen looks so comfortable meeting my family, further confirming that she is the one. The older couple that was long time friends of the family at the next camp over stopped by as we were getting ready for lunch and shared stories of when I was just a little lad and told me about my family history further back than I knew. We all had subs for lunch and sat around for the afternoon just talking about everything under the sun. We ended up back in the lake for a couple hours in the afternoon when it was a bit warmer. Tommy stayed by the shore with the older folks and they were building sand castles and talking about school and how times have changed. Jen and I were a little ways into the lake, shoulder deep just staring into each others eyes smiling when she said ""I wouldn't mind coming back up here every summer for a week to get away from everything back home, Like frank said Were family at this point"" I blushed and we both giggled. She then asked the question I had been waiting for since we arrived. ""so we've been all through the cabin and I noticed something is missing from inside. Where is the bathroom?"" At this, I laughed out loud and said follow me. So we swam back to the shore and walked up behind the cabin and there before us, a true rustic outhouse. She looked and me, then it, then back to  me and kinda pushed her knees together and said ""please tell me your kidding, like please"" I looked at her and said ""This is real, we're roughing it this week"" She looked at me and was like ""this isn't gonna be fun but I still wanna come back every summer"" then opened the door, looked back and shooed me away while I chuckled. I walked over to the truck and grabbed the fresh package of toilet paper I had grabbed before we left, took out a roll and went back over to the outhouse. She knows me too well cause as I walked up, the door opened a crack and her arm appeared and said ""thank you hun"" ""no worries sweety"" I replied as I walked back down to the shoreline to see everyone else. We were discussing dinner plans for the evening when Jen rejoined us. ""Perfect timing, you can help peel potatoes for the home made fries while we start the burgers on the grill. We had a large dinner that night and all watched the sunset across the lake. ""I'm gonna get a fire goin in the pit if you guys wanna grab some logs from the pile"" uncle Charles said pointing towards a pile between the camps. Jen and I grabbed a few logs to start for the fire as the older folks were setting up chairs around the pit. We sat there till Tommy fell asleep and Jen had me carry him to the cabin then we returned to the fire. We all sat around, chatting about life and our goals and then my aunt asked me to tell the story of how Jen and I met and I said that'll be a story for tomorrow night as it's getting late and the fire is almost out. We all agreed and called it a night. As we closed up the cabin and got the little woodstove goin for heat that night, a few sparks flew up and out the chimney and joined the northern lights, just a little brighter this night.         

Day 3: August 30th The Big Day. 630AM I didn't sleep much that night, part excitement about what I had planned and part reloading the woodstove every couple hours. I opened the shades and the sun was just tickling the tops of the trees on the far side of the woods behind the camps. Tommy was sleeping like a rock on his  little bed with his stuffed animals and a couple blankets and Jen was snuggled up in her sleeping bag under the covers. I looked at her, my heart filled with joy as I leaned in and kissed her forehead.  On the little counter, I had plugged the coffee pot into the one outlet in the cabin. I started my coffee then set up Jens for when she woke up. I walked outside and it was quiet. The birds were just waking up, all was right in the world. A single loon was out on the water making small ripples and he floated along. I took a sip of my coffee and stood there for a long moment, just then Jen walked up beside me with her coffee and laid her head on my shoulder and said ""good morning hun"" I turned my head and kissed the top of hers and said ""good morning sweety"" we walked over and sat down at the fire pit and drank our coffees while talking about how the trip has been so far and she said despite the outhouse she was having a wonderful time. We heard stirring in the cabin as Tommy woke up wondering why people stay in cabins when normal houses exist and we hear him complain about almost everything. Kids right? I then hear stirring over at the next camp and Aunt Kayla came over and sat with us and asked Jen how she liked the slower pace from the life we lived back home. Jen starred out across the lake watching the shadows get shorter and smiled and said ""so far I have no complaints, I haven't been this free from my life in a long time. No work calls, no people bugging me constantly. I can relax and not worry"" She put her head on my shoulder, took my hand and looked at me ""I have you to thank for this, I haven't been this happy in a while"" Just then Tommy came out of the cabin, walked over and climbed into my lap,  hugged his moms neck and said ""momma, you look happy, like for real happy"" and laid his head on my chest and thanked me for his mom being happy cause it made him happy. I could see Jen and aunt Kayla both starry eyed at this moment. I sat there smiling and said ""I will do whatever it takes to keep your momma this happy bud"" and rubbed his back.  About 15 minutes later uncle Charles poked his head out of  the cabin and saw us  all sitting by the fire pit. He came over with the little griddle and a pack of bacon and a carton of eggs and he said ""I'm starting breakfast"" while setting up the griddle. He made us all breakfast and we enjoyed it even though the bacon was a bit burnt, Tommy gave his to me cause he didn't like it too crispy. The day was pretty similar to yesterday, just a lazy day at the lake. Shortly after lunch Jen wanted to see town since when we cam through it was dark out so we got a shopping list from the other two camps and some money. We  made the almost two hour drive into town to pick up food and see what all was in town, I already knew, even in a city of 10 thousand, there wasn't much that was worth stopping at. We went to the chain store that we have back home and it was laid out almost identical so it was easy to get what we needed and didn't have to wander for too long for what we needed. As we checked out I saw uncle Frank at the next register over and we chatted while checking out then on our way out to the parking lot, He was only  a couple spots from us. He recommended a we stop by the little oval track across town for the race if we were looking to spend an afternoon doing something other than sitting at the lake. Jen said that sounds like it could be interesting and Tommy heard racetrack and was in, regardless of what was actually racing. We went over to the track and spent a couple hours watching all the different classes race, Tommy had a blast, Jen seemed to be enjoying herself and me, being a crew chief for a dirt racer back home was in my element. After the races and bringing Tommy by the pits to see the cars up close, we starter on the drive back to camp.  We got back about a half hour before dark and everyone was sitting around the fire. We unloaded the stuff we bought and told them we had gone to the races and they were like ""oh yea that was today huh"" we got Tommy put to bed and went back out to the fire and there was a chill to the air that kept us close to the fire. I went to grab a blanket, the ring in the box and start a fire in the woodstove. I got back as the fire was shrinking so I threw a couple logs on it and then my uncle said he was gonna turn in for the night and when I looked up to say good night, I noticed the northern lights, getting brighter behind him. I knew it was almost time. I sat down next to Jen and we watched the flames flicker for 15 or so minutes then they started to die down and as Jen went to get up to head in, I took her hand and stood up and told her to look up. She smiled and looked up and her jaw fell open in awe. The entire sky was full of the dancing northern lights. As she stood there , the reflection of them in her eyes, just looking all around I knew it was now or never. As she was back to me, I pulled out the ring box, got down on one knee and opened the box.  ""Jennifer"" she turned and looked down and met my eyes ""Will you marry me"" she then noticed the ring and the lights reflecting across the amethyst, matching what I had seen in her eyes, ""YES, YES I WILL"" she almost yelled. As I stood up to slide the ring onto her finger I noticed everyone that had gone in from the fire standing just off in the shadows. They were all clapping and congratulating us as we stood there in an embrace that couldn't be broken. She looked at the ring on her finger, still seeing the lights of blue and green dancing in the gemstone. ""I got pictures of the moment and the ring glinting in the dark"" my aunt and uncle said. This moment will live on forever. Everyone went back to bed after more congratulations and we sat in the cabin starring into each others eyes. ""With this ring, I want you to know, I mean forever, nothing will ever change that"" I said to Jen. She still had that look of awe and excitement across her face ""I would hope for nothing less"" she said admiring it in the dim light from the woodstove. She climbed into my lap facing me and asked how I  knew the lights were gonna be so vivid tonight and I told her I had  been studying local photographers work to see when they would be most visible during the times that the camp was open.

 Now the rest of the night, for reasons will not be put into the story(If there is interest, I can type it up and DM it), We'll say there was a lot of cuddles and snuggling in the truck as to not wake Tommy         

Day 4: August 31st.  I wake up to Jen in my arms, still feeling like last night was a wild fantasy. I slide my hand down to hers and feel the ring on her finger and I just smile and pull her closer.  I climb out of bed after holding her for another half hour and get dressed and start my coffee. I sit in an old rocking chair next to the woodstove and put in another log to warm up the cabin. I open the door and step outside  as the first light comes over the trees and shine across what looks like a light frost that vanishes as soon as the light hits it. I quickly close the door behind me and head for the outhouse, realizing this is gonna be a cold and miserable few minutes. After I finish in there, I head back for the cabin and notice the warmth has sunk into everything as I walk in and sit back in the rocking chair, looking at Jen while she sleeps. In all honesty, There isn't a more beautiful sight in the world at this point than watching her sleep. I wonder if she's dreaming as I sit back and take another sip of my coffee. Oh to be a fly on the wall in her dream, I can only imagine how perfect everything is inside her head. After a couple minutes, she says ""Take a picture, it'll last longer"" without even opening her eyes. I smile, walk over to her and kiss her on the forehead and she gets this ear to ear smile that just melts my heart on the spot. I sit on the bed and ask how she slept to which she replies ""I don't think I've slept that good in years."" She then pulls her hand out from under the covers and just stares at the ring, watching the light flicker as she moves her hand back and forth, ""it's like you went into my head and found the exact ring I've always wanted and you got the size perfect"" she says lightly, still smiling. She get's out of bed and makes her coffee then sits back next to me and lays her head on my shoulder. We start discussing the plan for the day: Pack everything up this morning and hangout at the camp till around noon then head back to uncle Franks house and spend some time there relaxing before we call it a night early for the long drive home the following day. Once we have the plan figured out, we start cleaning up inside the cabin and getting some stuff loaded in the truck as Tommy wakes up. We chat with Charles and Kayla while loading the truck and Charles mentions making breakfast again and wanders off to get everything to make it. Meanwhile, Kayla is just in awe of the ring, finally seeing it in the daylight. We all have a quiet breakfast and more light talk about the trip home and such and when they'll be able to post the pictures they took from this week, cause you know how older folks are, they wanna tell everyone about the moment they saw ""young love blossom and a new chapter start"". We let the truck warm up and get Tommy buckled into his seat and say our goodbyes and see you laters to family and friends alike. We drive back to Franks house and spend the afternoon relaxing and chatting about when we set dates for the wedding how we'll send them invites and make sure we keep them posted on the details of everything. We settle in and start watching a couple movies to wind down. After the first movie Tommy is asleep so Jen has me carry him to the bed he's staying in and we tuck him in then return to the living room for the second movie. About halfway through, Jen and myself are dosing off so we say our goodnights and goodbyes since we plan on leaving at first light the following morning. I open the blind before climbing into bed with her and we both look out the window and see the Aroura still dancing in the darkness ""they'll dance as long as our love lasts in this lifetime"" I say to Jen as I lean to kiss her on the cheek ""you're so sappy and I absolutely love it"" she replies, smiling at me and slides her hand up to our faces and lets the amethyst catch the lights as it did the night before ""I think they like it"" she says, watching the light dance in the ring. ""I'm sure they do"" I reply, watching the lights dancing in her eyes and the ring ""I'm sure they do."" The lights continue waltzing across the sky as we both fall asleep, holding each other close.        

Day 5: September 1st. We both woke up when my alarm went off at 6am. I silenced my alarm and we looked into each others eyes and we both kinda half smiled and said we might as well get this show on the road. I got up and got dressed to go start our morning coffees and she got our stuff packed up in the bedroom. I made her coffee while she got Tommy up and ready to go and I was drinking mine. As we talked a little, I remote started the truck to let it warm up and melt the frost off of it. After we both finished our cups, we all made one last effort to use the restroom before we hit the road for the long drive home. As we walked out the door, I felt a hand on my shoulder and I jumped a little ,turned and saw uncle Frank standing there. He wrapped me in a hug and said ""congratulations again, she seems like a wonderful young lady and I haven't seen you this happy in many years"" I had a small tear in my eye as I hugged him and said ""Thank you Frank, for everything this week, it wouldn't have been as special anywhere else"" With that I said goodbye and headed for the truck. We headed south back towards home with the memories of a wonderful week still fresh in our minds. Again, the drive was mostly uneventful. A few rest stops along the way and a stop at the L.L.Bean flagship store because why not, it was just a slight detour. As we turned back onto  our road in the evening, I had this sense of ""this is the first day of the rest of my life and I couldn't be any happier"" When we pulled into the driveway I had a slight smile tugging at my lips and Jen, even though she was asleep, looked happier than she had before this trip. I parked in the driveway and started unloading everything back into the house while Jen and Tommy were sleeping. Once everything was unloaded, I carried Tommy up to his bed and tucked him with his stuffed moose that we got for him on our detour. I went back down to the truck and opened the door so I could try and carry Jen into the house (I'm a sucker for trying things that are old school romantic) as I go to put my arms around her she opens one eye and says ""I don't think so, I hate being carried"" and she slowly climbed out of the truck as I lightly chuckled ""I was gonna try"" I said and her smile said everything on her mind at once. I walked her into the house and we both sat on the couch and she laid across my lap and said ""five more minutes"" as she fell asleep again. I sat there, heart full of joy and thought to myself, yea five minutes should be fine and closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep. 

Thanks to anyone who made it to the end and I gotta ask, does anyone have any idea as to why I keep having this dream over and over?",1,1758243823.0,DreamInterpretation,0,1.0,False

I recently picked up *Camino Island* by John Grisham, and I'm really keen to share my thoughts with you all. If you're looking for a delightful escape into a world of books and mystery, you might want to consider checking out [Camino Island – John Grisham (Camino Island Series Book 1)](https://pdfhive.com/camino-island-john-grisham-camino-island-series-book-1/).

This particular Grisham novel steps a little away from his usual courtroom dramas, offering a refreshing change of pace. The story kicks off with a daring, high-stakes heist of priceless F. Scott Fitzgerald manuscripts from a secure vault. The insurance company, desperate to recover these treasures, hires Mercer Mann, a struggling young writer. Her mission? To go undercover on Camino Island, a charming, laid-back Florida haven that's home to a vibrant community of rare book dealers and enthusiasts. Her target is the charismatic and eccentric bookseller, Bruce Cable, whom they suspect might know more about the stolen goods than he lets on. It's a blend of literary intrigue, mystery, and the allure of island life.

### What Really Stood Out to Me

**The Setting:** Camino Island itself felt like a character. Grisham paints a vivid picture of this sunny, relaxed place, full of quirky residents and the intoxicating scent of old books. It made me want to pack my bags and visit a charming, independent bookstore on a sun-drenched island.

**The World of Rare Books:** I absolutely loved getting a peek into the fascinating, sometimes cutthroat, world of rare book collecting and dealing. It's clear Grisham did his homework, and the details about first editions, authentication, and the sheer passion involved were genuinely captivating. It made the stakes of the heist feel very real for anyone who cherishes books.

**Mercer Mann:** Our protagonist, Mercer, was very relatable. As a writer, she felt authentic in her struggles, her observations, and her determination. She's smart and observant, navigating a world of secrets and charm, and it's easy to root for her as she tries to uncover the truth while maintaining her cover.

**Grisham's Writing:** While it’s a departure, Grisham's signature clear, engaging, and propulsive writing style shines through. He keeps the story moving at a good pace without bogging it down, making it an easy and enjoyable read. It’s less about legal jargon and more about character dynamics and unfolding secrets.

### A Few Nuances to Consider

Now, if you're coming into this expecting a classic, intense Grisham courtroom thriller with lawyers battling it out, you might find *Camino Island* a bit different. The stakes here feel more personal and literary rather than life-and-death legal battles. It's a gentler mystery, more of a slow burn, which some avid thriller fans might find less adrenaline-fueled than his other works. Some secondary characters, while charming, don't get a huge amount of depth, but that doesn't detract from the overall experience.

***

### So, Would I Recommend It? Absolutely!

If you enjoy a good mystery that isn't overly dark or violent, if you love books about books, or if you're just looking for a delightful story that transports you to a sunny locale, then yes, I heartily recommend *Camino Island*. It's perfect for a relaxed weekend read or taking on your next vacation. It’s a great pick for casual readers and fans of light thrillers or general fiction.

1nkpqq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1nkpqq6/am_i_a_bad_mom/,Am I a bad mom.,"Single mom for 3 years. Left my ex of 9 years. We've had my son for 3 years, and I left because of the mental and verbal abuse.   
  
My circumstances are different compared to his. 

I'm a single mom. I WFH and only go to the office when I need to. I've made sure that I ended up with a company that could cater to my mom schedule. 

I have neither a maid nor a yaya (house help), so I do everything on my own. From picking him up from his dad, bringing him, and picking him up from school. I cook his food, I clean the house, the dishes, and the mess he makes from playing with his toys.   
  
**My day-to-day looks like this:**  
**5 AM  to 6 AM:** Have coffee, make his breakfast  
**6 AM to 7 AM:** Getting him ready for school, getting him to dress up, packing his food, and trying to get ready myself.   
**7:20 AM to 8 AM:**, We leave for his school, which is 20-30 minutes away   
**8 AM - 2:30 PM:** I go to a local cafe and I stay there to catch up on work and stay there the whole day until he comes out of school, 130pm ot 230pm  
**230 PM to 330 PM:** (if im lucky) sometimes I get home at 4 pm   
**4:00 PM:** We get home, and I clean up after the dog. Catch up on work again.  But in between, my son asks for food, so I prepare it.   
**5 PM to 6 PM: I** make dinner for him   
  
And from 6 PM, everything is just kind of up in the air. I want to take my kid out to play somewhere, but then I still have work to finish, clean up the kitchen, because whatever i used in the morning, i leave it out to wash at the end of the day. vacuum and mop since I have a dog, and clean up the toys he used. and then I try to finish work with the amount of time I have. 

And im usually battling with the energy I have left. I wake up at 4 am. By the time I finish, everything is usually at 10 pm, and if I decide to go out and play with my son, all those chores are left out for me to come back to, and I end up finishing the day at 12midnight. 

And sometimes, I need to choose carefully what activity I can do with him cause he needs to be in bed by 9 PM, and anything too tiring will make him tired in school the next day.  
  
I'm saying this cause I co-parent with his dad. And lately, my son hasn't wanted to be with me.  According to his dad, he has expressed that he doesn't want to go to my house cause we share schedules.   
  
We have absolutely different circumstances. His dad has a maid, someone to do all the housework work while he has all the time to play with him without having to worry about the cleaning. 

And the father is abusive. Lately, I've been made to feel like I'm not really a good enough mom, and he does this every week. He has something to say every week. And it's getting to my subconscious, and it's making me depressed. 

My son is very disrespectful towards me sometimes, and I wonder if it's cause he's picking it up from his dad.   
  
Just last week the dad was screaming at me when I picked up my son from his place for my time with him. And he was screaming at me, in public, with my son in the back. And I just want it to stop.
