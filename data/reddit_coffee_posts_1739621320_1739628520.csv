I am taking the family to the south of France for a weeks holiday in may.  I‚Äôll be treating it as a warm weather training camp for Ironman 70.3 I have in July.

1iq1txt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iq1txt,Orange Staining on My Hands,"I F22 have been waking up with orange staining on my hands and sometimes my feet for about 1 year. I want to believe this is creatine staining. For context, I am a 2 year severe sepsis survivor that had an unknown bacterial infection in my kidneys and my stomach caused by a uti (very long story on how the it even went from a uti to severe sepsis, but I'm just lucky to be alive). I went to my MD about this a few months ago and she said she had no idea what the staining was. But as I did more looking I think it might be creatine staining. Even after the 2 years I can't go a day without drinking constant water and I have to watch my diet or my stomach becomes extremely upset. I also don't drink alcohol because if I do it results in some pain and it's just not worth it. I use THC products, but only vaporizers so I wouldn't think I would be getting any sticky staining from that. When I went to see my MD I got a blood test and creatine levels came back normal. I guess what I'm wondering is if this something that wouldn't show any difference in creatine levels depending on the day. I'm concerned that there may be an underlying issue of some sort since I do get some pain if I drink a soda can (I only consume diet) or a coffee.

Last night I went to a party and I forgot to bring my water with me, but sometimes this isn't a problem so I had diet coke and some pizza. I was there for 5 hours without water and I noticed the staining was beginning to appear while I was there. Attached are photos from this morning. Is this something I should be concerned about or could this just be another one of my side effects? Is this creatine staining? Any answers appreciated.

I am a university student in an eastern european country. Recently my teacher told me that there is this opportunity to work in a local cafeteria as a manager. I was like okay let‚Äôs try it and went for an interview. Turns out the position is already filled, but the owner told me that he has something in mind for me, and that would be the marketing.

Okay so here are some facts about the cafeteria:
- It employs disabled people, who are able to work in a cafeteria. Right now they have only autistic employees.
- The owner said that they sell like 7-8 coffees a good day, which is clearly not enough. He said they need at least 50 coffees a day.
- It is funded by a protestant organization


What are some strong parts of the cafeteria:
- it is situated right next to my university and a high school
- it is close to the city center
- the prices are pretty low compared to other cafeterias.

Some weak parts:
- there is an older, more famous cafeteria nearby
- there is a pub nearby where most students go.

Some of my ideas that could get the cafeteria more costumers:
- social media - they barely post anything on facebook, instagram or tiktok, so the people of my city doesn‚Äôt even know that it exists.
- colaboration with the university - giving the students of my university some promotions, and sponsoring the events with some coupons to let them know they are there and the prices are less than anywhere else.


Does anybody has a business like this? If I do the marketing plan right could I get the cafeteria more costumers? Does anybody has any more idea how to grow this business with different methods that I didn‚Äôt mention? 
I really want to help this business and I want to make some money for myself but if the shop doesn‚Äôt get more clients it will eventually be closed.

I hope the 1% understand you can't take nonexistent money from people. It comes from people not spending for their services and other stuff.","My electric bill jumped from 90 at most to 550 for the same amount of electricity. Gas went up too. So, that means instead of buying Disney+, Amazon Prime, and other services, I have to take their money they were getting from me and give it to Eversource only. I encourage everyone to do this and let the %1 realize they're fighting themselves. Pit them against each other.

Instead of them constantly pitting us against each other. We need to remind them that they are fighting each other for this money and their greed is literally screwing them over. 

Sadly, the only way out of this is to have the stock market crash. That's the only time the people at the top will do anything to fix anything. As long as they keep getting their money, they'll think they're just fine and untouchable. If you're not the %1, dump whatever stocks you have because sadly a crash is coming. We can't sustain this economy.

There are many ways to cheaply get a hold of items to be delivered. Many ways to view entertainment. Libraries are great sources for music and videos and even video games now and not just books. You can even rent audio books. Support your libraries so these resources can become bigger. 

I hate to say it but it's time to live even more frugal. They can't get our money unless we spend it on them. Right now, the only necessities are bills, food, and clothes (and screw name brand, who cares we are not in high school). Bills should only be home, electric, gas, oil if needed, water, trash if needed, phone, and internet. Find services that bundle those two together like T-Mobile if you are able so you only support one place. 

Find your nearest Costco and shop there only if you able to afford that membership or Stop and Shop. The less you spread your money around, the less people at the top will get it. I'm not saying don't get your coffee but coffee prices are going to go up just like electric did. This is what happens when you upset the people who gives us what we need and tax them more.

So if we are to be a proper nation we‚Äôll need to establish a capitol, National bird, national animal, flower, etc. Each state can contribute one or many of their existing state icons, and we can make some new ones too.

National Bird: Blue Jay. The Blue Jay isn‚Äôt one of our state birds, but a beautiful and badass bird nonetheless. Highly intelligent, it can remember where it planted acorns up to a mile away. 

National Animal: Sperm whale. The state mammal of CT. Huge, imposing, and plentiful. Represents the badassery of our ancestors, the whalers. 

National Motto: ‚ÄúLive free or Die‚Äù No explanation needed.

National Flower: Mayflower. The state flower of Massachusetts, and a reminder that out history is far older than the United States. 

National Insect: The honeybee. The state insect  of Maine. Represents our hard work and sustainability. 

National Song: Yankee Doodle. The state song of Connecticut, but overall good for everyone who wants to be free of oppression. 

National Tree: Sugar Maple, the state tree of Vermont. Maple syrup tasty. It pains me not to have the White Oak, but CT can‚Äôt have everything. 

Capitol: New Haven. Yeah I said it. It‚Äôs the biggest city in New England that isn‚Äôt complete ass to drive through.

Am I having unreasonable expectations?,"I (late 20s) didn‚Äôt grow up with a model of what healthy friendships or social expectations should look like. My parents were very isolated and actively prevented me from forming friendships, which led to severe social anxiety and low self-confidence. I‚Äôve worked hard to overcome this through therapy, but I still struggle with knowing what‚Äôs reasonable to expect from friends.

I have a close friend who has been leaving me feeling uncomfortable, and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being too sensitive or if my feelings are valid.

For context, my husband and I have hosted this friend and her partner multiple times. Every time, I cooked homemade meals, made desserts, and we tried to be thoughtful hosts‚Äîchecking if they needed drinks, snacks, etc. We wanted them to feel comfortable and welcome.

After we had them over a few times, they invited us for ""dinner"" at their place. When we arrived, my friend said she didn‚Äôt have time to cook and wanted to go out instead. No problem‚Äîbut when the bill came, they paid for themselves, and we had to cover our own meals. Back at their place, they gave us a glass of water and never checked in if we needed anything the rest of the evening.

Fast forward to yesterday. My friend invited us over again for ""dinner and a movie night."" We brought alcohol and soft drinks to contribute. When we got there, they served us a ¬£2 frozen supermarket pizza‚Äînothing else. At one point, I asked if I could have a coffee, and when my friend gave me one, her partner jokingly said, ""Oh, you gave them the good stuff?"" (referring to normal coffee instead of instant).

They earn significantly more than us and know we‚Äôre struggling financially right now. I don‚Äôt expect expensive meals or over-the-top hosting, but the lack of effort makes me feel undervalued in this friendship. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overreacting or if this is just a case of different hosting styles.",3,1739626667.0,CPTSD_NSCommunity,0,1.0,False
1iq1hb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1iq1hb7/manager_seeking_advice_on_underperforming/,Manager Seeking Advice on Underperforming Employee with Attendance and Performance Issues,"Hi all,

I joined my current role as a manager four weeks ago and inherited a team member who has several performance and attendance concerns. They are consistently late for work and meetings, often stopping to assist others on the way to meetings and not telling people they have somewhere else to be, example a meeting with one of the SLT team they where 7 mins late, the meeting started, and said they where outside the door waiting while i said no you where not, i could see you on the phone to someone and so could the SLT team and you did not say sorry for being late, but not making up the lost time. Over the past eight months, they have missed six days of work, and their performance does not align with the expectations for their salary after nine months in the role.

I have raised these concerns with HR and my own manager, expressing that I don't believe they are meeting expectations. They are quite inexperienced, requiring extensive training, I dont think they have the background they say they have as I picked up on this after 2 weeks, and I‚Äôve also noted that they have some personal challenges, including mental health struggles they have PTSD and a strong dependency on their partner for life decisions and work decisions.

For two of the nine months, they had no direct manager and did not have a good working relationship with their previous one. Given the ongoing issues, I had a discussion with HR and my manager about their timekeeping and performance. We decided to place them on a performance improvement plan (PIP) to assess whether they can improve. This discussion took place after they had gone home sick, but based on context, my manager and I suspect it was stress-related rather than an actual illness‚Äîpotentially triggered by personal circumstances.

This brings me to our one-on-one meeting yesterday. They arrived 10 minutes late (despite it being the first meeting of the day) and were also 30 minutes late for work again. I addressed the timekeeping issue directly, stating that if they are paid for eight hours, they need to work eight hours. I emphasized that while I am flexible with work hours, we need an agreed schedule rather than unpredictable arrivals. I also made it clear that another unexcused absence would escalate to a formal HR hearing, which I want to avoid.

At this point, they had a full emotional breakdown‚Äîcrying, shaking, and expressing anger toward me, the company, my manager, and HR. Given the intensity of the situation, I immediately called my manager, went to HR, and brought in a witness along with a support person for them. The breakdown continued, with them claiming they were never properly trained.

When they asked about their performance, I was honest and explained that significant improvement is needed. Over the past four weeks, I‚Äôve had to step in repeatedly when new hires started because nothing was prepared‚Äîlaptops, phones, desks, accounts, etc. Additionally, I have to micromanage their tasks daily, as they frequently walk away from issues without informing me. This results in me having to diagnose and fix problems myself instead of them escalating them appropriately. I reassured them that improvement is possible, but they need to take initiative and ask for help when needed.

Their response was that they ""haven't been told what they are supposed to do."" I pointed out that they have been given clear direction‚Äîthis is an IT support role, ensuring things work for end users. My role, on the other hand, is to handle the business side, coordinate with management, plan IT projects, and provide leadership and we have a full SOD of what my role is and what your role is. It was also shared that unexpected goals and deliverables where put on them by people, I asked could you tell me who and if you have email or chat proof send it to me and I will speak to these managers and people.

At the end of the conversation, they requested a five-minute break for a smoke. HR and I looked at each other and acknowledged that we have a serious problem. I have since decided that I will no longer have one-on-one meetings with them without a third party present. They believe they are performing well, but after nine months, their inexperience is still a major concern.

At the end of the meeting I asked them to take 30 mins and go to the local coffee shop for a walk and coffee with the support person to clear there head and said to them when I am stressed I go into a room and have a scream or go for a walk for 5 mins and have a coffee. And I can help you to do this if you ever feel like you need it. However this was refused and they called there partner over going for a walk. When they came back they would not speak to me and would only deal with me via emails.

So, what are your thoughts? How should I proceed from here as I have been a manager for 8 years out of my 12 plus years of working and I have never seen a mental breakdown in front of me from feedback over timekeeping and performance ?

My thoughts is that I cut my loss and start with someone fresh in the role?,

I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm looking for here, but my heart & head are both hurting and I need some advice (or maybe just a space to vent). For this to make sense, we‚Äôll call my ex Kirk and his ex Sadie. 

So, like the title says, I met a Kirk (M27) last spring and everything just felt *right*. We clicked on so many levels, he told his friends/family about me (I even met some of them!), and we ended up dating for about 3 months. 

During this time, we talked a lot about our lives, childhoods, and dating histories. This is when he told be about his ex Sadie (F26) whom he met in college, and who would have nothing to do with him at first. He said he was in the sidelines ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù for her for years, because she kept leading him on ‚Äì every time he would try to move on with someone new, she would get jealous and say/do something that would make him think they were actually going to date, only for her to ‚Äúnot be ready‚Äù or whatever. Anyways, they ended up dating for a while (a year or two) which consisted of them always arguing and (his words) ‚Äúbeing on a constant rollercoaster of extreme up‚Äôs and extreme down‚Äôs.‚Äù They broke up for a while, which is when Sadie slept with one of Kirk‚Äôs best friends (we‚Äôll call him Roman) ‚Äì Roman told another member of their friend group about it, which is how it got back to Kirk. Kirk was devastated (obviously) but ended up forgiving both Sadie & Roman bc they claimed it was ‚Äúonly physical‚Äù (no emotions there). He gave Sadie a second chance when she asked, only for them to breakup again a few months later (this time, he broke up with her); during the breakup, however, she called him ‚Äúnot emotionally and intellectually challenging‚Äù enough for her, which he said hurt him like nothing else ever has. 

Fast forward to us dating, and everything is going well! However, one night at dinner, I noticed he was acting kind of strange. I asked what was wrong, and he told me that Sadie had requested to follow him on Instagram again (since they had unfollowed each other after the most recent breakup), and he said ‚ÄúI guess she can just sense when I‚Äôm finally happy with someone else.‚Äù A few weeks later, I noticed they were following each other again, but I tried my best not to think anything of it as he told/promised one of their mutual friends (with me there) that he ‚Äúnever wanted to open up that toxic & crazy can of worms‚Äù with Sadie ever again. 

After 3 months of dating, he realized he just ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt ready for a serious relationship‚Äù because there was still things he needed to heal and ‚Äúshit to sort out‚Äù on his end. He said he didn‚Äôt want to lose me and wanted to keep me in his life, but that he understood if it would be too painful in this weird limbo state. I said it would, in fact, be too painful for me and we went no contact - with him promising that, as soon as he‚Äôs worked through his stuff, he would reach out to me and we would give this thing another serious shot. We kissed, and that was the last time I heard from him.

Since then, I have tried dating other people, but nothing has really panned out. Although I was doing my best to live my life and not wait around for him, I‚Äôd be lying if I said that there wasn‚Äôt a tiny sliver of hope deeply embedded into my heart that we *might* just get that second chance together, as he promised before we took our break. 

Yesterday, Valentine‚Äôs Day, I had a weird inkling to check Sadie‚Äôs Instagram page - which is where I saw it: a picture of him holding coffee with flowers, chocolates, candles, balloons, candy, love notes, etc. all sprawled out on his apartment table with the caption ‚ÄúI love you so much!!!üíì‚Äù

To say my stomach dropped would be an understatement, and all hope that we would get back together was demolished in a split second. I‚Äôm not completely surprised, to be honest, but I really thought he cared about me & our future enough that he would follow through on the promises he made during our ‚Äúbreak‚Äù conversation. Instead, it seems as if he broke all of them and couldn‚Äôt care less. 

I‚Äôm just having a hard time comprehending all of this. I know I should just move on to better things, but I can‚Äôt help but think: why wasn‚Äôt I enough for him? Why would he choose someone so toxic and mentally abusive when we had such a healthy relationship filled with genuine respect and happiness and love? And are his friends and family just allowing this cycle to continue without trying to intervene or give advice in some way? Is this finally the time things will workout between them? Have they both grown/healed enough that they‚Äôll finally get married? Did he even mean the things he told me and the promises we made? 

My brain is spiraling with questions and the Kirk I knew has completely vanished from my mind and, honestly, I really miss him. If you‚Äôve read all of this, I appreciate you and any words of wisdom that you may be able to provide! Just a girl in need of a good ole rant and some advice that‚Äôll help me put things into perspective (at least until my scheduled therapy session next weekend, lol). Thanks - love y‚Äôall!‚ù§Ô∏è

1. Dinner out twice at restaurants with a view and excellent seafood (does not have to be expensive or fancy - just looking for great quality and taste in a fun setting that will feel like vacation). 

2. Beach/tiki bar type of spot to do some day-drinkin'/happy hour one day.

3. Other than on the beach which we plan to walk a lot - reco's for a park or nature area with a great walk/hike to experience nature beyond the beach? 

4. Neighborhoods to check out - looking for older houses with character like what I see on zillow for Avondale area, walkable neighborhood (walk to coffee, dining, shopping, a bit of community).

1iq15fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/InterestingToRead/comments/1iq15fu/my_deep_thoughts_about_life/,My Deep Thoughts about life,"I‚Äôm just a guy who likes to think. A lot. Not in a way that makes me any wiser or smarter than anyone else---just in a way that makes me, well, me. My mind constantly wanders and drifts toward the big questions that have puzzled humanity since the dawn of consciousness: What is the nature of reality? What does it mean to be truly alive? What is this mysterious thing we call flow, and how do we find it in our daily lives? I don‚Äôt claim to have the answers, but I find deep joy in exploring these eternal mysteries.

I‚Äôve found that the more I sit with these thoughts, the more I realize how little control we actually have over the grand tapestry of existence---and how incredibly freeing that realization can be. Life is perpetual movement, constant change, endless transformation. It‚Äôs like a river that keeps flowing, whether we choose to fight against its current or learn to swim harmoniously with it.

So, this is me, thinking out loud, letting the thoughts take shape as they naturally emerge from the depths of consciousness. I‚Äôm not seeking grand conclusions or absolute certainty---just embracing curiosity, cultivating presence, and maintaining a willingness to see where the mysterious flow of existence leads.

Universe‚Ä¶ one turning, one change. That‚Äôs what it means, doesn‚Äôt it? This has been occupying my thoughts lately with increasing frequency. The way everything is just‚Ä¶ flowing. Moving. Transforming. Even as I sit here trying to pin down these thoughts, countless cells in my body are dying and being reborn in an endless dance of renewal. Nothing in this vast cosmos stays still for even a moment.

I‚Äôve been deeply immersing myself in this subject lately ‚Äì fascinated by how the word ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù comes from Latin, uni- meaning ‚Äúone‚Äù and versus meaning ‚Äúturned‚Äù or ‚Äúchanged.‚Äù One single turning. One eternal moment of transformation. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ everything we perceive is just this one continuous change, and we‚Äôre all inseparable parts of this grand cosmic dance.

The Earth spinning at what, 67,000 miles per hour through the vastness of space? And here I am sometimes feeling so static, so trapped in my thoughts and behavioral patterns. But I‚Äôm not stuck at all, am I? I‚Äôm literally hurtling through the cosmos on this celestial rock, with blood rushing through my veins, lungs expanding and contracting in perfect rhythm without any effort on my part.

Why do we humans fight so desperately against this fundamental nature of reality though? The inevitability of change, I mean. We grip onto things, relationships, and ideas as if they were solid, permanent fixtures in our lives. But they‚Äôre not. Nothing truly is. Even this precise moment, right now, as I‚Äôm carefully crafting these thoughts ‚Äì it‚Äôs already slipped into the past. New moment. New me. New everything. The ancient Taoists had profound insight into this truth, I think. That whole concept of wu wei ‚Äì effortless action through non-action. Not forcing, not controlling, just‚Ä¶ flowing naturally. Being authentic. Like water finding its elegant path around any obstacle it encounters.

I‚Äôve been consciously trying to practice this perspective lately in my daily life. Just‚Ä¶ observing with full attention. Watching how everything moves in its own perfect rhythm. The wind dancing through the trees. The clouds constantly shifting and reforming overhead. The way my emotions rise and fall like waves on an infinite ocean. It‚Äôs all part of this massive, endless cosmic dance, isn‚Äôt it? And I‚Äôm not outside of it, not some detached observer. I AM it.

That realization is simultaneously terrifying and breathtakingly beautiful. I am the change itself. Not separate from it. Not controlling it. Just‚Ä¶ being it in each moment. My breath serves as a constant reminder of this truth. Each breath uniquely different from the last. Never exactly the same twice. A persistent reminder that change isn‚Äôt something that happens TO us ‚Äì it‚Äôs what we ARE at our core.
You know what‚Äôs been particularly helpful in understanding this? These simple mindfulness practices I‚Äôve been experimenting with lately. Like in the morning, instead of rigidly forcing myself to stick to some predetermined routine, I try to sensitively feel what feels right in each moment. What the natural flow is calling for. It‚Äôs often subtle, not some dramatic shift in behavior, but rather small mindful adjustments. Following the natural rhythm of life instead of constantly fighting against it.

The mental aspects are definitely the most challenging though. These persistent thoughts that spin and spiral endlessly, creating their own little universe of worry and endless what if scenarios. But even they‚Äôre not solid or permanent. They come and go like weather patterns across the sky of consciousness. Dark clouds, sunny skies, storms, peaceful calm‚Ä¶ all passing through the same vast space of pure awareness. I‚Äôm gradually learning to watch them without getting hopelessly caught up in their drama.

Sometimes I find myself questioning whether I‚Äôm going a bit crazy thinking about all this metaphysical stuff. Like, who really spends their time contemplating the profound nature of change and the vast mysteries of the universe? But then again, maybe that‚Äôs exactly what we as conscious beings should be thinking about. Maybe all our seemingly important daily dramas and concerns are just‚Ä¶ tiny ripples on the surface of something infinitely deeper and more meaningful than we typically realize.

I‚Äôve been diving deeper into this fascinating world of mindfulness and present-moment awareness too. It‚Äôs truly remarkable how much of life‚Äôs rich tapestry we miss when we‚Äôre caught up in our endless stream of thoughts about the past or anxieties about the future. Like this one particularly memorable day, I was walking to the local store -- something I‚Äôve done countless times before without much thought ‚Äì but this time I made a conscious effort to be fully present in the experience. The way the golden sunlight filtered through the vibrant leaves, creating these intricate dancing shadows on the concrete sidewalk below. The melodious symphony of birds I usually completely tune out in my mental busyness. Even the subtle sensation of my feet making contact with the ground with each mindful step. It was as if I was seeing the familiar world through entirely new eyes. 

Then there‚Äôs this profound concept of non-attachment that I‚Äôve been wrestling with lately. Not in some cold, emotionally disconnected way that some might misinterpret it as, but in this deeply loving and accepting way of being. I can care intensely and passionately about things and people while also maintaining a understanding that everything in this universe is temporary, always in a state of flux and transformation. This perspective has actually enhanced my appreciation for life‚Äôs precious moments. When you truly internalize that nothing is permanent, you naturally cherish each experience more deeply in the present moment.

I‚Äôve been actively experimenting with this intriguing idea of emotional alchemy as well. Instead of fighting against or trying to suppress negative emotions, seeing them as pure energy that can be consciously transformed through awareness. When anxiety bubbles up about an approaching deadline or an important meeting, instead of getting hopelessly tangled in the mental narrative around it, I try to simply observe it with gentle awareness. Feel it move through my body like a wave of energy. It‚Äôs really just energy in motion when you think about it. E-motion. Pure life force expressing itself through these temporary forms we call feelings.

And speaking of subtle energy ‚Äì I‚Äôve been developing a heightened sensitivity to how it flows through different spaces and situations in my daily life. Like how some environments just feel heavy and stagnant, as if the energy has become trapped and needs clearing, while others feel light, vibrant and alive with possibility. Or how certain individuals seem to have this remarkable ability to shift the energetic frequency of an entire room just by walking into it. We‚Äôre all these complex fields of living energy, constantly influencing and being influenced by everything and everyone around us in this intricate dance of interconnection.

The body knows all this stuff naturally and instinctively. It‚Äôs the analytical mind that so often forgets these basic truths. The body exists in a constant state of flow, always adapting, always responding with intelligence to what each moment presents. It‚Äôs only our thoughts and concepts that create this persistent illusion of solidity, of permanence, of separation from the whole. I‚Äôve been practicing awareness of this in small everyday activities. Like when I‚Äôm walking, consciously feeling how each step naturally flows into the next in perfect harmony. Or when I‚Äôm preparing food, noticing with fascination how ingredients transform and combine to become something entirely new and hopefully delicious.

I‚Äôve been contemplating the nature of resistance a lot lately, examining how much precious life energy we waste fighting against what simply is. Like this one morning ‚Äì I found myself stuck in traffic, and I could feel that all-too-familiar tension rising in my body like a tidal wave. But then, in a moment of clarity, I remembered: this too is simply part of life‚Äôs eternal flow. Instead of resisting this reality, I made a conscious choice to sink deeply into the present moment. Used this unexpected pause to truly listen to the music playing through my speakers, to observe with fascination the intricate play of morning light on the cars ahead, to notice my own breath moving in and out. It‚Äôs truly remarkable how differently the exact same external situation feels when you stop exhausting yourself by fighting against reality.

The really mind-bending aspect of all this is contemplating the mysterious nature of time itself. We typically talk about past, present, and future as if they‚Äôre these fixed, separate, and objective realities. But are they really? Time is often spoken of as if the past, present, and future are distinct and concrete. But in reality, only the present moment truly exists. The past is nothing more than memory‚Äîfragments stored in your mind, recalled only in the now. The future is merely imagination‚Äîpossibilities and projections that exist only as thoughts in this moment. Everything you have ever experienced, everything you ever will, happens only in the now. Time, then, may not be a fixed reality but rather a construct of the mind, a way we try to make sense of the ever-flowing present. Einstein revolutionized our understanding by showing that time itself is relative, right? And when you really sink into this state of flow, this dimension we call time seems to‚Ä¶ shift and bend in fascinating ways. Sometimes an hour can feel like a mere breath, sometimes a single minute feels like an eternity. Perhaps time itself is just another aspect of this grand cosmic dance of perpetual change and transformation.

You know what continues to amaze me? The more fully I embrace this natural flow of life, the more I notice how things just‚Ä¶ work themselves out in often unexpected ways. Not always according to my limited personal preferences or expectations, but they invariably work out in ways that serve growth and evolution. It‚Äôs as if the universe itself possesses its own intelligence, its own organic way of unfolding. When I stubbornly try to force reality into conforming with my limited vision and understanding, I create suffering for myself. But when I trust in this universe‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs when life reveals its magic in surprising ways.

I‚Äôve been actively experimenting with applying this understanding to my relationships as well. It's fascinating to observe how differently these connections feel when you release the need to control everything, when you allow people the freedom to be who they authentically are instead of who you think they should be according to your preferences and projections. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ the more I let go of rigid expectations and demands, the more genuine and vibrant these relationships naturally become.

There‚Äôs something particularly fascinating about the creative process too ‚Äì how inspiration flows with effortless grace when you manage to get your analytical mind out of the way. I was carving a stone one day, and for quite a while, I was stuck in my head about it, trying too hard to make it ‚Äúgood‚Äù according to some imagined standard. But then something magical shifted in my awareness, and suddenly it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúme‚Äù doing the carving anymore in any conventional sense. It was as if the stone itself was gradually revealing its form through my hands. I completely lost track of time in that state of pure flow. Came back to normal awareness hours later with dust covering my hands and this profound sense of having been part of something far greater than my individual self.

Through direct experience, I‚Äôm learning that true surrender isn‚Äôt passive or weak at all as some might think. It‚Äôs actually this moment-by-moment conscious choice to step courageously into the unknown and trust that the universe has a greater wisdom than our limited minds can comprehend. It‚Äôs about releasing our desperate need for control and opening ourselves fully to what is, rather than remaining caught in our ideas about what we think should be. Much easier to talk about than to actually live, though, isn‚Äôt it?

Sometimes, in moments of quiet contemplation, I find myself imagining my existence as an inseparable part of this vast, endless cosmic dance. Countless stars being born and dying in spectacular supernovas, entire galaxies spinning in their celestial ballet, planets tracing their eternal orbits through the void, and here I am ‚Äì a brief but conscious flicker of awareness in this infinite flow of existence. But even in my brevity, I‚Äôm fundamentally connected to the whole. Even in my apparent smallness, I‚Äôm woven into the fabric of all that is. My very atoms were forged in the hearts of ancient stars, and they will one day become part of something entirely new.

The ancient wisdom traditions understood these profound truths at a deep level. That‚Äôs precisely why they chose to call it uni-verse. One turning. One change. One eternal moment of perpetual transformation. In our modern reality we‚Äôre not really discovering anything new ‚Äì we‚Äôre simply realizing what the ancients knew, what our bodies have always known at a cellular level, what the very nature of reality has been ceaselessly trying to communicate to us since the beginning of time.

My understanding of death has been transforming lately too. Instead of seeing it as this final, terrible ending to be feared and avoided, I‚Äôm beginning to recognize it as an integral part of the natural flow of existence. Everything in the natural world moves through these endless cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. The seasons, the cycles of the moon, the rising and setting of the sun ‚Äì why should human consciousness be any different? Perhaps what we typically call death is simply another form of transformation, another turning in this infinite cosmic dance that never truly begins or ends.

There‚Äôs something profoundly liberating about embracing this deeper understanding of reality. I don‚Äôt have to carry the impossible burden of having everything figured out. I don‚Äôt need to know with certainty where all of this is ultimately going. My role isn‚Äôt to somehow direct or control the river of life ‚Äì it‚Äôs to learn to swim with it gracefully, to trust its ancient wisdom, to allow it to carry me exactly where I need to go for my highest evolution.

And the synchronicities ‚Äì they seem to multiply once you start paying attention with awareness. Those remarkable moments of perfect timing, those seemingly random ‚Äúcoincidences‚Äù that feel more like gentle whispers from the universe itself. Like yesterday‚Äôs experience, when exactly the book I needed somehow found its way into my hands at precisely the right moment. These aren‚Äôt mere chance occurrences but rather confirmations of our deeper connection to the whole.

I‚Äôve been practicing this approach where instead of forcefully trying to implement changes in my life according to some mental plan, I attempt to align myself more naturally with the changes that are already wanting to happen through me. It‚Äôs similar to‚Ä¶ you know that experience when you‚Äôre swimming in the ocean, and you can either exhaust yourself fighting against the powerful waves or learn to move in harmony with them? When you resist and fight, you quickly become depleted. But when you learn to move with their natural rhythm, there‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ effortless grace that emerges naturally.


I‚Äôve been consciously applying this understanding to my work as well. Instead of forcing myself to push through periods of natural resistance, I‚Äôm learning to notice and honor the times when I‚Äôm naturally energized and aligned with the flow of creativity and productivity. When I work with these natural rhythms rather than against them, I find that not only does the quality of my work improve dramatically, but the entire experience becomes more enjoyable and fulfilling. Sometimes this means working intensely during periods of natural inspiration, while other times it means allowing myself to rest and recharge when my energy naturally ebbs.

Perhaps this is what all the great spiritual teachers throughout history have been trying to help us understand. That we‚Äôre not actually separate from this vast flow of existence as we so often believe. We‚Äôre not isolated islands standing alone in the middle of a flowing river of life. We ARE the river itself in human form. The flow isn‚Äôt some external force we need to somehow tap into or connect with ‚Äì it‚Äôs what we fundamentally are at our deepest level of being. Our very essence is this flow, this dance, this eternal movement of life expressing itself through temporary forms.

I‚Äôm gradually learning to say yes to all of it, to embrace the totality of human experience. The moments of transcendent joy and the periods of deep pain. The times of effortless ease and the challenges that stretch us beyond our comfort zones. The beautiful blossoming of growth and the necessary decay that makes new life possible. Because it's all one seamless movement, isn‚Äôt it? One vast, beautiful, terrible, magnificent flow of being expressing itself in infinite ways. And I‚Äôm not separate from any of it. I never was. I never could be. This understanding brings both profound responsibility and incredible freedom.

Sometimes the most profound and transformative truths are also the simplest and most obvious once we have eyes to see them. Like this morning, I was simply sitting with my steaming cup of coffee, watching with fascination as the delicate wisps of steam rose and spiraled in the crisp morning air. And suddenly it hit me with the force of revelation ‚Äì that‚Äôs me too. That‚Äôs all of us. Rising, spiraling, dissolving, becoming something new in each moment. Over and over and over again in this eternal dance of transformation. The steam wasn‚Äôt just showing me its nature, but revealing my own nature to me in that moment of clarity.

Maybe that‚Äôs the greatest gift of this deepening understanding ‚Äì this profound sense of belonging to something far greater than ourselves. Of being an integral part of something so vast and incomprehensibly beautiful that my limited human mind can‚Äôt fully grasp or contain it. But the beautiful truth is that I don‚Äôt need to intellectually comprehend it all. I just need to flow with it, trust it, allow it to move through me and as me in each moment. My role is to be a conscious participant in this grand dance of existence.

And so here I sit, allowing these thoughts to flow through my awareness like water moving through a stream bed. Each moment entirely unique and different from the last. Each breath marking a new beginning in this eternal now. Each heartbeat serving as a reminder that I am alive, I am changing, I am the change itself expressing through this particular form. The universe isn‚Äôt something out there, separate from who and what I am. It‚Äôs what I am in my deepest essence. What we all are at our core. One vast, eternal moment of transformation, expressing itself in infinite ways through all forms and phenomena.

One verse. One change. One eternal dance of being. And I am dancing it, whether I remember this truth in each moment or not. We all are, every single one of us. Maybe that‚Äôs enough. Maybe that‚Äôs absolutely everything. Maybe in that simple understanding lies the key to living with both grace and purpose in this magnificent mystery we call life.

We moved a bunch for jobs and such but have finally  purchased a home where we plan to be for a few years. I give this background to say that cleanliness in our home has not always been a top priority, and we both had more pressing things going on so we looked past it. See pic 3 for the dishes, they have not been done in a week and that chore is her responsibility.

Since we made this move and got settled into our home, I‚Äôve emphasized multiple times to my partner how keeping common areas clean and free of clutter is very important to me. And how her doing her share of chores around the house is also important to me, given that I did the bulk of household chores for the last 2 years while she was in grad school. 

Despite communicating this clearly numerous times, she makes no effort to work in it. Last night she said she was going to bed and I asked if she could clean up her mess on the coffee table (first pic) and she said ‚Äúeh, I‚Äôll get it in the morning‚Äù. I get a similar reaction when I mention all her stuff on the dining room table, ‚Äúeh, I‚Äôll get to it when I get to it‚Äù.  Meanwhile she keeps saying how we should get a cleaning service, but I don‚Äôt want to pay for a cleaning service when we don‚Äôt make an insane amount of money and she can‚Äôt even take her dirty tissues to the garbage can. 

I feel disrespected, unheard, and like my opinion doesn‚Äôt matter. I don‚Äôt know how to talk to her about this anymore without getting so pissed off that I say something mean.

We have told her time and time and time again - if the sign is on the door, do not knock for any reason. We‚Äôve said it until we are blue in the face. 

She knocked on and in tonight to ask me about blankets in the cold weather like I‚Äôm not 27 and can‚Äôt find my own blankets. It brought me to tears. I just wanted to be left alone after a rough day - see below. 

I‚Äôm 35 weeks pregnant. There‚Äôs a million reasons that sign could be on the door - I‚Äôm emotionally dysregulated, I‚Äôm naked, I‚Äôm sleeping - whatever. 

She still knocks on. How do I politely yell back through the door I don‚Äôt want to be disturbed and that the sign is on the door? 

*I should add I am VERY anxious because if she can‚Äôt respect this basic boundary, how will she respect my boundaries with the baby?

I never expect anything elaborate, and I definitely don‚Äôt give anything elaborate, but I always think about it in advance. This year I got him a vintage cap with his favorite football team, some snacks, and a card. I gave it to him a little early because he had an internship interview on 02/11 and I thought it might boost his spirits. I also purchased lingerie for valentines night.

I have been hinting to this man for weeks that I really hoped to have a good Valentine‚Äôs Day. Again‚Äî I am not asking for anything elaborate‚Äî he could have made me dinner and I would have been thankful. He waited until Valentine‚Äôs Day morning and went to get me chocolate, card, and a coffee and we had plans to go out to eat. That‚Äôs fine, I can deal with that.

Except dinner time rolls around and he says ‚Äúokay where do you want to go?‚Äù And I know by this point we‚Äôre screwed. I just say ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù and wait for him to get dressed. He spends 45+ mins getting dressed, but then gets upset because he gained some weight and some of his clothes don‚Äôt fit. His mood is obviously ruined. We don‚Äôt go out to eat. He offers to take me to do something else. I ask if he could take me to the thrift store (something I really love to do) he agreed. He was obviously in a bad mood the entire time, I can tell by his demeanor and tone of voice. Eventually I cut the thrift store trip short, took the keys from him, and we went home. He went to bed and didn‚Äôt even say anything to me other than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed‚Äù when I asked what he was doing. 

Tried to have sex in the middle of the night and I turned him down.

I travel to Seoul often for business and usually stay near Seoul Station, so I spend a lot of time in Myeongdong. Since foreign friends always ask me for skincare clinic recommendations, I thought I‚Äôd share my personal experiences with a few foreigner-friendly places I‚Äôve visited. For context, I regularly get lifting and Rejuran treatments, so I‚Äôm pretty familiar with these kinds of clinics. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

Abijou Myeongdong
This place is a staple in Myeongdong. It‚Äôs spacious, has parking, and the staff are generally friendly. They even have a coffee machine for a quick drink, which was fun. But it‚Äôs usually packed, and the busy atmosphere makes it feel a bit rushed. It‚Äôs a solid option for quick and affordable treatments, but don‚Äôt expect a luxury experience.

Daybeau Myeongdong
This one‚Äôs a gem. It‚Äôs fairly new and has a premium concept. A Korean friend suggested it, and I‚Äôm so glad they did. From the moment I walked in, the clean, modern interior and calming vibe stood out. The staff were super attentive and professional‚Äîthey explained everything clearly, and I really felt like I was being taken care of. The minimum spend policy was worth it because the entire experience was relaxing and efficient without feeling crowded. My skin looked amazing after the treatment. This is now my go-to clinic when I‚Äôm in Myeongdong. Highly recommend if you want a premium but not intimidating experience.

Vands Myeongdong
Located on the 11th floor of the same building as Daybeau. It‚Äôs known for affordable treatments, and the staff are kind and efficient. There was a bit of a wait, but the service overall was decent. Great for budget treatments without sacrificing too much on quality.

If you‚Äôre looking for skincare in Myeongdong, Daybeau Myeongdong is the clear winner for me. It‚Äôs perfect if you want to feel pampered while getting great results. Anyone else have Myeongdong recs? Drop them in the comments! üòä",2,1739624675.0,koreatravel,0,1.0,False

I'm M25, and I've developed strong feelings for F24 over the past 4-5 months. We've become closer, but I'm unsure if those feelings are reciprocated.  Constantly seeing reminders of her makes it difficult to think clearly.  I recognize that no one is perfect and that my perspective might be skewed due to my feelings.
Logically, I could move on.  However, she possesses qualities I haven't found in others, and I hesitate to invest this level of emotional energy in someone I felt was less exceptional.  I'm at a crossroads.  Patience and waiting are options, but I'm not seeing any clear indications of romantic interest from her.
She's very kind and allows [without making it weird]  me to do thoughtful things for her (like feeding her food). She even gave me a kiss on the cheek after I made her coffee while rehearsing for a play.  However, she's never the one to initiate conversations or calls.  She once mentioned going to the beach together, but the idea hasn't been revisited. We've talked about catching up, but our schedules always seem to conflict.

Specific Advice Needed:
I'm seeking advice on how to navigate this situation. I'm struggling to determine the best course of action.  I need help understanding whether continuing to pursue this is a healthy approach, or if it would be more beneficial for me to focus my energy elsewhere.  I'm finding it hard to be objective and would greatly appreciate some external viewpoints.  What are some things I should consider as I try to decide what to do?

TLDR:  M25, developed feelings for F24 over 4-5 months.  She's kind, but doesn't initiate contact.  I'm unsure whether to continue pursuing the connection or if it's time to shift my focus. I'm having trouble seeing the situation clearly and would like advice on how to make this decision.

Congratulations to AI, not just for taking over our jobs, but for waltzing into the executive suite and claiming a desk next to the CEO. Enter the Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAIO), a title born out of the whirlwind growth of generative AI technologies. Next time you find yourself questioning the AI buzz, just remember‚Äîit‚Äôs not a fad if it‚Äôs coming for corner offices.

**Generative AI: The Disruptor Extraordinaire**

In the era of generative AI, Steve Ferman of 4 Pillar Coach is championing this new role. With AI‚Äôs power to churn out apps faster than you can say ‚Äúdownload,‚Äù the need for a human (or close enough) who can steer this technological tornado is real. Ferman‚Äôs job? Convince business leaders that AI is less about replacing jobs and more about enhancing decision-making and efficiency.

**Addressing the AI Doubters**

One would think the promise of fewer spreadsheets would jumpstart AI adoption post-haste. Yet, skepticism thrives‚Äîafter all, AI doesn‚Äôt make coffee. Business leaders worry about job loss, complexity, and perhaps tech with too much personality (looking at you, ChatGPT). How do we reassure the skeptics? By turning AI into a tool for better, faster decisions, not a malfunctioning robot that usurps the staff meeting.

**AI Stacking: Sales Meetings Just Got Smarter**

Ferman also reveals a secret weapon: AI Stacking. This technique promises to supercharge sales meetings‚Äîno more endless PowerPoints! With AI Stacking, companies assemble multiple AI technologies into a powerhouse combo, like Avengers but without the spandex. Efficiency never looked this good.

So here we are, standing at the precipice where AI holds sway in both the factory and the boardroom. Will the Chief AI Officer remember the rest of us when the machines fully take over?

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 21 years old of age, and older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to pose a problem, I am really not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying any alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. As much as I feel bad to say this, I'm not comfortable with writing with someone completely new to this hobby. I'm sorry!
7. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine and has half-way functioning train networks, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

The action in series mentioned below is a fairly good representation of how, more or less, do I like action in my stories:

Vinland Saga (on the more conservative end), Fullmetal Alchemist, Castlevania (the animated series),  Inuyasha (on the more whacky end)

While I understand that to many of you it is probably too much, I'm unfortunately only willing to compromise so much when action is concerned. (Such as, I do like comically oversized swords every once in a while, but I don't need those in order to be happy!) So, let me repeat myself: before reaching out to me, please make sure that all that I've just said sounds up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

To elaborate a bit more on romance, as I feel it's important: my approach to romance is that I love to have it, and I love to write it, *but* that it should be, at the end of the day, just a sub-plot. Not that it cannot feature into the main plot at all. That'd be silly! What I mean is that should the romance element be excised from the story, we'd still end up with a coherent, intact storyline. I also generally speaking prefer a more slow-burn sort of approach, where it takes quite some time before the characters enter any sort of relationship, *especially* when it's our lead characters. It's not a 'do or die' sort of preference, as all that ultimately depends on the story and the partner, BUT! It's very unlikely that I'll be open to our characters becoming romantically involved quickly! Please keep that in mind, before reaching out!

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Castlevania (the animated series, not the games), Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! While I don't expect a college-grade essay by any means, I do like when someone's opening message gives me a good idea of who am I talking to. What I do want to know is how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete in terms of ideas, so don't worry, I am not asking that of you, either! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

Hey, I'm Korean. I used to live in London for a while.



I'm currently in Seoul, Korea, and I recently met a British guy who came here for work. He's a friend of my friend's boyfriend. We exchanged Instagram and messenger IDs and started texting.



We began chatting and made plans to meet up that weekend. When we met, we went to a caf√©, had lunch, drank coffee, and had a great conversation. I thought things went well. (I couldn't drink alcohol at the time due to a temporary health issue, so we met during the day.)



The following week was a national holiday in Korea, and he suggested meeting up. However, I had to visit my hometown to see my parents and relatives, so we couldn‚Äôt meet. Instead, we planned to meet on Sunday, the last day of the holiday. In the meantime, he texted me first a few times, and we had some nice conversations.



On Sunday, we met again, had lunch, drank coffee, and talked a lot. He paid for lunch, and although he offered to pay for coffee as well, I insisted on covering it.



After the holidays, we both returned to our daily routines. Around Wednesday, I texted him first. It was a really cold and snowy day, so I messaged him about the weather and told him to take care not to catch a cold. We shared a bit about our day, but after that, there was no further conversation.



Then, on Sunday, I asked him if he wanted to have dinner together during the week and told him that I would treat him. He replied that he would be really busy that week and might be free on Friday, but he wasn‚Äôt sure. He said he‚Äôd let me know sometime during the week.



But now, it‚Äôs already early Saturday , and he hasn‚Äôt reached out to me at all...

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 21 years old of age, and older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to pose a problem, I am really not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying any alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. As much as I feel bad to say this, I'm not comfortable with writing with someone completely new to this hobby. I'm sorry!
7. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine and has half-way functioning train networks, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings.

We‚Äôve been NCL fans before as we had enjoyed 5 cruises between 2013 and 2020 but with Covid and other types of vacations we hadn‚Äôt been on NCL since January 2020. We did a cruise in 2023 on the MSC Mervilgia that we loved. 

Anyways, we were excited for this one but I have to say, while it was ok, it didn‚Äôt wow us like previously. Except for the final night where we dined at Food Republic, we hadn‚Äôt been on our dinners at Manhattan Room, Taste and Savor but we found the service to be slower, choices were not great and the food in general was not great e.g. requested med rare steak on Tuesday, it came more well done but it took so long(45 mins) that I didn‚Äôt bother to complain. Also, my wife is celiac and dairy free, we had filled out the forms before hand and I called NCL the week before to make sure they were aware. So everything with her requests took forever like asking for almond milk for coffee takes 20 minutes, I get nice rolls at dinner while she gets a toasted gluten free bread after a half hour. She pre ordered her dinners a few times the night before but I don‚Äôt get the point of that when it still takes a long time for her dinner to come. We did complain at guest services but we never got a call back. Overall the food was a disappointment. Food Republic was great however.

We saw our cabin steward when we first got to our room but right away was trying to tell us his life story and kind of inferring he appreciates tips etc. I thought that was a bit tacky. Also, his service wasn‚Äôt great, I‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt vacuum the floor everyday and once he left some cleaning clothes on the floor between the bed and the balcony.

Some of the performers were not that great like the Golden Duo. We tried to see the band at the Pour House but both times the doors were already closed due to capacity. Maybe they should perform at a bigger venue?

The ship overall was good, loved Spice2o, the gym was a little small but was good. 

We were disappointed overall but we feel service and food have gone down considerably to the point where we were NCL fans and now will look to other cruise lines in the future. ",8,1739623969.0,NCL,9,0.79,False

I‚Äôve struggled with these symptoms since I was a little girl. For years, I was in and out of the hospital, bouncing from one gastroenterologist to another, and feeling completely dismissed.

Despite the severe symptoms I experienced, no one considered gastroparesis as a possibility. I was always on the heavier side, and I kept hearing that gastroparesis was something that only affected thin people. It was incredibly frustrating to have my concerns downplayed, to the point where I started believing that maybe it was all in my head.

Every couple of days‚Äîor sometimes every couple of weeks‚ÄîI would be in excruciating agony for a day or two. My belly would distend to the size of a nine-month pregnant woman, and I‚Äôd end up throwing up until it looked like wet coffee grounds. There were moments when all I could do was rock back and forth for hours until the pain eventually subsided or until I was sedated with promethazine and whatever else they could offer.

After countless CT scans and endless doctor visits, I finally had a breakthrough when one compassionate doctor ordered a gastric emptying study. That study revealed that my symptoms were due to gastroparesis. It was both a relief and a bitter reminder of how long I had suffered without an answer.

It‚Äôs been 2 years since my diagnosis and I guess knowing is great and validating but the symptoms seem to get worse over time. I am a type 2 diabetic but I don‚Äôt have extreme unruly blood sugar, I‚Äôm considered managed. The pain and suffering I experience on a regular basis has been enough to make me feel so defeated and based on some of the posts I‚Äôve read here- I‚Äôm one of the luckier patients with this. My heart absolutely breaks for you all and how awful you‚Äôve had it. It reminds me to be grateful because it could be so much worse.

I am hoping to gain some insight into the right treatment options for me.. I‚Äôve read that the pacemaker surgery is like a permanent solution and I‚Äôm really hopeful I can get that since drugs like reglan can cause permanent face paralysis and other awful side effects and Botox wears off after so many months and needs to be redone. 

My symptoms are becoming more frequent and more unmanageable. I find it‚Äôs every couple days now, and I can always tell what‚Äôs coming when I start tasting those weird soda fizzy burps (without having had anything carbonated). That‚Äôs always how I know a BAD episode is about to body me. I‚Äôve dropped 60 pounds in the last 4 months, so I‚Äôm not on the heavier side any more but it seems like if something doesn‚Äôt change soon I‚Äôm going to be in trouble.

I‚Äôm here to connect with others who truly understand this journey. I‚Äôd love to hear your stories, tips, and advice on managing this condition. Thank you for letting me share my story‚ÄîI‚Äôm looking forward to finding support and solidarity in this community.

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 21 years old of age, and older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to pose a problem, I am really not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying any alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. As much as I feel bad to say this, I'm not comfortable with writing with someone completely new to this hobby. I'm sorry!
7. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine and has half-way functioning train networks, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

The action in series mentioned below is a fairly good representation of how, more or less, do I like action in my stories:

Vinland Saga (on the more conservative end), Fullmetal Alchemist, Castlevania (the animated series),  Inuyasha (on the more whacky end)

While I understand that to many of you it is probably too much, I'm unfortunately only willing to compromise so much when action is concerned. (Such as, I do like comically oversized swords every once in a while, but I don't need those in order to be happy!) So, let me repeat myself: before reaching out to me, please make sure that all that I've just said sounds up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

To elaborate a bit more on romance, as I feel it's important: my approach to romance is that I love to have it, and I love to write it, *but* that it should be, at the end of the day, just a sub-plot. Not that it cannot feature into the main plot at all. That'd be silly! What I mean is that should the romance element be excised from the story, we'd still end up with a coherent, intact storyline. I also generally speaking prefer a more slow-burn sort of approach, where it takes quite some time before the characters enter any sort of relationship, *especially* when it's our lead characters. It's not a 'do or die' sort of preference, as all that ultimately depends on the story and the partner, BUT! It's very unlikely that I'll be open to our characters becoming romantically involved quickly! Please keep that in mind, before reaching out!

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Castlevania (the animated series, not the games), Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! While I don't expect a college-grade essay by any means, I do like when someone's opening message gives me a good idea of who am I talking to. What I do want to know is how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete in terms of ideas, so don't worry, I am not asking that of you, either! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

I hope to hear from you, and I hope you have a wonderful day or night!",1,1739623829.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

It's just me ranting Abt my dad and the shitty relationship I have w him. This will be long.  Tldr: my dad's a prick and has been ruining my family for as long as I can remember.

For as long as I can remember my family has always been absolutely terrible. My dad was a druggie, my mom was never home, and my siblings and I were always detached from one another. My dad has been a main problem throughout all of this though. When I was little my dad used to take drugs constantly he was in and out of this druggie Hayes and was verbally and mentally abusive towards my siblings and I, he was extremely verbally abusive towards my mother as well. So despite all of this I used to be a major daddy's girl. That's changed. I remember he used to come into my room at night and steal my money. One time I woke up and he had been looking through my vanity, which was right next to my bed.  As he was opening it, it mad a loud creaking noise so it woke me up. I looked at him wondering what he was doing and he said, ""daddy needs to borrow some money, ill give it back later."" He left the room for discussion and told me to go back to sleep. He never gave that money back. I remember one time I had woken up and he wasn't home and I found out that he had been arrested for stealing not only my money but my mom's card and withdrawing money from it so we could go buy drugs, and her jewelry. He had also taken my favorite movie at the time which was Brave. I was very upset about that cuz I really loved that Disney movie. I remember crying about it you know as a kid because I really loved that movie. But I never got it back. Throughout my childhood that whole story repeated. My dad would go to jail only to come back steal more shit go on more drugs and then go to jail again. Throughout that whole time though I still loved my dad. One time he came back home and he had been home for quite some time. He and my mom would fight a lot. He used to wake us up in the middle of the night, and he would tell us about how terrible my mom is and how terrible she treats him and try to turn us against her. He was lightly physically abusive too. So I don't know if you could consider it abuse. I remember he was sitting on the couch charging his phone in the power strip. He had gotten up to make coffee and I was around 6 maybe 7. I had taken the end of the charger that plugs into your phone and put it in the socket of the power strip so I could get it out the way not realizing that could cause a fire. So I had gotten up shortly before my dad had gone and sat back down when he sees it and he calls all of my siblings to line up in front of the fireplace, myself included. He took his belt off and he started whipping us one by one I remember I had marks from where the metal hit me from his belt. I had stood there for a while while he whipped us one by one asking who did it. He claimed he would stop once one of us admitted to it so I did. I told him that I was the one who put it in the power strip. But he told me ""no you didn't"" even though I had. He then proceeded to continue to with us one by one myself included even though he fully believed that I did not do it and I can't remember anymore if he had finally stopped because my mom had intervened, or if my siblings lied and said that one of them did it, or if he finally believed me. He ended up going back to jail a while after that I remember one time when I actually had a bonding experience with my siblings, but the only reason was because our dad had been taking a jail by the cops that night. None of us could sleep after that. So after my mom had finally left for work, my siblings and I were all piled on the couch and made a Minecraft world labeled ""no Shrek shit"" because we kept making Shrek jokes a joke in our delirium. On the day after my 6th grade graduation my mother had gotten my daughter arrested again and filed for a restraining order, we ended up moving to Kansas which is quite far from where I lived before. I had left all my friends, and it was for another man that my mom wanted to be with. I'm not going to elaborate on him. One time we came back down to where I currently live so we could visit my dad and the rest of our extended family. We ended up meeting at a dairy Queen and he had been dropped off by his now ex-girlfriend April. Now April didn't seem to like me or my siblings or my mom much, anytime I saw her she would always give us these dirty looks as if we were trying to steal my dad from her. But now I'm like go ahead and keep him like you know üíÄ. But anyway we had met at a dairy Queen and he ended up abandoning us that night that's a dairy Queen. I remember he talked to himself pretty much the whole night when we were there, and when I would ask you it always claim that the demons in his head were talking to him or something. That's how I knew that the drug she was on was fucking him up. That day after he abandoned us at the dairy Queen with no explanation no hey I'm leaving I love you no I got to go by like nothing he mentally stopped being my father. I became emotionally detached from him to the point where I started referring to him as my sperm donor because he was no longer my dad he was just the guy who happened to impregnate my mom. Months and months go by and I've moved in with my aunt back in the state that I lived in previously before Kansas. And then my mom apparently started to see him again. I did not approve, I made it known that I did not approve. However she still did it, and we proceeded to move back in with him before my freshman year. I did not want to move in with him and I wanted to stay living with my aunt. I was forced to go by my mom who claimed that she was going to call the cops if I didn't go. I moved back in with them eventually and shortly after my freshman year of high school started. That year he gave me so many talks about how sex is the devil and it's an addiction like those monster cans you got. I did not like it, it made me uncomfortable. I had told my mom about it and he still made comments but I couldn't just tell my mom again because he ignored her. Finally he stopped and it was relatively normal. I tried to have that relationship with him again so he would stop being you know checked out of my head as my dad instead have him actually be my dad. It never worked because he always found some excuse to say no I don't want to spend time no no I can't. I had asked him to play a game with me and he said no I can't do that anymore I'm not high like I used to be so I don't know how to play anymore I told him he could learn he just refused. Months go by and everything's somewhat fine. One day he complains to my mom about how the house stinks, but then he decides he wants to take my mother and my siblings and I out to the river to hang out and spend time. He ended up going off on her and punching a hole in the wall because she said no I'm not going because you want the house to smell better. She was tired of him complaining so she decided to clean house. He punched a hole in the wall and called her all sorts of names, I ended up defending her because she had just gone quiet and just sat there and let it happen. He ended up calling me an assortment of names one of them stuck out to me, a ""whore."" My dad had never once called me a w**** before then. And it stung, that's the day when any chance of ever having a relationship with him again was ruined. My sophomore year my older brother had literally beat me to the point where I couldn't wear necklaces without panicking and feeling like I was being choked by him again and I couldn't breathe and I had to be taken to my aunt's house. I later find out that you know despite his actions being his own, he was having pressure put on him to go to the military by my dad. He had also been getting woken up in the middle of the night to drive my dad to go get alcohol, you see my dad had traded one addiction for another. Druggie to an alcoholic. So my brother was apparently going through it as much as I was. I started spending time with him more and realize the amount of time for my dad would go into his room and try to talk to him about the military. It got to the point where my brother was scared to talk back to him and just had to sit there and go along with it so I was the one who stuck up for him. I've always been the argumentative one and so I defended my mom and my siblings with my life. Anytime he started an argument about or with any of my family I would always interject and make sure that he was the one who wasn't getting out with satisfaction of winning. One time I was in a fight with my little brother, I had gotten physical with him and beat him up. He put up a fight don't worry he's fine üò≠ but afterwards my dad had come in from off the porch drinking, he had started an argument with me kind of, he had screamed at my brother and I just shut the hell up because he did not want to be hearin and all that after he got off work. I yelled at him back to shut up and go drink on the porch like he always does, he ended up trying to get all up in my face and buff up to me as if he was going to hit me. I panicked and I hit him in the face before he could hit me, I had slapped in three times in a row, first was a backhand, second was front, and third was a backhand again. It still sounds so unreal but I lived through it and it felt good to hit him like that because I was never able to stand up to him like that. It felt liberating. After sophomore year it had gotten so bad to the point where we had moved cities over the summer, so that we can get away from him again, yet my mom still lets him come over. I don't want him over. He's one of those guys that's okay to be friends with when you're not over at his house but when you're over at his house it's like you're there with the devil. He's been staying for days on end, I don't like it. It makes me scared that he's going to quite literally crash out again to the point where I'm constantly wondering, ""what if he hits us? what if he does this, what if he does that?"" I don't I don't want to live like that. He's coming over for my birthday, I don't want him there. I want to turn 18 without the stress of my life being at the house where there should be none. I just want to have a nice day with my mom and my siblings in my best friend but I can't because he has to be there for the nice day that will probably get ruined because of him. He's going to be showing up with my mom and I are out doing things for my birthday and I feel like he's going to throw a hissy fit the moment I see him for not being able to come along. I just don't want him to ruin that for me. I'm already scared of becoming an adult I don't want to be scared of my day of becoming an adult be ruined. I've already mentally checked out of whatever relationship I had with him. He doesn't feel like my dad anymore. I just need a place to vent this out because my birthday is in 5 days. I've needed to talk about this I have, I've talked about this with my best friend but I need to talk to this about someone who can just listen only listen and actually be able to have it hang out there and the no and be able to get that feeling of having that weight off your chest.

You've become increasingly familiar with aspects of Masonese grammar, including verbs and numbers, times and dates. Now, let's begin to engage with day-to-day Masonese that you would need, beginning with a trip to the caf√©. We'll introduce some vocab, go over how to ask questions, and watch Nyo order something from the coffee shop.

*U buaem malaesh valothi veg hiepsi sul legina demasiebaski, kthƒÅgra navi og tond, msao og kalishet. Thua, alo kain naba veg masiebaski devestra ath u ve nin, kaiagra veg voye or ejulyet. O sas syrin esos vaiva, prajo h≈´a nepaish tsema, og vat Nyo sa paishe sitra po emagar sul juli.*

Vocab:

* Coffee = juli
* Black coffee = juli denan/demelƒìna
* White coffee = juli deblanth/dalƒìblanth
* Latte = juli devaksara
* Tea = khai
* Green tea = khai devera/devolovera
* Milk = vaksa
* Sugar = her
* Cup = daor
* Take-away = guatage
* Sit-in = psuatsure
* Pastry = elhani
* Hot = khua
* Warm = ansa
* Cool = edha
* Cold = thu
* Iced = entsa/veg entos

(Comment below if you'd like any more vocab!)

So, how do we ask¬†**questions**¬†in Masonese?

*Tsoy, ts'o paish tsema h≈´a da masiebaski?*

To ask a question in Masonese, we do not change the structure of a sentence at all. All we do is add the participle *tsem*, regularly shortened to *ts'*, to the start of the sentence:

* You are going to the shop = u nejo ro emagar
* Are you going to the shop? = ts'u nejo ro emagar?
* I can get you what \~
* What can I get you = ts'a per akun u d≈´a?

Simply put, create a normally sentence and then add the participle, that is all. Here's some question words to help you out, of course they normally go right at the end of the sentence:

* What = d≈´a
* Where = l≈´a
* Why = ps≈´a
* When = ks≈´a
* Which = kth≈´a
* Who = th≈´a (often at the start, replacing a subject pronoun)
* Whose = ms≈´a
* How = h≈´a
* How many/much = mesk
* How long = vili

Let's see Nyo order from the caf√©:

**[Original Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ibfkfk/aita_for_refusing_to_sing_at_my_brothers_wedding/) - January 27th 2025**

My (28M) brother (33M) will be getting married in the fall. The two of us are fairly close, more so in the past few years, which is to say that he is not ignorant about past events in my life.

Recently, I got invited to dinner by him and his fianc√©e. The two were very obviously buttering me up to ask me something the whole time before my brother finally told me:

""So, [fianc√©e] and I have been talking, and we'd really love it if you sang our first dance song, just the one song. I know you don't really sing anymore, but I dug up some old videos of you singing and she loves your voice just as much as I do. This could be your wedding present to us!""

For background: I used to sing all the time. I formed a band with a bunch of my friends in high school, and we were very minorly successful. We had a YouTube channel with a few hundred subscribers, and there were a handful of people that had their own recordings that were posted to their own pages.

In this band was my best friend since second grade, Mason (not real name). Unfortunately, when we were 17, Mason took his own life. Additionally, I was the one who found him.

The band dissolved almost immediately, and our YouTube channel and all our own videos were taken down. Since then, I have NEVER sang. Singing without Mason felt wrong, so I didn't. Not in the shower, no karaoke sessions, not at church, never.

My brother knew all of this, but I wasn't sure if his fianc√©e did, so I started off with ""Sorry, I'll have to refuse. You know I don't sing anymore"" in the interest of not totally ruining dinner.

My brother was annoyed as hell at this. ""Come on, it's for my wedding, it's just one song, I'm not asking for much here"" and so forth.

I continued to politely refuse and left soon after. Shortly after, I start receiving countless calls from my mom, who also knows the reason why and decided to harass me about not singing. ""It's your brother's wedding! I think you really should see a therapist about this, we all love your singing voice and it's been 10 years since any of us got to hear it!""

The two have since decided on a new tactic by saying that my song will be a good way to honor Mason's memory.

The point about therapy aside (I've been to lots of it. I'm at peace with my decision to stop singing) AITA for refusing? It's clearly important to them.

EDIT: To clarify, I have really only ever performed with Mason. The joy I got from performing was not the act of singing itself, but from performing with my best friend.

*Additional edit from OOP (in Comments)*

Ok y'all, this is... overwhelming. Let me throw a few things in one.

* I don't know if my future SIL is aware of the full situation or not. I'd like to think she doesn't, but I'd rather not poke that hornet's nest until I have to.

* Yes, I HAVE been to therapy. Singing is something I did with Mason, well before we started a full band. It very much feels like a part of my life that belongs in the past. As I said in the edit, my joy is not from singing, it's from performing with him.

* ""Is that what Mason would have wanted?"" I don't know. He's not around to ask anymore.

* The ""extended family"" is not ""blowing up my phone."" It's two people, and it's not blowing it up. My mom called repeatedly in one day, and has tried to throw it in a few times since. My brother is mostly giving me the cold shoulder. It's only been a few weeks since this conversation took place.

* To whomever said ""its been 10 years, you're not good enough to sing at a wedding,"" thank you. I genuinely laughed at this. It's a good point too. I'd probably sound like a donkey kicked me in the throat.

* No, I don't post a lot. This is a throwaway I barely use.

**u/Bigstachedad**

>*It's your voice and your choice. Your brother, mother and, more than likely your brother's fiance, know why you no longer sing. Just because it's a wedding doesn't mean you must revisit your trauma. NTA.*

**u/SirEDCaLot**

>*OP- reach out to the fiancee privately. Ask her to meet for coffee at a starbucks or something. Explain to her the reason why you don't sing. If you can do it without re-traumatizing yourself, DON'T sugar coat anything. Explain just how traumatic it was. Use a lot of imagery. Talk about how there was your friend, your band mate, the person who was there every time you sung, dead and what his body looked like. Don't hold back. Ideally she'll be looking a little green around the gills when you're done describing your experience.*

>*Tell her that every time since then you've even thought of singing, that image is what comes in your head. And if she has any respect for you at all, she will understand that you want the wedding to be a happy thing, and not have thoughts of discovering your dead friend. Furthermore, you hope she can understand this is YOUR decision, and it's not a chapter of your life you're willing to revisit right now.*

>*And I say this with full respect- if she doesn't understand and accept that- just stop trying with them. Go to the wedding if you want or don't. Because brothers are supposed to respect each other, and then not respecting your 'no' answer is totally disrespectful.*

>*If family gets ganged in on this, write out every gory detail of the trauma and post it for all of them to read. Whoever reads that and still tries to tell you to sing, just block them out of your life. People like that are not a support system or a positive influence, your life is better off without them.*

Ok, idk if I have to do anything special to update people that commented Updateme on the last post, but here we are.

This is premature, but since the post I made was more popular than I expected (or wanted), I thought I'd give a small update.

Future SIL reached out to me because her washer broke and she wanted to come over and do a quick load of laundry. I wasn't thrilled about this, but I live close enough, I have in-unit, and the laundromats in our area are not the safest.

I was content to just watch TV silently in my tiny apartment while we waited, but she of course had something to discuss. I thought for sure she'd be the third person to try to convince me, but no.

Instead she told me that she wasn't sure if my brother was giving her the full story. She told me that ""he used to sing all the time, he was in a band, but he quit when the band broke up."" (Which is technically true, but come on).

I also learned that he had told many of his friends this too, about how he's always trying to convince me to come around and sing for all of them. He had literally never asked before THE conversation, but was prone to making comments like ""boy it sure sucks you don't sing anymore, I know a lot of people that would want to hear that.""

So, I very briefly told her about Mason. Just the important bits. That I used to sing with him, then he died, so I don't have any desire to do so anymore.

She didn't say anything for awhile, but I saw her face go through about a dozen different emotions, and I'm pretty sure she settled on anger.

Before she left, she just told me that she's going to tell my brother to get someone else to sing. I got the distinct feeling that it's not going to be a pleasant conversation.

So, that's it so far. All quiet. Fingers crossed.

**Edit from OOP (in Comments)**

Hi ya'll: again the response on this have been much here larger than anticipated. I just need to get something off my chest and hopefully I don't come across as overly aggressive.

Regarding the obnoxious comments saying ""Is that Mason would want???""

I don't know, he's not around to ask anymore. The dead tend to not have opinions.

I've had over a decade to process this. Via THERAPY (putting it in all caps this time). But I truly hope the people who comment this don't ever try this approach on someone who just experienced a loss. Regardless of intentions, it is grossly manipulative.

And again, for the people in the back: I didn't stop singing because I thought that's what Mason would want or survivor's guilt or because I was actually secretly in love with him (yes, real DM I received). I stopped because I loved singing with my musical partner, who is now gone. I no longer find the act enjoyable.

Today, we review the fourth section, ‚ÄúAbutsu-bo‚Äôs Seeking Spirit Toward Nichiren.‚Äù We will learn here ‚Äúthe decisive importance of the heritage of faith in overcoming the sufferings of birth and death.‚Äù One key to this is ‚Äústriving with the same commitment as the mentor.‚Äù

In addition to what we have learned about Sairen-bo, Sensei introduces us to the elderly Abutsu-bo, another one of his followers in Sado.

>Abutsu-bo can be considered a leading representative of the followers, one who shared in the heritage of faith during Nichiren‚Äôs day and thereby overcame the sufferings of birth and death and attained Buddhahood in his lifetime. 

After Abutsu-bo passed away, Nichiren wrote a letter to the widow Sennichi about her deceased Abutsu-bo:

>Some may wonder where the spirit of the late Abutsu-bo may be at this moment. But by using the clear mirror of the Lotus Sutra to reflect his image, I, Nichiren, can see him among the assembly on Eagle Peak, seated within the treasure tower of Many Treasures Buddha and facing toward the east (WND-1, 1042).

I am going to skip over an excellent summary of how Abutsu-bo supported Nichiren during the perilous years on Sado. Let's pick up here:

>The deceased Abutsu-bo, we are told, now resides in the pure land of Eagle Peak and is facing the Buddhas inside the treasure tower with the same earnest spirit with which he sought out Nichiren during his life. We can take this to mean that disciples are certain to attain Buddhahood if they strive in faith with a seeking spirit toward the teacher who expounds and practices the Mystic Law.

Getting back to what Eigenstien-Over-the-Hedges calls (referring to me) ‚ÄúMY fantasy life,‚Äù I had quite a few life-and-death experiences when I was in Europe, but I was an addict then and my inner life was so shriveled and frozen that I was unaware. Since returning, I got sober, returned to counseling, and started working and living a productive life. Then I started practicing Buddhism and began a family. That frozen inner life has started to thaw and I am aware of life-and-death matters.

As I have shared in my recent posts, I am now addressing my hypersexuality (HS) in many ways. Here is an important Buddhist concept: one inner shift at the deepest level causes a ripple effect as it permeates outward. This is what's happening to me right after I began addressing HS.

For three years, my guitar has been living inside of its case, hardly ever seeing daylight. I was in a creative block. But yesterday afternoon I was having coffee with Dee and Bernie. I said, let's go to the Daycare. I want to sing to the children. We hopped into the car.

I took out the guitar and began tuning it. The older kids were very involved in this and that and showed little interest. But the one and two-year-olds circled around me. I sang a few songs and they clapped, tapped, and swayed. One of the teachers asked whether I knew any songs about ice-skating. Yes, I had had had fun with the Twinmen and Twinettes with this stop-and-go song I had found on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@music_for_kiddos/video/7202245158086167850). The teacher brought out some paper plates and the next thing I knew, we were all ‚Äúice-skating‚Äù  around the room. The crawlers were ‚Äúice-crawling.‚Äù We had so much fun! The Three Sisters invited me back for next Friday. My creative block was dissipating (at least in front of a toddler audience).

How is this all relevant to today's study material? According to Buddhism, life is a succession of moments that appear and die. So all of us are experts in life-and-death. It's what we do with each moment that counts!

So I dragged out of the basement the dirtiest, most shameful carton of my life, my HS. I am OPENLY talking about it and taking action. The next thing I know, the guitar came out and I played for a small group of one and two-year-olds. 

Hypothetically, perhaps I am just ‚Äúice-crawling.‚Äù But it sure feels good!

Today will be a busy day. We are opening up the RV Park to the community for our winter festival. We are expecting moderate snowfall this afternoon so we should have lots of fun! 

We will have urns and urns of hot chocolate. Dee right now is leaching acorns and she will be making her famous Haudenosaunee Hot Rock stew!

Immigrants in the UK. We have jobs plus trying to start a small business/start-up together on the side that we're passionate about. This means we've been working in our free time too, we're so exhausted and we have no one to help with anything, no family here, not many friends. We live in one room apartment and don't have where to eat, but we do all the side business there, so we're tense day to day. We both had burnout and job problems recently. This is all relevant to explain the daily stress as it is what caused my husband's outburst. He's usually very kind and nice, very supportive. We love each other a lot. 
Recent stress: 
He's been having more anxiety attacks recently because of climate change and all that's happening in the world. So, the outburst happened a day after our very successful event presenting our start-up idea. We both worked super hard to prep, but he did more physical work hauling things and making prototypes. I did more mental work and made the event happen. Also, I had no issues, but his job scolded him for asking to leave early before our event. So he's under pressure. We can't afford to lose our day jobs. The night before the event, I was telling him how excited I was for the event, how much I loved him and the flowers he bought me that day. Admittedly it was late and I talked too much. He responded by raising his voice, telling me how I'm disrupting his sleep. That's fair but he was needlessly hurtful, imitating me a bit and saying I'll sleep and snore without issues but he'll be the one who'll stay awake because of my talking just before we fall asleep. I cried myself to sleep.

The event went well the next day. The day after, I had signed us up to another smaller event. It didn't require that much work and prep but we were incapable of any prep! I was too optimistic I guess. It was hard to wake up ... He was supposed to print out our deck/catalogue, but he kept having problems with the files, the printer, everything. I asked many times how to help, but I didn't understand his technical problems so he was just getting more annoyed. He ended up shouting in my face REALLY LOUD, the worst thing in our lives I've seen, he got all red and shaking. He started breaking some of our things for the side business from the night before. He's not usually like this, this might be the third time over a decade. But it was so scary and undeserved (yes, although I signed us up for the second event too close, he did agree to it at the time. And although my questions ended up being annoying, I didn't do it to annoy him, I think intent should count. Also, I was tired too and stressed, not just him.)I also started the day with making coffee and breakfast for us both and washing the dishes while he played video games. This is rare, he usually does equal if not more housework. But knowing how tired we were, I wanted to start the day by taking on more tasks, knowing the printing will fall on him later. 
I started crying and shaking from shock. He calmed down and said he feels better after shouting so he'll keep working to do the thing for me. I said he shouldn't bother and to give up. I said I'll go to the event without, just with some business cards. He tried to come with me to the event, followed me out on the street ,but I said I need to be alone and go to the event alone. I need some space. He was saying how he wants to be together, have dinner and hang out and that his day will be bad without me. That he has no other plans for the day. It feels more like I'm needed to cater to him,felt like I have an obligation, didn't feel good. 
Anyway, I went to the event alone. I felt horrible. He texted me he loved me, he said we're just stressed and to forgive him. I said I forgive him, but do I? What choice do I have? I'm alone here. There's no one to even stay the night with who I'm not ashamed to tell why. I can't tell our friends this and then keep hanging out with them as a couple. It'll be weird I think. I can't blow up our marriage over one bad day and he has never hurt me physically and this shooting is so rare. He's been my biggest cheerleader, we've supported each other financially at different times when one of us lost their job, we are always talking and he's so affectionate every day. He brings me coffee in bed almost every morning, he does housework, he listens to me vent, he praises me to everyone who would listen. He tells me I'm the best tging in his life. Is this stress and life uncertainty causing an eruption that's a fluke and not the start of a violent marriage? I've heard bad things start small, so I need outside perspective. 
Thank you for reading this long long long meandering post.

1iq0agq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1iq0agq/bisalp_consult_to_post_op_appt_long/,Bisalp - consult to post op appt - long!,"Hey there! I had my bisalp on Jan. 7th and I thought I‚Äôd throw my entire experience into the sub as well. I‚Äôm 32F, living in Pennsylvania, long time partner with no children, currently on my fourth nexplanon. I had been wanting to go down the sterilization road for a while now. I was going to before my last nexplanon was inserted but I was overdue for that so I figured it was just easier to get my fourth and get my ducks in a row for sterilization instead of just saying ‚ÄúI want it‚Äù. 

Consultation:

I hadn‚Äôt been to my obgyn practice in two years. I scheduled on Nov. 6th for my annual exam, and got an appointment Nov. 13. I see a physician assistant so I knew I‚Äôd have another step to see the gynecologist, but I figured this was the best first step still. I get to my appointment, she asks if I have any questions, I tell her I want to do sterilization and she immediately went ‚ÄúOh! That‚Äôs easy! I‚Äôll have them schedule you to see a Dr. and get you going on that when you leave‚Äù I was prepared to have to stick up for myself and I was so relieved I didn‚Äôt have to that day. I left my appointment and at check out I got to schedule to see a gynecologist, the first open appointment was Nov. 15 so I took that. I looked them up and they weren‚Äôt on the child free list but I figured I‚Äôd take my chances and see someone else if need be. 

Two days later I get to see the gynecologist. He asks what I‚Äôm there for and I say I want to go with sterilization and he also immediately said we can do that. He went over the percentage of people who regret it later (iirc he said 20%?), vasectomies are an easier procedure, other long term birth control options, and complications that can arise from the surgery itself. None of it was offered in a way to try to sway my mind, he was just doing his due diligence for informed consent. I just told him I was sure that I didn‚Äôt want children and I wanted something permanent compared to long term birth control. He agreed with my decision and said he‚Äôd have the surgery scheduler talk to me before I left that day. 

I get to check out, then I had to wait a few minutes for the scheduler. She took me back to her office and she went over waivers with me, setting up my pre-op physical and bloodwork appointments (Dec. 9th), my surgery date (Jan. 7th) and my post-op appointment (Jan 28th). She gave me a paper on calling for the pre anesthesia screening questionnaire, and my papers that need to be filled out for my physical with medical history and such. I was told I wouldn‚Äôt know the time of surgery until the day before when the office called me to let me know. 

Pre-operation:

My pre-op physical was a breeze. I haven‚Äôt had prior surgeries and I don‚Äôt take any medications so that makes it easy for me there.  They took two vials of blood from me - one for a CBC and one for a pregnancy test. I was told that they would do a urine dipstick pregnancy test the day of surgery as well. 

Pre-anesthesia questionnaire was just basically going over more health history things and focusing more on any current issues with my health that could interfere with the surgery / anesthesia. Again, no previous surgeries and no medications made that extremely easy for me. They gave me the basic run down for the rules before surgery, and said that the hospital would call me the day before the procedure to let me know when to get there. 

The day before my surgery I got my call in the afternoon. They went over the same basic rules - no eating after 11pm, clear liquids up until 3 hours before, shower the evening before and morning of with the hibiclens soap, remove all jewelry, and no lotions. 

Day of:

I woke up at my normal time of 5:30, made a cup of tea to enjoy. They said I could have clear liquids until 6:30. I took my morning shower and got dressed into my comfiest clothes. I had to be to the hospital by 8:20. Checked in at registration and signed a couple more papers and got my wristbands while my partner went over to the security desk to sign in and get a name badge. 

Then we were off, went to the operating level lobby, got called back from there within a couple minutes of getting to the lobby. They took my weight, had me change into a gown and peed, I also took this opportunity to remove my piercings. I brought those out to my partner and he stuffed them in the little baggie I brought for my jewelry. Then they took my vitals and asked for my name, DOB, what I was there for. Went over some history stuff again. Rinse and repeat but a little more in depth with the pre op nurse before surgery. She wiped down my torso / pubic region with a disinfectant wipe twice before surgery and she mentioned they‚Äôd wipe me down a couple more times in the OR, then placed my IV and mentioned the Dr and anesthesiologist would be by to talk to me as well. 

My Dr. came by and went over informed consent again saying it‚Äôs permanent and non reversible and there are other options if I should so choose. I just told him I was absolutely sure and he asked if I had any questions about three times before he left just to be sure I had all the information I needed. 

My nurse anesthetist came by before the anesthesiologist. She asked me some of the same questions, but also went into more anesthesia related questions. Any family members have issues with anesthesia, if you have sleep apnea, they had me open my mouth and stick my tongue out. Then the anesthesiologist came by and asked the same things. I signed another waiver and I got my hair net put on. The one OR nurse mentioned I‚Äôd have to position my butt in a certain spot by the hole on the table, and she also mentioned that I‚Äôd be in stirrups for the procedure. She asked if I wanted to be positioned in the stirrups while I was awake or if it was okay to do it while I was under. I chose the latter. 

My nurse anesthetist told me to give my partner my goodbyes and she gave me the versed before wheeling me into the OR. I felt it probably 15 seconds after it was in my IV. I remember being wheeled in, moving to the operating table and then making sure my butt was in the right spot. Then they put blankets? Something over my arms, stuck monitors to my chest, and my anesthesiologist told me a joke about why did the baker go to the bakery and then I was out. 

First thing I remember waking up was my eyes felt watery and that I needed to clear my throat. I wiped my eyes and my nurse anesthetist saw me and told me to be careful around my eyes. She got a sleepy ‚Äúokayyy‚Äù and I did it again, and she asked if my eyes were done watering and I told her I thought so. She asked how I was feeling and I said I felt like I had a frog in my throat. lol. I didn‚Äôt really have any pain and zero nausea.

Then I remember my nurse telling me I was just getting some extra oxygen and I felt the mask on my face. I just closed my eyes and took some deep breaths and about 20 minutes later I was feeling more awake, but I didn‚Äôt really wanna open my eyes. I was offered some water and I gladly took it. The nurse said I looked like I was doing good and asked if she wanted me to go grab my partner. He had gone to find the bathroom and then grab a coffee and a breakfast sandwich and by the time he got back up to the lobby to wait for me they were looking for him. The Dr. told him how everything went and what to except post op, and he said that I was shaking off the anesthesia well. Apparently I surprised everyone with that? Then I got some apple juice and some graham crackers to eat to see how I‚Äôd handle that. I still only had minor cramping and very limited pain so I didn‚Äôt get anymore  IV meds. 

Probably a little over a half hour after my partner got back with me the nurse asked if I was ready to try to pee. I really didn‚Äôt feel like I had to but I figured why not. I had no issues getting out of the bed and to the toilet. I peed and there was a bunch of bright red blood, but that was compounded by the fact it was in a hat too. She had gave me a pad before she left the room so I used that and got dressed. During this I noticed my belly button had blood leaking. When I went out I told my nurse and she had me lay down on the bed and she cleaned it up and made sure it was just an ooze and not an active bleed. She packed some gauze in it and put a new bandage on and said if it kept bleeding to call the office but it looked fine. She also gave me a binder to take home to wear - which I have been and I‚Äôve been loving. 

Post Op:

We left the hospital right about 12:30. After leaving the hospital we went to the pharmacy to pick up my prescriptions and was home by 1:00. My partner shared his breakfast sandwich he never got to eat and then I warmed up some Mac and cheese I had made the night before and had that as well. I watched some shows and relaxed for a couple hours before getting up to slowly wander the house in the evening. Just standing around was nice and didn‚Äôt bother me at all. I placed a delivery order for some pads, stool softener, gauze, steri strips, and some snackies cause I deserved those. Lots of water, more x files, and some stool softeners before bed and that was my night. 

I slept so so the first night. I wasn‚Äôt in pain or anything, I just was trying to be mindful of how I was lying. I am a side sleeper usually so being on my back is different for me. I did make it to my side a couple of times, I just had to be careful getting there. I had gotten some sleep on the couch earlier in the evening so that probably didn‚Äôt help matters much either. 

I woke up and had to use the restroom. I grabbed a towel and rolled it up and held that against my incisions and made sure I took my time. I didn‚Äôt have any issues there thankfully. I tried to see how everything was feeling: no burning during urination, my throat wasn‚Äôt sore, but my incisions were more tender, and the gas bloating became a bit more noticeable, but I still wasn‚Äôt in much pain. Worst pain I experienced all day were some sharp cramps - mostly on my left side. They didn‚Äôt last long but did happen a couple times throughout the day. Some light pressure helped calm the cramps down. 

I showered a little later in the morning. I wanted to check on my belly button incision to make sure that it wasn‚Äôt bleeding still. I took what bandages I could off in the shower. I made sure I washed the area and my hands with the hibiclens again before removing them. A couple of my steri strips came off from the blood that oozed before I was discharged. When I got out I dried off my incisions with some gauze, and checked to make sure nothing was actively bleeding, which it wasn‚Äôt. I put some wound closure strips over the areas where my strips from the hospital came off. I put bandages back over the incisions as well and threw my binder back on. 

I took my time with my activities for the day. I went between watching tv and crocheting, to making some stuff in the kitchen. I made some flan cause I could and for dinner I made the meatballs I had prepped and froze before surgery, then it was a quiet evening from there. 

I stopped wearing the binder they gave me on my third day post op. I had very minimal bruising around my belly button. I was very bloated from the gas but it wasn‚Äôt painful for me, more just an overly full feeling instead of pain. 

A little random but I‚Äôve seen people ask about it - I have four cats, and of course the 17lb one has attachment problems. He‚Äôs great and only lays by my head / chest while in bed, but on the couch he HAS to be completely on my torso which he‚Äôs the same size as. I had been covering my torso with a pillow and he was not pleased with that but chose to lay on my lap. I‚Äôve been getting brave and covering my incisions with my hands and arms while he gets comfy and I remove them once he‚Äôs lying down. I haven‚Äôt had issues with doing that. 

Six days post op I went back to work. I do inventory control at a warehouse, but I don‚Äôt ever really pick up stuff so that‚Äôs a big help, I mostly wander around counting stuff. I got some stretchy jeans and a pair of corduroys and those were fantastic to not put too much pressure directly on my incisions. 

Overall, everything went very smooth. My care team was fantastic and they made it as painless as they possibly could. Recovery has been a breeze. I thankfully didn‚Äôt have any issues with my insurance (Aetna) I only checked their website to see what they said they‚Äôd cover for sterilization and it was something along the lines of ‚Äúmostly complete coverage but you may owe up to $500‚Äù. It‚Äôs been a month since my procedure now and the only thing I owe from almost $33,000 is $11.04 from sending my tubes to pathology. I would highly recommend the procedure if you want a permanent solution!

Let me tell you the day I did the opposite (and I also want to hear your stories like that now, this is refreshing !).


I was early middle school and my best friend told me I MUST get a boyfriend. She thought one dude, a friend of her would be perfect for me.

The afternoon passes by, we chat and chill.

I‚Äôm just happy I got my first boyfriend and he is cute ! 

1h after waiting for the bus my friend is like‚Ä¶ why did you do that ? You barely spoke to him and it was weird. 

The dude was kind enough to say thanks for the compliment but absolutely not.


I had no idea that happened that way and I was so so embarrassed.

I‚Äôm still confused as of today on why I did that but also why she told me he would be a perfect match if he wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm 29 now and still giggling/awkward about that story haha.

Really impressed with seeming improvement of my journaling practice at least - I don't have an option to write ""I'm so sad/angry/tired I don't want to write anything today"" and just leave it at that anymore, so the entries are a bit more meaningful, if trivial and absolutely not ""creative"" or ""artistic"".

However, I have some questions which I hope you'll help me find the answers to.

1. Main issue: the week was pretty hectic, so I didn't have time to complete any exercises. I may have a couple of hours to unwind today though. So, what's the better course of actions?
   1. try to cram some exercises into this limited time I have (drawback: I've skimmed through them, and they seem to require some introspection, rushing things along may not be proper)
   2. don't do exercises, just move on to Week 2 on Monday and try to do better in the future (drawback: it'll probably be hard to stop feeling like I'm not doing my best and get rid of FOMO; and if I'll try to do them during the next week/week after that, I'll just fail and feel bad about myself)
   3. consider this week to be Week 0 (warm-up week, if you will) in which I've been preparing myself for daily journaling practice (drawback: I've already done my artist's date, and it may sound stupid, but I feel like it'll be wasted in a way)
2. I rarely have enough time for the whole 3 pages first thing in the morning (ok, like fifth actually, I *need* my coffee and I can't write in my pajamas). Is it okay to finish the entry when I have time later in the day? Is it okay to just not have time in the day and stop at one, two, two and a half pages?
3. I write at turtle speed, it's really embarassing. I can take over an hour to fill up a page sometimes (which is probably part of the reason why I don't have time to write the whole three of them). I get distracted (even though I try really hard not to), I get lost, I fall into some weird trance-like state for 10-15 minutes sometimes. Is it normal? Does it ever get easier? Or am I just wired wrong?

I *know* none of those are an ideal way to do it, but letting the perfect be the enemy of good has bit me in my behind numerous times before. On the other hand, I don't yet know the boundary when the process becomes so imperfect it loses any shred of usefulness.

It started like any other Uber shift ‚Äî just me, my car, and the open road. But little did I know, today‚Äôs real challenge wouldn‚Äôt be traffic or difficult passengers. No, it would be the stank.

The first few rides were fine, until I picked up them. From the moment they slid into the back seat, the smell hit me like a punch to the face. A potent mix of fast food grease, stale cigarettes, and something‚Ä¶ unidentifiable but definitely unpleasant. I thought, Okay, it‚Äôs just one ride. I‚Äôll roll down the windows afterward.

But no amount of cracked windows could combat what these riders left behind. They exited the car, but their odor lingered like a bad memory. Every new passenger that entered after them probably thought I was the one who stank. Embarrassed and determined, I pulled over for an emergency deodorization mission.

First stop: gas station. I grabbed a bottle of water, but hydration wasn‚Äôt going to fix this. Next, I found an air freshener that claimed to eliminate even the most stubborn smells. Challenge accepted. I sprayed like my life depended on it. Still, the smell chuckled at my efforts.

Then came the deep clean: wiping down the seats with a vinegar-water mix I remembered from some random cleaning hack. I let the windows down to air it out while I grabbed a coffee to fuel the mission. Back at the car, I tossed in an open box of baking soda like a sacrificial offering to the smell gods.

Hours later, victory. The car smelled fresh again, as if the stank never happened. But I knew the truth. My car and I had survived a silent battle today, and I earned my fare‚Ä¶ plus a newfound respect for industrial-grade air fresheners.

Tomorrow? I‚Äôm keeping a mini cleaning kit in the trunk. Never again.",3,1739621589.0,uberdrivers,0,1.0,False

I stayed in Tamil Nadu for two years during my post-graduation, and there was this amazing restaurant on the highway that served a fantastic breakfast and the best South Indian filter coffee I‚Äôve had so far.

I currently use a 3-cup moka pot for my daily coffee, but it‚Äôs too small when I have guests over.

I am thinking of getting a South Indian coffee filter but have a few questions. I'd really appreciate your help!

Can I brew smaller quantities in a large filter, or should I get a smaller one (1-2 cups) too for when I‚Äôm just brewing for myself?
 
I have seen both brass and stainless steel options. Which one is better?

Brand recommendations: There are so many options at various price points. Does the quality vary much between them? Is it worth spending extra?

I saw an inexpensive one on the Cothas Coffee website, is it a good filter? And also for coffee grounds, is Cothas a good brand?

Thanks so much for your help!",3,1739621348.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
