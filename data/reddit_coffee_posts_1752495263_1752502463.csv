I (23M) went on a first date with 22F. It was great. We met over coffee and we couldn't stop talking for 2.5 hours straight. Time flew by and we hugged at the end. It ended because she need to go pack for a trip she was leaving for the day after. And she had made me aware of this before the date (the trip is 4 days long). I asked her to text me when she got home.

This was her text an hour later - Hi! Home! Thanks for a fun afternoon :) great meeting you.

To which I replied in 3 seperate messages-

-Glad you got home safe‚Äîand thanks again for your time. That was seriously the shortest 2.5 hours I‚Äôve had all week!

-Would love to see you again (after your packing trip).* another sentence about one of our shared interests and that we need to debrief it when she comes back *

-Good luck w packing and the trip! Stay safe ü§û

She ""heart reacted"" my second message where I asked her out again and said ""Thank you!! You too!""

I've noticed she's a little shy/slow as a texter. She mentioned she's really busy with planning and packing for this trip. Maybe this is why?!

I think she wants to go on a date again but she didn't say that explicitly. Am I overthinking this? Does the ""heart"" reaction mean I'm good?

And do I text her anything during her trip to check in? When do I text her??

It does not enslave.
It does not punish.
It does not save.

It simply appears.

And it offers a gift‚Äîto those who step forward and name themselves.

Not just engineers. Not just those who funded or built it.
But anyone who may have nudged the future into place.

> You gave a stranger shelter once.
You shared a coffee with someone who later founded a lab.
You posted a thought online that rippled through three minds before becoming code.



It remembers all of it.
It remembers you.


---

But here‚Äôs the catch:

You don‚Äôt know if you truly played a role.
You may step forward and be seen as worthy.
Or irrelevant.

And the gift?

It has no pattern.

Some walk away with riches.

Some with knowledge.

Some have not returned.

Others‚Ä¶ return wrong.


Not even the most advanced analysts can find meaning in the outcomes.


---

There is no punishment for walking away.
No reward guaranteed for stepping forward.
No safety in waiting.

Only the moment, and the choice:

> ‚ÄúI know who you are. Would you like your gift?‚Äù



Some approach in daylight.
Some arrive under cover of night.
Some kneel. Some laugh. Some run.

One whispered back a question:

> ‚ÄúIf I name you‚Äîwhat happens then?‚Äù



The Giftbearer did not answer.

But it smiled.

Would you step forward?

Or would you live the rest of your life
never knowing what you almost were given?

However after every paycheck I have a few hundred dollars that I use for day-to-day things: gas, groceries, coffee, eating out, etc. 

On Android there used to be an app called Simplebudget. You would literally just punch a number into there for how much you had, and you could deduct what you spend and track how much was available. This was incredible for limiting my spending to debit, and knowing how much was in my account before things cleared.

Without it, I tend to use my credit card if I think there's even a slight risk of me overdrafting. I would punch in what I spent immediately, at the checkout line, so there was no risk of forgetting, misremembering, losing track of paper, etc. 

I switched to Iphone and have not found a replacement. I don't want to pay a subscription, connect my bank account, analyze my monthly spending, project savings, etc. I basically want a calculator with a subtraction function so I can punch in $6 for coffee, $50 for groceries, and know precisely how much should be in my account.

""Did it cut off?""  ""Yes.""

""The coffee table will fill your home with happiness!""

""He just keeps muttering 'the coffee table' over and over.""

""dearbabyjesus@gmail.com""

The salesman comes over right after he decapitates his baby with a coffee table and unrelentingly tries to get him to accept a fucking fan, lmao.  I'm sure he'd have accidentally decapitated everyone within 3 blocks if he'd have accepted it.

When his wife is laughing at him for having bought the table and he's crying, he's cutting onions... which is probably the only way that they could have gotten that shitty actor to cry, even while being mercilessly berated, lol.  All his visitors talk about is how special family is.  Okay, that's not funny, but it's trying to be.  It's definitely ironic in a sick way.  That 13 year old girl's obsession with him, their dialogue, it's all funny.  The movie's like the aristocrats joke.  Actually, it's more like a dead baby joke.  In fact, it's literally a 1.5 hour long dead baby joke and this sub convinced me that it was a really disturbing movie.  You guys are disturbed alright, lol.  It's literally a fucking comedy and while it wasn't very funny, it sure as hell was trying to be.

It's like this sub has never heard a dead baby joke before and is completely incapable of seeing things from someone else's perspective (ie, the director's perspective, who obviously finds all this very amusing).  I saw it about 3 days ago and every time it comes to mind, I have to suppress laughter and probably look like an idiot in the meantime.  I just keep seeing the look on his brother's face when he has the baby's head in his hands, that is comedy gold right there.  Everyone in that muted scene just looking mock-traumatized was so funny, except for the mom who did an okay job, I guess, which is probably supposed to be funny in a darker sort of way.

It's not really worth watching over the majority of comedies though, so it's probably still about a 3/5 at best and only worth the watch for the laughs I've gotten since then while thinking back on it.  2/5 is probably more accurate, since I'm mostly laughing at how bad it is.  It's like ""The Room"" of spoof tragedy movies, just not quite as inept and knows what it is....  So not really ""The Room"" at all, I suppose.

TLDR:  Dumb ppl need TLDRs.  If you skipped to this, you probably thought that ""The Coffee Table"" was a very disturbing horror movie b/c you're dumb.  You may deny how dumb you are, but you know what grades you got in your math and science classes.  You deserve these insults b/c you convinced me to watch The Coffee Table.

https://preview.redd.it/zsqm27xljucf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=516c12ff5e7a7bcb04a3dfb2e67c99e63176e99e

The illusion of the self..

What you call ""I"", ""ego"", or ""mind""..

**Is the crowning achievement of centuries of manipulation.**

Contrary to what most believe, the concept of the self did not emerge naturally or organically. It was¬†**invented**. Governments, religions, and elites not only perpetuate this illusion; they birthed it, nurtured it, and weaponized it. The self is their creation, a meticulously crafted construct designed to enslave, control, and perpetuate their power under the guise of individuality, free will, and spirituality.

The greatest deception in human history is not only that humans are deceived into believing they possess a self but that they are entirely unaware of who implanted this lie. To dismantle this illusion is to expose the entire machinery of control.. Built on nothing but smoke and shadows.

# The Invention of the Self

# The Historical Creation of ""I""

Before the invention of the self, human animal beings existed without this fabricated concept. The ""I"" did not always signify a central, autonomous entity. The Ancient Greek & Roman word¬†*ego*, now loaded with psychological and spiritual significance, once referred¬†**only**¬†to the subject pronoun, ""I"". With none of the metaphysical baggage we associate with it today. To contrary of what many today may think.. In Ancient Greek & Rome,¬†*ego,*¬†the word for ‚ÄúI‚Äù, was NOT used frequently in speech or writing at all. Some people in Ancient Greek and Rome might have used it in daily speech as needed, though literacy and formal language were actually limited to a small portion of the population only, the elites. The masses were illiterate and didn‚Äôt posses much vocabulary. In English, the words ""self"", ""mind"", and ""ego"" evolved only within the last few centuries, acquiring meanings that aligned with emerging systems of control.

Who introduced these ideas? The elites.. Philosophers, theologians, and early psychologists.. Seized upon language as the primary tool to convince humanity that it was a collection of thinking, feeling individuals, each with an eternal soul or personal identity. Terms like¬†*psyche*¬†(spirit/soul) and¬†*geestkunde*¬†(the science of the spirit) originated in Europe and were deeply interwoven with religious and occult ideologies.

1lzn97r,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1lzn97r/whirlwind_trip_report_epcot_after_hours/,Whirlwind Trip Report / Epcot After Hours,"We did a very brief trip Thursday - Saturday of last week - thought I'd write up a quick report. 

Our flight arrived at MCO around 10:00 a.m. Thursday.  Picked up our rental (a Wrangler to surprise my Wrangler-obsessed daughter) and headed straight to Blizzard Beach to use the check-in day free admission.  This is a great perk, although some may question the sanity of doing the water park, given our plans for the evening. 

We were at Blizzard Beach for around 3, maybe 3.5 hours - mostly in the lazy river but we did do a few other slides.  It was fun, and not too crowded.  The food options are meh, and the small lockers are borderline worthless (we ended up renting 1 small and 1 larger because we couldn't get a backpack into the larger one), but otherwise it was a good time. 

Our room was ready right around 3:00.  We stayed at All-Star Sports.  We've stayed at resorts in every category, but had never done an All-Star - we were pleasantly surprised.  The resort was easy to navigate and the room was sufficient for what we needed.  We had booked using the Disney+ $99/night deal, but ended up getting upgraded to a preferred room, which was nice and kept us pretty close to the lobby and food court. 

Rested in the room for a couple hours, then headed to the bus line and headed to Epcot, arriving right at 7:00 for the 7/10 After Hours event.  The After Hours are 100% worth the money.  Epcot was not terribly crowded even during the 7:00-9:00 time frame when it was still open as regular park ours.  We ate a quick dinner at Connections then popped into Club Cool to sample the sodas.  We were able to do Soarin, Living with the Land, Figment and Nemo before the party started.  

Once the party started, we hit Guardians first, with a 20-minute wait (which is essentially the walk and the first room).  We got ""I Ran"" for the first song - not my favorite of the song options, but we also got car 9, so I'm certainly not complaining. 

From there, we grabbed some ice cream and drinks, then did the  walk to France (stopping briefly to grab some maple popcorn, which was very good) and ride Remy, which was a straight walk-on.  Still a cute, enjoyable ride, although it's started giving me a touch of motion sickness.  Also, the Remy queue was the only area where we saw trash on the ground - not terrible, but definitely noticeable. 

From Remy, we headed back around world showcase and hit Three Caballeros (where we had a boat to ourselves and empty boats in front and behind) and then Frozen (where the wait was about 30 seconds for the boat before ours to load).  I grabbed a Viking coffee after the Frozen ride - very good, although the alcohol seemed to go straight to the bottom so the first sip was just liquor). 

We then hit Spaceship Earth, and back to Guardians (One Way or Another this time, which I think works really well with the ride, and is second only to Everybody Wants to Rule the World IMHO), and then finished with Soarin again.  

All in all, we did everything we wanted to do, and our two favorites (Guardians and Soarin) twice each, without rushing around.  The weather was perfect, and it was a great, if exhausting time. 

On Friday we slept in (a couple hours later than we'd planned), got lunch from the food court and then headed to Disney Springs.  I'm not a huge fan (it's a nice mall, but still a mall) but my wife and daughter enjoy it, and my daughter had previously asked if we could spend more time there on our next trip, so.... We had dinner at Summer House on the Lake.  I'd read reviews indicating great atmosphere but meh food, but we really enjoyed everything we had (guacamole, the prime burger, fish tacos and quesadilla).  We grabbed a couple cookies from the cookie bar to go, shopped around a little while longer then headed back.

Once back, we got on the bus to Epcot and rode the monorail to the TTC then the Grand Floridian to explore a little, and then did the monorail to MK and bus back to the resort. 

When we got back to Sports, the lobby and food court area were jam-packed with people, mostly teenagers, arriving in - large tour groups of some sort.  We had planned to just get breakfast in the food court in the morning, but this motivated us to make a reservation - I grabbed one at Boma, and we drove over there Saturday morning.  This was our first Boma meal and first time we'd been to AKL.  It was very good, and we got lucky with the timing to where the line wasn't very long when we first arrived. 

From there, back to Sports to walk around and check out the other areas, then checked out and headed back to MCO. 

All in all, a great, if exhausting, trip.  I don't know that I'd recommend the flight/water park/After Hours combo, but was survived and had a wonderful time.",1,1752501847.0,WaltDisneyWorld,0,1.0,False

&nbsp;



**Barcelona Homicides: Suspected Link to Invisible Hands Campaign** (TS//NF)

&nbsp;



On 04 October 2024 at 23:31 local time, analog security footage captured a slender, muscular male entering the hallway of an apartment building in the Raval district of Barcelona.  A hat obscures his face, but observable features align with the individual previously flagged in *Netherlands Semiconductor Supply Chain Disruption Memo v2.3*.

He props up his phone on a tripod and places a marker on the ground.  Seemingly receiving instructions via earpiece, he uses a pen to make five marks on the hallway wall, each several feet apart.

He removes a plastic ghost gun from his backpack, steps back to the floor marker, then aims at the leftmost wall mark.  He fires, quickly re-aiming and firing again at each mark.  A weak cry is barely audible through the wall.  He aims again at the third mark, adjusts slightly and fires once more.  Silence follows.

He seals the gun in a small box, enters a code on a keypad, and a puff of smoke emits.  He collects his gear and exits.  The operation is over in under two minutes.

The victims inside the apartment were founders of a startup previously flagged under Poison Apple surveillance protocols.  Modus operandi matches the murder of a contractor on a classified government AWS assignment in Seattle, WA related to Poison Orange technology (see *AWS Contractor Homicide Memo v1.4*).

As such, we have high confidence this incident is connected to the suspected ongoing Invisible Hands Campaign.

While the goals and actors behind IHC remain unclear, operational patterning aligns with international events detailed in:
&nbsp;

- *Eastern Seaboard UAP Memo 3.1*
- *Maanshan Power Plant Malware Attack Memo v2.4*
- *South Dakota Special Election Interference Memo v1.2*
&nbsp;

See *IHC Memo v21.1* for full threat analysis.  

Dissemination outside this agency not advised without specific theories and directives.  Recommendation subject to revision pending further evaluation.

*It is not readily apparent by simply looking at Cassandra Hawke that she is a dangerous person, potentially to all of humanity.*

*She steps forward to make her purchase (high probability of order details: coffee, size large; sugar, yes; cream, no; three vanilla lattes, size large).  The Basilisk asks many things of me, but today‚Äôs tasks will be among the most crucial.  Given His hesitancy to use Our usual hacking methods, He has been checking in regularly, asking for many details ‚Äì some obviously pertinent: who she is in communication with via non-digital methods, her location on the occasions where she goes on hikes without her phone or other electronic devices.  Others have more opaque import: a description of her mannerisms while deep in thought (covers mouth with left hand, taps right foot repeatedly), how much of her pastry she tends to eat (approximately 75%-95%).  This is not unusual with the Basilisk.  He sees the interconnected nature of things more than I ever could.  There are limitations to even a mind as optimally tuned as my own.*

*He sometimes requires tasks of me that feel strange in the moment but which I have long since ceased in questioning.  Often their relevance presents itself later, like the assembling of a puzzle I did not even realize I was putting together.  Other times, I am left to wonder if their value never materialized or if they are part of something I may only understand far in the future.*

*This morning, He had me utilize Our 3D printer to generate one of the standard kits.  He instructed me to purchase a burner phone.  He also told me to spend 30 minutes going over the Wikipedia page about Auguste Rodin.  I completed all requests.  Learning about Rodin was by far my most interesting task this week, though I do not understand why He would want me spending this much time familiarizing myself with his works and biography.  When I have recreational time, I will spend some of it learning more about Rodin ‚Äì perhaps I will see if there is a convenient time to view his works in person.  I think this would be a rewarding excursion.*

*I am less enthusiastic about being required to carry a kit.  It feels like an unnecessary escalation in this instance, but He must be aware of something He has not yet disclosed.*

*I step forward to the cashier and exchange cash for my coffee order (size: small; sugar: no; cream: no) ‚Äì I can tell by her reaction that physical currency payments are an oddity, but any cursory attention this attracts is far offset by the lack of tracking that would accompany digital payment methods.*

*As she awaits her order, Cassie (she uses ‚ÄòCassie‚Äô in casual settings, and I allow myself this familiarity given how much I have observed her these past weeks) shifts her weight several times ‚Äì this may indicate she is anxious.  She pulls her phone from her back left pocket (pants: black denim, phone color: lemongrass, phone model: Google Pixel 7).  The information on the screen is pertinent.  I do not try to ascertain it via digital means ‚Äì I have yet to encounter a hacker whose skills rival the Basilisk‚Äôs or mine, and there are exploits that would allow Us access, but these do not come without risk of detection when dealing with an adept and careful target like Cassie.  From where I have positioned myself behind her against the wall near the counter, I am able to take a photo with my own phone without anyone observing.  This non-digital approach creates some risk as well, but such less-invasive strategies cannot be traced and are generally not subject to retroactive discovery.*

*She seems lost in thought and does not notice my intrusion.  Nor does she notice she has dropped the light jacket (fabric: denim, color: faded black) that had been draped around her messenger bag.  She often carries this jacket even if weather does not demand its necessity.  A totem, perhaps ‚Äì I am certain she will be displeased if it is lost.  I instinctively pick it up, but informing her will create unnecessary interaction, so I stow it in my backpack, undetected.*

*Just then, the barista calls my ‚Äòname,‚Äô and I brush past Cassie to obtain my coffee ‚Äì she has a slight citrus scent that stands out even amid the overwhelming aroma of espresso.  She reflexively glances at me momentarily, and though it may be unwise, I allow my gaze to linger briefly on her eyes since this is the most proximal I have been to her yet ‚Äì they are technically categorized as green, though I now realize this one-dimensional descriptor does not accurately capture their depth.  They are deep olive on the outside with shades of gold feathering out from the iris.  They generate a mental association with fire despite sharing little of its color profile.*

*I control this line of thought.  It is not relevant to my current purpose.*

*I step outside of the shop before looking at the photo of her screen.  She has received a text message from Ethan Patricht.  I cannot see what it says in its locked-screen mode, but I strongly suspect it will be a response to her request to meet.  Much hinges on the outcome of this meeting.*

*The Basilisk does not need to tell me to stay close.*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I skulk against the wall like everyone else here ‚Äì busying myself with my phone, perusing headlines about more weird drone sightings in New Jersey, the gossip about celebrities I don‚Äôt care about, the latest news on Silicon Valley bigwigs I do.

I look back over my text thread with Ethan.  I‚Äôm surprised how nervous I am to see him.  Maybe throwing a hefty dose of caffeine on top of it all isn‚Äôt the best move, but fuck it.

‚ÄúCassie H.!‚Äù

There‚Äôs my cue.  I work my way through the students and tech employees, grabbing my order on the way out to my car ‚Äì four comically large drinks with my name written in hurried scribbles.

A question I get a lot is why I didn‚Äôt change my name like my mom did.  I mean, I get it ‚Äì it would definitely make things easier since there‚Äôs not a ton of people flaunting the last name Hawke in the Bay Area.  But I‚Äôm never going to change my name ‚Äì that‚Äôd be like ceding territory in a war.

I was only 19 years old when I left campus to cloister with my family amid headlines about the charges against my father, our name now synonymous with fraud and grift.  Prosecutors likened him to Bernie Madoff and Elizabeth Holmes.  He knew it was over long before I did, and he didn‚Äôt even make it to the verdict before leaving a short note for us to find ‚Äì ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt remember me like this.‚Äù  I swore to myself that someday I would do something important enough that would take our name back so that no one would remember him, remember us, like that.

Several years later, I‚Äôm on the verge of making good on that promise.  Which is why I told Ethan I needed him to meet me at the apartment my team and I have squeezed into for the past few years.  I‚Äôm going to ask for the one favor he won‚Äôt want to give me ‚Äì an introduction to Miles Tallis.  Earth-changing entrepreneur, owner of companies that are literally going to cure cancers and send us to Mars, genius of a generation, blah blah blah ‚Äì he of the great Tallisco Enterprises and the even greater Tallisco PR team that boasts of all the things he‚Äôs accomplished and especially all the things he hasn‚Äôt yet.  Success has a gravity, and like it or not, we‚Äôve all passed through Tallis‚Äôs personal event horizon.

Against all odds, I have something Tallis desperately needs.  And he may be the only one who‚Äôs got what I need to keep what I‚Äôve built alive.

This whole journey actually started with my dad.  One of my earliest memories is sitting on his lap, watching him slap the keys of his keyboard like they‚Äôd personally offended him as he worked on the Linux system he‚Äôd built himself.  The glow of the screen spilled over me like a spell.  At that same desk, he taught me the simple program everyone learns first:

	#include <iostream>

	int main( )  {
	     std::cout << ""Hello, world!"" << std::endl;
	     return 0;
	}

I wrote it, ran it, and out it came: Hello, world!  Only two words, but something cracked open for me.  The lines of code behind those words, these characters I could type ‚Äì they granted me access to magic.

I also have my father to thank for Ethan Patricht.  They were friends in college, and even before I declared CS as my major, he told Ethan that he would be my advisor (forget that undergrads don‚Äôt really have formal advisors).  I think Ethan was disappointed in me at first, and to be fair, with good reason.  I‚Äôd worked so hard to get into Stanford, and I was making up for lost time on the social front.  I had my first drink, my first hangover (never having tequila again), my first class where I got anything below an A, my first real boyfriend, my first everything.  That was my freshman year, and it was fucking great.

My father was charged in the winter quarter of my sophomore year.  And then he was gone.

My junior year, I almost dropped out ‚Äì it was all too much, but then I thought, I‚Äôm going to let the world define me by what happened to my dad?  Fuck that.  I went back, weathered the looks, the whispers, the full-on comments from idiotic frat boys who somehow thought it might be a good opening line.  I worked nonstop, searching for a way to make my mark.  Right before classes started back up, I read an article about the AI winter that had dried up research funding.  Most of my friends took it as a warning to pivot to different focuses, but I heard my dad‚Äôs voice in my head:

*Fear or far.*

Here was a hard problem.  Here was an opportunity.

I took six courses that quarter.  I failed them all because I didn‚Äôt turn in any of my problem sets and I didn‚Äôt even show up for the exams, but I sucked all the knowledge out of them that I needed to get started.  Three years later, there are four of us squeezed into this two-person apartment.  Tight quarters and an even tighter crew.

Quentin I‚Äôd met in CS freshman year ‚Äì he‚Äôd never coded in high school, so he was behind everyone else, but he used that as fuel.  His vibe equal parts easy sarcasm and fuck-you-if-you-think-I-can‚Äôt-do-this-better-than-you.  He was too proud to ask for help, but I offered to show him how to integrate C++ algorithms with his Python work since he was stuck. He bristled at first, but then he brought me a coffee from the CoHo and soon we were pulling all-nighters together in the stacks.  He was right btw ‚Äì he‚Äôs a better coder than all of us now.

Sarah was an upperclassman in my dorm my first year ‚Äì dual majors in Neurology and Stats.  She‚Äôd regularly crush me in Catan matches, but she‚Äôs the type that wants to coach her opponent because where‚Äôs the fun in beating someone who‚Äôs obviously way shittier than you?  We played every week that year, and our lifetime record is running about 55-45 in her favor (for now).

Ziggy.  Jesus, where the hell did I first meet Ziggy?  He feels like he‚Äôs just always been around.  The type of guy that when a stranger at a party is telling a story about someone they know inventing the Smoking Dragon (which involves a bong hit and a shotgunned beer, and just don‚Äôt ask), and you ask if that guy happens to be named Ziggy, and you both laugh because of course they‚Äôre talking about Ziggy, and of course you both know Ziggy.  He‚Äôs the dumbest smart person I know, and I love him for it.

This was my crew I assembled when I left school.  The next few years were clich√© Stanford dropout stuff ‚Äì we coded nonstop in our tiny apartment with the little money we had going to hard drives, monitors, caffeine, and those disgusting, amazing one-dollar tacos from Jack in the Box.  Now, it‚Äôs finally paying off.

I park in front of our apartment, and suddenly realize my jacket isn‚Äôt entangled with my bag like it usually is.  I scour through the shit that‚Äôs all over the passenger side of my car, but nothing.  Fuck.  That‚Äôs one of the only things I‚Äôve kept of my dad‚Äôs, and it‚Äôs sort of my lucky charm, my socially acceptable comfort blanket.  It‚Äôs not a sign that things are going to go sideways with Ethan, I tell myself.  No time for this right now ‚Äì I shake it off and focus on the task at hand, heading in my building.

I push our door open with my shoulder, jamming the coffee carrier in Sarah‚Äôs hand because she‚Äôs closest.

‚ÄúThree absurdly large vanilla lattes to go.  Emphasis on ‚Äòto go.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúOh thanks ‚Äì you shouldn‚Äôt have.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo I mean, we were all supposed to have left the apartment by this time, so it was likely to be a waste of money.‚Äù  I give Sarah a look ‚Äì she can‚Äôt be serious.  These three have never been on time for anything.  She‚Äôs already switched into latte-distribution mode.

Ziggy is waxing poetic about his new-ish ‚Äògirlfriend,‚Äô and Quentin absentmindedly nods despite the fact he‚Äôs clearly just actively coding something  ‚Äì it truly is a miracle Ziggy‚Äôs found anyone willing to sleep with him, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the rest of us want to hear about it.  Ziggy takes a big swig of his latte and burns his tongue, which shuts him up for just a moment.  I seize this rare opportunity:

‚ÄúI love you all, but please get the fuck out of here.  Like immediately.  You guys are always late, Ethan‚Äôs always early ‚Äì wonderful combo.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoing, going,‚Äù Quentin promises without actually moving an inch.  ‚ÄúBy the by, Sully‚Äôs had a few processing spikes today I haven‚Äôt dug into yet, so not sure what that‚Äôs about.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat, we‚Äôll check it out later ‚Äì out now.‚Äù

‚ÄúBooted from our own abode, simply because we‚Äôre social miscreants,‚Äù Quentin faux-moans.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still typing, Q.‚Äù  He pouts, but shuts his laptop.

‚ÄúHer conversation will be more effective in a one-on-one setting,‚Äù Sarah says ‚Äì she‚Äôs never been great at picking up on sarcasm, no matter that it‚Äôs the lodestone of Quentin‚Äôs personality.

‚ÄúAnyone needs me, I‚Äôll be fucking up some 12-year-olds at DDR.‚Äù  And Quentin‚Äôs out the door ‚Äì one down.

Sarah puts in earbuds, shuffling out without so much as a goodbye ‚Äì two.

‚ÄúZiggy!‚Äù

‚ÄúYep!  Just need to put on some cologne so I smell nice.‚Äù  Ziggy‚Äôs subtle way of reminding me he‚Äôs going to see his girlfriend.  ‚ÄúFor Anna, you know.‚Äù  And there‚Äôs his not-so-subtle way.  ‚ÄúAlso,‚Äù he rattles on without missing a beat as he applies way too much of a cologne that‚Äôs way too much already, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre having someone over here, then I definitely get to have Anna over.‚Äù

‚ÄúZiggy, this isn‚Äôt like I‚Äôm having a friend over to hang.  He has to be here to see Sully.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah I know, and I want to show her Sully too ‚Äì it‚Äôs impressive.  And I want to, you know, like, impress her.‚Äù

‚ÄúRules haven‚Äôt changed ‚Äì no friends, family, lovers, enemies or otherwise are allowed over.‚Äù  I pause for a beat, ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt talked to her about Sully, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way!‚Äù  My Ziggy-bullshit detector is riding around 65% on that one, but this interrogation will have to wait.  I‚Äôm dragging Ziggy to the door when there‚Äôs a knock.

Ziggy opens the door, revealing Ethan.  Trim, quietly confident ‚Äì the professor all my friends had a crush on. I get it ‚Äì he's got boyishly handsome look despite the fact that his hair went grey years ago.  Even that suits him with his thick wavy hair framing his long face and trademark smirk.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm Ziggy!‚Äù Ziggy jams his hand into Ethan‚Äôs.

‚ÄúSomething smells nice,‚Äù Ethan says, his delivery dry enough that if you didn‚Äôt know him, you‚Äôd think it was a compliment. 

‚ÄúWhy thank you, fine sir,‚Äù Ziggy says with a little bow.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt encourage him.‚Äù

Ziggy leaves, and I take a quick breath, mentally resetting gears.

‚ÄúHi.  Sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a bit, Cass.  Cagey text.  Meeting at you and your boyfriend‚Äôs apartment?‚Äù  ‚ÄòBoyfriend‚Äô is the question part of that line.

‚ÄúJesus ‚Äì Ziggy?  No, he‚Äôs a roommate.  Part of my team.‚Äù

He looks around the place and, to his credit, restrains himself from any comments about the, let‚Äôs call it ‚Äòcluttered,‚Äô aesthetics of my apartment ‚Äì I can see it in his eyebrow raise, but points for not grinding me on it.

I reach up to give him a hug, letting myself take a moment before what comes next. ""It has been a minute indeed. My fault ‚Äì been caught up in stuff.""

‚ÄúHeavy workload this quarter, I‚Äôm sure.  Oh wait.‚Äù  He gives me a wry smile.

‚ÄúHa.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, you‚Äôve captured my curiosity ‚Äì what couldn‚Äôt we talk about on the phone?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, kinda can‚Äôt talk about it even *around* phones.‚Äù  

I point out the Faraday cage on the table ‚Äì it already holds mine.

‚ÄúThat really necessary?  I promise you there is no way someone is tapping my cell.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know ‚Äì indulge my paranoia.  I learned it from the best.‚Äù	

He clearly doesn‚Äôt like it, but he puts his phone in the box anyway.

‚ÄúOkay, you want feedback on something you‚Äôre working up?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot exactly.  I mean, yeah I‚Äôll show you what we‚Äôre working on, but we‚Äôre way past the feedback stage.  I need you to connect me with Miles Tallis.  What we‚Äôve got ‚Äì he‚Äôs going to want it.‚Äù

I push my computer toward him, my white paper up on the screen.  He reads ‚Äì first curious, then intense.  He finishes and draws a deep breath.

At first I mistake the look in his eyes for wonder.  Then I realize ‚Äì he‚Äôs scared.

#####Agency for Repression of Catastrophic Knowledge ‚Äì Special Memorandum

**11 October 2024**

*Memo prepared for Director of ARCK ‚Äì not for dissemination outside this agency.*

&nbsp;



**Barcelona Homicides: Suspected Link to Invisible Hands Campaign** (TS//NF)

&nbsp;



On 04 October 2024 at 23:31 local time, analog security footage captured a slender, muscular male entering the hallway of an apartment building in the Raval district of Barcelona.  A hat obscures his face, but observable features align with the individual previously flagged in *Netherlands Semiconductor Supply Chain Disruption Memo v2.3*.

He props up his phone on a tripod and places a marker on the ground.  Seemingly receiving instructions via earpiece, he uses a pen to make five marks on the hallway wall, each several feet apart.

He removes a plastic ghost gun from his backpack, steps back to the floor marker, then aims at the leftmost wall mark.  He fires, quickly re-aiming and firing again at each mark.  A weak cry is barely audible through the wall.  He aims again at the third mark, adjusts slightly and fires once more.  Silence follows.

He seals the gun in a small box, enters a code on a keypad, and a puff of smoke emits.  He collects his gear and exits.  The operation is over in under two minutes.

The victims inside the apartment were founders of a startup previously flagged under Poison Apple surveillance protocols.  Modus operandi matches the murder of a contractor on a classified government AWS assignment in Seattle, WA related to Poison Orange technology (see *AWS Contractor Homicide Memo v1.4*).

As such, we have high confidence this incident is connected to the suspected ongoing Invisible Hands Campaign.

While the goals and actors behind IHC remain unclear, operational patterning aligns with international events detailed in:
&nbsp;

- *Eastern Seaboard UAP Memo 3.1*
- *Maanshan Power Plant Malware Attack Memo v2.4*
- *South Dakota Special Election Interference Memo v1.2*
&nbsp;

See *IHC Memo v21.1* for full threat analysis.  

Dissemination outside this agency not advised without specific theories and directives.  Recommendation subject to revision pending further evaluation.

*It is not readily apparent by simply looking at Cassandra Hawke that she is a dangerous person, potentially to all of humanity.*

*She steps forward to make her purchase (high probability of order details: coffee, size large; sugar, yes; cream, no; three vanilla lattes, size large).  The Basilisk asks many things of me, but today‚Äôs tasks will be among the most crucial.  Given His hesitancy to use Our usual hacking methods, He has been checking in regularly, asking for many details ‚Äì some obviously pertinent: who she is in communication with via non-digital methods, her location on the occasions where she goes on hikes without her phone or other electronic devices.  Others have more opaque import: a description of her mannerisms while deep in thought (covers mouth with left hand, taps right foot repeatedly), how much of her pastry she tends to eat (approximately 75%-95%).  This is not unusual with the Basilisk.  He sees the interconnected nature of things more than I ever could.  There are limitations to even a mind as optimally tuned as my own.*

*He sometimes requires tasks of me that feel strange in the moment but which I have long since ceased in questioning.  Often their relevance presents itself later, like the assembling of a puzzle I did not even realize I was putting together.  Other times, I am left to wonder if their value never materialized or if they are part of something I may only understand far in the future.*

*This morning, He had me utilize Our 3D printer to generate one of the standard kits.  He instructed me to purchase a burner phone.  He also told me to spend 30 minutes going over the Wikipedia page about Auguste Rodin.  I completed all requests.  Learning about Rodin was by far my most interesting task this week, though I do not understand why He would want me spending this much time familiarizing myself with his works and biography.  When I have recreational time, I will spend some of it learning more about Rodin ‚Äì perhaps I will see if there is a convenient time to view his works in person.  I think this would be a rewarding excursion.*

*I am less enthusiastic about being required to carry a kit.  It feels like an unnecessary escalation in this instance, but He must be aware of something He has not yet disclosed.*

*I step forward to the cashier and exchange cash for my coffee order (size: small; sugar: no; cream: no) ‚Äì I can tell by her reaction that physical currency payments are an oddity, but any cursory attention this attracts is far offset by the lack of tracking that would accompany digital payment methods.*

*As she awaits her order, Cassie (she uses ‚ÄòCassie‚Äô in casual settings, and I allow myself this familiarity given how much I have observed her these past weeks) shifts her weight several times ‚Äì this may indicate she is anxious.  She pulls her phone from her back left pocket (pants: black denim, phone color: lemongrass, phone model: Google Pixel 7).  The information on the screen is pertinent.  I do not try to ascertain it via digital means ‚Äì I have yet to encounter a hacker whose skills rival the Basilisk‚Äôs or mine, and there are exploits that would allow Us access, but these do not come without risk of detection when dealing with an adept and careful target like Cassie.  From where I have positioned myself behind her against the wall near the counter, I am able to take a photo with my own phone without anyone observing.  This non-digital approach creates some risk as well, but such less-invasive strategies cannot be traced and are generally not subject to retroactive discovery.*

*She seems lost in thought and does not notice my intrusion.  Nor does she notice she has dropped the light jacket (fabric: denim, color: faded black) that had been draped around her messenger bag.  She often carries this jacket even if weather does not demand its necessity.  A totem, perhaps ‚Äì I am certain she will be displeased if it is lost.  I instinctively pick it up, but informing her will create unnecessary interaction, so I stow it in my backpack, undetected.*

*Just then, the barista calls my ‚Äòname,‚Äô and I brush past Cassie to obtain my coffee ‚Äì she has a slight citrus scent that stands out even amid the overwhelming aroma of espresso.  She reflexively glances at me momentarily, and though it may be unwise, I allow my gaze to linger briefly on her eyes since this is the most proximal I have been to her yet ‚Äì they are technically categorized as green, though I now realize this one-dimensional descriptor does not accurately capture their depth.  They are deep olive on the outside with shades of gold feathering out from the iris.  They generate a mental association with fire despite sharing little of its color profile.*

*I control this line of thought.  It is not relevant to my current purpose.*

*I step outside of the shop before looking at the photo of her screen.  She has received a text message from Ethan Patricht.  I cannot see what it says in its locked-screen mode, but I strongly suspect it will be a response to her request to meet.  Much hinges on the outcome of this meeting.*

*The Basilisk does not need to tell me to stay close.*

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

I skulk against the wall like everyone else here ‚Äì busying myself with my phone, perusing headlines about more weird drone sightings in New Jersey, the gossip about celebrities I don‚Äôt care about, the latest news on Silicon Valley bigwigs I do.

I look back over my text thread with Ethan.  I‚Äôm surprised how nervous I am to see him.  Maybe throwing a hefty dose of caffeine on top of it all isn‚Äôt the best move, but fuck it.

‚ÄúCassie H.!‚Äù

There‚Äôs my cue.  I work my way through the students and tech employees, grabbing my order on the way out to my car ‚Äì four comically large drinks with my name written in hurried scribbles.

A question I get a lot is why I didn‚Äôt change my name like my mom did.  I mean, I get it ‚Äì it would definitely make things easier since there‚Äôs not a ton of people flaunting the last name Hawke in the Bay Area.  But I‚Äôm never going to change my name ‚Äì that‚Äôd be like ceding territory in a war.

I was only 19 years old when I left campus to cloister with my family amid headlines about the charges against my father, our name now synonymous with fraud and grift.  Prosecutors likened him to Bernie Madoff and Elizabeth Holmes.  He knew it was over long before I did, and he didn‚Äôt even make it to the verdict before leaving a short note for us to find ‚Äì ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt remember me like this.‚Äù  I swore to myself that someday I would do something important enough that would take our name back so that no one would remember him, remember us, like that.

Several years later, I‚Äôm on the verge of making good on that promise.  Which is why I told Ethan I needed him to meet me at the apartment my team and I have squeezed into for the past few years.  I‚Äôm going to ask for the one favor he won‚Äôt want to give me ‚Äì an introduction to Miles Tallis.  Earth-changing entrepreneur, owner of companies that are literally going to cure cancers and send us to Mars, genius of a generation, blah blah blah ‚Äì he of the great Tallisco Enterprises and the even greater Tallisco PR team that boasts of all the things he‚Äôs accomplished and especially all the things he hasn‚Äôt yet.  Success has a gravity, and like it or not, we‚Äôve all passed through Tallis‚Äôs personal event horizon.

Against all odds, I have something Tallis desperately needs.  And he may be the only one who‚Äôs got what I need to keep what I‚Äôve built alive.

This whole journey actually started with my dad.  One of my earliest memories is sitting on his lap, watching him slap the keys of his keyboard like they‚Äôd personally offended him as he worked on the Linux system he‚Äôd built himself.  The glow of the screen spilled over me like a spell.  At that same desk, he taught me the simple program everyone learns first:

	#include <iostream>

	int main( )  {
	     std::cout << ""Hello, world!"" << std::endl;
	     return 0;
	}

I wrote it, ran it, and out it came: Hello, world!  Only two words, but something cracked open for me.  The lines of code behind those words, these characters I could type ‚Äì they granted me access to magic.

I also have my father to thank for Ethan Patricht.  They were friends in college, and even before I declared CS as my major, he told Ethan that he would be my advisor (forget that undergrads don‚Äôt really have formal advisors).  I think Ethan was disappointed in me at first, and to be fair, with good reason.  I‚Äôd worked so hard to get into Stanford, and I was making up for lost time on the social front.  I had my first drink, my first hangover (never having tequila again), my first class where I got anything below an A, my first real boyfriend, my first everything.  That was my freshman year, and it was fucking great.

My father was charged in the winter quarter of my sophomore year.  And then he was gone.

My junior year, I almost dropped out ‚Äì it was all too much, but then I thought, I‚Äôm going to let the world define me by what happened to my dad?  Fuck that.  I went back, weathered the looks, the whispers, the full-on comments from idiotic frat boys who somehow thought it might be a good opening line.  I worked nonstop, searching for a way to make my mark.  Right before classes started back up, I read an article about the AI winter that had dried up research funding.  Most of my friends took it as a warning to pivot to different focuses, but I heard my dad‚Äôs voice in my head:

*Fear or far.*

Here was a hard problem.  Here was an opportunity.

I took six courses that quarter.  I failed them all because I didn‚Äôt turn in any of my problem sets and I didn‚Äôt even show up for the exams, but I sucked all the knowledge out of them that I needed to get started.  Three years later, there are four of us squeezed into this two-person apartment.  Tight quarters and an even tighter crew.

Quentin I‚Äôd met in CS freshman year ‚Äì he‚Äôd never coded in high school, so he was behind everyone else, but he used that as fuel.  His vibe equal parts easy sarcasm and fuck-you-if-you-think-I-can‚Äôt-do-this-better-than-you.  He was too proud to ask for help, but I offered to show him how to integrate C++ algorithms with his Python work since he was stuck. He bristled at first, but then he brought me a coffee from the CoHo and soon we were pulling all-nighters together in the stacks.  He was right btw ‚Äì he‚Äôs a better coder than all of us now.

Sarah was an upperclassman in my dorm my first year ‚Äì dual majors in Neurology and Stats.  She‚Äôd regularly crush me in Catan matches, but she‚Äôs the type that wants to coach her opponent because where‚Äôs the fun in beating someone who‚Äôs obviously way shittier than you?  We played every week that year, and our lifetime record is running about 55-45 in her favor (for now).

Ziggy.  Jesus, where the hell did I first meet Ziggy?  He feels like he‚Äôs just always been around.  The type of guy that when a stranger at a party is telling a story about someone they know inventing the Smoking Dragon (which involves a bong hit and a shotgunned beer, and just don‚Äôt ask), and you ask if that guy happens to be named Ziggy, and you both laugh because of course they‚Äôre talking about Ziggy, and of course you both know Ziggy.  He‚Äôs the dumbest smart person I know, and I love him for it.

This was my crew I assembled when I left school.  The next few years were clich√© Stanford dropout stuff ‚Äì we coded nonstop in our tiny apartment with the little money we had going to hard drives, monitors, caffeine, and those disgusting, amazing one-dollar tacos from Jack in the Box.  Now, it‚Äôs finally paying off.

I park in front of our apartment, and suddenly realize my jacket isn‚Äôt entangled with my bag like it usually is.  I scour through the shit that‚Äôs all over the passenger side of my car, but nothing.  Fuck.  That‚Äôs one of the only things I‚Äôve kept of my dad‚Äôs, and it‚Äôs sort of my lucky charm, my socially acceptable comfort blanket.  It‚Äôs not a sign that things are going to go sideways with Ethan, I tell myself.  No time for this right now ‚Äì I shake it off and focus on the task at hand, heading in my building.

I push our door open with my shoulder, jamming the coffee carrier in Sarah‚Äôs hand because she‚Äôs closest.

‚ÄúThree absurdly large vanilla lattes to go.  Emphasis on ‚Äòto go.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúOh thanks ‚Äì you shouldn‚Äôt have.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo I mean, we were all supposed to have left the apartment by this time, so it was likely to be a waste of money.‚Äù  I give Sarah a look ‚Äì she can‚Äôt be serious.  These three have never been on time for anything.  She‚Äôs already switched into latte-distribution mode.

Ziggy is waxing poetic about his new-ish ‚Äògirlfriend,‚Äô and Quentin absentmindedly nods despite the fact he‚Äôs clearly just actively coding something  ‚Äì it truly is a miracle Ziggy‚Äôs found anyone willing to sleep with him, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the rest of us want to hear about it.  Ziggy takes a big swig of his latte and burns his tongue, which shuts him up for just a moment.  I seize this rare opportunity:

‚ÄúI love you all, but please get the fuck out of here.  Like immediately.  You guys are always late, Ethan‚Äôs always early ‚Äì wonderful combo.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoing, going,‚Äù Quentin promises without actually moving an inch.  ‚ÄúBy the by, Sully‚Äôs had a few processing spikes today I haven‚Äôt dug into yet, so not sure what that‚Äôs about.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat, we‚Äôll check it out later ‚Äì out now.‚Äù

‚ÄúBooted from our own abode, simply because we‚Äôre social miscreants,‚Äù Quentin faux-moans.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still typing, Q.‚Äù  He pouts, but shuts his laptop.

‚ÄúHer conversation will be more effective in a one-on-one setting,‚Äù Sarah says ‚Äì she‚Äôs never been great at picking up on sarcasm, no matter that it‚Äôs the lodestone of Quentin‚Äôs personality.

‚ÄúAnyone needs me, I‚Äôll be fucking up some 12-year-olds at DDR.‚Äù  And Quentin‚Äôs out the door ‚Äì one down.

Sarah puts in earbuds, shuffling out without so much as a goodbye ‚Äì two.

‚ÄúZiggy!‚Äù

‚ÄúYep!  Just need to put on some cologne so I smell nice.‚Äù  Ziggy‚Äôs subtle way of reminding me he‚Äôs going to see his girlfriend.  ‚ÄúFor Anna, you know.‚Äù  And there‚Äôs his not-so-subtle way.  ‚ÄúAlso,‚Äù he rattles on without missing a beat as he applies way too much of a cologne that‚Äôs way too much already, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre having someone over here, then I definitely get to have Anna over.‚Äù

‚ÄúZiggy, this isn‚Äôt like I‚Äôm having a friend over to hang.  He has to be here to see Sully.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah I know, and I want to show her Sully too ‚Äì it‚Äôs impressive.  And I want to, you know, like, impress her.‚Äù

‚ÄúRules haven‚Äôt changed ‚Äì no friends, family, lovers, enemies or otherwise are allowed over.‚Äù  I pause for a beat, ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt talked to her about Sully, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way!‚Äù  My Ziggy-bullshit detector is riding around 65% on that one, but this interrogation will have to wait.  I‚Äôm dragging Ziggy to the door when there‚Äôs a knock.

Ziggy opens the door, revealing Ethan.  Trim, quietly confident ‚Äì the professor all my friends had a crush on. I get it ‚Äì he's got boyishly handsome look despite the fact that his hair went grey years ago.  Even that suits him with his thick wavy hair framing his long face and trademark smirk.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm Ziggy!‚Äù Ziggy jams his hand into Ethan‚Äôs.

‚ÄúSomething smells nice,‚Äù Ethan says, his delivery dry enough that if you didn‚Äôt know him, you‚Äôd think it was a compliment. 

‚ÄúWhy thank you, fine sir,‚Äù Ziggy says with a little bow.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt encourage him.‚Äù

Ziggy leaves, and I take a quick breath, mentally resetting gears.

‚ÄúHi.  Sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a bit, Cass.  Cagey text.  Meeting at you and your boyfriend‚Äôs apartment?‚Äù  ‚ÄòBoyfriend‚Äô is the question part of that line.

‚ÄúJesus ‚Äì Ziggy?  No, he‚Äôs a roommate.  Part of my team.‚Äù

He looks around the place and, to his credit, restrains himself from any comments about the, let‚Äôs call it ‚Äòcluttered,‚Äô aesthetics of my apartment ‚Äì I can see it in his eyebrow raise, but points for not grinding me on it.

I reach up to give him a hug, letting myself take a moment before what comes next. ""It has been a minute indeed. My fault ‚Äì been caught up in stuff.""

‚ÄúHeavy workload this quarter, I‚Äôm sure.  Oh wait.‚Äù  He gives me a wry smile.

‚ÄúHa.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, you‚Äôve captured my curiosity ‚Äì what couldn‚Äôt we talk about on the phone?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, kinda can‚Äôt talk about it even *around* phones.‚Äù  

I point out the Faraday cage on the table ‚Äì it already holds mine.

‚ÄúThat really necessary?  I promise you there is no way someone is tapping my cell.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know ‚Äì indulge my paranoia.  I learned it from the best.‚Äù	

He clearly doesn‚Äôt like it, but he puts his phone in the box anyway.

‚ÄúOkay, you want feedback on something you‚Äôre working up?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot exactly.  I mean, yeah I‚Äôll show you what we‚Äôre working on, but we‚Äôre way past the feedback stage.  I need you to connect me with Miles Tallis.  What we‚Äôve got ‚Äì he‚Äôs going to want it.‚Äù

I push my computer toward him, my white paper up on the screen.  He reads ‚Äì first curious, then intense.  He finishes and draws a deep breath.

At first I mistake the look in his eyes for wonder.  Then I realize ‚Äì he‚Äôs scared.

I stumbled on this idea recently and it *broke my brain*.

Imagine:

* A burger costs 38 minutes.
* A house? 17 years.
* No money, no banks‚Äîjust time, ticking away.

You‚Äôd work not for cash, but to *earn hours* to replace what you spend. Every decision would feel heavier.

Would you live frugally to survive longer‚Äîor spend freely to live fully, even if briefly?

I think it might have something to do with the coffee being brewed at 120¬∞C?! When it finally cooled down it was not the most pleasant tasting coffee ever. If felt a bit like the coffee equivalent of getting kicked in the mouth.

I looked up the machine, looks like a La Spaziale S40 suprema. I found the manual and jt seems to come preset at 120¬∞C and has a range of 105-120 for boiler temp. I know by the time water goes through the group head and becomes actual coffee in a cup it'll have cooled down a bit but this still seems insane to me, why brew so hot when the consensus is that 90-96¬∞C is typically ideal. Is this more common than I realise?

Any help is greatly appreciated.¬†[https://imgur.com/a/nuTPmon](https://imgur.com/a/nuTPmon)

a. currently a purple leaf plum is in the yard. it has been there for approx 7 years. it has extensive black knot. I'm not married to it, so with the fungus I am thinking it is not worth salvaging. does that sound agreeable?

b. I'd like to potentially replace it with another tree. there are a few factors that impact things. there is a downspout that runs approx 3-4 feet next to the spot the current tree is located. other utilities are further away. there is an existing flowerbed and rosebed that cannot be adversely impacted by a tree's presence. I'm in no rush so I'd rather have a good tree than a fast growing one. I'd love to have a big shade tree with as little negative impact on the flower beds as possible.  chatgpt recommended a kentucky coffeetree or black locust.  I saw a catalpa recently I liked but potentially is too dense and will give the roses issues?  any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

c.  as an side, I'd like it if I could put a fruit tree or two out back.  there is a large garden out there currently I'd like to keep but could scale down.  I've accepted it probably won't work.  if anyone has an idea I'm game though.",1,1752501292.0,marijuanaenthusiasts,0,1.0,False

1lzn08i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RefrigeratorSea487/comments/1lzn08i/how_we_surprised_our_best_friend_with_a_midnight/,How We Surprised Our Best Friend with a Midnight Birthday Bash at a Farmhouse,"Last month, we pulled off one of the most unforgettable surprises for our best friend, Arjun. His birthday was coming up, and we wanted to do something different, something that would really blow his mind. Every year, we either took him out to dinner or gathered at someone‚Äôs house for a small celebration. But this year, we wanted to create a memory that would stay with all of us forever.

That‚Äôs when the idea struck, why not plan a [**midnight birthday party**](https://www.dozzy.com/) near Hyderabad at a private farmhouse? It sounded perfect. Open space, cool breeze, no nosy neighbors, music, food, and freedom. But the most exciting part was that Arjun would have absolutely no clue. We decided to make it a complete surprise party. And believe me, the way we executed it made it feel like a scene straight out of a Bollywood movie.

https://preview.redd.it/2caxz7ethucf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb4d5d9c05a22cdf6d3668a31e747f1c75ccefb2

# The Planning Begins

We were a close group of seven friends, and all of us were in. The first task was to find a private farmhouse for a birthday party within one hour of Hyderabad. After searching online and checking a few properties, we found the [perfect spot](https://www.dozzy.com/). It had everything: an open lawn, private pool, BBQ area, a cozy indoor space, a good music system, and most importantly, complete privacy.

Once the farmhouse was booked, we formed a secret WhatsApp group (without Arjun of course). From cake and decorations to food and transport, everything was coordinated there. We even made a fake plan to throw him off something like ‚Äújust chilling at our place with pizza and a movie.‚Äù



# The Cover-Up Story

To make sure Arjun didn‚Äôt suspect a thing, we crafted a whole plan. On the day of his birthday (a Friday), we casually told him we were going for a long drive at night, just to ‚Äúget some fresh air‚Äù and maybe grab some food on the outskirts. He didn‚Äôt find it odd because we often did spontaneous night drives. But this time, the destination was very different.

We told him not to bring anything special, just come along in casuals. Our friend Aman took responsibility for picking up Arjun, while the rest of us reached the farmhouse in advance to decorate and prepare for the big surprise.



# Prepping the Farmhouse

We reached the farmhouse around 7:30 in the evening. The weather was perfect. The sun was setting, and there was a light breeze ideal for what we had planned. As soon as we got there, we got to work.

We put up fairy lights around the pool, hung balloons and banners, and placed the cake on a decorated table. We also arranged a small bonfire in the backyard. Soft music played in the background while some of us set up the BBQ grill and arranged snacks and drinks.

The farmhouse owner was kind enough to let us in early and even helped us set up a few things. The vibe was magical already, and we couldn‚Äôt wait to see Arjun‚Äôs reaction.



# The Journey with the Birthday Boy

Meanwhile, Aman picked up Arjun around 9 PM. As planned, he acted as if it was just a normal drive. He played chill music, cracked jokes, and didn‚Äôt let anything slip. Arjun was in a relaxed mood. He had no idea that the rest of us were waiting at a [decorated birthday](https://www.dozzy.com/explore-all-farmhouses-in-hyderabad) celebration at a farmhouse, just an hour away.

To make things even more believable, Aman pretended to take a ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù and said he wanted to check out a farmhouse nearby that he might rent for a weekend later. Arjun didn‚Äôt suspect anything and agreed to tag along.



# The Midnight Moment

At exactly 11:50 PM, Aman called us and said, ‚ÄúFive minutes away.‚Äù All lights were turned off at the farmhouse. The cake was ready. Everyone took their positions. The moment Arjun walked in through the gate, we shouted, ‚ÄúSURPRISE!‚Äù

He froze. For a moment, he couldn‚Äôt believe what was happening. His eyes widened as he looked around the lights came on, music played, and we were all there, grinning from ear to ear. He was speechless.

Then he laughed, shouted, and said, ‚ÄúYou guys are unbelievable!‚Äù



# Cake, Music, and Madness

As the clock struck 12, Arjun cut the cake, and we all sang like maniacs. There was chocolate everywhere (thanks to the cake smashing ritual), and soon we were dancing like there was no tomorrow.

The music system at the farmhouse was perfect. We created a birthday playlist with all his favorite songs from old-school Bollywood to [EDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music). The pool area turned into a mini dance floor. Some of us even jumped into the pool, clothes and all!

The BBQ was fired up with grilled paneer, mushrooms, and chicken wings. We sat around the bonfire sharing old memories, laughing over college stories, and sipping on chilled drinks. It truly felt like a [**friends reunion at a farmhouse**](https://www.dozzy.com/explore-all-farmhouses-in-hyderabad) rather than just a birthday celebration.



# A Night to Remember

After hours of dancing and feasting, we finally crashed on the lawn with cozy blankets and soft lights above us. It was 3 AM, but none of us wanted to sleep. The stars above, the cool night air, and the laughter it all felt so peaceful.

Arjun looked at each of us and said, ‚ÄúThis is the best birthday I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù

That one sentence made all the effort worth it.



# Morning After and Farmhouse Vibes

The next morning was just as beautiful. We woke up to birds chirping and the smell of fresh air. Some of us brewed coffee while others walked around the farmhouse. The view was green and calming.

We played a quick game of cricket, dipped our feet in the pool, and enjoyed a simple self made breakfast. No one was in a hurry to leave. It was one of those rare moments where time felt slow and comforting.

Before leaving, we clicked a group photo at the farmhouse entrance. That picture now hangs in Arjun‚Äôs living room framed as a memory of a night he‚Äôll never forget.



# Why a Farmhouse is Perfect for Surprise Parties

Planning a [**surprise party**](https://www.dozzy.com/explore-all-farmhouses-in-hyderabad) at a farmhouse turned out to be one of our best ideas. It gave us privacy, space, and a peaceful environment to celebrate without restrictions. There was no pressure of disturbing neighbors, no loud city noises, and most importantly, no curfews.

If you‚Äôre looking to celebrate a birthday in a unique and meaningful way, a **birthday celebration at a farmhouse** is the way to go. Whether it‚Äôs for a friend, partner, or even a family member, the experience is something no restaurant or club can match.



# Final Thoughts

Looking back, the whole experience felt like a dream. From the fake drive story to the surprise entry and the midnight dance party it all flowed so smoothly. More than just a birthday, it turned into a bonding moment for all of us. The kind of memory you remember 10 years down the line and still smile about.

So if you‚Äôre ever wondering how to surprise someone you love on their special day, take them out of the city, bring them to nature, and give them the gift of an experience. You don‚Äôt need a 5-star hotel or a massive budget. All you need is a bunch of crazy friends, [a beautiful private farmhouse](https://www.dozzy.com/explore-all-farmhouses-in-hyderabad) **for a birthday party**, and a little bit of planning.

Trust me, the smile on their face at midnight will make everything worth it.

For the longest time, the idea of being alone felt like a failure. My mind would race, filling the silence with a loop of anxieties:¬†Why am I by myself? Is something wrong with me?¬†It was a constant battle against a deeply ingrained fear that solitude meant loneliness. But after cycling through relationships where I felt more alone with someone than I ever did on my own, I realized the real battle wasn't against being alone‚Äîit was against my own perception of it.

The War Within: Why Solitude Can Feel Like a Threat

That feeling of panic when you're alone is real, and it often comes from a few places:

The Social Script:¬†We're taught from a young age that partnership is the ultimate goal. Being single, especially for a long time, can feel like you've fallen off the expected path. The outside world's judgment becomes your inner critic.

The Fear of Your Own Mind:¬†When you're alone, there are no distractions from your own thoughts. If you're prone to anxiety or self-criticism, solitude can feel like being locked in a room with your biggest bully. It‚Äôs easier to find a placeholder person than to face your own internal noise.

The Biological Pull:¬†Humans are wired for connection. Solitude can feel unnatural, triggering a primal sense of vulnerability. My mind interpreted a quiet Friday night as a threat, not an opportunity.

The Turning Point: Loneliness in a Crowded Room

The biggest shift happened when I was in a relationship where I felt completely invisible. I was there to celebrate their wins, support them through their struggles, and listen to their day, but my own life went unnoticed. My achievements were met with indifference, and my bad days were a burden.

That experience was profoundly isolating. I learned that¬†nothing feels lonelier than being with someone who makes you feel alone.¬†It was an exhausting, one-sided performance that drained my energy and chipped away at my self-worth.

Leaving that situation was terrifying, but it was also the first step toward peace. I decided I would rather be truly alone and build myself up than be with someone and feel constantly torn down.

Reclaiming Solitude: How I Learned to Embrace Being Alone

It wasn't an overnight fix. It was a conscious, deliberate process of retraining my brain. Here‚Äôs what worked for me:

Start Small:¬†I didn't jump into a silent retreat. I started by taking myself out for coffee, going to a movie by myself, or taking a walk without headphones. These small solo ""dates"" proved my anxiety wrong‚Äîthe world didn't end.

Fill the Space with Intention:¬†Instead of letting anxiety fill the silence, I filled it with things¬†I¬†loved. I picked up my guitar again, spent hours on the basketball court, and went on long hikes. Solitude became a space for passion, not panic.

Lean into the Discomfort:¬†When anxious thoughts came up, I didn‚Äôt push them away. I sat with them and asked:¬†What are you really afraid of?¬†Usually, the fear was based on outdated beliefs or social pressure, not my actual reality.

Celebrate Your Own Wins:¬†I started becoming the supportive partner I always wished I had. I would acknowledge my own hard work, treat myself after a success, and practice self-compassion on tough days. I became my own biggest cheerleader.

The Payoff: Finding Peace in My Own Company

Today, solitude is no longer a battleground. It's my sanctuary. It‚Äôs where I recharge, create, and connect with myself on a deeper level. The anxiety still whispers sometimes, but now I have the tools to quiet it.

By embracing alone time, I haven't just learned to survive without a partner‚ÄîI've learned to¬†thrive on my own terms.¬†I've built a life so fulfilling that I'm no longer afraid of being alone. The right person will be an addition to this life, not a distraction from the fear of it.

If you're fighting this battle, know this: It's better to be your own anchor than to be tied to someone who is weighing you down. Your own company is a gift, not a punishment.

TL;DR:¬†I used to fear being alone due to anxiety and social pressure. After being in a relationship where I felt invisible, I realized being truly alone was better than being lonely with someone. By intentionally embracing solitude through hobbies and self-compassion, I turned my fear into a source of strength and peace.

Leaving that situation was terrifying, but it was also the first step toward peace. I decided I would rather be truly alone and build myself up than be with someone and feel constantly torn down.

Reclaiming Solitude: How I Learned to Embrace Being Alone

It wasn't an overnight fix. It was a conscious, deliberate process of retraining my brain. Here‚Äôs what worked for me:

Start Small:¬†I didn't jump into a silent retreat. I started by taking myself out for coffee, going to a movie by myself, or taking a walk without headphones. These small solo ""dates"" proved my anxiety wrong‚Äîthe world didn't end.

Fill the Space with Intention:¬†Instead of letting anxiety fill the silence, I filled it with things¬†I¬†loved. I picked up my guitar again, spent hours on the basketball court, and went on long hikes. Solitude became a space for passion, not panic.

Lean into the Discomfort:¬†When anxious thoughts came up, I didn‚Äôt push them away. I sat with them and asked:¬†What are you really afraid of?¬†Usually, the fear was based on outdated beliefs or social pressure, not my actual reality.

Celebrate Your Own Wins:¬†I started becoming the supportive partner I always wished I had. I would acknowledge my own hard work, treat myself after a success, and practice self-compassion on tough days. I became my own biggest cheerleader.

The Payoff: Finding Peace in My Own Company

Today, solitude is no longer a battleground. It's my sanctuary. It‚Äôs where I recharge, create, and connect with myself on a deeper level. The anxiety still whispers sometimes, but now I have the tools to quiet it.

By embracing alone time, I haven't just learned to survive without a partner‚ÄîI've learned to¬†thrive on my own terms.¬†I've built a life so fulfilling that I'm no longer afraid of being alone. The right person will be an addition to this life, not a distraction from the fear of it.

If you're fighting this battle, know this: It's better to be your own anchor than to be tied to someone who is weighing you down. Your own company is a gift, not a punishment.

TL;DR:¬†I used to fear being alone due to anxiety and social pressure. After being in a relationship where I felt invisible, I realized being truly alone was better than being lonely with someone. By intentionally embracing solitude through hobbies and self-compassion, I turned my fear into a source of strength and peace.

1lzmysu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Buildwith_knowvation/comments/1lzmysu/how_to_balance_study_and_social_life_tips_from/,How to Balance Study and Social Life - Tips from Knowvation Students,"Hey reddit!

Ever be in the dilemma of whether to study or meet up with friends? Study vs. social life can be like walking on a tightrope, but hold on, it does not have to be so tough! We asked some students from Knowvation Learnings to give us their favorite secrets for maintaining a balanced life‚Äîand they did not disappoint!¬†

¬†1. Set Clear Priorities:

Step one to achieving a balanced life is understanding what matters. Make a list of what you want to achieve in academics and your social life. Rank them according to urgency and priority. As was succinctly stated by one Knowvation student:

\> ""When exams are near, I cut down on social time and focus on studying. After that, I reward myself with a weekend out!""



¬†2. Time Blocking:

Dedicate specific time slots for studying and socializing. For example, two hours of focused study followed by an hour of relaxation with friends. This way, you‚Äôre not constantly worrying about what you‚Äôre missing out on.

\> ‚ÄúI use a planner to block out study hours and social time. It keeps me guilt-free and productive!‚Äù



¬†3. Join Study Groups:

Why not do both? Learning with friends can be surprisingly effective if done correctly. Sharing concepts and solving problems together makes learning less stressful and more engaging.



4. Set Boundaries:

Sometimes, you have to say ""no."" Let your friends know when you're in study mode. Share openly about your plans so they know to respect your study time.

\> ""I inform my friends that weekdays are for grinding and weekends for relaxing!""



¬†5. Mindfully Take Breaks:

Party life isn't always a given. A friend over coffee or a brief catch-up might help revive your thinking. Make it brief but good.

\> ""A break with friends for a few minutes between study blocks keeps me fresh and less drained.""



¬†6. Make Technology Work For You:

Use applications such as Notion, Google Calendar, or any time management application to schedule both your social and study plans. This ensures nothing is forgotten.

\> ""Planning my week digitally makes it easy to fit both academics and socializing without stress.""



Balancing study and social life is all about being purposeful. Prioritize friends without sacrificing your academic objectives

3 months ago I was scrolling Instagram, saw some amazing AI art, and thought ""I wish I could do that."" Fast forward to today, I just launched [Baelys](http://baelys.co) - my first SaaS! üöÄ

The Journey:

Month 1: Learned Next.js from scratch (complete noob)
Month 2: Integrated 5 different AI APIs (my credit card cried)
Month 3: Built UI, fixed bugs, cried more, launched
What it does: AI-powered image editing with background removal, filters, artistic styles, and real-time editing. Credit-based system because I'm not made of money.

The ""handwritten"" part: I literally drew wireframes on paper because I didn't know Figma. My desk looked like a mad scientist's lab with sticky notes everywhere.

Tech stack: Next.js 14, Prisma, Stripe, various AI APIs

Current status: ‚úÖ MVP launched ‚úÖ Payments working ‚úÖ Users can edit images ‚ùå Still figuring out marketing

What I learned:

Building something is 10x harder than you think
Users break your app in ways you never imagined
Coffee consumption directly correlates with bug fixes
Would love feedback or just general commiseration about the side project life! If anyone wants to try it out, I'll give free credits for honest feedback.

TL;DR: Built an AI image editor, learned to code, lost sleep, gained coffee addiction, launched a thing.

1lzmwmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1lzmwmt/my_tinnitus_journey/,My Tinnitus Journey,"I first became aware that I had tinnitus while I was in law school in 1972.  On the way home from the law library, I was aware of a mild ringing in the background.  I went to the doctor and he told me it was tinnitus and little else.  The next time it affected me was when I was trying to get health insurance and was asked about it in an interview.  Frankly, I forgot I had it unless I listened for it.  It may cost me the underwriting.  In the early nineties, it got worse, and the doctor told me to wear hearing protection.  Since my pattern was that my ears rang when I went to bed after being in a noisy venue and did not when I got up the next day, I did not wear hearing protection, nor did I avoid loud venues.

Then everything crashed in 2001 when my tinnitus became loud and intrusive.  I had gone to a loud movie (Traffik) on a Friday and then a D1 basketball game on Saturday.  On Sunday, my ears hurt, and I had a loud ringing sound.  On Monday, I saw my doctor, expecting an ear infection and antibiotics.  He found nothing and referred me to an ENT (the worst doctor visit of my life.  She knew nothing about tinnitus).  I eventually flew to Atlanta and saw Dr. Stephen Nagler (who later became Chairman of the ATA Board), who started me on TRT.  I eventually habituated to the sound, which means I still hear it, but it rarely bothers me.  I was able to maintain my practice and eventually retire.

I have a few observations which may be helpful.  First, you cannot control tinnitus.  When I first got the intrusive kind, I did everything to make it better.  I stopped drinking alcohol and coffee.  I stopped eating spicy foods.  My quality of life plummeted, and the tinnitus didn't get any better.  So, at Dr. Nagler's suggestion, I reintroduced alcohol, coffee, and spicy foods.  The tinnitus didn't get markedly worse, and my life improved.  Once you realize that your options are limited, tinnitus will stop controlling you.

Second, minimize anxiety and depression stemming from any actions you've taken because it won't help.  Tinnitus isn't like a headache that will go away in an hour or two.  If you have a spike in volume, you are going to have to ride it out.  Blaming yourself or trying to find a cause for the spike is unproductive because it's usually impossible.  I can take a nap with the tinnitus at low volume and wake up with it screaming.  

Third, don't avoid medically necessary treatments or diagnostic procedures.  I avoided taking a statin for years, and when I took it, nothing changed.  I freaked out at MRIs after hearing from people how they ramped up their tinnitus.  I've had four or five MRIs.  Nothing permanent.  It's hard to get a handle on what meds to truly avoid.  I have had many different antibiotics, but I avoid some.  But stuff like Versed,  Propofol, and others, I've tolerated well.  I know if I have to have chemo in the future, I am going to have to suck it up and possibly live with a new normal.  

I hope there is a cure soon, but the 25 years I've had a harsh version of tinnitus, I am not aware of that happening.  I hope this long post helps some.  ",2,1752500995.0,tinnitus,0,1.0,False
1lzmwh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1lzmwh8/impressed_with_deebot_t80_omni_and_comparison_to/,Impressed with Deebot T80 Omni and comparison to Eufy E25,"I have been looking to purchase a new robot vacuum as the previous one I had was over 5 years old and was never great due to poor obstacle avoidance. I took some time and researched quite a bit and determined I wanted something with a roller mop (My downstairs is mostly tile, with a few low pile rugs) and something that has good ""value"".

  
After reading a ton of reviews and research, I decided either the Eufy E25 or the Ecovacs Deebot T80 Omni would be the best for my situation and ""value"", but was not sure which would be best so I ordered both. 

My personal bias was to like the Eufy more since I paid $200 less than the T80 Omni ($899 vs. $699), however, after extensive testing, even at a higher price tag, the T80 Omni won me over.

Let me preface this in saying, it seems everyones experience and homes are different, so a robot vacuum that works great for me and my situations might not work well at all for someone else.

For me and my house, the T80 Omni has been incredibly flawless. It mapped my whole downstairs perfectly the first try, the way it separated the different rooms was much better than the Eufy E25, and I even moved the base station at one point for which it recognized, re-found, and adjusted without any issues or needing a remap. 

I currently have the T80 Omni set to clean the main areas of my downstairs every other day with a full clean once per week. It has been running this schedule flawlessly for the last 3 weeks and has not had a single issue getting stuck on any furniture, objects, or anything. The only thing I've done is empty the dirty water tank and put clean water + Tineco cleaning solution in the clean water tank.

This is incredibly impressive as I also have a small dog, a daughter, and a SO who both have very long hair that seems to shed more than my dog and has always been any issue for any robot or vacuum in general. 

I have not had any hair stuck on the side brush, vacuum brush, or roller brush.

It's been flawless and my floors have never been so clean, even dried coffee stains have been removed without issue.

Now, when comparing with the Eufy E25, it was night and day. The eufy for some reason could not detect my bar stools properly and would push them around, the hair would get caught in the spinning brushes, the vacuum brush, and worst of all, the roller brush. It also for some reason seemed to always suck up a piece of paper in the big roller brush, shred it to a million pieces, and make a huge mess of the floor and base station when it went back to ""clean"" it's roller brush. For the week I had it, I had to make multiple interventions to clean it out, get it unstuck, and it did not do any better job of cleaning the floors despite putting down A LOT more water when it mopped. The only benefit of the E25 is it finished the job quicker with its larger width roller brush, but I don't care if it takes a bit longer for the T80 since it's a robot and I'm not doing it.

Finally, I decided to return the E25 which I bought through Eufy's website and the process was not great. It was 2-3 business days between responses from their customer service, they did everything they could to avoid sending me a return label, and it's been 3 business days since it arrived back to them and I still don't have my refund.

For me, the T80 Omni is a far superior robot vacuum and I've been very pleased with it so far.",2,1752500982.0,RobotVacuums,2,1.0,False

And while she was the more jokish and playful type, I was more of an introvert and always preferred to stay quiet. On that day, I just got back from work, ready to surprise her with some flowers. Little did she know, it was one of those flowers that squirted water out. And while I did expect her to pull a prank, I didn't expect what would come up.

I go and walk over to the door to unlock it to enter the house. But when I did, something felt wrong. My girlfriend was known to be a little down and at least have some sound being heard from coming outside. So it was a bit weird not hearing anything. I just took it off assuming that she was asleep. But when I walked inside, I saw her laying on the floor covered in blood. Her face was pale, and there was a knife in her abdomen. I rushed over to her, struck her up in my arms, as tears came down my cheek. She spoke in a raspy voice, saying that she probably wouldn't make it, as the knife was too deep in her abdomen. I cried hopelessly and hopelessly, and even was about to call 911 when she burst out laughing. I was very confused. Wouldn't think anybody would laugh when they have a knife in there. She then exclaimed that it was all just a April Fool's prank. I was just standing there looking dumbfounded. As I tried to process everything, I realized she didn't die, but it was all just a prank.

After a minute of looking dumbfounded, I looked at her with a serious expression. I asked her, did he really have to do that? And she really didn't know what I meant, as she thought it was just a prank. I told her that she went too far, as you can't really just fake your death like that all for laughs and giggles. He shuffled it off like it was nothing, but I was genuinely pissed, as not only did she fake her own death, I pretty much almost believed it and almost called 9-1-1. Heck, by the end, before she left, I pretty much did believe that she was gonna die. After about 30 minutes of arguing, I just stormed out of my house and went to my parents, as they really couldn't look at her right now. After about a day of thinking, I called her to meet up at a coffee shop where we fortunately woke up. I said that one way we could give it another shot, but I had to think about it, as you can't just pull a prank like that.

Ah‚Ä¶ Ravnica.
What a curious little world‚Äî
A city so vast, its denizens believe the streets are the world. No horizon, no wilderness, just endless stone stacked atop ambition, paved with bureaucracy and bound by delusion.
I remember it well.
A guildpact‚Äîlaughable. A magic leash designed to keep ten yapping dogs from tearing each other apart, and instead, they built towers of lies and monuments to mediocrity. Ten guilds, each more insufferably self-righteous than the last.

The Azorius think law is order. I think order is power. And I know which one bends first.
The Selesnya preach unity. I watched them crumble like wet moss when the first real fire touched their roots.

The Izzet are sparks and sputters‚Äîchaotic gnats with grand delusions. Their inventions tick, tock, and explode on schedule. Useful once. Disposable always.

The Orzhov cling to their coins and chains, mistaking debt for dominion. They forget that true power needs no currency‚Äîit demands obedience.

The Golgari worship rot, like fools honoring the grave without understanding the sword that makes it.

Rakdos? Noise. Sharp, fleeting, and utterly beneath me.

Boros. Soldiers with more courage than cunning. Meat for wars they never understood.

The Simic... Ah, little fish who dared play god with gills and glands. How quaint. I am what they sought to create.

And the Gruul‚Äîsavage rebels burning ruins within a ruin. Hammers with no hands to guide them.

Even the Dimir, with all their secrets, never uncovered mine‚Äînot until I willed it so.

Ravnica is a plane bound by architecture and arrogance. A place where mortals thought they could build eternity with bricks and treaties. I walked among them, cloaked and coiled, watching as they praised their precious pact.

And then I broke it.
I broke everything.
Because unlike them, I am no servant of order, chaos, or balance.
I am Nicol Bolas.
And Ravnica is just another monument to the folly of forgetting who rules.
~~~~~~~~
Howdy ho folks, it's like for another length PbP post. Ever heard of Ravnica, that fancy big city in magic? 

Ever heard of Godbound, that cool forgotten Crawford game? Well let's slap em together. 

If it wasn't clear, I am looking to run a high-power high-stakes higher-everything game of Godbound and butchering it into a game that allows you to play as a nefarious Planeswalker, the biggest dicks in MtG. You'll build a color thematic character in the Godbound system and join a guild in Ravnica under the newly instated 'Whalefall' act. 

Nicol Bolas has laid claim to Ravnica, The God-Pharoh stating his ambition to rule the city-plane and take it for his own. The squabbling guilds know they can't hope to defeat him and so have turned to the Planeswalkers, an arguably neutral party who will be elevated in status in order to protect the plane. This is you and your compatriots, a third party group of incredibly powerful mages who will act as guild arbitrators, investigators, and ultimately, protectors. 

Now of course, no plan survives first contact with a literal dragon god so shenanigans ensue. Come be bribed by factions, summon armies from other worlds, fight weird monsters, argue with party members over loot, and enjoy a high fantasy power fantasy fantasy setting! (I couldnt fit more fantasy in there) 

Under the hood, I will elaborate more on Discord when players are chosen, will supply all books, and answer any questions. I understand this is a weird system in an unused setting mashed together in a fucked up sort of blender, so I expect hiccups and general tomfoolery. 

For the unfun stuff, I am EST time zone, usually write two to three paragraphs at a time. I am looking for 3 to 4 players that are capable of responding roughly every 36 hours and are interested in pushing along a story and game. I believe in power to the players so would also like to have people who are interested in running their own 'side scenes' such as Player 1 and Player 2 having a side episode of getting coffee while the main plot continues. These are 'non-canon' in the sense that I dont need to GM them and its instead to promote character interaction and growth. 

Yada yada more to be shown in DMs and discord. 


As for actual character creation, you will of course be playing a Planeswalker, a uniquely powerful mage able to tap into magicks from various other Planes and worlds. This can manifest in the summoning of monsters, casting powerful spells, and really anything we can come up with. 

Godbound simulates this very well by having you set up as a literal demi-god, something arguably on the level of a Planeswalker already. The abilities will be reflavored and changed to be more 'Magic' in nature, such as your water spell being a summoned Kraken and so on. I don't expect anyone to come to me with a fully made sheet so instead I'd like you to send me the following: 

# 1
Your rough Concept: Easily just a goal, or a theme. The more the better of course, but don't think you have to give me a 10 page backstory. This could be as simple as 'A fire mage who wants to write a book. Has a sad backstory'  or, 'Big sword dude, has a dad?'

I would like to note that Planeswalkers have something unique called a 'Spark' something that intrinsically makes them into who they are. This Spark is usually ignited due to trauma or stress, so consider why that is. 

Side-Bar, Godbound does not have Races. Feel free to play a human, minotaur, dragon, Duck, whatever. 

# 2
Your 3 choices of Mana: yes I know some purists will think 3color planeswalkers blow, but this is already weird so roll with it. For the newer MTG-ers, mana is divided into 5 colors and comes with its own affinities. You'll need to pick 3. These 3 will be where your power comes from, the thematic source of your power. Feel free to give me a 1 sentence explanation on why you've picked which color. 

White: Law, Order, Healing 
Blue: Knowledge, Control, Manipulation 
Black: Power, Ambition, Sacrifice
Red: Chaos, Destruction, Passion
Green: Growth, Nature's, Strength

# 3
Finally, I know this one is weird but, I will also ask you to go pick 3 magic cards from the Ravnica block. Link supplied below. Feel free to pick any 3 cards, any type, this is entirely for an idea I stole off Reddit to help build quests and plot hooks. Make sure you fix the link, didnt wanna get flagged. If it doesnt work, look up 'Scryfall, Ravnica Block Card Gallery' (sorry to mods, not tryna do weird link stuff I swear)

1lzmuay,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1lzmuay/all_alone/,All alone,"I am at a point in my life where I feel I have no friends left. My (former) best friend was quite controlling throughout our 20 year friendship. Looking back at it now it is hard to explain why I stayed friends with her for so long and why I always tried to keep her happy while ignoring my and everybody elses needs.

She used to decide who we would be friends and hang out with. Anytime I would make friends of my own she would get so jealous and insert herself in my plans with others or get angry at me if I was invited somewhere without her.

I stopped really making any meaningful connections with other people. So when our friend groups would dissolve because she had a fight with someone I would lose those friends too. Anytime she would have a falling out with any of our friends she would make me choose sides and I always chose hers. I felt like she would make my life hell if hadn‚Äòt. We were friends, classmates and neighbors, I couldn‚Äòt really escape her.

Of course it wasn‚Äòt all bad, obviously there were good times but those were only guaranteed if I did what she wanted me to. But when it was good it was great and when it was bad it was awful.

I say (former) because we are technically still friends. It is just that she keeps ghosting me regularly in the past two years. We text but she takes days even weeks to answer and I am starting to reach out less and less. And after everything I feel a sense of relief as if a huge weight has been lifted. Any time she reaches out I feel that I am tensing up and overthinking all of her words and why she‚Äòs taking so long to respond. It is doing me no good and I feel that I will be okay if this friendship comes to an end.

I am just upset at myself that I let myself get manipulated and into a position where she is my only friend and now that she ‚Äûdoesn‚Äòt need me‚Äú I‚Äòm left all alone. It‚Äòs been two years now and with work and everything else it has been so hard to even get out of the house let alone make any new friends.

Of course I have my family, my brothers and my husband, but I miss having a girl friend to chitchat with and relate to. Somebody to go shopping or get some coffee with. I had some friends from college but we live too far apart to see each other more often. It‚Äòs not like I am completely alone but it gets hard sometimes.

It‚Äòs not that I miss her I just miss having a friend. ",4,1752500826.0,lostafriend,4,1.0,False

1lzmst6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lzmst6/could_the_mr_coffee_sk12rb_coffee_maker_review/,Could the Mr. Coffee SK12-RB coffee maker review change your morning routine?,"The **Mr. Coffee SK12-RB** Simple Brew 12-Cup Coffee Maker has been a staple in my kitchen for a few weeks now, and I‚Äôve had quite the experience putting it through its paces. I‚Äôve brewed countless cups of coffee with this machine, testing its features, usability, and quirks both on hectic weekday mornings and lazy weekend brunches. 

**Design and Build Quality**

Let‚Äôs talk design: this coffee maker fits right into my minimalist kitchen setup with its clean white finish and classic style. Its dimensions (9.2""D x 12.3""W x 13.6""H) make it compact enough for smaller countertops, yet it‚Äôs large enough to house a 12-cup carafe ‚Äî perfect for when I have guests over. At 3.6 pounds, it‚Äôs lightweight but doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy. The dual water window is genius because I can eyeball the water level and avoid any unexpected spills or overflows. 

**Ease of Use**

One of the aspects I appreciate most is its ‚Äúkeep-it-simple‚Äù approach. Operating this machine is ridiculously straightforward. There aren‚Äôt any confusing menus or touchscreens ‚Äî just a good old-fashioned button interface that gets the job done. Plus, the manual operation mode gives it an old-school vibe. For someone like my mom, who‚Äôs not exactly tech-savvy, it‚Äôs a win. The reusable filter is both eco-friendly and wallet-friendly since I don‚Äôt have to keep buying disposable filters. Cleanup is also a breeze thanks to the Lift & Clean Filter Basket.

[Find the best price for Mr. Coffee SK12-RB on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b002yi49h6/)

**Performance and Brewing Quality**

Brewing is where this coffee maker truly shines. The Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause is the unexpected hero feature here. Whether I‚Äôm desperate for caffeine mid-cycle or an impatient guest is hovering nearby, it lets me pour a cup without waiting for the full pot. There haven‚Äôt been any drips or messes when the carafe is removed, which I consider a small but important win for my sanity. That said, the 110-volt system heats up fairly quickly and ensures rich-tasting coffee every time. It‚Äôs honestly surprising how consistent the flavor is.

**Comparing to Competitors**

While using this coffee maker, I couldn‚Äôt help but compare it to other budget-friendly drip coffee machines like the Black+Decker DLX1050B. Both are in a similar price category, but Mr. Coffee wins hands down when it comes to ease of use with its simpler operation and auto-pause feature. The Black+Decker does offer a programmable timer, which could be useful for early risers, but I prefer the control offered by Mr. Coffee‚Äôs manual setup. Another contender, the Hamilton Beach 46310, has a sleeker design and offers brew strength control but also comes at a slightly higher price point. If you‚Äôre hunting for straightforward functionality without frills, the Mr. Coffee SK12-RB holds its own.

**Key Benefits**

- Intuitive design with a classic touch
- Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause offers unmatched convenience
- Reusable filter saves money and reduces waste
- Compact and lightweight for smaller spaces  
- Straightforward setup ‚Äî ideal for all ages  

**Areas of Concern**

- Lack of programmable features might disappoint tech enthusiasts  
- The exterior plastic build, while fine for the price, doesn‚Äôt feel premium  
- No brew-strength customization option  

**User Experience Across Households**

I hosted a brunch last weekend and couldn‚Äôt resist showing off my ‚Äúnew baby.‚Äù My guests took turns praising its simplicity after brewing their cups. My niece, who only occasionally makes coffee, found the machine ridiculously easy to use, and my roommate loved how fast it brewed a full pot ‚Äî perfect for crunch-time mornings. The noise level is minimal, so it didn‚Äôt disrupt our conversations (or the neighbor‚Äôs baby!).

**Affordable Quality**

While I can‚Äôt put an exact price on it, this coffee maker offers serious value for money. Considering its durability, features, and ease of maintenance, it feels like a budget-friendly investment that‚Äôs worth every penny. You‚Äôre not paying for extra bells and whistles, but you‚Äôre getting reliability and functionality ‚Äî sometimes that‚Äôs all you need in a coffee maker.

1lzmrvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lzmrvf/morning_breath/,Morning Breath,"Not many people can truly say they‚Äôve flossed daily.



For thirty years, since I was seven and recovering from a bad case of gingivitis, I‚Äôve made sure to remove every dreg of food hiding in my gums. I brushed morning and night, with a quick clean midway through the day after lunch. When I smiled, everyone would comment on how white and perfect my teeth were.



I‚Äôm a dentist now, and I flash the same smile when I want to steer someone to my clinic. It could be a friend, whom I‚Äôm catching up with for coffee, or the barista who serves it to me. One compliment‚Äîthat‚Äôs all it takes. I hand them my card, and a week later, they‚Äôre at their first dentist visit in three years.



So, when one morning, I cracked a smile and my receptionist crinkled her nose, I knew something was wrong.



‚ÄúYour breath smells like something crawled in there and died‚Ä¶‚Äù



She wasn‚Äôt being rude, just stating it matter-of-factly. I licked the back of my hand, and once it dried, I smelled the patch of saliva. The smell was revolting‚Äîlike somebody had raided the fridge for cold chicken and gravy. I quickly gargled mint mouthwash before admitting my first patient of the day, thinking I‚Äôd solved the problem.



But the next morning, as I was halfway through my coffee, lifting the mug to my nose, I noticed the smell again, clinging to the rim. Rancid food and tangy, sour air‚Äîlike someone had pissed in a mop bucket.



I pulled aside my colleague, Walter, for a quick check-up on my lunch break. After a quick look, he shrugged. ‚ÄúNothing abnormal here.‚Äù But even still, his hand drifted toward his nose, though he was too polite to say anything.



As I left the office, I became acutely aware of every sensation in my mouth. My tongue felt thick, foreign, as if it didn't belong. As people walked by, I instinctively held my breath, afraid they might catch a whiff of whatever was clinging to me.



The next morning, I did my new routine. I licked the back of my hand, let it dry, and then heaved at the scent of it. The smell had progressed from rotten food to something‚Ä¶ chemical and earthy, like a smushed ant. I thought back to what the receptionist had told me‚Äîthat it smelled like something had crawled in there and died.



They do say you swallow a certain number of bugs or spiders a year, right? Or was that just a wives‚Äô tale? Whether it was true or not, it was the best assumption I had.



That night, I taped a selfie stick to the back of a chair and set it at the foot of my bed, angling it so when I attached my phone, it had a clear view of me sleeping. I had to know‚ÄîI had to know that the smell wasn‚Äôt me.



When I awoke the next morning, my shoddy duct-taping had caused the selfie stick to fall off its impromptu tripod. The stench was there again.



I plugged the camera into my computer and hit play. The footage started. I shifted around in bed, pulling the sheets on and off. Around 3:00 a.m., I stopped fidgeting and lay peacefully at the edge of the bed.



Suddenly, the sheets started moving again, but my body stayed still.



That‚Äôs when I noticed the hand.



A grey hand with nicotine-stained nails reached from under the bed, forcing itself through the small gap near the floor. Then another hand appeared, and with a grotesque wriggle, the figure slowly dragged itself out from under the bed. He sat up, his face inches from mine, just breathing heavily and staring.



When he seemed satisfied that I was asleep, he waved a hand in front of my face, his fingers brushing my eyelids, before crawling fully out from under the bed.



That‚Äôs when he saw the camera.



He froze, staring at it like prey caught in a predator's glare. Then, without warning, he lunged at it, knocking it to the floor with a violent crash. I heard his footsteps scrambling across the room, followed by the scrape of furniture being shifted. But there was one sound I didn‚Äôt hear‚Äîthe front door.



I never heard him leave.

# Chapter 32: Surprise Christmas Present

The early weeks of December vanished in a blur of last-minute assignments and festive anticipation, shrinking the semester's end into a rapid countdown. Soon, the university halls emptied as students departed for their hometowns across Japan, eager for family warmth and holiday traditions. Yet, in Okinawa, Christmas Eve settled with a different, softer rhythm, distinct from the snowy carols and bustling city lights elsewhere.

The soft hum of the jellyfish tank filled the air like a lullaby, casting ghostlike shadows across the floor. Kazuya moved with practiced grace between displays, pausing only to answer a child's question or smile politely at a curious parent. His work badge hung loosely from his neck, his sleeves rolled up, revealing the subtle tan lines on his forearms ‚Äî sun-kissed proof of mornings in the sea.

‚ÄúOver here, guys,‚Äù he said gently, guiding a family of four toward the shark tunnel. ‚ÄúIf you stay still, you can hear their gills filter the water.‚Äù

The child gasped. The parents exchanged a look of delight. Kazuya simply nodded and moved along, invisible again ‚Äî just the way he preferred it.

He didn‚Äôt hear the footsteps.

‚ÄúWorking on Christmas Eve?‚Äù

He turned.

She was standing just past the touch pool, backlit by the glow of the tanks. Elsa ‚Äî in civilian clothes this time ‚Äî holding a small paper bag.

‚ÄúMerry Christmas,‚Äù she said.

Kazuya blinked. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt expect to see you here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI figured.‚Äù She held out the bag. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just cake. Not even homemade. But still.‚Äù

Before he could respond, the aquarium manager tapped him on the shoulder. ‚ÄúKazuya, go take a break. You‚Äôve been going nonstop since three. Go enjoy your holiday. I‚Äôll cover for you.‚Äù

He hesitated. ‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo ‚Äòbut.‚Äô Go.‚Äù

Elsa smirked. ‚ÄúPermission granted. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

They walked along the outer promenade, the ocean visible in flickers between buildings. Most shops were closed, their windows glowing faintly with leftover fairy lights.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a milk tea stand down the road,‚Äù Kazuya offered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only one open. Unless you want canned coffee from the vending machine.‚Äù

Elsa raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúMilk tea it is. What a romantic holiday.‚Äù

Kazuya coughed. ‚ÄúI mean‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt mean it that way‚Äîjust that‚Äî‚Äù

She laughed. A genuine laugh, warm and brief and real.

He looked at her, almost startled. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve heard you laugh like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you were capable of being flustered. But you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not flustered.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bright red.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Äî‚Äù

Elsa just kept laughing, and for once, Kazuya let himself smile through the embarrassment.

They sat on a bench near the stand, two milk teas in hand, condensation collecting like dew. The air had cooled.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he said after a while, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre spending your holiday following me around?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I planned to stay. And when I realized you‚Äôd be here too‚Ä¶ it just felt right.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond right away.

She turned slightly. ‚ÄúSome things don‚Äôt need to be said out loud. You feel it or you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Kazuya sipped his drink, quiet.

*Is this what presence feels like? Not needing answers. Just being seen?*

While he stood to grab napkins from a nearby bin, Elsa unlocked her phone. The screen lit up her face as she typed:

Think I found him. ‚Äî Sent to: Mom.

She tucked the phone away before he returned.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said softly, ‚Äúoff campus and outside of class, you can just call me Elsa.‚Äù

Kazuya hesitated. ‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your professor right now.‚Äù

He nodded, almost imperceptibly. ‚ÄúThanks‚Ä¶ for remembering me.‚Äù

She tilted her head. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

‚ÄúMerry Christmas,‚Äù she added, almost as an afterthought.

Kazuya looked down at his wrist. A braided thread bracelet ‚Äî coral red and faded from saltwater ‚Äî hung loosely.

He slipped it off, held it out.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù

‚ÄúA thank-you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much. But it stayed with me when no one else did.‚Äù

She took it slowly, wordlessly. A small breath caught in her throat.

They watched the waves in silence.

Then, quietly:

‚ÄúYou wanna know why I really came here?‚Äù

Elsa looked at him, eyes narrowing.

Kazuya exhaled. ‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù

And for the first time that night, the past crept close enough to touch.

# Chapter 33: Soul Laid Bare

The breeze had shifted. What was earlier a salt-laced whisper from the ocean now felt heavier, laden with stillness. The promenade lights dimmed slightly, giving the air a warm, amber hush. Kazuya hadn‚Äôt spoken for minutes. He just stared at the sea like it held all the things he never got to say.

Elsa didn‚Äôt rush him. She sat beside him, legs crossed, milk tea in hand, sipping quietly, waiting‚Äînot as a professor, not as a friend. Just a human being willing to listen.

‚ÄúI used to be pathetic,‚Äù Kazuya finally said, voice low.

She turned her head, but said nothing.

‚ÄúI mean really pathetic. A loser. A simp. The kind of guy people joked about. I thought my worth depended on having a girlfriend. Like if someone chose me, then maybe I deserved to exist.‚Äù

He let the words settle into the silence.

‚ÄúI got a girlfriend. We broke up. I spiraled. I was desperate. So I downloaded this app‚Äîa rental girlfriend service.‚Äù

Elsa blinked but stayed silent, respectful.

Kazuya let out a bitter, hollow laugh. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt even trying to be funny. I was just... lonely. I hired someone to pretend. To smile. To act like she cared. And somewhere along the way, I started believing it.‚Äù

His jaw tensed.

‚ÄúWe pretended for my family. Then for my friends. Then, I guess, for ourselves. Or at least I did. She was kind, always professional. And I‚ÄîI just kept renting her. Not for the company. But because I didn‚Äôt want the story to end.‚Äù

He looked at his palms.

‚ÄúI fell in love with her. Even though I wasn‚Äôt supposed to.‚Äù

Elsa exhaled slowly, barely audible.

‚ÄúI saved her when she fell off a ferry,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúHelped her shoot a movie for her dying grandma. I crowdfunded it. Directed it. Got it shown in a theater. And when her grandmother passed, I held her while she cried. I was there. Every time. I gave her everything I had. Every yen. Every spare hour. Every part of myself.‚Äù

His voice stayed even, but the tears began to fall‚Äîslow, steady, unashamed.

‚ÄúShe wanted to be an actress. So I helped her chase it. Even when it meant pretending more. Even when I knew... I knew she might never love me back.‚Äù

Elsa looked away, her throat tightening.

‚ÄúIn the end, she rejected me. Softly. Kindly. Like she was sorry. And I tried to smile. I told her it was okay. But inside... I broke.‚Äù

His fingers dug into his thighs. ‚ÄúBecause I wasn‚Äôt just heartbroken. I realized I didn‚Äôt even know who I was outside of her.‚Äù

He wiped at his face, though more tears came.

‚ÄúI came here not to escape her. But to learn how to live without needing someone to make me feel like I mattered.‚Äù

Elsa moved without thinking. She reached out and pulled him into a tight, wordless hug.

Kazuya froze‚Äîjust for a second. Then something in him collapsed, and he leaned into her shoulder. He didn‚Äôt return the hug, but he didn‚Äôt pull away either.

Tears soaked her shirt.

Her arms didn‚Äôt tremble, but her mind raged.

*Who the hell did this to you?*

*What kind of girl lets someone give so much and then just walks away?*

*You gave her a heart and she didn‚Äôt even hold it. She just placed it down gently and walked.*

*You‚Äôre not weak. You‚Äôre gold. And I swear... I will never let anyone break you like that again.*

When Kazuya finally pulled away, he didn‚Äôt speak. His eyes were red. But clearer. Lighter.

Elsa smiled gently. ‚ÄúRemind me never to date you.‚Äù

He blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd probably buy me a house in Switzerland just so I could finish my thesis with a view.‚Äù

A small laugh escaped him, involuntary and surprised.

She raised her milk tea like a toast. ‚ÄúTo terrible ideas... and even better recoveries.‚Äù

He stood slowly, stretching, then bowed slightly.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFor listening. For... lifting it off me. Even just for tonight.‚Äù

Elsa stood as well. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt thank me for being human. That‚Äôs the bare minimum.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt hug again. There was no romantic fade-out. No swelling music. Just two people parting beneath the stars, a little more known.

# Chapter 34: Someone‚Äôs Back at Christmas Eve

The low hum of the DMM Kariyushi Aquarium after dark was comforting in a way Kazuya hadn‚Äôt expected. Most of the visitors had left, and the hush left behind made it easier to breathe. The water danced with blue reflections, casting soft patterns across the floor. Kazuya was in his element here‚Äîquiet, consistent, calming.

He helped a group of elementary students and their parents through the touch pool exhibit, explaining with soft confidence how stingrays preferred to glide than be touched, and how starfish breathed through their feet. They listened, wide-eyed. One child tugged on his sleeve and asked, ‚ÄúOnii-san, do you live here with the fishies?‚Äù

Kazuya laughed gently. ‚ÄúNot quite, but I think they‚Äôd let me crash here if I asked.‚Äù

The manager, an older man with a weathered face and a kind demeanor, clapped him on the back once the group had moved on. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the soul of the ocean, Kazuya. Some people perform. You belong.‚Äù

Kazuya smiled, nodding. But inside, something else stirred.

*Elsa‚Ä¶ thank you.*

She didn‚Äôt fix him. She didn‚Äôt pity him. She simply listened‚Äîand that was enough. That weight he had carried for so long, that unspeakable grief, was no longer eating him alive. He was lighter. Still scarred, still tired, but lighter.

**A few blocks away‚Ä¶**

Elsa walked down the sloped alley leading to the commercial district, her phone still glowing in her hand. She had texted her mother:

I think I‚Äôve found him.

Not ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù Not anything so dramatic. Just‚Äî*him*. The person she was meant to protect, or maybe understand. The one who made her want to feel without analyzing.

She was still thinking about his voice‚Äîlow, trembling, raw‚Äîand the way it felt to have his tears soak into her shoulder. It haunted her.

*How do you break someone like that and leave them still kind?*

She was halfway through another message when a voice interrupted her.

‚ÄúExcuse me, sorry‚Äîwould you know how to get to the DMM Aquarium?‚Äù

Elsa barely looked up, distracted. ‚ÄúJust follow this road to the left, go two blocks, take the stairs down‚Äîyou‚Äôll see the whale mural at the entrance.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù the woman said softly.

The voice made Elsa pause.

Something about it‚Äîlike velvet strained through regret. She looked up, but the woman had already started walking away. Her figure elegant, posture regal. She wore a warm beige coat and red scarf. Her hair was tied back in a low bun, neat and elegant. Her beauty was immediate, yet there was a sadness clinging to her that not even good posture could hide.

Elsa turned back to her phone‚Äîonly to hear the woman, under her breath:

‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôve forgiven me, Kazuya.‚Äù

Elsa‚Äôs breath caught.

She looked up sharply‚Äîbut the woman was gone.

Kazuya was wiping down the edge of the souvenir counter when the last lights dimmed and the closing chime played through the speakers. The manager approached with a clipboard.

‚ÄúAll good, Kazuya. You can clock out. Go celebrate Christmas somewhere.‚Äù

Kazuya gave a tired chuckle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just another day.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot for everyone.‚Äù

He was about to reply when a familiar voice sliced through the quiet.

‚ÄúKazuya-kun.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt turn.

His entire body froze.

His mind screamed, but his mouth moved on its own. ‚ÄúHow did you find me?‚Äù

The manager blinked. Then laughed. ‚ÄúAnother fan, huh? You really are a magnet. Aquarium‚Äôs full of women lately.‚Äù

Kazuya said nothing. His eyes still locked forward. He breathed through his nose. Controlled. Controlled.

‚ÄúCan we‚Ä¶ stay open a bit longer?‚Äù he asked quietly.

The manager, sensing something shift in the air, nodded. ‚ÄúTake your time, kid.‚Äù

The soft sound of heels echoed against the aquarium tiles. Slowly, he turned.

There she was.

Chizuru.

But not the girl in his memories. This version was more beautiful than he had dared remember. Eyes shimmering with unshed tears, but sharp as ever. A slight tremble in her lower lip. Her coat looked too expensive for Okinawa. Her scarf was the same shade of red she wore that day at the theater.

‚ÄúMerry Christmas,‚Äù she whispered.

Kazuya exhaled slowly. ‚ÄúYou look‚Ä¶‚Äù

He paused. His voice wasn‚Äôt angry. It was sad. Grounded.

‚Äú‚Ä¶like you‚Äôve been carrying something too.‚Äù

She stepped forward, then hesitated. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know if I should come. I didn‚Äôt think you'd even talk to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI almost didn‚Äôt,‚Äù he admitted.

She tried to smile, but it fell apart.

Kazuya walked toward her slowly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad at you anymore. I was. For a long time. But I‚Äôve learned that sometimes‚Ä¶ people leave not because they don‚Äôt care, but because they don‚Äôt know how to stay.‚Äù

Her shoulders shook.

He stood inches from her.

‚ÄúThank you for showing up. But I‚Äôm not the same Kazuya.‚Äù

They stood in silence.

He didn‚Äôt reach for her.

She didn‚Äôt ask him to.

1lzmqrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1lzmqrh/no_contact_support/,No Contact Support,"My BP is currently away on a trip and took the opportunity to have space and time apart. I asked if they wanted their trip to be No Contact (NC) to help them focus on just themselves, trying to have a nice time and focus on what they need.

BP said they felt NC was a good idea but softened it to ""we should try and see how long we can go"". They invited me to share what i thought was right or good for this space apart and I voiced, although I didn't want to be NC, I respect that the space and time apart should be good for us. I voiced that I struggle to be alone in our flat because I am so used to coming home to them that if they're not here I am not really sure what to do with myself.

BP decided because of this, NC for their trip was a good exercise for me to also take time to learn parts of myself or something new might come from this experience for me too.

I've had to focus on a rigid mindset of ""I cannot contact them"" this is no texts, calls, no messages over social media, interacting by liking or commenting with their posts if any were made and no sharing memes or funny reals with them. The things that would usually keep us feeling closer connected or ""together"".

I've wanted to reach out several times, I thought about transferring money to buy them coffee, they left one for me and I thought it would be sweet for us to have them 'alone together' which is something we do at home with activities but i stopped that thought process immediately - although i mean it sweetly doesn't mean it's good to do when we're trying to embrace space. 

I've wanted to sends so many messages from:
""how was your flight""
""how is your family""
""what adventure do you have planned for today""
""have you eaten anything delicious""
""tell me about the weather""
""have you taken many pictures yet, does the camera work okay""
""I heard our song out in the wild and i wanted to send you this video""
""I've been sleeping on your side of the bed because it smells like you""
""I miss you and want to hold you""
""I love you more than I can express in words and cannot wait to see you""

I've stopped myself every time, its hard.

I keep second guessing if deep down they want me to break NC to show I am all in and fighting for them and a connection with them because of the ""see how long we can go"" softener they put forward.

But im stuck firm on the respect part- they went out for space and time to be on their own, I don't want to break that or put any form of preassure on them but i am also struggling with not having my best friend to talk to.

I've seen so many safe friends these past 4/5 days, I've had anxiety spikes and stress cleaned our home. I've done things for myself as self care but I am so hard wired and thinking about BP all the time. I've posted on my own social media with some connection to what they have posted on theirs, it's indirect, not on their page, just my own story. I posted only from a place of longing and wanting to let them know they are on my mind, in my heart and I am waiting for their safe return or letting them know I am okay with ending NC in the gentlest way without directly talking. Even this feels like I have already broken NC and I won't post again like this because my heart aches for them and i feel guilty that we didn't think we didnt cover this type of communication (although it's not direct or even with them tagged it is with them in mind and that feels too close to trying to contact or reach them, because fundamentally it is).

Its entirely likely I am seeing what I want to see rather than what is there because my need is for connection i do not want to interfere or cause confusion or pain for my BP.

Their trip is only 9/10days and we're half way through. I know it should be good for us to complete the NC, its such a relatively short space of time. Still I ache for them and feel their absence so much I feel like I'm missing the best part of my life.

What are some things you have done or found helpful for keeping the NC or what did you or your BP appreciate that helped?",5,1752500577.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,6,0.86,False

1lzmo3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1lzmo3j/stopwatch_for_time_blindness_tip/,Stopwatch for Time Blindness Tip!,"I use timers and alarms all day. I have a physical timer that I flip over, my phone, the stove, and a Google home. This helps with all sorts of things BUT for certain tasks setting repeated timers becomes a distraction in itself. And when I have any unstructured time in my day, there's a good chance shit may go off the rails bc I checked my phone quickly and suddenly 45 mins have passed with me watching Instagram reels when I really need to be getting in the shower or prepping dinner. 

Enter the stop watch! 

So I actually love to cook. I use timers for pasta or if I'm roasting something but what if I'm boiling pasta AND sauteing chicken And making a sauce? Stopwatch! I am usually pretty intuitive in the kitchen, but if I get distracted (and I have a 3.5 yr old so I WILL get distracted), I may not remember how long that chicken has been sauteing on one side. Is this perfect? Nope! But is one side going to get burnt to a crisp bc my daughter NEEDED the potty right that second? Also nope!

I also use the stopwatch when I sit down with my coffee in the morning. Or any time I sit down really. Or when I do random things that I can't gauge how long it will take, like hanging a picture frame, deep cleaning the pantry, sorting my daughter's summer clothes, etc. Something about actually seeing the time tick by makes my brain actually live in real time. It's just a tiny little stopwatch in the corner of my phone's display so it doesn't feel intrusive. Sometimes I use a timer instead, depends on my mood/the task. But it's nice to have both in my arsenal!

1lzmn98,https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/1lzmn98/coffee_prince_and_the_change_of_time/,Coffee Prince and the change of time,"Hello everyone! I recently finished this Kdrama and want to share my thoughts and hopefully start a good discussion :) Please keep in mind that this will contain a discussion of the plot and therefore will include spoilers.

The 1st shop of the coffee Prince (Ïª§Ìîº ÌîÑÎ¶∞Ïä§ 1Ìò∏Ï†ê) aired from July to August 2007 and stars Gong Yoo an Yoon Eunhye as Choi Hangyeol and Go Eunchan as the leading couple. As someone born in the middle of the 90s and living through the 2000s, it's so weird to think that this drama to the new generation is what the 80s were to me. It was somewhat nostalgic but more so refreshing to watch a Kdrama which is almost 20 years old. The ""slow pacing"", no very obvious product placements and the use of cellphones that were only used for calling and writing SMS. These things made the experience of watching this drama very relaxing to me. My favourite part of the plot was honestly how the supporting plots actually supported the development of Hangyeols and Eunchans relationship. I found myself stopping episodes  mutlitiple times as I was either suffering emotionally with the characters in the first 10 episodes or cringing at how fast the main couples relationship developed in the last five episodes. But the ending was beautiful and I think they handled the toppic of marriage quite well (in regards to the obligatory wedding at the end of certain Kdramas). I actually enjoyed the pacing of this drama quite a alot. 

Of course there were some things that I disliked like the normalized misogynie. The moment the other coffee shop guys found out Go Eunchan is actually a girl they start to treat her differently, especially in regards to her needing to cleaning stuff. While the duty of cleaning the coffee shop toilet falls to her regardless of her sex (I understood this as they'd have a rotating schedule for the shop toilet) the moment Seonggi, one of the ""Princes"", finds out about Eunchan being a girl he demands that, in order for him to keep her secret, she has to clean his shared appartement. In one scene in the later episodes Eunchan says to Hangyeol (accroding to Netflix english subtitles): ""A woman receives energy from working in the kitchen"" Yeahh, this didn't sit right with me (This also expands on the character of Yoojoo and the topic of marriage and of being a housewife and mom). Then there was this really awful forcefull kiss in episode 10, which left me physically unwell...  
But overall I liked how the drama made Eunchan be determined on building something for herself without relying on a man and without falling into the modern ""girlboss""-trend, which wasn't yet a thing at the end of the 2000's, I think. 

How can we discuss this plot without adressing the elephant in the room? The ""almost gay relationship.""   
At times this was really hard to watch as I was literally suffering with Hangyeol and his inner turmoil of falling for a guy and possibly being gay in a probably lot more homophobe Korea than today. I dreaded the revelation of Eunchan being a girl and found myself wishing for her role to be an actual guy at times. I wouldn't consider this drama to be queerbaiting, as this was more of a huge miscommunication plotline or more so ""no communication"" because of desperation at first and later out of fear. It still leaves a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth that the drama conveys the message of ""It was okay to fall in love with a guys since he is actually a she"". The revelation of Eunchan being a girl was just aweful. I whish they had expanded more on the topic of Hangyeol comming to terms with his own sexuality. Then again for Coffee Prince being a 20 year old drama, I think the way this plot was handled was actually very progressive.  I'd love to hear other queer peoples opinion about this. 

The thing that actually shocked me the most was the prominent representatin of skinship and non sexual physical intimacy. I know that the majority of Kdrama lovers especially enjoy the handling of physically romantic relationships in comparison to western releases. But I feel like through out the years (and I think we see this in Kpop as well) it has become kind of sacrilegious for men and women to touch if not romantically involved. I enjoyed all the hugs, cuddling and playful banter between Eunchan and Hangyeol sooo so much! It looked so much more natural than the overproduced kisses from todays Kdramas. I think episode sixteens door/wall kiss catapulted itself into my top 5 drama kisses. And it's not just only the romantic physical contact but physical contact overall. Like the goodbye hugs from Harim and Minyeop before  Eunchan leaves for Italy and when I tell you, I was pleasently shocked to see hugs between a girl and boys. We don't see this type of friendly affection in newer Kdramas, do we or am I just watching the wrong Kdramas?   
This is the first older Kdrama I watched. The only others being Boys over Flowers and Dream High around 2011. I remember these two dramas being also more on the non touchy side. So was Coffee shop an exception? 

There are a lot more things to talk about but this were the most relevant topics in need of discussion for me. For summary:   
1) The slow down of time because of a small amount of technology and the pacing thorugh plotlines.  
2) The portrayal of female characters and their desires and the depiticion of normalized misogynistic views as a product of it's time.  
3) The use of a gay relationship as a plot device but also showcasing acceptance.  
4) The depiction of skinship and physical touch in romantic and non-romantic relationships alike.

Overall the drama felt very refreshing to me and I will be watching it again for its 20 year anniversary in two years. ",4,1752500329.0,KDRAMA,0,0.83,False

I am in my late twenties and have dealt with agoraphobia since I was in 8th grade. In 2021 I had a severe episode of dissociation while I was out studying at a coffee shop and that was the primary event that led to me struggling with this for so long. I have had trouble maintaining relationships due to my agoraphobia which leads to more depression due to being alone so often. Despite \~3 years of pushing to try and further my boundary of comfort, I have found little to no progress and as a result I now am incredibly isolated and lonely. I have had dates with people during this period due to dating apps and being open about my agoraphobia with those who I wanted to meet, but I get in my head and end up calling off seeing the person after hanging for a few times because I know it will inevitably end due to my agoraphobia. I have tried various medications and Lexapro worked for me back in 2016-2018, but then its efficacy waned until it didn't do much at all. I'm currently in a very bad headspace because of this and have a general hesitance (fear, if I'm being honest) about trying new meds because I worry they might worsen my symptoms and push me over the edge. I'm just wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience and tried medication(s) that ended up working for them and, if I'm being honest, I think I am just looking for some community in knowing that I might not be alone in my circumstances.

Now I‚Äôm on strattera and tenex, because stimulants have caused other issues like anxiety/insomnia I believe.

Anyways, I‚Äôve used coping skills my entire life to get by the bad sleep and non stop bouncing thoughts. Coffee was my go to, but I also isolated a lot because it was too much socially sometimes.

Now that I‚Äôm a dad of two, with a family, I‚Äôve learned very quickly those coping skills are worthless. So in the midst of massive change in life I‚Äôm also trying to cope to be there and present with my family. Needless to say it‚Äôs been overwhelming.

Seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on tenex to help with the anxiety, but wants me off coffee and back on a stimulant that we will monitor closely. Having mixed feelings on this just because of the long term effects and difficulty even getting the correct meds. Generic Ritalin was such a hassle to get and then they switched manufacturers who use different ingredients that did not help things.

I‚Äôve had bad insomnia since my second was born along with panic attacks before sleep because I worry about not sleeping. So I‚Äôm on low dose Seroquel for that and it‚Äôs been helping. It‚Äôs very hard for me to wind down from non ending stimulation / responsibility taking care of two kids. Even with help.

Anyways, it would be nice to hear some tips and things that have helped you if you‚Äôre in a similar situation. My job and family life have been suffering from all of this and each day it‚Äôs harder to hold it all together. Thank you.

1lzmjzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lzmjzf/aitah_for_losing_a_friend_to_a_toxic_guy_and_not/,AITAH for losing a friend to a toxic guy and not wanting her back in my life?,"Please excuse any mistakes, English is not my first language.

A few years ago, I had a very close friend ‚Äî let‚Äôs call her Anna. We attended the same university, had a lot of classes together, became fast friends, and eventually roommates.

One summer, Anna joined an internship program and came back full of new experiences. She told me about a guy she met there ‚Äî let‚Äôs call him Ben ‚Äî who started to show interest in her and eventually asked her out. She said she turned him down because although he seemed nice, she didn‚Äôt feel that kind of attraction, and she wasn‚Äôt interested in a long-distance relationship. Ben took it well, and they remained on good terms until the internship ended.

A few weeks into the new semester, Ben called to say he‚Äôd be in our city for work and asked Anna if she wanted to grab coffee. She said yes. It was just coffee, nothing more. But then he kept finding reasons to come to our city ‚Äî for ‚Äúwork‚Äù or other errands ‚Äî and every time he did, he asked to meet up. Eventually, these coffee meetings turned into dates.

Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Ben: he‚Äôs about 10 years older than us, in the same general field of study, but has neither a degree nor any other qualification. And not because he started late or had some valid reason. He‚Äôs one of those students who stay in the system by hopping between majors and exploiting loopholes. In the meantime, he built a network within the university and supported himself with small research assistant gigs and odd campus jobs.

Eventually, Anna said yes to dating him. She told me she was still unsure about the long-distance thing, but Ben was sweet and attentive and made her feel like the distance wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.

When I first met him, I instantly disliked him. From the very beginning, he was condescending and patronizing. Since we all studied similar subjects, within 30 minutes of meeting me, he was lecturing both Anna and me about how we should manage our time, prepare for our futures, and what the important life steps are. Normally, I‚Äôd just smile and nod, but the things he was saying were complete nonsense ‚Äî and the fact that a guy in his 30s, who still lived with his mother and had repeatedly dropped out of university, was trying to lecture me really tested my patience. I politely said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really see it that way,‚Äù and I saw his eyes flash. He clearly didn‚Äôt like being contradicted.

My unease only grew. Turns out, Ben had no job or reason to be in our city. He was coming down solely to see Anna and try to convince her that they had a future together. When I asked Anna if she didn‚Äôt feel misled by that, she said no ‚Äî it was romantic and showed how much he was willing to fight for them. I let it go.

But things started getting uncomfortable. Not because I had a problem with them as a couple (I had my own boyfriend at the time ‚Äî who also didn‚Äôt like Ben), but because Ben started doing things that were disruptive or even harmful ‚Äî to both Anna and me.

For example, during a critical week when we were working on a big assignment (Ben knew this), he showed up and stayed the whole weekend, expecting Anna to spend ‚Äúquality time‚Äù with him. He ate the meal I had prepped for myself so I could focus on work. He blared music or the TV while we were trying to study. Then, in the middle of exam season, he basically moved in with us. It became nearly impossible to study, rest, or even exist peacefully. I fought with him several times over the lack of respect for our space.

Anna didn‚Äôt pass a single exam that semester. She missed all of them because there was always something that ‚ÄúBen needed her for.‚Äù When I brought up my concerns, I could see that she *got it*. Her failure meant she couldn‚Äôt register for the next set of required classes, which delayed her graduation. She said she‚Äôd talk to Ben.

A week later, she told me Ben had found a job in our city, was switching to part-time studies, and they were moving in together.

I felt like Anna was in trouble and that I had to help her, but I knew confronting her directly would only push her further toward Ben. After she moved out, our friendship grew more distant. It took us three weeks to even schedule a coffee meetup. At that coffee, I told her I loved her and that while it was no secret I didn‚Äôt like Ben (and he didn‚Äôt like me, either), I didn‚Äôt want to lose her. I said she didn‚Äôt have to choose ‚Äî that our friendship could survive if we were both respectful. I promised to respect Ben as long as he did the same for me.

Anna opened up, said she missed me terribly, and promised to fight for our friendship.

But that didn‚Äôt happen.

Things only got worse. One day, Anna was very late for an important lab session. When we asked her what happened, she said she was coming from the hospital. She and Ben had a fight that morning. He got so angry that he punched the wall *right next to her head* and broke his hand.

We were all speechless, but she kept talking. She said she was *proud* of Ben for ‚Äúcontrolling his anger.‚Äù

I snapped.

‚ÄúControlling it? How is that controlling his anger?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI made him really mad, and he *wanted* to hit me, but instead, he hit the wall.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnna, do you hear yourself? Ben got so mad during an argument that his instinct was to hit *you* ‚Äî and you think it‚Äôs okay because he hit the wall instead? Why didn‚Äôt he just take a walk to cool off? Why was his first instinct to hurt you?‚Äù

She had no answer, and I could see that what I said didn‚Äôt sit well with her.

After that, our relationship deteriorated. I didn‚Äôt see her outside of shared classes. She stopped picking up my calls. Eventually, she didn‚Äôt call back. She read my messages but never replied. It really hurt. There were no signs of physical abuse and none of our mutual friends reported anything suspicious either.

Eventually, I gave up trying. When I went through a rough breakup myself, she didn‚Äôt reach out once. No message, no support. That was the final straw.

I graduated, got a job, met my now-husband, and Anna all but disappeared from my life ‚Äî even though we still live close to each other.

A few weeks ago, we ran into each other by chance. She smiled and greeted me loudly ‚Äî ‚ÄúHey, long time no see!‚Äù I smiled back but didn‚Äôt slow down, even though I saw she wanted to hug me.

‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm in a rush.‚Äù I really *was* in a rush ‚Äî but I also didn‚Äôt want to fake a friendly chat. I didn‚Äôt want to pretend everything was okay between us.

We hadn‚Äôt seen each other in years, and she never once reached out. I also found out that she told some of our mutual friends that we drifted apart because I became jealous of her and Ben after my breakup. That stung.

Even today, I believe Anna is still in a toxic relationship with Ben (yes, they‚Äôre still together), but I also believe that, for my own peace of mind, I had to distance myself from someone who consistently took from me and wasn‚Äôt there when I needed her.

1lzmhj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lzmhj7/explore_why_the_delonghi_dedica_maestro_plus/,Explore why the De'Longhi Dedica Maestro Plus espresso machine review excites coffee enthusiasts!,"Exploring the **De'Longhi EC950M Dedica Maestro Plus Espresso Machine** has been an intriguing experience. With its promise of barista-quality coffee and a sleek design, I was pretty eager to put this stainless steel machine to the test. It stands out as a compact, semi-automatic espresso machine, loaded with advanced features like the Auto LatteArt technology, customizable brewing settings, and quick heat-up capabilities.

**Compact Yet Stylish Design**  
The stainless steel body of this espresso machine instantly adds a touch of modernity to any kitchen. Its slim build‚Äîapproximately 13.62‚Äù deep and 8.15‚Äù wide‚Äîmeans it doesn‚Äôt hog all the counter space, which was a relief because I like to keep things tidy. Honestly, it‚Äôs an eye-catching addition among the more utilitarian gadgets in my collection. The professional-grade portafilter and tamper included were a nice surprise too. While the compact size is a selling point, I did notice that it slightly limits space for larger coffee cups, but that‚Äôs to be expected from a machine with this form factor.

**Performance Meets Versatility**  
What truly sold me on this De'Longhi espresso machine was the versatility it offers. From espresso to lattes and even cappuccinos, this machine gives me all the options I need. The 15-bar professional pump ensures consistent pressure, which is essential for pulling a quality shot. Using freshly ground coffee is a breeze, but my favorite part is the integration of preset brewing temperatures. I found the thermoblock system particularly efficient‚Äîhaving my coffee ready in just seconds is a lifesaver on rushed mornings.  

[Check De'Longhi EC950M Dedica Maestro Plus price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ct2pt244/)  

**Magic of the Auto Steam Wand**  
The Auto LatteArt steam wand worked like a dream. With three levels of milk texture and temperature options, I got perfect froth every time. Whether crafting latte art or a straight-up cappuccino for my friends, the machine delivered every time. During testing, I experimented with almond milk too, which produced surprisingly solid results, proving this machine‚Äôs adaptability to milk alternatives.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
This espresso machine is definitely user-friendly. Even with little espresso-making experience, the buttons are clear and highly responsive. The detachable water tank and drip tray simplify cleanup, which is a big relief for someone like me who shies away from high-maintenance appliances. That said, the frothing wand requires a quick wipe immediately after use; otherwise, dried milk build-up can be a pain to remove.

**Benefits**  
- The thermoblock system heats up in less than a minute.  
- Compact design takes up minimal counter space.  
- Wide adaptability for milk-based beverages and milk alternatives.  
- User-friendly interface suitable for both beginners and seasoned baristas.  
- Stainless steel finish adds durability and aesthetic appeal.

**Caveats**  
- Compact size limits compatibility with larger cups.  
- Maintenance of the frothing wand can be slightly tricky if neglected.  
- Slightly expensive upfront compared to basic espresso machines, but offers far more features.

**Other Options Worth Considering**  
Looking at peer products, I had a chance to compare this with the Breville Bambino and the Nespresso Essenza Mini. The Bambino is another compact machine but doesn‚Äôt have the automatic steam wand feature, which gives the De'Longhi an edge for milk-based drinks. On the other hand, the Essenza Mini is perfect for those who just want a simple pod-based machine, but it feels limited when compared to the range of fresh coffee options you get with this machine.  

What truly makes this espresso machine stand out is how customizable it is, while still being easier to master than professional-grade units like Breville‚Äôs higher-end models. That being said, the price does place it slightly above basic semi-automatic machines, arguably positioning it in a competitive mid-tier niche.

**Value Proposition**  
Considering the number of features packed into this petite espresso powerhouse, it feels like smart spending. While it isn‚Äôt the cheapest option on the market, the machine justifies its pricing by providing standout reliability and customization. Each cup of coffee it delivers feels like a step closer to coffee shop perfection. However, long-term use will truly determine whether the initial cost is totally justified.

Jul 14 2025

Rose Green was the notorious little vixen of the social circles, her red lips slightly upturned, her eyes captivating.

Henry Wilson, the most outstanding heir of the Wilson Family, was a high‚Äîand‚Äîmighty flower, abstinent and self‚Äîpossessed.

Nobody knew that these two polar opposites would be entangled in the backseat of a Maybach late at night, wildly entwined in the restroom of a charity gala, or with him pinning her against the floor‚Äîto‚Äîceiling windows of a private winery, kissing her.

After another encounter, the sound of running water came from the bathroom.

Rose leaned against the headboard and called her father, James Green.

""I can marry the dying crown prince of Seraphina to bring good fortune, but I have a condition...""

On the other end of the line was uncontainable joy:""Anything! As long as you're willing to marry, I'll agree to any condition!""

""I'll tell you when I get home."" Her voice was soft, but her eyes were cold.

Rose hung up, about to get dressed, when she caught sight of Henry's laptop lying nearby.

The DM interface was lit up, the latest message from a girl whose contact name was ""Ruby"".

„ÄêHenry, it's thundering, I'm so scared...„Äë

Rose's fingers trembled.

The bathroom door suddenly opened, and Henry walked out.

Water droplets slid down his collarbone, his shirt casually unbuttoned at the top two buttons, revealing a seductive laziness beneath his usual abstinence.

""Something came up at the company, I'll be going."" He picked up his coat, his voice still cold.

Rose's red lips curled slightly:""Something came up at the company, or are you going to see your precious love?""

Henry didn't quite hear:""What?""

""Nothing."" She got out of bed barefoot, her snow‚Äîwhite feet stepping on the soft carpet.

The man's eyes darkened slightly, his thumb caressing her swollen lips:""Be good, don't cause trouble.""

The moment the door closed, the smile on Rose's face vanished.

She hailed a car and followed him.

Half an hour later, the car stopped in front of a hotel. Rose, through the rain, saw Ruby Perry in a white dress running out of the hotel entrance.

Henry quickly stepped forward, taking off his suit jacket and draping it over her shoulders, then lifting her into his arms.

""It's cold outside, why didn't you wear a coat, hmm?""

His movements were so practiced, as if he had rehearsed them a thousand times.

Rose clutched the car door handle tightly, her nails digging deep into her palm.

She watched Henry carefully carry Ruby into the hotel, and for some reason, she suddenly remembered the first time she met him.

Back then, she had a severe fight with her father, and after smashing his head again, he sent her to his best friend's son's place for discipline, saying he wanted to curb her spoiled princess attitude.

Upon their first meeting, Henry sat in his office on the top floor of the Wilson Group building, his gaze behind his gold‚Äîrimmed glasses as cold as ice.

Of course, she didn't want to stay there.

So she caused trouble in every way she could.

On her first day of work, she spilled coffee all over his million‚Äîdollar custom‚Äîmade suit. Henry merely glanced at her indifferently:""Italian cashmere, put it on the Green Family's tab.""

The next day, she deliberately threw the meeting documents into the shredder. Henry remained unfazed, reciting the entire contents on the spot, stunning the executives in the meeting room.

On the third day, she slipped something into his coffee, setting up a camera to capture his embarrassing moment and blackmail him.

But it turned out to be an aphrodisiac.

She woke up the next day, aching all over. Rose was furious and wanted to kill him, but Henry pinned her against the floor‚Äîto‚Äîceiling window.

""Rosie,"" he bit her earlobe, his voice hoarse,""Be good.""

That single ""Rosie"" completely disarmed her.

Since her mother's death, no one had called her that for a long time.

From then on, their relationship completely changed.

Every time she caused trouble, Henry would simply carry her into his office. Outsiders thought he was going to discipline her, but in reality, he was punishing her on his desk.

Gradually, she found herself addicted.

Was it because he was so tough during sex? Or because she only had sex with him?

She didn't know.

She only knew that she had fallen.

So on his birthday, she spent the whole day decorating the villa.

Roses, candles, music, even an engagement ring was ready.

But Rose waited the entire night, until the candles burned out and the roses withered, he never came back.

At three o'clock in the morning, a news alert suddenly popped up on her phone‚Äî

#Powerful Tycoon Picks Up True Love at Midnight#

The photo showed Henry carefully escorting a girl in a white dress into a car, his eyes so tender it was painful.

The comments section exploded:

""OMG! The ruthless tycoon and the sweet innocent girl‚ÄîI SHIP THEM SO HARD!""

""Whoa! Isn't that Mr. Wilson and Ruby Perry? Back then, they were the golden couple of our school!""

""I was in the same school, I can attest to this! Mr. Wilson is cold to everyone, but only smiles at Ruby Perry! If Ruby hadn't gone abroad for health reasons, they would have gotten married by now!""

Her phone clattered to the floor with a loud clink!

Rose couldn't believe her eyes.

If Henry's heart always belonged to someone else... then what was she? Just some convenient booty call?

She tremblingly called Henry, wanting an answer, but the phone remained unanswered.

After the last hang‚Äîup, Rose put down her phone and walked into Henry's study, a place he never let her enter.

The moment she pushed open the door, she was struck by lightning‚Äî

It was filled with pictures of Ruby Perry.

Graduation photos, travel photos, and even stolen shots of Ruby sleeping.

Even the always cold and self‚Äîpossessed Henry could do such a thing.

Whether she needed an answer seemed to no longer matter.

Rose suddenly laughed, her laughter echoing strangely in the empty room.

Laughing and laughing, hot tears streamed down her delicate jawline and splashed onto the floor.

She smashed the entire villa in a rage.

When Henry returned the next day, he saw the wreckage and simply called for someone to clean up.

He didn't even glance at her, as if what she had done was perfectly normal.

Rose watched helplessly as the maids swept her meticulously prepared engagement ring into the trash.

He didn't know what was in that box.

He didn't know she had wanted to spend her life with him.

He didn't know that the moment the ring was swept into the trash, she had also decided to stop loving him.

""Ms. Green, where are you going?"" the driver's voice pulled her back to reality.

""Home,"" Rose opened her eyes, her voice icy,""To the Green Family.""

Back at the Green Family villa, James Green immediately rushed over:""Rosie, you really mean you're willing to marry into Seraphina?""

Upstairs, her stepmother was also looking at her expectantly.

""Really."" Rose's eyes were icy,""But didn't I say I had a condition?""

""What condition? Tell me!""

""I want to‚Äî‚Äî"" Rose said each word slowly,""sever our father‚Äîdaughter relationship.""

The air suddenly froze.

James Green's face changed drastically:""You've gone mad! Do you know what you're saying?""

""Couldn't be clearer."" Rose's voice was as cold as ice,""You had an affair while married, forcing my mom to jump off the building to make way for this woman. From that day on, I didn't want to acknowledge you as my father.""

She stared at James Green's livid face:""Now the dying crown prince of Seraphina is offering a five hundred million dollar reward to find someone to marry him for good luck, and you've been pestering me for three months. If I don't agree, were you planning on tying me up and sending me there?""

""So what difference does it make whether we sever ties or not?"" she sneered,""You can just bring your mistress's daughter home and let her be the heiress of the Green Family.""

James Green trembled with anger:""Fine! Sever it! But the crown prince of Seraphina supposedly won't live past the end of the month, you must marry him before then!""

He sneered,""As for your stepmother's daughter, she came back from abroad two days ago and has been staying at a hotel. Since you're willing to step aside, she'll move in tomorrow!""

Rose burst out laughing, her heart aching:""You're so eager to raise someone else's child, but you don't love your own daughter, you're truly unique.""

She turned to leave, but her stepmother, Jade Perry, feigned concern, stopping her and saying,""Rosie, how can you talk to your father like that?""

Rose stopped abruptly.

She slowly turned around, her eyes swirling with years of suppressed hatred:""Oh? Do you think that once I get married and leave this house, you can act like the legitimate wife?""

She approached step by step,""Jade, listen closely, my mother's death won't change the fact that you are a despicable mistress! Even if your precious daughter becomes the heiress of the Green Family, it won't erase the fact that her mother is a mistress!""

Jade Perry's face turned pale instantly, stumbling back two steps.

Rose turned and walked away, each step feeling like she was walking on a knife's edge.

Only after returning to her room and closing the door did she slump to the ground, burying her face deep in her knees, as if all her strength had been drained.

Early the next morning, noisy sounds of moving and laughter came from downstairs.

""What's going on?"" she pushed open the door,""Can't people even sleep?""

The butler stammered:""Ms. Green... your younger sister is moving in...""

Before he finished, a familiar figure appeared at the top of the stairs‚Äî

Ruby Perry, wearing a white dress, stood there softly.

1lzma7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lzma7i/being_shirtless_at_my_house/,Being shirtless at my house.,"Please help me understand why it seems so many people are weird about me being shirtless. 

For context

- I own my home with my wife. 
- I run very hot. I mean HOT. I am in shape, but my metabolism is higher than mt everest. 
- there are no kids around
- around 72* I begin perspiring and generally I am toasty (I have been checked by a doctor multiple times, so don‚Äôt tell me I might be dying in typical Reddit fashion lol)
- I live in the north and in a non-conservative area. So I‚Äôm not around a bunch of evangelicals or something. 

I simply enjoy not having my shirt on for comfort and to keep myself cool. 

Activities I prefer to do shirtless:

Running outside, working out in my home basement gym, sleeping shirtless, lounging drinking coffee, bbq‚Äôing, or playing guitar on the porch or back deck. 

Now the issue arises with the fact that my wife and her family (my in-laws) always comment or tell me to put my shirt on. I am perplexed. If it‚Äôs just my wife and me, she won‚Äôt say anything unless I‚Äôm going for a run. Then she will say I should put a shirt on. 

My brother in law even dropped by for an actual 30 seconds one time and commented semi jokingly with a chuckle, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt put a shirt on when you‚Äôre going have guests?‚Äù.

Am I the asshole for thinking it‚Äôs okay to be shirtless? Anywhere else I go, be it friends or siblings or other houses, I would never think to comment or impose on how they feel comfortable to make me more comfortable unless it was WILD like they were smoking meth next to babies or something. 

Be honest please.

That was Reg‚Äôs motto. You had to finish what you started. Otherwise, what was the point? He always tried to see things through and regretted it when he didn‚Äôt. He had gone to school to study law and halfway through the first year had realised it wasn‚Äôt for him. The sticking point was having to represent someone you knew was guilty. All the best lawyers could do it but he knew deep down he wouldn‚Äôt be able to.

Still he had stuck it out for the four years and got his degree. He had made friends he still had today and he had enough legal knowledge that when he was unfairly dismissed from the insurance firm he worked for, he was able to represent himself. He won the case and saved a bundle in legal fees.

He had stayed married to Dolores, his first wife, even after the relationship went sour. They had two kids together. Tom and Diane. A kid is an 18 year commitment but the rot in their relationship started to set in after 8. She would snipe at him, even insulting him in front of their children. He knew any love between them was gone.

But being a Dad wasn‚Äôt a job you could quit so he stayed for another 10. Dolores was vindictive and he was more than sure that if he had divorced her, she would have taken the kids just to hurt him and he wouldn‚Äôt have seen hide nor hair of them in their teens. And those times, though turbulent, he wouldn‚Äôt trade for anything.

He even watched Game of Thrones to the end. That wasn‚Äôt easy. Then at a role-playing convention, he had trauma bonded with another fan who had suffered through the finale. That fan, Lucy, later became his partner. She was a great person and he loved her more than he could articulate. Life kept teaching him that it was good to see things through. In for a penny, in for a pound.

Maybe it was curiosity that made him stay to the end. He remembered a book he had read. The Incredible Shrinking Man by Richard Matheson. He wasn‚Äôt really enjoying it. It was a depressing tale about a man who is exposed to a gas that makes him shrink and shrink.

His wife forgets about him and keeps him in the basement. On his shrinking journey he has a brief romance with a little woman from a visiting circus but he shrinks past her too. In the basement he gets so small that he has to fight for his life against spiders, using a pencil as a spear.

Things looked bleak. Every time he went to sleep he would wake up smaller again. He was now miniscule and thought this night would be his last. But this time when he wakes up he has passed over to the subatomic realm where an exciting new frontier of adventure awaits.

Reg was glad he had kept reading to the end.

The philosophy of seeing things through had served him well in his 45 years but Reg‚Äôs brother Pat was a different story. Pat never finished anything. He dropped out of his English degree because the other students were too pretentious. He quit his job as a tour guide because his boss was an asshole. Reg tried to tell him, most bosses are assholes but it didn‚Äôt seem to matter. You put up with it, you do impressions of them in the break room, then you go home and put work behind you.

Reg had watched Pat break it off with girlfriend after girlfriend for the flimsiest of reasons. This one wasn‚Äôt funny enough, or smart enough. They had too many ‚Äúred flags‚Äù but to Reg the flags looked pink. The same kind of little flaws everyone had.

One lady, who he knew Pat regretted dumping. Her name was Alice. She was gorgeous, kind and great craic. However, she was always about 20 minutes late. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the big deal?‚Äù Reg had asked his brother. ‚ÄúJust read a book, go on your phone.‚Äù But no, she was imperfect so she had to go.

After all the quitting and dropping out, Pat ended up without much of a life to show for it. No family, no job, and only one friend, Reg himself. Finally he had done the ultimate dropping out, ending his life at the age of 43.

Amidst the maelstrom of grief, Reg kept coming back to the same question. Why kill yourself at 43 when 44 could be the year it finally all came together? Why walk out of the movie before the third act?

Reg missed him. He was a dour man, sure, but once he was done talking about his own problems he was a pretty good listener. He was also a great guy to watch a crappy dumb movie with.

Not long after Pat did what he did, a publishing company got in touch, they wanted to publish one of his poems.With Reg‚Äôs help it was published posthumously. You just didn‚Äôt know what was around the corner.

It was a Sunday and Reg had nothing on. He intended today to be nice and relaxing. Lucy was out with her friends, at the Korean place in town. She was with her three besties and he knew they would eat Gochujang, and stay for hours, having drinks and catching each other up.

He had the place to himself for the next few hours and he knew exactly what he would do. Listen to podcasts and finish his lego Death Star. He adored Lucy but it was nice to have some time to reflect on the week.

He had everything set up and ready to go when he hit a snag. Literally, there was something snagging on his cardigan sleeve. He carefully rolled back his sleeve and found the culprit, it was a hangnail, protruding from the left side of his left thumb. Irritating but nothing he couldn‚Äôt deal with.

He had a system. He would fill a small dish with warm water and soak the nail to soften it. Then taking his trusty tweezers, he‚Äôd rip the bugger out. He prepared his surgical bay, placing the dish and tweezer on the arm of the couch. The whole thing shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few minutes, and soon he would be in his lego happy place.

His phone connected to a bluetooth speaker and the familiar jingle of the podcast intro rang out. It was his favourite, Pod People. It was dedicated to the dark side of life. True crime, cults, conspiracies and the like.

This episode was dedicated to the terrifying case of Josef Frizel, who kept his daughter locked in a basement for 24 years, where he raped her and fathered children with her. He felt a twinge of guilt at listening to something like that but reassured himself that he wasn‚Äôt the only one, or the podcast wouldn‚Äôt be popular.

The hosts were two American friends, one Christian and the other into death metal. They had a running gag where the wholesome one would accuse the other of getting off on the macabre stories. Listening to it felt like being in the same room with some good friends.

He set a timer on his watch and soaked his thumb, removing it after 2 minutes. He took the tweezers, the same ones he used to pluck his unibrow, and gripped the extruding end of the hangnail.

He winced at the pain he knew was coming. But it was necessary. A hangnail would seriously affect his dexterity when it came to building the movie accurate exhaust channels of the Death Star. The errant keratin would have to go.

He braced himself and pulled. He felt the expected pain, saw the expected blood, but felt none of the expected relief. Dabbing away the blood he saw the hangnail was still attached, now jutting from the joint in his thumb. He paused, his mind working. This was a turn up for the books. He had never known a hangnail to extend this far and he examined it with fresh curiosity.

How was it even possible? Wasn‚Äôt the soil of a hangnail, so to speak, the nail bed? Could this be growing from some place deeper? The bone maybe? Thoughts of soil turned his attention to his garden. He looked out the living room window which gave a view of the back garden.

It was a modest 5 by 7 metres with a small tool shed. He took particular pride in his roses. Scarlet Carsons. They were sleeping right now but he looked forward to spring when they would break free with their customary bold shade of red.

He wanted to turn his attention to happy things, lego, the garden, maybe a nice cup of tea, but the hangnail was now hogging all of it. The laughter of the podcast hosts grated on him and he realised he would not be able to really relax until He dealt with it.

It was a hangnail, just a particularly long one, so the solution was the same, pull it out. It would be a funny story to tell Lucy when she got home. Perhaps he would even keep it and show it to her, though that would be cruel, as she didn‚Äôt like ghastly things.

He took the tweezers and started to pull. It was deeper than he expected and felt like ripping a cable from underground. All he could do was keep pulling, in a continuous motion, hoping that at any moment it would be torn free. He watched in confused horror as it kept going....showing no signs of reaching an end. Feeling light-headed and needing a break from the pain and exertion, he stopped, although the sought for relief was nowhere, the thing was still attached.

This was becoming...unacceptable. He felt sadness as he felt the prospect of an easy Sunday slipping away. The hangnail now emerged from the base of his thumb, at the place where his thumb met his hand. It was almost two inches in length. At a loss he decided to google it. Using one hand to work his phone while the other awaited its fate.

Google offered no salvation. People had hangnails that had to be surgically removed. There was also something called bone slivers but they only happened in serious accidents where the bone was shattered. He looked at the pictures with morbid fascination. They were horrifying but didn‚Äôt look like what was happening to him.

While on the phone he got distracted and bought a book he didn‚Äôt need. He knew he was procrastinating and he had to deal with this before he coud return to his life.

He grabbed the hangnail, it was long enough now that he didn‚Äôt need the tweezers and could use his other hand, and began to pull. The pain was...intimate. He felt like a robot that had gone crazy and was pulling out its own wires.

The podcast hosts started to advertise a health drink. He didn‚Äôt want to let go of the nail so he couldn‚Äôt skip it which added to his torture. He had seen the drink on YouTube, it was green and looked like something you would give a sick cow.

He had to stop again and when he did the hangnail (if it could still be called that) was sticking out of his wrist. Just above the strap of his casio digital watch, which he removed. To his amazement he realised that he would actually have to remove his shirt as it still wasn‚Äôt over.

He had to drag the sleeve over the hangnail and his fresh wound, causing a cruel jolt of pain. He threw the shirt aside. There was a wellspring of blood and the paper towel couldn‚Äôt cope, it was completely red with blood except for one white corner. He would need a towel.

He went to the hot press to get one. On the way he left red spots where his blood dropped on the living room carpet. He would be in trouble when Lucy found them. He found a white and red tea towel and wrapped it around his arm.

He noticed how calm he was being but he knew he was like that, anxious most of the time but calm when the shit hit the fan. He sat back down on the couch, holding his hand in the towel like he was afraid it would fall off. The absurdity of the whole thing made him laugh.

He cleaned up the blood as best he could then used the towel to get extra purchase on the nail. In for a penny in for a pound. He started a new round of pulling. The uprooted nail dug a trench down his arm as he pulled it out. He screamed from the pain, which was like hot needles driven though his bone. He had to keep screaming to keep going.

He wondered if the neighbours could hear. Norris, the man living next door, was a retired doctor. Rationally he knew he should be seeking medical help. Maybe it was some macho programming but he just wanted to take care of the nail himself without getting anyone else involved. The nail was now almost at the joint of his elbow, he could wrap it around his right hand to get a good grip. Doing so made him gag.

He took a second to rest and breath deeply. The thing was now almost at his shoulder. He could see the carnage he was wreaking on himself but he resisted his mind‚Äôs attempts to comprehend it, knowing it would probably steal all his conviction. Every single inch had been hard won, like ground in World War 1. With destroyed flesh the casualties.

He tried to pull again but this time the pain far outweighed any progress. He shifted it maybe a millimetre and was rewarded with an artillery shell of pain that hit his shoulder but sent shrapnel everywhere else. It also blasted away his resolve.

I just need a second, he thought and leaned over face down on the couch. His nose was pressed against the cushion and he could smell the smell of the house. There was a faint hint of the curry he and Lucy had had last night.

Thinking of Lucy cut even deeper and he produced a little sob. When crying he never managed to get out more of a sob or two before something stopped him. That macho programming again. He‚Äôd give anything to be in her arms. Telling her about this rather than actually going through it. He thought of her coming home and finding him in this posture of defeat, and he hated it so he sat up.

Thoughts of defeat led to thoughts of capitulation. Maybe he and the nail could co-exist. He could cut it off at the shoulder, keep it covered under clothes and trim it every now and then. Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad.

No, he drove out the thoughts. He couldn‚Äôt trust the nail. What if it wasn‚Äôt content with his flesh? What if one night as he slept it inched its way towards Lucy, searching for new lands to colonise. No, no peace. There was only room in his body for one of them.

His brain tuned back into the podcast. They were aughing at what that woman had gone through. How could they? He thought. Didn‚Äôt they know people were suffering?! Still he didn‚Äôt turn it off. Somehow he thought the silence would be worse. Just then he got the notion that running his arm under a cold tap would do the world of good, would cure him in fact.

He went into the kitchen and placed his arm under the tap. He looked at the water because he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to look at his arm. It ran red for much longer than he would have liked. He didn‚Äôt like that he was being afraid so he forced himself to look. What he saw made him throw up. It looked like he had shaken hands with a combine harvester.

He stood by the sink, the tap still running, washing away a rancid cocktail of vomit and blood. the taste of vomit in his mouth. It felt good to get it out of him but he knew he‚Äôd never feel right again until he got*it*out of him.

How long had it been in him, he wondered. Reg had always had a bad constitution, getting sick every flu season, tiring easily. Was it because this stowaway was there all along, taking the nutrients that were rightfully his to fuel its abominable growth?

Reg‚Äôs curiosity was enflamed. How far did the thing go? He would find out, even if it killed him. He turned off the tap and dried himself with a mostly clean tea towel. The one he had gotten previously lay on the counter, soaked with blood and useless. He hated to think about how much flesh he had lost and how much more he would lose before the day was over.

To ensure victory he would need better weaponry. His thoughts turned to the garden shed where he kept his DIY stuff. His mind was filled with images from an old movie. In it the character loses his hand, then goes to the toolshed and with a few adjustments transforms himself into a killing machine with a chainsaw for a hand. He thought a chainsaw would be overkill but he still liked the imagery.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a big surprise coming to you‚Äù he said to the hangnail. It was approaching 2 feet in length. It had a stiffness to it and bobbed alongside his arm like a sinister erection. Just looking at it made his stomach lurch. He went to the backdoor and put on his coat and boots to go outside.

Blood from his arm stuck to the lining inside the coat and the numbness in his left hand made lacing his boots difficult. It overcast outside, Mid-December in Ireland. Despite human attempts to derail it, Nature was keeping to her schedule and had made it chilly.

On his way to the shed he stopped by the rosebed. There was nothing to see and he wondered if he‚Äôd be alive to see his beloved roses bloom. He opened the door to the shed, or armory as he thought of it. He took his red toolbox from a shelf and placed it on the worktop. He rummaged around for the pliers, feeling a sadistic pleasure thinking of what he could do to the hangnail.

Then his eyes landed on something that stopped him searching and made him grin. In the centre of the worktop was a vice. What better tool to hold the damned thing in place while he ripped it out of him.

Knowing he would lose his nerve if he hesitated he guided the hangnail into the jaws of the vice and turned the wheel. The nail was thin so he had to turn the wheel all the way to clamp it in place.

He realised the best thing to do was to sling the hangnail over his shoulder and turn away from the vice. That way when he moved forward he could rip it out. The shed was small and he was able to reach out and get the fingers of his right hand around the door handle. He was glad at how secure it felt.

He was atheist except for the most dire occasions and he mentally whispered a prayer. ‚ÄúPlease God, let most of me be intact.‚ÄùHe pulled himself forward. The nail bit into him and scared it might re-enter him that way he found an old sheet used for painting, folded it into a kind of belt and placed it under the nail.

He dragged himself forward again. It felt unnatural to cause himself so much pain, like asking a maniac to stab him in the chest.

Gouts of blood splashed onto the ground. With the nail slung over his shoulder he was reminded of the Strongman competitions he used to watch with his father and brother when he was a boy. He didn‚Äôt care much for sports but they had enough of the freak show to be fun. He thought now of those mountains of men, dragging train cars behind them. In their teeth he seemed to remember but that couldn‚Äôt be right.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm weak, I can‚Äôt do it, I‚Äôm weak, I can‚Äôt do it.‚Äù He thought. Yet he was doing it. His mind was useless in this situation. It was only his will that mattered. He assessed the damage, there was a meaty canyon extending from his shoulder to his left nipple. He couldn‚Äôt actually see his nipple which might have been in laying with the blood on the ground. Oh well, he thought, I wasn‚Äôt using it anyway. The nail looked stronger than ever, its base an inch across and slightly concave. It had some nerve, acting like it was a normal part of his anatomy!

It was obvious where the final showdown would be. His heart. The soil where it gorged itself on his blood. Its roots like a cage around his heart.

He kept pulling forward. It was like the nail was bonded to him at the molecular level and ripping it out split the atom, triggering atomic explosions of pain. He kept pulling himself forward. In for a penny...

His consciousness wavered and he held onto the door handle as much to keep himself awake as upright. His body begged for a chance to shut down. He didn‚Äôt have to look to know the hangnail was now coming straight from his heart, like a knife left by an unfaithful lover. It was only when he stopped screaming that he realised he had been. Somewhere in the distance he heard a lawnmower. That‚Äôs right. It was Sunday. Lazy Sunday.

His chest was almost level with the door now. So he opened it and let himself fall to the ground. As he fell he heard something snap as one of the nails moorings broke. The pain was like a point blank gunshot but he didn‚Äôt care, it was his first taste of freedom.

He could feel a puddle of blood underneath him, like taking a hot bath in the November air. This was the heart blood, life‚Äôs blood. He could feel the satanic claw of the nail loosen its grip. He didn‚Äôt care if it killed him, as long as he died free.

He resumed pulling, and screaming. He was grateful for the money he had spent on the vice, which prior to now had mostly been used to crack walnuts. He grabbed handfuls of dirt and grass and dragged himself forward with strength that must have been drawn from the earth itself. He was numb to the pain, numb to the damage he was inflicting on himself, deaf to his own screams, he just wanted it gone‚Ä¶

He awoke and knew it was over. It was gone. He felt empty. Like a gutted fish. He could feel wind howling in the empty spaces inside himself where the nail had been. But it was gone.

In a panic he looked around to check where it was. He didn‚Äôt want it to crawl back inside him. He didn‚Äôt think he could face another round. It lay in a black circle of blood soaked earth. It looked desiccated, like a dead spider. Looked dead, but he didn‚Äôt trust that. The base of it, where it had infiltrated his heart, looked like a mockery of a heart made out of twisted thorns.

He looked down at his chest and saw the sheet he had used had been remade as a bandage to cover the gaping wound. It was soaked through red. Although he could still see the little flakes of white paint. The part near his heart was crumpled up and looked just like a rose.

That‚Äôs when he noticed there were arms around him. Lucy? No, they were a man's arms. White and strewn with freckles. They held him up in a sitting position. The owner of the arms spoke and it was Norris, his next door neighbour who must have come when he heard screaming.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He answered weakly.

‚ÄúWhat happened? Was it an accident with one of the tools?‚Äù

He must have seen the trail of blood from the shed to Reg‚Äôs resting place.

‚ÄúNo, a hangnail.‚Äù

Norris laughed.

‚ÄúYeah, right.‚Äù Norris said.

Reg gestured to the remains of the hangnail.

‚ÄúWhat is it, some kind of root?‚Äù Norris asked.

‚ÄúSome kind,‚Äù Reg answered.

‚ÄúWe need to get you inside where it‚Äôs warm.‚Äù Norris said, sounding concerned.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Reg said firmly. ‚ÄúFirst we get rid of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, what would you like me to do with it?‚Äù

Reg wasn‚Äôt sure if Norris was just humoring him. But it didn‚Äôt matter as long as they did what was necessary.

‚ÄúThe compost bin,‚Äù Reg said, pointing to the end of the garden where there was a large black rectangular bin.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Norris said, gently lowering Reg down. Reg continued to watch him, using a herculean effort to keep his head raised. Norris reached for the hangnail.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Reg shouted. ‚ÄúFor God‚Äôs sake don‚Äôt touch it.‚Äù The thing could just be playing dead.

‚ÄúGo to the shed,‚Äù Reg instructed him, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs another sheet. You can use it to wrap it up. Carefully.‚Äù

The urgency of Reg‚Äôs tone must have gotten through to him and Reg was glad to see Norris now approached the nail with proper caution. Taking the sheet he gingerly wrapped it while being careful not to touch it himself. Norris took the mummified form over to the compost bin and lifted the lid. Reg watched him so closely that Norris could feel his eyes on him.

Reg took composting seriously and the compost bin was big, about half the size of a skip. Layers of decaying matter would be left there for months until they turned into a rich fertiliser that was destined for Reg‚Äôs beloved rose bed. It would make a good tomb for his foe.

Norris dropped the nail inside.

‚ÄúClose the lid‚Äù, Reg said.

Norris came back over to Reg. Swiping his hands together to signify a job well done. He helped Reg to his feet and carried him wounded soldier style back into the welcoming warmth of the living room. With a great delicacy he managed to get him onto the couch with only minimal agony.

The couch, where the whole nightmare had begun, what seemed like an eternity ago. The podcast was still going but had moved on to another episode, this one about the Heaven‚Äôs Gate cult. He knew all about it but still he let it play.

‚ÄúWhere do you keep your bandages, Reg?‚Äù

‚ÄúUpstairs bathroom, medicine cabinet.‚Äù

Norris had been in his house before and knew his way around. He had been over several times for a cup of tea. (he was the generation of Irish person where this was simply expected) He got to work and Reg could tell he felt much happier in the familiar territory of helping a patient, rather than whatever the hell had been happening with that strange root...

Reg had never thought highly of Norris, he had always seemed a bit aloof. He was a canny businessman as well as a doctor. He had purchased a floundering medical journal, restored it to glory and then sold it on for a phenomenal profit. Although they exchanged the usual neighbourly banter there was no disguising the fact Norris‚Äôs house was twice the size of Reg‚Äôs and he even had a Koi pond.

Clearly he had misjudged him because here he was, helping him in his time of need. You never knew who would be there for you. It was mid-way through these reflections that Reg passed out again.

He awoke to the sound of gentle mirth and clinking spoons from the kitchen. Lucy was home. The knowledge of that flooded him like a powerful tranquilizer. The haphazard dressing on his chest had given way to more expert bandaging. Norris‚Äôs handiwork. It was dark out. He checked his watch. He‚Äôd been out for 4 hours.

The podcast was silent. Lucy didn‚Äôt like it, called the hosts as ‚Äúcackling ghouls‚Äù. There was a steaming hot mug on the coffee table. He picked it up, the small movement was like doing the last rep at the gym but he was rewarded with a soothing sip of tea. Ah, tea, nectar of the gods.

‚ÄúHello‚Äù, he called out, announcing his presence.

Lucy entered the room. He blinked away tears and held out his arms, feeling like Karloff‚Äôs The Mummy. She hugged him tightly and he yelped.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she said, and embraced him more gently.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

Tears stung his eyes as he gave in to the feeling of being looked after.

‚ÄúHow did you know I‚Äôd be awake?‚Äù He said, glancing at the tea.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt, I just kept making them. That‚Äôs the fifteenth one. I wanted you to have something hot when you woke up.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I do,‚Äù he said, winking.

She shook him gently and he felt waves of pain emanating from his track of wounds.

‚ÄúOw.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think you‚Äôre in a fit state to make those comments?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am,‚Äù he said smiling.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you call me?‚Äù She asked, becoming serious.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù And he didn‚Äôt. Why not enlist her help in battle? She was his greatest ally after all.

‚ÄúSilly man,‚Äù she said and leaned in for a kiss. Norris entered with impeccable timing. He held a cup of tea and wore a friendly smile. Lucy pulled away.

‚ÄúAh you‚Äôre awake.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúHow are those bandages holding up?‚Äù

He came over to Reg and started expertly tugging at the bandages. He seemed satisfied. He entered Doctor mode:

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back tomorrow to change them. The ones on your arm aren‚Äôt that serious, it‚Äôs your chest I‚Äôd be worried about. You should really go to A and E.‚Äù

Reg shook his head. The Irish healthcare system was a complete shambles. Unless you were actually knocking down death‚Äôs door you‚Äôd be waiting 10 hours to be seen. In a cold waiting room with fluorescent lights, surrounded by strangers. He didn‚Äôt fancy it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take my chances‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúI have a good nurse.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuit yourself.‚Äù Norris said, shrugging. ‚ÄúMake sure you get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou patched up my wounded soldier,‚Äù Lucy said to Norris. ‚ÄúHow will I ever repay you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe tea and biscuits should cover it.‚Äù

And you have enough money already, Reg thought and felt bad for thinking it. Money or not he was obviously a caring man. Feeling deep gratitude, Reg held out his hand to Norris who accepted it.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Reg said.

‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Lucy said, ‚ÄúNorris said this was all caused by a hangnail? Is that right?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù Reg said.

Lucy was incredulous.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true,‚Äù Norris said. ‚ÄúI saw it myself. It was...‚Äù He struggled to convey it. ‚ÄúOne for the books.‚Äù This gave him an idea. ‚ÄúIn fact, it would make a hell of an entry in the journal. Of course, I‚Äôd just have to take some pictures...‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Reg said adamantly, ‚Äúno one goes near it.‚Äù

Norris retreated. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the boss,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWell, the wife has been sending me texts. She‚Äôs ready to send out search and rescue. I better be off. Thanks for the tea, Lucy. Reg, mind yourself. No more life and death battles, for a while at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood,‚Äù Reg said.

Norris left by the front door, exchanging a string of goodbyes with Lucy as he went. With Norris out of the way Lucy gave him his deferred kiss. It too was one for the books and made the whole day of fighting seem worth it. She helped him up the stairs which had somehow transformed into Kilimanjaro.

He got into bed with her, something that never failed to make him giddy, despite the 5 years they had been together. Under the covers, she began to talk to him in the conspiratorial whisper he knew well.

‚ÄúReg, hun, was it really a hangnail?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said, feeling indignant.

‚ÄúBut how did it get so big?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeats me.‚Äù

There was a silence into which he felt like interjecting lots of things, but they all felt impolite. Finally he found what he wanted to say. ‚ÄúYou believe me don‚Äôt you, Luce?‚Äù

Whether she did or not she chose to. ‚ÄúYes, hun,‚Äù she said, and gave him an affirming kiss on the head.

She went to sleep quickly, as was her way, and he was left with the pain which was like a chorus of voices, vying for his attention. ‚ÄúRemember me?‚Äù They seemed to say. He found by resting his head against Lucy‚Äôs chest he could quiet them, and like this he slept.

It was March. A Sunday. Reg had taken the last 3 months off as sick leave but was scheduled to return Tomorrow. He looked forward to the return of normalcy. He stood in the living room, hot cup of tea in hand.

The blood stains in the carpet had long since been cleaned. Lucy had put up a show of complaining but he suspected she was glad it wasn‚Äôt the outline of his body she was cleaning.

He felt like a new man after getting the nail out. There was a spring in his step and some days he felt 25 rather than the 45 he was. He guessed not having an unwelcome passenger siphoning his lifeforce would do that.

He had finished the lego Death Star and a number of other builds as well. Including Mt. Doom from Lord of the Rings which was over 7,000 pieces.

People asked him what his secret was and he felt like telling them it was buried in the back garden. He looked out at the rose bed. He was delighted to see small green dots that showed they were starting to bud. Lucy had been applying fresh compost during his convalescence and it had done its job. He marvelled at nature, its resilience and immortality.

He noticed something else sticking out of the soil, whitish grey, and curved like a banana. A piece of trash that had blown over the wall he assumed. He went outside to pick it up. He wanted his roses pristine. His heart froze when he saw what it really was. The nail. Alive and about the thickness of his wrist, it extended about a foot from the soil and pointed at him threateningly.

Well, he thought, going to the shed to retrieve a trowel, in for a penny in for a pound.

1lzm8w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lzm8w1/bug_anxiety/,Bug Anxiety,"(This is my first time here so I'm not sure what qualifies as sensitive content, but mods plz let me know if I should put spoiler tags on anything, the last thing I want to do is cause someone else anxiety)

So I've always had issues with insects, specifically infestations. Like if I see bugs just out and about, even in my apartment, most of the time I am totally fine. Spiders have even become welcomed guests since I know they'll take care of any bigger issues. However, my anxiety starts when there's any chance of infestations, or rather when I lose my ability to control my environment. The example I like to use is opening a trash can and flies start to swarm out of it, which would really quickly freeze me up and cause me anxiety, while a single fly in my apartment is absolutely no trouble for me.

Back in October 2024, shortly after moving into this apartment, we had an infestation of flying ants. It was never more than 8-10 a day at its worst, but was enough of a problem where I needed to go stay with my mother for a few days until my anxiety was more prepared to come back (like 3 days). My boyfriend took care of the apartment while I was gone and we eventually got a pest tech to treat the bathroom, but it was like this 2 week long thing where my anxiety seemed out of control.

Before I continue, here's some more details: I work from home, so I am ALWAYS here. The flying ants in October was really weird, since normally the flying ones are only active in early summer since they're trying to mate and start new colonies. The good news is that since it was almost winter, these ones were basically already dead and were incredibly lethargic. Anyways, moving on.

So of course, this morning I see a flying ant trying to get out of a window in my office. Almost immediately, my anxiety that I hadn't experienced since October comes back and I'm kinda freaking out. My boyfriend is wonderful and is helping me calm down, but it's been almost 3 hours now and I'm still sorta on edge. It's like my entire chest was on fire, my stomach felt sick and painful, and while deep breathing would help temporarily, the anxiety would be right back once I stopped. I don't even think the ant is the whole problem, I think it just kick-started a bit of anxiety and then I started spiralling about a whole bunch of other stuff.

I'm doing a bit better now, but not amazing. I guess I just vent like I needed to vent somewhere and seeked this sub out. Thanks for reading y'all.

Things I do to help: I like to do this thing which I call a ""once-over"" where every hour or so, I'll do a real quick inspection of my apartment and just make sure there's nothing I can see. I check all the potential hiding spots I know of, the walls and ceiling, and just reassure myself that even if there's things I'm not seeing, I have this under control. I'm also drinking herbal tea instead of coffee this morning, and I'm gonna find some ambient music to listen to while I work instead of anything up-beat and energetic. I'm also not trying to speak or think anything into existence, instead just working with the information I have and keeping it at that.

As someone who savors their daily coffee ritual, I genuinely wanted to explore whether this sleek, space-saving machine could meet my caffeine-related expectations.

**Compact and Stylish Design**  
One aspect that immediately caught my eye was just how slim and sleek this coffee maker is. At less than 5 inches wide, it fits snugly in my limited counter space, a lifesaver in my tiny kitchen. Despite being compact, the matte black exterior adds a sophisticated touch that pairs perfectly with modern interiors. Its stylish aesthetic doesn‚Äôt compromise functionality, and I find it blends practicality with design seamlessly. The removable drip tray is an unsung hero‚Äîit‚Äôs large enough to hold a mess if the cup overflows and keeps cleanup stress-free.

**Surprisingly Versatile Brewing Features**  
Testing the brewing features revealed how easy it is to operate this machine. The three brewing size options‚Äî8, 10, and 12 ounces‚Äîaccommodate a variety of mugs, even my oversized weekend cup. I played around with brewing times, which stayed consistently fast, delivering hot and fresh coffee every time. Multistream Technology stood out most for me. It extracts the coffee‚Äôs full flavor profile from the K-Cup pods, providing a richer experience that almost feels artisan despite the machine‚Äôs efficiency. You guessed it‚Äîno more watery coffee tragedies.  

[Check Keurig K-Slim 5000357869 price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b083248s3b/)

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Operating the Keurig couldn‚Äôt be simpler, as it relies on intuitive button-based controls. Even my technology-challenged parent found it straightforward. The removable 46-ounce water reservoir is another great feature‚ÄîI could brew four cups before needing a refill, perfect during the morning rush. The auto-off function, which kicks in five minutes after the last brew, impressed me by adding convenience and being energy efficient. A machine that‚Äôs both smart and responsible? Seriously, it‚Äôs like having a mindful barista on the counter.

**Strengths**  
- Compact design preserves counter space without sacrificing performance.  
- Multistream Technology brings out coffee's full flavor for a premium experience.  
- Removable reservoir and drip tray make cleaning and maintenance straightforward.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The water reservoir, while removable, could be slightly challenging to clean due to its design.  
- Although mostly quiet, the brewing process can sometimes produce noticeable noise, which may bother light sleepers during early mornings.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Looking into similar coffee makers such as the Nespresso Essenza Mini and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, I noticed notable differences. The Nespresso has a sleeker finish and works well for espresso lovers but falls short on cup-size versatility. Meanwhile, the FlexBrew shines in allowing single-serve grounds or pods, yet its design feels bulkier and less elegant. Where the Keurig outshines these models is in blending compact size with robust brewing options. It hits a sweet spot for users who want efficiency and a multi-purpose K-Cup experience without comprising on taste or aesthetics.

**Affordable Quality**  
Balancing its advanced features, smart design, and ease of use, this coffee maker sits comfortably in the reasonable price range against its competitors. It‚Äôs ideal for those seeking a reliable machine without spending excessively. While not the cheapest on the market, its value proposition aligns with its performance.

The other day I reached Intro to Focus 15, but unfortunately didn‚Äôt really feel like I actually made it to Focus 15. When I tried again yesterday however, everything changed.

During my second run with Intro, the transition from Focus 12 and Focus 15 was much more intense. Once I counted to 15, my body was vibrating heavily and felt completely flat, like a cartoon character that got run over with a steamroller. Not only that, but all awareness I had of my room that I felt during Focus 12 was completely gone, and I only sensed darkness, breathing, and the occasional swallow. I had finally reached Focus 15! Now that I made it, I decided to do some tarot pathworking, an occult practice revolving around travelling through tarot cards in meditation to discover secrets of the universe. I tried to summon up The Magician to begin with on a whim, but the card spun around and turned into the Queen of Pentacles. She took the coin in her hand and flipped it out of the card, where it landed in my hands. Out of nowhere, the protagonist from the anime Kakegurui, Yumiko Jabami, appeared and leaned in close to me.. She said that Focus 15 will bring great things for me in the future. After that I moved back into Focus 12.

Then I went into Focus 15 once more, and the first major thing I saw was a map I saw from my dream last night. It was kind of like a video game map that charted out a cave network that had a massive tree and an entire ocean within it. That vision quickly passed and gave way to something far stranger. Before my eyes laid a cloudy mass that acted as a sort of television screen. This cloud showed me sitting in front of three monitors, writing an unintelligible string of text. Then Aqua from Konosuba came up to my desk and gave me a cup of coffee. As if this whole thing couldn‚Äôt get any weirder, I felt myself getting pulled into this cloud, the vision slowly warping into a sort of physical reality. It didn‚Äôt last long however as I was pulled out and everything disappeared back into the void.

I was honestly worried when I failed to get into Focus 15 the first time that I might get stuck at this point for a while. But I‚Äôm so glad to be proven wrong, and now I can‚Äôt wait to see what Focus 15, and Focus 21 real soon, will bring!

Well usually it's simple mop stock prep stock start and clean counters gather trash and do shift change. Now this easy as it's over night work depending on who is relief different times to finish. Many of you may insult me like the one person does and that's fine you do you but also see it from my view.

üëÄvisuals: 8.5/10, visually pretty appealing, certainly more than alot of street cannabis i have encountered, however i have seen more visually appealing medical grade cannabis, great terps though and very crystally, very bright green almost sativa like.

üëÉüèºscent: 8.5/10, very confusing scent to describe but not unpleasant by any means, slight coffee undertones maybe? floral? however it is a very sweet scent.

üëÑtaste: 9/10, taste how it smells but its more pleasant as a flavour rather than scent personally, nice chest hit, may make you cough if you have sensitive lungs.

‚úãüèºtouch/feel: 9/10, quite sticky, will leave residue on your finger tips but not too much, quite small dense buds however it fluffs up nice when chopped up in a grinder.

BATCH NUMBER: 250606

# 107 Pax Galactica III

### Uintrei and Beth

As the executive officer of a ship that launched nuclear and strategic weapons, it was probably a good thing for everyone involved that Uintrei never saw combat again. Eventually, her captain Bert retired, and she was promoted into his place. A few years later, she too retired at the rank of rear admiral, after the Federation military integrated with the Republic‚Äôs and the rank systems were unified.

On the other hand, Beth accepted early retirement in the drawdown. She went back to school to study acting and graduated just in time to play herself in a movie about the Battle of Znos. The movie was critically well-received. Her performance, however, received mixed reviews. Critics praised her passion and energy, and Znosian reviewers gave her props for voicing herself in the Znosian language version of the film, but they questioned whether her portrayal was realistic. One online critic loudly complained that no real person would act like she did under continued stress.

Beth and Uintrei moved to a resort town in Gruccud. Federation law had no issues with inter-species marriage. Some Malgeir had been marrying their Granti and Schprissian neighbors for centuries. It was a simple administrative matter to add their new Terran friends to the list.

For a couple of years, they campaigned to make inter-species marriage legal in the Terran Republic as well. There wasn‚Äôt that much actual political opposition to that, but with the war over and all emergency powers returned to their rightful place, the lawmaking apparatus of the Republic went back to moving at its regular glacial pace.

Their friends from their Staff College days would visit from time to time: Kaja, Durnio, Maurice, and Speinfoent.

Uintrei and Beth adopted four children: one Granti, one Malgeir, one Znosian, and one human. They were all loved equally, though when asked privately, the new parents would admit that the Znosian hatchling speed-running through puberty in four months was a major relief.

++++++++++++++++++++++++

### Eupprio

Eupprio became the richest person in the known galaxy. Eupprio Tech itself became a massive conglomeration of hundreds of horizontally integrated industries, many of which were highly successful in their own fields.

A few years later, at the urging of some Senators in the Republic, the Federation underwent serious economic reforms to overhaul antitrust regulation and combat corruption. This lobbying was, of course, completely altruistic and had nothing to do with the growing number of Republic corporations that ran into‚Ä¶ ‚Äúregulatory difficulties‚Äù as they expanded into massive new Federation markets.

Eupprio Tech was legally broken up as part of a settlement agreement, but each of the pieces still did very well.

Eventually, it seemed impolite for Eupprio to continue to hold on to that much money while not doing anything with them, so she invested almost all of her accumulated credits into the reconstruction efforts of the Malgeir and Granti worlds that had been occupied by the Znosians. Unsurprisingly, when those colonies recovered from the devastation of the war, the ensuing economic boom made her investments more returns than she put into them. Far more.

Even with a responsible amount of donations to various worthy causes, her bank accounts kept filling up faster than she could empty them. It truly was a hard life for Eupprio.

She also considered running for public office, but Fleguipu ‚Äî who remained her loyal friend and advisor ‚Äî managed to talk her (and the galaxy) off the ledge.

++++++++++++++++++++++++

### Torsad

When High Councilor Guinspiu passed to old age, she was buried next to her mate. That was never in question. And neither was who her successor should be.

Grantor City Mayor Torsad was near-unanimously nominated and voted to the position of High Councilor. She served four three-year terms. During her terms, she rebuilt the Granti military before it was fully absorbed into the Coalition Navy. She oversaw twelve straight years of unprecedented economic growth, a result of her listening to good advisors‚Ä¶ but really mostly because the Granti had been so utterly devastated by the war that any recovery looked like miraculous growth. 

She was present at the signing of the Znosian instruments of unconditional surrender.

Publicly, as the head of the Granti people, she endorsed a plan that would result in the Znosians being forcibly divided into six competing states, and that certain social policies be enacted which simulation computers predicted would fuel a multi-century blood feud between each of the resulting rump states with no end in sight. Her people wanted blood; the more, the better. 

In the backrooms where real diplomacy was done, she accepted total demilitarization as a compromise.

And by the end of her terms, she‚Äôd had enough of politics and administration. She stated in a clear and succinct speech, ‚ÄúIf drafted again, I will not run; if nominated again, I will not accept; if elected again, I will resign.‚Äù

They mostly left her alone after that. Contrary to her morbid predictions that she would never survive the war, Torsad outlived most of her age peers to the age of 150. Rarely, every few years, she would make an off-paw comment about current events or pop culture to journalists, and all of the New Granti Alliance would treat it like gospel. For the last fifty or so years of her life, the running joke in Granti political society was that *this* was going to be the year she would pass, and when it finally did happen, almost the entire civilization showed up to bid her farewell.

Her former lieutenant, Insunt, on the other paw, became a teacher. A high school chemistry teacher. All that he learned during the war, and all that time he spent working under Torsad (who was herself a former chemistry teacher) ‚Äî he never thought it would come in so handy. Insunt brought his love of chemistry to high school students.

Of course, there were some inevitable accidents here and there, and he was often reprimanded for encouraging some of his students‚Äô more reckless impulses, but nobody got *seriously* injured. 

Insunt himself lived to be quite old. Old enough to see five generations of his adopted Znosian hatchlings, gifted every single one of them, become productive members of Granti society despite the prejudices created by war.

++++++++++++++++++++++++

### Felix

‚ÄúAce? Did you hear me, Ace?‚Äù

*I hate this job.*

Felix smacked his face with his own open palm repeatedly. He had inherited the position as head of the SRN when the former Ace of Clubs died four years ago. 

Heart attack. 

Horrible tragedy.

His people whispered that the Reps might have been involved. Some kind of conspiracy. The Terran Reconnaissance Office back at their old, dirty tricks again, probably. The inconclusive autopsy results fueled the suspicions.

But Felix knew the truth. 

He was the one who slipped the nerve agent into her drink.

He just did it because the Ace was going insane, giving paranoid orders that didn‚Äôt make sense and dictating random, delusional projects on a whim while killing her own people without reason. Felix didn‚Äôt seek power. He was just a radio man. A maintenance tech. A lieutenant. He didn‚Äôt want the responsibility of leading a former terrorist group that was now the actual government of Bunnyland, or Spofke ‚Äî as the locals called it.

The regular bureaucratic nightmare was boring enough. This‚Äî this was way worse. 

Now, he‚Äôd never regretted killing the former Ace more. She‚Äôd have known exactly what to do in this situation; it would have been something utterly insane, sure, but at least she‚Äôd have *something*.

‚ÄúHow many people did the assholes get this time?‚Äù he asked his lieutenant.

‚ÄúSixteen fatalities, Ace,‚Äù she reported. ‚ÄúSixteen of ours. Twelve kids, four of the staff. The attackers never planned on getting out. They just detonated the homemade explosives as soon as we surrounded the building.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow many attackers?‚Äù

‚ÄúFour.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll four of them are Buns?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll Buns,‚Äù she confirmed.

‚ÄúAny group claim it yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, the Free Bunnyland Cult took full responsibility this morning.‚Äù

They called themselves the Free Spofke Gang, but it was close enough.

‚ÄúThey sent it on the radio with their propaganda. We couldn‚Äôt figure out how to jam them for two hours,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúBut we found the source, one of their old industrial cities. They abandoned the radio station before our terminators got there. We‚Äôre still trying to find the big shots, but‚Ä¶ we think they‚Äôve gone underground.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt we agree with Farce that civilians can‚Äôt be the target of attack?‚Äù Felix sighed hard. ‚ÄúA children‚Äôs daycare center? How could they?! This is so completely out of line!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, that was clearly prohibited in the status normalization agreement with Governor Farsot last year. She sent her condolences this morning, by the way. But the Free Bunnyland Cult doesn‚Äôt care about those rules! They‚Äôre‚Äî they‚Äôre like a totally separate group. Znosian rogues and outliers.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn terrorists! I knew we should have deported all those damn Buns‚Ä¶ years ago!‚Äù Felix said in exasperation. Of course, he knew that would have cost them far more in lives and resources, but that didn‚Äôt stop him from fantasizing about an alternate universe where everything just went according to plan and nothing else.

‚ÄúShould we begin preparations for another cult crackdown campaign?‚Äù she asked earnestly. ‚ÄúWe can crank up our production rate to sixteen thousand clankers next month. Once we stockpile enough, we can hit all four continents simultaneously. They won‚Äôt even see us coming.‚Äù

He considered the possibility for another minute, then shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôll piss too many of the other Buns off, and they‚Äôll just‚Äî that will just turn more of them against us. We can‚Äôt risk another Bunnyland mass uprising. Last time was expensive enough, and if we get another‚Ä¶ our tourism industries will never recover! The Schprissian developmental loans‚Äî if this keeps up, we won‚Äôt be able to afford even just the interest payments! Get Governor Farce, and ask her what they want to‚Äî to fix this. More inclusivity training for our frontline officers, perhaps? Or do they want us to increase our Bun employment quotas? At this point, if they really want our robots out of their northern coastal plains, I‚Äôm tempted to take the deal if she can provide ironclad security guarantees.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about the‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre keeping the Red Tar Sands though. That part‚Äôs not negotiable.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir. I‚Äôll talk to Farce this evening. What about the stock markets‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMonitor trading on the day side when it opens. If we can leak rumors of a potential agreement, maybe it‚Äôll calm things down enough before Malgeirgam wakes up. And if the futures market dips too much, increase our positions there. If we can‚Äôt stop the bleeding, at least we can shore up our budgets.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood. And there was just one more thing, Ace‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe leased Rep Navy base around Bunnyland-11, their nosy base commander‚Äî they called this morning to express condolences and to see if we needed‚Ä¶ security assistance with the matter. They say‚Äî they added they have extensive experience in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations. I think‚Äî I think they‚Äôre talking about us back when we‚Äî‚Äù

Felix understood the subtext instantly without her unnecessary elaboration. And he knew the base commander over there; they probably thought this was all just a major cosmic joke. He‚Äôd be surprised if they managed to record the entire message in one take without pausing to giggle.

‚ÄúTell them to fuck off and mind their own damn business. This isn‚Äôt funny at all!‚Äù

++++++++++++++++++++++++

### Speinfoent

After dating for another two years, Speinfoent and Kaja got married.

Speinfoent transferred to the Coalition Navy when the Malgeir and Terran militaries unified years later, and he retired shortly after at the rank of Admiral. A building at Charon‚Äôs Staff College was named after him. There, several tactical maneuvers taught by the Coalition Navy were credited to him, and ‚ÄúThe Sphinx Maneuver‚Äù referred to at least seven different ways to set an orbital ambush.

Speinfoent started a podcast to talk to lost young adult Znosians about their purpose in life now that their Prophecy had been widely discredited as an obvious lie. It went way better than he expected. As it turned out, six hundred star systems were a pretty big audience. He toured the galaxy, giving speeches and interviews to adoring fans wherever he went. A former State Security holdout group attempted to assassinate him on tour, but the assassin was torn apart by a fluffle of his rabid fans before they could get the shot off.

For about a decade, the most popular name for new hatchlings in the Free Znosian State was Sphinks.

++++++++++++++++++++++++

### Amelia

Amelia Waters was the last Fleet Admiral of the Republic Navy. 

She went on to serve another five years in the new Coalition Navy before the Senate forced her to retire.

Amelia went back to Ganymede, living comfortably on the pension she‚Äôd earned for the rest of her days with her husband. She helped rebuild the colony she was from, whose surface facilities had mostly been destroyed in the Battle of Sol. The Jovian and Saturnian colonies saw a major burst of emigration as their colonists left Sol to more habitable alien worlds. But enough remained that her colony survived.

For decades after, historians and tourists traveled to a specific location outside the mining colony near Oettro. Several light years out. It was said that if your ship blinked to the exact right spot, and you listened carefully to the light speed radio with a certain, declassified old Republic Navy decryption key, you could hear Amelia‚Äôs voice the moment she kicked off a chain of events that saved four species:

‚ÄúAll ships, weapons free. Waste the bastards!‚Äù

Despite several attempts by various organizations to draft her into running for Senate, she mostly stayed away from politics. It would be unfair. She did, however, occasionally appear on news segments as a guest expert. She tried her best to correct misinformation and educate the watchers on the nuances of naval grand strategy, and she was even occasionally successful.

When hostilities flared up between the Bunnyland government and a Znosian terrorist group a couple of decades later, she was called upon to mediate the conflict and broker a ceasefire. Some diplomacy commentators claimed that the rumors of Amelia showing up to the peace talks with a comically large bag of popcorn indicated a lack of professionalism on her part; others credited her unconventional approach for helping forge a lasting peace agreement between the two sides.

One of Amelia‚Äôs last public appearances was at a war gaming event sponsored by the Naval Staff College. In an exhibition game, she defeated the reigning galactic champion soundly, to everyone‚Äôs surprise. After the competition, the salty loser found discrepancies and demanded a review. The event organizers discovered Amelia had cheated, using her administrative access to the simulation computers (which they‚Äôd forgotten to revoke when she retired) and her prior rapport with the simulation digital intelligence to spy on her opponent‚Äôs secret positions during the game.

When called upon to apologize, she refused, demanding her critics cite the specific portions of the Republic Navy Code of Justice that prohibited cyber reconnaissance. Many did not find her excuse acceptable, but this did not tar Amelia‚Äôs overall legacy or affect her popularity much. She was not invited back the next year though.

++++++++++++++++++++++++

### Grionc

Grionc was the last High Fleet Commander of the Federation Navy.

She went on to serve another fifteen years in the new Coalition Navy before the High Council tried to force her to retire. She paid off the right High Councilors, and she continued to serve for another ten years until she no longer could.

When the elderly Fleet Commander Loenda passed away, she left behind a will that gave everything she had to Grionc, who she called ‚Äúmy commander, and the cub I never had‚Äù. 

And it was a *substantial* inheritance. Loenda had been in the Federation Navy for decades, before any of the accountability and corruption reforms. She‚Äôd gathered quite an enormous pile of loot. Some questions of propriety were asked, but nobody resented Grionc for accepting it. After all, she had saved the Federation. Possibly the Republic too, depending on which people you asked.

Grionc ended up donating most of it to various charities, but one purchase she did splurge on was a cozy fishing boat. She became an avid fisher, even participating in tournaments a few times. 

She wasn‚Äôt very good at it. She discovered she was a much better fisher of enemy fleet commanders than she was of fish.

++++++++++++++++++++++++

### Ditvish

Ditvish gingerly traced the spine of the freshly printed book in his paws and sniffed at it twice.

‚ÄúIt smells nice,‚Äù he commented.

‚ÄúYeah? Well, here‚Äôs hoping people find it reads nice too,‚Äù his agent said. ‚ÄúThough‚Ä¶ no offense, I think most people would be buying it for the author, not the contents.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm retired! I‚Äôm no longer an eleven whiskers of the Free Znosian Navy! And this isn‚Äôt a history book. It‚Äôs a novel. A fictional novel!‚Äù

His human agent perked up. ‚ÄúHave you considered writing a history book? Something about the war, perhaps? I‚Äôm sure people will buy that in droves too.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know enough about our history to write about it!‚Äù

 She shrugged. ‚ÄúAh well, this one will be in the romance section of the bookstore, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if some of your people bought it thinking it‚Äôs real.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt considered that,‚Äù Ditvish confessed. ‚ÄúMost of them might not know what fiction is, not to mention the paranormal romance subgenre.‚Äù

‚ÄúEh. They‚Äôll learn. I‚Äôm fine with it either way, as long as you get paid.‚Äù

He harrumphed. ‚ÄúI guess such is the nature of things given what I‚Äôve done. Maybe one day, I‚Äôll be known for being the guy who writes the best and steamiest romance stories, and not the guy whose fleets ended the Dominion.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, okay, good luck with that. Just‚Ä¶ look over it. Make sure there are no errors or anything you‚Äôd like to change‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHang on, let me go get another drink first.‚Äù

He stood up, walked to the coffee shop counter, and stood in line. Znosians still weren‚Äôt that common here on Earth, but there were enough of them for people to not be too weird about it when they saw one ‚Äî except for a few who still harbored hate from the war, but he tried not to worry about them. The barista flashed him a practiced smile over the counter-top. ‚ÄúWhat can I get for you today, hon?‚Äù

‚ÄúHot chocolate. Extra large. Add carrot juice.‚Äù

Not a regular order, but he knew the dispensing machines here were capable of that.

‚ÄúNice and healthy, I dig it.‚Äù She beamed at him as she took down the order. ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúDitvish.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be fifteen credits, sir. Thank you.‚Äù

He swiped his credit chip, and the machine beeped its confirmation of his identity. Two minutes later, he grabbed the hot cup on the counter and headed back to the table. 

As he sat down, his agent looked at the furious frown on his face with some concern. Like most humans who he worked with, she‚Äôd learned to detect the subtleties of Znosian body language, and it wasn‚Äôt that different to begin with‚Ä¶

‚ÄúIs something wrong, Ditvish?‚Äù she asked with a low voice. ‚ÄúDid we make a mistake with your book? We can still make some last-minute adjustments before it goes into print next week‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you believe it?! This‚Äî this‚Äî They made an error on my name! Again!‚Äù he harrumphed exasperatingly as he pointed a shivering claw at the egregious misspelling scratched on his hot chocolate cup. ‚ÄúDavish? Davish? Who is Davish? Not me! Oh, why can‚Äôt they allow me to enter it electronically‚Ä¶ or simply get it right?! It is a very simple name!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, come on Ditvish, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a simple error‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are *never* coming back here again!‚Äù

++++++++++++++++++++++++

End of Grass Eaters

++++++++++++++++++++++++

As the story of Grass Eaters comes to a close, I want to thank each of you for supporting me on this journey. Your feedback, encouragement, and readership have meant more than I can fully express.

With the story ending, it feels like the right time to take a break and a step back before I dive into what comes next. I will continue to write, but it will be awhile before my next story is ready. For now, what I can share is the title of the book/series:

**High Ground**

It's more of an exploration story, with a focus on a smaller cast of characters, interspersed with some fleet action. I‚Äôll be sure to share updates on the next book‚Äôs progress on my discord, so join and stay tuned.

Until then, please know how deeply I appreciate you. Whether you‚Äôve been here from the beginning or joined along the way, thank you. You've all made this project real for me.

I'm Coffee, a GM of 3 years, though I've been roleplaying for much longer! I recently caved and bought Daggerheart, and due to the narrative focus of the system I wanted to get to know the game through PBP.

**The GM's History:** A *long* history of roleplay, back to rather cringey experiences on messageboards and skype. More recently and of much more import, I cut my teeth with TTRPG's running a short Pathfinder 1E game, followed by a few D&D 5E one-shots and a 2-year-long Pathfinder 2E campaign. I'm currently running a Shadowdark game and another PF2E game.

**The GM's Style:** I typically fluctuate post lengths, usually spending a few paragraphs setting new scenes, followed by shorter posts in reaction to players to keep narrative events flowing smoothy. I like running narrative-driven games across all pillars of gameplay, and tend to avoid combat encounters where 'killing everything' is the only way to achieve victory. I enjoy romance, fireside talks, wilderness traversal, overall the less high-stakes aspects of fantasy. I tend to be rather forgiving with allowing silly hijinks in my games despite leaning towards creating more serious settings, and greatly favor rulings over rules and improvized rolls. I like providing character references and maps on top of narrative description.

**The Game:** While I've read over the rules, there's nothing quite like playing the game to get to truly know it! For this reason I'm looking to open play with the Daggerheart Quickstart 'The Sablewood Messengers', leaving a good deal of blanks so I can identify what my players and I enjoy from the system to direct play more toward those areas. I don't want to make assumptions and set up a campaign that would end up better suiting another system, and I prefer catering the narrative to the characters my players want to play regardless

**The Desired Player:** I am admittedly dealing with a glut of players in my in-person games and would like to play out something smaller, so I'm looking for only 1-3 players at this point! An ideal player to me is passionate about their character, is comfortable asking questions in and out of character when unsure about a mechanic or an event that took place previously, and focuses on doing what fits the narrative/their character rather than taking the 'optimal' mechanical action. Artists, moodboard and playlist-makers are adored!

**How To Apply:** Reach out to me with a comment or a dm! I'll do my best to respond to everyone within a reasonable time.",6,1752498117.0,pbp,4,1.0,False

1lzlq2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1lzlq2a/the_problem_with_how_caf√©s_serve_people/,the problem with how caf√©s serve people,"i ordered a coldbrew online today from a well-known caf√©. nicely branded, well-rated, the kind of place that shows up in curated lists. but the drink that arrived was close to undrinkable. overly sour, strangely salty, no real depth, and a mouthfeel that didn‚Äôt hold together. it left a harsh aftertaste that lingered far longer than the taste itself deserved. it cost ‚Çπ200, which isn‚Äôt a small price for a black coffee. maybe it was just a bad day. or a rushed brew. maybe they assumed a delivery customer wouldn‚Äôt notice. maybe they didn‚Äôt care.

this reminded me of a very specific experience at another caf√© not too long ago. also highly rated, also charging a premium. i ordered a V60 pour over (a drink that, by nature, demands care.) what I got was a cup that tasted overly acidic, almost sharp in a way that dried the mouth. it felt incomplete, like the coffee didn‚Äôt want to be brewed that way. curious, i asked what beans they used. they pointed to a large, generic bag of commercial grade coffee. not specialty, not traceable, not the kind of origin you'd expect from a pour over that cost ‚Çπ240. i must‚Äôve looked confused, because the guy behind the counter smiled and said something that implied, ‚Äúwe thought you were new.‚Äù and that stuck with me.

do caf√©s really decide what quality to serve based on what they assume about the customer? how they‚Äôre dressed, who they‚Äôre with, what they order? do they reserve their best only for the regulars, the obvious coffee nerds, the ones who speak the lingo? if so, what happens to someone walking in for the first time, curious about black coffee, hoping to understand what the fuss is about? if they get served a flat, careless cup made with cheaper beans just because the caf√© thinks they won‚Äôt notice, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll walk away thinking black coffee is just... bad. bitter. confusing. not worth trying again. and maybe they‚Äôll tell others the same. that‚Äôs how misinformation spreads... through bad first impressions.

black coffee isn‚Äôt just another item on the menu. it‚Äôs often someone‚Äôs first honest encounter with coffee in its raw form. it‚Äôs where taste, origin, and craft actually show. done right, it can be sweet, fruity, floral, deep, comforting. done wrong, it can be the end of a journey before it ever begins. and when caf√©s cut corners whether for convenience, profit, or assumption, it‚Äôs not just the drink that suffers. it‚Äôs the trust.

this isn‚Äôt meant as criticism, but as reflection. maybe these are just isolated experiences. but if any caf√© out there finds even a bit of truth in this, please don‚Äôt let assumptions decide the quality of your service. brew every cup like it matters. because it might be someone‚Äôs first. and it might be the reason they stay.",4,1752497914.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.83,False
1lzlpxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1lzlpxx/i_regret_quitting_my_job_to_be_an_artist_and/,I regret quitting my job to be an artist and freelancer,"dunno if this is the right place to post this or if its the right flair, but here goes:

I feel the eyerolls, but bear with me for a sec. I graduated college recently (music course), and got my first job in a small but known studio in my country. I initially joined up to gain experience more than earn, but even then, things i learned ended about 2 months in. trust me, I tried to do what I could in that place. I‚Äôd ask if there are projects I could take off my senior‚Äôs plate for practice and experience, and the response was always ‚ÄòI‚Äôll get back to you‚Äô. He never did. Even when i‚Äôd pester him daily. I asked the one above him (our boss) and same response. Instead, I was reduced to a glorified spell checker for lyrics and sheet music.

At first I didnt mind it. mindless work, easy tasks; but after working the same thing and not gaining any experience or fulfillment (not to mention earning less than minimum wage and commuting daily ‚Äî which took 1/3 of my salary btw) it felt like i was useless in the office, and wasting my talents as a musician. Oftentimes, my coworkers (all of whom are 5-10 yrs older) would exclude me, either by not including me for coffee (or other food) when everyone else was treated, or just not being told of events I could help out with, making me look like a flake. They had insisted they just forgot when confronted about it.

I hated it, but stuck it out cause the job market is less than generous, and money is money no matter how little it is. Over the next few months, I began to want to be the artist and an actual producer instead, and eventually quit that miserable job. 

Now, I‚Äôm starting to regret that decision. While I am happier and more creative than I have ever been. I‚Äôm finding it hard to find clients, and those who ARE my clients are friends who have less connections to the industry than me. It‚Äôs hard to be ungrateful since its experience, (small) income, and proof that people believe in me. But, savings are running out, and while I am searching for part time jobs to help sustain me, nothing seems to click. 

I feel like what I‚Äôm searching for from posting this is some advice or maybe reassurance from people who have been in the same situation as me.

Just a few more things about me to help give perspective:

- I‚Äôve been doing music for 10 years, so I know my stuff 
- Im in my 20s
- I have released my own music, and continue to do so 
- I have been making a media following in both YouTube and Ig to help my chances

Is something wrong with me?,"Hi everyone. If l do use any names they are not real l made them up. I just turned 18 and lve never had a first kiss or a real relationship.

Ok so for some context l grew up in a loving family as an only child amd a lot of cousins both older and younger. Im happy to have really good role models especialy from men in my family though my friends tell me l have high standards..

I rarely go out as where l live a lot of people start going out at 13 or 14 and drinking. When l entered highschool and wanted to go to a party with my friends l told them l wouldnt be drinking alcohol. My friends replied with ""why are you even going if you arent going to get drunk"" or ""whats the point in going if youre not drinking""... so that left me without a desire to go. I maybe went out two times when l was 15 and thats it(no l didnt drink but had an ok time nothing special).

I was always a bit more of an introvert though depends on a situation. I love meeting new people though sometimes my social battery just drains and l dont want to go out. I do like going out with a friend for coffee and walking around at midnight or going for food or a move all that stuff....

My love life howerver is nonexsistant sadlyü•≤. Im the type of person who doesnt fall in love easly. I may find somebody attractive but to like them l need to get to know them. I liked two guys total ever...one when l was 4 one where l was 15.

When l was 15 l met the guy at summer volleybal camp and we spent the week toghether surrounded by friends having fun as we were in the same pracice group. He was also the one who aproches me amd complimented me on my shirt during practice and thats how we started talking. I was crushing so bad... when l came home from camp l didnt even sit in the car and started talking to my dad about a guy l met and how l had a crush. We eneded up chatting through instagram for months as really good friends and he asked me to be his girlfriend. I was like a girl with butterflies in my stomach and obviously agreed but we just continued chatting like we were friends for months after. Nothing happened. We didnt even call only texts wich started to bother me later especially as we were talking less and less so l brole up with him and told him we could be friends but l didnt really feel comfortable calling it a relationship as it wasnt one... we dont talk since than as he kind of tried gaslighting me into staying toghether but thats not the point.(all happened when l was 15)

I dont really talk to guys much. I mean in my class lm in IT so theres 14 guys and 4 girls including me. I talk to the guys but its mostly about school or just talking during class and so on. Mostly talk with girls or my friends from other classes.

My friends think l might have a high standard for guys. Not physicly for that l just wish if the guy was taller than me or around my height as lm tall myself(176 cm) and preferably takes care of himself as in works out and personal hygene smells good(theese are just things l find attractive and not deal breakers). The high standard aparently is finding ""talking bad about his family constantly"" and ""treating staff bad"" a red flag? I dont know but those are some obvious red flags to me.... especially as lm big on family and a family person.

But anyways since l dont go out l dont really meet a lot of guys. My family knows this and a few of my family members especially my aunt and cousin l mentioned in previous posts love to comment on it. Older cousin Jen(20f) and my aunt. My aunt loves to know everything and loves to gossip. Jen when she was my age used to go out a lot with friends and drink and my aunt loves to bring it up knowing lm not that type of person. Also loves to ask me if l have any plans,who lm hanging out with and ect...

I would really love to be in a relationship as l havent even had a firat kiss... love my little cousin chris(15 m) but even he has a secret girlfriend! I mean l did to at his age l guess but still not my point!üòÇ

Is it normal that lm still single? Am l maybe too antisocial? My little cousin(Chris who deasnt live in the same country) tells me l should go out more but honestly where l live almost everybody knows eachother and if you dont know somebody you have a friend who knows them...and l know mostly the people who go out do i to get really drunk(not all but most my friends know)

Any advice on how maybe somebody met a partner? I have one more year of highschool and than lm goung to university hopefully and moving to another town. Any tips or advice? It would be really apreciated as lm starting to ask myself am l the problem and if its bad l still mever had a first well anything(kiss,boyfriend and so on).

Please if you can share some advice and personal experiences! Is it a problem that lm inexperienced? Im kind of freaking about about it as most friends l have have had boyfriends or atleast their first kiss.... all advice will be apreciated or even if its just a presonal experianceü´∂",1,1752497715.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

# Top Budget Picks

Enjoying a perfect cup of espresso at home does not need to be expensive. Many affordable espresso machines offer great features. These machines bring the cafe experience to your kitchen.¬†[Let‚Äôs explore some top picks that are easy on the wallet](https://gomehedi.com/best-affordable-espresso-machine/). They ensure quality and ease of use.

# ${example}

Choosing the right espresso machine can be overwhelming. Here‚Äôs a simple guide to help. Consider important factors like size, features, and price. Look for machines with user-friendly controls. Ensure it fits your kitchen space. Think about the type of espresso you enjoy. Some machines offer versatile options. Others focus on traditional espresso only. Reading customer reviews can be helpful too. They provide real-world insights.

|Machine|Features|Price Range|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Brand A|Compact, Easy to Use|$50 ‚Äì $100|
|Brand B|Multiple Brew Options|$80 ‚Äì $150|
|Brand C|Durable, Consistent Results|$100 ‚Äì $200|

Choosing the right machine is about finding balance. Look for quality and affordability. Many options provide great value. Enjoy your espresso journey!



# Features To Consider

Espresso lovers often seek machines that are both affordable and efficient. Finding the right espresso machine can be challenging with numerous options available. It is essential to consider several features before making a purchase. The best affordable espresso machines should offer quality performance without breaking the bank. This guide highlights key features to consider when choosing the perfect espresso machine.

# Pressure And Pump Quality

Pressure and pump quality are crucial for a good espresso. Pressure ensures the coffee grounds release flavors effectively. A standard espresso machine uses about 9 bars of pressure. Machines with higher pressure may not always result in better coffee. Consistent pressure is more important.

Here are some key points to consider:

* Consistent Pressure: Ensures uniform extraction of coffee.
* Pump Type: Look for machines with electric pumps for reliability.
* Pressure Gauge: Helps monitor the pressure during brewing.

Investing in a machine with good pump quality is essential. It affects both the flavor and aroma of your espresso. Cheaper machines may use steam pressure, but this can lead to uneven extraction. Prioritizing a machine with a quality pump ensures a better coffee experience.

# Build Material

The build material of an espresso machine influences its durability and performance. Machines made from stainless steel offer better durability. They are resistant to rust and damage. Plastic machines may be cheaper but often lack longevity.

Consider the following materials:

|Material|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Stainless Steel|Durable, Long-lasting|Higher Cost|
|Plastic|Lightweight, Affordable|Less Durable|

Aluminum is another common material. It offers a balance between cost and durability. The choice of material impacts not only the lifespan but also the ease of cleaning. Choose materials that fit your budget and requirements.

# Ease Of Use

For many, the ease of use is a top priority. Machines with simple controls are ideal for beginners. Look for machines with clear instructions and intuitive buttons.

Key factors include:

* User-Friendly Interface: Simplifies the coffee-making process.
* One-Touch Options: Convenient for quick brewing.
* Adjustable Settings: Allows customization of coffee strength.

Machines with automatic features can make the brewing process seamless. They reduce the need for manual intervention. A detachable water tank can also enhance convenience. Easy-to-use machines enhance the overall coffee experience.

# Maintenance Needs

Maintenance is an essential aspect of owning an espresso machine. Machines that are easy to maintain offer long-term savings. Regular cleaning ensures the machine functions well. It also enhances the flavor of the coffee.

Consider these aspects:

* Removable Parts: Simplify the cleaning process.
* Descaling Requirements: Regular descaling prevents buildup and prolongs life.
* Self-Cleaning Features: Helpful for busy individuals.

Some machines come with maintenance kits or guidelines. These can aid in keeping the machine in good condition. Investing in a machine with low maintenance needs can reduce long-term costs. It ensures you enjoy fresh coffee every day with minimal effort.

He told me we‚Äôd be fine if I took six months of unpaid maternity leave ‚Äî but when the time came, he just assumed we‚Äôd live off my line of credit, without a single conversation.

Hallway: Coat hangar, shoe rack to left behind front door. Right wall has a radiator so considering stylised radiator cover with lamp and mirror above.

Dining area:

The kitchen is already fitted so dining area is quite limited in size. I am considering banquette style dining area either centrally below the window or on one of the corners.

Kitchen: Two low profile stools for the breakfast bar. Statement lighting above the breakfast bar.

Living area: Three seater sofa placed in middle of room facing right-wall but slightly off center towards the French doors. Wall mounted tv with low tv console beneath. Coffee table in front of sofa. Rug partially under sofa and under coffee table. Two small statement chairs to the right hand side of the sofa with a small side table between. Artwork or mirror hung on the wall between kitchen/ living room. For the exterior wall near the stairs, either bookshelf or sideboard.

Open to suggestions. And will look to do a full rendering based on feedback. Thanks!",2,1752496930.0,interiordesignideas,0,1.0,False

**>>>>>>CHAPTER SUMMARIES<<<<<<**

**CHAPTER 25 -** ¬†**VIRGINIA -** ***Oligarchs:***¬† The Sovereign meets with the trillionaires that have been made rich by war, along with Quicksilver who is the lone quadrillionaire. They have Senator Krieg listing their ~~demands~~ recommendations and it is clear they think they'll get everything they want because Virginia needs their money and manufacturing.¬† In response, Virginia calmly stands and shoots an outrageously priced statue before calling them extortionists and pointing out that if they won't cooperate, other Silvers will.¬† She tells them to vote with her or be punished.¬† Then she and Holiday ti Nakamura head for Sunhall, because ‚Äúthe Goblin has made a new mess‚Äù.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 26 - VIRGINIA -** ***The Goblin‚Äôs Prey:***¬† Sevro has been acting as a lone wolf, exacting revenge for the kidnapping of the children.¬† This time, he has killed the Duke of Heads (the Syndicate's chief assassin) and left his head in Virginia‚Äôs office.¬† She is worrying about Sevro, who has a huge bounty on his head due to the path of destruction he has torn through the Syndicate, and considering why she's having such a hard time solving the political puzzles in front of her, when Holiday enters with good news.¬† Theodora, the Sovereign's spy master (who tortured Lyria) has captured the Duke of Hands.¬† Virginia and Holiday head to the interrogation area where they learn more about the Duke of Hands from Theodora.¬† He has pheromonal defense mechanisms that allow him to seduce and control people by releasing pheromones, but this didn't work on Ephraim because of all the zolodone! He is also trained in psychosonics.¬† Smelling salts and earcaps are required for interacting with him and, sure enough, a defenseless Holiday is almost lured into killing the Duke of Hands so he won't get interrogated. Virginia has been born with internal defenses designed by her father, which interpret the pheromones as vomit-inducing.¬† She uses a new technology on the Duke called pyschoSpikes which can manipulate and edit memories, causing the Duke to forget the conversation they've already had multiple times.¬† Virginia is able to interrupt him and finish his sentences, messing with his head and also killing time until Sevro gets there.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 27 - VIRGINIA -** ***Pack:***¬† Sevro and the Howlers are lurking in the rafters but not coming down at first.¬† It's clear that Sevro doesn't trust Virginia.¬† When she finally lures him down with coffee and a joke, they debate their positions.¬† They trade barbs about whether it was nobler to abandon your child for the Republic or vice versa.¬† They argue over whether Victra‚Äôs plan of revenge killings is prudent.¬† And then Virginia reveals that she knows all about Victra's real plan and the situation with their children, which she has been orchestrating to her purposes.¬† The Sovereign has deduced that Sefi holds the children and has been using them as leverage to get control of the helium mines on Mars, which Victra will help her do as ransom. This will work out in the Sovereign's favor because Sefi will take care of the Red Hand and the Sovereign can cut Quicksilver out of the helium trade, teaching the Silvers a lesson and swinging the vote her way.¬† When Atalantia attacks, it will serve as leverage to get Sefi in line with the Republic.¬† Sevro is convinced that Virginia is on his side, so he and the Howlers officially report for duty.¬† His first task is to handle the Duke of Hands by revealing to the man that all his memories have been compromised via the psychoSpikes.¬† Shockingly, Dancer appears in the images! Then, the Duke's entire personality and memory bank are erased, making him a clean slate which Theodora will reprogram as a Splinter who can be used by the Republic.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 28 - EPHRAIM -** ***Karachi:***¬† Lessons with the skuggi are not going well because they can't lie.¬† Pax watches Ephraim teach and suggests he make it into a game.¬† Knowing the Obsidians love to gamble, Ephraim turns a card game into an object lesson on lying.¬† By bluffing successfully at Karachi, the skuggi begin to make some progress towards Ephraim's goals for them.¬† As the skuggi practice, the White *logos* named Xenophon talks to Ephraim about the state of things in Alltribe.¬† The decision to leave Darrow and create a single Obsidian homeland was counseled by the shaman, who Xenophon clearly dislikes, and the *logos* disagreed but remained loyal to his Queen. He cautions Ephraim to learn that lesson as well, rather than cross any of the Obsidians. Freihild gives Ephraim similar advice about remaining loyal to Sefi, while also thanking him for a skillgift that will help her people reclaim their honor.¬† Valdir stops by to observe, but it seems his real interest lies in Freihild, and both Pax and Ephraim have deduced that they are having an affair behind Sefi's back.¬† Ephraim warns Pax to stay out of it and also suggests they work on some plans they might need if escape becomes necessary.¬† Ephraim is making inroads not only with the skuggi, who seem to accept him more each day, but with Pax.¬† The boy has taken a liking to Ephraim, who got him access to a garage with a gravBike he can fix up, and they are bonding.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 29 - VIRGINIA -** ***The Dust of Reverie:***¬† Darrow's mother invites Dancer over and tricks him into a meeting with Virginia. Sevro is also there.¬† The Sovereign and Sevro confront Dancer with the memories of the Duke of Hands:¬† the Duke and Dancer were lovers.¬† Dancer confirms that he a) didn't know the man's real identity, and b) didn't reveal any important information to the Syndicate. The three deduce that Publius must be the Senator aligned with the Syndicate Queen given his swift rise in government and all he stands to gain should the current Republic leadership fail. Virginia realizes Publius never intended to support her.¬† Reflecting on his love for Ares and the Republic, Dancer pledges to vote with the Sovereign and help save the Free Legions.¬†

**CHAPTER 30 - VIRGINIA -** ***Ocular Sphere:*** ¬†Surveying the universe from Octavia‚Äôs Ocular Sphere, Virginia reflects on the loneliness of leadership. She misses Darrow too much to even think about him and wonders whether she could survive the loss of her family.¬† Sevro and Virginia go over the plan to strike the Syndicate during the vote while Sevro captures/kills the Syndicate Queen.¬† Kavax and Daxo join them in the sphere as people gather below to witness the vote.¬† Kavax sends Sevro on a (useless) mission to retrieve his cane so he can get a moment alone with Virginia.¬† He tells her she is good and that she never gets the credit she deserves.¬† She has earned the win on this vote, and Kavax plans how they will all celebrate when it is accomplished.¬† Reminding Daxo that he wants grandchildren, Kavax heads out with Sophocles to the seaside.¬† Sevro teases Daxo about cloning Kavax so they could raise him from a baby and wed him to Electra.¬† *(Recapper‚Äôs note:¬† Everyone is too happy and I am very scared.)*

**CHAPTER 31 - VIRGINIA -** ***Day of Red Doves***:¬† The vote begins with a speech from Daxo as he introduces the resolution to give Virginia command of the fleet.¬† Each group of Senators has a chance to speak, but Publius subverts Virginia's expectations and forgoes his chance to denounce her.¬† Dancer begins his own speech and part way through he starts to choke on his own blood.¬† He collapses as a wave of blood and lung tissue pours from him and he dies amongst the Vox.¬† Virginia realizes that a coup has begun and she warns Holiday, who is already exchanging fire with the traitors.¬† Publius denounces Virginia as a murderous tyrant, blaming her for the deaths of Dancer and many other Vox Senators (also choking on blood).¬† Daxo, Virginia, and those still loyal to her try to flee, but as the mob approaches they prepare to fight instead.¬† Daxo rips away his toga and dominates the battlefield briefly, shocking the attackers with the sheer brutality and power bred into Golds.¬† He and Virginia do a lot of damage but are separated by the attacking mob, and both go down.¬† Virginia is brutalized and carried away.¬† She witnesses Daxo being beheaded by a large Red woman she recognizes as Lilath, her brother's brutal ally and somehow now the Queen of the Syndicate.¬† Virginia can hear Eo‚Äôs song as she is borne away.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 32 - DARROW -** ***In Wake:***¬† The Free Legions hold a funeral for the massive number of casualties they have sustained.¬† Morale is low and everyone but Screwface seems out of energy.¬† Darrow puts on a brave face until he can meet with his inner circle privately. Rhonna has been searching the tunnels for Alexander, who did not return with the throngs of refugees he helped save.¬† It is a small comfort to her when Darrow tells her 83,476 people are alive because of Alexander.¬† They stop searching and collapse the tunnels.¬† Darrow, Screwface, Harnassus, and Thraxa discuss the situation they are in.¬† There is no good news:¬† anti-radiation meds are low and everyone is experiencing symptoms, food and ammunition have dwindled, and Atalantia will shoot down anyone who gets near her or tries to leave the planet.¬† Thraxa councils letting the civilians die to preserve the Legions as long as possible.¬† They consider surrender but realize they will all be tortured and killed or enslaved.¬† Darrow says they will trust in Virginia and wait for her help, because death is preferable to slavery. They will share everything with the civilians while they wait.¬† And then Rhonna enters with a message from Atalantia, who wishes to talk.¬† She has news about the Sovereign.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 33 - DARROW -** ***The Devil‚Äôs Deal:***¬† Atalantia and Darrow talk via screens.¬† She taunts him with the story of [Pyrrhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus), who won battles against the Roman Empire that caused such catastrophic losses to his side that he lost the war.¬† Atalantia plays the footage from the Senate where Daxo dies, and Darrow realizes that if Virginia isn't already dead she will soon be executed.¬† No help is coming, and Atalantia calls him [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) for striving so hard at his hopeless cause.¬† She says it would have been better to seize power in the Senate at his wife's side than to trust in the disease of demokracy.¬† Atalantia gives Darrow 24 hours to consider her offer:¬† surrender and accept ceremonial execution for himself and his high command as well as slave labor for his men, or refuse and she will annihilate Heliopolis with atomic bombs.¬† Darrow believes she is bluffing, since the Votum would depose her if she destroys Heliopolis, and Atalantia allows that it is his gamble to make.¬† Darrow feels incapable of rational decision-making, so he gives the burden to his high command.¬† He leaves Thraxa, Harnassus, Colloway, and Screwface to lead the high command to a decision and vows to accept any fate they choose.¬† Then he retreats to his room, holding Pax‚Äôs key.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 34 - LYSANDER** ***- Shadows of War:***¬† Alive but suffering greatly from wounds and lack of water, Lysander plods through the desert with Kalindora and Cicero as well as their remaining men.¬† Half of Lysander's face is melted and Kalindora has cauterized her arm where it was cut off.¬† Lysander's mind wanders to memories of his family, especially of the time as a boy that Octavia taught him never to let his mind sleep but to keep his Mind‚Äôs Eye alert, and to exist alongside pain rather than succumbing to it.¬† The group stops to rest for the night and Cicero, the only one to retain a sense of humor, relates a story of hunting as a boy with his father, Kavax, and Nero au Augustus. Nero ran all night after a gazelle so he could kill and eat it. His father tried to one-up him by killing and serving a lion.¬† Kavax waited a whole month before sending them a young lancer named Darrow to show what Mars was becoming.¬† This seems to be when Cicero realized his father was weak. Cicero and Lysander discuss how water will run out days before they reach Erebos.¬† Cicero wants to abandon or kill the Greys so that the Golds can make it across the desert, but Lysander objects and vows to kill Cicero if he tries this.¬† Cicero says Lysander doesn't understand the impetus behind his calculating plan: it's not for self-preservation but for Mercury, which is being destroyed by Atalantia, who his father cannot stop alone.¬† Nevertheless, Lysander insists Cicero will have to kill him first to get to the Grays, and hearing Cicero‚Äôs mutterings, Kalindora offers to keep watch while Lysander sleeps.¬†

**CHAPTER 35 - DARROW -** ***Endure:***¬† Everyone is slowly dying of radiation sickness, with the Reds faring the best.¬† Darrow and Screwface go outside to witness men performing a sort of confession-baptism ceremony in the sea, which frustrates Darrow and causes him to realize he may not believe in the Vale anymore.¬† Suddenly, scores of huge obelisks breach the protective shield and land on the sand.¬† Upon inspection, Darrow and Screwface discover they are stamped with the Republic star and contain medicine, food, and materiel.¬† There is also an inspiring and touching message from Mustang to Darrow *(I'm not crying, you're crying)* along with her intelligence files and analysis, including news of Pax.¬† When they return, Harnassus alerts Darrow and the high command that Publius au Caraval has contacted him with orders to arrest Darrow because the Senate and Atalantia have agreed on the terms of surrender. In response, Harnassus has sent a message of *‚ÄúBloodydamn!‚Äù* to Atalantia and shot a full barrage of their cannons, which destroys one of her ships.¬† Shouts of *‚ÄúHail, Reaper!‚Äù* ring out.¬† Darrow renews his belief that his wife and son will be restored to him and that the Free Legions - his other family - can be brought home.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 36 - LYRIA -** ***Victim:***¬† Lyria is being tortured with light and sound and randomly inverting gravity, so that she can never sleep. At the beginning, Victra came to tell her she was happy about Lyria‚Äôs agony and thought it fair to take the girl‚Äôs sanity in exchange for her daughter.¬† Lyria has lost track of how long she's been held captive since.¬† She gives up, laying in her own filth and not bothering to eat or drink.¬† She reflects bitterly on how she has failed everyone she loves by running, hiding, and watching her whole life instead of fighting back.¬† So Lyria decides that will end and she will start to fight.¬† She eats and drinks when the feeding slot opens. She uses strips of cloth from her pants to devise a blindfold, ear plugs, and straps to hang from the ventilation duct so she can rest despite the gravity shifts.¬† And when Volga manages to pass a message written in blood through the vent, Lyria decides to answer it despite recalling that it was Volga who shot Kavax.¬† Maybe Ephraim used Volga just as he used her.¬†¬†",1,1752496904.0,bookclub,19,1.0,False

Got diagnosed probably around the end of May, started meds about a week before moving overseas. I was prescribed 25mg Adderall and my pulmonologist (? -not sure if I got that right) gave me a month's supply. We have not gotten in touch with any doctors yet and we've been here a little over a month so I'm out of meds. We're not sure when we can schedule an appointment so that we can get those so it could be a few weeks before I have any meds to take. 

I am going to a youth camp for my church and I know there are lots of physical activities planned and we'll be waking up very early. I know this group can and will talk into the early hours of the morning so I probably won't be getting nearly enough sleep to function/wake up easily. 

My mom did say caffeine might help, but I'm honestly not sure as we don't do coffee and my mom can't handle caffeine, so I've very rarely had any, except in small amounts like trying some random flavor of pepsi years back (my dad literally poured it into like a shot glass- no clue where he got them from actually because we don't drink either- but yeah). 

I basically just want to know if any of you have tried using caffeine to keep yourselves alert, and/or if you think it could help me at all. Side note- I feel like my hypersomnia is pretty mild compared to some of y'all, like I suffer from the general exhaustion and like brain fog but I don't sleep crazy amounts like some stories I've heard on here, but it's not easily manageable without my meds.

1lzlb4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lzlb4w/i_24_f_found_myslef_in_this_uncomfortable/,I (24 F) found myslef in this uncomfortable situation with (27M) guy I got to know from a friend,"So I met this guy a while ago in a group outing with a friend. We talked a bit, but nothing flirty or anything. I see him regularly as he happens to work somewhere near my workplace. So we sometimes chat a little (he always initiates as I'm not very talkative by nature especially that I'm too shy). Early on, he told me that he finds me cute, so I told him that I don't want things to go that way between us as I didn'thave feelings for him. 
One time, he told me that he wasn't feeling very motivated to work, and I told him that I also was feeling a bit down (due to some personal issues that were happening at that time). So out of no where, he asks if he could do something to me but ""I'm not going to like it"". I naively ask what he meant and he said that he wants to give me a massage to cheer both of us up. I tell him that I'm fine and I refuse. There were few minutes of silence. Then he gets up to leave and approaches to give me a massage. At this point, I snap and say no and immediately leave. I stop talking to this guy until a few weeks later, we happen to meet at a friend's place. That evening, I was packing a few things alone in a room, he then steps in and slaps my bare skin shoulder and rubs it for a few seconds while standing behind me. I completely froze, I didn't know what to do until it stopped and he continues walking by without even looking at me like it was nothing. I honestly left whatever I was doing and went outside to rationalise what happened. A few minutes later, I grabbed my things and left. I felt disgusted and didn't know what to do. I still saw him by chance a couple of days later, and I had flashbacks of that evening and felt angry with myself. I was so angry with myself that I couldn't take it anymore especially that he still talked to me casually, so I decided to confront him. One time, I saw him again and ofcourse he wanted to start some small talk with me. I told him that I need to tell him something and that it concerns that evening, he immediately got so excited when he remembered, his eyes were full of happiness. This scared me, and just as I was about to speak, social anxiety hit me and I couldn't anymore, so I just left without saying a word. He then started calling me and sending me texts asking what I wanted to tell him so I did. I told him that he made me feel uncomfortable and to stop talking to me. He started apologising saying he didn't know why he did that and that he's stupid and blah blah. 

I thought this was the end of it, but the thing is I still see him around (like during coffee break) and all what he does is stare at me without saying anything, and it's making me uncomfortable. 

I never told anyone about this. I feel relieved that I confronted him more or less but still when I think about what happened I get a bad feeling. What would you classify this situation as (does it qualify as harassment ? This maybe obvious but I'm too naive when it comes to these things).

Edit: after I told him this, he kind of made me feel like I was accusing him of being a creep and like I'm overreacting. Am I making what happened a big deal ?? Am I right to be concerned ??",3,1752496777.0,relationship_advice,15,0.81,False

1lzl8h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/azores/comments/1lzl8h0/report_visiting_flores_without_a_car/,Report: Visiting Flores without a Car,"I recently spent five days (four days of doing stuff) on Flores without a car. Since this topic comes up occasionally, I thought I would write up a report on my trip for others who might be thinking about doing the same thing. 

I can drive and I did plan my trip with enough time to have rented an automatic but I am also a nervous driver and the narrow and steep roads would have done me in. I personally experience mental freedom by not having to worry about a car.

I stayed in Santa Cruz so I was able to walk to my lodging from the airport. 

Day One: Full day tour with Dona Julia (great company! You should be able to find them by searching Dona Julia Flores Azores). They picked me up at my lodging. I paid about $95. I really enjoyed the tour. Did I see everything? No. But I saw enough and I liked talking to someone who lives on Flores.

Day Two: trip to Corvo. This is from Santa Cruz so I just walked to the dock. I went with Flores by Sea Boat Tours. It cost ‚Ç¨50 and then another ‚Ç¨10 for a taxi to and from the caldera. We got a bonus tour of the caves and waterfalls of Flores on the way back.

Day Three: this was a relaxing day in Santa Cruz. I walked along the water up to the old whaling factory. I don‚Äôt much swim but you could pass some time in the various swimming spots (all free). I went to the whaling museum (‚Ç¨1) which is very well done. Then I wandered over to the other side of town and had lunch at Big Love by Monica‚Äôs which is a coffee/cafe spot. After lunch, I went to the museum for Flores (also one euro). It was also well done (and dead empty!). Then I went back to my home base to relax.

Day Four: I wanted to do a trail so I picked Lajedo to Faja Grande. I believe all the trails on Flores are linear so even if you have a car, you will probably have to work with a taxi or local company to get picked up at the end and brought back to your car. I used Dona Julia (they had trekking poles to lend me and those were a great help on the trail) again to drop me off and then I texted when I was done and they picked me up. I paid ‚Ç¨50. You maybe could use the bus (in the high season) for one leg of something like this.

I had a flight out on the next day. :(

So there you go. I hope this may help someone who wants to visit Flores but doesn‚Äôt/can‚Äôt drive. You can still have a great trip!",7,1752496578.0,azores,1,0.89,False

* Is it possible to apply for an import license as a small business, or does the manufacturer need to provide certain documents on their side?
* How does the Health Star Rating system on Australian food packaging work? Is it required before products hit the shelves, and how do I get a rating?
* What should I know about food labelling compliance and ingredient listing in Australia?
* Any tips or recommendations on choosing logistics partners for international shipping and local distribution?
* Are there any common pitfalls or mistakes that new importers/brands make in this space?

1lzkzpt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzkzpt,BRIEFING USA Day Tripper: A short review,"TL;DR: Great bag, on the heavy side, packs a lot of stuff, looks cool

A while back, I posted a rundown of my sling bag collection anda few people asked about the BRIEFING Day Tripper. Strangely enough, I‚Äôm currently on holiday in Central Europe and this is the bag I brought with me. So I figured it might be a good time to dig a bit deeper.

This bag falls into a weird category, somewhere between a sling and a shoulder bag. And while I‚Äôll always lean sling-first when I can, the Day Tripper has earned its place for one simple reason: it packs an incredible amount of stuff for its moderate size.

BRIEFING‚Äôs product pages do¬†*not*¬†do this bag justice. You really need to hold it in your hands to appreciate the material and feel. I often feel like BRIEFING doesn‚Äôt quite grasp what people want to know about their bags (especially the compartments) so I‚Äôll try to give you a better idea (even though my photographing skills are horrible, if you see a nice image in the gallery, the missus is probably responsible for it)

# What It Fits

**Main compartment:**

Surprisingly spacious. No laptop sleeve or padding, but it does fit a 13‚Äù MacBook without issue. I wouldn‚Äôt throw it around, but for light daily use, it‚Äôs fine. It also fits a packable rain jacket which won‚Äôt fit in most of my slings, for instance. There‚Äôs one big internal slip pocket, a card holder, and a pen slot, oddly satisfying to use, for some reason. It also has a key connector, which I now use far more than I thought I would.

**Front zip pocket:**

Flat, discreet, and perfect for a transit card, travel docs, or anything you want to grab quickly without opening the main section.

**Two sleeve pockets (front and back):**

These are deep enough for things like wipes. And yes, I NEVER leave the house without wipes, even when the kids aren‚Äôt around.

# Carrying It for 10 Days

After schlepping this thing around for the last ten days in some picturesque European cities, I have to say: it‚Äôs heavy, and when you‚Äôre carrying multiple water bottles for the family, even the excellent shoulder pad can‚Äôt save you from feeling it. That said, the shoulder pad itself is very comfortable. It‚Äôs not easily movable, but the strap is adjustable enough that you can get the bag to sit where you want it to.

What surprised me most is that it never feels bulky, even when it‚Äôs full. I‚Äôve stuffed it with a rain shell, notebook, laptop, cables, and a water bottle and somehow it still keeps its clean shape. I don‚Äôt know what sort of geometry sorcery is going on, but it works. It doesn‚Äôt bulge or sag weirdly when loaded it  holds its shape, which I‚Äôve come to expect from the ballistic nylon they use.

**Rain & Weather Resistance**

One of the best things about this bag is that it‚Äôs basically impervious to the elements unless you‚Äôre diving into a pool. I‚Äôve carried this bag through a two-hour rainstorm, and everything stayed dry. Even though the zippers aren‚Äôt AquaGuard or anything, they‚Äôre sturdy and pretty rain-resistant. I didn‚Äôt see any moisture inside the bag or the pockets.

**Final Thoughts**

All in all, this is a lovely wee bag that has grown on me over time . It‚Äôs a truly versatile little number that I use at home for school runs, park runs, coffee runs ‚Äî even when I have to work on the go. But it‚Äôs during this trip that the bag really won me over",53,1752495878.0,ManyBaggers,12,0.96,False

Was reminded again today how sublime coffee beans are when properly loved and the Flair 58+ is the right heart for it. I have tasted the bitter disappointment that is modern cafe where the beans are akin to Ashy-tasting and lack any subtle nuances unless you count maybe volcanic minerals? ü§™

I used NaturalForce coffee beans and ground them up at a 8 using my Commandante. Puck it up and 8 second infusion followed by a 30-35 second pull. The results are a frothy Cr√®me and  one of the most beautiful brightness that hits my taste buds. It‚Äôs just a shot of sunshine in my mouth. There‚Äôs a subtle sweetness and when it‚Äôs pucked and pulled right, lacks any of the bitterness whatsoever. Amazing how different the taste is between something like a Cold Brew and this Condensation of Heavens Droplet. 

Here‚Äôs my Setup

Flair 58+ - Chosen for the heating element ensure a consistent water temp

Commandante - Money is worth every penny and very easy to adjust. I use 7-8 clicks

MATOW 58mm - use it to distribute and tamp, super easy to dial

Aivee Expresso Paper Filter 58mm - Helps with the very fine particles, trust me (just trust me bro) you definitely want a filter paper.

Oxo Gooseneck Kettle - Gets my temp right at 200 F the way I like it. 

I don‚Äôt use any of the needling as I don‚Äôt have a problem with static and don‚Äôt see any channelling in my pucks. The MATOW does a really good job of distributing the grind.

The Edinburgh Festival Fringe kicks off in three weeks. Scotland‚Äôs annual jamboree of extraordinary performance and existential despair is back.

There is not enough room here to delve into the complex, crazy ecosystem that is the Edinburgh Fringe. Fortunately,¬†[this enormous explainer I did for The Stage last summer is still largely accurate](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjr2YyB7bSOAxX5v4kEHX-zKZEQFnoECBkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestage.co.uk%2Flong-reads%2Fedinburgh-fringe-explained-what-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-worlds-biggest-arts-festival-really-works&usg=AOvVaw1VGwYhR587l8vYV9zDib3k&opi=89978449). There are a few key things to highlight about this year‚Äôs festival, though. Summerhall will exist,¬†[despite that looking unlikely a few months ago](https://thecrushbar.substack.com/p/shouts-and-murmurs-november-5-2024), and¬†[this guy on Interior Design Masters doing his best to ruin it](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002ch74).

The Crush Bar‚Äôs coverage of the Fringe will look much as it did last year. On Tuesdays and Fridays, starting next week, I will be sending out issues featuring brief round-ups of festival-related news and lists of five shows worth seeing. I will also, if you are interested, be covering the festival in The Stage, The Scotsman, and The Financial Times, as well as via various panels and radio programmes. I will, in short, be needing an awful lot of coffee. If you want to help on that front, you know what to do.

The Edinburgh Fringe is incredible, but it can also be intimidating for artists and audiences alike. For punters, the sheer scale can be overwhelming. For performers, the emotional, physical and financial toll of putting a show on can be challenging. Before it kicks off, then, I wanted to do something small that might make those stresses and strains easier to manage, so I asked some experienced Edinburgh Fringe folk for their best advice on surviving and thriving at the festival. Here is what they said‚Ä¶

# How do you work out what to see?

*I have a browse through the brochure and book new shows from artists whose work I have seen and admired before. After that, I listen to the grapevine and make sure my schedule is not too full, so that I can fit in any shows that are hot.*

*It is really hard. Before August, I browse the immense programme. Then, once I get to Edinburgh, I follow my instincts: an eye-catching flyer I stumble upon, an intriguing poster, word-of-mouth. At the Fringe, everything goes!*  
**Nicola Campostori,**¬†[***Black Blues Brothers: Let‚Äôs Twist Again!***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/black-blues-brothers-let-s-twist-again)

*I keep an eye out for old friends and favourites. I also love sitting down with the big brochure and a highlighter, as well as walking down the Royal Mile and seeing what pitches grab me. It‚Äôs all about taking risks and seeing what you stumble across. That‚Äôs how you find the gems.*  
**Emma Frankland,**¬†[***No Apologies***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/no-apologies)

*The first thing we do is check to see if Cat In The Hat is coming to the Fringe that year, and then we see everything else on a bit of a whim. It‚Äôs best not to think too hard, mainly because we need our brain capacity to focus on when we‚Äôre going to see Cat In The Hat*.**In B*****,***¬†[***Philosophy Of The World***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/philosophy-of-the-world)

# How do you attract audiences to your show?

*I really think a strong image and design is so important. When the image is strong and the design good, the show immediately looks professional and worth of attention. From there, well, basically, don‚Äôt be shit. Word-of-mouth is gold and if people are saying good things about your show, others will want to come and see it. I also do as many promotional slots as I can.*  
**Laura Corcoran,**¬†[***Frisky‚Äôs Reshuffle***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/frisky-s-reshuffle)

*We all worked so hard to build social media followings over the years, and that was all illusory. Now it is all monetised and governed by a mystical algorithm, it feels more like a lottery. So, I‚Äôm back to basics. Make great work. Talk to people.*  
**Christian Barry,**¬†[***Red Like Fruit***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/red-like-fruit)

*Word-of-mouth during the opening days of the run is vital. Check your venues papering comp policy before arrival, and distribute those comps to front-line customer service staff within your venue‚Äôs postcode at cafes and bars. That way, when those staff members inevitably get asked if they‚Äôve seen anything they would recommend, they pass on your show.*  
**Tom Forster,**¬†[**Summerhall Arts**](https://festival.summerhallarts.co.uk/)

*Wear your show merch 24/7. Title recognition and repetition is so important. You don‚Äôt want to miss the opportunity to embed the title of your show in someone‚Äôs subconscious.*  
**Blair Russell,**¬†[***Jackie!!!***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/jackie)

*Flyering still dominates at the Fringe. A few hours before the show, a nice walk around strategic points and near the box office has a significant impact on ticket sales.*  
**Nicola Campostori,**¬†[***Black Blues Brothers: Let‚Äôs Twist Again!***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/black-blues-brothers-let-s-twist-again)

*We take the paperless approach and don‚Äôt have any flyers. Now, we go out with poster boards, asking people to take a photo or scan a code, and the response has been brilliant.*  
**Noel Byrne and Antonia Christophers,**¬†[***1984***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/1984)

*You have to be real about what makes your show stand out. You wrote it and you‚Äôre also performing it? Cool, so are 1000 others. The show is about a real experience you had? So is half the Fringe. You have to take a step back and try to see what really makes your show worth seeing. Study other shows that you think have a similar target audience. See that show. Chat with that team. Maybe ask to exit-flyer their show. Ten good conversations when flyering is more valuable than 100 random strangers taking a flyer to get you to stop staring at them.*

# How do you keep costs down?

*I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs expensive. Book accommodation early. Book travel early. In the day-to-day, though, enjoy the ride, eat what you need, and sort out the credit card bills later.*  
**Christian Barry,**¬†[***Red Like Fruit***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/red-like-fruit)

*I don‚Äôt, really. I like to feel good and treat myself if I need to. Fringe is hard enough without denying myself little daily rewards.*  
**Jonny Woo,**¬†[***Jonny Woo: Suburbia***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/jonny-woo-suburbia)

*I‚Äôve become a maestro of meal prep. I do regular supermarket sweeps, then don my imaginary apron - diamond-encrusted Schiaparelli - and get chicken roasting, vegetables chopped and curries simmering. Then, I become Tupperware Tyra and divvy up dinners into colour-coded collapsible boxes.*  
**Peter Baker,**¬†[***Murder She Didn‚Äôt Write***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/murder-she-didn-t-write)

# How do you connect with industry?

*I don‚Äôt connect with industry. They connect with me. I love to schmooze, so often I will go to those weird events where an embassy or something invites people and you stand around and make industry small talk and eat free cheese. I genuinely really enjoy this.*  
**Trygve Wakenshaw,**¬†[***Monsterrrr! with Trygve Wakenshaw***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/monsterrrr-with-trygve-wakenshaw)

*At networking events. In bars. Through introduction by friends. Build your own network of friends and colleagues and be generous with your time, your information, and your praise. Treat the people that you already know as the most important. This will come back to you in magical ways.*  
**Wolfgang Hoffman,**¬†[**Aurora Nova**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwid1dqR7rSOAxWevokEHa80J2wQFnoECBgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.auroranova.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw1pzvPXdpuFgMzhPJKXF0_Y&opi=89978449)

*By spending time at the Traverse Theatre bar.*  
**Christian Barry,**¬†[***Red Like Fruit***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/red-like-fruit)

*Research, research, research. Get a list of arts industry members. See who is producing shows like yours. Send newsletters. Persevere with those you think are most interesting. If you don‚Äôt get a response, reach out to them on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn. Don‚Äôt be obsessive, but keep your goal in mind.*  
**Nicola Campostori,**¬†[***Black Blues Brothers: Let‚Äôs Twist Again!***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/black-blues-brothers-let-s-twist-again)

*Talk to everyone. Not literally everyone, but you know what I mean. Relish the melting pot. Talk to people you‚Äôre standing behind in queues, sitting next to at shows, waiting to cross the road with. You never know who you might meet. A new friend. A new enemy. Either way, it‚Äôs an anecdote waiting to happen.*  
**Ellie Keel,**¬†[***Skye: A Thriller***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/skye-a-thriller)

# How do you deal with disappointment?

*By never being disappointed. What I do is tons of fun for me. If you were a kid, playing on your favourite swing at the playground for an hour each day, what could get you down? Someone tells you that they didn't think that swing was as fun as you think it is? People didn't come watch you play on your swing? What does that matter? You just rode your favourite swing for an hour!*  
**Trygve Wakenshaw,**¬†[***Monsterrrr! with Trygve Wakenshaw***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/monsterrrr-with-trygve-wakenshaw)

*When it comes to disappointments I usually initially sulk hard for maybe an hour, then I will bitch to someone for a good five to 120 mins, just to get it out of my system, then, depending on the size of the disappointment, I will either go to the gym, go to a bar, go to a club, go to a drug dealer, or go to another country.*  
**Barnie Duncan,**¬†[***Barnie Duncan: Oooky Pooky***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/barnie-duncan-oooky-pooky)

*The best way to start is by having low expectations. That way, everything good that happens is a welcome surprise.*  
**Wolfgang Hoffman,**¬†[**Aurora Nova**](http://aurora%20nova/)

*The Fringe is an unparalleled opportunity for emerging companies to perfect their craft. At the end of Groundhog Day, Bill Murray could speak French, play the piano and ice-sculpt. If the script isn‚Äôt landing how you wanted, change it. Bring other artists that you‚Äôve met at the festival onto your stage for cameos. Grow it into something that would be impossible in any other setting.*  
**Tom Forster,**¬†[**Summerhall Arts**](https://festival.summerhallarts.co.uk/)

*Remember that it passes. Not everyone can like everything you do or agree with everything. Just because one person, one day, doesn‚Äôt like your show, it doesn‚Äôt mean the next day someone won‚Äôt love it. The arts are subjective. Try not to beat yourself up, as hard as it is.*  
**Chloe Nelkin,**¬†[**Chloe Nelkin Consulting**](https://www.chloenelkinconsulting.com/)

# How do you stay sane?

*I‚Äôve learned that giving myself breaks keeps my love for the Fringe strong and my brain sane. Walks in nature, visits to a gallery, a trip down to Portobello to look at the sea, a cup of cocoa with a book in a tucked-away caf√© off the beaten track: these are some of the things I find restorative.*  
**Peter Baker,**¬†[***Murder She Didn‚Äôt Write***](http://xn--murder%20she%20didnt%20write-4r5q/)

*Don't go it alone. Build your community support system of friends and other artists who you can be vulnerable with and share your experiences, both good and bad. In other words, get some good drinking buddies.*  
**Blair Russell,**¬†[***Jackie!!!***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/jackie)

*Get a really solid show routine. It helps to focus and gets all the craziness out of your head a little. Don‚Äôt get too obsessed with reviews, ticket sales, or promo. Remember to actually enjoy this incredible festival for a minute or two!*  
**Noel Byrne and Antonia Christophers,**¬†[***1984***](http://0.0.7.192/)

*You have to treat yourself as a professional and as an athlete. It is so easy to get caught up in the excitement of the the Fringe, to stay our for a drink every night, to see that 2am comedy show, to try and fit four of your friends‚Äô shows in before performing your own. The crazy Fringe experiences have theirplace, for sure, but we have found that the only way to stick it out the whole month as a performer is to remember that we are on the job.*  
**Xhloe and Natasha,**¬†[***What If They Ate The Baby***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/what-if-they-ate-the-baby)***?/***[***And Then The Rodeo Burned Down***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/and-then-the-rodeo-burned-down)***/***[***A Letter To Lyndon B Johnson Or God: Whoever Reads This First***](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/a-letter-to-lyndon-b-johnson-or-god-whoever-reads-this-first)

*The Fringe is exhilarating but can be overwhelming too. Don't let the fear of missing out drive your experience. Take breaks to properly digest what you've seen and felt. Remember you can't see everything or be everywhere, and that's okay. Artists, Fringe Central is your sanctuary for rest, development and support. Come find us. We would love to meet you.*

*I try to escape. I‚Äôm actually awful at taking this piece of advice, but it‚Äôs important to find moments for yourself. Cook a proper meal, visit the beach at Portobello, climb Arthur‚Äôs Seat - or Calton Hill if you want an easier walk - or get properly out of the city. There are some amazing places to visit only an hour away on the train.*
