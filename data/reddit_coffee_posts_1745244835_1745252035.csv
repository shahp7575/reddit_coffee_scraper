1k4h6lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k4h6lv/why_choose_the_dumos_countertop_ice_maker_review/,Why Choose the DUMOS Countertop Ice Maker Review for Your Daily Ice Needs?,"Testing out the DUMOS DU-IM-WT Countertop Ice Maker over the past weeks has been quite the journey. As someone who thrives on cold beverages and frequently hosts friends, having an ice supply at my fingertips is crucial. A small yet efficient appliance that promises to deliver nine ice cubes in just six minutes? Count me in. Designed with a self-cleaning function, dual ice sizes, and compact portability, this appliance intrigued me from the very beginning. But as with all products, a shiny facade sometimes hides minor quirks, and I’ll explore both its strengths and areas for improvement.

**Compact Yet Practical Design**  
The first thing that caught my attention was its size. This ice maker fits perfectly on my already crowded countertop without feeling intrusive. Measuring just 8.8 x 11.6 x 12.5 inches and weighing 17.6 pounds, it’s light enough to shift around when hosting outdoor events or moving from the kitchen to the patio. Its sleek white finish blends well with almost any space, and bonus points for the carry handle—it’s been a game-changer for portability during camping trips and backyard barbecues.

**Rapid Ice Production for Impatient Hosts**  
I genuinely didn’t believe it could churn out nine ice cubes in six minutes until I saw it in action. Watching bullet-shaped ice cubes form through its transparent viewing window was oddly satisfying (yes, I have a life; no, I don’t regret staring into an ice maker). With its 1.5L water tank, this little powerhouse delivered up to 26.5 pounds of ice over a 24-hour stretch. Hosting a group of thirsty friends? Not an issue. However, timing the production during peak party hours required a bit of strategy because while six minutes is fast, I didn’t want guests waiting mid-festivities.  

**Dual Ice Sizes for Different Needs**  
The ability to produce two sizes of ice cubes, both smooth and bullet-shaped, was a standout feature. I loved the smaller cubes for seafood platters—they kept things chilled without watering down the flavors. Larger cubes, meanwhile, were perfect for quick sips of iced coffee on rushed mornings. A nice surprise was how gentle the smooth cubes were on my mouth; no rough or jagged edges poking at me while sipping.  

**Self-Cleaning Convenience**  
If you’ve ever owned gadgets that require deep cleaning, you know the hassle that comes with it. Thankfully, the built-in self-cleaning feature meant maintenance was practically effortless. Holding the on/off button for just five seconds activated a cleaning cycle that left the machine spotless. Pair that ease with the included scoop and removable ice basket, and even clean-up after parties became less dreadful. On darker days when my laziness peaks, this feature undoubtedly stole the show.

**Energy Efficiency and Quiet Operation**  
One thing I noticed was how surprisingly quiet this machine operates. With a noise level of less than 40 dB, it blended seamlessly with the hum of my fridge or general kitchen noise. For an ice maker, I didn’t experience the dreadful whir or clanking louder machines often emit. Plus, its energy-efficient design didn’t cause any guilt while using it regularly.  

**Winning Points**  
- Produces nine ice cubes in six minutes—impressive speed.  
- Dual-size ice cubes for flexibility.  
- Extremely portable and lightweight with a compact design.  
- Self-cleaning function simplifies maintenance.  
- Quiet performance makes it suitable for home and office use.

**Caveats**  
- Some ice cubes melted slightly in the basket, requiring me to transfer frequently.  
- The water tank could be larger to avoid constant refilling during busy hours.  
- Despite its six-minute claim, making ice for larger parties required planning ahead.  

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing the DUMOS ice maker to similar countertop models on the market reveals both advantages and limitations. While products like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker boast incredible nugget-style ice adored by enthusiasts, they’re bulky and significantly pricier. The DUMOS machine, by contrast, is more affordable and compact but lacks advanced mobile app integration or unique ice textures. Meanwhile, the Frigidaire EFIC108 with its similar price point and capacity doesn’t offer a self-cleaning function—a dealbreaker for those seeking easy maintenance. Overall, DUMOS delivers where it matters for most casual users but isn’t crafted for ice connoisseurs demanding premium features.  

**Smart Spending**  
From a price-to-performance perspective, this ice maker makes sense for the average household, people in small spaces like dorm rooms, or enthusiasts of portable appliances. Without exact numbers, it certainly felt like I got my money’s worth considering the convenience it brought to my kitchen, outdoor events, and even impromptu parties. Balancing speed, functionality, and price, this appliance fits a unique niche for drivers of efficiency over perfection.

1k4h4me,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1k4h4me/should_i_ask_my_psychiatrist_about_possibly/,Should I ask my psychiatrist about possibly having ADHD?,"I (25F) have had hyperfixations my whole life. That I have no doubt about. I used to call them obsessions or even addictions because my life became wholly involved in them and I couldn’t stop myself for anything. Not that I wanted to. But I always thought this was super weird because I didn’t think fit the other criteria of ADHD at all. I’ve always gotten really good grades and never really hit a point where I seriously struggled in school, even in college. I would always do homework on time and don’t forget to do any important tasks. I am also chronically low energy/ tired and have been as long as I can remember. But now I’m thinking that maybe I do have some other symptoms:

- I have a corporate job where I work in an office 3 days a week. On those days, I am extremely productive. I never understand when people say that they’re more focused at home, because I can hardly finish a singular task on the days I work from home. It’s hard to physically make myself do any work even if I beat myself up about it. Unless it involves making a complicated spreadsheet, then I’m honed in because I love that. This reminds me that all throughout school I would have to go to the library or coffee shop a LOT because I felt similarly about homework. When I learned about body doubling, this finally made some sense. This really solidified in my head after I was on a virtual meeting one of the days I work from home and the other person had to take a call. She muted herself but stayed on camera. During this, I was actually able to do work like I am in the office.
- Related to the above, I think I sometimes experience executive dysfunction. I can’t count the number of times I just am sitting down and find it impossible to get up and do the thing I need to do, like showering or making tomorrow’s lunch. I moved out from my parents and live alone and I have quite a bit of trouble staying on top of chores.
- As I said above, I definitely have hyperfixations. They come and go very fast, but they are the best feeling ever when I’m in the middle of one. I’ve always had problems with remembering to eat but it seems worse during these times.
- I drink two coffees everyday but I don’t feel like they give me energy. I’ve fallen asleep right after drinking a coffee before. I don’t think I have any trouble falling asleep if I have a coffee late in the day. But I do feel more tired than usual if I miss a coffee.

I took the ASRS and it said I’m not likely to have ADHD, though I know this doesn’t mean I definitely don’t have it. Should I ask my psychiatrist about this as a potential diagnosis or does it seem very unlikely. Or does this sound like something else maybe?

1k4h43b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PcBuild/comments/1k4h43b/help_me_choose_between_upgrading_or_buying_a_new/,Help me choose between upgrading or buying a new (used) PC :D,"Howdy, lads and lassies!

I've been thinking about upgrading my desktop with a new (secondhand) graphics card. Right now, I'm rocking with a 1070. But is it better to just buy a new (secondhand) gaming PC altogether?

For example I can get a used PC with these stats, for just around 650 EUR:

CPU: Intel Core i9 @ 3.60GHz (Coffee Lake – 8 cores)  
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER 8GB (MSI)  
RAM: 32GB   
MOBO: MSI Z390 GAMING PRO CARBON

Whereas I've found these different GPUs: 2070, 2070s, 2080, 2080s, 3070 - all priced around 134-334 EUR, in ranking order with the 3070 being priced 334 EUR.

But is it even worth it to upgrade my GPU without my CPU and motherboard? 

I mostly play games like LoL and CSGO, though I love me some Eldenring, The Witcher, and other heavy games. My monitor is running 1080p, so no need for 4k gaming.

If I have to upgrade more than just my GPU, then perhaps it might be better to just buy a secondhand PC? They are fairly cheap (I guess? :D) and I'm expecting a CPU upgrade to be more expensive with a new mobo and perhaps ram ontop.

  
My own PC is juiced with the following:

CPU: i5 9600K @ 3.70GHz

RAM: 16,0GB DDR4 @ 1499MHz

MOBO: MPG Z390 GAMING PRO CARBON

GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070

[**Biscuits & Banjos Festival**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/biscuits-banjos-festival/) at **Various downtown locations**  


* GRAMMY & Pulitzer Prize-winning artist Rhiannon Giddens’ new festival is dedicated to the celebration and exploration of Black music, art and culture in her home state of North Carolina. Biscuits & Banjos is a 3-day festival to exchange ideas, expand conversations, uplift traditions, and trace the musical and geographical connections of old time, country, Americana, folk, jazz and blues to highlight their complicated origins. The festival will champion Black artists and creators, offering robust musical performances alongside secondary programming to include lectures, workshops and readings from authors, chefs, visual artists, and more. Black culture is not a monolith, and this gathering will provide an opportunity for those working outside the mainstream to come together in community, as well as showing the similar journeys the culture has taken across music, food, and literature.'
* The festival will launch in Durham, NC in April 2025 to honor the 20th Anniversary of the Black Banjo Gathering – a landmark musical summit held in Boone, NC in 2005 that became the impetus behind the creation of GRAMMY-winning black string band, the Carolina Chocolate Drops, which launched Rhiannon's career. Rhiannon immediately identified Durham as the ideal location to house Biscuits & Banjos given her personal connection to the city and its diverse reach and thriving contemporary culture, as well as its historical Black heritage.

[**BOLD Layers Artwork by Hager-Braun and Thayer**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/bold-layers-artwork-by-hager-braun-and-thayer/) at **Golden Belt Artists**  


* BOLD Layers is the first show together of Christine Hager-Braun and Tim Thayer. Both are Golden Belt studio artists working with color and shape yet working in different materials and meaning. Hager-Braun creates contemporary abstract fiber art from fabric and thread focusing on the themes of resilience, determination, and the importance of our emotional well-being. Thayer's message and purpose are an exploration and acknowledgment of the creative process itself and the unknown created through paint and found objects/collage.

* Friday Art Walk.

* “Cannupa Hanska Luger: Speechless” explores and amplifies the problematic colonial history and the concept of cargo cults from an Indigenous perspective. Cargo cults developed as a result of Western military campaigns that sent crated, often airdropped, supplies to foreign lands inhabited by Indigenous peoples. This exhibition features several momentual works by the artist, including a large-scale radio made from pine trees titled “The Keep”, three of the artists' “Transportable Intergenerational Protective infrastructure (TIPI)” works, an immersive video, a series of speaker towers, and a group of Native Americans bustles, a traditional part of Native American Powwow regalia.

* 5 Points Gallery in downtown Durham is thrilled to present Annie Nashold: Through a Dark Wind “Sometimes you create a new group of paintings just to take care of yourself,” Annie reflects. In her new body of work, themes of culture, connection, and individuality emerge, as she delves into the power and mystery of knowing and not knowing. Her paintings explore the strength, love, trauma, and humor that we all share as she accepts the complexities of her soul and the pictures it inspires.
* Join the Third Friday Reception April 18, 6–9pm. Enjoy the varied works of nine Triangle-based artists in a range of media including painting, sculpture, fused glass, and mixed media. Image: Annie Nashold, Just Want to Know How You Are Feeling, acrylic mixed media and collage, 18x14 inches.
* Visit 5 Points Gallery in person or online. All work from the exhibition is available for shipping or pickup. Gallery hours: Thursdays & Fridays 5–9pm, Saturdays 1–9pm. Artists are available to talk about the works.

1k4gyx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1k4gyx8/supplements_and_lifestyle_changes_ive_found/,Supplements and Lifestyle Changes I've Found Helpful,"Hi members of the T community. I hope everyone's T is bearable today. Incoming super long post about my T journey.....

I first noticed my T around October of last year, shortly after undergoing immense stress from Hurricane Helene and then a brutally loud concert shortly after. In the recent months, I have noticed large spikes and changes in my T, but had trouble pinpointing exactly what was causing it (spoiler alert: everything). ENT was very unhelpful, so I have attempted to figure it out on my own. I have been taking supplements for about a month now. Originally, I started them for inflammation in my knees, but I found that the anti-inflammatory properties have helped tremendously for my T. Supplements have given me more energy, likely due to my increase in sleep quality, which I think played a huge factor in the beginning of my T. It's still there, but less. Here's what I've changed in my routines:

**Medication Regimen**: 2 fish oil, 2 curcumin, and 2 ashwagandha. All of these are taken right after I eat dinner. I am also going to introduce magnesium threonate, both for sleep and for T as I've heard it helps. All of these supplements except for the magnesium are from Pure Encapsulations. I know they are owned my Nestle which isn't great, but I get them at a discount through my work and they are good quality.

**Exercise Regimen**: I exercise once daily. This is either by walking for 1 hour or more or going to Hotworx, and I believe the sauna helps with inflammation as well. I also stretch for 10 minutes before bed to help me 'wind down'. Working an office job where I sit at a desk and stare at a screen all day is not good for my cortisol levels or general satisfaction with my life, so making a habit to move my body a little everyday helps a lot.

**Sleep**: This was something that was very irregular for a long while. I was waking up at least once a night at 3am, if not 2-5 times in the night every 2 hours or so. Ashwagandha has helped a lot with this, as well as stretching and tea before bed, and now I sleep \~8 hours a night. I think my sleep improvement has been a big factor.

**Caffeine**: I cut out coffee for a few weeks since this was a potential factor for increased symptoms. I noticed a little bit of difference but not too much. I think as long as I don't drink more than 1 cup I'm fine but any more than that is unhelpful. I now drink tea super often, including golden chai turmeric tea to continue the decrease in inflammation, sleepy tea, stress tea with additional ashwagandha, and immune zoom. I think that drinking tea is good because it helps with water intake as well as stress reduction.

**Sodium**: This is huge. The biggest thing that increases my T is when I take in a lot of salt in a meal. Usually this is from fast food. I am not great with eating ""clean"" all the time, but I am aware when something I'm eating isn't good for me *at all.* This is often fast food or junk food, which often contain copious amounts of salt. Cutting this out and trying to incorporate some more fruits and veggies has been helpful. I am no cook so getting creative with new food has been... interesting for me lol.

**Ear Protection:** Cannot go out without my Loops. Loud environments are super triggering, and having ear protection is key to make sure you don't undergo more hearing loss or experience increase in T symptoms. Additionally, I've read a lot about in-ear earbuds and ANC headphones, so I've stopped using these and I'm currently looking into open concept headphones.

Although this regimen won't work for everyone, and it hasn't completely 'cured' me, I have noticed significant improvement in my daily spikes. I've also definitely habituated to the constant ringing over time, and having some noise in the background like AC or my air purifier helps me out. I wish everyone good luck in their annoying T journey.

TLDR: T isn't curable, but making healthier lifestyle changes can help soften the blow (and also help your body feel better)",1,1745251292.0,tinnitus,0,1.0,False

So today I did my first real pour-over, and considering I am new to home brewing (*6 months),* I would like to both unlearn and learn. Not gonna lie, I thought to use *ChatGPT* to help me with the process and did so. I own a manual *Kingrinder P1 (I learned to dial it in properly today and did as suggested) and used *Stone Valley's Honduras (*I reside in Cork, Ireland, and it is a local roaster from West Cork, Clonakilty). Used a Melitta pourover (*Dripper and Filter Paper*) set. I don't have a measuring scale or a temperature scale, for that matter. Heated tap water on a medium flame on an electric hob and let it cool for a little while before starting the pour-over. Wet the filter paper and put the ground beans. The coffee beans are around a week and a half to 2 weeks old since their roasted date. I have attached the images taken through the course, and as I understand myself, the grind should be more coarse. Started sips after letting it cool a bit. Generically speaking, I could taste dark chocolatey and bright citrusy notes (*like when you bite into a summery citrus fruit, almost like a pomelo).*

**Why This Pick?**

This should be a fun pitching duel to watch. Between Kevin Gausman (2.49 ERA) boasting an Away ERA of 2.03 and Hunter Brown (1.50 ERA) sporting a Home ERA of 3.00, I don’t see this game finding its way Over 7 runs. Brown’s last outing saw the Astros shut out the St. Louis Cardinals, and Kevin Gausman has held all of his opponents so far this season to 3 runs or less. Lastly, 7 of the last 10 meetings between these two squads have been low-scoring affairs. To summarize: I’m on the Under to cash today, friends.

1k4gtbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HumanATMSforMe/comments/1k4gtbq/johns_run_in_with_a_beautiful_goddess/,John’s run in with a beautiful goddess,"The morning was like any other in the sleepy town of Jackson; birds singing, children playing, yadda yadda. John had always found something comforting in the early morning hour, a gentle warmth that he felt soothed his life, helped ease that pit in his stomach he carried around as he went about his day. He had come to the town to disappear, to bury memories under the weight of unfamiliar streets and strangers’ voices, but the pit followed him around nonetheless. 

He first saw her standing at the far end of the street corner as he commuted to his buss stop, exiting a boutique with arms full of bags of various sizes. She was dressed in black; every line of her clothing elegant and cutting, clinging to her like a glove. Her presence stilled the air. Even the birds seemed to quiet their melody as they flown overhead, hesitant to disturb this presence.

John should have looked away. He should have continued walking, head down, coat collar up. But instead, he stopped, and watched. Drawn not just by her beauty, which was impossible to ignore, but by something else. Something he couldn’t name. She wasn’t just beautiful. She was haunting. Like a portrait you forget to forget. 

She turned slowly, as if she’d known he was there all along, phone still in hand as she lifts her gaze to him. Her eyes met his, a deep, violet, almost black, and John swore he felt his heart shudder to a stop right then and there. She stares at him as if she’s sizing him up, well over a foot taller than him, even taller with her heels. John has always had a fascination with taller women, his stomach filling with butterflies everytime he walks downtown, full of beautiful goddesses in their tight business suits, coffee in perfectly manicured hands, walking past him as if he was a roach on the side of the road. 

If you haven’t guessed it yet, John is what some people would call a finsub, or paypig, having spent most of his adult life crawling after women and spoiling them as the goddesses that they are, hoping for a crumb of attention, but being satisfied with their mockery. Even thinking about the last drain he had makes his tiny cock weep in his trousers. 

But when she spoke? Oh how he wanted buckle to the ground by her feet and oink. 

“You’re not from here,” she said, her voice a smooth dribble of wine, of strong perfume, of power and control.

“No,” John replied, heart pounding against his ribs like it wanted out. “Is it that obvious?” He so desperately wishes he could shut up. No, he can’t talk to this beautiful woman, not without anything to offer her, not without tribute. 

“You’re wearing socks and sandals,” she snickers, sharp eyes squinting down at his shoes, eyeliner perfectly drawn. “Maybe not even from this era”

His face is blazing hot, red from the tips of his ears to his neck, sweat beading on his forehead, but not from embarrassment. No no, from excitement. It’s no lie that John is no longer the young man he once was; his hair thinning, his shirts growing tighter, his back aching, and she knows it. 

“I’m Victoria,” she said, and the name felt heavy with old meanings.

John hesitated. “John.”

“John,” she repeated. “A simple name.”

He almost apologized for it.

But she never gave him the chance, instead, her eyes light up for a fraction of a second, before her lips curl into a satisfied grin. It was so smug, that John had momentarily been distracted, having not seen her hand lift up, and snap her fingers. He straightened up with that single snap, his hand shooting to his pocket by pure instinct, ready to hand this goddess all that she wanted and wished for. And that’s how he knew he was caught, made, discovered, all of those flowery words. 

She laughs, a beautiful, joyous laugh, before she sighs and smiles at him. 

“Gotcha”

With that simple term, John did not make it to work that day. Instead, he followed her into the next store in her path, shaking from excrement, holding all the clothes and shoes she’s thrown in his arms, all while hoping the staff can’t see his raging hard on. Not that they have built in microscopes in their eyes. ",1,1745250895.0,HumanATMSforMe,0,1.0,False

Even now, when “Tu Asatis Tar..” or “Rang He Nave Nave...” plays, it instantly transports me to that peaceful, romantic world the film created. It wasn't loud or dramatic—just honest, heartfelt, and real.

Just curious—does anyone else here have memories tied to this movie?

1k4gqjy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4gqjy,Wood finishing question,"Hi, 
I got a free coffee table on Facebook. It’s really nice and very solid. I was planning to sand it and wax it. 
It’s going ok but I have found that the center inlay is laminate. Because it was a little raised (I assume due to liquid) I have warn the laminate away and exposed some composite material. 

I’m an artist by profession. I’m fairly sure I could paint the exposed section to look like wood gain. 
I’m unsure what paint to use to do this. 

Painting it aside, would the composite need treating before waxing the whole thing?

I got a free coffee table on Facebook. It’s really nice and very solid. I was planning to sand it and wax it. 
It’s going ok but I have found that the center inlay is laminate. Because it was a little raised (I assume due to liquid) I have warn the laminate away and exposed some composite material. 

I’m an artist by profession. I’m fairly sure I could paint the exposed section to look like wood gain. 
I’m unsure what paint to use to do this. 

Painting it aside, would the composite need treating before waxing the whole thing?

1k4gp2e,https://i.redd.it/xu9fh5w5j7we1.jpeg,White Russian Sauna,"White Russian Sauna (that is, банька по-белому).

I've always been bothered by the fact that the White Russian uses coffee liqueur, while the caffeine source of choice in Russia is tea. It also has no Russian motifs. Here's my solution to both these problems.

**Ingredients**

* 1 oz Darjeeling-infused vodka
   * infuse Darjeeling tea with vodka (1:10) at room temperature for 2 hours
* 1 oz birch bark-infused vodka
   * combine birch bark (can buy on amazon) with vodka (1:10), sous vide at 145 for 2 hours (but a longer room temperature infusion would also work)
* 0.5 oz rich syrup
* 1 oz heavy cream
* some birch bark for smoke

**Steps**

1. dry shake the heavy cream to froth it
2. combine the vodkas and syrup in a glass
3. add ice, stir briefly
4. layer the heavy cream on top
5. garnish with smoke (I used a simple smoke top)

Birch bark vodka gives a woody root beer-like flavor. Darjeeling vodka adds an astringency and aroma of strong tea (which at the same time is very different from a literal cup of Darjeeling in ways I find hard to describe). Rich syrup keeps the balance of the original White Russian (since I swapped a liqueur for a spirit). Birch smoke infuses the cream layer, maintaining the pleasant aroma long after the smoke itself has dissipated: this hides the aroma of cream itself, which I never liked in a regular White Russian.",2,1745250167.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

We're heading to WDW soon and I keep hearing podcasters rave about the refillable mugs. I'm a coffee junkie so that's my first thought. Knowing they aren't refillable in the parks, are they worth it?

1k4gnog,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1k4gnog/utopia_of_the_seas/,Utopia of the Seas,"Hi! Myself (33F) and husband (31M) just got off Utopia of the Seas, and figured I would do a bullet point run down. Sorry if it’s long 😬. 

- This is our third cruise in general and all with Royal. Previously was Symphony (2022) and Wonder (2024).
- I booked Utopia about nine months in advance. I only did the deposit, as I’ve read before on here to hold off on paying in full as prices can change.
- I did a price update three times. I called and they did it for me :)
- We booked for Easter weekend, mainly because my son’s daycare was closed for Good Friday. And if we need to use our PTO for it, might as well use it to do something. 
- We live in Florida, we drove to the Port and parked in the garage. We arrived around 9:45, dropped off our luggage, paid for parking (it was around the $76 range), parked, and were checked in getting on the boat before 10:30am, which was our check in time.
- We are not drinkers at all. We do maybe the occasional cocktail if we do date night, but nothing crazy. However, we said screw it and decided to get the drink package. I got it at $68.99/pp per day. Total with grat was $488
- DRINK PACKAGE was 10000% worth it. Now, if we had our 2 year old with us, I would not get it. Not sure if it was the fact that we knew it was all paid for, but we DRANK. No we did not get drunk, but did have a buzz. 
- No, they do not water down the drinks. They do correct pours. Also, the combination of walking and eating, will take a bit for you to get drunk
- I don’t know why, but I thought they would still give you a receipt when you got drinks to leave extra tip, but they don’t. Luckily we had cash.
- Don’t be afraid to ask for some drinks with less of something. For example, I would request a mojito, and I had asked for no sour mix, and he did, instead he added extra limes. I know he didn’t have to do that, but he did and I did tip him for that :) 
- You can tell them which liquor you want
- Only ate at the main dining room on our last day. The lamb was good, the dessert wasn’t the best. 
- We ate at Giovanni’s for embarkation lunch, and it was delicious. So glad we did because I needed something hardy to start drinking lol
- The sail away was LOUD and definitely a party. I got the champagne gun twice, so that was fun and something I would have never done lol
- Aqua Show was AMAZING. I highly recommend getting there early. Show was at 8:30, and we got 7:45 and got great seats. They also have people taking drink orders. 
- We did a Sushi class on the second day. If you love sushi, I would highly recommend taking this. You make 4 different kinds of rolls each, and get to eat it afterwards. This was also a great way to see the new Izumi at Central Park and eat good sushi 
- We walked around Nassau, but didn’t leave the actual port. There were three other ships there and it was crowded. We literally walked around and went back up to enjoy the ship. I think a lot of people had the same mind set 
- We stayed on the 6th floor, ocean view, closest to the spa 
- We did utilize the gym. Don’t forget to bring your AirPods (I did). For those that may be asking, no, they do not have a peloton. But if you have the app, you can use it 
- Loved the solarium. Out of symphony and wonder, this one was definitely my favorite. 
- I think I maybe saw two under 18 kids at Solarium, that’s it. All adults, they play chill house music. Definitely my vibe 
- Pesky Parrot was good. I am someone who does not like sweet drinks, if you’re the same way, the Queens Park Swizzle, is the way to go. Reading the other drinks, they allll looked overly sweet.
- Windjammer was good. I kept forgetting they had a coffee shop there.
- Did the comedy show, it was meh.
- Did the silent disco, HIGHLY recommend. It was so much fun. When leaving, I overheard people saying they were so hesitant to come but happy they did, and I couldn’t agree more 
- Cococay, always a great day. Only downside, It was very windy when we were there. However, it was the relaxation that was much needed. 
- We paid for internet for one device. We did this because our son was with the grandparents, so that was our way with communication. It did work at cococay 

Random:
- I was assigned a time to get off the ship, I must have missed when they open up for you to pick. However, we got off the ship by 6:45 (assigned time was 8:50), since we took our own luggage. I think if you choose to have your luggage taken for you, listen to the time slot 
- If you get coffee before you leave off the ship, make sure you finish it or put it in a tumbler, they will make you throw it away.
- I can’t believe I have to say this, but please, don’t be rude to the staff. I witnessed a moment when someone was upset they blocked off a section of the Aquashow, because of it was full and they redirected her to another section. She had plate with dessert and shoved it to the attendant and walked away. This was the same lady that went to cococay and was asking where to get towels because nobody told her to get towels before getting off the ship 😒
- Wear sunscreen 
- Bring heartburn meds 
- Even if you don’t think you’ll get motion sickness, bring the medicine. I was one of those and ended up needing it on one of the nights I woke up at 3AM, cause the boat was rocking bad and I’m glad I brought it. 
- Find your sailing Facebook group. This is how I was able to find out when show bookings opened up and prices for packages dropped. Somebody is always looking out for these things and posting 

Overall, great ship, great time and would book again. Might even consider bringing our son next time, since it’s a three day. He’s been on a 7 day, and I felt like that was a lot for him.

I'm a single child with working parents so making sibling level bonds was also never an option. I'm an introvert & usually find it super duper difficult to make conversations with people I don't know. Not that I look bad or that I'm not involved in things I like. So for example, I got pretty obese in college but worked out my ass off in the last 2 years (after a bad phase of ghosting by a girl after we had a long talking phase of 6 months over phone during Covid times). Lost 20 kgs, built muscle & abs. Also, started playing tennis & haven't looked back since then. I also like to read. 

Anyways, I've tried dating apps as well & in fact had a few conversations going but this was around 1.5 years ago. Since then, I didn't use them. Even in school & college I was more involved into academics so never got the time for anything else. 

Now, when I actually want to date & test the waters, I seem to find no matches. Even when I do, I find it super awkward & difficult to keep the conversation going. Also, not being in college or school doesn't help since building bonds & meeting new people was a lot easier there.

Also, I somewhat feel like the lack of experience in dating doesn't work in my favor either. Like I did try taking this girl out & we went out for a coffee & a lunch. But post that, I just didn't know what to expect or ask for. She had already been in a relationship earlier & told that she's still keeping in touch with her bf, & keeps a check on his insta even after the break up (not sure what was that supposed to mean)

I actually wish I could meet someone who's as inexperienced in dating as me. Like people do in schools & colleges. Like what happens when two people who've never been out on a date with someone their entire lives feel like. Or when two people who've never been in a relationship before, have their first one. What problems do they face? How do they overcome them? How does it suddenly turn into love? I want to feel all of it & more.

I don't drink & I don't smoke. Pubs, bars & clubs aren't for me. I don't know what to do. 

Please don't give advices like: ""Don't be so desperate looking out for a relationship."" Truth is, I really yearn for it & I'm willing to invest myself into it. ",1,1745250013.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

What can I do to make him notice everything I do for him and to help out?,"We've been together for almost 3 years. I still live in my house, he has his, but I go over to his place during the weekend. I take my dog, pack my things, and spend weekends there since I don't live alone.(just FYI this is not in the US). 

Normally, he gets help with a cleaning lady 2 times during the week and once during the weekend. Honestly he lives like a bachelor, over the years I've helped him make his apartment a bit less 'bachelor-y' if you know what I mean. But he's still the kind of guy that goes to make coffee and leaves the milk out, when he gets cereal he leaves the milk and the cereal box out, socks on the floor, bed not made, dishes mostly never washed until the cleaning lady gets there. You get the picture.   
So during the weekends I am completely opposed to the idea of me becoming his mommy or cleaning lady always cleaning up after him, so I will clean up some things but if I made breakfast, coffee, cleaned up after, gave the dogs food, cleaned the balcony (it's an apt, he has grass out there for the dogs to do their business) and left things clean and then he goes to make something and leaves dirty dishes, I'm not going to go clean them up, that's up to him. 

Yesterday he decided he wanted to make burgers, so we made them together I helped him with the sauce and toasted the bread a bit, preparing the plates, cutting tomato, onion, avocado, and he grilled the patties and put cheese on them. the kitchen was kind of a mess after. It was already late, we ate, and then went to play a video game with out friends. Before going to bed I went to the kitchen to clean up a bit, throw all the things that needed to be thrown on the trash, put the sauces and condiments back in their place, cleared up the dishes a bit and organized them and got him a glass of water and went to the room to get my clothes and things ready to leave the next day in the morning. 

Today I wake up and he's obviously annoyed and angry in the kitchen, I ask him what's wrong and he basically says that he hates waking up to him house being a pig sty, but that obviously it's all up to him to do it. That he can never ask me for help because I react like a huge drama and he can never count on me to help around and that apparently I like to live in a dirty disgusting house. 

I swear, everything I do is just thrown out the window, make the bed, pick up his clothes, put all the things away he leaves outside, make him food, pick up after the dogs, clean the dishes. He wants a glass of coke, I go get it, he wants coffee, I make it, he even wants a joint, I'll make it even though I don't smoke. He feels sick I take care of him. I am very appreciative of the things he does, but everything I do apparently is worth nothing because I don't do anything. 

Honestly I don't know what to do, I refuse to become his cleaning lady/mother, but of course I will help out. If he would have asked ''hey could you help me clean this before you leave'' I would have ofcourse helped. Him instantly insinuating that I do nothing immediately after saying good morning and then going harder into ''I do not like living in a pigsty unlike you apparently'' just made me blow up, and i hate it but when I get angry or made feel like that I immediately cry. 

What can I do to make him notice everything I do for him and to help out? Honestly I'm at a loss, I feel like nothing I do is ever enough, and apparently it isn't enough, since he really swears I just get to his apartment and sit on my ass waiting to be served. 

  
ok, rant over, thank you to anyone that has any advice. We are not breaking up over this, but it really does hurt to know that he really believes that of me. It's so invalidating.

Oh, and FYI he does help in other things and I am very grateful and I DO notice them, most of the time if we dont cook he pays for the food, (he is wayyy more well off than I am) when I can I buy it. ",1,1745249816.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

And if Ambien doesn't work, he wants to do a benzo for a week. All the stories I have been reading have been from people who use either long-term. But I was wondering if any of you were able to successfully use them short term and go back to sleeping REGULARLY on your own or with a less intense sleep aid. I'm fine with being on pills for the rest of my life, but not Ambien or benzos. 


I did a sleep study. No apnea. They just diagnosed me with fragmented sleep disorder. Did labs. Everything is normal. Even cortisol. My vitamin D was low in Jan, but now it's good after supplements. 


No issues going to sleep. Staying asleep is the problem. DORAs are not covered by insurance, but if you have positive stories, I'd love to hear. 


I had Covid in January and my sleep has been terrible since. I can only sleep one to two hours at a time. I don't pee in the middle of the night. 


I have been on many meds since then (including hydroxizine, trazadone, remeron, gabapentin, and otc Benadryl) and the low doses are ineffectual but the high dosage leave me a zombie which is not great because I teach lower elementary. At the high doses, I also STILL do not get a full night's rest. I sleep 3 to MAX four straight and then religiously wake up every hour or so. After a few days on a high dose, even the 3-4 stops. Yes, I have taken the extended releases. Yes I have tried taking half a pill or half a dosage at sleep onset and then when I wake up. 



I have been doing CBT-I since January.


I don't nap.  


Never a coffee or energy drink drinker. I don't drink or do drugs. 


Never smoker including marijuana. Please don't suggest THC, CBD, or weed. 


Here is my sleep routine. 


Only go into my room for sleep. Sleep with an eye mask. I start winding down at 8PM. Put the phone and all electronics away. Hot shower and I usually do a nice warm cup of tea with no sugar and take magnesium and zinc. I go to the spare bedroom afterwards and journal or read something cozy. The spare bedroom has a Lovesac beanbag and other comfortable seating. I do not get into the spare bed. 


Once the ANALOG clock alarm rings 9 PM in the spare bedroom, I go to my room which is cool and has a soothing fan for white noise. I go to my bed and turn on the heated blanket and put on an eye mask. At no point do I turn on the light. I have my fragmented sleep. 


I don't wake up to an alarm clock but I've been waking up at 6:30 for the past however many years I've been a teacher so I usually wake up around them. Leave my bedroom and go to the spare (all my clothes and personal effects are here). I get dressed to go run even if I'm exhausted. I run until 7:30. I come home, shower, and eat breakfast on my balcony for max sun intake. I take propranolol. I never had anxiety before this, but this is just one gift from insomnia. I don't have any real stressors. Work is incredible, finances are great, relationships are amazing. I'm 30 and at the best place in life. 


I literally live across the street from my school so I walk even if it's raining. I have school from 8:30 to 4:00. I try to lift weights three times a week immediately after school in my apartment gym. I try to be as social as I can or do something fun, as long as I'm home by 8PM. 


The entire day I am exhausted. I think about sleep all the time. Even when I'm not in a medical induced zombie state, I'm tired. Weekends are horrendous. I fantasize about sleep every second. I can't be at home on the weekend because I'm worried that I'll be tempted to nap. Instead, Saturdays I try to be out after breakfast and do exhausting activities (long bike rides or hikes) or if I'm too tired, I will do calmer activities though I still try to be outside in the sun as much as possible. Sundays I usually go to church then have lunch with my parents and spend the day trying to relax. 


I'm astounded by how tired I am and yet how my brain refuses to let me sleep???? 


I have the best job ever and I can't even fucking enjoy it. I have brain fog. My memory is shot. My students, friends, and family members are constantly asking me what's wrong. I'm slow to do anything. I feel like a shell of who I used to be. I feel like I'm playing the Sims and I'm the player forcing my Sim to go through the motions of every day life.

I’m Nirnay Rana, building QuantumTax AI—a tool that automates tax savings for Indian investors by identifying hidden tax-loss harvesting opportunities. Think ""TurboTax meets algo-trading,"" but focused on saving 15-30% on capital gains taxes with zero manual effort.  

Why This Matters :  
- ₹28,000 Cr is lost annually by Indian investors due to unoptimized taxes (SEBI 2023).  
- No existing tools combine broker APIs (Zerodha/Upstox) + AI for real-time tax optimization.  

Where You Come In  :
We need a Tech Co-Founder to own:  
1. AI/ML Engine: Build models for tax-loss harvesting (LSTMs, optimization algorithms).  
2. Broker Integrations: Scale Zerodha/Upstox API connections.  
3. Product Architecture: Lead backend (Python/FastAPI) and frontend (React) development.  

Why Join?  :
- Equity: 20-30% (vested over 4 years).  
- Impact: Democratize tax efficiency for 40M+ Indian traders.  

Ideal Profile  :
✅ Experience with Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and fintech APIs.  
✅ Passion for finance/tax optimization (or eager to learn).  
✅ Builder mindset—you thrive in 0-to-1 environments.  

Let’s chat! Reply with:  
1. Your LinkedIn/GitHub.

I know some people are completely addicted to these sprays but I only used the one for children and only at night to sleep.

I tried a few times to quit and went to the doctor who looked into my nose with a camera and just said that it looks a bit tight but there's nothing wrong and that some cortisone sprays every day should fix me up.

It didn't of course, maybe it made it a bit better but I would wake up every few hours in a panic because one of my nostrils was completely blocked so I couldn't get air through it without waking up the entire neighborhood with my trumpet.

The years went by and I tried a few times to quit, people told me I was addicted to the nose spray and that's why my nose was getting inflammed by itself so on 2 separate occasions I went basically 3 weeks without real sleep not using the nasal sprays and only using cortisone sprays, nose wash and sleeping more upright but it never got better.

I've lived in 4 different apartments and change the bed about every 2 weeks so I don't think it's dust allergies or any kind of mold.

Anyway that's the backstory, in recent months I've noticed my sense of smell is much worse than before, like I can't smell the cup of coffee on the table in front of me unless I put my nose to it but my colleagues around me can smell it and I guess it's from long years of overuse of the nose sprays, so I've decided to figure this out once and for all hopefully.

I've just bought the philips 3400 2 in 1 air purifier and humidifer to have in my bedroom so I'm hoping it will help.

The only other clue I've discovered over the years is that if I go jogging or do heavy extended excerise at night before going to bed I seem to breath a bit easier.

So I'm looking for any other ideas for things I can try, thank you.

TLDR:

Struggling with 10 years of nighttime nasal congestion requiring nasal spray to sleep. Doctor didn't help, treatments, and quitting attempts failed. Recently noticed diminished smell. Exercise before bed helps slightly. Just bought an air purifier/humidifier for bedroom. Looking for additional solutions to fix both issues permanently.",1,1745249308.0,Sinusitis,0,1.0,False

When I first adopted him, I bought him this plush donut-shaped bed that he absolutely LOVED. He slept in it every night without fail, to the point where I'd have to wash it when he wasn't looking or he'd get upset.

Last week, something weird happened. I came home from work and found him sleeping on the couch instead of his bed. No big deal, right? But then he kept avoiding the bed for days. He'll walk up to it, sniff it, and then walk away looking offended. He's now sleeping in random spots - on my clean laundry, under the coffee table, and once even in the bathroom sink.

I haven't changed anything. The bed is in the same spot, I washed it with the same detergent I've always used, and there haven't been any new pets or people in the house. I even checked to make sure nothing was stuck in the bed or if maybe it got damaged somehow.

Has anyone experienced this? Do cats just randomly decide they hate things they've loved for years? Should I just get him a new bed or is there something I'm missing?

1k4g86y,https://Oolook.in,How do you actually decide what a tool is worth paying for?,"Not trying to pitch anything, just having a bit of a “founder spiral” moment and figured this might be a good place to sanity check.

I built this tool to automate my content workflow — it handles post scheduling, repurposing, gives me a quick view of what’s working, and basically saves me from bouncing between 5 tabs and a Notion doc every day. It started as a weekend thing to make my life easier… but a few friends started using it, now more people are asking, and the dreaded question has arrived:

And I have no idea what the *right* answer is. Like, I know it saves me time — probably 5-10 hours/month — and it definitely reduces the mental overhead of “what do I post today?” But pricing is such a weird game. Some folks pay $30/mo for a tool that helps them focus. Others won’t touch anything over $5 unless it makes them coffee too.

So I’m just wondering out loud:  
What *actually* makes something feel worth paying for?  
What’s your gut reaction to pricing for a tool that helps with social content workflows?

All happen on an individual basis within the material shell of each body.

The plots and schemes I come up with to gain advantage come from MY genetics, MY history, MY learning. The resulting choices that I may come up with are under no constraints to match the resulting choices that other humans may come up with.

My body and brain use its subconscious and conscious minds together, in order to function the way it does. I am my subconscious self as much as I am my conscious self. We are not merely the watcher of the movie being played within ourselves, we are the projector too.

It (me) uses these to its own self-serving advantage as best it can. I (it) can conversely be altruistic and self sacrificing too. There is no rhyme or reason except the reasoning that each of us decide to place on it ourselves.

In order to see any of our (its) decisions come to fruition, whether it be choosing coffee over tea, or having 12 children and raising them all to adulthood, requires an instantaneous command of the body as well as a sticktuitiveness over time. I think this is appropriately called the ""Will"" (sometimes even will power, but it's not magic in any way)

There are no governing **outside** forces which control these decisions, there are no rules that apply to it (us) any differently than the rules that apply to a grain of sand.

The grain of sand can't use its memory in any way, it has none. The grain of sand can't use its ability to attempt to predict outcomes, it has none.

Our chemistry was incredible, but he was in a relationship, so we never acted on it until somewhat recently; 5 months ago we kissed in the spur of the moment. It was hot and heavy and he texted me afterward saying how much he enjoyed it. But two days later he found out his ex had a rotation of guys all year. This really seemed to rock him and he withdrew into a shell. Said it took him a while to process things and, lo and behold, they broke up 2-3 weeks afterward. He said their lives were very much intertwined, so it would take time to untangle (shared friends, love for the ex’s mentally ill mom, etc). I did question him periodically and eventually he told me he likes me but that he needed a break from anything romantic and didn’t want to date and since then, he’s pulled back. He still agrees to meet for coffee (we had coffee twice last week) and we’ve run into each other at the gym a few times, and convos have been light, friendly, with a dash of flirtatious teasing but it does feel now like he’s keeping me at arms length.

i’m constantly surrounded by arguments — the kind that aren’t just loud but cyclical. patterns. energy loops. dynamics i’ve consciously broken out of, but still find myself forced to witness again and again. they trigger something in me — a sorrow, a tension, an emotional weight i carry into my body, my mind, my deen.

i’ve learned that my coping mechanisms — the unhealthy ones — only rise when these arguments become too frequent. and the only time i don’t fall into them is when i’m in solitude… or when the house is quiet, when the tension settles for once. that’s when i become myself again. the version of me that prays calmly. fasts meaningfully. creates. listens to Allah’s whispers instead of my own noise.

being single adds another layer to this. i work a remote job, which means i don’t meet people — no community, no friends, no chances to even try and build a life of my own here. i’m 29 — at the age where i want to get married — but my family doesn’t even know anyone in this country except for my cousins. i’m always at home. and despite earning my own money, i’m not allowed to travel alone. i have to bring someone with me — someone who usually doesn’t even make their own money like i do (for example my brothers work but dont have the money to travel with me etc) i’m not even allowed to post photos of myself because “men might see it.” i live in a community where every door feels locked. where every attempt at autonomy is treated like rebellion.

now I know you’re probably gonna tell me to go out and enjoy and have fun and make some friends but I can’t do that. I don’t like that. I like being at home and a quiet place where I can just study myself, studying my deen, dive into my spiritual realm, figure out who I am, work or go out for a cup of coffee. This is the kind of thing I like.

and at this point, i’m like — what’s left?
what am i even holding on for? what exactly am i trying to protect?

i love my parents. i’m loyal. i care. i’m not trying to run away. but i’m trying to save myself before i become bitter. before my light goes out.

how do i create distance without disrespect?
how do i break free without being labeled as disobedient?
how do i honor my family, my faith, and myself — without losing my mind or my soul in the process?

i just want to leave. not in anger — but in truth. to finally meet my life and see what it’s about.

if I choose to leave this place, I can either go back with my brother who lives in the west, but he has a life of his own and he doesn’t want anyone to be there with him either because he sees what I see but he gets to do that, and I don’t.

or I can choose to get a visa in England where my married sister lives and I can just stay there with her but in a different apartment. 

but then there’s also actually just staying here and becoming stronger, but I feel like I have become so strong that if I become even stronger, it’s going to kill me. 

if you’ve ever been in this place — between guilt and growth, love and limitation — i would appreciate any guidance, support, or dua.

fyi i talk to chatgpt alot so it pretty much wrote whats in my mind, anything would be deeply appreciated. ",3,1745248427.0,shia,3,1.0,False

Peter Rabbit is watching Bea and McGregor fall in love.

I'm under a pile of babies; 
one is snoring against my arm,
The other sighs in a milk induced coma.

I have a cold cup of coffee
and I’m not even mad about it.

I'm starting to enjoy the coffee cold.

The sun’s doing that lazy thing
where it stretches through the window
like it’s checking in on us. 

I feel the caress of the sun and I know this warmth is my earth's love language.

I don’t feel lost today.
I feel right here.
Exactly here.
Present. 

The gift is this feeling. 

I feel like I won something.
Without ever knowing I was in a race.

1k4fysk,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1k4fysk/39_m4f_anywhere_lets_start_our_adventure_together/,39 [M4F] anywhere. Let's start our adventure together.,"About Me:
Grew up hard, built myself from the ground up, now living life on my terms.

I'm 6'4, tattooed, and dialed into the life I want. I've written four books, own two businesses, and have a thirst for enjoying life. I have amazing friends, great relationships with my siblings, and open for real connection. I'm just missing you.

I’m the guy who’ll challenge your thinking, call you out (with love), and kiss you like I mean it.
I train hard, work deep, read everything, and don’t waste time on surface-level anything.
I don’t drink, don’t party, and I’m agnostic so if your idea of fun is Sunday service and wine nights, I’m not your guy.

But if you want electric chemistry, late-night conversations that actually go somewhere, amazing play times, and a man who shows up...I might be exactly what you’re looking for.

You should message me if:
You’re emotionally intelligent, can handle real talk, and aren’t afraid of passion or presence. You’ve got your own goals. You own your past. And you’re ready for something different.

You should also have the ability to travel. I've lived in 12 countries and been to 40ish, though I probably call Las Vegas home.

Pros about dating me:
- Financially secure 
- Tall
- High IQ and EQ
- Wordly 
- Love Music and Concerts 
- Avid Reader
- Coffee addict
- Explorer of all capacities. 😉
- I'll hold your hand, post you, and make sure you are seen
- I know how to protect my woman 
- Once a week I'll cook you amazing good

Cons about dating me:
- Allergic to animals, shellfish, Gluten and Dairy
- I work a lot but I never miss important things 
- I can be pretty stubborn 
- I tend to lean more into logic than feelings 
- I can be very annoying with my ""me-isms""
- I am a very intimate person. If you are not we won't make it.
- I grew up in a very traumatic home so sometimes I need more emotional patience than most  

Deal Breakers:
You have kids now. 
You want me to read the Bible or go to church (hard pass)
You use hard drugs or drink like you’re still in college
You ghost, breadcrumb, or avoid hard conversations

Bottom line:
I’m not here to fix you, save you, or chase you.
But if you’re the kind of woman who craves depth, fire, and a connection that’s actually worth showing up then let's chat.

Let’s see what’s possible.

I'm starting to enjoy the coffee cold.

The sun’s doing that lazy thing
where it stretches through the window
like it’s checking in on us. 

I feel the caress of the sun and I know this warmth is my earth's love language.

I don’t feel lost today.
I feel right here.
Exactly here.

The gift is this feeling. 

I feel like I won something.

anyways, i accidentally confided a little in my friend and she ended up recommending a therapist she talked to for free when she was suicidal. my concern is that the therapist wouldn’t want to take a client like me. i am not trying to compare mental illnesses here but i feel that what i want to say might be heavier than what the therapist is used to, since she’s doing this for free.

another concern is the fact that she’s a stranger and i don’t know anything about her. my friend said i could ask to meet in a coffee shop where there are many people around but i’m still a little worried, stranger danger you know ? i can also foresee the presence of tears and i am not too keen on crying in front of so many people. 

should i contact the therapist anyways ?

1k4fun4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1k4fun4/she_is_me/,SHE IS ME,"In a small city lived a girl, completely independent. She felt absolutely at peace in her own company. However, her loved ones had a different opinion.

Her family and friends insisted that solitude makes for a terrible life. True happiness can only be found in the company of other people.

Everyone worried about her, suggesting that she should socialize more or find a partner. They often told her, “You’ll never truly fulfill yourself if you’re always alone.” or “You need a lover to complete you.” She could not shake the feeling that they were right. How could they be wrong?

She always cherished the silence of her small home and the freedom it granted her. She enjoyed engaging in household routines, immersing herself in her thoughts. And she liked the fact that she were content on her own.

Everyday she lost herself in activities she enjoyed. And if something stopped bringing her pleasure, she would simply stop doing it and relish the fact that no one commented on her actions.

Her happiness lay in self-love everyday. She explored her inner sensations, feelings of independence, and self awareness that came along in moments of solitude. It was so great to indulge in something pleasant, and be free from the need to adapt to anyone’s preferences.

She visited significant places, took long walks from one city to another, and relaxed in the solitude of her home. Her evenings usually ended in her favorite cozy coffee shops, enjoying the sights and sounds.

The few friends she had would ask: “Don’t you ever feel lonely?” She would smile and say, “Ofc I have moments of melancholy. But being alone doesn’t mean being lonely. I have you and my family, but for everyday, I have myself.”

She relished her own company and didn’t believe that anyone else was responsible for her happiness. She did not impose demands on other people, and was devoid of deceptive expectations that someone else would solve her problems or entertain her.

There’s nothing wrong with watching a movie alone. There’s nothing wrong with ordering a large meal just for herself. There’s also nothing wrong if she doesn’t feel like leaving the house. There’s nothing wrong if she has her most enjoyable dates by herself.

Unwavering self-confidence, pursuing one’s interests, and a passion for life are reminders that solitude is not always synonymous with unhappiness.

Some find joy in socializing, while others, like her, find it in the opportunity to be alone with themselves.

She became a gentle reminder for those around her that all people are unique. He showed her friends and family that the path to happiness takes many forms, and each person finds happiness in different moments.

1k4fr8i,https://v.redd.it/gh3emeyvd7we1,What Are Some Good Monday Rituals to Start the Week Strong?,"8 Monday Rituals That Will Make You Unstoppable This Week

Meta Description: Ditch the Monday blues with 8 intentional rituals that reset your mindset, boost productivity, and give your week momentum. From micro-goals to power hours, start strong.

Let’s Be Honest: Mondays Have Trust Issues
Mondays often feel like a betrayal. You go from brunch and naps to inboxes and deadlines faster than your Wi-Fi drops on Zoom. But here’s the truth: Mondays don’t have to be the villain of your week.

In fact, they can be your secret weapon.

With a few high-impact Monday rituals, you can shift from “Ugh” to unstoppable. Whether you’re leading a team, freelancing from your kitchen table, or climbing the corporate ladder with caffeine and grit—these rituals will set the tone for a productive, intentional, and actually enjoyable week.

Let’s turn manic Monday into magnetic momentum.

1. The 15-Minute “Weekend Reset”
Why It Works: A cluttered start leads to a scattered week. Clarity on Monday = focus all week.

How to Do It:
✅ Clear your inbox: delete junk, flag follow-ups, and answer anything under 2 minutes.
✅ Clean your workspace: messy desk, messy brain—science says so.
✅ Scan your calendar: get ahead of surprises.

Pro Tip: Do this Sunday night or first thing Monday to avoid waking up in chaos. A little prep is a big vibe shift.

2. Set One Micro-Goal for Monday
Why It Works: Big to-do lists create stress. Micro-goals create movement.

How to Do It:
✅ Choose one high-impact task—just one.
✅ Break it into a 30–60 min block.
✅ Crush it early and ride that momentum like a productivity surfer.

Example: Instead of ""Finish project,"" try “Write intro + outline by noon.”

Takeaway: Progress, not perfection, wins the week.

3. Move Your Body Before You Move Your Mouse
Why It Works: Physical movement boosts dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins—aka, your productivity cocktail.

How to Do It:
✅ Stretch for 5 minutes.
✅ Take a brisk walk.
✅ Dance to Beyoncé. (No one's watching… probably.)

Bonus: Richard Branson credits morning workouts for his business stamina. If it’s good enough for a billionaire in a hot air balloon, it’s good enough for us.

4. Set an Intention (Not Just a Task List)
Why It Works: A to-do list is what you do. An intention defines how you show up.

How to Do It:
✅ Ask: “How do I want to feel by Friday?”
✅ Write a one-sentence mantra: “I lead with calm and clarity.”
✅ Check in at the end of the day—did you embody it?

Mindset Upgrade: Oprah does this. Enough said.

5. Use a “Power Hour” to Win Early
Why It Works: The first hour shapes your day. Protect it like your Netflix password.

How to Do It:
✅ No meetings.
✅ No email scrolling.
✅ Just one focused, satisfying task.

Example: Jeff Bezos prioritizes high-impact thinking time over back-to-back meetings. Your calendar deserves the same respect.

6. Feed Your Brain Something Inspiring
Why It Works: What you consume in the morning affects your energy, mindset, and even decision-making.

How to Do It:
✅ Listen to a 10-minute podcast.
✅ Read a motivating article.
✅ Play music that makes you feel like a movie protagonist.

Mood Shift: A good playlist is cheaper than therapy and more fun than Slack notifications.

7. Shrink Your Meetings (Or Skip Them)
Why It Works: Meetings are like mushrooms. Some are helpful; most are just fungus.

How to Do It:
✅ Block “No-Meeting Mondays” if you can.
✅ Replace hour-long meetings with 15-minute stand-ups.
✅ Schedule deep work in the morning.

Inspired By: Companies like Shopify and Asana implement “meeting-free” Mondays to protect focus and flow.

8. End With a 5-Minute Reflection
Why It Works: Reflecting on wins and snags makes tomorrow smarter—no productivity guilt required.

How to Do It:
✅ What went well today?
✅ What was frustrating?
✅ What’s the #1 priority for tomorrow?

Bill Gates-style move: Track and tweak your weekly patterns like an operating system update.

Final Thoughts: The Ritual Recipe for a Better Monday
Here’s your 8-ingredient success formula:
✔ Reset your space and schedule.
✔ Set one micro-goal.
✔ Move your body.
✔ Set an intention.
✔ Guard your power hour.
✔ Feed your mind something inspiring.
✔ Say no to unnecessary meetings.
✔ Reflect and reset.

1k4fpv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1k4fpv5/hope_fungal_overgrowth_eliminated_im_coming_back/,"HOPE (Fungal Overgrowth Eliminated, I’m Coming Back to Life!)","About a 18 months ago I quit Dupixent because I felt it wasn’t as effective as it had been and I realized that I wanted to figure out how to manage my eczema without depending on such a strong drug. 

After I quit, I went through hell. I was confused, scared, angry, in immense pain and discomfort at all times, and the inner turmoil was almost as bad as what was going on with my skin. My mom suggested a mold diet that I’d done years ago after being exposed to mold and suffering side effects on my skin, so as a last ditch effort, I decided to do it.  I didn’t follow the diet to a tee, and I ended it much earlier than I was supposed to, but here’s what I learned:

No carbs, no sugar (except for one teaspoon of raw, unprocessed honey), and high-sugar fruit were all cut from my diet. Within days my skin was improving. Within 3 months, I was in a completely different place than I’d been all year long. I broke the diet within a few months because it was having negative effects on me as well (weight loss, stress, malnutrition… all which occurred because I was being overly cautious about mold which ended up not being the issue. If I did the diet again it would be entirely different and much healthier.). When I stopped the diet, my progress continued!

Now, I maintain a diet of moderation which includes lots of veggies and protein and moderate carbs at each meal. I have my fully sweetened coffee every day, but avoid candy and eat dessert rarely. I drink soda eeeevery once in a while and I limit alcohol to one to two drinks a month. Basically, I know what hurts me and that really limits my desire for those things. I’ve never felt freer in my diet! Oh, and I do still snack on things like chips and cereals. 

Now, my main struggle is sweating in the heat and OCD picking. If I avoid too much sun and can control my OCD (which is easier when I’m less stressed, which I am now!) my skin heals sooo quickly. Hydrocolloid bandages on my ankles and feet (main problem area now) have been a huge help to stop picking and facilitate healing. I’d say I’m 85% healed and getting better every day.

All this to say, I believe that my main issue (and possibly the issue of many eczema sufferers) was a fungal overgrowth in my gut. Once I got that under control, everything changed. My sugar cravings are all but gone because the fungal overgrowth isn’t always begging my body for more sugar to keep it alive. I’m coming back to life you guys, and every area of my life proves it. My sleep is so much better, I’m nicer, I can go more places without feeling exhausted or uncomfortable… I’m experiencing a full life again. I’m getting emotional writing this because life was dark for so long!

I hope that this offers some hope to some people!! One last thing: the diet isn’t easy, it’s not an overnight fix, it will be mentally taxing, and you have to maintain a diet of moderation once you’re done. However, the results are WORTH IT. I encourage everybody to give it a try. I think you’ll be glad you did!

P.S. I have used Tacrolimus as well during this time. However, the amount I’ve used has dropped as I get better! I only put it on problem areas now.

P.P.S. I have other tips and tricks to manage the skin while in the healing process if anyone is interested. :)

TLDR; I believe my eczema was caused by a fungal overgrowth in my gut. Cutting out sugar, carbs, and high-sugar fruits for 3-4 months changed my LIFE. My sugar cravings are practically eliminated because the fungal overgrowth isn’t constantly begging for sugar to keep it alive. I stopped the diet but am still on my way to full healing because I maintain a diet of true moderation and I am SO MUCH HAPPIER!!! Please try, you won’t regret it. 🩷

Last winter, I found a barely used Kitchenaid Semi Automatic espresso machine at my local thrift store and she was a work horse for me. I liked exploring different roasts until I found one I really enjoyed last November and have been using the same roast ever since.

My espresso machine unfortunately stopped working in March. Since I used my espresso machine daily for nearly ~6 shots espresso daily, I decided to upgrade to a fully automatic to save time in the morning.

The thing is- the espresso is way too acidic. Like, to the point where it makes me gag. I’ve got a filter, always use purified water, and use the same beans but I’m so confused. Why does my coffee taste so bad?

Any help would be appreciated

I wanted to post here to see what advice, tips, recommendations, comments, thoughts and opinions you might want to share with someone moving to Columbus. I would love any insights into the rental market, walkability and public transit (I know it's mostly a bus system), food scene, arts and culture, etc. A few key things about me: I am vegan (is there a vegan food scene in Columbus?), I love walkability and cute areas to walk around, I love coffee shop culture, and I love art museums, theatre, music, and free/low-cost things to do. I also love fashion and thrifiting and luxury- does columbus have a luxury scene? I do sometimes buy pre-owned luxury bags from a consigment or vintage/thrift store.

A little background about me: I've lived in many different places, San Fran, Kansas City, L.A., Boston, Nashville and Switzerland. The areas I've loved the most are those with walkability, coffee shop culture, and arts. But I am also looking for affordability right now. Oh and I work from home and won't be looking for a job in the area (at least not in the near future.)

1k4fmzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1k4fmzb/im_still_a_virgin_at_21_i_just_got_friendzoned_by/,I’m still a virgin at 21. I just got friendzoned by the girl that I dated the first time after 5 dates. I feel so sad and lost.,"So I downloaded tinder about a month ago and I matched with this girl first week and was the first and only date I’ve managed to get out of the app. We went on 5 dates in the next 3 weeks, went for coffee, then a couple for drinks, then coffee at park and finally movie at my house. 

At the last movie date, I had my arm behind her and we were cuddling halfway through the movie, and she was leaning on me a bit and I got that she enjoyed it. Then she recommends we watch another one. I kept staring at her at times in hopes of her turning around to kiss but that never happened. Also, when I dropped her off, I told her I had a great time while looking at her but she didn’t give me time to go for a move and just left. Then when I asked her if she wanted to plan another date she told me that lately she’s been viewing me as a friend. And when I asked if it was because I didn’t make a move (I didn’t want to force it but maybe missed a signal or something) she told me it had nothing to do with that. Maybe it was because I was being very slow and almost didn’t flirt at all. 

I was confident that things were going well with her and I just kinda fell out of the clouds with that text. And tinder has been completely dead lately, I get no likes while I used to at least get a few matches a week. I feel so lost and I don’t know what to do. Should I even try to get out the friendzone? She agreed to a platonic coffee next week that I recommended, and I just want to ask her what I did wrong. 

I feel like I’m back on square 1 but now I have even less options than before because I get no likes now. I even downloaded a few more apps and got very few matches, and the only means of meeting girls I have right now is through the apps since nothing comes out of my social group. And no I don’t want to start a hobby just to meet women, that seems forced to me.

Next month I turn 21 and I feel so left behind an inexperienced.

Got off SL Western Caribbean Cruise to Roatan, Costa Maya, & Bimini(6 day cruise) we were in a XL Sea Terrace Rm:12334A (close to front of ship)
We chose Virgin because my hubby is a teacher and wanted a no cruise experience (he Loves kids but needed a break🤣) I’m a nurse and I think you already know healthcare is stressful (I didn’t care what type of cruise I just needed a reset)
This was also our 10th Anniversary cruise and a much needed one because hubby lost both parents last year -We have had a year to say the least….
Okay enough about us….

I booked directly online in Dec2024 paid in full but couldn’t get the extra 10% off I think because I wasn’t so my days out for booking… I got a $200 bar tab but no sailor loot (still not sure how or when that is given out) we don’t drink but were told we could use the bar tab on specialty juices/smoothies/coffees/ non alcoholic beverages.

We flew in same day first flight out to Miami arrived at 930am -I was in disbelief how OLD and Dirty the Miami airport looked  yes they are renovating but it looks like it’s never been renovated since it’s inception…. We ate at Burger King then got an Uber to port because we received a message from VV that there was a game near the port and traffic could be bad so we figured we better just get there since we were unfamiliar with the area.

We arrived about 1145a got our bands then went back outside to sit for our check in time which was 330pm- it’s was very hot outside, they did have a trolley that takes you to the market place but we declined -we were able to get a seat outside on a concrete block so we didn’t want to move. We boarded a little early like 310p

There are porters who check your bag for room delivery -I didn’t check mine as I had a carry on and personal item and figured since when you board you can go straight to your room I could unpack while watching the safety video.

While waiting I was able to meet and have good convo with them and staff who were very pleasant and helpful.

While getting our bands there was a “last chance” to get a bar tab at a discount I think $25 off hubby bought one to my dismay because now we have a $400 bar tab(I didn’t think we would drink that many non alcoholic beverages/fresh juice/specialty coffees) -we got close I think we left $75 on the tab that you lose. We mostly got fresh juices and because they were 6 oz we just got a taller glass and they charged us twice.

*our outlet plug was confiscated it had usb/usc/and plug in outlets on it (Amazon sold it as cruise approved) it was not and I saw about 20-30 more of those and steamers-we were able to pick our plug up at end of cruise (and back to Amazon it will go) I’m glad I bought my all into one charger for my watch/phone/airpods. I also bought my iPad wire/plug so there were enough outlets for me. **There are NO US-C outlets only USB so bring the actual plug not just the wire with you)

** Dress Code** Come as You are be as Comfortable or as Extra as you like**
I saw everything from tanks/board shirts/flip flops to costumes/ to sparkly gowns.
I traveled w/a carryon and personal items all shows were my Archie’s flip flops in multiple colors one pair of tennis shoes I wore on plane for workouts/walks. Couple of bathing suits/coverups, 2 workout pants one pair shorts with 4 workout shirts, and a few easy breezy sundresses that didn’t require ironing maybe a few sprays of downy wrinkle release, and very minimal makeup and I still looked put together and fabulous! 

1. The Room(XL sea terrace12334A): looked just like the many YT videos I watched before hand. We chose this room because me my hubby likes space and he wanted a separate toilet if it were me I would have gotten the reg sea terrace room or even a sea view and maybe an inside cabin to save money. I mean you’re mostly in your room to sleep anyways.
Room very clean (I still wiped and lysoled freq touched areas and our bed sheets-lol) we had 2 red beach towels that you had to return to the room or be charged $25.
We had a bottle of Moet with a card -I asked the room attendant who was wonderful if we could exchange for a non alcoholic wine but she wasn’t sure. They actually sent us a second bottle days later- I gifted them to others(my room attendant and our cab driver ) since we couldn’t take them with us (we didn’t check any luggage otherwise we would have and gifted to friends instead )
The water pressure was strong- I hate rain showers so glad they had a wand) because we had a XL room our toilet was separate -the flush is strong and LOUD!!
Oh and the Hammock….. It’s EVERYTHANG‼️be ready to fall asleep so day your alarm🤣 or you will sleep right through your day.

2. Sadly…. We missed the sail away, the pajama party, AND our dinner reservation which was at 615p 😩☹️. After the safety video and safety checkin we ate at The Galley still had 2 1/2 hours before the sail away went to take a nap and slept through the night -We were Soo tired! I think early morning travel and being out in the sun for 3 hours waiting to board zapped our energy. I was soo bummed that we missed everything that first night BUT it was some of the BEST sleep I had in a long time- the movement of the boat felt like a comforting rock to sleep.
* I think the Pajama party should be on the second night*

3. The food: 
* The Galley (food court style)I enjoyed the variety.  I also loved that it wasn’t a buffet where you served yourself (I think it helps with infection control and people at self serve buffets can be gross at times)
Yes some things were premade in The Galley I figured it had to be with so many people on the boat. You could also do made to order for items so no biggie.
The atmosphere and layout was nice many places to sit that had a view of the o ran while you ate. Many attendants coming by to take dirty dishes cleaning was being done continuously. Only Downside was it was sometimes hard to locate the person going around with the fresh squeezed juice cart. I think having them stationary would better-maybe near the popsicle cart area. We ate at the galley for breakfast daily except when we went to the wake for brunch, we had lunch,dinner when we missed or canceled dinner reservations, and we got grab and go sushi bento boxes, salads, and desserts (loved the pineapple mango tres leches and the dark chocolate mousse in the grab and go section) 
* Extra Virgin- our food was delish! It was hott the atmosphere was. Beautiful as well -we even got in a second time as a walk in for dinner (cancelled razzle dazzle /lucky lotus) the soup &Mediterranean Sea bass was my fav! Hubby had calamari and a squid ink spot pasta he loved. They knew it was our anniversary and had a cute red dessert looked like red bubbles it was a chocolate mousse with a little white chocolate mermaid and sea shell on top of one sort of graham cracker it was good and a nice touch we also love Mr the little donut holes w/raspberry sauce and crème and the vanilla affogato.
* The Wake- Beautiful  setting-be sure to take a pic by the white piano as a keep sake. The food for Brunch and Dinner was Top Notch for us. Brunch fav-French toast -it taste better than he one in The Galley. Dinner I Loved the clam chowder (it came dry and they added the sauce)
* Pink Agave-food was average. We had chicken enchiladas/corn, fish, and shrimp dishes. Wasn’t impressed with the dessert. We don’t eat beef/pork so that could be why I gave it an average rating as there were many other options than what we had.
** I do think they should open for lunch with maybe some other food options**

*The Dock (not a restaurant- but a FAV of ours)- OPA hour is a MUST!! Lamb, chicken thigh, shrimp, and Octopus skewers were chefs kiss!! We had those a few times lol
Other food areas we loved- I can’t remember the name but it was where they served carnival food (wings/popcorn/hot dogs/pretzels etc)
Ice Cream and Of Course Pizza Place ALL 10/10!!

4. Other areas we Loved- The GYM- very clean, not smelly, lots of options loved the cardio/weight split areas and of course the Views facing the ocean made your workout worth it!
I also LOVED the Walking track at the top deck of the ship! The views were Very Nice!!
Loved the Basketball court HOWEVER it could use some TLC- the balls were old cracked and the basket ball rims basket chains were rusted and broken. Hopefully that will be taken care of as the SL is going for a refresh soon I believe.

5. Pool: Small I think there is room for a second small pool if the remove some of those over priced cabanas or maybe near the catamaran area there is a large seating area there that wasn’t used much.
*Hot Tubs: there are plenty HOWEVER I think a nice Virgin sign saying be courteous of time used as most of the free ones the same group would be in them almost the whole day. Like early morning, someone would go get food, they would stay in there through lunch and let eve. I saw this with multiple people. I was able to get in one early early am finally.

6: Shows/activities/live music:
We didn’t go to any shows-the times either clashed with our dinner times, they were full, or we were back in room for later show chilling and watching a movie.
Live music- we did attend those as they were scattered all around the ship which I liked and thought was a great idea. Our fav was the soul reggae group but all live music we heard was good. 
**We missed Scarlet Night- we had dinner in our red did some photos around the ship it was beautiful but we couldn’t stay awake hahahaha

7: Ports- We Loved The All!! love the hop on hop off of it all. The Costa Maya stop there were 2 Carnival and 1 RCI at that port  so it was busy and had a lot of kids but I loved seeing the families vacation together I got to meet and talk to lots of people from those ships that said they would love to try a kid free ship themselves lol. I especially LOVED the Bimini Beach Club! Atmosphere was FUN FUN FUN!! Weather, and water were Beautiful and food was good I tried a bit of everything!

8: Casino: Hubby loved it. Not too big not too small.variety of slot machines, some tables-black jack, roulette, craps etc. 

9. Shopping on Board: lots to choose from. Lots of designer but there is also a shop with a lot of $10 close to the dock area- totebags, coverups, crossbody bags, costume jewelry, hats, etc.

All in All We LOVED ❤️❤️our first cruise🚢 experience even though we missed some of the staple activities of VV ships.
I think we Really just needed to RELAX and REST and that we did! No big schedules just wake up and do whatever you want. 

There was a special going on to put a $150 down payment on your next cruise you have to book within 2 yrs-some have said it’s not a good deal because it has to be on a sea terrace or above but we bought 2 anyways as you can transfer it to others either way they will get used.

My Biggest Tip: 
Whatever you do ENJOY this Life!! 
This last year was an emotionally trying one for us as a couple our vows truly came into play. Sickness/health/grief/ just over worked and over stimulated in general, sometimes we were two ships passing….
This trip taught me That we deserve to take a break, We deserve to use ALL of our PTO, to listen to our bodies, to pour into each other more, pour into our marriage more, and pour into ourselves as individuals more. We deserve Rest, We deserve relaxation. We deserve more VV cruises 🤣❤️🤣",21,1745247367.0,VirginVoyages,5,1.0,False

So let me present to you my pet peeves:
Unnecessarrily long prompts - about nearly anything. And the ""press = to continue"" ARGH! Can't you just display whatever you have to say/celebrate/infom about in a discreet little box to the side of the screen. Maybe blinking if it's THAT important. That way I can just enter my ship or interact with a given console, WHILE at the same time rejoycing about the umptieth mile I have walked in the game or whatever, thankyouverymuch.

The beginning of each run... Well, lemme just brew a pot of coffee while your, uhm, multitool thingy comes online (cough cough) .

Game loves to take its sweet time to get on with the mission after you finished a stage. Just show me what I gotta do next. 

Dear game. I understand you want me land ""there"", but I'mma land HERE. Just because.
 
Why press buttons for a long time. Why not just ""click"" the button?

1k4fhhi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4fhhi,First overnighter with Kantamus,"I went and got myself a Kantamus after getting a couple of great selling deals on lightweight packs I didn't use.

Took it out for a test drive overnighter. I deliberately loaded up with a full ""luxury"" kit (axe, saw, knife, bigger IFAK, heavier jacket, ""heavier"" food, beer etc..) to try out the carrying capability. With water, food and other beverages, the total weight was 18 kg.

I did about 8 km on the first day, which was 50/50 trail and bush. Took me about 3 hours with a coffee break. On day two I did a slightly shorter hike (5-6 km). 

I have absolutely no complaints about the packs' ability to carry. Both the shoulder straps and hip belt felt really good. Compared to my Bergans Helium 55 (with a great lightweight frame), I didn't really ""suffer"" more or less. But what surprised me the most was the sweating, or lack of it. I was prepared to soak my back (I usually sweat alot when moving with weight). Temperature was around 10 C, but I didn't notice any difference from other packs with similar conditions.

The pack excelled when I had to move off trail. Even with 18 kg I felt I could move with ease through bush, on elevation, and swampy areas where your balance is tested. Everything is just tight and steady on you with this!

The compartments are just what I look for in a backpack. Nothing fancy, just a big main compartment with good measurements for sleeping bags, shelter, air pads, clothes etc. The small side pockets are just made for an axe or kanteen shaped bottle (combined with the side pack strap to cinch it down). 

I'm not a big fan of bigger lids. This time I put my down jacket and poncho in it, and had no problem getting it in or out. However, when you take the backpack off, the lid just bothers me as you have this heavy off balance extra pouch hanging there. But this might just be me. 

I had the Askare attached on the outside with the side pack straps. This combo is truly awesome. It sits there like it's glued on if you connect the split bar buckles on the Askare. I love having a ""throw around"" bag at camp with cooking supplies and useful stuff, and the Askare is made for it. 

So to sum it up:

Pros:
+Great carrying capability (and comfort, tbh) 
+Sits really well when moving in more challenging environments
+Well planned
+Can probably handle a bear attack (although I only came across some bores) 

Cons:
-Not a big fan of the floating lid (but might get used to it)
-Side pockets could be slightly roomier

Undecided:
*Haven't thought of a good use for the flat front pocket without interfering with my main compartment load

Keep in mind that this was a two day, one night trial. I'll have to give it plenty more miles before getting back with a trustworthy review. ",21,1745247203.0,Savotta,4,1.0,False

I am 24F and after having COVID in September of 2021 I started throwing up 3-5 times daily with really liquid stool. I would get seen by many doctors and they thought I was pregnant. I am married, but at the time my husband was deployment overseas. All pregnancy tests were negative. All doctors at the time brushed it off as the Flu. In 2023, it got severely worse. I was still throwing up 3-5 times daily with liquid stool. The abdominal pain was getting to a 5/10 where was only at 3/10 before. Then I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy in 2024 and they found benign polyps and ulcers that they removed and zapped. My gastroenterologist diagnosed me with post infectious IBS caused by Covid. This year, it got even more severe. I have started vomiting 4-7 times now, I will sometimes have blood and vomit in my stool and have issues where I’m feeling like I’m going to pass out. I have also been having severe abdominal pain starting from my bellybutton to my pelvic region. Sometimes when urinating, I will have a really bad pulling pain. I have had 2 CT with contrast and they think I have a peptic ulcer with contrast that is less likely to be a mass. I have had numerous labs and my liver enzymes are little high, glucose is a little high, high bili count, potassium is low, bacteria in my UA, and my blood count is also a little high. I have an IUD that gets taken out in November this year. I was seen at the ER on Saturday and the Doctor highly suggested I get seen by an OBGYN or Gynecologist as they think it could be endometriosis now.

At the last movie date, I had my arm behind her and we were cuddling halfway through the movie, and she was leaning on me a bit and I got that she enjoyed it. Then she recommends we watch another one. I kept staring at her at times in hopes of her turning around to kiss but that never happened.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best leather coffee tables combine premium materials, meticulous craftsmanship, and thoughtful design. Here's a closer look at the key features that distinguish top-rated models in 2025.

**Material Quality: Genuine vs. Faux Leather**

The type of leather used is a crucial factor. Genuine leather, particularly top-grain or full-grain, offers superior durability, a richer texture, and a natural patina that develops over time. Faux leather (PU leather) is a more affordable alternative that mimics the look and feel of genuine leather, often with good resistance to spills and scratches. The choice depends on your budget and priorities regarding longevity and authenticity.

**Frame Construction: Solid Wood vs. Metal**

The underlying frame determines the coffee table's stability and weight capacity. Solid hardwood frames, such as oak or maple, are known for their strength and resistance to warping. Metal frames, typically steel or iron, offer a sleek, modern aesthetic and can support heavier loads. The best option depends on the desired style and the expected use of the coffee table.

**Stitching and Detailing: Hand-Sewn vs. Machine-Made**

The quality of the stitching and other details reflects the overall craftsmanship. Hand-sewn stitching often indicates higher quality and greater attention to detail, resulting in a more refined and durable finish. Machine-made stitching can be more consistent and efficient, but may lack the unique character of hand-sewn work. Pay attention to the stitch density, thread type, and overall neatness.

**Storage Options: Drawers, Shelves, or Lift-Top Mechanisms**

Many leather coffee tables incorporate storage solutions to maximize functionality. Drawers provide concealed storage for remote controls, magazines, and other items. Shelves offer open display space for books, decorative objects, or baskets. Lift-top mechanisms allow the tabletop to be raised, creating a convenient surface for working, eating, or playing games. Consider your storage needs and how the coffee table will be used in your living space.

**Size and Dimensions: Height, Width, and Length**

The size of the coffee table should be proportional to the size of your sofa and the overall dimensions of your living room. A general guideline is to choose a coffee table that is approximately two-thirds the length of your sofa and about the same height as the sofa cushions. Consider the available space and how the coffee table will fit into the room's layout.

**Finishes and Color Options:**

Leather coffee tables are available in a range of finishes and colors, from classic brown and black to more contemporary shades like gray, white, and even navy. The finish can range from matte to glossy, affecting the overall look and feel. Choose a color and finish that complements your existing d闁肩厧宕抩r and personal style.

 ## Core Benefits

A well-chosen leather coffee table provides more than just a surface; it enhances your living space in multiple ways.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** A leather coffee table instantly elevates the style of your living room, adding a touch of luxury and sophistication. The rich texture and warm tones of leather create a visually appealing focal point that complements a variety of d闁肩厧宕抩r styles, from traditional to modern. A high-quality leather coffee table makes a bold statement.

**Improved Functionality:** Beyond aesthetics, a leather coffee table provides a practical surface for everyday activities. It offers a convenient place to rest drinks, snacks, books, or electronic devices. Models with storage options, such as drawers or shelves, further enhance functionality by providing space to organize and declutter your living room.

**Increased Durability and Longevity:** Genuine leather is a highly durable material that can withstand daily wear and tear. A well-maintained leather coffee table can last for many years, even decades, becoming a cherished heirloom. The natural patina that develops over time adds character and value to the piece. Investing in a high-quality leather coffee table is a long-term investment.

**Easy Maintenance and Cleaning:** Leather is surprisingly easy to clean and maintain. Regular dusting and occasional conditioning with a leather cleaner and conditioner will keep it looking its best. Spills can usually be wiped away with a damp cloth, preventing stains. With proper care, a leather coffee table can retain its beauty and functionality for years to come.

**Added Comfort and Warmth:** Leather has a natural warmth and softness that makes it inviting and comfortable. Unlike cold, hard surfaces, a leather coffee table adds a touch of coziness to your living room, creating a more welcoming and relaxing atmosphere. The tactile quality of leather makes it a pleasure to touch and use.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about leather coffee tables.

**How do I care for a leather coffee table?**

Regular dusting with a soft cloth is essential to remove dirt and debris. Condition the leather every 6-12 months with a high-quality leather conditioner to prevent drying and cracking. For spills, blot immediately with a clean, damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the leather.

**What is the difference between genuine leather and faux leather (PU leather)?**

Genuine leather is made from animal hides and offers superior durability, texture, and longevity. Faux leather, also known as PU leather, is a synthetic material that mimics the look and feel of genuine leather but is typically less expensive. Genuine leather develops a natural patina over time, while faux leather does not.

**Can a leather coffee table be used in a home with pets and children?**

Yes, but with caution. Leather is relatively durable, but sharp claws or rough play can cause scratches or tears. Consider using a leather protector to minimize damage. Choose a darker color to conceal scratches and stains. Also, ensure the coffee table has rounded edges to prevent injuries.

**What is the best way to choose the right size leather coffee table for my living room?**

Measure the length of your sofa and aim for a coffee table that is approximately two-thirds its length. The coffee table should also be about the same height as the sofa cushions. Leave at least 18 inches of space between the coffee table and the sofa to allow for comfortable movement.

When I tell him that will conflict with that and he then mentioned let's get there  in the morning. 

Okay dude, it's not that easy. I have to get their stuff ready, text the boarder etc. Not to mention he was able to get an hour workout in and i still need to fit mine ( 100% needed for my mental health) pack for myself and my kids ( because you know he only has to pack for him) finish all our laundry, set the cat up to me alone..I am sure i am missing something.

Being an introvert has always made it a bit challenging to put myself out there, especially when it comes to finding a partner. I’m not the loudest person in the room, and social situations can sometimes feel overwhelming. But I’ve learned to embrace who I am—someone who values meaningful connections over surface-level interactions. While it hasn’t been easy navigating the dating world, I’m here trying my luck, hoping to find someone who understands the beauty of quiet moments and appreciates shared passions like gaming and deep conversations. If you’re someone who’s also searching for that special connection, maybe we can be each other’s ""Player 2"" in this journey.

By Night: The Watchkeeper
I work as a security officer, primarily on night shifts. My job requires constant vigilance and attention to detail, conducting regular patrols to ensure that the premises are secure and everything is in order. Monitoring surveillance cameras is another key aspect of my role, where I keep a sharp eye out for any unusual activity or potential concerns. It’s a position that demands focus, quick decision-making, and the ability to remain calm under pressure—skills that I’ve come to value both at work and in life. During quieter moments on the shift, I often find ways to stay engaged by watching movies or playing games on my Steam Deck, making use of downtime without losing sight of my responsibilities.

The Gaming Realm Enthusiast
Gaming is my passion, especially when it comes to RPGs, co-op adventures, and PvE-focused games. Titles like Minecraft, Elder Scrolls, Monster Hunter Wilds, and Valheim allow me to immerse myself in vast worlds filled with quests, exploration, and teamwork. I love strategizing with friends in co-op missions or tackling challenges together against the game's environmental elements—like navigating treacherous landscapes or surviving harsh weather conditions. PvE games captivate me because they emphasize collaboration and creativity rather than direct competition. On the flip side, FPS games rarely hold my interest unless they involve cooperative modes or horde-based gameplay—pure PvP shooters just don’t grab my attention. For me, gaming is about building stories, solving challenges as a team, and enjoying immersive experiences that bring people together.

Creative Pursuits
I’ve always had a casual interest in art and music creation. Self-taught in sketching and basic design concepts, I enjoy experimenting with new ideas and techniques whenever inspiration strikes. Music is another creative outlet I’m exploring—I have novice knowledge of piano that I use to craft simple melodies and dream of expanding my skills further. Recently, I’ve been drawn to learning acoustic guitar as a way to complement my piano abilities and deepen my understanding of music composition. There’s something exciting about creating harmonies from scratch and seeing how different instruments can work together to bring ideas to life. While I’m still learning, the process itself is rewarding—it’s less about perfection and more about expressing myself through sound and art.

Melodic Moments
Music is a diverse and integral part of my life. I enjoy listening to a wide range of genres, from the heavy riffs of Stoner, Doom, Desert, and Grudge metal to the eclectic sounds of Indie rock and pop. Electronic music also has a special place in my heart, particularly Progressive House for its emotional depth and layered soundscapes, Synthwave for its nostalgic blend of retro and futuristic elements, and Phonk for its high-energy beats that get me pumped up for my workouts. I’m very lyrical and insightful when it comes to music; I need the lyrics to be meaningful and impactful rather than mindless or repetitive. For me, music is about connection and storytelling—not just background noise.

Dreaming of Simplicity
I believe life doesn’t have to be complicated to be fulfilling. My dream is rooted in embracing simple mediocrity—the kind that allows you to appreciate life’s small joys without chasing after unnecessary chaos or grandeur. Whether it’s sipping coffee on the porch during crisp mornings or tending to a small garden as the sun sets, these moments are where happiness truly resides for me. It’s about finding contentment in everyday routines—cooking dinner while listening to music that resonates deeply or unwinding with a book or game after a long day. I value peace over perfection—a life where things don’t have to be extravagant but are meaningful enough to make you feel grounded. At the end of the day, simplicity isn’t boring; it’s freeing.

The Final Piece
If you’ve made it this far—thank you! This post has been through countless edits because I wanted it to reflect who I truly am while being inviting enough for someone like you to connect with me. What I’m looking for is someone who shares many of these interests—gaming adventures, creative pursuits, diverse music tastes—and values open communication above all else. A partner who isn’t afraid to share their opinions or even disagree with mine without taking offense because meaningful discussions (and even disputes) are what help us grow together.

I’m not looking for something short-term; I want something lasting—a long-term connection or even a forever term if we’re lucky enough to find that spark together. If you’re someone who values honesty, mutual respect, shared passions, and building something meaningful over time, then let’s start this journey together.

Month 3: Met C and we’re both attracted to each other and things escalated very quickly.  He called me his gf and I enjoyed the attention he gave me. Kinda in a rs with C so I stopped meeting A. We only see each other exclusively.

Month 4: But things always don’t feel right at the back of my mind with C so I ended things with him. Like I can almost be certain he’s lovebombing me with his words and giving me empty promises to keep me for sex. Continued meeting new ppl.

Month 5: Somehow again meeting A because I really enjoyed my time with him, but in a friendly way. Then He suggested doing something that would unofficially suggest we’re a couple and I rejected out of fear/embarrassment/shyness/overthinking (now I kinda regret it). Still meeting new ppl

Month 6: Met A for 2 more times and things fizzled out as both of us stopped communicating with each other. Still meeting new ppl

Month 7: Continued meeting ppl and didn’t lead to anything. I guess I started feeling disappointed with myself and my matches that I need a break 

So here I am, single. I’m curious how’s your dating journey going?",3,1745246627.0,sgdatingscene,7,0.67,False

But instead of multiple choice and boring-ass mock quizzes, you get:

* **A cursed driving academy**
* **An AI that stalks you for every road rule mistake**
* **A hacker teddy bear**
* **And no easy way out**

Yeah. It’s chaos. But the twist? You actually *learn* stuff while trying to survive. Speed limits, road signs, stopping distances—they all matter if you want to make it out alive.

Being an introvert has always made it a bit challenging to put myself out there, especially when it comes to finding a partner. I’m not the loudest person in the room, and social situations can sometimes feel overwhelming. But I’ve learned to embrace who I am—someone who values meaningful connections over surface-level interactions. While it hasn’t been easy navigating the dating world, I’m here trying my luck, hoping to find someone who understands the beauty of quiet moments and appreciates shared passions like gaming and deep conversations. If you’re someone who’s also searching for that special connection, maybe we can be each other’s ""Player 2"" in this journey.

By Night: The Watchkeeper
I work as a security officer, primarily on night shifts. My job requires constant vigilance and attention to detail, conducting regular patrols to ensure that the premises are secure and everything is in order. Monitoring surveillance cameras is another key aspect of my role, where I keep a sharp eye out for any unusual activity or potential concerns. It’s a position that demands focus, quick decision-making, and the ability to remain calm under pressure—skills that I’ve come to value both at work and in life. During quieter moments on the shift, I often find ways to stay engaged by watching movies or playing games on my Steam Deck, making use of downtime without losing sight of my responsibilities.

The Gaming Realm Enthusiast
Gaming is my passion, especially when it comes to RPGs, co-op adventures, and PvE-focused games. Titles like Minecraft, Elder Scrolls, Monster Hunter Wilds, and Valheim allow me to immerse myself in vast worlds filled with quests, exploration, and teamwork. I love strategizing with friends in co-op missions or tackling challenges together against the game's environmental elements—like navigating treacherous landscapes or surviving harsh weather conditions. PvE games captivate me because they emphasize collaboration and creativity rather than direct competition. On the flip side, FPS games rarely hold my interest unless they involve cooperative modes or horde-based gameplay—pure PvP shooters just don’t grab my attention. For me, gaming is about building stories, solving challenges as a team, and enjoying immersive experiences that bring people together.

Creative Pursuits
I’ve always had a casual interest in art and music creation. Self-taught in sketching and basic design concepts, I enjoy experimenting with new ideas and techniques whenever inspiration strikes. Music is another creative outlet I’m exploring—I have novice knowledge of piano that I use to craft simple melodies and dream of expanding my skills further. Recently, I’ve been drawn to learning acoustic guitar as a way to complement my piano abilities and deepen my understanding of music composition. There’s something exciting about creating harmonies from scratch and seeing how different instruments can work together to bring ideas to life. While I’m still learning, the process itself is rewarding—it’s less about perfection and more about expressing myself through sound and art.

Melodic Moments
Music is a diverse and integral part of my life. I enjoy listening to a wide range of genres, from the heavy riffs of Stoner, Doom, Desert, and Grudge metal to the eclectic sounds of Indie rock and pop. Electronic music also has a special place in my heart, particularly Progressive House for its emotional depth and layered soundscapes, Synthwave for its nostalgic blend of retro and futuristic elements, and Phonk for its high-energy beats that get me pumped up for my workouts. I’m very lyrical and insightful when it comes to music; I need the lyrics to be meaningful and impactful rather than mindless or repetitive. For me, music is about connection and storytelling—not just background noise.

Dreaming of Simplicity
I believe life doesn’t have to be complicated to be fulfilling. My dream is rooted in embracing simple mediocrity—the kind that allows you to appreciate life’s small joys without chasing after unnecessary chaos or grandeur. Whether it’s sipping coffee on the porch during crisp mornings or tending to a small garden as the sun sets, these moments are where happiness truly resides for me. It’s about finding contentment in everyday routines—cooking dinner while listening to music that resonates deeply or unwinding with a book or game after a long day. I value peace over perfection—a life where things don’t have to be extravagant but are meaningful enough to make you feel grounded. At the end of the day, simplicity isn’t boring; it’s freeing.

The Final Piece
If you’ve made it this far—thank you! This post has been through countless edits because I wanted it to reflect who I truly am while being inviting enough for someone like you to connect with me. What I’m looking for is someone who shares many of these interests—gaming adventures, creative pursuits, diverse music tastes—and values open communication above all else. A partner who isn’t afraid to share their opinions or even disagree with mine without taking offense because meaningful discussions (and even disputes) are what help us grow together.

I’m not looking for something short-term; I want something lasting—a long-term connection or even a forever term if we’re lucky enough to find that spark together. If you’re someone who values honesty, mutual respect, shared passions, and building something meaningful over time, then let’s start this journey together.

I am 24F and after having COVID in September of 2021 I started throwing up 3-5 times daily with really liquid stool. I would get seen by many doctors and they thought I was pregnant. I am married, but at the time my husband was deployment overseas. All pregnancy tests were negative. All doctors at the time brushed it off as the Flu. In 2023, it got severely worse. I was still throwing up 3-5 times daily with liquid stool. The abdominal pain was getting to a 5/10 where was only at 3/10 before. Then I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy in 2024 and they found benign polyps and ulcers that they removed and zapped. My gastroenterologist diagnosed me with post infectious IBS caused by Covid. This year, it got even more severe. I have started vomiting 4-7 times now, I will sometimes have blood and vomit in my stool and have issues where I’m feeling like I’m going to pass out. I have also been having severe abdominal pain starting from my bellybutton to my pelvic region. Sometimes when urinating, I will have a really bad pulling pain. I have an IUD that gets taken out in November this year. I was seen at the ER on Saturday and the Doctor highly suggested I get seen by an OBGYN or Gynecologist as they think it could be endometriosis now. I have an appointment tomorrow, but I am just wondering if anyone has gone through a similar experience or could give any advice. They have me on medications currently for treating ulcers, but they never work.

Short Devotional about Just feel good

Introduction
------------

In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, it’s easy to focus on our never-ending to-do lists and forget to take care of our mental and emotional well-being. Often, happiness is mistaken for something that comes from external sources, yet the truth is that feeling good is a state of mind that can be cultivated from within. Imagine a life where joy is not reliant on circumstances but rooted in a deeper, more consistent source.

Today, we delve into the profound simplicity of just feeling good—not as a fleeting emotion, but as a deliberate choice. We explore how a simple shift in perspective can transform ordinary moments into extraordinary blessings. Let’s embrace this day with an open heart and the anticipation that feeling good is not only possible but entirely within our reach.

Bible Verse
-----------

“Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!” — Philippians 4:4 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

This powerful verse from Philippians serves as a timeless reminder that joy is not reliant on our circumstances but rather on our relationship with God. The Apostle Paul, who wrote these words while facing his own hardships, knew firsthand the power of rejoicing through challenges. Rejoicing in the Lord transcends temporary trials and shifts our focus from what’s happening around us to the eternal goodness of God’s love.

The directive to “Rejoice in the Lord always” highlights the limitless nature of joy when it is centered on God. It’s not just about being happy when everything is going right, but about maintaining an attitude of joy and gratitude even amidst difficulties. This perspective encourages us to look past momentary distress and see the bigger picture of God’s unwavering presence in our lives.

Joy found in God is impermeable by the world’s ups and downs. When we ground our happiness in Him, we tap into an inexhaustible source of strength and contentment. It’s about choosing to engage with positivity and gratitude, regardless of what life throws our way.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Start your day by listing three things you are grateful for, focusing on the blessings God has provided.

– Practice mindfulness by taking a moment each day to pause, breathe, and connect with God in prayer or meditation.

– Surround yourself with positive influences, such as uplifting music, nurturing relationships, and inspiring literature or podcasts.

– Invest time in activities that bring you joy and help you feel God’s presence—whether it’s a walk in nature, creating art, or serving others.

– Reflect on your day with a sense of gratitude, reminding yourself of God’s faithfulness.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– What are some things or people in your life that bring you genuine joy?

– How can you cultivate a sense of joy in your current circumstances?

– Describe a time when you felt God’s presence filling you with happiness.

– What are practical steps you can take to prioritize joy in your daily routine?

Prayer
------

Dear God,

Thank you for the countless blessings in my life and the joy that you bring to my heart. Help me to find my joy in You always, regardless of the situations I face. Teach me to rejoice in Your goodness and share this joy with those around me. May my life be a reflection of Your love and happiness. In Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.

Social Posts
------------

– “Today, I’m choosing joy! Let’s rejoice in the Lord always, for His love is constant and unchanging. #ChooseJoy #RejoiceAlways”

– “Finding joy in God is the best way to feel good every day. Grateful for His unending love! #FeelingGood #GodsJoy”

– “Rejoicing in the Lord changes everything—even when life’s tough, His love keeps me smiling! #JoyOfTheLord #Faithful”

Conclusion
----------

Choosing to feel good is not just about reacting to life’s highs and lows—it’s about anchoring our joy in the Lord. Philippians 4:4 reminds us that real joy is found in a relationship with our Creator, and it empowers us to navigate life’s challenges with grace and positivity. By welcoming God’s joy into our hearts, we enrich our lives with peace and fulfillment.

Q&amp;A about Just feel good
----------------------------

Certainly! Here’s a Q&amp;A set based on the theme of “Just Feel Good”:

- - - - - -

**Q1: What are some simple activities that can instantly boost your mood?**

A1: Engaging in activities like taking a short walk in nature, listening to your favorite music, practicing deep breathing or meditation, doodling, or spending a few minutes playing with a pet can all help boost your mood quickly.

- - - - - -

**Q2: How can gratitude practices enhance your everyday well-being?**

A2: Practicing gratitude can shift your focus from what’s lacking in your life to appreciating what you have. By regularly acknowledging these positive aspects, you can cultivate a more positive outlook, which has been shown to reduce stress and improve overall well-being.

- - - - - -

**Q3: What role does physical exercise play in feeling good daily?**

A3: Physical exercise releases endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that act as natural mood lifters. Regular exercise can help reduce stress, alleviate anxiety, improve sleep, and boost self-esteem, all of which contribute to a general sense of well-being.

- - - - - -

**Q5: What are some quick mindfulness techniques to try during a busy day?**

- - - - - -

**Q6: How does social connection contribute to a feeling of well-being?**

A6: Social connection is crucial for emotional support, sharing experiences, and building a sense of belonging. Interacting with friends or loved ones, whether in person or virtually, can enhance happiness and reduce feelings of loneliness.

- - - - - -

**Q7: What’s a small act of kindness one can do to feel good and spread positivity?**

A7: Small acts like complimenting a colleague, volunteering some time, paying for someone’s coffee, or sending a thoughtful note can brighten someone else’s day and also make you feel good, as contributing to others’ happiness is often rewarding.

I have also been having severe abdominal pain starting from my bellybutton to my pelvic region. Sometimes when urinating, I will have a really bad pulling pain.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The defining characteristics of amber white perfumes lie in their carefully crafted composition and the interplay of various notes. These perfumes are not simply ""amber"" or ""white musk"" scents, but rather sophisticated blends that balance warmth and sensuality with freshness and cleanliness.

**Amber Accord:** The amber accord in these perfumes typically consists of a blend of resins, balsams, and vanilla-like ingredients. It provides a warm, sweet, and slightly powdery base that anchors the fragrance and gives it depth. The amber used can vary, from traditional ambers derived from labdanum to more modern synthetic amber notes that offer a cleaner and brighter profile.

The warm and inviting nature of the amber accord is what sets amber white perfumes apart. The quality of the ingredients used significantly impacts the overall scent, with higher-end perfumes using natural resins and extracts for a more authentic and complex aroma.

**White Musk:** The white musk component contributes to the perfume's clean, soft, and slightly soapy character. Unlike heavier, more animalic musks, white musk is lighter and airier, creating a sense of freshness and sophistication. It adds a subtle sweetness that complements the amber accord without overpowering it.

Different types of white musk are used in perfumery, each offering a slightly different nuance. Some white musks are more powdery, while others are more floral or aquatic. The specific type of white musk used in an amber white perfume can greatly influence its overall character.

**Supporting Notes:** Beyond amber and white musk, these perfumes often incorporate a range of supporting notes to enhance their complexity and appeal. These can include floral notes like jasmine or rose, spicy notes like pink pepper or cardamom, or woody notes like sandalwood or cedarwood. These supporting notes add layers of depth and sophistication to the fragrance, making it more interesting and nuanced.

The skillful blending of these supporting notes is crucial in creating a well-balanced amber white perfume. The perfumer must carefully consider how each note interacts with the others to create a harmonious and appealing scent.

**Longevity and Sillage:** Amber white perfumes are generally known for their good longevity and moderate sillage. The warm and resinous nature of the amber accord helps to anchor the fragrance to the skin, allowing it to last for several hours. The white musk contributes to a subtle but noticeable sillage, creating a soft and inviting aura around the wearer.

The longevity and sillage of a perfume can be affected by factors such as skin type, application method, and environmental conditions. However, in general, amber white perfumes offer a good balance between longevity and sillage, making them suitable for both daytime and evening wear.

Key features of amber white perfumes include:
  * Warm and sweet amber accord
  * Clean and soft white musk
  * Complex supporting notes
  * Good longevity and moderate sillage

 ## Core Benefits

Amber white perfumes offer several practical benefits that contribute to their growing popularity among fragrance enthusiasts. These benefits extend beyond simply smelling good, encompassing factors such as versatility, sophistication, and overall appeal.

**Versatility:** One of the key benefits of amber white perfumes is their versatility. They can be worn in a variety of settings, from casual daytime activities to formal evening events. The warm and inviting nature of the amber accord makes them suitable for cooler weather, while the clean and fresh white musk ensures that they are not too heavy or overpowering in warmer climates. This versatility makes them a great option for those who want a signature scent that can be worn year-round.

Their adaptability makes them a good choice for individuals who appreciate a fragrance that can transition seamlessly from one occasion to the next, reflecting their personal style in any environment.

**Sophistication:** Amber white perfumes exude a sense of sophistication and elegance. The complex blend of notes creates a multi-faceted scent that is both intriguing and alluring. They are not simple or one-dimensional fragrances, but rather carefully crafted compositions that evoke a sense of refinement and good taste. This sophistication makes them a popular choice for those who want a perfume that reflects their discerning personality.

The intricate layering of scents within the amber white fragrance profile contributes to an overall impression of elegance and careful consideration. This is a departure from simpler, more straightforward scent profiles, appealing to individuals seeking a more distinguished aroma.

**Long-Lasting Appeal:** The enduring popularity of amber white perfumes stems from their classic and timeless appeal. They are not trendy or fleeting fragrances, but rather scents that have stood the test of time. The warm and inviting nature of the amber accord, combined with the clean and fresh white musk, creates a fragrance that is both comforting and sophisticated. This lasting appeal makes them a worthwhile investment for those who want a perfume that they can enjoy for years to come.

Their timeless nature ensures that they remain relevant and desirable, even as fragrance trends come and go. They offer a sense of familiarity and comfort, while still maintaining a sophisticated and elegant character.

**Creates a Comforting and Inviting Aura:** The blend of warm amber and soft white musk creates a comforting and inviting aura around the wearer. This makes amber white perfumes a great choice for those who want to feel confident and approachable. The scent is not overpowering or aggressive, but rather subtle and alluring, drawing people in without being too assertive.

This subtle yet captivating scent profile makes the wearer more approachable and creates a positive impression, whether in a professional setting or a social gathering.

But here’s the good news: Staying hydrated can be **delicious**. Forget forcing down plain water—I’m sharing **7 flavor-packed tricks**  to make hydration effortless (and Instagram-worthy).

**Why Your Body Becomes a Sponge in Summer**

When temps spike, your body sweats out **water + electrolytes** (sodium, potassium, magnesium) faster than a melting popsicle. Even mild dehydration causes:

* **Energy slumps** (that 3 p.m. coffee craving? Try water first!)
* **Skin tighter than a drum**
* **Pee the color of apple juice** (aim for “light lemonade”)

**Pro Tip:** Aim for **8–10 cups of fluids daily**—but double that if you’re hiking, biking, or sunbathing like a lizard.

**7 Dietitian-Approved Hacks to Hydrate Like a Pro**

**1. The Lazy Girl’s Spa Water**

**“Infuse it, don’t chug it,”**  Toss these combos into a pitcher:

* **Zesty Detox:** Lemon + mint + cucumber
* **Berry Boost:** Strawberries + basil + lime
* **Pro Move:** Freeze herb-and-fruit cubes for Insta-worthy drinks.

**2. Coconut Water: Nature’s Sports Drink**

Skip the neon-colored Gatorade. Coconut water has more potassium than a banana. **“Add lime and Himalayan salt for a cheap electrolyte boost,”**

**3️.  Herbal Iced Tea That’s Not Boring**

Brew hibiscus (lowers blood pressure!) or mint tea, chill, and sweeten with a splash of honey. Serve over crushed ice like a fancy café.

**4️.  Smoothies That Hydrate and Fill You Up**

Blend:

* 1 cup watermelon (92% water!)
* ½ cucumber
* Handful of spinach
* Coconut water + chia seeds (they hold 10x their weight in water!).

**5️. DIY Electrolyte Drink for Pennies**

Mix:

* 1L water
* ¼ tsp sea salt
* ¼ cup lemon juice
* 1 tsp honey.

**Cheaper than Liquid IV and no weird additives**.

**6️.  Agua Fresca**

Blend watermelon or mango with water, strain, add lime, and pour over ice. Tastes like a tropical vacation.

**My Secret Obsession**: lemon juice + water + pinch of salt + roasted cumin powder (trust me, it’s life-changing).

**Bonus:** Freeze herbal tea or blended fruit into popsicles. Perfect for kids—or adults who “forget” to drink water.

**5 Habits That Keep You Hydrated Without Thinking**

* **Snack on “water bombs”:** Cucumber, celery, oranges, watermelon.
* **Ditch the dehydrators:** Alcohol, coffee, and soda suck moisture from your cells.
* **Buy a bottle you’ll want to carry:** Stainless steel with stickers > basic plastic.
* **Set “sip alerts”:** Phone reminders save desk zombies from turning into raisins.
* **Chug before thirst hits:** If you’re thirsty, you’re already behind!

**Dehydration Red Flags (Act Fast!)**

* Urine darker than iced tea.
* Dry mouth or dizzy spells
* Heart racing like you just saw Jason Momoa

**Fix It:** Chug water with a pinch of salt ASAP. If symptoms last, seek help—heatstroke is no joke.

**Final Tip:** Hydration isn’t a chore. It’s a chance to get creative!  Experiment with flavors, carry a stylish bottle , and let water rich foods do some of the work. Your body (and skin) will thank you.

1k4evqp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4evqp,£3 car boot Tamiya Tiger to Heretic heavy tank.,"Bought an incomplete and half built Tamiya Tiger kit for £3 at the Easter Sunday car boot and knocked up a conversion for Warhammer.

It's a bit rough and admittedly looks like it belongs in Konflict 47 not 40k but for three quid I'm pretty pleased with the end result.

Will likely proxy it as an LR Executioner or maybe a Marcharius Omega?

I love Dan Abnetts Description of Traitor vehicles like the AT70 and AT83 tanks so here is some background I wrote for this tank.

The Lygher heavy tank is an antiquated design originally manufactured on Chambaris and popular with PDF forces and militia units in the Theunis subsector chiefly for its price and availability.

Although nearly twice the size and mass it is only comparable to a Leman Russ in terms of armour protection and it lacks the combat range and reliability of the venerable imperial machine, factors less important for second line defensive forces.

More importantly perhaps, the Lygher and it's variants lack gyro stabilisation of its main weapon or any advanced auspex beyond a effective day/night fire control sight for the gunner.

In the hands of an experienced crew or used en masse these heavy tanks can still be an effective battlefield tool but are far outclassed by the Leman Russ, let alone the Rogal Dorn battle tank that it is a direct analogue to.

The standard battle tank is armed with a heavy Lascannon in the turret and two stubbers, one coaxial and the second hull mounted, whilst this makes it a genuine threat against armour, it lacks any high explosive capacity for dealing with emplaced positions and dug in infantry.
A flamethrower was offered as an option to replace the hull mounted heavy stubber in an effort to mitigate this. Other common additions included a pintle mounted weapon on the commanders hatch and a light mortar in the turret roof for firing signal and illumination flares.

Many other variants were produced including the Patheros, which mounted an Earthshaker cannon in a casemate; and the Ocelot, fitted with a heavy plasma cannon in a general support role.
This variant had many drawbacks, not least of which was the fact the main plasma mount could only be reloaded by the crew exiting the safety of the vehicle to replace the plasma flasks. Fully loaded the cannon could only fire up to half a dozen salvos before retiring to rearm from it's internal stores.

When Chambaris fell to the Hosts of Jhar the Depravator circa 182.m42, the tank manufactories were estimated by imperial tacticians to have produced over Seven thousand hulls during the occupation, enough to fully outfit several of the Depravator's warbands.

Fitted with a heavy flamer in the hull as well as a pintle bolter, this particular Ocelot was encounted on the colony world of Baskine, as part of an armoured brigade operated by the Heretic warhost known as the Remade. 

Operating in support of an enemy counterattack at the Folgar crossing this vehicle inflicted terrible casualties on the 4th company of the 67th San Saro Light Las, wiping amount most of 3rd, 6th and 7th platoon in a series of attacks that latest most of a morning and eventually routed 4th company from the southern end of the crossing. 

Recorded as destroyed the next day by tanks of 3 squadron, 9th Vostokk when the Imperial advance resumed with the support of armoured units from the 9th and heavy infantry from the 32nd Lesterian Fusiliers.

I'm **29 years old** and have a **sedentary office job**, so I sit most of the day. I wanted to share my situation and see if anyone's had a similar experience.

My symptoms first showed up around **February**, pretty randomly, right after I started adding **squats and deadlifts** into my gym routine. Since then, I’ve been experiencing **occasional bright red blood in my stool** and **pain in the anal area after bowel movements**. The pain isn’t constant, but when it flares up, it's pretty uncomfortable.

Google keeps telling me that hemorrhoids should heal within a few weeks, but when I browse through posts and personal stories, it seems like they can drag on a lot longer in some cases.

Also, I was wondering about **diet**. Do I need to stick to a stricter “healing diet” for a longer period of time for things to actually get better?

Because for the past two weeks, I was doing really well – no blood, smooth bowel movements, no pain. I slowly started reintroducing things like coffee, then a little more coffee, and finally had a beer… and the next day, the pain and bleeding came back.

My family mixed a bunch of recipes together over a decade (don’t know which) and created this mix between regular white bread and brioche that they then wrap sausages/hot dogs in a braided style. The bread always came out super fluffy and soft with a good amount of pull and chewiness to it. It was my favorite comfort food as a kid. No I have the recipe, but don’t have my family anymore, and I don’t know much about baking, so adjusting it to Gluten free (wife has hashimoto’s) failed miserably. I used the recipe I remember my dad mentioning, which he got from a Tunisian chef on a Middle Eastern channel called Fatafeat.

I tracked down the recipe:

-500g of all purpose flour (I used GF flour)
-40g Sugar
-250ml Milk
-Tablespoon Instant Yeast
-2 Eggs
-Unspecified amount of butter (looked to be about 80g)
-Teaspoon Salt

Mixing dry ingredients, adding salt last so it doesn’t interfere with the yeast. Add wet ingredients. Kneaded by hand for 15-20 mins then let it rise. Instantly I noticed that the dough consistency and color was different, it started off very sticky, so I added more flour until it felt more like what I remember. It was also very yellow for some reason. After it more than doubled in size, it became very weird, more like pastry or biscuit dough than bread dough. After baking it, it came out exactly like a KFC biscuit…


I really want my wife to try these modified “pigs in a blanket” but I have no idea where to even start with making it gluten free (IF the flour was the only thing that was the issue, BIG IF). I added a picture of what they’re supposed to look like, or at least the closest I could find. My family’s was usually puffier and darker on top since my mom added coffee to the egg wash.

1k4ep48,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k4ep48/could_the_keurig_ksupreme_coffee_maker_review/,Could the Keurig K-Supreme Coffee Maker Review Change Your Morning Routine?,"Testing and reviewing the Keurig K-Supreme Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker has been quite the adventure in my coffee-loving life. As a frequent coffee drinker with a busy schedule, finding a reliable, efficient, and easy-to-use coffee maker has always been a priority for me. This product, with its sleek and modern design, seems to tick plenty of boxes, but like any gadget, it’s not without its quirks. Here’s how it stacks up based on my experience and testing.  

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unboxed the Keurig K-Supreme, its modern and compact design caught my eye. The black finish meshes well with almost any kitchen aesthetic, including mine. The dimensions (10.12""D x 14.84""W x 14.41""H) make it a countertop-friendly appliance while still feeling substantial enough in quality to last. The inclusion of a removable 66oz dual-position reservoir is a big perk, especially in small kitchens with limited counter real estate. The reservoir can be repositioned depending on your setup, which is super handy for maximizing workspace.  

**User-Friendly Features**  
I appreciate how intuitive the controls are. Just popping in a K-Cup pod and hitting the appropriate brew button makes it nearly foolproof. Brewing choices include multiple sizes ranging from 6oz to 12oz, which is perfect for small cups in the morning or travel mugs on rushed days. I mostly used the “Strong” brew button for my daily caffeine dose. It does deliver a more pronounced coffee flavor, though hardcore espresso lovers might find it a touch milder. The travel mug-friendly feature (accommodating mugs up to 7"" tall) came in handy when I was dashing out the door.  

**Key Benefits**  
- The MultiStream Technology extracts noticeably full-bodied flavors and aromas, making a much more satisfying cup of coffee.  
- Quick operation ensures fresh-brewed coffee in a matter of minutes, saving time on busy mornings.  
- The removable tank and travel mug compatibility cater to convenience and versatility.  

[Check Keurig K-Supreme K-Supreme price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0892tw82k/)

**Coffee Brewing Performance**  
Over a few weeks of use, I ran the Keurig K-Supreme through multiple paces. Whether it was brewing tea, coffee, or attempting iced coffee, this machine delivered consistent results. The hot-over-ice brewing option deserves special mention. While it won't give you barista-level iced coffee, it does provide a solid shortcut for a refreshing drink. The MultiStream Technology plays a vital role in ensuring even saturation of the coffee grounds inside the K-Cup pods, which noticeably improved the aroma and depth of flavor compared to older Keurig models I’ve used.  

One of the most satisfying experiences was how quickly it brewed back-to-back. There’s no long wait time for the machine to reheat, making it perfect for entertaining guests or when my partner and I both needed coffee at the same time.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Lacks advanced features like a milk frother or programmable settings.  
- No digital clock or timer feature, which some competitors offer.   
- Plastic construction feels sturdy but might not appeal to anyone expecting a premium finish.  

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing this model to its competitors, such as the Nespresso Vertuo Next or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, highlights its strengths and limitations. The Nespresso excels in producing strong, café-quality espresso shots, but it falls short in brewing a regular-strength coffee. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach model allows more versatility with ground coffee and K-Cup pods, but its brewing process takes longer, and the flavor output feels less robust. In this aspect, the Keurig K-Supreme offers a balanced middle-ground—it’s faster and provides consistent flavor without needing advanced barista knowledge.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
When considering the cost relative to its features, I’d say the Keurig K-Supreme holds up well. Some might argue that traditional drip machines or multi-use brewers offer more bang for the buck, but those miss out on the sheer convenience and speed this product provides. The sleek design and user-oriented features add value, though coffee aficionados seeking high-end extras might lean towards pricier options.

Recovery has been pretty smooth. Once the dry tampon feeling passed, I was able to walk fairly regularly. My gynecologist said that during my surgery he did take off a few spots of endometriosis he found and though I only had a few small fibroids and my uterus was only slightly  enlarged, it was very inflamed and was very tough to even cut through. Here's where I am now:
   -I have reorganized my kitchen and built a large flower bed in our yard. Yes, my husband did the heavy lifting,  but I had the energy to get up and do it! It was amazing! I did have to stop and take a lot of breaks while doing it, but I did it! 
   - I'm pooping. Regularly. It's freaking awesome. Before surgery I was constantly bloated and was lucky to have a BM every 3 days or so. Now, I have  my morning coffee and within half an hour I'm ready to poop. Maybe tmi, but my actual stools are smooth and perfect, not all over the scale like pre-surgery. 
   -I've been a type 1 diabetic for 37 years, a1c always in the low 6 range. When my issues started, my a1c hit 7 and no matter how much insulin or exercise or carb cutting I did, I could not get below 7. Endocrinologist didn't believe it was my angry uterus, even though I could graph my menstrual cycle and cgm graphs and they perfectly matched. Now, I've dropped my insulin usage by 1/3 and my numbers stay in range all day. 
   -I've only lost 5 pounds, but without the insane bloating,  I can wear my jeans again.

1k4eok3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1k4eok3/anyones_siblings_arguably_worse_than_the_parents/,Anyone's sibling(s) arguably worse than the parents?,"I have a much older brother who is married and has a toddler. Ever since my nephew was born, my parents have been babysitting him all the time. My brother and his wife both work from home and the kid goes to daycare, but they pick him up early and they drop him off for the rest of day to one of the 2 sets of grandparents, as they interchange. I have no idea why they even have to babysit him. My parents used to be happy to do it - until my nephew became a complete menace. My brother and his wife spoiled that kid rotten, he doesn't listen to anyone, he's argumentative and constantly screaming (he's 3.5 yo btw) and my parents are exhausted from him. 

But the worst part - instead of being grateful, my brother is constantly giving them shit. He tells them that everything they do is wrong, yells at them if they gave him a single piece of candy, lectures them on parenting when his child is a literal demon with no manners at all. I have stepped in multiple times to defend my parents, knowing they'd never do the same for me.

I personally hate him in general because I can't stand to be around him. He scares me. He's argumentative and constantly trying to be the smartest person in the room when he knows absolutely nothing about what he is saying. He will literally tell you you're stupid and don't know what you're talking about just because he disagrees on something. He cannot stand when I present him with facts and will still tell me I have no idea what I'm saying. He watches everything I do and will yell at me for ""boiling the water in the kettle for too long"" or for using boiling hot water with coffee when it's only supposed to be JUST hot, or that I used too much soap to wash my hands, or whatever you could think of - he's criticized it. 

I don't know how or why my parents put up with him. He will literally scold my dad who tries to deflect with jokes but that just makes him even worse, until I step in. I don't know why they never told him to fuck off and go home or stop coming by and leaving his spawn here to be babysat. My brother oftentimes works from our house while my parents babysit, and they all also come by over the weekends for free lunches. They just switch what set of grandparents they're seeing on which day. They take naps in the living room and we aren't allowed to disturb them. 

My parents are something else, but my brother is somehow ten times worse than them. His wife is a total enabler who is enamored with him for some reason. And their child is so far horribly raised and has had many health problems too but they're convinced they're doing everything right. 

And the worst part is - I have no idea where it all went wrong. When I was a small child my brother took me everywhere with him, he picked me up from daycare, he took care of me whenever mom couldn't. He bought me things and spoiled me. He loved me. And then we grew up and now he is horrible to me. I don't understand what happened but now I despise him, much more than my narcissistic parents. ",7,1745245179.0,raisedbynarcissists,4,0.9,False

Why is the research of the former Kakhovka Reservoir territories important?  
The restoration of natural landscapes on the former Kakhovka Reservoir is not just a miracle of nature—it is a crucial process that must be studied. We have a unique opportunity to gather invaluable scientific data on ecosystem recovery after a catastrophe of unprecedented scale.  
However, hidden threats may be lurking beneath this revival. This is not hype or fearmongering—it is a warning based on existing evidence. For decades, heavy metals, industrial waste, petroleum products, and chemical compounds accumulated in the reservoir’s sediments. Now, no longer sealed underwater, these contaminants may be affecting the soil, water, biodiversity, and even human health.  
To prevent long-term environmental threats, we must not only document the current state but also conduct long-term, regular observations. Only through years of continuous research can we predict potential risks and take timely action to protect nature and people.

In Pt II I picked up 3 special order oil samples from Ajevie, a few more EDP samples directly from Sorce, and re-sample everything in Part I. Will I finally understand the MMIH hype? Let's get to it:

SPECIAL ORDER:

**Her Kind** (Ajevie, oil): I don’t know what I’m supposed to be smelling, but I’m not smelling much. Just the barest hint of amber and musky sweetness and - that’s it? I do have some trouble smelling musks like JHAG Not a Perfume so maybe this musk molecule is just too big for my nose or I got a bad sample.  Either way, I don’t think the problem is “rest.” This is just…kind of a non-perfume for me. ***Notes:*** *Musk, amber, sandalwood, Cashmeran, benzoin, vanilla, myrrh co2, wisps of smoke* 3/10

**Dreaming Evi**l (Ajevie, oil): I guess evil smells like chocolate? More specifically, this smells like the raw shea butter that I used to rub all over my skin in the winter. It’s a shimmery cocoa butter note and a backbone of vanilla. It’s nice! But I can help but feel like it’s missing some sparkle or some spice or something. This is fine but too basic for my weirdo tastes. ***Notes:*** *Vanilla, tonka bean, labdanum, benzoin, cocoa, oud, treemoss, dark woods* 6/10

**Your Girlfriend is a Badass** (Ajevie, oil): This is a lovely cake scent with chocolate frosting but I am not getting the purported dirt note at all. I put this wrist to wrist with **Black Forest** from Solstice Scents and honestly **Black Forest** is just…better. Richer. Darker. Cakier. Sharper. **Your Girlfriend** seems mellow and downright store-bought by comparison, and fades away even faster than **Black Forest**. I like this but it just leaves me wanting more, you know? ***Notes:*** *Yellow cake with a rich fudge frosting, Himalayan cedarwood, oakmoss, and forest floor.* 6/10

REGULAR CATALOG:

**Dark Skies** (EDP): Whoever said this smelled like packing tape, I can totally see that! This was pungent and extremely hard for me to get my head around in the beginning. I’ve read a lot of reviews for this and generally people say “this is hard to describe!” and then don’t give any description, so I’m going to give it a shot. There’s a packing tape sharpness which shares the same DNA as an artificial berry scent - blueberry? But also herbs and a dusty spice? A hint of licorice? The original pungent, almost plasticky note fades quickly and then there’s a sweet woody vanilla behind it. When I reference the notes I have no idea what is giving it the packing-tape-blueberry smell, or the dusty spice smell, but I can definitely pick out the sage and vanilla. I don’t really know what tuberose or saguaro smell on their own but the whole combo is incredibly distinct and unlike anything else I’ve smelled. This is kind of like eating a piece of licorice and toasting a blueberry pop-tart while a bundle of sage is burning in the other room. This was recommended to me as a sister scent to **Serpentine**, but I think it’s actually closer to **The Lovers** because the dry down is soft and green (with hints of vanilla?) I didn’t know if I liked this at first but I kept reaching for it and now I think I might love it. My husband didn’t get the blueberry-packing-tape note at all, only saying that it was “sweet” and “floral.” I think out of 200+ fragrances I’ve smelled, this is the first floral that has really stopped me in my tracks. Not a safe blind buy though! ***Notes:*** *Desert sage, agave, tuberose, saguaro, sandalwood, vanilla* 9/10

**2 AM in Lafayette** (EDP): Okay, I totally get the stale coffee allegations. It starts off as creamy coffee, and then goes through a rather bitter this-has-been-sitting-in-the-pot-in-the-breakroom phase for a while. I’ve read a lot of reviews for this one so I wasn’t sniffing blind and I know there’s oakmoss in here somewhere; I can’t detect it outright but I wonder if that’s some of the reason for the weirdly realistic staleness. Surprisingly, almost as quickly as it had shifted into stale coffee mode, it shifted OUT of stale coffee mode into something that was an inoffensive, sweet, vaguely nutty coffee scent. I think my brain is confusing the caramel note with some kind of hazelnut flavored coffee blend I used to get at Wawa on the way into work (iykyk). It’s nice, but the stale coffee phase makes me think this could be a bit temperamental on the skin. At the very end of the day I’m getting something ever so slightly bready, which I think are the beignets. This is nice, no complaints except for the weird stale part, but I don’t know if it’s a must-have for my collection.  ***Notes***: *Vanilla co2, oakmoss, cafe au lait, ribbons of caramel, beignets dusted with powdered sugar* 7.5/10

**The Bees**: When I first sampled this my brain went something like “oooooh…mmm…OH! Oh? Uh oh.” as I rifled through my numerous half-baked reactions. While wet it's powdery, it’s floral, it’s like the honey note in Serpentine and then it isn’t anymore, it’s realistic natural organic honey, it’s…a lot of things. Although I initially felt like this was choking me out earlier in the day while in a car, it did fade respectably over the next few hours but hung on to that stubborn powdery note. My husband specifically dislikes this one and says there’s “honey, but something sour.” There’s so much going on in the notes that I can’t make head or tail of it, except that I think I’m picking up on the powder of the iris. I thought this would be one of  my favorites but I think I will have to lump this into the “not for me” category. ***Notes***: *Egyptian jasmine absolute, honey extract\*, pollen, iris, myrrh, mimosa absolute, fresh cream, cedar, petrichor* 5/10

RESTING UPDATE: ([from Review Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1jcrt1l/sorce_yet_another_review_rec_request/))

**Match Made in Heaven** (EDP): If y’all remember, I could barely smell anything at all, and sadly had to give this a low rating. Well, about a month+ later I have to admit I can actually SMELL this fragrance now, and it’s a delicious, light, floral, cherry blossom ice cream with a slight waxy undertone (which I think is the matcha) with the Sorce cookie dough base. It’s still very light but it exists and it’s delicious. I was a resting skeptic but Y’ALL WERE RIGHT OKAY. There’s not much projection here, but I’m considering a FS because I find myself craving that weird little wax note underneath all that vague floral ice cream. *UPDATED RATING: 8.5/10*

EDIT: I received a freebie sample of MMIH and the oil is way more potent on day 1 than the EDP was for the first month. I’m usually an EDP gal but for Sorce might have to switch over to oils to get that longevity that I’m after?

**The Cookie Party** (EDP): On my first go-around I got a strong Play Doh scent upon application which I really disliked. After a month, I’m not getting that at all - just a very assertive toffee version of the Sorce cookie dough base. This one continues to have really good throw and longevity, but now it’s almost at the point where I feel like I’m conspicuously cookie-scented while out in public. Without that weird Play Doh phase I have no choice but to bump up the rating.  *UPDATED RATING 7.5/10*

**Strings of Light in the Forest** (EDP)**:**  The lavender is much more present now but much less citrusy. The longevity and projection are still not great, but it does last at least a few hours on my skin and that’s definitely an upgrade from when I first tested it out. Like MMIH this feels airy and elegant, but I don’t know if I’m an airy and elegant person, y’know?  *UPDATED RATING 7/10*

**No real updates to report for Snow Moon Magic, Serpentine, Venus in Fleurs, Where the Wild Things Grow, the Lovers, or Fuckery.**

Well, fuck my back account is all I can say. I already FS'd Serpentine, but have no choice but to FS Dark Skies, MMIH, Snow Moon Magic (because I messed up my previous order and accidentally bought Moon Magic instead whoops), and have already picked out my blind buys for the special order window which will be Between the Sheets and UFO Disco.
