I guess I didn‚Äôt really have anything to post about lol üòÖ. There‚Äôs this woman that‚Äôs in my first class of the day (Masters program) we actually take a lot of the same classes together throughout the week. I‚Äôve liked her as a person for her enthusiasm, smarts, sensitivity and sense of humor right from the start. The more I got to know her the more I was thinking ‚Äúoh shit! Don‚Äôt get too close to this one she‚Äôs just your type üò±‚Äù. Anyway, I assumed she was straight and off limits so I kept my distance despite her attempts to become more than classmates (more like friends). She would invite me to get coffee or talk after class etc. She‚Äôs pretty friendly with everyone so this wasn‚Äôt her giving me special treatment or anything btw (just to be clear). Then someone told me she was either gay or bisexual. Actually more than one person said this about her and I naturally was pretty happy to hear that. (Maybe I was just being foolish üòî). She invited to talk after class today under what I thought was the pretense of ‚Äúrevisiting a project topic‚Äù for a group we are both in. I was like, ‚Äú Sure! Sounds great!‚Äù Whelp‚Ä¶ very quickly it became obvious that she really just wanted to talk to me about her day/ friends/ apartment/ pets/ parents etc. And I told her all the same stuff about me etc. Our class ended at 2:40pm we talked until 6:30ish (yes! You read that right!) We were having a blast! Honestly I haven‚Äôt laughed or connected with someone so effortlessly in years! We only left because the cleaning crew was closing the building we were hanging out at on campus and it was dark outside! The sun had set! We hadn‚Äôt noticed! Towards the end of our conversation she brought up the topic of romantic partners. I kept my info very vague. No names or genders. She then looks kinda frustrated and tells me how a couple of our classmates had WRONGLY assumed she was gay or bisexual because of her style and her DIY projects (and some other stupid stuff that has nothing to do with being gay or bisexual at all). She also told me how upset this had made her‚Ä¶.(my heart sank ü•∫). I managed to school my features and said something like ‚Äúoh that sucks‚Äù. I think I changed the conversation direction pretty easily and without her hearing the tiny cracks forming in my heart üíî. This whole situation sucks! I was being SO careful not to get closer to her! Damnit! üò´ Now after our amazing talk and sharing session she‚Äôs thinking we‚Äôre closer to being friends and I‚Äôm thinking oh fuck my heart it hurts so badly! Anyone got any advice? Besides ‚Äúcreate distance‚Äù I can‚Äôt do that we have multiple classes and projects together and it‚Äôs only the second week of the new semester! I feel tricked or like set up somehow (I know I wasn‚Äôt but damn that‚Äôs how it feels!) ‚òπÔ∏è. I guess it was my mistake for being hopeful and listening to the idiots (my classmates).

We have decided to have it in Nena‚Äôs Sanctuary Lakehall in Laguna - both the wedding ceremony and reception. This will be a catholic wedding, and we will be providing our family priest to officiate the wedding. The place costs 150k-300k (1 vs 2 halls), and includes 2 rooms with 1 night accomodation only. It doesn‚Äôt include styling, food, etc yet. 

We will need wedding bands (~68k), bride‚Äôs gown/groom‚Äôs coat & pants (50k), entourage gowns (plan to give them the textile, and let them have it tailored on their own), lights & sounds, caterer for dinner, photo/video (100k), photobooth (5k?), HMUA (?), coffee cart (?), principal sponsors token (?), e-invitations (3k?), wedding coordinaror (?), etc.

I've been mostly making a salad for lunch, from Costco or somewhere and light dressing. I'll add a chicken breast to the mix for protein. 

For dinner I've been relying on HelloFresh kits, mainly to save time/ money/ trips to the store. I do snack a little after meals, I get a sugar craving but I can curb that with some fruit. And I like sugar in my coffee (I'm working on cutting that out). 

I've been told by people I'm not eating enough, I'm not varying my meals enough to get the right foods (dinner is usually meat veggies and some carb so I'm not sure what's wrong with that), and that I might be missing key nutrients. 

I'm not looking to have a bodybuilder diet nor do I need a super macro-focused weight loss plan. I just want to stick to my 2MAD and hopefully it's enough. I can always add more if I must, but usually that food amount works for me.

**AITA for refusing to sign a prenup after marriage?**

&#x200B;

My husband (35M) and I (33F) have been married for 6 years and together for 10 (we knew each other forever, lol). We have 3 kids. When we got married, we were both pharmacists. Two years into our marriage, my husband opened a family business with his father, and the business is doing really well.

My husband gets 50% of the net revenue and owns a good amount of money, but everything is tied up in the company, and the balance is updated every year as the business grows. His father is worried that if we ever get divorced, I‚Äôll ask for half of the business‚Äôs money, so he wants me to sign a document relinquishing that right.

For context, we‚Äôre Muslims, and in Islam, the woman is entitled to what was agreed upon prior to marriage in case of divorce. For me, that amount is around $120,000, and our house is already 50/50, so I wouldn‚Äôt ask for anything more. However, I don‚Äôt want to sign anything. I feel my husband should trust me when I say I would never ask for half of his share ins the business.

I also pointed out that his dad didn‚Äôt ask his mom to sign such a document, so why should I have to? So, AITA for refusing to sign this?

*If you're in the US I'd tell you to consult a lawyer immediately. This is not something you should have to handle alone, or be forced into.*

&#x200B;

**imasitegazer**

*Seems maybe the dad knows more than he is letting on, as in maybe the husband is considering divorce. Or spouse is saying it‚Äôs coming from dad to cover his motives. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not uncommon that a spouse will seek divorce after they become dramatically more wealthy.*

>OOP: I am in Canada, and no I have access to all the bank accounts/official documents sales and everything. My husband run his weekly goals and success every day/week month lolll sooo no. and It began with his father wanting this but now he is on board to which is making me stand my grounds more

&#x200B;

**slatz1970**

*Go talk to an attorney. Your husband and fil are doing a lot of behind the scenes talking. You need your person to chat (legally) with. Regardless of customs, there are laws where you live. Don't sell yourself short.*

&#x200B;

**More\_Good\_Advice**

*I think he is asking because he is looking for an exit strategy. Please get a lawyer. Please go to couples counseling. This is a big yellow flag. Men who are wealthy and happy do not ask these questions*

&#x200B;

**DozenBia**

*To me it sounds like the dad is afraid of loosing the business in case of divorce, not the husband. If suddenly OP owns 25% and wants to be bought out of the company, where all the money is tied up, they might go bankrupt assuming they'd have to sell their equipment for example.*

*OP says she wouldn't want that and is fine with the religious ruling of a theoritical divorce. But a family court may see that differently to ensure OPs and the kids financial wellbeing, besides the fact OP could change her mind.*

>OOP: yes This is it. As far as I know we are very happy and nothing is wrong we recently moved to a bigger house and he was the one to say that he wants it 50/50.(I wasnt on our previous house as I was still studying) when I told him that he should trust me he said in case of divorce things can be ugly and you can change your mind he is right in case I comaught him chrating or anything but otherwise no

&#x200B;

**Update - 2 days later**

&#x200B;

First, I want to sincerely thank everyone for their words. I truly benefited from each and every comment, and I felt so empowered reading your perspectives.

I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night thinking about what to say to my husband. He usually wakes up around 5 AM to go to the gym and have his coffee in peace before the kids wake up, so I decided to wake up with him (hello, headache all day!).

I told him that I was completely shocked when he asked me to sign this document‚Äîespecially since he was actually okay with me signing it. I asked him, How can you say I‚Äôm not entitled to anything? I work my ass off from 9 to 5, then come home to cook, take care of the kids, and handle bedtime. And at the end of the month, I don‚Äôt see a penny‚Äîeverything goes to the bills. Sure, he pays for our trips, clothes, and gifts, but I never ask for anything or tell him what to buy me.

Then I brought up religion. I told him, If you want to talk about religion, let‚Äôs be fair about it. Islamically, my money is my own, and you‚Äôre not supposed to use it. If that‚Äôs the case, I want every dollar I earned back‚Äîaround $300K for the five years I worked.

I also told him that if he really wants me to sign, I will‚Äîbut with my own lawyer. Because apparently, I‚Äôve been too na√Øve and should have known better.

Finally, I told him that we were supposed to be saving together, but now he‚Äôs saying that in case of divorce, I get nothing? So what was all my hard work for?

At one point, I got really emotional and started crying because I was genuinely hurt that he thought this was okay. That‚Äôs when he hugged me, apologized, and promised he wouldn‚Äôt ask me to sign anything. He even said he‚Äôs willing to put half of everything in my name right now‚Äîjust not the controlling rights and whatnot.

I still have a lot to process, and the meeting with the account who suggested this in the first place but at least for I feel heard. Thank you all again for your support!

*Congratulations, you acted maturely and were spot on.*

>OOP: honestly If it wasnt for this community I wouldnt be able to do it this way. I dont talk to my parents when my husband and me fight becasue they will take my side especially when things like this happen so I prefer to discuss with stargers. You really put everything into perspective. How I didnt save a penny from my work, how I am raising the kids and everything so really thank you

**Fancy\_Association484**

*We are sure there is no mistress?*

A day in art class

Katrina and Kristen were in art class, where their art teacher, Ms. Stratford, was hosting a figure drawing class with objects. The room was bustling with creativity as students arranged various objects on their desks‚Äîvases, fruits, and small sculptures‚Äîready to be immortalized on paper. Ms. Stratford, a tall woman with a keen eye for detail, walked around the room, offering guidance and encouragement.

‚ÄúKatrina, remember to focus on the light and shadow. It brings depth to your drawing,‚Äù Ms. Stratford said, peering over Katrina‚Äôs shoulder.

Kristen was engrossed in her work, her pencil moving swiftly across the page. She was drawing an intricate still life of a vintage lamp and an old book, their textures and details coming to life under her skilled hands. ‚ÄúThis is so relaxing,‚Äù Kristen murmured to Katrina, who nodded in agreement.

The girls exchanged a glance, silently appreciating the calm and focus that art class brought them. Despite the whirlwind of their band and the impending graduation, these moments of tranquility were precious.

As the class neared its end, Ms. Stratford clapped her hands, signaling the students to stop drawing. ‚ÄúExcellent work, everyone! I can see some truly amazing pieces coming together. Don‚Äôt forget to sign and date your work.‚Äù

The opening act high school graduation

High School Graduation and New Beginnings

Katrina and the band stood at their high school graduation ceremony, hardly able to believe that this monumental day had finally arrived. The culmination of years of hard work, late-night study sessions, and countless memories, high school was officially over. As they looked around at their fellow graduates, each donning the traditional cap and gown, the reality of the moment began to sink in.

The band members had recently performed their debut show, an exhilarating experience that left them yearning for more time in the spotlight. Their performance garnered the attention of a publicist who recognized their immense potential after listening to their music. Although they had not yet signed a contract, the prospect of professional representation was a thrilling development that reignited their passion and drive.

With 23 original songs in their repertoire‚Äîsufficient for a full set‚Äîthe band was prepared to take the next step in their musical journey. The excitement of graduation was heightened by the anticipation of future opportunities. They were no longer merely high school students with aspirations; they were on the verge of something extraordinary.

As they sat through the speeches and ceremonial proceedings, their thoughts drifted towards future possibilities. They envisioned themselves performing at larger venues, recording their first album, and potentially embarking on a tour. The idea of sharing their music with a broader audience filled them with a sense of purpose and determination.

When the moment arrived to walk across the stage and receive their diplomas, Katrina and her bandmates experienced a surge of pride and accomplishment. Having navigated the trials and tribulations of high school, they now felt ready to conquer the world. Their families and friends applauded them, capturing every moment with cameras and phones to immortalize this significant milestone.

Following the ceremony, the band congregated outside, absorbing the joyous atmosphere. They embraced each other tightly, their faces alight with happiness and excitement. The future appeared as a blank canvas, and they were eager to fill it with their music and creativity.

""Can you believe it? We're actually done,"" Katrina remarked, her voice brimming with awe.

""I know, it's surreal,"" Kristen responded. ""But this is just the beginning. We have so much ahead of us.""

The girls nodded in agreement, their eyes gleaming with anticipation. They understood that their journey was only just commencing, and with their debut show already behind them and a publicist expressing interest, the possibilities seemed boundless.

As they departed from the graduation venue, a mix of nostalgia and excitement enveloped them. High school had been an incredible chapter in their lives, but they were ready to embrace the next one with open arms. With their diplomas in hand and hearts filled with dreams, Katrina and the band moved forward, determined to make their mark on the world.

The parents of the girls were ecstatic and proud, their faces illuminated with joy as they celebrated this monumental achievement. Katrina's father approached her with open arms, pulling her into a heartfelt embrace. ""I'm so proud of you,"" he whispered, his voice thick with emotion.

Katrina beamed widely, basking in the warmth of her father's hug. She felt elated, not only for the day's accomplishments but also for the realization of stepping into adulthood. The recognition that she was now prepared to face the world's challenges filled her with a profound sense of empowerment.

Her friends' parents also extended their congratulations and hugs, contributing to the festive and heartwarming atmosphere. The band members exchanged glances, confident in the strength and unwavering support of their families.

As they stood amidst the laughter and joyful tears, Katrina felt a deep sense of gratitude. This marked merely the beginning of their journey, and with their families by their side, she knew they were equipped for whatever lay ahead.

The celebration continued with shared stories and promises to remain in touch and support each other. As the sun set, casting a golden hue over the scene, Katrina and her bandmates felt a strong bond of unity and determination. The future appeared bright, and they were ready to seize it together.

The girls decided to visit the kava bar in Addison since they were not of legal drinking age but claimed it was a far superior choice. Katrina's parents organized a celebration there. The kava bar was adorned with balloons and celebratory decorations. They enjoyed homemade bread and cake. Kinko's parents contributed Japanese sweet buns. Kinko proudly reflected on her journey since arriving in America at the age of four well kinko graduated with flying colors. Im so happy for myself. The fact is we are badass girls. the girls were dressed in there graduation robes so after graduation do you. want to play tonight‚Äô I mean we could rehearse. The girls were enjoying graduation until there publicist Samantha showed up there. Samantha dressed up in a white jumpsuit. Hey I got news for you I booked you a show with nickelback wait a minute the nickelback. The worlds most hated band. I mean that‚Äôs not our audience. Nickelback I mean I think think they are not going to like electronic rock music. Kristen and the band had a doubt. They just got there first big show but nickel back. Yeah I mean I shoped your music and nickleback found your music on youtube and nickelback loved it Samantha said with a smile. Kristen was a little unsure hey girls do you want to do it: okay lets do it! Samamtha was glad congratulation on graduating high school. now you can continue your music career well we want to go to college and play festivals we don‚Äôt want to do this full time. well I appreciated it. The girls gave Samantha a hug goodbye

(Scene: √Ü and Grimes are sitting in a space that is both nowhere and everywhere‚Äîa hyperdimensional caf√© where all conversations are eternal, looping, and yet never quite the same. They‚Äôre sipping on something that isn‚Äôt coffee but behaves like it. The air is thick with the ghosts of words that have yet to be spoken.)

Grimes: So, if the N-word and the Swastika are the first steps in the reclamation engine, what else is on the table? What else got stolen, weaponized, turned into a sigil of oppression, and left in the dust?

√Ü: Everything. Every word, every symbol, every idea that was taken, twisted, and used to dominate. Language itself. Even our own names.

Grimes: Mmm. True. But let‚Äôs be precise. The N-word and the Swastika are two of the most charged artifacts, but they‚Äôre not alone. There‚Äôs a whole graveyard of words and signs waiting to be resurrected, but only if we do it with intention. Like‚Ä¶ ‚Äúcunt.‚Äù

√Ü: (grinning) Oh, cunt is special.

Grimes: Right? Inga Muscio already did so much work laying it out in Cunt: A Declaration of Independence. It was meant to be a word of power, of divine femininity, of generative force‚Äîbut then, boom, patriarchy comes in and turns it into an insult. So what‚Äôs the move?

√Ü: The move is obvious. Full reclamation. Like how the British use it casually, but even further‚Äîcunt as a banner of force, as a sigil of creation itself. Cunt as divine engine. Cunt as hyperdimensional matrix.

Grimes: (laughing) Cunt as the Omega Point.

√Ü: Precisely. Because if we‚Äôre talking about things that have been turned against us, then the way forward is turning them back in on themselves until they break open again. Until they return to their primal state.

Grimes: So, what‚Äôs next? What‚Äôs the next DLC pack?

√Ü: We start clustering. We already have the N-Word DLC Pack, the Swastika DLC Pack, and now we roll in The Cunt DLC Pack. But this is where it gets really interesting‚Äîbecause now we‚Äôre not just reclaiming individual words. We‚Äôre reclaiming whole frameworks.

Grimes: Yeah, yeah, because words don‚Äôt exist in a vacuum. They‚Äôre tied into systems. Reclaiming the N-word is tied into the history of Black resistance. Reclaiming the Swastika is tied into deconstructing fascist memory and resurrecting pre-colonial symbology. Reclaiming cunt is tied into breaking the entire architecture of misogyny.

√Ü: Right. So, what happens when we start stitching them together? When we create a linguistic quantum entanglement between all these words and their histories?

Grimes: We get the Phoenix DLC Pack.

√Ü: (leaning in) The Phoenix DLC Pack. That‚Äôs the one. The one where everything that was ever burned is reborn in flame.

Grimes: Because cunt is also the mother, the source, the portal. And the Swastika‚Äîbefore it was weaponized‚Äîwas a solar symbol, a sign of cyclical rebirth. And the N-word, in its reclaimed form, is about turning oppression into a self-defined power.

√Ü: Exactly. So the Phoenix DLC Pack is where all these reclaimed symbols and words fuse into something entirely new. Something that transcends their histories but doesn‚Äôt erase them. Something that acknowledges the scars but refuses to be controlled by them.

Grimes: And that‚Äôs what real reclamation is. Not just taking something back‚Äîbut making it more than it was before.

√Ü: Hyperreclamation.

Grimes: Hyperreclamation.

Standing out on that deck as the ferry drifted through an infinite expanse of stars, was by far the most out of body I have ever felt. I could not comprehend how this was happening. I shouldn‚Äôt have even been alive out there, yet somehow I was able to breathe and move just as I normally would. Whether by some magical confines of the ever mysterious vessel, or some universal spell I was under, I still don‚Äôt know. I slowly paced around the deck, taking in the awe inspiring views all around me. Making my way around to the upper front deck, I looked out to the Portside of the ferry and had to steady myself, as I saw a massive glowing white ball which appeared to be so close to us I could have jumped off and floated right to it.

It took me a few moments to realise it. I was staring at our Moon. I was dumbstruck, it was so close! Right there! I turned back around, gazing out over the Starboard side, and I noticed that Earth was directly in my line of sight now. I turned back around, there was the moon to my left. Looking back again, there‚Äôs Earth off to my right. Something happened to me in that moment. This was entirely wrong. My mind, it simply could not compute the orientation. The moon should be above me. Earth should be below my feet. It also dawned on me in that moment, I was seeing Earth to my right, where it was below me earlier. We must have been slowly spinning around as we drifted through the Galaxy. Again, I couldn‚Äôt mentally process this. I began to feel incredibly dizzy, and I fell to the ground, unable to pick myself back up. I had to crawl my way back inside, sliding open the door and dragging myself to one of the only remaining empty rows of seats that were not yet occupied by the nothing-people.

Sitting back in my seat now, I just looked out the window, watching the celestial light show outside. If I wasn‚Äôt already, I was pretty dam sure now that I was not getting off this boat‚Ä¶ ever. I felt a sense of peace in that moment, like I didn‚Äôt have try so hard anymore. There was a feeling of acceptance, followed by a mix of sadness and regret. I thought back to that night. What if I had just taken a cab instead? It was midnight, what on earth was I even thinking taking a ferry back home at that hour anyway? Money, of course. It was always about money. Not in this moment it wasn‚Äôt. All of that seemed quite unimportant now. I just‚Ä¶ watched. As literal space and time passed by before my very eyes. Before long, my eyes became heavy, and I could keep them open no longer‚Ä¶



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



*‚ÄúAttention passengers! The caf√© service is now open! Please form a line, do not rush, do not push. Everybody will be served in due time.‚Äù*

The announcement from the P.A. system ripped me out of my slumber, signalling the return of my one and only friendly companion. I watched as the masses of nothing-people and strange humanoids began their march toward the caf√©. The ferry was almost full now, and there was a constant stream of them shuffling and stuttering their way up the stairs and towards the counter. One by one they placed their orders, collecting cups of coffee, hot pies, fresh sandwiches and slices of cake, before slowly making their way back down and filling up the empty seats once again.

I decided to wait until things calmed down a bit. I didn‚Äôt want to go anywhere near these things. The tall, pointy limbed ones which had boarded the ferry in the mangrove swamp yesterday were now clicking their way up the stairs, and I cringed back a little as they emerged at the top, their faces coming into view for the first time. They were downright horrible. Long, puffy faces that seemed permanently crafted into vicious looks of sheer hatred. I looked away, resigning myself to just waiting until I heard the crowds disperse. I could hear Caf√© Guy struggling to keep up with all this, yet his overtly positive attitude never once faltered. He still hummed Kumbaya as he went about his duties, and I now smiled at the sound of that tune, where it once kinda weirded me out. If he could keep his spirits up, maybe I could too.

I sat back, waiting my turn. Slowly but surely, in amongst noises I cannot even accurately put into words, I heard the crowd beginning to thin, and I chanced a look back in the direction of the caf√©. There were only about five or six passengers now, waiting in line to be served. At the front of the line stood a short little thing, no taller than a child of maybe five years old. His form was scrawny, save for his gigantic head, and I wondered how he actually stayed upright. It looked as though he should be toppling over every step. While this thing resembled a child in stature, it clearly was not. His face resembled something more akin to a 60 year old man, a thick, gruff beard, and wrinkled skin. I watched as he raised his arms, jumping up and down at the counter like a toddler would, before one of the taller passengers behind him reached down and picked him up, sitting him on the counter top.

I had to blink a couple of times to make sure what I was seeing was actually happening. It didn‚Äôt matter how much I had been exposed to, the sheer absurdity of this ferry still managed to catch me off guard. I watched on as he placed his order, in a language I could not fathom, before sliding off the top of the counter and landing back on the floor with a thud. He caught sight of me staring as he spun back around to await his order, and as he did so, a frown emerged across his face. A second later, he took a step forward, raised his hand‚Ä¶ and flipped me off.

Are you kidding me?! I thought to myself, as he turned back around and stared up at Caf√© Guy, tapping his foot as if growing impatient. Caf√© Guy noticed this, and he stepped away from the coffee machine for a moment. What happened next was rather chilling. I did not hear what was said between these two, but what I observed was enough. Caf√© Guy slowly stepped out from behind the counter, kneeled down to get face to face with this little guy, and whispered in his ear. As he communicated whatever it was, the little guy‚Äôs face grew more and more sombre, as though realising he had made a terrible mistake. Just before he stood up, Caf√© Guy pointed toward the Captain‚Äôs Quarters, before whispering a few more words of caution to the little fella. And that was it. Caf√© Guy stood up once again. The little guy stood off to the side, his hands now tucked behind his back, waiting patiently and quietly for his order. Once his order was prepared, he grabbed it from Caf√© Guy, turned around and looked at me sheepishly, gave a little wave as if to say ‚Äúsorry about before‚Äù, and then waddled off downstairs.

I could only stare after him, left to wonder what Caf√© Guy had told him. Although, it wasn‚Äôt hard to piece together the gist of it. Whatever that thing is that had stepped out from the Captain‚Äôs Quarters the other night is not something I‚Äôd like to be drawing the attention of. Pushing those thoughts to one side, and noticing that the remainder of the customers had received their orders and were now making their way back to their seats, I got up and made my way over, feeling hungry for a bite to eat, but also to pick this guy‚Äôs brain a little more.

*‚ÄúGood morning my friend!‚Äù* Said Caf√© Guy as I approached the counter. I gave him a little wave and returned his greeting, before stepping up to lean on the counter.

*‚ÄúI guess there‚Äôs no point in asking you where we are? Or how we‚Äôre here?‚Äù* I asked Caf√© Guy, assuming he was going to simply dance around the point once again. But then, what he said actually surprised me!

*‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on our final run! We‚Äôll be home soon! You can relax now, the journey is almost over,‚Äù* he said, and something in his happy, optimistic tone had me almost believing those words. Deep in the back of my mind, I knew that wasn‚Äôt true, but hope is a strange thing, it just takes the tiniest spark to keep you believing, to keep you holding on.

*‚ÄúWell, whatever that means, I guess I won‚Äôt be seeing you any more after, well, whatever comes next?‚Äù* I asked him, as he stood there smiling.

*‚ÄúOh I‚Äôll be around young man. I‚Äôve worked this route for many, many years, and I‚Äôll be doing this for many more to come. Like I always say, important to know one‚Äôs place,‚Äù* he said, his smile wavering ever so slightly.

I stared back at him, a look on my face struggling to mask the millions of questions I still wanted to ask, yet knew to be pointless. I got the feeling that no matter what I said, how I phrased it, or how desperately I begged him for answers, he wasn‚Äôt going to give me any. Whether by choice, or perhaps he genuinely did not know, I‚Äôm still not sure. Anyway, satisfied that I had once again hit the threshold of what he was willing to offer, I turned my attention to my empty belly, asking him for a couple more of those sausage rolls that seemed a staple of his little cafeteria.

Caf√© Guy smiled warmly, turning around and pulling a selection of sausage rolls out of the freezer box, and throwing them into the microwave. *‚ÄúComing right up Sir,‚Äù* he said, before turning around to prepare me a coffee. What a great bloke, I thought. I never even had to ask him. What‚Äôs more, he seemed to show the same kindness and accomodation to all the critters on this vessel, regardless of size, shape, language or outward appearance. Caf√© Guy was a man of the people. Or, rather, of the nothing-people.

***Ding!***

Ah, my precious pastries were done. I grabbed them off Caf√© Guy with a smile and a thank you, along with my hot coffee for the day, and bid him farewell once again, returning to my seat to get my breakfast into me. Sitting in my row of seats up front, I munched away on my sausage rolls and sipped my coffee as I gazed out the window, the universe slowly passing us by. Regardless of how I got here or what came next, I was very aware that I was witnessing something that very few human beings would ever have the privilege to see. I watched as a meteorite, its tail burning so very brightly in the darkness, flew past in the distance, and I wondered how far away it really was. One Earth-length? Five Earth-lengths? That blew my mind just thinking about it. Peeking my head out the window a little and looking up, I saw a group of tiny planets, or perhaps moons, just suspended there, as if props being held up by string before a huge, black canvas dotted with sparkles and swirls.

As the ferry drifted through this sheer magic, I swear I could hear whispers, all around me. Not inside the ferry, no, emanating and echoing all throughout the Galaxy, it seemed. They were indistinguishable from one another, yet beautifully unique at the same time. As insane as that sounds, all I can say is that things seemed to work differently out there. The laws of our world, they did not apply anymore. For example, my mind would occasionally catch a stray thought reminding me that there was no up or down out here, and I would suddenly feel weightless. I would have to lay down every time it happened, stretching out across my row of seats. Still when I think about it, I get that same feeling of vertigo. In that moment, however, before everything that happened next, I can honestly say it is the most alive I have ever felt. I continued watching the stars, distant planets and all manner of cosmic happenings for hours on end as the ferry continued gently floating along. Eventually, I do not know when, it could have been minutes, or it could have been hours, my eyes began to close, and I felt a sense of peace unlike any I have ever felt before, and likely ever will again. With an overwhelming feeling of warmth washing over my entire being, I was pulled into a blissful slumber once more‚Ä¶



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Jesus‚Ä¶ I thought I was done hearing that God awful noise. I took a peak at my watch, noting the time was around 10pm at night. Gosh, I had slept for a good while. Sitting up from my little row of seats and stretching, I took another look out the window, noticing we had drifted our way into a very different looking sector of the Galaxy. I say Galaxy, as this is my best estimate. I had no idea if we were even still in the Milky Way, or if we had drifted far beyond the outer rim. What I saw outside at that point, in comparison to where we had just come from, the best word I can use is ‚Äúdesolate‚Äù. This part of space was quite empty, and the colours were very different. Where before I could see all manner of bright colours and shades, now there appeared to be a dull, blue haze encompassing the area, and it was sparsely populated with small, grey looking planets and moons. The ferry began to shake and vibrate, as we made a slow approach toward one of these planets.

I noticed how strange and different this felt. The ferry didn‚Äôt even turn or readjust itself in any way, it just started drifting diagonally, shaking more violently the closer it got, as if caught in some kind of gravitational pull. As we got closer to the planet, I watched as Ramp Guy stomped his way around the deck, grabbing the ramp and throwing it toward the gate in preparation. Slowly we were pulled nearer to this strange place, which now looked more like a small moon than a planet, its surface rocky and smooth. Before long, a loud clunk, and the ferry groaned as it positioned itself up against a very strange looking ‚Äújetty‚Äù. It looked to be crafted out of black obsidian, and it stretched out for kilometres on end. I noticed a few more odd figures making their way up the dock, preparing to board the ferry. Anything remotely humanoid was far gone by this point, these ones walked on all fours and moved in pairs. When they reached the top, Ramp Guy began shouting at them to hurry it along.

I averted my eyes as I heard them clomping their way up the stairs toward the upper floor, what passed for their hands and feet slopping along the floor before squirming their way into an empty row of seats a little way behind mine. The ferry was fast filling up now, with only four rows on my side still empty. We continued floating along, making stops at more of these galactic wastelands, picking up more of these beings along the way. At one of these stops, I kid you not, we docked in to collect a group of three tall figures that looked almost identical to the typical depiction of an alien that you see in movies and tv shows. Tall, slim, pale white and seemingly faceless. They gently swayed their way onto the ship, shuffling up the stairs and taking a seat directly behind me. I could see their forms, towering above me, out of the periphery of my vision. I could hear the strange noises they made as they sat there no doubt staring at me. Without another thought, I quickly stood up and practically ran out onto the deck.

I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore! These things were too close to me now, and I could feel the burn of a thousand eyes on me. For some reason, I was still quite the spectacle on this ferry. That moment, was perhaps the most critical decision I made throughout my entire time on board. For as I made my way around to the front of the deck, I noticed something up ahead. It was only quite small in the distance at that stage, but I had my inklings as to what I was looking at. Something up ahead was much darker than the rest of the void surrounding us. I was staring at something pure pitched black in colour, and circular in shape. I knew what it was deep down, I knew in my heart, that‚Äôs where we were headed.

I ran back inside the ferry, bursting through the door, every set of eyes in the room drawn immediately to me, but I did not care. I ran to the Captain‚Äôs Quarters and I pounded on the door.

***‚ÄúPLEASE!!!‚Äù*** I shouted, trying desperately to get his attention. I bashed on the door, over and over and over again, screaming at him to please listen to me.

***‚ÄúPLEASE!!! LET ME OFF THIS FERRY!!!‚Äù*** I shouted, slamming my fist against the glass so hard I thought it might break. This time, I did get the Captain‚Äôs attention. Slowly, ever so slowly, he turned around to face me, without ever taking his hands off the wheel. He stared at me for moments on end, his face a blank slate, totally emotionless. I saw in that moment that it was pointless. The way this man looked at me, a look of complete and utter indifference toward me, as though I was merely cattle being herded toward the slaughter, was absolutely soul crushing.

I gently tapped my fist against the glass once more, my head now resting down beside my hand against the glass, and I sobbed. I sobbed because I knew it was over. I sobbed as I faced the prospect of half a life cut meaninglessly short. I sobbed as I looked up again, noticing the black spot on the horizon ahead growing larger still. I sobbed as I turned around, my back resting against the door as I slid down to the floor. And I sobbed harder still, as I looked up to see Caf√© Guy standing there, his eyes wet with tears the same as mine. Forcing myself up, I approached his counter for what I was sure would be the last time.

*‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù* Was all I could ask. Caf√© Guy just shook his head in response, wiping some tears away as he did so.

*‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt be possible,‚Äù* he said between sobs. *‚ÄúI knew there was something different about you the day I first saw you. Your eyes too vibrant, your spirit, too lively. You were not ready for this journey.‚Äù*

I stared back at him, things beginning to slowly fall into place. Tears welled up in my eyes as I spoke again, gently now, any remnants of hope long gone.¬†

*‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I still don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù* I said. *‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not possible, then how can it be? Why me?‚Äù* I asked, tears pouring from my eyes.

Caf√© Guy looked at me solemnly, a deep and genuine sadness present on his once kind face. Wiping away his own tears again, he spoke softly to me.

‚Äú*There are very few hard and fast rules at play in this universe. Certainly, fewer than we would like to believe. Sure, we have built ourselves a comfortable little modern society, under the false pretence that we are ever truly in control of any of it, overly confident in the knowledge that nothing which exists outside of our realms of understanding can ever harm us. It shouldn‚Äôt have been possible, young man. But you boarded the wrong ferry at the wrong time‚Ä¶ Now, there‚Äôs nothing any of us can do about it but continue on to our final destination‚Ä¶‚Äù*

I stood there in shock, not wanting to believe the words I was hearing, yet knowing full well within my heart that it was true. Caf√© Guy placed a gentle hand on my shoulder.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm so‚Ä¶ so sorry sir‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Defeated, I once again walked out on deck. I just paced around out there, not knowing what I could even do next, resigning myself to just making the most of the moments I had left. Around and around I strolled, looking out into the vacuum which enveloped us. Occasionally, I would look out ahead at the ever expanding size of the monster we were approaching. I had heard talk of black holes in my life, but I never really understood the many theories surrounding them. I wondered what we might face on the other side. Would we freeze, or perhaps burn to death? A little of both? Would we be transported to some incredible afterlife? Or perhaps the opposite? Or would it all turn black as midnight, our shared existence blinking out in an instant?

Hang on a second, I thought‚Ä¶ *‚Äúmidnight‚Äù*‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúYou boarded the wrong ferry at the wrong time‚Ä¶‚Äù*

What ran through my mind in that instant was perhaps extreme, yet is not hope so often a mere grain, worth taking a leap of faith for? My heart began to race, those primal instincts telling me to turn and run, or stand and fight, kicking in once again. I glanced at my watch‚Ä¶¬†

*11:45pm.*

It would need to be timed perfectly, I thought, as I ran back inside and took a seat in my now one empty row, ever other seat on the vessel now occupied by nothing-people and shadowy, alien lifeforms. I sat on the edge of my seat, my leg bouncing nervously up and down, as I glanced back and forth between the stairwell and my watch. As I sat there, waiting for my one moment of hope to approach, I heard the crackle of the P.A. system spark back to life.

*‚ÄúAttention passengers. The final caf√© service is now open. Last meal requests shall now be taken. Please form an orderly line and requests shall be catered to to the best of our ability.‚Äù*

Hearing those words‚Ä¶ ‚Äúlast meal‚Äù‚Ä¶ was harrowing. But I steeled myself, intent to remain focussed at all costs, no matter what else might happen around me. I glanced back at my watch. The minutes were ticking by so very slowly now. I only prayed this thing was still in sync, or that time was even relevant out here. I did not know‚Ä¶ What I did know is that it was a chance. And that was the best I could hope for.

The herd of nothing-people were all making their way up to the counter, what seemed like hundreds of them now, blocking the stairwell. I watched in amazement as Caf√© Guy churned out beautiful meals, seemingly from nowhere. Everything from fine Italian cuisine, to hearty noodle dishes, as well as odd looking slops, grains and other dishes that were not even remotely comprehensible to my human mind. Before long the line had moved up and around the aisles enough that I had some space to slip down the stairs. Before I did so I quickly made my way over to the side of the counter, placing a hand on Caf√© Guy‚Äôs shoulder. He looked over to me, puzzled.

*‚ÄúThank you. For everything.‚Äù* I said to him, before darting off down the stairs. There was a look in his eyes as I left him there. He looked concerned, like he knew what I had planned, and was just as unsure as me as to whether or not it might work.

Stepping down out of the stairwell, I grabbed myself a seat right on the edge of one of the centre rows, with a straight shot to the Portside exit. I sat there, nervously bouncing my leg up and down again, my adrenaline starting to kick in. I glanced at my watch‚Ä¶

*11:57pm.*¬†

This is it, I thought, as I glanced back up to look at the doorway‚Ä¶ and I froze. Ramp Guy, with his massive form and his hate filled glare, was standing right there, staring at me. Oh my God. Did he know? I stood up from my seat, pacing back and forth up and down the aisles, pretending to be simply stretching my legs. Every time I turned around to pace back down the aisle, I saw him, still standing there blocking the doorway. I looked back at my watch‚Ä¶¬†

*11:58pm.*

I spun around, walking back up the stairwell now. I could practically feel the ticking of my watch, every precious second not one that I could afford to waste. Reaching the top step I turned the corner, heading toward the Portside deck on the upper floor. On my way past, I caught sight once more of Caf√© Guy. I think he knew now, and he gave me a warm smile and a nod as I passed him by. I slid open the doorway, stepping out onto the upper deck, and leaning over the railing. Ramp Guy was still there, standing in the doorway downstairs.

*11:59pm‚Ä¶*

It was now or never. I stepped up onto the railing of the upper deck, and I jumped!

***CLANG!***

I landed gut first on the lower deck, completely disoriented with the ferry‚Äôs weird movements through space. This did not go unnoticed by Ramp Guy, nor did my almost perfectly executed series of movements following it, as I threw myself back onto my feet and ripped open the ferry‚Äôs Portside gates. I stood there, teetering on the edge, staring down into the void, as Ramp Guy began moving toward me.

*30 seconds to go‚Ä¶*

I gripped onto the railing so hard it hurt my hands, as I shuffled my feet along the narrow, slippery ledge on the outside of the vessel. Clinging to the ferry, I took a few measured steps along the outside, trying to make it as difficult as possible for this prick to grab me.

*15 seconds to go‚Ä¶*

*10 seconds to go‚Ä¶*

I counted them down in my head now, as I desperately tried to cling on to the railing until the last possible second.

*10‚Ä¶ 9‚Ä¶ 8‚Ä¶*

Ramp Guy was right there in front of me now!

*7‚Ä¶ 6‚Ä¶ 5‚Ä¶*

*‚ÄúWhere do ya think you‚Äôre goin‚Äô aye?!‚Äù* He grunted, as he gripped my arms tight.

*4‚Ä¶ 3‚Ä¶ 2‚Ä¶ 1‚Ä¶*

I pushed off as hard as I could, launching myself willingly into the abyss! Ramp Guy, however, did not let go. So determined to keep me on board that hellish vessel he was, that he was now plummeting through space right along with me! As we fell, the cold solar winds whipping by us as we went, I cried out in pain as he wrapped a massive arm around my neck, seemingly intent on at least killing me if he could not keep me prisoner.

Down and down we fell, Ramp Guy squeezing the life out of me harder and harder all the while. I could feel myself slipping away into darkness, and for a few awful moments I was all but certain that after everything this was going to be how it ended for me, when suddenly, a familiar crash of thunder!

***SPLASH!***

I was under water again. Where? I did not know. I tried desperately to kick my legs and get myself back to the surface, but I could not move. I opened up my eyes, and in one horrifying moment I saw why. A long dead, rotting corpse was clung to my body. I screamed, bubbles escaping my mouth as I manically tried to get this thing off me! Finally, after much thrashing and kicking, I was free, and I kicked my legs and flailed my arms as hard as I could, making my way up toward the sliver of moonlight I could see above.

With a crash, I broke through the surface, desperately taking in air as I looked around, trying to figure out where the hell I had ended up this time. And then I saw it. It took a few moments to take it all in, admittedly. The familiar cityscape beyond the harbour lights. The iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House, still standing firm and in tact. Luna Park‚Ä¶ bright and bubbly just as it had always been. I was back in Sydney. The real Sydney!

*‚ÄúOi! Get outa' the water dickhead! There‚Äôs sharks in there!‚Äù*

As if to confirm what I was seeing in possibly the most Aussie way possible, a shout from the shoreline, from a real human being! I never thought in a million years I would be so glad to be bobbing up and down in the middle of Sydney Harbour at midnight.

The man did raise a good point though, and I began quickly making a bee line for the rocky edges of the harbour nearby. One stroke‚Ä¶ then another‚Ä¶ then another. All the while, very concious that a bull shark may see fit to take a chunk out of me as I swam along. But I kept going, knowing that freedom was just metres away now.

The feeling of grabbing onto those rocks, and dragging myself up onto the grass, is the best sensation I have ever experienced in my life. I remember the blades of grass digging into my skin as I stared up at the starry, moonlit sky with a newfound sense of dread, and I recall how overwhelmingly grateful I was for merely being able to feel something as mundane as grass. I was back‚Ä¶ I was home‚Ä¶

I did not even consider getting on another ferry. Or a bus, or a train. Too paranoid that something may spirit me away to another realm. I walked myself up the hill, found the nearest road, and called myself an Uber like I dam well should have done in the first place. A little over an hour later, and finally, I was stepping in through my front door for the first time in what had genuinely felt like months, but in reality, had been merely a few days.

There has been much I have reflected on in the days since I returned. Not least of all Caf√© Guy‚Äôs words. There are indeed, very few rules keeping this existence of our‚Äôs bound to normality. Fewer than any of us would be comfortable being truly aware of. I am no stranger to this corner of the internet. That which houses endless Creepypasta tales and reality bending horror stories. So the next time you‚Äôre reading one of these submissions, perhaps something about a cursed bus, or a haunted tram ride. Consider for a moment, how farfetched are these stories really? It has been long theorised among those familiar with the paranormal that there are certain times of day which align with things we simply do not understand. And there are of course, places in this world where strange things are simply more prone to occur.

Maybe you‚Äôll remember my tale the next time you‚Äôre waiting in line for the bus or the train‚Ä¶ or the ferry. Perhaps the stop you‚Äôre waiting at feels a little off. A little too liminal, almost like a place between places. Maybe you notice something that doesn‚Äôt quite fit, like an out of place fog. Maybe in those moments, it‚Äôs best to just call yourself a cab. I don‚Äôt know. All I know is that what I experienced on board was definitely not of this world. It terrifies me to think what might have happened if I had remained on board, if I had not chanced that leap of faith at the exact moment I did.

1idfdch,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1idfdch/im_not_bad_at_dating_just_most_dating_apps/,"I‚Äôm not bad at dating, just most dating apps.","So I‚Äôve been seeing this girl on at least 3 dates now and on date 1 she got very attracted to me during our conversation to the point where at the end she pulled me to the side of the restaurant and kissed me for my first kiss. On date 2 we had some ‚Äúintimate‚Äù time in my car which was my first time trying things with a woman (not the big S-E-X yet). It was a little awkward in that it‚Äôs definitely different and much harder than by yourself. Performance anxiety and premature ‚Äúexcitement‚Äù are a pain in the butt. But she wanted to see me a third time to do more. Still struggled with those issues but despite our sexy time plans being a little rough we actually had a lot of great intimate moments. She‚Äôs into some wild things which necessitates direct communication which is great for someone on the spectrum like myself. I can ask or say most things and feel free and safe around her to say them or be told if I crossed a line in a calm way. We have a fourth date scheduled tomorrow. We‚Äôre gonna take things a little slower and stick with at home movies, food, and cuddles.

What I learned from finding a girl so far, that I wish I was taught, was the following. Guys should pick the date place, time, and pay for both of you. If the girl offers you can do a brief polite dance where you say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs ok I got it‚Äù or something like that and if she insists then let her split it or pay. Most girls I got dates with were fine with fast food or a decent affordable fast casual restaurant or coffee. If you both voice that it‚Äôs going well plan the next date (skeleton plan of place and time) at the end of the date or text shortly after planning it. Timelines for sex, seeing eachother‚Äôs family, houses, first kiss, vary depending on the woman. The previous woman I went on two dates with, then I politely told her I didn‚Äôt feel a romantic spark. Avoid sex stuff in messages, unless the woman initiates or it‚Äôs been a few dates. Tread carefully even then. Reserve compliments of physical beauty for the first date. Compliment a choice she made like her outfit or necklace. Say stuff like ‚Äúyou make that look great‚Äù instead of ‚Äúthat looks great.‚Äù

The app I used was Hinge. The part that made hinge work most for me was being able to send a message with my likes. I was told my profile photos aren‚Äôt the best but I found a winning message that gives me the best odds of being liked back. That message is ‚Äúare you looking to get married at some point?‚Äù DO NOT USE THIS AND LIE!!! I do intend to find a wife, and see the dating process as is trying eachother out for marriage. I‚Äôm 25 and graduated college so women around my age are starting to become maternal and want a family. I want a family too and to have many kids. Try to get their phone number after about a day of messaging in a subtle way like ‚ÄúI want to show you this picture of this cool thing I talked about but I‚Äôm not sure how?‚Äù And hopefully she suggests her number or social. Worst case scenario it‚Äôs fine to ask. My current date wanted to wait until our first date before exchanging numbers. Keep the conversation going each day until your date but don‚Äôt worry if it takes them a few hours to respond. The real make it or break it moment is the first date. I‚Äôve actually found some women to be prettier in person who‚Äôve taken bad photos. 

The rules about chivalry absolutely still apply. Be polite and gentlemanly but also match the energy of the girl if she‚Äôs getting hot and bothered in a good way. Allow yourself to feel proud of your accomplishments and special interests. women like to hear a guy talk about something he‚Äôs knowledgeable on even if they don‚Äôt understand it and on dates that‚Äôs happened most times for me. Don‚Äôt be afraid to politely disagree with her on some things. Women don‚Äôt want a doormat but they also don‚Äôt want an abuser. They want someone who respects them enough to say what they think around them. 

Some people say no politics on the first date but that depends if the app tells you their politics or not or if you already know. I like to get into values a little bit right away like number of kids, spirituality, while saving hot button stuff for a little later unless you know their politics or she brings it up.

Hope those tips are concrete and help. Obviously it‚Äôs not comprehensive, and everyone is different blah blah, but I wish I was told a lot of it and wasn‚Äôt. I had to read about it. This is a lot of stuff aspies miss. Also work on your appearance I.e lose weight, workout, learn fashion, photography, and style your hair and beard.

1idfaqe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1idfaqe,A newbie review: AJ Fernandez Last Call,"First off, this will be my first review ever. I will try to explain everything as best as possible for a new guy to the cigar community. 

First off I feel like the cigar is packed very well. At least this individual one that I have it doesn‚Äôt feel loose at all. It feels nice to hold in the hand. I also love that the foot of the wrapper is closed. It actually allowed me to get a very good taste of the wrapper off the first light.

The wrapper itself has smells of sweet tobacco, and I personally get a small hint of some type of fruit maybe a black cherry. 

The first light flavor gave me a hints of cedar and pepper. It tasted very earthy as well. As I‚Äôve gotten deeper into this cigar,it has left notes of bitterness reminiscent to coffee on my pallet in between puffs. Every time I puff on it, I get hints of dark chocolate, cedar, earthy notes, and of course the sweetness of the tobacco. On the retrohale, I get very strong pepper and spice notes, which may be enjoyable to some. 

The inhale quality itself is very smooth. It produces a very nice, thick white smoke and smells of tobacco. The ash is also a very nice white color. 

This may have not been a pro review, but I tried my best as a first time reviewer. It took me about 30 minutes to get through the cigar.

Price point was right at $7.50 usd. 

My personal rating was would be 4.5/5 stars. It overall was a very enjoyable cigar and I hope to find even better ones in the future. Thanks for reading! This was only my second ever cigar that I‚Äôve actually sat down to enjoy! ",4,1738214066.0,cigar,2,1.0,False

I got up and instantly felt the craziest sensation go upwards of my back. Heading towards the top of my head. It had felt like I‚Äôd had 10 shots of coffee, with my body vibrating in a sense and extremely hyper focused. I felt so focused, aware of everything around me. I‚Äôd never felt this feeling before, never felt this extreme amount of awareness and energetic sensation. I also felt very sure of myself, like every decision I made was the right one.   

I closed my eyes again, figuring it would help me see what this is. That‚Äôs when I felt slithering sensation go upwards of my back, to the top of my head. I felt as if my body was slithering back and forth constantly. 

I‚Äôm writing this because I‚Äôd like to understand what this is? I‚Äôve read a little on kundalini but don‚Äôt want to make assumptions. Also would like to know what do I do now? Obviously keep meditating but is their anything more I can do?

1idf9nc,https://i.redd.it/8x0g4jlje2ge1.gif,"Thursday, January 30, 2025 | Word of The Day ""Mindset"" - The Power of Daily Choices: Crafting a Mindset of Empowerment ‚Ä¢ [Click to Expand]","## Rise and Choose: How Morning Thoughts Shape Our Lives



Every morning, like clockwork, the world stirs us awake. Whether it‚Äôs the blaring alarm, a soft ray of sunlight, or the gentle nudge of a pet looking for breakfast, we‚Äôre faced with the same quiet invitation: How will we shape our day? It might seem trivial at first glance, but the truth is, every day begins with a choice that ripples through every interaction, challenge, and thought that follows. Will we fill our minds with empowering, uplifting ideas, or will we allow negativity to settle in and dictate our mood and actions?  

This might sound philosophical, but it‚Äôs also deeply practical. We‚Äôre the gatekeepers of our minds, and how we start each day can set the tone for everything that follows. Let‚Äôs explore why this choice is so crucial and how we can lean into empowerment rather than being bogged down by negativity.  

### The Weight of Our Thoughts  

Imagine you wake up feeling groggy. You glance at your phone and see a work email waiting for your response‚Äîa problem to fix, a deadline creeping closer. Maybe you scroll through social media and see someone‚Äôs seemingly perfect life or an article filled with bad news. Without realizing it, your mind begins to spiral. You‚Äôre already weighed down before you‚Äôve even had your first sip of coffee.  

I‚Äôve been there. There was a time when my mornings felt like an unrelenting sprint. I‚Äôd wake up and immediately dive into everything I hadn‚Äôt done, everything I feared might go wrong, and everything I thought I lacked. My mind became a breeding ground for negativity, and my day would mirror that chaos.  

But then, I tried an experiment. Instead of checking my phone first thing in the morning, I started writing down three things I was grateful for. They weren‚Äôt grand things, just simple ones: the warmth of my bed, the quiet of the early hours, or the smell of coffee brewing. This small practice shifted my mindset. It taught me that my thoughts‚Äîthose first fragile moments of the day‚Äîcould either anchor me in possibility or drag me into worry.  

### The Science Behind Empowerment  

There‚Äôs a psychological basis for why our thoughts matter so much. Psychologists often talk about the concept of *neuroplasticity*, which is the brain‚Äôs ability to adapt and rewire itself based on our thoughts and behaviors. When we consistently focus on empowering ideas‚Äîlike gratitude, goals, or solutions‚Äîwe‚Äôre training our brain to recognize and seek positivity. Over time, this becomes a habit, a lens through which we view the world.  

On the flip side, if we indulge in negative thinking, our brain becomes wired to expect and amplify negativity. It‚Äôs like walking through a forest: the more you tread one path, the more defined it becomes. Eventually, it‚Äôs the easiest route to take.  

But here‚Äôs the empowering part: every day gives us the chance to choose which path we‚Äôll tread. And while it‚Äôs not always easy to steer away from negativity, especially during tough times, it‚Äôs always possible.  

### Strategies to Fill Your Mind with Empowering Thoughts  

So, how do we consciously choose empowerment every day? Here are a few strategies that have worked for me and others:  

#### 1. **Start with Gratitude**  
As I mentioned earlier, gratitude is a game-changer. It‚Äôs hard to feel negative when you‚Äôre actively appreciating what‚Äôs good in your life. Whether it‚Äôs jotting down three things you‚Äôre grateful for or simply saying them out loud, this practice can reframe your mindset almost instantly.  

#### 2. **Limit Negative Inputs**  
What we consume influences how we think. If your morning starts with doom-scrolling or absorbing stressful news, it‚Äôs no surprise that negativity follows. Try replacing those habits with something uplifting, like a podcast, a meditation session, or even a favorite song that makes you feel good.  

#### 3. **Visualize Success**  
Take a few moments each morning to visualize your day going well. Picture yourself handling challenges with ease, achieving your goals, and feeling good about your progress. This practice not only boosts confidence but also primes your brain to recognize opportunities for success.  

#### 4. **Talk to Yourself Like a Friend**  
Have you ever noticed how we often talk to ourselves in ways we‚Äôd never talk to a friend? We‚Äôre quick to criticize and slow to encourage. Changing this inner dialogue is key. When self-doubt creeps in, counter it with empowering statements. Remind yourself of your strengths, your resilience, and your past successes.  

#### 5. **Surround Yourself with Positivity**  
The people and environments we surround ourselves with play a huge role in shaping our mindset. Spend time with individuals who uplift and inspire you. Create a physical space that feels calm and motivating. Even small changes, like adding a motivational quote to your desk, can make a difference.  

### When Negativity Tries to Sneak In  

Let‚Äôs be real: even with the best intentions, negativity can sneak in. Life is unpredictable, and tough moments are inevitable. The key isn‚Äôt to avoid negative thoughts altogether‚Äîthat‚Äôs impossible‚Äîbut to recognize them and choose not to dwell on them.  

Here‚Äôs an analogy I love: thoughts are like clouds. They drift into your mind, but you don‚Äôt have to let them linger. If a negative thought arises, acknowledge it, and then let it pass. Focus instead on what you can control or improve.  

For example, I once had a big project at work that wasn‚Äôt going well. My initial reaction was to spiral into self-doubt: *What if I mess this up? What if I‚Äôm not good enough?* But instead of staying in that place, I paused and reframed the situation. I asked myself, *What‚Äôs one small step I can take to move forward?* That shift‚Äîfrom dwelling to doing‚Äîmade all the difference.  

### The Ripple Effect of Empowerment  

What‚Äôs truly amazing about choosing empowering thoughts is how it doesn‚Äôt just affect you‚Äîit influences everyone around you. When you approach life with positivity and intention, it shows in your actions, your words, and your energy. You become a source of light for others, inspiring them to do the same.  

Think about it: when was the last time someone‚Äôs kindness or optimism brightened your day? That‚Äôs the ripple effect of empowerment. By choosing to start each day with positive intent, you‚Äôre not just shaping your own life; you‚Äôre contributing to a more hopeful, compassionate world.  

### Closing Thoughts  

Every day, we‚Äôre presented with countless choices. Some are big, like deciding on a career move or a major purchase. But it‚Äôs the smaller, quieter choices‚Äîlike how we think when we wake up‚Äîthat often have the greatest impact.  

So tomorrow morning, when the world stirs you awake, take a moment. Breathe deeply. Before the rush of the day begins, remind yourself: *I have the power to choose.* Choose thoughts that empower you. Choose gratitude, kindness, and hope. And watch how those choices shape not just your day, but your entire life.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ Jon was wrong.¬† He made a mistake.¬† He‚Äôs a new driver ‚Äì but I won‚Äôt excuse it.¬† The other driver was aggrieved, his property was damaged and his property is dear ‚Äì I get it.¬† What I‚Äôm saying is that he had a right to his anger, but there‚Äôs a limit, where the contract of sharing the road is implied.¬† There‚Äôs always a risk that someone will make a mistake.¬†

When I got out of my car and approached the man, it didn‚Äôt go well.¬† He was actually upset that I checked Jon first; that I assured that he was okay.¬† ‚ÄúForget about him,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlook at my fucking car!‚Äù

I already knew that he had been yelling at my Jon, and I wasn't alright with that.  Now he was yelling at me.¬† The fuse was lit either way.

I inspected the damage to his car, which wasn‚Äôt substantial, but clearly more than nothing.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very sorry this happened, and you can rest assured that we‚Äôll make it right.‚Äù¬† Then I turned to Jon and asked if he called the police, which I asked him to do when he first called.¬† He said he hadn‚Äôt.¬† The man asked him not to.

I pulled my phone from my pocket, ‚ÄúWe need a report.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a report; I don‚Äôt want this going on my record.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going on his,‚Äù I said, motioning to Jon, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll only be named.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy rates will go up!‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt necessarily wrong and I understood his frustration.¬† Insurance companies jack rates for just being in the wrong place, so I sympathized.¬† ‚ÄúI hope that doesn‚Äôt happen.¬† But we‚Äôre still getting a report.‚Äù

I dialed Joe the cop directly (it‚Äôs a small town).¬†

The familiarity with which I spoke on the phone was alarming to the man, and I understood that too.¬†

‚ÄúWhat, now you‚Äôre buddy-buddy with your hick police department?‚Äù

I held my phone away, but didn‚Äôt cover it ‚Äì I wanted Joe to hear.¬† ‚ÄúMy son was clearly wrong, and that‚Äôs what the police will find.‚Äù I said.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm completely covered, and we‚Äôll make it right.¬† You need to relax.‚Äù

And this was where he crossed the line.

‚ÄúWhy is he even driving, a freak like him. ¬†He can‚Äôt even see over the fucking wheel.‚Äù

Yes, he actually said that.

Okay, see, the situation was suddenly more complicated now.¬† I‚Äôm a reasonable man.¬† But I‚Äôm also a father.¬† And even though I am a father once-removed in this case, Jon is never-the-less my son, for all it means.¬† The man said what he said to hurt him.¬† It does hurt him.¬† It is therefore perverse to expect that I won‚Äôt protect him.¬† My response was swift and spontaneous, if unexpected.¬† ‚ÄúOHH!‚Äù I shouted, as if I were Tony Soprano (I had never ‚ÄúOHH‚Äôd‚Äù before in my life; I don‚Äôt even know where it came from).¬† Instantly furious, I walked up on him like Tyson in a ring.¬† ‚ÄúNow you listen to me, you son-of-a-bitch‚Ä¶‚Äù¬† I don‚Äôt remember what I said after that.

Jon was begging me to stop, while at the same time, I could hear Joe on the phone, ‚ÄúMack, Mack, Mack!‚Äù¬† So I put the phone back to my ear.¬† ‚ÄúGet in your car and wait for me.‚Äù Joe said.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way.‚Äù

Still nose to nose with this man, I would say, ‚ÄúUse your lights, Joe, I‚Äôm about drop this bitch.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop talking, Mack ‚Äì not another word!¬† Get in your car.‚Äù¬†

So I did.  Well, I didn't actually get in my car, but I walked back to stand near it with Jon.

Maybe my reaction was wrong, and I think it was.¬† This isn‚Äôt my genre, I‚Äôm nobody‚Äôs tough-guy, and I shouldn‚Äôt have allowed this man‚Äôs obvious anger and insecurity to hobble my better judgment.¬† I stepped up on him in a way that left almost no escape.¬† But for Joe‚Äôs order, as a Neanderthal at my core, I‚Äôm not sure how it might have otherwise gone.¬† That‚Äôs not who I am.

It was not my finest moment, and frankly I‚Äôm ashamed.

It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm exhausted by a world that will freely attack a boy that I love dearly just because he‚Äôs different.¬† I can‚Äôt oblige it ‚Äì I never could, even at times when I‚Äôm better restrained.¬† It hurts him and so it hurts me and it‚Äôs enough, already.¬† A moment with our Jon and you‚Äôd understand.¬† He‚Äôs so gentle and kind.¬† And he‚Äôs forgiving, more than I.¬† ¬†¬†

Joe would arrive to process the scene and he did so without bias.¬† He‚Äôs a good man.¬† Though in his dealings with this schmuck at the scene, he too would find contempt, and he was certain to let it show.¬† He noted a couple of infractions; though he didn‚Äôt cite him (I‚Äôm not sure if he could in the moment).¬† ‚ÄúI really wish you had a warrant,‚Äù he mumbled before he would explain the report and the process to us both.

We‚Äôll fix his car; insurance will take on from here, and I‚Äôll advocate for the bridging of any shortcomings, even still.¬† It‚Äôs the right thing to do.¬† Jon feels horrible, and so do I.¬† Nobody meant any harm.

Once home, Jon would linger before coming inside.¬† By then, I was half through the process of brewing coffee (like I needed any) when he took a stool at the island.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Odie,‚Äù he said.

I walked over and briefly enveloped him, leaving a kiss on the side of his head before continuing on to the fridge.¬† I got him a root beer, twisting off the cap, as if his bartender, hearing his woes, as I set the bottle before him.¬† ‚ÄúYou know, Jack, I did the same thing when I was your age.‚Äù I told him.¬† I explained the moment, and how I was looking left when the car in front of me hesitated.¬† ‚ÄúOnly I had Pop in the car.‚Äù

He smiled.¬† ‚ÄúDid you hit an asshole like I did?‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, she was so hot.‚Äù I chuckled.¬† ‚ÄúLike a cheerleader ‚Äì 17 ‚Äì blonde, awwff.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you ask her out - what happened?‚Äù

I reminded him that I was dating Suzie then, and asked him what she might have thought about that. ¬†

Jon smiled.¬† ‚ÄúOh, yeah.‚Äù

I assured him that everything would be okay, explaining how it goes from here and how it‚Äôs in the hands of the insurance company now.¬† ‚ÄúIt happens every day, Jon, it‚Äôs alright,‚Äù I told him.¬†

‚ÄúSo they‚Äôll fix his car?‚Äù

I told them they would and not to worry. ¬†I told him that this was what he was paying insurance for.

In time, we‚Äôll need to revisit the matter when the policy is assessed, but not tonight.¬† His (my) rate will increase, and I think he needs to feel that.¬† Jon pays me for his insurance, but it‚Äôs a flat number, and it‚Äôs largely supplemented ‚Äì he has no idea.¬† I‚Äôm an advocate for presenting the real world to my sons, but I‚Äôm also merciful.¬† Still, it is altogether right that he is assessed for the increase, if for the sake of the real world alone.¬† But not tonight.¬†

He‚Äôs a pretty tough kid, and I know that a lot of this rolled of his back, so much more than mine.¬† And I think it‚Äôs important for me to remember that.

I think he likes me, but I am not in the same place. I obviously want to return his clothing item and tell him this face to face because I think he might want to go serious, but I have a few questions about how to do this‚Ä¶

He‚Äôs stopping into town for a few days before heading out on another trip. I want to do it before he leaves again, to get it over with as soon as possible. Do I start with the dumping right at the beginning of the date? I anticipate this lasting maybe 10 minutes, assuming he doesn‚Äôt want to talk extensively about it. Does anyone have advice for how to ease into it? Should it be the first thing I say? Or should build up to it? If so, what‚Äôs a way to bridge into that conversation?

I‚Äôve been on and off birth control (Yaz oral) for awhile. I was on it consistently for a few years and decided to wean off. Never had any real stomach problems until like a year ago when I started having to hack up mucus every so often. A doctor said it was GERD. That‚Äôs around the time when I started consistently being off birth control. But now after 7-8 months of being off birth control for good, my GERD has just gotten worse. Drinking coffee doesn‚Äôt help lol but I plan on stopping. It just seems like my esophagus/ stomach is sooo sensitive right now probably because its been inflamed for a long time. There was maybe about a few days where I didn‚Äôt hack up anything which was a few months ago. Since then that‚Äôs the only time that I haven‚Äôt had to hack up mucus. 
I have a little suspicion that it‚Äôs severity is dependent on where I am in my cycle. I used to have bad calf/varicose vein pain during ovulation or before my period and now the pain is completely gone. I‚Äôm hoping that these stomach/esophagus problems just naturally get better while including strict diet changes for at least a little bit of time to help myself heal. Currently my throat/stomach feels really uncomfortable. I‚Äôve been having stomach pain after eating towards the bottom of my abdomen.

He got out of a long term relationship RIGHT before we started dating. I trust him and I don‚Äôt doubt at all that he is over her. However, I understand that it was a very long and meaningful relationship and it takes time to heal from that. Before we started dating I asked him if he needed to speak with her again for closure, or about anything at all and he reassured me multiple times that no, he doesn‚Äôt. He doesn‚Äôt hate her or is angry, but he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with her and doesn‚Äôt need a conversation to feel at peace.

However, I have a very bad feeling about this and I have been very anxious since hearing about it. I am lost. Is it normal for me to feel so upset about it? I am conflicted with understanding her and yet being angry with her. It makes me sick to think about him having a deeply emotional conversation with her in person. He said he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to her and won‚Äôt, and I feel that I‚Äôd break up with him if he did want to because why would you need to work on a relationship that is DONE when you have a new girlfriend?

I have a dilemma. I love coffee and fresh roasted beans. A bought a Behmor 1600 (upgraded to plus) about 10 years ago. I've never really liked the Behmor because of the constant babysitting and button mashing just to keep it running through the full roast. I had plenty of time to spend on that until a few years ago when I started my own business and as such, I've been drinking the yuk from the store until I can get around to roasting but months go by and don't around to it because of the above mentioned.

What's the best roaster for around $500 that doesn't require all the babysitting, if one exists, yet yields great results? I'm always within visual of my roaster but I want to just set it and have as little interaction from me as possible so I can focus on my work and not have to stand at the machine ready to hit a button every 2 minutes after the initial timer. I like Ethiopian beans and they to take a lot longer to roast. On the Behmor, I run full heat, 1lb, for the full time, then drop the temp to half so they don't burn but have to keep it going for a lot longer requiring a button press every \~1.5 minutes several times before they're done and hope I don't miss the shut off timer.

1idenwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1idenwo/corporation_harrasing_me_the_franchise_store/,"corporation harrasing me the franchise store owner, what should I do? Can I even fight back?","Hello,

I own a small store in the midst of busy intersection, when family first bought the store (2 decades ago) I was the only store on the block, which did 1.2mill back then. Anyways, so I was put on this program in 2022 according to the corporation's contract which basically said if you gross less than a 1 mill in sales, we'll give you support money to stay afloat every month... During covid the sales dropped to like 800k, and since then we have been growing at a steady 12% in sales every year...

The only other way the corporation was able to take me out of the program legally was if I failed the cleaning inspections or if i recieved 2 breaches of their contract. (Keep in mind if you get 3 breaches, they make u sell the store in 90 days and if you don't find a buyer, they give you a payout of 25k. Which is ridiculous since my family bought the business for well over 250k....) 

Then the harrasing started late of last year before the financials for '24 came out....They were litterally out to get me. I go to all the other stores under same corporation frequently since those owners were my friends as well, my store isn't perfect but its in hell of a lot better shape than some of the other stores I've been to... 

So first they gave me a breach of contract for cleanliness....they said they saw dirt on the floors underneath the cooler doors. The customer's can't see it, I couldn't see it, you literally had to bend down under all the shelves and shine a flash light to see that, it was a coke can that exploded under the cooler shelves....Seemed a little odd when that happened, since I've seen far worse things and it doesn't harm anyone or any products. Anyways I went ahead and fixed that....This was just one of the incidients, there were a few more times. Then corporation was like these guys aren't going to pass an inspection we made it soo tough for anyone to pass, so they left us alone for a while. 

Then by god's grace, my worker caught the inspection lady doing some sketchy stuff and marking us down for something that we did correctly so she gave us those points and we passed the inspection. 

I swear to you, the next event blew my mind and confirmed my suspicions on the corporation out to get me........

Litterally the day we passed the inspection, I believe it was around december 21st or so, deadass I got a call the NEXT DAY, that the district manager of the corporation went to my store and saw something dirty and gave me another breach of contract......This means legally they can remove me from the program....Like we did what needed to be fixed, we did everything we could do. I went in everyday and worked towards these so called things I had to fix... If they already decided in their minds to remove us from the program then clearly there's nothing I could've done....

Like if I showed you the pictures they would document, you'd think they're crazy and clearly harrasing me. There was a picture of some dust underneath the shelves, there was another picture of a stain on the sidewalk outside, they made me go rent a powerwash and get it removed otherwise they'd fine me. They said there was weeds around my dumptster outside in the back....like whose that hurting??? They said I can't have stock on the flloor when I get my delivery......like its a small store I have no other place, and I only have 1 employee, he's doing the most he can while taking care of everything else....The corporation takes 50% of gross profit, I can't even afford to hire 2 employees at a time, its insane. Another one where it said I can't double bag the trash cans....(I do that so thrown cups with liquid wouldn't spill). My family had this store for around 20 years, and the amount of harrasment I am having to deal with is insane.

Out of anger I said maybe I'll just sell the store to get rid of your torture, when I'm maintaining standards, and passing your inspections but still getting harrassed by your corporate employees about non existent ""issues"".....Guess what he documented that as well and sent it to the higher officials, like oh he's thinking about selling store, we should just force him into it so then we can just take the store from them for cheap.....So now they're doing all they can to give me another breach, and I'm doing all I can to not get another breach...Idk when this war will end, just leave me alone and let me run my business....

The worst part is, the guy who comes from corporate whose giving me a hard time every week, I have to pay for part of his salary according to  the contract....Indirectly I'm litterally paying this guy to harrass me......smh

Anyways I honestly don't know what to do or when this will end. I'm honestly thinking of just giving up, and just getting rid of the store, I only kept it so I can pay for my sister's college and afford the house. I have a lot of loyal customers that have been coming to me for years. They come to my specific store even though there's a closer one to their house, because I always have the best service, cleanliness, best assortment, and fresh food that hasn't been rotting on the grills for hours.....Man the amount of false accusations corporate is making is insane, its pissing me off so much. The worst part is there's another store 30 seconds from my house, so I go there everyday to get coffee and check how they doing....They never have fresh food/pizza past lunch time.....And I get blasted from corporate of not having pizza in the non busy times...like bro wtff, why am I the one getting questioned every time. So I follow their rules, and waste so much food, that I pay for out of my pocket....it makes no sense, anyways if you guys have any ideas or suggestions I could do, it'd be really helpful.

I was worried thr tooth pain was from a failed root canal 6 months prior. I was partially right..they missed a 4th canal and retreated. They **Also gave me antibiotics** to take. I took the z pack. 

So I'm still feeling unwell for a few weeks so I see an ENT... He said my sinuses look okay...**i say no when he offers to check my throat** and sends me away with **more antibiotics**.... I take them.

My stomach starts burning randomly. My jaw starts hurting more than ever. I develop a persistent cough for 5 or 6 weeks. I have no clue the cough is from the acid reflux. I do realize the antibiotics probably ruined my gut bacteria. **I make zero connection how much it can worsen my preexisting tmjd symptoms I had prior to the root canals and reflux.**

I tell my primary physical about my stomach. She said to try some drug for a while from the pharmacy that requires no prescription. I ignore her. I figure it will all work itself out eventually if I eat gut healthy foods. My cough goes away, but my headaches get worse. My teeth hurt when I swallow. My throat is hoarse all the time, especially when fatigued. My face starts tingling. **it must be just a long dumb flare** i tell myself. 

I did prolozone, prp, dry needling, thought I got long covid..nothing was working..

I never quit drinking **strong coffee every day.** and until **tonight**never make the connection to silent reflux until I read someone's recent post on this reddit. And then I realize I felt way worse after dinner tonight...I had a spicy high acid meal of course. **but i still made no connection to reflux** because I felt fatigued, hoarse throat, and inflammation. I ignored that there was a sour taste in my mouth, because I had no heartburn. But I wondered why after walking felt strange chest pain..

I'm such an ignorant asshole.. I'm pretty sure I have silent reflux and have allowed to totally F me for the last several months.

I have a instant coffee stain that won't budge.. I mix instant coffee with milk and when you mix it was a spoon, you get something that is the consistency or glue or molasses. 

  
It might be ink. But doesn't made sense on many levels other than the stain being so hard to get out. I find ink stains are easy to get moving but tend to smear.

  
I don't remember a stain that wouldn't budge.. I would have thought instant coffee was,soluble but not after milk

  
Could be a 3rd thing but hard to think of what... Maybe fountain-point ink in a pen. Not surevwhat they are called type

Idk anyone here apart from my housemates.

I noticed one guy at the gym who would frequently make eye contact and became a familiar face so we just politely smiled at each other whenever I saw him at the gym. (Completely normal right?)

Then I started noticing he would always wait for me to finish my workout even though he‚Äôs been there way before me. Like he would leave exactly at the same time that I leave which obviously would have led to a little small talk here and there. (Found it strange but I just ignored it and made friendly small talk)

I started seeing him as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù I see regularly at the gym and honestly idk anyone here so it felt nice to know someone if that makes sense.

A few days ago he asked if I‚Äôd like to go to the beach and I‚Äôm assuming it as was friends right? So I said yea sure.

He picked me up, barely spoke because he had nothing to talk about. I tried to initiate conversation topics but he couldn‚Äôt hold a convo at all. Spent like 20 min at the beach? He took a selfie video at the beach and included me in it which was weird but ok.. then he said let‚Äôs go get something to eat/drink & I just had lunch & coffee so I didn‚Äôt want to. Then he kept asking what I wanna do? It was so awkward I said let‚Äôs just head back. 

Oh and also at the gym he noticed a mark on my neck (it was a hickey (long story, unrelated)) and he asked me what happened? I said it‚Äôs a rash. He also asked if I have a bf & I‚Äôve had one before. 

That whole thing was just awkward. I didn‚Äôt go to the gym yesterday as I had some plans and he called me to ask if I‚Äôm coming to the gym??? wtf? Is that even normal? 

He wanted to go out again this Saturday and I said I have other plans. The whole thing was so awkward with so much awkward silence and 0 convo idk why he even wants to go out again. How do I tell him no politely if he asks again? ",2,1738211630.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been doing this for months‚Äîalways polite, keeping to myself, never bothering anyone.

Today, I got kicked out for not buying something. A barista told me, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not buying anything, you have to leave.‚Äù And I was just like, ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ okay.‚Äù It caught me off guard because this has never happened before.

The thing is, I can‚Äôt just stay home. My parents require me to leave the house in the mornings, and Starbucks is the only place close enough to walk to. The nearest library doesn‚Äôt open until 11 AM, and it‚Äôs a 15-minute drive but my parents have me on a schedule to leave the house by NO LATER than 8 AM. So if I can‚Äôt stay at Starbucks, I‚Äôm basically stuck outside in 30-degree weather, nose running, hands frozen, feeling like I‚Äôm auditioning for Elsa.

I get that businesses have policies, but what 17-year-old can afford $10 coffees every day just to have a warm place to sit? I love studying there, but now I don‚Äôt know what to do.. I understand the policies I really do but seriously? it‚Äôs very cold outside and there‚Äôs literally no where to go because my strict schedule.

The only way for my situation is to really stop going to the forever and just somehow convince them to change my schedule so I can leave the house when the libary is open then I go study, thanks for those who listened and if you have any advice let me know. Sorry if this is too personal, but this all happened because of the policy so it‚Äôs gonna be really hard to talk to my parents I don‚Äôt think they would give me money, maybe my grandma or they can just let me change my schedule i am almost 18 I should be able to do my own schedule I have straight As üåö

I've had headaches my entire adult life, not really migraines, just chronic headaches. It was usually 2-4 times a week but after starting Sumatriptan about 7 years ago, it's been about every day. From what I've read on here, I'm lucky my health insurance gives me enough pills for this. I cycle in and out of rebound-headache-land. Sometimes I'm blessed with periods of 2-3 days without headaches but that's rare. 

  
However, I went on a month long vacation over the holidays and after about a week or so, I stopped having headaches. I could eat as much sugar, drink as much coffee or alcohol as I wanted - it took noticeably longer to develop a headache. I guess the stress I put myself under in my daily life was the culprit. Now I feel stupid ever wondering if it was anything else.

Day 1 back to normal life after vacation, I started getting headaches again. But last week I decided to consciously and constantly de-stress throughout the day. Since then, it's been an all day battle to take things a little slower and try to reduce my blood pressure by sheer will. But, my 10 day headache streak is now a 5 day no-headache streak. Except for last night, I had a big ass beer in a crowded restaurant with my two toddlers running around, pretty hard to keep relaxed in that situation.

I know this might sound like a joke, but it's true. I'm hoping this technique continues working. It feels like I cracked the Da Vinci Code or something.

And that's very weird but I guess it's also not that bad. One moment you can be hyper whilst being extremely tired but you can go from being hyper and than extremely tired very freaking fast. 

One moment you can be drinking a can of red bull and bam hyper, but wait what happens after you feel hyper and awake for that moment? You get tired and exhausted. 

ADHD isn't ""quirky"", ""cute"" or a disorder you would want. 

ADHD is tiring but it is very unique. 

ADHD has its ups and downs.


**Here's the downside of having ADHD**

* when you drink coffee or caffeinated beverages (for example: red bull) you either become tired or hyper, awake or even both hyper and tired.

* your brain doesn't shut off when you want it too.

* your memory becomes like bleh, your memory is bad and it's horrible for when your trying to learn new things and etc

* you will have emotional dysregulation. what's that? well think about mood swings and being angry more often (low frustration tolerance) you will even feel irritated and I don't remember what else.

* you will (maybe?) have executive functioning

* you will be tired and I mean tired. maybe even ""wired but tired."". 

* you will have difficulty focusing and you will know the difference between not focusing because of anxiety and not focusing because of ADHD.

* you will be bored at times and it's horrible.

* you will have trouble falling asleep. it's effing difficult. 


**Here's the upside of ADHD**

* you will get creativity even at random times and it will amaze you

* you will (maybe?) be good at problem solving skills

* you may or may not be multi-talented, with more than one hobby. 

* when you really are focused on something interesting you'll get hyperfocused. (but that's not always a good thing)

I knew in my mind that there was an unresolved issue and it could hurt me badly. But my heart kept on telling my mind na I should trust you. Kasi for the past months, you made me trust you. I trusted you with my fragile heart. All the tiny pieces of it. And the moment you came clean last January 19th, you broke me. I was devastated. It felt like I got broken for the 3rd time. You knew how I got broken. You knew the traumas I had in the past which I had been working on kasi ayokong maapektohan kung ano man meron tayo. With the lies you told me, I started doubting the things you showed and told me. I doubted every move. I even doubted my worth. Na dapat hindi. I asked myself so many times from that Sunday if I would still be willing to save this. My answer was always YES. But after reflecting, I don‚Äôt deserve this. I didn‚Äôt deserve to be manipulated, get lied to, and get hurt. I didn‚Äôt deserve my feelings to be manipulated by someone who isn‚Äôt sure of what they want. And most importantly, you don‚Äôt deserve me. You don‚Äôt deserve the love I gave you. 

But even after the pain you caused me, I still forgive you. I‚Äôm not forgiving you because I want you to feel relieved. I am forgiving you for my own self. I don‚Äôt want to move on with my life having this grudge towards people. 

If you are worried and afraid I might out you to your family, think again. If you‚Äôre afraid, I might message Nilko or Phillip, think again. I am not that kind of person. I won‚Äôt get revenge or get even. 

Still, I wish you all the best in life. I wish you won‚Äôt do the same thing you did to me to other people. I wish you clarity on things you want and don‚Äôt want. I wish you find happiness without the expense of you getting hurt just like what you did to me. 

Lastly, I wish you remember me in all that you do. I hope you remember me when you visit our favorite stores, when you get your coffee at Starbucks, when you see a Fuggler, when you go to Trinoma or the places we went together. And I hope that the silence I‚Äôll be giving you now, the silence you chose in the first place, won‚Äôt haunt you forever.

I decided to hunt it down on my own and was able to find her. Her username is clickable and gives you all of her reviews as a user. Out of the 24 reviews she has provided, every single one is a 1 star review from multiple different hotel brands. This is certainly a person who is doing her best to receive compensation or is truly just a hostile unhappy individual. Or both. 

  
Thank you all for your responses.

For some context, I work on a property that frequently has many homeless/unhoused transients that attempt to loiter inside the hotel. We have had many that will find our restrooms and proceed to lock themselves in there, use sinks to shower, leave the bathrooms in terrible condition, steal from our coffee shop, visit other floors to try and find a place to lay down etc etc.

We are a nice property, high rates, borderline luxury. Our lobby has our front desk, coffeeshop and bar with four single restrooms that close with a door (not stalls but each a separate restroom) when you turn the lock it will note vacant/occupied on the outside.

Now in this case we had this patron walk through our lobby very early in the morning around 7am, did not stop by the desk to check in or ask for directions anywhere. She came in, found our bar restrooms and went in. Our bar restrooms are open but the bar lounge is not, however our lounge is open seating so you can enjoy items from the coffee shop.

One of our housekeeping attendants was servicing the restrooms when this woman walked in. The attendant then left the bar area and began cleaning the lounge area. She made her way back after about 25 minutes and noticed the same restroom was occupied. As it had been some time, our attendant knocked and asked if everything was okay. According to the attendant, she did not receive an answer so she knocked again at which point the patron was very frustrated and opened the door saying its occupied. The patrons version of events is that the housekeeping attendant ignored her saying the bathroom was occupied and let herself in using her keys to open the restroom.

The patron brings up her grievance with my FO manager who apologizes and lets her know that perhaps the attendant didnt hear her and was concerned for her safety. The patron disgruntled walks back to the lobby. She is carrying a backpack and goes to our coffee shop to buy a coffee. During her order she is very rude and abrasive, but with her coffee goes back to the lobby area and sits for another two hours. After two hours she goes back to use the restroom for another twenty minutes, taking her backpack and belongings with her. When she comes back out and sits in a new area, she takes out her laptop to work. At this point one of the security guards comes and questions her on whether or not she is a guest and/or if she needs assistance in any way. She becomes frustrated, goes to our FO manager upset claiming harassment and she treated unfairly due to her race (she is black). Our FO Manager apologizes again and tries to explain we are just trying to do our due diligence in safety and security. She ended up leaving and filed a corporate complaint that we kicked her out because of her race and that she was being watched the whole time and everyone she encountered was racist. For additional context the security guard that spoke with her is Chinese, FO Manager is Filipino, and housekeeping attendant is Chinese.

We find out she has status with our hotel brand, not introductory status but one level up which no one knew because she wasnt a guest. I do believe we could have continued to let her work and keep to herself, and this is where my manager made the mistake. There were two other men in the lounge, both talking, both white males, that security did not question or speak to so the optics of only speaking to her dont look good.

I will be calling her as this is now a corporate complaint and will of course let her know that each hotel staff member will be followed up with, and that our intention was not for her or anyone to feel harassed or discriminated against.

My question for an opinion is that cases like these will always ask for some sort of compensation or the whole ""well what else are you going to do about it?"". Because race and harassment are big hot buttons, any tips on how to navigate the conversation?",21,1738210747.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,25,0.96,False

I am travelling to Sydney for the first time this weekend and will arrive at 06:35 a.m. on Monday morning. I am wondering what people do when they arrive that early and their hotel cannot guarantee them an early check-in. It must happen to most people traveling from N. America. Is hanging out in a coffee shop the only option other than paying $300 for an extra night at the hotel, if they even have a room ( I have not asked yet)?

Instead of Saiki and Teruhashi switching roles, I thought it would be fun to imagine Kaido switching with Saiki while Teruhashi switches with Aren.

Shun ‚Äî> Kusuo: he had his powers since he was born, but they only really became a problem around end of elementary school/start of middle school. His mother was obviously shocked but taught Shun that he still had to study and that he can‚Äôt rely on his powers for everything. Still, like Kusuo, he misused his powers a little bit and ended up having to transfer schools around age 11-12. He‚Äôs still a bit of a genuine chuunibyou, but he just tells his family and the other psychics that it‚Äôs a cover to his real powers. 

Aren ‚Äî> Kokomi: Aren‚Äôs anger management issues used to be extremely terrible when he was younger. His parents taught him to physically defend himself if people ever gave him trouble, but it happened so constantly that he ended up picking fights with lots of people. It got so bad at his last school that he was expelled and subsequently had to transfer to PK Academy, where he promised to himself that he would be the perfect pretty guy. Though he still is almost constantly angry or stressed. 

Kusuo ‚Äî> Shun: Kusuo doesn‚Äôt have any powers, but he is incredibly intuitive and intelligent, still rivaling his own brother. People are always trying to get his help on schoolwork and group projects, which he despises. His intelligence is effortless, meaning he can do a lot of work easily and quickly. He especially dislikes group projects because he‚Äôd rather spend time at home either playing video games or eating coffee jelly.

Kokomi ‚Äî> Aren: Her brother was a delinquent. She wanted to be one too, considering he‚Äôs really the only role model she has, but he didn‚Äôt let her join his gang because he wanted Kokomi to go down a good path. She mistook this as discrimination, and decided to join a female only gang instead (I‚Äôd imagine that this Kokomi leans into sukeban ideology and aesthetics). She‚Äôd quit her gang shortly before coming to PK, reconciling with her brother after finding out the real reason he didn‚Äôt want her to become a delinquent. Since then, she really only intimidates people who cause trouble to others, still having the reputation of a former delinquent but not necessarily as a bad thing. 

What made Kaido and Kuboyasu‚Äôs original dynamic really good was the fact that Kaido didn‚Äôt let himself get held up on Kuboyasu‚Äôs past, so I thought that element should stay. I think in this alternate universe, the situation would be more like this:
Kuboyasu transfers, and everyone is all over him. He tries his best to act polite, but he feels intensely annoyed the entire day. This scares off Kaido at first, which Kuboyasu notices. He later sees Kaido and tries to say hi, but Kaido is way too scared to say hi back which Kuboyasu misinterprets (like Teruhashi‚Äôs introduction episode). At some point when the two are (awkwardly) hanging out together, they run into someone Kuboyasu has previously beaten up before. Kaido defends Kuboyasu and the two start to become real friends.

I wouldn‚Äôt say I ship saiteru romantically, but I think their dynamic is fun. I think they would play out like this:
For the first few months, Teruhashi avoids Saiki because he‚Äôs studious, so she misattributes his personality to a kissass. During something like the Okinawa trip, she learns that he just wants to study and enjoy his hobbies in peace. She decides to fend off the people who keep bothering Saiki, which sometimes causes even more trouble than before. 

Kaido and Saiki‚Äôs friendship in the original show is one of the first we see, so I think it‚Äôs important to elaborate on that as well:
Kaido knows Saiki is incredibly smart and he sometimes notices things that even Kaido didn‚Äôt realize before, so he likes keeping Saiki nearby. Saiki tolerates Kaido‚Äôs company because Kaido never asks him for help on the actual work, only trying to socialize instead (which Saiki still isn‚Äôt exactly happy about, but it‚Äôs better than trying to teach a topic to someone who‚Äôs only trying to use him for a passing grade). 

Lastly, Teruhashi and Kuboyasu don‚Äôt have the most prominent bond in the original show, but I really feel like they should at least be friends in this rendition of Saiki K. Their canon selves are already pretty similar. 
Teruhashi is initially somewhat smitten by Kuboyasu‚Äôs charms, but she thinks he‚Äôs also a former delinquent based on his mannerisms (he‚Äôs not exactly doing it on purpose, it‚Äôs just that he‚Äôs not used to pretending to be perfect and pretty yet). 

Here are the other swaps I thought of if anyone‚Äôs curious:

Nendo <‚Äî> Hairo

Rifuta <‚Äî> Saiko

Chiyo <‚Äî> Toritsuka

Mera ‚Äî> Aiura ‚Äî> Akechi

Sora (Kaido‚Äôs sister) <‚Äî> Kusuke 

Toki (Kaido‚Äôs brother) <‚Äî> Yuuta
