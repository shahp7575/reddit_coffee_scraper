Focalin XR-

Do not drink caffeine or take nicotine with this medication. Focalin is extremely potent and will cause jitters and anxiety if you combine with other stimulants. I learned this after getting off Focalin and onto Concerta. I quit nicotine and stopped drinking coffee and went back to Focalin and realized more success. Also, taking focalin after eating protein also helped a ton. I am currently on 20mg XR and feel comfortable with this dose.

  
Concerta-

  
Really disappointed that this one didnt work out. Felt great, loved the calmness, and enjoyed my life for the first time in years. The downside to concerta was that I never felt the level of cognitive function that I felt on Focalin. Concerta helped me quit nicotine and coffee pretty easily though.

  
Overall, I will be asking my doctor if there are any other alternatives. I really loved the calmness and natural personality I had on Concerta, but I also love the focus and memory I have on Focalin. ADHD meds, WOOO!",2,1735063460.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1hliyrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1hliyrz/low_acid_coffee_benefits_why_its_a_gamechanger/,Low Acid Coffee Benefits: Why It‚Äôs a Game-Changer for Coffee Lovers,"Coffee is one of the most beloved beverages worldwide, but for some people, its acidity can cause discomfort. Low acid coffee is gaining popularity as a gentler alternative that still delivers the rich taste and caffeine kick without upsetting your stomach. In this article, we‚Äôll explore the top benefits of low acid coffee and why it might be the perfect choice for you.

# 1. Gentle on the Stomach

Low acid coffee reduces the risk of acid reflux, heartburn, and stomach irritation. If you have a sensitive stomach or suffer from GERD, switching to low acid coffee can make your coffee experience much more enjoyable.

# 2. Reduces Tooth Enamel Erosion

Acidic drinks, including regular coffee, can erode tooth enamel over time. Low acid coffee is less harsh on your teeth, reducing the risk of enamel damage and tooth sensitivity.

# 3. Improved Digestion

High-acid beverages can disrupt digestion for some individuals. Low acid coffee minimizes digestive discomfort, making it a better choice for those with gastrointestinal issues.

# 4. Rich in Antioxidants

Low acid coffee retains essential antioxidants, which help fight inflammation, reduce oxidative stress, and support overall health.

# 5. Better Taste for Some Palates

Low acid coffee often has a smoother, milder flavor profile, with less bitterness. Coffee drinkers who prefer a less tangy taste often enjoy low acid coffee.

# 6. Supports a Healthy Gut

The lower acidity levels can promote a healthier gut environment, reducing irritation in the stomach lining and maintaining gut health.

# 7. Ideal for Acid Reflux Sufferers

Acid reflux sufferers often find regular coffee triggers symptoms. Low acid coffee provides a satisfying alternative without causing flare-ups.

# 8. Reduces Risk of Heartburn

Heartburn is a common issue among coffee drinkers. Low acid coffee minimizes the chances of experiencing heartburn after drinking coffee.

# 9. Suitable for People with IBS

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) sufferers can find relief by switching to low acid coffee, as it‚Äôs less likely to trigger symptoms.

# 10. Great for Daily Consumption

If you drink coffee multiple times a day, low acid coffee is a healthier option that reduces the cumulative effects of acidity on your body.

# How to Choose the Best Low Acid Coffee

¬∑¬†Look for brands labeled specifically as ""low acid.""

¬∑¬†Opt for coffee beans grown in regions with naturally lower acidity.

¬∑¬†Choose dark roast coffee, as it typically has lower acid levels.

# Final Thoughts

Low acid coffee offers a range of benefits, from digestive relief to dental health protection, making it an excellent choice for those with sensitive stomachs or acid-related issues. With its smooth flavor and health advantages, it‚Äôs no wonder that low acid coffee is becoming increasingly popular.

Switching to low acid coffee might just transform your daily coffee ritual into a more enjoyable and health-friendly experience. Give it a try and savor the benefits with every sip!",1,1735063415.0,coffee_kitchen,0,1.0,False

1hlivrm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hlivrm,Fuji Film...inside look..,"I decided I wanted you all to see things that I know you have never seen. I think it's awesome to be able to see behind the scenes of a company from a employee's view!  I loaded up 20 pics...and will describe each, so here we go!

1. This is the back side of the DC PLANT. This is the main hub, which products are sent thru, (from ANYWHERE, and produced here, and also inbound from Charleston , SC)  These people STAY busy! I took this on a Sunday as no one was around..this is a huge plant.

2. A SIDE image of the DC plant entrance...

3.As u may be aware, the Japanese are extremely fanatical about us staying healthy (they built us a nature walk trial next to the site cutting thru the woods and streams so we can get fresh air on breaks if we want, or when we are off).  I took this just before I started walking...about 3 miles! It beautiful!

4. SOME OF YOUR 35 Mm Film cases returned to us!  I used to make little storage cases from them! Shhhh.

5. This is the ADMINISTRATIVE plant..and to left is the GRAPHIC plant.. P PLANT.  As a slang, we all call this the ""CRYSTAL PALACE"". This is where the head execs and such work..two story building.. the P plant also produces graphic type printing for magazines and such...if that's makes sense to you. P plant was the first plant built.  I always would smile seeing ppl wearing suits and ties to work....as japanese culture...isn't really like that..innthis atmosphere...

6.  This is a side exit. Leaving the P plant..

7. This is an image of me removing silver halide, at a small scale test device. I will then apply those results to capture ""mega tons"" of silver on a grand scale..to be sold on stock market or other companies. 

8. I think you will really like this.. these are a mixture of  a variety of COATED MASTER ROLLS(see how they are wrapped in black special plastic) no light touches them, placed according to what product it is..etc.. and you also see UNCOATED ROLLS, ready to be  coated..you also see the load spindles supporting the master rolls.
This is one HUGE HUGE HUGE warehouse..it is KEPT AT A PERFECT HUMIDITY, AND TEMPERATURE for the product.  Most people overlook that.  Humidity effect on paper. This place is so huge, if I walk it alone at night, I get scared some monster is in there hiding, (like X files)

9. This is just inside the entrance lobby at P PLANT on the CRYSTAL PALACE side.  

10. This is the desk of the front security or secretary that you would see if you walked in the p plant admin side..however, they are multiple entrances..this is more considered a public entrance for ppl off the street.

11. This is looking up the staircase to the head execs offices and such...president...etc..

12 AND 13.  OUR FIRE truck, pulling up to P plant to give training to associates....yes we have our own fire team. And response.

16 and 17.  Japanese and fuji are huge on Japanese flowers...these are cherry blossoms..during the spring as they fall it looks nothing short  of amazing and at dusk, they seem to glow!  I loved them so much, I planted som at my house.  I cannot put into words the feeling it is to see this in person...

18.  These are ""SUPER SACKS"" They contain dried gelatin(ok what is that?). It is the same coating on coated pills to make it easier to swallow...what does that have to do with photography?  Go touch a picture..feel that slickness?
This is gelatin..and it is created from OX BONES OR COW BONES. Just a a trivia, we used to source it from Canada. At one time.

19 an 20.  Me, holding a 35mm case at the K PLANT , and rejects from the X PLANT..MUGS and such.
The misprint mugs and such are supposed to be destroyed,  ...lol..supposed.  but, who would not want a free coffee mug?

I think, its important to see a company from an employee's perspective!
I got 30 years of behind the scenes videos and pics..  EVEN how we create products, talking to my friends as they make your stuff..this site was so huge, that even after 30 years, they were places there even I didn't understand...
LET THAT SINK IN...

I disagree with Puff Shroom being an S-Tier plant, as some famous PVZ1'ers say. Sure, free spamming to the point where you can set up lots of defenses is cool, with it especially being prevalent in nights, but it doesn't work against all zombies. Notably, Balloon Zombies can fly over these, Zombonis and Catapult Zombies can roll over them, Digger Zombies go under them, Imps from Gargantuars are usually thrown over them, Jalapeno Zombies make their spam useless, multiple zombies are either way too strong or downright impossible to kill without multiple of them, and in Survival Night or Fog, there are too many generic zombies to keep up with.  
One ""counterpoint"" is that PVZ1 can be beaten without Sunflowers or Sun Shrooms with Puff Shroom as the best plant for that challenge. Okay, what's next? PVZ1 can be beaten while doing a handstand? PVZ1 can be beaten while swimming? Can Puff Shroom be the GOAT in these challenges? The counterpoint is for only one challenge and is very vague. Also, you can't do survival night or fog without sunflowers.

Another counterpoint is that Gargantuars can be stalled infinitely by Puff Shrooms when paired with Snow Pea or Winter Melons. Keywords: when paired with. Are you seriously praising one plant's ability if you need another plant to back it up? That's not a very good point then.

The last counterpoint is that they are good in sunny levels and Versus with Coffee Bean. Again: WITH. That made Puff Shroom more dependent. I don't agree with those points, then.

Overall, I don't consider Puff Shroom to be a top tier plant. Maybe move it down to B-Tier, because that's the highest I would rank it.",1,1735063015.0,PlantsVSZombies,0,1.0,False

I make iced lattes 2x day. I‚Äôm also interested in hot drinks but I found the milk steaming underwhelming (similar to the breville bambino I just switched from).

I see there are a bunch of mods and it seems the gaggiuino is the gold standard. But frankly I am a little intimidated by the length of time I could sink into this and the fact that there doesn‚Äôt appear to be a video guide and it‚Äôs primarily written instructions and relying on a discord server. 

I also see recommendations to just install a PID and do the OPV mod but I‚Äôm curious if it makes sense to just go full gaggiuino due to the minimal cost differential and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs similar in terms of labor. 

Curious to hear others thoughts, I really don‚Äôt want to spend an excessive amount of time tinkering here and I truly have modest needs when it comes to my coffee. 

I also thought about just selling this and taking a shot on the apex v2 as it does everything I‚Äôd need.

I only have $250 into this machine. I would likely sell it for $300-$350 and I believe the gaggiuino mod is $150. So all in all I could go this route and be about $400-$500 into it or just say F it and buy the apex v2. ",1,1735062811.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been on every diet out there! üò© I‚Äôve been 200+ pounds for years with no hope in sight, until one day my doctor suggested Zepbound. üôåüèΩ Initially I thought, here we go again, but every week I lost something! This medication works! If you are apprehensive about starting, START, if you are reading about the side effects here, yes some people have side effects, but most folks don‚Äôt. Here are a few tips from my experience: 
1. I walked 10K steps daily from April-October 
2. I drink Failife protein shakes before working out 
3. I used to eat one or two boiled eggs, raisins toast (half slice) with black coffee for breakfast and salad with grilled chicken for lunch. Dinner was basically the same or with steamed veggies. Nothing after 7pm. 
4. Strength training two days weekly to build muscle. Please do this üôèüèΩüò© 
5. I titrated up if I noticed I wasn‚Äôt losing. I did six weeks on 2.5 because I stopped losing, I actually gained a pound on 5.0 üò© and did excellent on 7.5 but due to the shortage at the time, I titrated up to 
10.0. I stayed on 10.0 for eight weeks, and 12.5 for six weeks. Now I‚Äôm in maintenance on 15.0, every 10-14 days. 
6. The food noise comes and goes. The most effective doses were 2.5 and 7.5. I get fuller more quickly on the higher doses. I noticed I lost my appetite for greasy foods and alcohol. I used to drink two glasses of wine socially at an event, and today I can barely drink more than two sips. üò© 
7. This is a lifetime commitment. After 20+ years I no longer take blood pressure medication, I now take Zepbound. üôåüèΩüôèüèΩ
8. Please work with a good doctor while on your journey. Remember, this is your journey. Embrace the new you! You‚Äôre already amazing, but in 2025, the hope is that you‚Äôll be amazingly more healthy! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",35,1735062487.0,Zepbound,5,1.0,False

Having said that, I don't think the model works anymore in the US, by far the biggest market. It's just too easy for another company to produce an even better cup of coffee in an even cooler place. Honestly, many push button cappuccino machines are as good as Starbucks (but with fewer add-in variations).

People sometimes compare Starbucks to McDonalds. However, it's extremely difficult to copy McDonalds. Any food truck can copy Starbucks.

When I visited China earlier this year, I was struck by how unpopular Starbucks was becoming. Local brands are popping up that are cheaper and sometimes cooler. Every time I met Chinese friends, they proposed a different coffee shop. Never Starbucks.

My hope is that the new CEO can rein in costs, as the $8 coffee that seems to be chasing too many clients away. Every office now has a Nespresso or Keurig machine in the lunchroom. I'm not in love with Keurig, but it's ok and I can't justify spending so much each day on something like coffee.

I‚Äôve got this best friend, June 29M (Also white), who‚Äôs like a brother to me. Every year during the holidays, we hang out at my parents‚Äô place. Four years ago, June met this girl, April 24 F, and from the moment she met my mom, they just clicked.  

April‚Äôs from the same ethnicity as my family, and I feel like that‚Äôs why my mom bonded with her so easily. At first, I was super happy about it‚Äîmy mom liked April, and that meant she was less on my case. Everyone seemed cool with their friendship. My mom is kinda lonely, so having April around was nice for her‚Äîthey‚Äôd grab coffee, go book shopping, stuff like that.  

But here‚Äôs the problem: July‚Äôs not feeling it. She‚Äôs got this jealousy thing‚Äînot just because my mom and April are tight, but also because my parents are always hyping April up, saying how beautiful she is. July‚Äôs got insecurities about her looks, and I can see how that‚Äôs been hitting her hard.  

This year, July planned our holidays away from my family, which means no June and no April either. My mom was chill about it, didn‚Äôt fight me on it. But June told me April was sad about the whole thing.

I passed the exam a couple of hours ago (exam stopped at 100), and what a roller coaster of emotions it was! 

If I could share a few key takeaways from my experience, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd recommend:

1. **Focus on understanding concepts, not memorization**: Truly grasp the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind each topic‚Äîthis will help you in both the exam and real-life scenarios.

2. **Set your exam date**: No one ever feels 100% ready. Commit to a timeline and stick to it.

3. **Master the art of elimination**: Knowing the purpose and context of topics allows you to confidently eliminate incorrect answers, which is invaluable for tricky questions.

4. **Adopt a managerial mindset**: For around 20‚Äì25 questions, I found that thinking like a manager was crucial for answering correctly.

5. **Take care of yourself**: Ensure you eat well and get proper sleep the night before. A fresh mind makes all the difference during the exam.

6. **Keep a tab on time** **during exam**: Time flies during exam ;) 

**My Prep Detail:**

1. Pete Zerger CRAM Videos (Really IMP 10/10)

2. LearnZAPP - Did close to 1000 questions (couple of full practice test and few custom tests) 8/10

3. QE - Really good. Exam questions format pretty much matches with it. QE indeed is harder when it comes to eliminating options. Exam had two easy non-relevant options  (sometimes( to eliminate.  (9/10)

4 Dest Cert MindMap: Really helpful (8/10)

5. Prabh Nair : This guy is good. Watched his coffee shots and a lot of other videos 9/10.

6. Of course, my work experience helped (7+ yr in Network Security)

  
I heard from others that when the exam ends and the result gets printed, the invigilator usually says ‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù if you‚Äôve passed. After my exam, I was sitting outside with my eyes closed, praying, when the invigilator handed me the piece of paper without saying anything. My heart was racing‚ÄîI was convinced I had failed. But when I looked at the paper and saw the word ‚ÄúCongratulations!‚Äù‚Äîoh man, I almost cried.

Looks like the invigilator was sticking to the ‚Äú**ethical behavior/need-to-know principles**"" ;)

I‚Äôve stopped celebrating any holidays with my nparents, as it‚Äôs always far too anxiety inducing to be worth it. However, my mother insisted she at least come by for an hour for a cup of coffee.

Why, she got me a pair of very expensive ‚ÄúUGG‚Äù-branded house slippers I‚Äôm never going to wear. And then got mad that I‚Äôm not super thrilled for the amazing gift.

I‚Äôve explicitly told her many, many times to ASK before getting me something like that. She‚Äôs not rich and has gotten in financial trouble in the past due to being irresponsible with her money.

I‚Äôve been LC with her for a few years, but she seems oblivioys to it. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs malicious in any way, but has always behaved like an immature child and it‚Äôs just so frustrating to feel like I‚Äôm the only adult between the three of us sometimes (including nfather, but that‚Äôs a different story for a different time‚Ä¶).

So long story short, I was saving up for a beginner level setup ($1000-$1200 budget) for christmas this year... but ultimately decided to splurge out on gifts for me and my SO's family. 

I guess luck/karma was in my favor, because I got a small bonus at work + got some extra cash from distant relatives hehe

So I basically got my budget back for a new setup! For reference, I've been exclusively making pourovers at home and drinking espresso stuff at local coffee shops.

*Budget:* $1000-$1200 after tax and shipping

*What I'm looking for/needs:*
- 2-4 drinks a day 

- I'd mainly make hot/iced Americanos, but would want a milk option every so often for SO, family, and friends

- Willing to mod, but I highly prefer using something ready to go

- Relatively easy to maintain/clean/repair

- Drinking mainly light to medium roasted beans

- Needs to last 5 years minimum (Although I think most can easily last that with regular maintenance)

*Currently I have:*
- Kingrinder K6 
- Fellow EKG kettle
- Cheap scale that measures .01

*What I'm considering:*
Setup 1:
- Bambino Plus
- DF54/64

Setup 2:
- Flair 58+ (v2) 
- Use my Kingrinder K6 for now
- Milk Frother (Nanofoamer???) 

Setup 3: 
- Say YOLO and get a profitec go
- Use my K6 for now
- Get by without accessories for now


Preferably I'd like to keep it close to the $1000 mark after everything... but I've heard great things about the Profitec Go! But that alone would put me at the $1k mark already before any additional accessories and gear. 

Tl;Dr
- Beginner to world of espresso, but been using a v60 the last 2 years

- $1000-$1200 budget after tax/shipping but prefer being close to $1k

- Mainly drink Americanos at cafes about 60-70% of time, with milk based drinks being the rest

- Deciding between a Bambino+ / Flair 58+ /Profitec Go based on what I have & dont have",2,1735060679.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

My next bag Im considering is the lychee co-ferment from S&W and im hoping to explore coffees from B&W this next year as ive learned I love funky flavors and experimental processes. Some standouts from my first year exploring different coffees would be: 

Lost sock 2 steps: my first bag and first step into the rabbit hole, realizing that coffee doesnt just have to taste like ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù got a second bag a month or 2 ago and still has a special place in my heart

Kirkland ethiopian: nothing crazy but an amazing cheap bean that treated me well while money was tight this year

Vigilante natty cheffe: Ive been craving another bag of this, tops the blueberry co-ferment i got aswell as the other ethiopian natural with blueberry notes from hypergoat, absolutely embodies the term blueberry bomb

Glitch coffee columbia nitro washed: honestly the best coffee ive ever had, super expensive but im super thankful for those around me that got it for me on their trips to japan, strong melon notes upfront with a strawberry acidity finish, absolutely loved it. 

Espresso blend from okinowa: my brother got me this on his first trip to japan, best coffee tasting coffee ive had yet, very nutty and caramelly with a velvety texture

Standout coffee: ive learned with these two that for my preferences i should pick filter roast instead of espresso roast when choosing coffees, they have hints of their flavor notes but i feel as though the slightly darker roast on them covers up the ‚Äúpoppy‚Äù flavors

Superlost solo sabado: the first washed coffee ive had that doesnt taste ‚Äúbasic‚Äù I‚Äôve been avoiding washed coffees as i didnt think they had much to offer and I was of the mindset that processing had the most effect on flavor, it really does have apple notes and not sour apple, like a nice sweet apple, i will be giving washed coffees a more fair shot going forward.

This next year Im looking to trying out more from S&W, B&W, Pirates of coffee, and whatever you guys have to recommend! Maybe that be an interesting roaster or process or origin! Please let me know what you have enjoyed this year and what I should try! ",0,1735060676.0,espresso,0,0.33,False
1hli0mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/1hli0mv/very_long_rant_wherein_i_question_my_relationship/,Very long rant wherein I question my relationship with the universe (and my sanity) - a reflection on gifts,"TLDR: I rejected a gift and I am kicking myself but also hope I helped someone else but also probably need therapy. 

Okay. This whole post sounds greedy and selfish. I‚Äôll probably delete it. But I have to put it somewhere. It‚Äôs eating at me. 

So yesterday after 10 hours of work, no food, no coffee, I rolled into Target for some ‚Äúquick, last minute‚Äù shopping. But mistake. Huge. I wandered around so long that two separate rush hours cleared out. 

As I was wandering around feeling ever-more defeated and trying to remember the second-to-last thing on my list, this guy approaches me and he says something like, ‚Äúare you shopping for gifts?‚Äù And I said yes, and he says ‚ÄúI hope this makes it easier this holiday season‚Äù and slides a $100 into my hand. 

I‚Äôm shocked. This has never happened to me before. So I hand him back the money and I tell him Thank you, and Merry Christmas, and while I do greatly appreciate this, please give the money to someone who needs it more than I do. And we chat a while and I point out a few other people who look just as tired as me, who probably would also love his generosity. And he tells me that this is one of the best joys of his holiday season and he does this every year. And we part ways. Great guy, btw, no icks detected.

And then I pay a ridiculous amount for I-don‚Äôt-even-know-what and I‚Äôm walking out to my car and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúWTF did I just do?! *I* need that money! I‚Äôm broke! Hubby is out of work! WHY did I do that?? 

So I‚Äôm cycling through my emotions last night and this morning and I have this nagging thought: The universe gifted me $100. I‚Äôve been hoping for abundance, I‚Äôve been deep breathing, I‚Äôve been grounding myself in the knowledge that things will always work out and I always have enough, and the universe provides. And the universe *provided,* *and I said No Thank You!*

Is this a self esteem issue? Do I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve good things? Is this why I‚Äôm constantly ‚Äústuck‚Äù where I am? Probably. Is this a good karma point? Did me saying ‚Äúno‚Äù mean that the person who was *meant* to receive the money got the money? What if I was the one who was meant to receive the money? What if the person he gave the $100 to after me was like my shady relative who has a million in the bank but would gladly say hey great thanks, and take the money? But maybe that relative just accepts gifts from the universe while I turn my nose up at them.

I looked up at the stars last night and I said ‚ÄúI hope that money made it to someone who really needs it.‚Äù And that is true. I know what it‚Äôs like to have literally nothing in the bank account and scraping by with $1. Now, we have abundance, in so many ways. 

So this isn‚Äôt necessarily a question about $100. And I reallly don‚Äôt want this to come off as me being a martyr or whatever - that isn‚Äôt it. I was braindead in the middle of a crowded shopping center and *clearly not thinking clearly* at the time. 

Could someone please just help me realign this conflict in my brain? I‚Äôm kicking myself for not accepting this gift, and kicking myself for being upset about not accepting this gift, and thinking about how I could have used the $100, and hoping someone got the money and it made their holidays really special. Did I just piss off the universe by rejecting abundance? I know it doesn‚Äôt work that way. But, *does it work that way??* 

Look. It‚Äôs a stupid thing. Really stupid. $100 is material, it‚Äôs not something to fret over. $100 could be meaningless to a millionaire. $100 could be lifesaving to other people. But it just led me to this ‚Äúdo I reject all good in my life?‚Äù question, do I feel undeserving? Does the law of attraction not work if you‚Äôre rejecting everything good in your life? What other good have I rejected? Did I just curse myself and change the power of the law of attraction or something??

Ya‚Äôll. I need some *sense.*

1hlhzba,https://www.reddit.com/r/FODMAPS/comments/1hlhzba/athletic_greens_ag1/,Athletic Greens (AG1),"Middle-aged male from the UK. Reasonably fit and healthy with a not-so-bad BMI.

Dietary diagnosis by NHS Dietician and Gastroenterologist as intolerant of lactose, fructose, caffeine and, oddly, high fat content foods/plates? 

I have been curious to try AG1 for quite a long time. My rationale (right or wrong) is I personly believe I am missing out on important foods for health that I can't digest. 

My food shop budget (v.good food costs a LOT in the UK) and food-prep time (long work hours and erratic work schedule) are both limited. 

Therefore, I have been eager to try this AG1 'thing'. I have always err'd on the side of caution knowing we're talking a day of misery if the outcome backfires (forgive the pun) on me. Additionally, home research showed me very inconsistent results, with the majority saying it was nothing less than moderate FODMAP. Some search returns even saying high and certain to cause chronic side effects?

Last week i realised I had time off alone  approaching with plenty of time where I didn't have to do anything if I didn't want/need to. So, I took the gamble and bought a one off purchase. It wouldn't take long to find out of it was a bad idea and in 24 hours I could say ""... been there, got the t-shirt & no thanks!"". 

Example of sensitivity.:
I only have to have a little onion gravy on an otherwise FODMAP friendly plate of food and, 45 minutes later, I am dispensing black coffee a le derri√®re at high power like a flame-thrower; which, on and off, can last several hours.

Took my first AG1 ration on Monday and braced myself. In prep, I had fasted from 7pm Sunday and took my first 350ml at 12.30pm Monday. So 17ish hours with nothing in front of it to complicate any results and I didn't eat for a further 4 hours (I fast quite regularly, so this was no problem for me).

By 1pm I had a real all over sweat-on, with eyes scrunched shut + panic-stations at the thought of WTF have I just done? 1.30pm.... nothing? Any minute now I was expecting those gut to brain messages of RUN, RUN for the bathroom, FAST. 

2pm. Seriously intense flatulence. As I was alone, this was hilarious and very enjoyable. Although a couple required some faith and bravery. By 4pm still nothing, except still a good rate of farting. 

Took a day off and repeat. 17 hour fast,  350ml of AG1 and wont eat for a further 5 hours. Writing this at 5'ish-pm and still no 'consequnces'. And, ... sadly, less flatulence? 

This is not an AG1 green light approval or recommendation from me to others under the FODMAP umbrella. Its up to you if you choose to give-it-a-go. But, the outcome has for me meant I now know I can tolerate it, despite the majority of reports saying it's not a great idea. 

Due to the price I am only using once every 2 days and not sure I can maintain this ¬£¬£¬£ in the very long term. I will try and afford it for a further couple of tubs and review my sense of health/self.

I'll pop in one of the heavy espresso ones expecting something particularly bold in flavor, only for it to not taste all that much different than one of the coffee pods.

He's hoping to put us in a better place financially because he has made some poor financial decisions for the lady couple of years. He wants to work a lot. He took a job that was 2 hours away without even consulting me and is working night shift. I don't really like any of it, but again, he did it without consulting me, so his choice I guess. I support him by making sure he has a really nice, fulfilling lunch and clean laundry. Making him coffee before his shift. Not much more I can do really. 

But he comes home this morning and says he almost fell asleep at the wheel, it was rough. I sympathized. Then he tells me something about work in another state that is paying really good money. But he'd have to be away for 2 months. I said, ""the kids would be devastated"". He said yeah, I can't do it. Almost as if he resents that. So I sort of got annoyed mildly and said ""why didn't you do that before we had kids? And his response was ""I wasn't raised properly (true) nd besides we used to fight all the time and I just couldn't get my head in the game"" 

Well that pissed me off. A lot. 

We did used to fight a fair amount. He was not as mature as he is now. He used to spend the majority of his money on alcoholz weed and cigarettes and fast food. He was miserable and moody all the time, and made inflammatory comments... Like that. Just rude. He would work 2 weeks out of the month and then sit at home and play video games. I pointed that out, and he just said ""well I was happier then"". 

I was working full time. Had no car, would walk everywhere in the snow. Come home and then make dinner, do all the cooking and cleaning while he just sat there. He told me that he didn't like cooking and when we bought a house would be doing all the maintenance on the place. I accepted that. Not going to get into how that panned out. That's another topic. 

But it annoyed me. We have gotten past all of that. He has matured a lot. He is less moody, he is more responsible with the money, we stated making more money, he has his own business and mishandled that, but isn't so wasteful anymore. He never plays video games anymore because he spends time with he kids when he's off work. 

Anyways, it's Christmas Eve. I am now pissed. And I'm trying to get my head sorted out. I don't want to be mad for Christmas. What's your best advice on how to just move past a stupid comment he likely made because he was exhausted but pissed me off because it's quite frankly completely unjust and makes me want to divorce him if he's ""so unhappy?"".

I'm sure you get these kinds of posts a lot, but I was told I should come and ask anyway. I apologize if these questions are too broad. I did a search for ideas (and have written some down), but anything else is helpful.

My wife and I will be visiting LA for the first time at the end of January. I'm coming for work and then we will relocate to a more centrally-located hotel. We want to plan the trip largely around food with a few other touristy odds and ends. We will rent a car as I've been told that planning your trip around Ubers/cabs is very expensive in LA. 

First, are there any areas you recommend people stay in? I'm looking for an area that's fun with bars with good vibes within walking (or short cab) distance from the hotel. Bonus points if there are nice coffee shops or breakfast spots nearby to help start the day. We're not looking for anything fancy as long as it's not too seedy.

We only have two things planned for our trip so far, so any lunch recommendations nearby those would be appreciated. We plan to go to La Brea Tarpits and Museum. We also want to do the Academy of Motion Pictures Museum (and probably the standard Hollywood touristy stuff). 

As for what we eat, everything is on the table. I've heard Koreatown is must-do. Likewise, I would love to go to Little Tokyo as I lived a while in Japan. We do love a great cocktail bar, but we also enjoy any bar with good vibes (and maybe live music or a great jukebox).

1hlhj86,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hlhj86/dialing_in_decaf_beans_breville_barista_touch/,Dialing in decaf beans [Breville Barista Touch],"Hello everyone. Happy holidays. I recently purchased a Breville Barista Touch, and I need some advice on dialing in decaf beans (I only drink decaf).

First of all, I've learned that I should shoot for a ratio of 2:1, so if I use 18-19g of coffee beans I should get a yield of 36-38g of espresso and I should do this in 25-30 seconds.

Is it more important to reach the 25-30 seconds of time, or 36-38g of yield? The way I'm trying to do it right now is to reach my yield in the 25-30 second timeframe. Once I reach my yield, I remove my cup. If I reach my yield before or after the 25-30 second timeframe, I consider that shot a failure. Furthermore, I've purchased a decent stamping tool, WDT tool, and have a new precision basket being delivered today. I think my workflow is pretty good, where I run a blank shot first to ensure the equipment is all heated, including my cup. I use the WDT tool and stamp the basket and use a puck screen. I use the manual mode of the machine and stop it when I reach my desired yield.

So, even after all this, I usually get a result that is either bitter or sour (I'm not sure exactly why, sometimes it's possible to get both bitter and sour in the same shot), and it usually doesn't have much crema (my favorite part!). I know the general consensus on this sub is to grind finer, but are there any other variables I can play with to improve my results? For example, what about brewing temp? I have it on the ""ideal"" setting currently, but maybe I can try going a notch higher/lower? Any other tips I can try?

Thanks.

In a world where you can order sushi from Tokyo, binge-watch cat videos from Siberia, and yell ‚ÄúHODL!‚Äù into the crypto void‚Äîall from your couch‚Äîone thing remains annoyingly archaic: making crypto payments easy. Sure, Bitcoin is the king of decentralized currency, but if you‚Äôve ever tried to share a wallet address like 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa (yawn), you know it feels more like deciphering ancient hieroglyphs than flexing your tech-savvy muscles.

Enter the hero of our story: the **Bitcoin QR code generator API**. Yes, folks, it‚Äôs time to ditch those endless strings of alphanumeric chaos and embrace the glorious simplicity of QR codes. Let‚Äôs explore why this humble-yet-powerful technology is the best thing to happen to Bitcoin since Satoshi Nakamoto whispered ‚Äúdecentralize everything.‚Äù

# Why QR Codes? Why Now?

Why? Because QR codes are intuitive. Instead of copying and pasting wallet addresses like some crypto caveman, users just point their phone cameras, click, and voil√†‚ÄîBitcoin magic happens.

# Meet the Bitcoin QR Code Generator API

Y'all are terrible influences. Joined this subreddit 3 months ago and it has been pretty detrimental to my bank account. I have been living off Nespresso pods at home and K pod coffee at the office for the last 5+ years and that was certainly good enough for a while.

This sub had me going from planning to buy a Bambino to a Gaggia Classic to a Profitec Go all in a matter of weeks research. I drink mostly milk based drinks so then I decided a dual boiler workflow would be ideal and put in a preorder for the Profitec Move. Once it looked like that was going to be delayed quite a bit, I started looking into other options. Did not think I would end up going the E61 route but I fell in love with the Black Profitec Pro 600 from Clive and the rest is history. Have it on a hidden smart plug that makes heating it up a breeze. Have had it for 2 months and could not be happier with it.

Took me way longer to decide on a grinder. Started with a Kingrinder K6 to hold me over while I landed on an electric grinder. Started thinking about the DF64 then moved on to the 078S or the DF83V but was afraid of quality inconsistencies. Once I found the Philos, it seemed like it gave me everything I needed from a quality and value standpoint. I drink mostly medium-dark roasts so I picked up one with the 189D burrs. I also went ahead and placed a preorder for a Zerno Z1 because I felt I may want something with a slightly smaller footprint down the line and the blind burrs seemed interesting to me. I'll end up keeping one and selling the other.

Hopefully should be done with the buying other than just beans at this point.",6,1735059015.0,espresso,5,0.88,False

Simple AITA advice needed. I (29M) live in America far from home (Asia) but went back to my parents‚Äô place to celebrate Christmas. However, like every year, it just doesn‚Äôt feel like Christmas there anymore. They‚Äôve stopped putting effort into decorating or preparing for the holidays. Instead, the house is messy and full of clutter‚Äîcouches covered in random bags, the coffee table piled with snacks, papers, and bills so there‚Äôs barely space for a coffee cup, and dining chairs stacked with appliance boxes.

My parents aren‚Äôt that old, and we even have a house caretaker who handles basic cleaning, laundry, and cooking. But they‚Äôre hoarders, and the clutter makes the house feel anything but festive. If it weren‚Äôt for the caretaker voluntarily putting up a few Christmas lights, it would feel like any other day.

I‚Äôve asked my parents multiple times to declutter and make the house feel more like a home, but they just ignore me. This year, I finally told my mom how I felt and mentioned that I‚Äôm reconsidering visiting next year. I told her I might spend Christmas somewhere else where there‚Äôs more of a festive mood. I‚Äôve never even celebrated Christmas in my own home or put up a tree there because I always come back home to spend the holidays with them. She looked disappointed and definitely hurt by my response. She hadn‚Äôt said anything except saying ‚ÄúGood night. Let‚Äôs just rest for tonight.‚Äù

In my defense, life is short not to be festive and enjoy these moments. I want to feel the magic of the season, but their lack of effort makes it all feel so lackluster. I get that Christmas is about being with loved ones, and I should be grateful for that, but it‚Äôs hard to feel the holiday spirit when the environment is so chaotic. A little effort to organize and create a festive or even welcoming vibe would mean so much‚Äîespecially since I‚Äôm usually away and cherish these visits.

Even when it comes to the dinner table, they don‚Äôt really put in much effort. AITA for feeling this way?

EDIT: i live thousands of miles away across the pacific ocean from my parents (i live in America. Them, Asia). For any one of you saying i host instead.

How lazy do you have to be to make a machine design advent calendars for you?



Inside were tiny cardboard pictures of animals, still with unnaturally human eyes.



Deer with people eyes.



Ducks with people eyes.



Dogs with people eyes.



On December 16th I noticed a pigeon staring at me. I didn‚Äôt think much of it.¬†



December was already a blur of minimum wage and too many customers and my manager staring at my ass.



On December 21st I saw the corpse of a dog while I was walking to work. Its neck was twisted a full 180.



I just walked to my job, not bothered to do anything.



On December 24th my manager, Trent, took me aside one day.



‚ÄúLook, I really want you to not have to worry about working tomorrow. Christmas shouldn‚Äôt be spent working! Unfortunately, I might need some‚Ä¶ motivation in the back room.‚Äù



I agreed. I was done. All the stress and exhaustion overwhelmed me.



Trent sat in a chair facing away from the door. I knelt in front of him.



I‚Äôm not going to elaborate on what we did.



As soon as the deed was done, I stared up at Trent. He was making direct eye contact with me.



*‚ÄúCould you quit staring at me?*‚Äù I spat.



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt fucking move my head.‚Äù



I backed away from him and slowly paced towards the door. His head followed my eyes.



I panicked. I didn‚Äôt know what was happening. I wasn‚Äôt thinking.



That‚Äôs why I rushed through the door.



‚ÄúYOU FUCKI-‚Äù



SNAP!



I could already picture his head, turned a lethal angle to maintain his gaze on me.



I ran all the way to my apartment, ignoring the sting of the cold.



I hastily opened the final slot of the calendar.



Sure enough, a tiny cardboard picture of Trent.



People with people eyes.



I felt something tracing an outline on my abdomen.



I pulled my shirt up and screamed.



There, on my stomach were fine lines carved into my skin, forming a slot.



On it, the number 25.

Hey guys! I'm just a little concerned as I've been throwing up black in the mornings. Its not every morning but its been going on every 2 weeks. 
Its usually happens 40-60mins after I have a black coffee. 
I am drinking alcohol to much lately due to stress/anxiety which I am ashamed of but just worried I've done too much damage.

1hlh99i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1hlh99i/quick_reviews_of_a_hog_christmas_order/,Quick reviews of a HoG Christmas order,"I ordered some Haus of Gloi goodies for my friend for Christmas and of course I threw in a few things for myself as well. I have previously tried their Yule line and wanted to try other things this round. 

My friend is into clean/green/fresh scents and for her I purchased:
Hair oil in**Insalata Nocturna**: In the night garden. Green Bolivian lemon, rubbed tomato leaf, black fig syrup and basil.

My thoughts: I only sniffed this from the bottle. It‚Äôs very lush, green, and surprisingly floral. The lemon is a nice touch. I‚Äôm hopeful my friend will like it!

Pumpkin butter in **Winter Divinity and Aether**: winter Divinity is a scent I‚Äôve sampled in my previous HoG Yule purchase. It‚Äôs a lovely cooling scent with just a hint of peppermint to give it a cool fresh feel. I am also hopeful she will like this one. Also got her Aether for days she doesn‚Äôt want to be scented (and especially since HoG pumpkin butter scents project so much!).

For me I purchased:

Hair oil in **Tomato Leaf and Lettuce**: I don‚Äôt typically go for these lighter scents but I wanted something that wouldn‚Äôt clash too much if I were to wear a different scent on my body for the day. This was lovely and I now think I am in love with tomato leaf. The tomato leaf is green and earthy. It reminds me a lot of helping my parents out in the garden. The lettuce adds a touch of watery freshness, not too aquatic. This one is a keeper.

Pumpkin butter in **Coffee Haus**: The Haus coffee accord! Freshly brewed coffee and hints of chocolate, caramel, almond and a touch of real coffee bean co2 extract!

My thoughts: I purchased this scent because I adore the scent of coffee shops with the fresh brewed coffee and wow. This one delivered. Coffee scents I have tried in the past were too artificial or too sweet. Coffee Haus is the perfect balance of freshly ground coffee beans, plumes of my hot black coffee wafting to my nose, and hints of flavored syrups the other patrons have in their cups. After a few hours the coffee fades a little and I get touches of buttery caramel. Just lovely. 

Freebie of **Snow Wolf**: Bristling and prowling, lonesome and haunting. Three howling firs, white frankincense, vanilla bean husk, tainted by droplets of blood cedar

My thoughts: I was a little leery of this one as cedar doesn‚Äôt always play well on my skin. Straight out of the imp, this was a chilly forest. Very wood heavy. On my skin it morphed into eucalyptus and motor oil with a hint of vanilla. The frankincense waves hello. Overall, just not for me. Maybe my friend will like it?

I‚Äôm currently saving up to buy an espresso machine, and after lots of research, I feel like the Argos Odyssey might be my best fit. But here‚Äôs the dilemma: if I go with the Argos, I‚Äôll probably have to wait 1-2 years to actually get my hands on it (batch production and all that). And honestly, while I can wait, I‚Äôm not sure I want to.

That‚Äôs where the Flair 58 comes in. I‚Äôm considering getting a Flair 58 and adding a pressure transducer to it. It seems like a solid option, but at the same time, the Argos has features that appeal to me‚Äîmainly the steam wand. I drink mostly straight espressos, but I do enjoy the occasional milk-based drink, and the steam wand would be nice to have for those moments.

However, one thing that keeps me hesitant about the Argos Odyssey is that it‚Äôs made by a startup company. While I‚Äôm impressed with what they‚Äôve done so far, there‚Äôs always the uncertainty of potential issues down the road. Will they be able to handle problems efficiently? What if they get overwhelmed by demand‚Äîlet‚Äôs say, more than 2,000 customers? Will they still be able to offer effective support, or will their small size limit them, even if they want to help?

On the other hand, the Flair 58 comes from an established, well-known company with a solid reputation for durability and reliability. It‚Äôs a more mature product line, and knowing that there‚Äôs a proven track record behind it gives me some peace of mind.

Right now, I‚Äôm just making pour-overs, which are great, but I really love espresso. I don‚Äôt have the money saved yet, but I‚Äôll probably be able to afford something in 2-4 months. That said, I don‚Äôt know if the current Argos batch will be sold out by then, meaning I‚Äôd be pushed to the next batch anyway.

So, I‚Äôm stuck in this loop of indecision. Do I go for the Argos and accept the wait and potential risks? Or should I grab a Flair 58 and start my espresso journey sooner with a tried-and-true option?

Any advice or personal experiences would be super helpful!

Thanks in advance!


Update: Am not going to get the argos now, I‚Äôll start with a cheaper machine until i get experienced and be able to buy some fancy machine when I graduate from college or maybe I‚Äôll stick with the cheaper one if it‚Äôs good enough ",1,1735058377.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I have the money. (I know that undercapitalization is the reason most startups fail, blah blah.) I want to start a coffee brand. Problem is either a) I roast it myself, which requires a roaster and the highly esoteric knowledge that using said roaster well requires to produce a quality product, or b) I private label from a reputable company with a track record of producing a product of marketable quality. 

But nobody wants to work with a ‚Äústartup‚Äù. I have started businesses before. I know what I‚Äôm doing on the business side of things. One of them was +$100m annually inside of five years from launch, for reference. I‚Äôm not trying to self-aggrandize here. Just establishing credibility. 

All that being said, can anyone provide some resources on how to pry the lid off this from a business aspect? I know the marketing side and how the numbers need to work, I just need to be able to produce a marketable product, but everyone I talk to is dismissive because I‚Äôm a ‚Äústartup‚Äù üòë

1hlh65r,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingStory/comments/1hlh65r/realized_5_years_later_that_i_had_unknowingly/,"Realized 5 years later that I had unknowingly been ""dating"" a guy","The other day I was chatting with my sister about how oblivious I can be, and I told her ""There was this time when a guy friend of mine kept asking me to hang out. I think he might have even had a crush on me.""

She asked ""Did you hang out with him?"" and I said ""Yea - we ate dinner together a few times, and even went to a movie once. This went on over the course of about a year."" She was like ""Oh my God. He thought you were dating.""

For me, this was a revelation. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. Eating dinner together, and going to the movies together - these are things people do on dates, right? I have taken it as a big lesson, and will be careful to never let this happen again, because I feel bad about the likely disappointment the guy felt when he realized (I think) that my intentions were purely platonic.

I'm posting this partly because I still don't know, 100%, whether the guy thought we were dating, or hoped we could date, or was being purely friendly like I was. Let me know what you think after hearing the story?

Let's call him Phil - I first met Phil at a tech conference. We randomly started chatting. He shared that he had organized the diversity scholarships for this tech conference, and I thought that was cool, and we connected on LinkedIn and I forgot about him for a couple of years.

I ended up taking a job at the same large tech company as Phil, and noticed this on LinkedIn. I wondered if I would see him around the office.

It turned out that Phil lived in my neighborhood too - I saw him on public transportation going to work. I said 'hi' and would make small talk with him on the bus once in a while. It turns out, Phil is a big fan of public transportation, and he organized an event inviting people from work to come and speak to public officials in support of public transportation. He invited me specifically, which made sense - we rode the bus together, after all.

I saw him at the event and again made small talk, and when the event ended it was about lunch time and we were in the city, far from our company's office. I don't remember who suggested it, but we got the idea of eating lunch at a nearby coffee shop and then working remotely during the afternoon. We did that - Phil and I both ate lunch and then sat and worked at the same table in this coffee shop all afternoon.

As it got to be about 5PM, Phil asked if I had dinner plans, and if I wanted to eat dinner in the area together. He had talked about being vegan, and I am vegetarian, and he mentioned knowing a good vegan/vegetarian restaurant nearby. ""Sure!"" I said.

We ate dinner at a restaurant and continued talking about our common interests - vegan/vegetarian food, programming, and public transportation. I had fun and after dinner we took the bus home.

Phil had never given me a compliment. He never tried to hold my hand or kiss me. He has never stated ""I like you"" or ""Let's go on a date"". So as far as I knew, this is all platonic stuff between coworkers who were slowly becoming friends.

At some point, a while after that, I happened to see Phil at the neighborhood supermarket while shopping. He seemed very happy to see me, and out of the blue, he asked if I wanted to eat dinner together at a neighborhood vegan restaurant. ""Sure!"" I said - why not? I liked vegan food and chatting with Phil.

Again, we ate dinner, had a fun time, and then I went home.

Some time passes - probably weeks, but I was not paying attention - and Phil would chat with me at work or on the bus once in a while. We were chatting, and he started asking what I liked to do outside of work. And - this may sound weird - the truth is that I really like programming, and that's basically most of what I do, even outside of work. Back then, I was even more focused on prorgramming, and was maintaining open source projects in addition to working \~60 hours per week on my job as a software engineer. I used to wake up on Saturday morning, grab my laptop, and go to a coffee shop and hack on open source software until the evening, and then go home and go to bed. 

Another relevant detail - I had a boyfriend at that time. So I did go on dates with my boyfriend, 1-2 evenings per week. We would go out to dinner, or go work out at the gym, or take a walk. And I knew those were dates because my boyfriend would kiss me, and give me compliments, etc. But my boyfriend was not interested in programming, and I wished I had someone to talk to about my passion for programming. I had invited a couple of friends to come hack in coffee shops with me in the past, and they either declined or didn't like it after trying it. Sooooo - 

I told Phil that I spend most of my non-work time hacking on open source projects in coffee shops, but that I wished I could find someone to hang out with while doing this. And he said right away ""I'd come hang out with you while you hack on open source projects."" I was thrilled! And again, at this point - Phil has never said ""I like you"" or ""Let's go on a date"" so this all seemed like friends hanging out to me.

Saturday came around and I met up with Phil at a coffeeshop in our neighborhood. He started trying to chat, and I politely let him know that I was trying to get some coding done, and so he stopped trying to chat with me and I started writing code. But - unfortunately - some other guy came up to me and started trying to chat with me, impeding my focus on my project. I kept trying to politely tell this other random guy that I wanted to go back to my project, but the other guy would not stop chatting at me. Phil just watched. After a couple of hours of this, I told the random guy that I had to leave, and started gathering my stuff to go. Phil came with me, and we were walking home in the same direction.

I vented a bit to Phil about how that stranger guy was preventing me from focusing on my coding, and he just listened. Then, out of the blue, Phil asked me ""Would you like to go to a bar or something?""

I was confused - and asked him ""Why would I want to do that?""

I have no memory of Phil's face or reaction, because to me, at that moment, I thought he was being confusing and I thought my response was the normal thing to say. I don't know if Phil was confused, or annoyed, or amused. I guess I was not paying attention.

He said ""Well, we could get a drink."" I replied ""Oh - I don't drink alcohol."" Then Phil said ""Well, it's also a good way to meet people.""

""Why would I want to meet people?"" I said.

...

I was asking this in a literal and friendly way - not sarcastic or anything. Like, as an introvert, I was genuinely curious why anyone would go to a crowded, noisy, smelly place and talk to strangers while getting intoxicated. That does not sound fun to me. I said something to that effect to Phil.

Phil said something like ""Don't you ever get lonely?"" and I just said ""No, not really"" and that kind of killed that thread of conversation. We got as far as my apartment, and parted ways, and I was happy to go finish my coding project stuff at home, without strangers trying to chat with me.

At that point - I still thought I was slowly becoming friends with Phil, and had not thought about it beyond that.

So then Phil messages me and says that there is a movie he thinks I would like - a documentary about volcanoes. He also mentions that one of his friends, another woman software engineer, Sarah, is going along, and that he thinks I would enjoy meeting her. And I agreed - that sounded great to me. Volcanoes are cool, and I was happy to meet another woman who likes coding. So we meet up for this movie, and I notice that his female friend is there with her husband. And that is one moment when I started to wonder - is this something romantic? And then when we sat in the theatre, I sat in between Phil and Sarah, and Sarah spent the whole movie kissing and snuggling with her husband. So I felt like that made it weird, because here I was sitting next to Phil - and did he expect kissing or snuggling?

Making matters worse, the theatre got really warm, and I had unthinkingly worn a long sleeved sweater with a tank top underneath. I started getting all sweaty, and watching the volcanoes explode on screen made me feel even warmer, and finally I took off my sweater. Phil looked over at me, and he saw that I had stripped down to a tank top, and I think his eyes widened, and I felt a bit self conscious, but at least I was not too warm any more.

With Phil's passion for public transportation, we agreed to try and get back to our own neighborhood from the theatre using the transit system, even though it would require taking two buses. Phil and I rode together, because we lived close enough to each other that it made sense, and we continued making small talk. We got close to home, but the trip was taking nearly an hour, and I was tired, so I think I suggested taking an Uber the rest of the way, and he agreed. We shared the uber ride, and that was the one moment when I wondered ""Could Phil be someone I could date?"". At that time I was looking to date someone who shared my religious beliefs, so I asked Phil ""Do you believe in God?"" and he said ""No"". ""Oh"" I said, and I mentally dropped any idea of asking him on a date.

Because, in my mind at that time, asking someone on a date meant asking ""Will you go out with me?"" like in middle school. I've realized now that it's more complicated than that, but I honestly still don't understand all the rules.

After some time, Phil asked me to hang out again, and he asked if I wanted to come play a board game at his apartment. It sounded like an interesting game, so I said ""Sure!"" and went to visit him. The board game was fun, but Phil had cats, and I'm very allergic to cats. After about an hour spent at his apartment, I started having trouble breathing. I think Phil was going to cook food for us to eat for dinner, but I had to leave, because I was losing my ability to breathe. My throat got so swollen that it made a whistling sound when I would breathe, and I was getting dizzy and could barely talk. Phil offered to walk me home, and I agreed, partly because I was afraid I would pass out. So we were walking along, and I was trying to continue breathing and get home to take some antihistamines, and Phil asked ""Can I take a selfie of us?""

""Sure"" I gasped, mainly agreeing because I didn't have the energy or voice to argue, and it seemed fastest to let him snap a photo and then get back to walking home. He took a selfie of us, and then walked me the rest of the way home.

A couple weeks later, Phil sent me a message with the selfie photo attached, asking ""What was this?""

At the time, and for years afterward, his message puzzled me. I didn't know what he meant. I replied ""That was the selfie you took from that time when I came over and played that board game with you.""

""Ok"" he responded.

He stopped asking me to hang out after that.

I think, now that I talked through this with my sister, that our last interaction was when Phil finally realized that I didn't see anything romantic in our interactions. He was trying to confirm what he had realized - that I didn't think any of our hang outs were dates. He may have hoped I would reply ""That was a selfie from our fourth date"", but when I replied with a literal description of the activity we did together that day, his fears were confirmed, and he realized I'm just the most oblivious person on the planet.

For anyone reading this and thinking ""You're either really dumb or really mean, to lead a guy on like that "" - let me just say that there are different kinds of intelligence, and on the logic side I am a 10/10. I'm a high level software engineer in my career, and I can implement and invent complex algorithms or solve tricky puzzles. But I really am totally oblivious when it comes to the people skills kind of intelligence. I've learned to use logic to become a good coworker and a good friend, and my coworkers and friends/family often say that I'm very kind. But I often can't read people, and I continue to learn ways in which this can lead to problems. So I was not leading him on, I feel bad about what happened, and hopefully it was all no big deal to him. Or maybe I'm wrong, and he also just thought we were friends the whole time.

They work together so they were pregnant with me and my friend at the same time, 21 years ago and our older sisters 24 years ago. So they invited us to this trip and we drove up with them like 10 hours away and stayed with them in an Airbnb. 

My friends dad was either drunk or high the whole time and being weirdly flirty with me and just not understanding me saying no and getting uncomfy. His literal wife and daughters were there with me and him. But it kept escalating enough that another family friend who met us there left the bar early because he was so uncomfortable with the comments this dad made about me while I wasn't around.

We went to a few bars and he was trying to get my mom to leave me with him and go back to the Airbnb, and thank God she didn't leave. Then when I thought the group was following us out, me and him walked out of the bar and he fully escalated and pushed me against the wall, touching my butt and pulling me in and doing horrifically cringy growls at me, continuing to say how hot and sexy he thinks I am. I was drunk and emotional always already so I threw a fit and his daughter and my mom came out from the bar and the daughter immediately blamed me for ruining this trip, being overdramatic and that I'm ungrateful for this trip. I was ready to play off his advances all night bc I work in a bar and I'm used to creepy old guys hitting on me but when he got physical I flipped TF out.

I didn't want to ride in an Uber back with him obviously so I didn't get in and they fucking left me and my mom on the street drunk in a strange city with our phones almost dead at 3am and we didn't have the Airbnb address so it was a fiasco. 

Eventually we got back to the shared Airbnb and I just wanted to be left alone and cry but his wife and daughter come down and yell at me for ruining the trip being dramatic and accusing him of such horrible things (which he did just SA me there). They were saying he always touches his daughters butts and it's completely normal and I'm being crazy over nothing. I got my boyfriend 22m on the phone and I had told him the situation as it went down and he agreed that it's literally SA and the wife is victim blaming and they all yelled at each other over speakerphone. She blamed it on his cancer and chemo changing him while barely mentioning his alcoholism. She mentioned how she overheard me in the summer JOKING about how this dad was the hottest of my friends dads. She tried to used that as proof that I'm into him and I wanted it. And the way the daughter and wife kept saying he's always touchy like that with them and normalizing it grossed me out and made me feel like they've said this script before.
The wife is a high school guidance counselor too so it was really disappointing to see her defend her SAer husband and call me names so adamantly.

Next morning they tried to apologize but were still blaming me and they tried to pay for tickets but we already got some because this was day 2 of this week long trip. We got tf out of there. Crazy that our families have been friends for 30 years and this 55 year old man would go after a girl only 2 weeks older than their daughter WHO WAS THERE. 

Days later after they got back from the rest of their trip and I was still distraught and recovering, the daughter my age went to a hometown party to try and get ahead of the story trying to say her dad isn't a pedo bc I'm 21 (she is also 21) and honestly I'm glad I didn't go to that party bc it's really a bummer at a party to sit everyone down to explain why your dad isn't a pedo, but not denying that he did SA me. 

How do you think I should deal with this, ngl I wasn't even gonna say anything to the whole friend group but because she got to it first I want to set the story straight. The wife kicked him out to live in his art studio when they got back from the trip but how do I punish him?? Should I ruin his career?! He sold a coffee table to Joe Rogan so should I go that route??

I want to let the indirect sun light in for our house plants, and I also enjoy looking out of the windows and seeing the world. 

Immediately after my wife gets up, she closes the windows because she thinks the sun's UV rays will age her skin. 

I understand direct sunlight can be harmful but our apartment only has west facing windows, so we don't get any direct sunlight until the afternoon.

I believe it is healthier to keep the windows open and to be exposed to indirect sunlight throughout the day than sitting in the dark or turning on the house lights with the curtains shut. She believes any sunlight, even indirect sunlight is bad for her skin and will age. 

She also uses an umbrella to block UV rays anytime we are outside, even if it's overcast, or we're only 20 steps from the car to the grocery store.  She will also wear heavy clothing while we're driving in the car to block UV rays despite my windows being tinted with a specific film to block UV rays. Then she will want to turn on the air because she's too hot but won't take her coat and scarf off.

Every time I try to talk to her about the health benefits of getting vitamin D from the sun she shuts down. Any time I try to discuss having a healthier relationship with the sun she just gets quiet and won't talk to me. 

I know how sensitive of a subject it is so I try to talk to her calmly and rationally from time to time but then she always closes me out and shuts down the conversation. 

Am I the asshole for thinking her relationship with the sun is unhealthy and trying to get her to ease up? Should I just accept that we live like Dracula? Or is this unhealthy?

Context: FWB 10 years and in a committed relationship / cohabitating for 4.

He is an exceptionally talented but out of work actor. He doesn‚Äôt have financial means so I asked him to make me a gift by restitching my leather battle jacket patches and spikes so it looked better! 

This endeavour would take time, probably something like 8-10 hours. He had time. 

Meanwhile, I bought gifts for my son (his step son) all his nieces and nephews (4) his mom, dad, brother, sister and him. 

I baked and cooked, did all that stuff.

We promised not to fight on Xmas because usually I get resentful from pulling most of the weight, say something about it, and then he reacts in a self hating way. 

So that‚Äôs the pattern.

Now it‚Äôs the day before Xmas and I wake up, he hasn‚Äôt had coffee yet. He‚Äôs making breakfast for himself and I say 

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the jacket coming?‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt have any gifts under the tree. 

He says ‚Äúit will take many more hours and won‚Äôt be done in time, you won‚Äôt wear it right away anyways‚Äù

And when I mention the 20+ hours he put into video games in the last week I ‚Äúruined his Christmas‚Äù and now he refuses to participate in family photos and his pissy mood is permeating throughout the house.

He is working on the jacket now, but has doubled down on the fact that I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care about him‚Äù etc. 

Am I the asshole for breaking the no fights rule and being resentful / unable to contain my disappointment?

1hlgx0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1hlgx0j/quining_qualia_daniel_dennett_why_this/,Quining Qualia - Daniel Dennett. Why this Philosopher is Denying the Existence of Qualia?,"I got a read onto the Daniel Dennett article's and watched several videos to get an understanding of it. 

If I understand correctly, then qualia are the perceptual and sensitive states of an individual. Those states answer to question ""What do I feel?"". For example, if I put my hand into the warm water, my receptors will say ""Don't you dare to put your hand into the warm water."", because I will feel PAIN. I think that this definition is suggesting that to acces qualia, you must have something intermediary. In that case, a possible intermediary shall be the body (more specifically the receptors itselves, which send stimuli to the brain, which does whatever it does to tell ""this is PAIN"") and memory (""I can remember that, in the past, I put my hand in a warm water, and I feel pain""). Still, Dennett is denying qualia, but I don't understand why. 

Let's get to one of his *intuition pumps* about Chase and Sanborn. This guys were employees for ten years in a coffee shop. The last time they tasted the coffee, they observed something changed.  
1. Because of his change of receptors, Chase feels a different taste for the coffee, which is worse than before.   
2. Sanborn, on the other hand, lost his memories. He doesn't remember how the taste of the first drinked coffee had been. Something is slightly of with the coffee that he had tasted.

So, from what I understand here, Dennett is trying to say that qualia is changing. I think he is right, because qualia comes into many different forms, which can make the problem more complicated. But, this still doesn't refute the existence of qualia. What changed had Chase and Sanborn experienced is for the intermediary, but not for qualia. Chase changed his receptors and Sanborn changed his memory, so they get a different qualia

She really likes vintage modern stuff.  It‚Äôs started with little things like nice china, jewelry, smaller retro items etc.   Since then it‚Äôs escalated into larger and larger purchases.   We used to have room in our basement for our kids to run around in but now it‚Äôs a not possible because of the numerous dinner tables, dressers, coffee tables bookshelves, chairs, dinnerware sets and numerous other purchases she‚Äôs made.  Her plan for the larger items is she wants to refinish them and bring them back to life.   But she never does any of this.   If she does attempt to actually go through with it she‚Äôll work on it for 1-2 days and then it just goes back to sitting there.   The last time she tried redoing anything was literally years ago and the half finished footrest is still sitting in the same spot she left it.   This stuff just sits down there for years and years with no real purpose.  

Now of course she does not want to get rid of any of it. She‚Äôs one of the most stubborn people I‚Äôve ever met.   I‚Äôm also pretty stubborn so I‚Äôm not tying to make her look bad, but you know how stubborn people are.   I don‚Äôt even approach the topic any longer because I know conversations will go nowhere.  She does not like getting rid of anything she has.  It makes me very angry because I‚Äôm a stay at home dad and it‚Äôs my job to try and keep the house clean but I can‚Äôt really do anything for our once habitable basement.   

I‚Äôm not sure what to do anymore.  At this rate we‚Äôre not going to have any room in our basement because it‚Äôs going to be filled with what I consider worthless junk.     Its one of those things where she finds these things for so cheap that I can‚Äôt really be mad that she‚Äôs spending money on it and it really is the only hobby she has (other than watching tv and looking at her phone at the same time).   

Part of me wants to just start taking a piece here and a piece there back to goodwill.   I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd really notice but that also seems like an asshole move.   

Anybody have any recommendations?   It‚Äôs not a serious issue where I‚Äôd end our relationship over.   I also don‚Äôt like having our basement be a junk storage facility.

1hlgrho,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1hlgrho/today_is_5_months_clean_and_sober/,"Today is 5 months, clean and sober!!!","Today is 5 months, I can't believe it. I've been thinking about what I was going to write for about a week now, and I am BLOWN away how much my life has changed in the last 4 to 6 weeks. The gratitude I have is hard to put into words. 

I just checked in with my doctor last week I've lost 32 pounds, and holding steady. I've gotten a job, and it's been amazing. I haven't coded in YEARS, didn't even think I could anymore, and my focus, attention span, concentration have not been this good in I cannot even remember when. My depression and anxiety are way down, way way down. I have more energy, I have gotten my house, car, any space I occupy, spotlessly clean. I went from living in filth to I've literally run out of things to clean. I've taken up candle making in the past few weeks. I like smelling nice things now. Since I've quit smoking, and I can smell again, oh man, I love good smelling things now. Went decades without really being able to smell. I was on the verge of being homeless, couldn't eat cause I did not have the money, being without a job, would not recommend. These last several weeks, I have been BLESSED with food, people giving me food. I hate wasting food, so I've been donating anything and everything I could. I've gone from famine to a life I cannot believe. 

I now have 3 people who have come to me for 'guidance', 'how did you do it'. One I've known for 20 years, and the other 2 for about 3 years now. They don't know each other, and they have all told me the same thing, OP, you inspire me, you give me hope. One is almost a month sober now, one is 7 weeks in without a cigarette after 29 years of smoking, and one attempted suicide 8 weeks ago. First, she's in outpatient treatment, I am NO professional, we meet for coffee and talk. I listen to them, and they ask me how I did it. How did you change? I am humbled as all get out, humbled, like shocked, tears in my eyes, why would you look to me?

If I, me, could have somehow told myself 6 months ago, this is where I would be in life, but to me even more importantly, how I would feel on the inside, think, energy, lot less anxiety and depression I would NOT have believed it, not even from me. Without a woman, or drugs or something, or all the above, lots of it?

I love this sub, been a huge help. I am ONLY 5 months clean and sober, I don't even pretend to know anything. I just know what my experience has been. I am just another bozo on the bus. If the miracle has not happened for you yet, don't quit, don't give up, keep moving forward, no matter what. If you're thinking about quitting and have made it this far, think about why you got started in the first place. You're already in pain, get a reward from it!

  
I wake up now with gratitude, that I didn't kill myself. I have no clue what is BEST for me, so I am not even remotely qualified to say anything about anyone else.

I tend to drink light to medium roasted coffees for pour over. I am wondering after reading through countless posts here about hand grinders everyone loves, if it is worth it to upgrade my burrs on this grinder, and if the cost is going to bring noticeably better flavor out of my cups. I know a lot of people hate this grinder, but I have no qualms with it (although I am on a waitlist for Zerno and have considered the Philos as well). I do not love the act of hand grinding with my daily routine, but I am not 100% against it either (but would prefer it more as a secondary option and not my main pour over grinder). I get beans from a variety of places, but mostly Black & White Roasters, occasionally Onyx as well as a new start up in the area I live in that gets their green beans from the same sources as B&W. 

  
I know a lot of people also love the Ode 2 for pour over as well, but doesn't seem like it is a step up from what I have currently (a friend has it and it is great, but I wouldn't say better). 

TLDR - is there a Burr I should try to upgrade my DF64 is the juice not worth the squeeze as they say. Merry Christmas Eve all
