I need some advice/tips.
I‚Äôm a 27 year old single mom to a very active 3 year old. I struggle with low energy. It‚Äôs horrible. I have been to docs and have to get some blood work done. I definitely think it‚Äôs PCOS or something with my thyroid. I‚Äôve been gaining weight ‚Ä¶I either have a phase where I don‚Äôt eat enough calories or I binge eat at night. Weight loss meds are my last option. I really don‚Äôt want to want. I want to be able to do this on my own naturally. I need new healthy habits. The winter sucks for me I hate the cold. I have arthritis from Lyme disease so my joints hurt bad in the winter. I know exercise can help but my energy is HORRIBLE. Coffee/caffeine makes me tweak and feel sick. My vitamin D levels are definitely low. I have no idea what I should take or how much I should take. So let me know what supplements/vitamins you take that seem helpful or any exercise routines ",1,1734019808.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

I have the shims in my grinder, for what it's worth. I typically make two shots every morning and another form of coffee, sometimes French Press or cold brew, sometimes two more shots. One of the two is for my partner, I'm not a fiend. 

The problem I have is that I'll dose grind, 15.3g, at 3E, and pull the first shot and it'll pull at 40 seconds. Then I'll grind 15.3g of the same bean, from the same bag, measured on the same scale, at 3E, and the second shot will pull at 33 seconds. It'll also taste different. And I don't think there's any consistency in which pull longer or shorter.

Is there an obvious cause for this that I'm not seeing because it's too close to me, or because I've just come to the conclusion that this is what espresso is like?

I visited different countries both developing and developed ones. There's a major difference I noticed between the two groups of countries which is how people from a certain country will interact with you and interfere with your privacy.

In Tunisia, as well as in any other still developing country I visited, the people tend to be talkative and over-social to the point being nosy. You meet a stranger (even in countries where they can't tell you are a foreigner like being in an Arab country or Latin American country) and they initiate a conversation with you for no reason, they want to know everything about you, giving you suggestion and advice even you didn't ask for that. 

The simplest example is sitting in a coffee shop, where even the waiter will be nosy. As a waiter why would you ask me where am I coming from, what I'm doing for living, why am I sitting alone, why are you telling me a joke?! I'm a book worm and I like sometimes going to a coffee shop to sit alone and read. In Tunisia and as well other countries from the developing world I visited I almost never felt comfortable. First there will be many people watching me as if I'm an alien! It's a weird picture for them to see a young man sitting alone and reading a book! Plus they surpass that to becoming nosy by talking with me while we don't know each other, and there is no necessity situation that needs a conversation to be initiated in the first place like asking for lighter for example! They just wanna talk, and they talk about everything. Out of the blue they will be telling you their opinion about any subject that you didn't ask about and without knowing who you are or your background, and also giving you advice that you didn't ask about as well! (Sometimes I found a total stranger telling me 100% wrong info about my professional expertise, and he would be confident although he is a total ignorant, be he is not aware as he doesn't know anything about me)

In contrast, whenever I'm in the country where I'm living or another developed country I visit, I can go anywhere I want, to any coffee shop I want, I place my order, I sit in my table, I drink my coffee and ready my book peacefully, and no one single person will bother me in any way. Except necessary interactions, like someone asking me if a chair in my table is vacant for example.

I know we are culturally different and I know this is part of who we are as Tunisians, but Subahn Allah lwe7d sometimes want to just sit alone and enjoy the company of himself.

P.S I'm talking about just one attribute that annoys me a lot. There are many other attributes that make the difference between developing and developed countries, and both groups have their own bad and good attributes.",1,1734019595.0,Tunisia,1,1.0,False

Actually sat in Starbucks with the line manager for the role and we had a great chat (I think).

We adopted Harvey 2 weeks ago and accordingly to his foster he was a calm, friendly boy, and was able to be left alone for 3-4 hrs. For context, he was rescued around 4 weeks old with his whole litter and his mom. So he was used to being around dogs, going on walks with them. He was the last of the litter to get adopted so he did slowly lose all his siblings plus his mom. His mom did show some signs of being reactive so he did see that behaviour. Most of his siblings were adopted into houses with other dogs and all seem to be doing well. 

Harvey is incredibly anxious and is slowly coming out of his shell. He now has started showing more puppy tendencies like wanting to play, interest in toys, have zoomies! We went from not being able to get him off our front lawn to now being able to go around the block for a walk. However, he‚Äôs incredibly anxious on our walks, with his tail mostly tucked. We do live in the city so cars, streetcars, bikes are everywhere and he‚Äôs slowly getting used to them. 

The main issue for him is dogs. Anytime we see a dog, he starts barking and sometimes lunging and growling. We are trying positive reinforcement and doing our best to remove him out of his trigger zone. When he‚Äôs calm and just observing dogs, we immediately mark with the command yes and give him high value treats. We also have hired a reactivity trainer. The 2 times he has gotten nose to nose with a dog (on leash) he was calm and switched to tail wagging and let the dog sniff him and would sniff the dog back. We kept the interactions short and left them on his positive note. But then on walks it‚Äôs back to scary barking, and I‚Äôm too scared to take him to a park or let him approach a dog in case he does snap. To me, the barking seems to be more to scare the other dog off because he himself is scared and not necessarily aggressive but I don‚Äôt want to risk it. We live in an incredibly dog busy neighbourhood where 90% of our neighbours have dogs so it‚Äôs really hard to go out and not see a dog. All the dogs are very social or dog neutral so we definitely stand out with a loud barking puppy. I try to keep my anxiety at bay and try to be relaxed so he picks up on that energy but I really hate taking him out on walks and having to fear if we‚Äôre going to see a dog. 

He‚Äôs totally fine with people, a little hesitant if someone comes over to us on leash but with a slow approach is happy to get pets from both adults and kids. We have had visitors over to our place and and he is great with all visitors. 

With us he‚Äôs super cuddly and sweet and is starting to get better at being left alone but still shows signs of separation anxiety. 

We adopted him on the context that he was dog social, okay with people and being alone. And only the people thing seems to be accurate so far. I followed up with the rescue and they told me I was being impatient and kind of blamed me for wanting my dog to be social and not adjusting myself to his needs. But realistically I want a dog that I can integrate into my neighbourhood and take to coffee shops, patios and walk with my friends dogs and I‚Äôm worried he might not be that dog. 

Harvey is going to be a big boy, over 120 lbs and as a 100lb Female, the thought of having a massive reactive dog in the city terrifies me! He‚Äôs incredibly sweet to us but I am having serious regrets about getting him and go back and forth on the idea of returning him.

In any case, let me share my story.

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: TÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his nerdy quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.


So if you're a fellow lover of coffee, learning, and all things nerdy, this tall drink of water might just be the partner in crime you've been looking for. Dating at times feel like a job hunt doesn't it? So I thought it‚Äôd be fun to write it in a mock format just like a resume! LOL

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into business and investments, frustrated law student, can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck (sarcasm towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha).

- I'm 5'10"", physically fit, resides in quezon city. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and hygienic

- I'm an INTJ, Aries, if you‚Äôre into MBTI and believes in horoscope.

- Loves to read self-help books as I love to learn and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Here's a list of my favorites:
Movies/Series | Music | Places | Activities | Books

Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday
Sherlock | Eraserheads | Coffee Shops | Painting | How to Win Friends & Influence People

##Pros:

- Respo≈Üsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism.

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts resp√≤nsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

Sustainable Coffee Revolution: NEXE Innovations Partners with Bridgehead Coffee for a Greener Future

https://preview.redd.it/7qrahct9wf6e1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b19cfb79d25dbec9a340f296994228088c85c842

NEXE Innovations Inc. (TSXV: NEXE), a trailblazer in compostable materials and sustainable packaging, has announced a landmark multi-year master manufacturing agreement with Bridgehead Coffee, a Canadian coffee brand synonymous with quality and Fairtrade practices. This partnership solidifies the synergy between two environmentally focused organizations dedicated to redefining coffee experiences while reducing environmental impact.

This new agreement follows NEXE‚Äôs successful second delivery of BPI-certified compostable coffee pods to Bridgehead, showcasing the compatibility of innovation and sustainability. The collaboration underpins both companies‚Äô commitment to green solutions and positions them as leaders in a rapidly evolving market.

**Scaling Sustainable Innovation with Confidence**

‚ÄúThis agreement underscores the growing demand for sustainable solutions in the coffee industry,‚Äù stated Ash Guglani, President of NEXE Innovations. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud to enhance our partnership with Bridgehead Coffee, enabling us to scale effectively and drive growth with both existing and future customers.‚Äù

With this multi-year commitment, NEXE strengthens its foothold in the competitive coffee industry, leveraging its patented technology to deliver high-quality, eco-friendly products. The company's innovative coffee pods are fully compostable and designed for enhanced flavor extraction, making them a superior alternative to traditional plastic pods.

**Revolutionizing Coffee Pods with Patented Technology**

One of the standout features of NEXE's compostable pods is their unique filter design, protected by U.S. Patent No. 12,004,678, issued in June 2024. This innovation expands the filter area, allowing for greater coffee volume per pod and improved flavor profiles. Bridgehead, which transitioned from soft-bottom compostable pods to NEXE's advanced design, exemplifies the shift toward environmentally conscious yet quality-driven coffee solutions.

These pods are compatible with major brewing machines, offering consumers a seamless switch to sustainable products without compromising convenience or taste.

**Bridgehead Coffee: A Legacy of Quality and Ethics**

Bridgehead Coffee, with over 40 years of history, has been a pioneer in bringing Fairtrade coffee to Canada. Operating 17 coffeehouses across Ontario, Bridgehead is also a recognized wholesale partner, supplying major retailers like Costco, Whole Foods Market, and Farm Boy. This collaboration with NEXE Innovations aligns seamlessly with Bridgehead‚Äôs dedication to sustainability and its goal to provide exceptional coffee experiences.

Currently, Bridgehead offers two popular SKUs, Centro House and Bytown Boom, which are available at select Farm Boy locations and via their website. The addition of NEXE‚Äôs compostable pods further diversifies their offerings, strengthening their appeal to eco-conscious customers.

**Why This Partnership Matters**

The coffee industry has long grappled with waste generated by single-use pods. NEXE Innovations and Bridgehead Coffee are proving that sustainability and quality can coexist, offering a blueprint for other businesses aiming to align with green practices. By investing in compostable materials and scalable solutions, both companies are not only driving growth but also inspiring change in consumer habits and corporate responsibility.

**Conclusion**

NEXE Innovations‚Äô partnership with Bridgehead Coffee marks a significant milestone in the journey toward a greener future for the coffee industry. This collaboration serves as a testament to the power of innovation and shared values in addressing pressing environmental challenges.",1,1734018849.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been crying my eyes out in the office today. And it wasn‚Äôt the first time. 

The thing is I‚Äòm a people pleaser. With Asperger‚Äòs. And I‚Äòm always the stupid one in the end. 

My colleague and I had a mutual agreement to give each other warnings via What‚ÄôsApp whenever the boss or his vice are pissed at one of us. Oral of course, nothing written. MUTUAL agreement with the principle of not telling anybody else of it. Or so I thought. It was her idea. 

But today she threw me under the bus. Here‚Äôs what happened: She took the day off yesterday. In the evening I wrote to her, we had an inconvenience in the office that concerned her. Nothing too serious, but like a ‚Äûjust be prepared for a talk tomorrow.‚Äú She thanked me. But in the morning another colleague told me the vice was pissed at my colleague for taking the day off yesterday and that and I quote ‚Äûhe‚Äôs gonna be loud with her today. I frankly hope she‚Äôs not coming.‚Äú For better understanding: The boss is off work for a few days. My inner alarm clocks immediately startet going off and I was like ‚ÄûOMG he‚Äôs gonna yell at her! I need to IMMEDIATELY warn her!‚Äú 

Guess what happened? The colleague came in completely stressed and asked the vice what the problem is? Of course she told him that I had texted her and who got asked ‚ÄûWhy are you spreading rumors?‚Äú Me! To which I brought up our agreement. Colleague said nothing to that. She just thought I had fed her a lie. 

It feels weird to say that, but it‚Äôs a good thing that I spilled my morning coffee over my keyboard prior to this shit. That way I could stay in my single office all work day and basically just deep clean and cry. Bonus point: The colleague that told me about the vice being pissed brought me cookies and helped with the keyboard cleaning. 

We‚Äòll see about the bosse‚Äòs reaction to all of this shit. My colleague and I already had disputes last week and on Monday because of my I gotta admit poor communication skills (I quite often leave out details assuming them as self-explanatory, generally known, etc.). Last week it got me so stressed I had to stay home with migraine the next day. Mum and boyfriend already said I should start looking for a job without teamwork. I guess they have a point.

One time in the psych ward‚Ä¶

Well - I always hated milk n in the wards I‚Äôve been to they give
U a milk and Juice cup w/ each meal and that‚Äôs it for liquids (decaf coffee at night with a snack too)

So.. I hate milk lol and refused to drink it. & I was so far into my psychosis I didn‚Äôt even notice a drinking fountain for the patients in the day room. 

So idk how many days passed where I wasn‚Äôt drinking fluids cos I hate milk, n maybe drank some juice cups, and didn‚Äôt even notice the drinking fountain 

This was in 2010-2013 (those years blur for me) I vividly recall my heart beat waking me up. 
It was loud and thumped and woke me up from a seroquel daze. I never felt like
This in my life 

I stumbled to the first person I could find, drugged up and in a daze, dizzy and faint & I told her 

‚ÄúI think I am having a heart attack.‚Äù

They got me to a paramedic who took my vitals and established I was dehydrated 

From the ward, they took me in an ambulance to the ER at 4 in the morning to hook me up to an IV of fluids
I was beyond scared, paranoid and didn‚Äôt understand what was going on (psychosis from trauma) 
The worker from the ward tho rode w/ me and I asked him to hold my hand- so for the next hour or so i sat there confused and scared crying and in pain holding a strangers hand thinking I was gonna die 
ALL BECAUSE I HATE MILK

Anyway ..they get me back to the ward n show me The water fountain, give me a cup and direct me to hydrate

In this outing of more cards, we will take a look at accessory cards. Some of the cards mentioned in other outings will be listed as REF. to provide relevant context.

Though accessory cards should be joined by eco cards, I will separate eco cards into the next post instead, wrapping up the more card series with the Vendor system and foods.

# ACCESSORY CHANGES

**STUN GUN**

* Using Stun Gun to breakfree also negates the stoppable, gradual trauma as if you just received normal health healing.
   * For reference about gradual trauma, check this \[[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Back4Blood/comments/1h9fbqw)\] about healing/trauma cards.
* **Stun Gun can be proactively** used to stun Mutations (but not bosses by default). I don't have a suggestion on how far this range should be.
* In additional to the reuse mechanic, each instance of Stun Gun has 1/1/2/2 charges (ammo). Reusing a Stun Gun causes the given usage to not consume a charge.
* Stun Gun re-use chance is still 0/10/20/30%.

**BAIT JAR**

* The direct impact deals 20/40/60/80 toxic damage and debuffs the target for 8/12/16/20s.
* Bait Jar impact debuff causes 20/30/40/50% MS slow and taunts other enemies to attack the target.
* The splash deals 0/0/0/0 toxic damage in a 1/2/3/4m radius and debuffs surrounding enemies for 4/6/8/10s.
* Bait Jar splash debuff causes 10/15/20/25% MS slow and taunts other enemies to attack them on a lower priority than the impacted target.
* The baiting AoE will continously attract (aggro) lesser enemies to move towards it and melee against it, which can cause other enemies to be damaged by those melee.
* **The baiting AoE lifetime will advance by 0.15s for each melee taken from a Ridden**. This is to basically make Bait Jar not being a straight upgrade from Fire Crackers.
* Baiting AoE lifetime from 5/6/7/8s to 6/9/12/15s.

**FIRECRACKER**

* Base duration from 4/6/8/10s to 6/9/12/15s.
* **50% of the Riddens distracted by a Firecracker will bump up their mobility by a notch or gain +20% speed if blitzing already**.
* Mobility notches: 1) normal, 2) jogging, 3) running, 4) sprinting, 5) blitzing.
* Alerted (aggro'd) blitzing enemies are immune to Firecracker distraction.

**PIPE BOMB**

* **25% of the Riddens distracted by a Firecracker will bump up their mobility by a notch or gain +20% speed if blitzing already**.
* Alerted (aggro'd) Blitzing enemies are immune to Pipe Bomb distraction.

# NEW ITEMS

To avoid TMI in too little time, new items are to be introduced at the bottom of this post.

====

Note that the content of each card may seem stuffed; It's because each card is designed to pack a similar¬†*weight*¬†to Glass Cannon

Having a card system where the deck is more potent on a per card basis is beneficial in two major ways:

1. The level can be littered with less card shrines.
2. When it comes to PvP, it would only take a simple downsizing to several cards (5-6) for the system to remain functionable as there won't be nearly as much opportunity for having cards or looting new ones over; but with each card being potent at a modertely high extent, even a handful of cards are enough for each player to assume a playstyle.

1hcnwfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1hcnwfy/tipping_war_the_long_game/,Tipping War ‚Äì The Long Game,"Picture two categories of people:

1) Older people who grew up with tipping only being expected at full-service restaurants and a few other specific instances

2) Younger people who think that tipping for things like coffee, ice cream, sandwiches, fast-casual dining, theater concessions, etc., is the norm.

Setting aside the fact that there's some crossover (some older people who accept the change in tipping culture, and some younger people who resist it), it's pretty safe to say that as time progresses, and if these businesses hold the line, there will be fewer of #1, and more of #2.  There will be less resentment of being asked for tips, and more people just reflexively hitting the 20% button by default.

Perhaps economics can somehow influence the outcome.  For instance, if Restaurant A prompts me for a tip, but Restaurant B does not, I'm going to be more likely to patronize Restaurant B.  If enough other people feel this way too, maybe Restaurant A will eventually have a reckoning with its declining sales and pinpoint the blame on customers being annoyed at the tipping expectation.

But I don't know if the number of people who are vehemently against the drastic expansion of tipping culture is enough to reach a true critical mass in terms of backlash against these businesses, and in many cases, there are really no ""non-tipping"" alternatives... pretty much every coffee, ice cream, fast casual, and sandwich place indulges in the dreaded ""the pad is going to ask you a question"" thing.

There are some I've loved of course - for anime, I hold stuff like Cowboy Bebop, Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist etc in very high regard, and there have been a couple of JRPGs I've enjoyed, like the OG FF7 and Yakuza Like a Dragon. For the most part though, they're not really something I go out of my way to play or experience.

But P5R honestly changed all of that. I bought the game on a whim because I was in the mood for something turn-based after beating XCOM 2 on my Steam Deck and a lot of people recommended it as a great handheld experience. I didn't have super-high expectations one way or another because of my personal preferences, even though I was aware of the game's reputation and critical acclaim.

Well I'm about 60 hours in now and I can safely say that I absolutely fucking LOVE this game. Hell, I would actually put it in my top 10 all-time favourite games list at this point. And the main reason for that is also something very unexpected - the ability to live the boring, mundane life of a Japanese high-school kid. 

P5R is, I think, the ultimate ""vibes"" game I've ever played. The mood and atmosphere it creates with the music and non-combat setting is just incredible. I thought I'd just be looking forward to the combat sections and run through the social sim stuff as fast as possible, but honestly it's been the opposite. Not that I don't love the combat - it's really damn fun, super smooth and polished, with the perfect balance of accessibility and challenge for a JRPG noob like myself. But really it's the social sim non-combat parts that elevate the game to another level for me.

There's just something so cozy and comforting about wandering around Yongen-Jaya at night or in the rain, as ""Beneath the Mask"" plays in the background, or chilling in Leblanc and making some coffee and shooting the shit with Sojiro. I love hanging out with my friends, going to a beef bowl shop or the park or billiards. Or spending an afternoon studying in the school library. Or just walking down Shibuya and Kichijoji buying random shit.

I've traveled to Japan 3 times, and Tokyo remains my favourite city in the world. So it's an absolute joy to be able to explore it digitally, and just be able to experience the atmosphere of the city when I miss it too much lol. 

It just feels really good to go through the ordeal of beating the Palaces, and then spending the next few days relaxing and chilling. I love how the game's structure almost feels like a TV show, with each Palace and change of heart being a new season. It's also crazy that even after 40+ hours, the game kept introducing new mechanics and new things to do! 

Not to mention the technical aspects of the game, which are brilliant. The music is obviously top-tier but I also love the general visual design and UI. I don't think I've ever seen menus that are so...*fun* to navigate in any other game. Every visual aspect of the game is just dripping with style and pizazz. 

I haven't been so immersed in a game for a very long time. From what I've read, I still have at least 50-60 hours more to go, which is honestly excellent news.",10,1734018077.0,Persona5,1,1.0,False
1hcntjk,https://i.redd.it/v6sy8msztf6e1.jpeg,I‚Äôm scared ,"Hey everyone,

TW: This is a somewhat negative post. If you‚Äôre feeling mentally unwell please skip, I don‚Äôt want to upset other patients. 



So I caught Covid for the third time a few weeks ago and took my time to aggressively rest to prevent another crash. 

This Sunday we went for a walk with my husband to enjoy the autumn leaves and I climbed uphill a few times during the walk (mentioning this because walking uphill has proved to be a major PEM trigger for me)

Then immediately on Sunday night I started having chills and exhaustion. I spend the following couple of days (Monday and Tuesday) staying home. Yesterday tho.. We decided to go out for tea with my husband. I was a bit tired but I didn‚Äôt have the ‚Äúlightheadedness / chest pain / a force is constraining my chest and pushing me down feeling‚Äù that usually happens on the days I choose the stay home. I took a shower, styled my hair and put on some light makeup (so I wasn‚Äôt feeling too bad at the beginning of the evening) and stepped out. 

On our way to the coffee shop I started to feel ‚Äúair hunger‚Äù and had trouble breathing a full round of air into my lungs. Then I made the mistake of climbing the stairs and getting seated on the second floor. That just escalated the air hunger to another level. Big mistake. We sat down for coffee and tea (didn‚Äôt order anything unusual so no risk of developing allergies) and my air hunger kept bothering me. I noticed my husband keeping an eye on me so I realized this is not going to end well. 

And then the following happened. It was a haze so I‚Äôll write down what I remember:

- I get so tired that I can‚Äôt see anymore and everything is a blurry mess

- Can‚Äôt keep my tea in my hand 

- Napkin falls down from my hand 

- I pass out for a short time, collapse on my chair then wake up

- Sounds and bright lights are too much to comprehend by my brain 

- I want to speak, but I *can‚Äôt*. This was the scariest part. I‚Äôve had brain fog before in 2023 after my initial Covid infection, it felt like I couldn‚Äôt reach my words but I could still put together basic sentences. This time, I lost my ability to talk. I couldn‚Äôt talk. 

- I could hear my husband and understand some of what he said. I reached my hand and squeezed his hand to signal I understand him but can‚Äôt reply back verbally. He quickly understood I was trying to communicate. I was having body tremors at this point and my lips were shaking. 

- This lasted for about half an hour. Then the blurriness of my vision disappeared, I could read the letters on the teabag and verbally communicate with my husband. 

- We came back home in a taxi. I had to lay down in our dark bedroom with a black fabric on my eyes to cut off the light, but I continue to shiver for another hour. 

- My hands and forearms turn purplish red as seen in the picture. This happens to me during summer when the hot and humid weather triggers my symptoms and last time it happened this bad was when I lost a lot of water during a colonoscopy. 

 Today, I‚Äôm not close to passing out, I can talk and walk around the house a bit. I was able to vacuum, change the litter box, do my skincare, prepare quick meals and do a couple rounds of laundry. But with long breaks of laying down in between. 

I have been diagnosed with long Covid and ME/CFS last year at a long Covid clinic in Japan and mine is a dynamic case. I go from periods of almost being bedridden after Covid infections to gradually being housebound and having a more normalish life eventually, until the next Covid infection halts my recovery. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π But not being able to speak was a first for me.

At that point it was my duty as a husband to stand by her. For better or for worse right? Anyway, within two years of our marriage I landed a high paying job at a law firm. Three years later I became an partner at the firm. I decided to surprise my wife and upgrade her wedding ring. I had no idea her initial response, but given the fact that we have been together for a while I thought about her and I wanted to use my bonus to spoil her.
Anyway fast forward to the day I went to pick her up from work.
She was a bit tired but I thought this was normal.
I was standing outside with flowers, her favorite chocolate and the fanciest suit I could wear.
She looks at me in surprise asking what am I doing here.
I opened the door and asked her to get in.
She seemed annoyed but she got in anyway.
Driving off I asked how was her day and she snaps at me.
She then asked why did I come up to her job and explains that I have embarrassed her.
I was taken aback.
Embarrassed her?
I came in a $1000 suit with all the goodies and I have embarrassed her?
How was this possible?
I asked where was this coming from and she suddenly turns and looks out the window.
I say nothing else as I pull into her favorite restaurant.
She looks at me with a look of disgust like I just insulted her great ancestors.
She said that she doesn't want to be here and to take her home.
I tried to reason with her but she wasn't hearing it.
I pulled out the final card while driving home.
I reached into my suit pocket and hand her the box that contained the wing.
She slowly rolls down the window and throws the box out.
I completely lost it.
I asked her did she know what she just did?
She said she threw a box out the window so what was the problem.
I told her first of all that's littering which is a crime and Secondly I just bought her an upgraded wedding ring.
She said that she doesn't need another ring and she really doesn't need me if she is being honest.
I was shocked.
Not only did I spend $10,000 on this ring but I had paid an additional $2,000 to have our names and the date we started our relationship engraved in the inside of the ring.
So a total of $12,000 gone just like that.
It was dark and it was late at night by this time so I couldn't just pull over to get the ring.
At this point I was so upset that I just drove home in silence.
When we got home, she just went into the house.
No talking or anything.
Just complete silence.
She jumps into the shower and leaves her phone on the dresser.
Now normally I would never go through her phone because I was raised knowing about Pandora's box.
For those who don't know Pandora's box is a Greek myth about a certain jar that contains many sins, troubles and other bad things.
Once you are knowledgeable about this there's no turning back.
Anyway I was going to leave her phone alone until I heard a buzz.
Curiosity got the best of me so I lean over to see a message.
The message says please don't do this.
Now I know my wife's password and she knows mine.
I check the messages and to my dismay I was horrified.
It was her work chat.
They were telling her to not do anything stupid to me or it may backfire.
I kept scrolling up and I seen pictures of bruises and scars that my wife sent to the chat.
She said that she is leaving me and if she has to drag me through the mud then so be it.
I was heartbroken.
All these years we were together.
We laughed and cried together.
How could she be plotting such a heinous crime against me?
Anyway I hear the water from the shower turn off and I switch off her phone and run out the room so she won't suspect anything.
I run to the other room and begin to cry.
I cover my mouth so I wouldn't draw attention but I was so hurt.
After a few minutes I gather myself together and I just go to the closet, grab a bag and head to the room where I begin to pack.
She is getting dressed and drying her hair.
She asked me what am I doing.
I said nothing.
She throws a vase that my late mother bought us towards my head and I duck.
It shatters everywhere.
I immediately grab a handful of clothes, and told her that I know what she is doing and it's best that we call things off.
She said that unless I want to go to jail I will stay right here.
I turn to walk away when I hear a scream.
She started hitting herself and blood was everywhere.
I immediately turn to bolt and she grabs me smearing her blood on my shirt.
I was horrified.
Knowing you're about to be set up and watching it unfold is a terrible and traumatic thing to witness.
I finally break free but it's too late.
By the time I got outside the police were there.
One guy who I think was a rookie grabs me and throws me to the ground.
I sprained my wrist during the fall.
Handcuffs are placed on me and my wife is faking tears.
I looked at her asking why would she do this.
She said it's time I pay for my crimes.
The police takes me down to the station where I am booked and placed in the jail cell.
The charge was assault with intent to kill.
Since there was blood on my shirt I was already seen as guilty by the cops.
Since it was the weekend I knew there was no judge so I was in there for the time being.
I called my fellow colleagues, explained the story and they were shocked.
They said to not represent myself.
They would send a lawyer and to keep my head low until Monday.
There were a few situations where I was about to get my ass kicked because word got around that I was some wife beater and the jail has some sort of moral code about women and kids.
Ironic isn't it?
Anyway monday morning comes and I stand before a judge.
Of course I enter in a not guilty please and I was released on bail.
The bail was for $35,000 in total.
That's crazy because even if I did the crime which we all know I didn't I was a first time offender, never even had a speeding ticket.
I never even got in trouble in school.
But to be a first time offender the bail was pretty harsh.
Anyway my firm put up the money and I was released.
I had to go to my home to get my things but was uncertain because I had no idea if my wife was at work or not.
My co worker let's call him Steve 34 male took me to my house.
We drove past my house and my wife's car wasn't there.
I thought she must have went to work and I told him that I don't feel comfortable going alone because she may be there and I just need to grab my bag that I dropped in the living room.
He says that he will walk with me.
We go to the house and I have my keys on me so I go into the house.
I quickly grab my bag and walk out the door.
We go to his car and he asks me what am I going to do now.
I told that I am ok that I will have to take a few days off and that he could drop me off at a nearby hotel.
He agreed and we leave.
We go to a nice hotel and he pays for me to check in for a few days.
After the third day my partners come to my room and ask how do I want to proceed with my wife.
I told them that I want to divorce her as soon as possible.
They opened the briefcase and gave me some papers.
Apparently they already had the secretary draft the paperwork.
They informed me that they will have the magistrate to serve her by lunchtime.
Quickly sign them without hesitation.
Later on in the afternoon I got a phone call.
It was my wife and she had some words for me.
She screamed, she cursed and she said that she is going to make my life a living hell.
I simply hung up and blocked her number.
Later on I got a phone call from a man.
He claims that he works with my wife.
He asked to meet me so I agreed to meet at a neutral location so that I can see what he wanted.
We meet the next day at a coffee shop.
He was reluctant to speak at first but he decided to spill the beans.
He apologized for all that I went through.
He explained that my wife was dealing with something personal and he couldnt share that part.
However he heard in the break room about how my wife was planning to set me up.
Many of the coworkers tried to stop her but she was losing it.
He didn't know how to reach me so he did a background check on me using my name and when he seen the criminal history he knew he found me so he got my number and reached out.
I told him I appreciate it and I asked of he would be willing to testify on my behalf.
He was unsure at first but then he agreed as he felt that this was the right thing to do.
We shake hands and I told him to leave first.
He knew I was on edge so he said goodbye and he left.
I make it back to my hotel and I just sigh.
10 years and it's over just like that.
Later came the trial. My wife knew she was lying and she even put on the waterworks for the jury.
When Steve cross examined her he asked her that if she knew perjury was a crime.
Her lawyer obviously objected and of course it was sustained.
Steve then went on to say that he no longer wants to interview my wife and that he wanted to Introduce a final witness.
The judge allowed it and in walked her coworker.
When I tell you my wife went pale it was like she have seen a ghost.
He approached the stand and he told the court exactly what he heard.
He gave dates, times and locations.
He even mentioned the group chat where he is apart of that he seen her plotting to set me up.
He had screenshots and Steve submitted them into evidence.
The judge reviewed this and he said that this is ridiculous.
He looks at me and he apologized for everything that I went through.
Before he slammed his gavel Steve spoke up and asked that we be granted an Emergency divorce.
The judge asked on what grounds.
Steve went on to say that we had recordings of my wife threatening me after she was served with the divorce papers and that with the current history it would be unwise for this marriage to continue.
The judge signed and granted the divorce on the spot.
We didn't have a prenuptial agreement but she still gets nothing.
Her lawyer was pissed but he just walks out.
My now ex wife was angry and storms out of he courtroom.
We go to celebrate as I am now a free man.
I probably won't ever date or marry again.
However I can finally breath.

Update:
Shortly I filed a lawsuit against the police for wrongful arrest and police brutality.
They decided to settle out of court for a lot of money.
2.5 million dollars to be exact.
So right now I am on cloud nine.
My ex wife was convicted of perjury, false report to the police and conspiracy charges.
Although I didn't want to see her go through that, she has no one to blame but herself. 
This was her Karma.
After the divorce some years later my ex wife reaches out to me.
She just got out of jail after two years for perjury, false report to the police and conspiracy.
She seems calm and asks if we can talk.
I hung up the phone.
She calls back again and she asks if we can meet.
I am still at the hotel and I told her that I will text the address and she can meet there.
We meet 20 miles away from the hotel.
I know I am paranoid at this point.
We sit down and she takes a deep breath.
She apologizes for everything that she has done.
She explains after everything happened her parents found out and she possibly going to lose her inheritance.
Yeah you heard that right.
She came from a rich family and although I am not particularly close with my former in laws they actually like me and they respected how I worked hard for what I have.
I asked her what does that have to do with me.
She went on to explain what actually was going on with her.
Apparently since she was 16 she has been struggling with her sexuality.
She was sent abroad to study after she told her mother that she might be gay.
For years she tried to suppressed it.
Then she met me.
She wanted to tell me so badly but she seen how sweet I was and she thought that she could forget how she feels and move on.
Many years later when she looked in the mirror and didn't recognize who she was. Then she snapped.
I was getting teary eyed at this point.
I asked her why didn't she just tell me.
Why would she try to ruin my life.
If she was honest about it I would be hurt for sure but I wouldn't have judged her.
I would have supported her and helped her with her parents.
She said she regrets it all.
However she needs my help.
Her parents are going to drop her from the will and she will lose the inheritance.
Her parents are old traditional Christians and do not believe in divorce.
She said that if I were to help her that she will share the inheritance with me.
I take a deep breath and asked her didn't she learn anything.
She looks puzzled.
I went on to name the charges that she was just convicted for and one of those was lying before the judge.
Now she wants to lie to her parents.
She looks away and says that I don't understand and I am being selfish because it all worked out for me.
That was the benediction.
I slowly get up and walk away.
I turn around and tell her that I will speak to her parents about the inheritance.
Not because I care for you it's because I pity what you have become, but this is the last thing I will do for you.
I told her to call it a divorce present and after this lose my number and never contact me again.
I walked out of the place and go to my car.
It was a long drive home so I put on some backstreet boys.
That's right I like the backstreet boys sue me.

Update 2:
Ok guys this is my final update and I am uncertain where to start.
It's been a year since I last updated and I have been so busy I forgot.
I talked to her parents and they were upset that I wasn't going to stay with their daughter.
They went on to say that couples fight and that we should make up and move on.
I asked my ex wife's parents if she can get her inheritance.
They said no and they wouldn't budge.
I informed them that I know everything.
How she was gay, how they sent her away, how they played me and accepted my wedding gift of $250,000 knowing their daughters sexuality.
I told them that they owe me and if they didn't give her the damn inheritance then I would take them to civil court and sue them for emotional distress.
I know I didn't have a case but they are a well known family and a lawsuit would be the talk of the town so they said that they will send her the inheritance now and that was over before I knew it.
I hang up the phone and I blew a sigh of relief.
That day I sat down and grabbed a bottle of wine and watch reruns of my favorite TV show on Netflix.
Although single life is kind of new I would rather be single than to trust another woman again after this.
I know all women are not like this but it is best to just focus on work and live my life to the fullest.
Thanks to everyone reading this and I hope that everyone enjoyed this bumpy ride.

I have about 5K in CC debt left to pay off (my car is my next challenge, but I want to get the CC debt gone) and I want to rebuild my savings so this is the best way to do it. My terms are this:

- no new makeup/clothes/skincare unless repurchasing something that is empty or no longer usable (I go thru jeans so quickly, thanks chub rub!)
- no home decor or housewares, I have enough
- eating out limited to 2x a month, try to cut out completely
- take out coffees limited to 1x a week as a treat but try to limit as much as possible

My goal is to create a sustainable no buy while saving money and paying down debt, so eating out and coffees are something I'll try to limit as much as possible but I know myself and sometimes you just need a treat!

What helped me get here: 

1 - I got some heat for this earlier here but I ghosted a girl who told me that she preferred alcohol over dinner. For some context this was an attractive IG girl that I was thinking about going on a date with. I was trying to come up with ideas for a first date and she made it very clear that she prefers alcohol over food... I decided to ignore her as meeting her would have gotten me in trouble. It worked. 

2 - Avoiding friends who just want to go out and drink. There's a lot of them... Yes. Maybe a little harsh. Not sure if they are really friends anyways. I just turn left if they are going right. 

3 - I just don't go to bars! I replaced this with hanging out at gyms, coffee shops and food courts in shopping malls. The treadmill and my Macbook get to see me more often. 

You can call me Casper the ghost. I'm running away from the 3 wicked uncles... hahaha

I'll keep ghosting whoever drinks and endroits where it is the central activity! 

Maybe I've turned into a little bit of a loner but I feel great and I have better and more fulfilling things to do now... 

Would rather be on a date with someone or with friends who are on the same page as me. My Macbook counts as a friend right? :)",2,1734017801.0,stopdrinking,1,0.75,False

This is to help all the hundreds of questions people make every day on this sub ~~without searching first.~~ I read thru one of this and it helped me a bunch, so hope it helps. 

  
General info

* I'm female traveling solo. Is it safe? Yes. Be street smart and listen to locals. 
* At night I walked around  Roma, Roma Norte, Condessa, Polanco, Juarez, Zona Rosa, Hipodromo, super safe. (I'm brazilian so that makes me very used to potential risks so be aware.)
* If your phone doesn't work with e-sim, you can buy a SIM card in the airport, right after you leave the gate. Even 7-11 sells them but there are some mobile stores you can buy iy from
* Don't bother leaving the airport by bus, it's too much work and Uber is cheap and safe. 
* A trip from the airport to La Condessa in traffic is 40-50 min (or more), no traffic 20 min
* I stayed at La Condessa. Great place to stay, but gentrified and overpriced (almost only gringos around). Closest Metro station was Patriotismo (1km away). 
* I couldnt, for the life of me, figure out the purple small buses. Only bus I could figure out was the Metrobus so I stuck with the metro which was ok (but not enough, I did a LOOOT OF WALKING). 
* Mexicans have lunch LATE. Majority of restaurants will **start** serving lunch at 1pm. I usually eat at 11 so I had to 
* I didn't try street food cause traveling solo I was afraid of food poisoning. Don't come at me, it was a personal decision based on experience. you can lick the street for what I'm concerned. 
* Please don't be an AH, mexicans speak SPANISH. learn at least a few words. I've seen  too many people starting conversations in english without even saying hola or buen dia. this is not your backyard, please have manners. (same for brazilians but I think not many ill read this post). 

CDMX

* I stayed 7 days which I feel is too much if you are not leaving the city (Puebla, Cuernavaca etc). 
* Public transport is cheap, 5 - 8 pesos depending which one you're using. 
* Actual itinerary
   * Day 0 - Unplanned cause my flight changed so I visited the Museo Natural in Chapultepec and the Chapultepec Castillo. This park (called bosque) is HUUUGEEE. 
   * Day 1 - Centro historico walking tour, explored centro, ate at La Casa de To√±o
   * Day 2 - Coyoacan, Frida's museum, Coyoacan's market, ther's also a mercado de artesanias on the main square. 
   * Day 3 - Museo de Arqueologia - You'll need the whole day and it won't be enough. You can go chronological order (before homo sapiens to ""modern"" era) or what I suggest, start with the Mayans so you are fresh and not already overwhelmed with history. Museo has a good restaurant and coffee shop inside so you are covered. Lunch starts being served at 1 pm. 
   * Day 4  - Teotihuacan. Yes you need a guide otherwise it's just a bunch of old structures you wont's understand. I hired a tour that picked me up close to my airbnb, best choice ever. I chose one that is just Teotihuacan, no tourist traps (stop at shops, bad restaurant included, etc), best decision ever. I can post the link for it inthe comments if anyone wants it. 
   * Day 5 - Bas√≠lica de Guadalupe. You can get there by metro but go as early as possible. After 11 several tours will arrive and it will be super crowded. I got there arounf 8:30, there were lots of sitting space for the ongoing Mass service. place is huge, toilet is paid for and its store (yes) is great. bought a silver virgen de guadalupe pendant for my mom, cheap and beautiful! all silver there is great price. on the outside there are hundreds of small shops selling religious items, never seem so many lol. price also pretty good. 

Playa Del Carmen

* Stayed at Barrio Latino, 1 min from main street Quinta Avenida where everything happens and 3 min from the actual beach. 
* If you stay in Centro noise will most likely bother you cause all night clubs are loud af. If you stay a bit farther away, most likely will not have this issue. 
* Centro is walkable, there's virtually everything you need there including 3 malls (??????). 
* Beach clubs prices will vary widely not only in price but also vibe. I chose a cheaper one (150 pesos for chair  + umbrella + consumption) because they were not blasting music at 9am but if this is your vibe, you will find one for you
* There are several public beaches but it means no / limited shade. some beaches have public palapas so arrive early to get yours
* Playa is a 2 for 1 city: you have nature and night life. from 8 to 2/3pm you'll se mainly families at the beach. after that time groups of young people with their JBLs will arrive so you'll be listening to 4 - 5 different music. I personally hate it, so I always left at 3pm
* I hired my 2 tours on a travel agency at Quinta Avenida. The one to Isla Mujeres couldn't be better! Unfortunately the sea was pretty wild that day so we had to skip snorkiling and swimming in open sea. The on to Chichen Itz√° was a nightmare
* Chicken Itz√° - I've travelled around wuite a bit but this place AMAZED ME. BUT the agency I went with, jesus f christ. They made a 2h drive (4 round trip) to Chichen into a 15h hour bus ride. Every chance they had to try to ~~scam~~ sell something, they did. In the end we had 2h in Chichen Itz√° site which is NOTHING, with only 1h with a guide who btw, was local and was really knowledgeble. I would never ever ever ever hire them: Cancun Bay Tours. 
* The most beautiful place I've been was Playa Punta Esmeralda that has a small cenote + calm turquoise waters, lots of families, safe. To get there by public transport is a bit tricky (you can go by taxi or rent a car as well, which I didn't want to). You need to go to Calle 30, catch the van that says 30/30 Final and get out at Calle 110. Then you walk for 15 min. The first part of the walk is not touritsty at all, it's very local. Also: no food/ drinks vendors so bring your own.
* **I** would avoid restaurants on Quinta Avenida, they are targeted to tourists so its a blander, americanized and overpriced version of mexican food. There's actually a restaurant that is called Karen's so...
* Instead got to El Fog√≥n where you can eat local food at very reasonable price. Portions are huge, everything tastes amazing! It's always busy so it might be a few minutes before you sit.

The following letters were found in the mailbox of Alden's office at Glover & Sons:

August 6th

Dear Mr. Alden,

I am sorry to bother you when you are busy with your work. I did not find you in the company, so I can only leave this message in your mailbox. I am James Green, and I'm sure you remember me. This morning you reprimanded me for not being able to submit the company log file you had asked me to compile‚ÄîI'm very sorry about that, and I know that the deadline you set for me was last night. So even though you said some not-so-gentle things to me in front of everyone, I fully understand.

However, please allow me to explain that you asked me to organize all the log files from the past five years for the company. Additionally, you have always had extremely high standards for our work regarding accuracy, readability, and typographical errors‚ÄîI mean no disrespect; I believe this reflects your pragmatic, serious, and meticulous approach to work, which is what a capable leader like you should do. I have invested all my energy into this task and have been working tirelessly all week, and have only slept for three hours each night for the past four nights.

Therefore, I swear that the delay in submitting the files is not due to negligence on my part. I can assure you that the organization is in its final stages, and if you grant me one more night, I will complete the files by tonight. I implore you to grant me this one more night, and I kindly ask you not to judge me negatively because of this incident. I need this job to eat and pay my rent, and I sincerely hope to continue working under your wise leadership. I hope you can forgive this delay.

With best wishes

August 7th

Dear Esteemed, Talented, and Magnanimous Mr. Alden,

It is I again, James Green. You did not seek me out again yesterday, nor did you delegate anyone to discuss the matter of the file with me. I take your silence as consent to the extension I requested in my letter, for which I am extremely grateful, and I wholeheartedly wish you continued success and advancement within the company.

But... I apologize, I truly do not wish to say this, but I must inform you with deep regret and self-reproach that I fear I will not be able to submit my file today.

I know! I know I'm two days behind! But before you get angry, let me explain to you what is going on, which is in any case very strange.

It was around 2:30 AM when I finally completed everything, and all files were meticulously organized according to your high standards and strict requirements. Every single word and sentence has been meticulously proofread and corrected by me. For some inexplicable reason, the company's log files were all written in a style reminiscent of narrative poetry, making this task far from easy. You would be extremely satisfied to see it.

But just as I was about to tidy them up and place them on your desk, something strange occurred. I do not mean to exaggerate, but what happened next was a completely bizarre incident. I inadvertently opened the first page of the file again to look at it, and I discovered that the text, which I had laid out neatly, had somehow turned into a complete mess. All the sentences on the page were shattered into a jumble of letters, punctuation marks, and even the lines and circles that form the letters, jumbled up on the paper with ink blots spreading everywhere, like alphabet cereal spilled on the floor and run over by a car.

Please, hold off on judging whether to believe this or not! Not just you, but even I couldn't believe my own eyes. I started flipping through the pages... and every single page had become like this! I've spent an entire week organizing these files! All the paragraphs I meticulously proofread have turned into chaos!!!

As you can imagine, I was nearly out of my mind. But what was even more outrageous was yet to come. As I was screaming and flipping to the last page, I managed to catch the culprit that had messed up the files‚Äîjust in the nick of time.

It was the icon of a small white sailboat. As I watched, it was sailing down the lines of text on the paper, and the once neat and clear text was instantly shattered in its wake, leaving a trail of mangled words in its wake.

I was stunned and wanted to stop the sailboat, but what could I possibly do against an icon drawn on paper? Draw a seawall to block it? Before I could react, the sailboat had already smashed all the words on the last page of the file to smithereens and then slipped away through the footer.

That's what happened. The files have been utterly destroyed, and I'm truly at a loss for tears now. I know it sounds outrageous, but please believe me. I have enclosed a page of the file with this letter, so you can see how the text has been scattered and shredded by the sailboat. (If I recall correctly, this page was originally about Glover Sr.'s beautiful speech on board purity.)

With best wishes.

August 8th

Mr. Alden, your silence is unsettling to me. I know what you must be thinking: that I've concocted some absurd tale to avoid my work, and you're likely contemplating how to dismiss me. Please, believe me, I assure you this is all true. You know I've always been a rational and hardworking employee, never complaining. Do I strike you as the type to fabricate such stories?

Indeed, it was late, and you might think I was delirious from exhaustion or stress, hallucinating. But I swear I was as clear-headed as ever, having consumed countless cups of coffee. And I took a dose of sodium bromide solution each time I worked past two in the morning to keep my mind steady. (It's not cheap, but I purchased it at my own expense to ensure the task you assigned was completed perfectly, demonstrating my loyalty and diligence to both you and the company.) So I can assure you once again, everything I've said is true.

I'm unsure what happened to the page of files I sent you, but the ones here, affected by the little white boat, have started to wrinkle and yellow this morning, as if they had been sitting in my grandmother's attic for decades. This is clearly not normal; something supernatural is clearly at play.

So I implore you not to dismiss me so hastily. I truly cannot afford to lose this job. Please be assured that I will not ignore this matter, and I will investigate and get to the bottom of what's happening with the little white boat, and I will definitely provide you with a satisfactory explanation. I have a friend named Clifton who is well-versed in such peculiar matters, and if anyone can understand what I'm dealing with, it's him. You see, I already have a plan in place. I ask you to grant me two more days. And, regardless of your decision regarding me, please provide me with a response, as it is crucial in alleviating my anxiety.

With best wishes.

August 9th

Mr. Alden, with all due respect, your prolonged silence is rather impolite. Whether you're dismissing my letters as a joke and laughing at me with your friends, or preparing to terminate my employment, I believe I deserve a response, if only to hear your thoughts casually.

This situation has caused significant disruption in my life. I've been overwhelmed with this ridiculous white boat issue. You've given me no further guidance, so I've continued my investigation as previously outlined in my letter. I met with Clifton, who has eyes as piercing as yours, and most importantly, he believes what I've seen.

I think that's what he meant; to be honest, I didn't understand most of his words, so it's not my fault if I've misunderstood. He gave me the address of a bookstore and a small silver compass, claiming they would help me find answers.

So I eagerly rushed to the dimly lit bookstore and searched for a long time. And then... I found nothing. I couldn't understand any of the books, for heaven's sake, some were even written in Greek! Greek! What planet still speaks Greek? As for the compass, it's broken! It doesn't work at all! Damn Clifton!

All in all, I am truly exhausted by this whole affair. When I finally collapsed into bed at night, I noticed I was losing my hair. No, to be precise, I've been losing my hair ever since I started working overtime. If you don't provide me with a more reassuring response, I'm afraid I'll go bald!

I also had a very poor night's sleep, filled with dreams. I've read health publications, which indicate that my mental state and hormonal balance are in a terrible state. Look at this, it's all the price I've paid for the company and for you. I dreamt that I was standing on a road coiled at the top of a mountain, with a blinding silver light in the sky. Somehow, in my dream, I found myself still clutching the compass, and the needle on it actually began to move.

I followed the compass's directions, wandering forward in a daze, and before long, I found myself in a forest, a truly strange place where the branches of the trees grew haphazardly, as if on drugs, without any logic. Through the trees, I could faintly see large white moths flitting about. I stumbled along the way, forcefully pushing branches aside. There seemed to be some faint paths. I'm quite adept at finding my way, and I spent an entire week navigating through the mountain of files you gave me to complete my work. How could this be too difficult for me? Finally, I thought I saw a white arch...

Wait,why am I even telling you about my dream? I'm telling you this to show you that I've given my all to this. This morning, when I woke up, my head was pounding, and random words I don't understand were swimming through my mind. I ask you, does this count as a work-related injury? Asking for a response from you, not compensation, seems fair to me. I implore you, please, please, give me an answer today on what I should do next.

With best wishes.

I hope you are really good!

August 10th

Alden! I warn you, don't bully those weaker than you! If you're going to fire me, do it quickly and don't be a coward about it. I'm standing outside your office today, and I won't leave until I get some answers. You can bet on it.

Do you think this is easy for me? Do you think I'm just making up stories? Do you know how close to madness your ridiculous tasks have driven me? Do you even know what I've been through these past few nights? Last night, I couldn't sleep a wink, tossing and turning until the early hours. And guess what I dreamed of? That white door and a horde of zombies! Yeah, a horde of fucking zombies!

Those zombies, limping and jostling, were pushing and shoving me towards the white door. I was scared enough to spit out my bile. Once through the door, some zombies even started scratching at the rocks with their fingernails. You should have heard it, hey! All I could think about was getting the hell out of there, so I ran, following the compass's direction, all night long. And guess what happened? The zombies were gone, but I encountered something even more absurd. A half-dead golden deer head, the size of a carriage, was talking to me in front of another arch! He's talking to me. He doesn't even have a chin. Why is he talking to me?

Don't play dumb with me, you know exactly what's going on, and don't tell me you've forgotten that last month you made me babysit your kids during work hours, and your son, so young and damn brilliant, insisted I read him an entire horror story from a pulp magazine! I'm certain it's the psychological trauma from that experience that's causing these bizarre dreams, so you see? You're responsible for this! This morning, I woke up cold as if I had just emerged from an ice cellar, and my health has definitely been affected, you understand? You're accountable for this! I'm coming for you today!

Forget the best wishes! You better show up quickly, or I'll introduce you to my zombie-touched palm and show you what's truly real!

August 11^(th)

Alden! You bastard! You're deliberately avoiding me, aren't you? I can't understand it. You were always so arrogant, but now you're hiding like a coward?

Do you have any idea how much trouble this has caused me? The emotional distress you've caused me is immeasurable, and I'm taking you to court! I demand that you take responsibility, apologize to me, and compensate me for the emotional damage!

Thanks to you, I've been dreaming about searching for files for three nights in a row! Now, I'm not looking for the files to fulfill my duties anymore, but to slam them in your face, which you've been using to throw your weight around. I want you to see if what I've said is true and to realize what you've been doubting me for!

Last night, in my dream, I saw the sickly deer head again, and it spoke to me with its crippled mouth in front of the gate: ""What must be opened before the path can be opened?"" I asked if it was a riddle. For crying out loud, how the hell should I know what to open? Why don't you use your antlers, which look like they haven't been washed in centuries, to open my bones instead? As soon as I said that, the large barrier that had been blocking the gate suddenly opened.

Hey, I've figured it out. This deer is just like you, Alden‚Äîall bluster and no substance, never getting ahead in life! After entering, I could still hear it wailing behind me, and sooner or later, I'll make you cry just like it!

I continued to follow the compass and eventually arrived at a hall with a painted river on the floor. Right in the middle of it, I saw the little white boat icon that had destroyed my files, floating there.

I leaped at it, not quite sure how, but I seemed to step into the painting and found myself on the deck of the ship. There was a man dressed like a captain, directing a sailor at the helm. When they heard the noise of me hitting the deck, both turned to look at me in surprise.

Without a second thought, my body acted on what I've been wanting to do for days. I rushed up, grabbed the captain by his collar, and slammed him onto the ground. You destroyed my files, my job, my life, my health, everything! Give me back my files, damn you! Can you hear me, you son of a bitch, sailing around in your wretched boat, wrecking everything in your path uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-ÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ?!

Once the sailors pulled me off, the captain was able to stand up again, shakily asking who I was and what I wanted. Thankfully, some of my anger had subsided by then, and yelling at an old face so close by was quite cathartic. I can't wait to do the same to you, Alden.

I told him about the file, and then he whispered with some of the sailors, discussing. I couldn't make out much of their conversation, only catching snippets like 'furious atmosphere' and 'very dangerous.' I knew they must have been discussing me with contempt, just as you discuss my letters with your colleagues. The difference was they gave me an answer in five minutes, you hear that, Alden? Take a lesson!

They told me they were very sorry for destroying my file, though they couldn't restore it, but offered me some monetary compensation. It doesn't matter, I didn't want to hand over that file anyway. This morning, for some reason, I found a silver coin in my hand, it looked quite valuable, and I'm not planning on working anymore! Alden, it's not you dismiss me, it's me dismiss you! I'll see you in court!

May you always be so stupid and stubborn that you never get promoted!

August 12^(th)

Dear Police Officer, I apologize for imposing on you in such a manner. I am James Green, and you likely know of me if you have seen the letters I previously left in the mailbox.

I understand that these letters may appear strange and suspicious, but let me explain that I was truly unaware of anything concerning Mr. Alden's case. As you can see from those letters, I was oblivious to the fact that he had not responded because he had never seen my letters, thinking all along that he was deliberately making things difficult for me. It was not until today, upon seeing your police car, that I learned from a colleague about his disappearance after noon on August 6th.

Though my tone in those letters may have been somewhat irritable, I assure you that after working for Mr. Alden for so long, we had a pleasant and complementary working relationship, if not one of deep trust and shared fortunes. I absolutely harbor no ill intentions towards Mr. Alden, and his disappearance has no connection to me. As for the threats of legal action I mentioned in my letters, they were mere impulsive remarks spoken in the heat of the moment. Now that he's missing, I am extremely anxious and distressed, and naturally, I would not cause him any trouble.

To prove my innocence, I'm even willing to provide a lead. I find it suspicious that the man who recently replaced Mr. Alden seems quite dubious. He spends his leisure time reading peculiar books. I once overheard him discussing Mr. Alden's matters with a man who had a knife in his boot at the local pub known for its excellent Scotch eggs. You see, I'm sharing everything I know.

Therefore, I swear that I am an upright and law-abiding citizen. Please don't let those letters make you suspicious of me, and I implore you not to let the other leaders in the company see those letters. I need this job to eat and pay my rent.

**TLDR:**  I‚Äôm brewing everything at 85C.  And it all tastes glorious.  Notes from 17 different coffees included.  Brewed in one week, one cup of each, no adjustments to grind, temp, or recipe.  Recipe at the end.

**\*\*¬†Backstory:\*\***

I‚Äôve been experimenting with Co-ferments and Anaerobic processed beans for the last 2 months.  It‚Äôs a new experience for me after drinking ‚Äútraditional‚Äù medium to medium light pourovers for the last 12-14 years. I‚Äôve even been known to love a great dark roasted Sumatra on pourover when it‚Äôs roasted well.

In an effort to kill some aggressive acidity that walked back and forth between bitter and sour as I dialed in coffees, rarely finding a true sweet spot, I bought a Hario Switch.  

It Didn‚Äôt help.

I had reset the zero point on the Ode Gen 2.  All that did was delay me a couple days as I adjusted my recipes and my brain to the new settings.  But now I was closer to what other people reported for the Ode grinder settings.  My old 4.1 was now 6 or 6.1 (not sure if it was 5 or 6 clicks because I‚Äôm a klutz at times).

I started playing with my water again, eventually landing on my own adaptation of Holy Water with a bit more carbonate hardness.  60 GH with a 50/50 split between Mg & Ca, 40 KH from Potassium Bicarbonate. This was after enjoying what TWW had been doing for my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù beans from local roasters.

That water change at least eliminated the ‚Äúundrinkables‚Äù - for the most part.

Add being new to the Ode 2 Grinder and some CAFEC T-90s in the mix, and there were many beans I felt like I chased for most of the bag.  At the very least, I KNEW I wasn‚Äôt getting the best out of them.

*But not any more!*

**\*\*The ‚ÄúA-ha‚Äù Moment\*\***

I finally found my go-to starting point with the Hario Switch.  And so far it is producing good to great cups with every bean I‚Äôve tried - 17 so far.  One after the other.  Same recipe, same grind.  Basically set it and forget it hybrid pourover.

And these were all kinds of beans - conferments, anaerobic, and more traditional natural or washed process beans.  Four of them are brand new but rested - never brewed a single cup of them. I even considered cracking open Onyx Framily and Krampus just a few days off roast just to see - but resisted.  :)

What got me started with this recipe is I knew I was really close.  Some great cups, but many edgy and acidic, borderline undrinkable cups.  Then I opened the Brainwave Roasters Edwin Norena Galaxy Hop Coferment, and I LOVED the first cup.  As a big IPA fan, the aroma was amazing, and the flavors were great.  But it still had the grapefruit pith bitternesss that had plagued every conferment I‚Äôve tried.

I was pretty convinced that co-ferments simply weren‚Äôt for me.

With this coffee, it kind of fit, but it was still overpowering.  I had brewed it at 95C.  Everything else felt so on point in the cup, and I had been chasing water, recipe, and grind, but rarely moved much on temp - other than to come Up and DOWN from 97-98C. Occasionally 92C.  Rarely 90C.

I grabbed my bag of Counter Culture Hologram and made a cup.  Also had a similar grapefruit bitterness - which is kind of hard to do with that coffee.

So I tried the Norena at 92C.  Definitely better.  All the other flavors were still there.  Amazing aroma.  Just less biting acidity.  I had tried a few other beans at 90C, and they were still acidic - felt sour and under-extracted.

But I figured *‚ÄúWTF, let‚Äôs go down to 85C. I‚Äôve got 300 grams left‚Ä¶‚Äù* Which for someone who has primarily done off-boil brews for over a decade seemed insane.

But, I knew that more processed coffees are easier to extract, and none of my other attempts to remove this one consistent flavor note had worked.  So why not? It definitely wasn‚Äôt the individual beans.  It wasn‚Äôt the water. It wasn‚Äôt the brewer.  It had to be process related. So either something was contaminated (I had cleaned the kettle and the grinder a couple times in this journey), or it was temperature.

Boom!  Amazing cup.  Maybe the best cup I‚Äôve had in weeks.  It helps that the beans and the roast were amazing.  But I felt I was on to something.  So I decided to try the one coffee I haven‚Äôt gotten a truly good cup from yet:  B&W Red Fruits.

And it was Sooo much better.  Still one of my least favorites, but nothing that felt like a ‚Äúflawed cup‚Äù.  Just not my thing.

**\*\*The Bean Reviews\*\***

I decided to try every bean I have in the house.  In one week.  One cup after another, any time I wanted a coffee.  No repeats.  No second chances.

Here‚Äôs the results of 1 cup, same recipe, same grind.  As if I only had one shot at brewing the bean.  Even if I thought other settings would be better.  Made me happy I had saved small amounts of most of the beans I had worked through:

* **\*\*BrainWave Roasters Hop Coferment:\*\***  Roasty black IPA flavors, with a Long Island Ice tea chaser. ;). The fruitiness kind of shifts throughout the cup between dark raspberry, peach, and chocolate-covered orange.  Great Body. Just 3 weeks off roast, so this will be a mainstay of my morning routine through the end of the year.  So damn good.
* **\*\*Dak Milky Cake:\*\*** Nailed the milky Vanilla cake; best body I‚Äôve gotten, balanced acidity, a little cinnamon spice. It was the last dose of beans I had, so they had lost a bit of the Cardamom spice.
* **\*\*Black & White Red Fruits:\*\*** Still strong boozy fruits, crisp acidity, a touch of chocolate on the finish.  Light body.  Sadly, there are still some beans left in the bag.  Lol.  Maybe they‚Äôll be better at 8 weeks off roast?  :)
* **\*\*Rogue Wave Granja Paraiso ‚Äô92 Anaerobic Decaf:\*\***  Man!  Didn‚Äôt know decaf could be this good.  Chocolate covered strawberries with a decent body, nice fruity aroma. I have a cup or two of this every week, and this is the best yet.
* **\*\*Black & White Esteban Zamora Anaerobic Cinnamon:¬†\*\***Smooth Cinnamon notes, touch of apple and berry.  This is 6 weeks off roast now, and will be wrapped up in the next 2 or so most likely.  Early January at the latest.  Need to save some to have with Christmas Cookies.  It was very enjoyable.
* **\*\*Proud Mary Lazy Sunday:\*\*** Just a darn fine cup of coffee, with notes of almond and dark chocolate with a hint of sweet citrus. One of my coffees for non-coffee-nerd guests.
* **\*\*Brain Wave Ethiopia Guji Wush Wush:¬†\*\*** First cup, new bag.  3 weeks off roast.  Bright berry, decent acidity, probably will grind a bit finer when dialing in for a bit more extraction and body. Needs more rest for me.
* **\*\*September Coconut Crush\*\*** \- Nailed the tasting notes in that way that makes you grab the bag and read it again‚Ä¶ and then go see what else is on their website right now. Great cup.  Made me consider stopping my ‚Äòexperiment‚Äô and just finishing off this bag.
* **\*\*Dak Coco Bongo:¬†\*\***I kind of feel like *‚ÄúOK, I get it now.‚Äù*  Best, most full bodied cup I‚Äôve had of it.  Pineapple notes were still pretty strong, but definitely much more coconut sweetness.  Last full dose.
* **\*\*Ghost Cordillera de Fuego Anaerobic:¬†\*\*** Smooth cinnamon and vanilla aroma.  Much sweeter cup.  Cinnamon notes are more subdued, berry is more prevalent, with a nice floral note.  What was a slightly dry finish is now lingering, sweet, and creamy.  Better than 95C and finer grind?  Or is it just the extra 2 weeks of rest?  Not sure.  But it‚Äôs really good.  Non-coffee nerds would probably just say ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs good coffee.‚Äù And they‚Äôd probably also be shocked there was no sugar in it.  It‚Äôs another I could be perfectly happy just finishing off the bag and not finishing this experiment. And now I want to go see what else they have in stock‚Ä¶ and I really want another cup.
* **\*\*Rogue Wave Ethiopia Nguisse Nare Bombe:\*\***  I truly wanted to grind this one finer and go hotter.  It‚Äôs a blueberry bomb I‚Äôve been enjoying.  But even at these presumed sub-optimal settings, it‚Äôs an enjoyable cup. Nice body, more sweetness, but it loses the brightness and berry notes and highlights the apricot-type fruit flavors. Dark chocolate on the finish as it cools.
* **\*\*Counter Culture Hologram:\*\*** My go-to *‚Äúoh crap I don‚Äôt have any coffee, so what‚Äôs at Whole Foods?*‚Äù coffee.  Mostly for guests at this point, or for when I need a recalibration, because I know it well.  It‚Äôs kind of my ‚ÄúSamuel Adams‚Äù of coffee beans.  Well, consider me recalibrated!  This tastes like a cherry cordial chased by a Dr. Pepper!  Without the sugary sweetness, just the fruity and caramel sweet notes.  Syrupy and creamy.  But it does almost get a little cloying.  It never tasted this good.
* **\*\*Rogue Wave Granja Paraiso 92 Sudan Rume:\*\*** First Cup. Dude, I cannot express how badly I wanted to go finer and hotter.  Everything in my being said *‚ÄúDo it! Screw the experiment!‚Äù*   But I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt.  This is a more subtle, harmonious yet complex blend of flavors, but I love the sweetness I get to underpin the fruity and even spicy ginger notes.  I may grind finer for the next cup and try a little hotter, but this is still excellent.  There‚Äôs almost a lactic acid sweetness and creaminess on the finish as the cup cools - like I had a sip of lavender mango milkshake a few minutes before taking a sip of coffee.
* **\*\*Rogue Wave Ethiopia Chelbesa One:\*\***  Sample Bag, second and last cup. It‚Äôs almost like eating apricot preserves with less sweetness.  Or drinking apricot iced tea.  With some floral notes on the finish.  As it cools, a bit more of a Meyer Lemon note creeps in.
* **\*\*Rogue Wave Villa Pastor Pink Bourbon:\*\*** Sample bag.  First Cup.  First time I‚Äôve tasted blueberry in a Colombian coffee.  More like blueberry syrup than the bright blueberry bomb you get from an Ethiopian.  The aroma is very clean.  Bunch of mellow orange acidity to balance out the sweetness.  Medium body.  Orange notes build as it cools.  Blueberry shows up again if I wait a long time between sips.  :)
* **\*\*Rogue Wave Daterra Brazil Full Bloom:\*\*** Sample bag.  First cup.  Milk chocolate covered strawberries, complete with plenty of acidity, with a side of hazelnuts.  Exactly what I HOPE a bean from Brazil will taste like - but with more acidity to balance the sweetness.
* **\*\*94 Celcius FruitoPop: ¬†\*\***Also last full dose.  A little more stone fruit, less berry than when it was fresh and brewed at higher temps.  Tastes Kind of like apricot skin.  But also more sweetness and body.  Sweetness becomes more honeyed as it cools.  Really pleasing cup to sip and savor.

**Ok, long post.  So what‚Äôs the recipe?**

It‚Äôs basically the Coffee Chronicler recipe at 15:1, 85C, 20g beans.  But, I‚Äôve been closing the switch at 35 seconds, then doing the second pour at 45 seconds, and opening the switch at 2 minutes.  Hario tabbed filters.  Virtually no brews have finished before 3 minutes, and none have gone past 3:45 (Ethiopians and Decaf).

0:00 - 150g Circular pour

0:35 - Close Switch

0:45 - Circular Pour to 300g

2:00 - Open Switch, light swirl to settle the bed.

Good to great cups, every time.

I can get more creaminess to the body, tame the acidity, and bump up the sweetness even more by doing a 165g first pour. Not 100% sure why this works yet, as it was an accident when it first happened.  Just not awake and fell into my old continuous pour mode‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôve now tried it on a few beans and it has the same effect.

After 6 weeks of chasing things around, for my overall system of brewer, new grinder, filter, water, technique, and taste preferences, cooler water was the ticket.  I‚Äôm done experimenting with brew methods for a few weeks - just going to enjoy the holidays with a nice assortment of beans.

***Don‚Äôt be afraid to try brewing cooler.  At least once or twice.  Cooler than you feel comfortable brewing.  Especially if you like sweeter, stronger, full-bodied cups.***

This may not work for the higher extraction, tea-like brews, but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm after.  It‚Äôs why I got the Ode Gen 2 Burrs instead of the SSP.  I like full-bodied coffee with mouthfeel.  This recipe finally gives me what I‚Äôm after - every time.  No wasted beans. Even on light roasts.  Will it do well with Sey or TW?  We‚Äôll find out eventually.  :)

I‚Äôve read a few comments that essentially say *‚Äúwith a good process, you won‚Äôt have to adjust the grind very often for any bean‚Äù.*  And also things like ‚Äú*Grind really shouldn‚Äôt matter. The sweet spot should be relatively wide.‚Äù*

And it made sense. It was what I was after.  I was a process engineer by trade. So I have been striving for a repeatable, consistently very good to great cup.   Ironically, it was getting the exact same BAD flavor in every cup that finally alerted me I was *REALLY CLOSE* to having a great brewing process.  I had something repeatable - I just needed to shift the entire process.  Temperature was the lever to make that shift.

Sure; I‚Äôll dial in the grind by a click or three on some coffees, and go hotter on some as well.  But it‚Äôs just nice to know with certainty that this recipe will give me a very good cup and starting point to decide IF anything should change.

I just need the discipline to start here - at the starting point - every time.  To not read what others suggest, to not follow brew guides from the roaster, or think I know what I should do with a new bean.  Just do this recipe first.  But because I KNOW it produces much better than average cups for me, that shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.

Literally, I can‚Äôt recall a better cup of coffee (not counting espresso) that I‚Äôve had anywhere else.  I‚Äôve probably ruined myself on ordering coffee anywhere, unless it‚Äôs a specific bean I want to try.  Or I‚Äôm craving a cappuccino.  Even then I‚Äôm doubting I‚Äôll do it.

***Because for 17 consecutive coffee beans to be truly enjoyable with the exact same recipe?  I‚Äôm just floored.  Honestly.  It‚Äôs the best week of coffee I‚Äôve ever managed to brew.***

it's what I hoped I could get when I bought a new grinder and kettle. When I ordered beans from a bunch of ""better"" roasters.

It may not be the recipe for you, but I know a lot of us tend to chase beans around.  If that‚Äôs you, know that there is a great consistent recipe for you somewhere in that chase.

But YOUR perfect recipe is all part of a consistent system that includes every part of your brewing process.  The last piece for me was the most surprising:  85C water.  That‚Äôs ultimately why I wrote this post.  Hope it helps someone find their ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù recipe and process.",14,1734017229.0,pourover,1,0.94,False

1hcnhwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Storytelling1991/comments/1hcnhwn/title_wife_lies_to_the_police_about_spousal_abuse/,Title: Wife lies to the police about spousal abuse against me to avoid divorce. Now when the truth comes out she is facing the loss of her inheritance.,"Never thought I would be facing this but here i am. I am 36 male married to my wife 34 female. I am sitting in a hotel writing this because I am prepaing for a divorce. Before we get started let's give a little background to set the scene. We have been married since college. A little over 10 years. When we first started dating, things seem so good to be true. I didn't notice any red flags until after we have gotten married. At that point it was my duty as a husband to stand by her. For better or for worse right? Anyway, within two years of our marriage I landed a high paying job at a law firm. Three years later I became an partner at the firm. I decided to surprise my wife and upgrade her wedding ring. I had no idea her initial response, but given the fact that we have been together for a while I thought about her and I wanted to use my bonus to spoil her.
Anyway fast forward to the day I went to pick her up from work.
She was a bit tired but I thought this was normal.
I was standing outside with flowers, her favorite chocolate and the fanciest suit I could wear.
She looks at me in surprise asking what am I doing here.
I opened the door and asked her to get in.
She seemed annoyed but she got in anyway.
Driving off I asked how was her day and she snaps at me.
She then asked why did I come up to her job and explains that I have embarrassed her.
I was taken aback.
Embarrassed her?
I came in a $1000 suit with all the goodies and I have embarrassed her?
How was this possible?
I asked where was this coming from and she suddenly turns and looks out the window.
I say nothing else as I pull into her favorite restaurant.
She looks at me with a look of disgust like I just insulted her great ancestors.
She said that she doesn't want to be here and to take her home.
I tried to reason with her but she wasn't hearing it.
I pulled out the final card while driving home.
I reached into my suit pocket and hand her the box that contained the wing.
She slowly rolls down the window and throws the box out.
I completely lost it.
I asked her did she know what she just did?
She said she threw a box out the window so what was the problem.
I told her first of all that's littering which is a crime and Secondly I just bought her an upgrade wedding ring.
She said that she doesn't need another ring and she really doesn't need me if she is being honest.
I was shocked.
Not only did I spend $10,000 on this ring but I had paid an additional $2,000 to have our names and the date we started our relationship engraved in the inside of the ring.
So a total of $12,000 gone just like that.
It was dark and it was late by this time so I couldn't just pull over to get the ring.
At this point I was so upset that I just drove home in silence.
When we got home, she just went into the house.
No talking or anything.
Just complete silence.
She jumps into the shower and leaves her phone on the dresser.
Now normally I would never go through her phone because I was raised knowing about Pandora's box.
For those who don't know Pandora's box is a Greek myth about a certain jar that contains many sins, troubles and other bad things.
Once you are knowledgeable about this there's no turning back.
Anyway I was going to leave her phone alone until I hear a buzz.
Curiosity got the best of me so I lean over to see a message.
The message says please don't do this.
Now I know my wife's password and she knows mine.
I check the messages and to my dismay I was horrified.
It was her work chat all females.
They were telling her to not do anything stupid to me or it may backfire.
I kept scrolling up and I seen pictures of bruises and scars that my wife sent to the chat.
She said that she is leaving me and if she has to drag me through the mud then so be it.
I was heartbroken.
All these years we were together.
We laughed and cried together.
How could she be plotting such a heinous crime against me?
Anyway I hear the water from the shower turn off and I switch off her phone and run out the room so she won't suspect anything.
I run to the other room and begin to cry.
I cover my mouth so I wouldn't draw attention but I was so hurt.
After a few minutes I gather myself together and I just go to the closet, grab a bag and head to the room where I begin to pack.
She is getting dressed and drying her hair.
She asked me what am I doing.
I said nothing.
She throws a vase that my late mother bought us towards my head and I duck.
It shatters everywhere.
I immediately grab a handful of clothes, and told her that I know what she is doing and it's best that we call things off.
She said that unless I want to go to jail I will stay right here.
I turn to walk away when I hear a scream.
She started hitting herself and blood was everywhere.
I immediately turn to bolt and she grabs me smearing her blood on my shirt.
I was horrified.
Knowing you're about to be set up and watching it unfold is a terrible and traumatic thing to witness.
I finally break free but it's too late.
By the time I got outside the police were there.
One guy who I think was a rookie grabs me and throws me to the ground.
I sprained my wrist during the fall.
Handcuffs are placed on me and my wife is faking tears.
I looked at her asking why would she do this.
She said it's time I pay for my crimes.
The police takes me down to the station where I am booked and placed in the jail cell.
The charge was assault with intent to kill.
Since there was blood on my shirt I was already seen as guilty by the cops.
Since it was the weekend I knew there was no judge so I was in there for the time being.
I called my fellow colleagues, explained the story and they were shocked.
They said to not represent myself.
They would send a lawyer and to keep my head low until Monday.
There were a few situations where I was about to get my ass kicked because word got around that I was some wife beater and the jail has some sort of moral code about women and kids.
Ironic isn't it?
Anyway monday morning comes and I stand before a judge.
Of course I enter in a not guilty please and I was released on bail.
The bail was for $35,000 in total.
That's crazy because even if I did the crime which we all know I didn't I was a first time offender, never even had a speeding ticket.
I never even got in trouble in school.
But to be a first time offender the bail was pretty harsh.
Anyway my firm put up the money and I was released.
I had to go to my home to get my things but was uncertain because I had no idea if my wife was at work or not.
My co worker let's call him Steve 34 male took me to my house.
We drove past my house and my wife's car wasn't there.
I thought she must have went to work and I told him that I don't feel comfortable going alone because she may be there and I just need to grab my bag that I dropped in the living room.
He says that he will walk with me.
We go to the house and I have my keys on me so I go into the house.
I quickly grab my bag and walk out the door.
We go to his car and he asks me what am I going to do now.
I told that I am ok that I will have to take a few days off and that he could drop me off at a nearby hotel.
He agreed and we leave.
We go to a nice hotel and he pays for me to check in for a few days.
After the third day my partners come to my room and ask how do I want to proceed with my wife.
I told them that I want to divorce her as soon as possible.
They opened the briefcase and gave me some papers.
Apparently they already had the secretary draft the paperwork.
They informed me that they will have the magistrate to serve her by lunchtime.
Quickly sign them without hesitation.
Later on in the afternoon I got a phone call.
It was my wife and she had some words for me.
She screamed, she cursed and she said that she is going to make my life a living hell.
I simply hung up and blocked her number.
Later on I got a phone call from a man.
He claims that he works with my wife.
He asked to meet me so I agreed to meet at a neutral location so that I can see what he wanted.
We meet the next day at a coffee shop.
He was reluctant to speak at first but he decided to spill the beans.
He apologized for all that I went through.
He explained that my wife was dealing with something personal and he couldnt share that part.
However he heard in the break room about how my wife was planning to set me up.
Many of the coworkers tried to stop her but she was losing it.
He didn't know how to reach me so he did a background check on me using my name and when he seen the criminal history he knew he found me so he got my number and reached out.
I told him I appreciate it and I asked of he would be willing to testify on my behalf.
He was unsure at first but then he agreed as he felt that this was the right thing to do.
We shake hands and I told him to leave first.
He knew I was on edge so he said goodbye and he left.
I make it back to my hotel and I just sigh.
10 years and it's over just like that.
Later came the trial. My wife knew she was lying and she even put on the waterworks for the jury.
When Steve cross examined her he asked her that if she knew perjury was a crime.
Her lawyer obviously objected and of course it was sustained.
Steve then went on to say that he no longer wants to interview my wife and that he wanted to Introduce a final witness.
The judge allowed it and in walked her coworker.
When I tell you my wife went pale it was like she have seen a ghost.
He approached the stand and he told the court exactly what he heard.
He gave dates, times and locations.
He even mentioned the group chat where he is apart of that he seen her plotting to set me up.
He had screenshots and Steve submitted them into evidence.
The judge reviewed this and he said that this is ridiculous.
He looks at me and he apologized for everything that I went through.
Before he slammed his gavel Steve spoke up and asked that we be granted an Emergency divorce.
The judge asked on what grounds.
Steve went on to say that we had recordings of my wife threatening me after she was served with the divorce papers and that with the current history it would be unwise for this marriage to continue.
The judge signed and granted the divorce on the spot.
We didn't have a prenuptial agreement but she still gets nothing.
Her lawyer was pissed but he just walks out.
My now ex wife was angry and storms out of he courtroom.
We go to celebrate as I am now a free man.
I probably won't ever date or marry again.
However I can finally breath.

Update:
Shortly I filed a lawsuit against the police for wrongful arrest and police brutality.
They decided to settle out of court for a lot of money.
2.5 million dollars to be exact.
So right now I am on cloud nine.
My ex wife was convicted of perjury, false report to the police and conspiracy charges.
Although I didn't want to see her go through that, she has no one to blame but herself. 
This was her Karma.
After the divorce some years later my ex wife reaches out to me.
She just got out of jail after two years for perjury, false report to the police and conspiracy.
She seems calm and asks if we can talk.
I hung up the phone.
She calls back again and she asks if we can meet.
I am still at the hotel and I told her that I will text the address and she can meet there.
We meet 20 miles away from the hotel.
I know I am paranoid at this point.
We sit down and she takes a deep breath.
She apologizes for everything that she has done.
She explains after everything happened her parents found out and she possibly going to lose her inheritance.
Yeah you heard that right.
She came from a rich family and although I am not particularly close with my former in laws they actually like me and they respected how I worked hard for what I have.
I asked her what does that have to do with me.
She went on to explain what actually was going on with her.
Apparently since she was 16 she has been struggling with her sexuality.
She was sent abroad to study after she told her mother that she might be gay.
For years she tried to suppressed it.
Then she met me.
She wanted to tell me so badly but she seen how sweet I was and she thought that she could forget how she feels and move on.
Many years later when she looked in the mirror and didn't recognize who she was. Then she snapped.
I was getting teary eyed at this point.
I asked her why didn't she just tell me.
Why would she try to ruin my life.
If she was honest about it I would be hurt for sure but I wouldn't have judged her.
I would have supported her and helped her with her parents.
She said she regrets it all.
However she needs my help.
Her parents are going to drop her from the will and she will lose the inheritance.
Her parents are old traditional Christians and do not believe in divorce.
She said that if I were to help her that she will share the inheritance with me.
I take a deep breath and asked her didn't she learn anything.
She looks puzzled.
I went on to name the charges that she was just convicted for and one of those was lying before the judge.
Now she wants to lie to her parents.
She looks away and says that I don't understand and I am being selfish because it all worked out for me.
That was the benediction.
I slowly get up and walk away.
I turn around and tell her that I will speak to her parents about the inheritance.
Not because I care for you it's because I pity what you have become, but this is the last thing I will do for you.
I told her to call it a divorce present and after this lose my number and never contact me again.
I walked out of the place and go to my car.
It was a long drive home so I put on some backstreet boys.
That's right I like the backstreet boys sue me.

Update 2:
Ok guys this is my final update and I am uncertain where to start.
It's been a year since I last updated and I have been so busy I forgot.
I talked to her parents and they were upset that I wasn't going to stay with their daughter.
They went on to say that couples fight and that we should make up and move on.
I asked my ex wife's parents if she can get her inheritance.
They said no and they wouldn't budge.
I informed them that I know everything.
How she was gay, how they sent her away, how they played me and accepted my wedding gift of $250,000 knowing their daughters sexuality.
I told them that they owe me and if they didn't give her the damn inheritance then I would take them to civil court and sue them for emotional distress.
I know I didn't have a case but they are a well known family and a lawsuit would be the talk of the town so they said that they will send her the inheritance now and that was over before I knew it.
I hang up the phone and I blew a sigh of relief.
That day I sat down and grabbed a bottle of wine and watch reruns of my favorite TV show on Netflix.
Although single life is kind of new I would rather be single than to trust another woman again after this.
I know all women are not like this but it is best to just focus on work and live my life to the fullest.
Thanks to everyone reading this and I hope that everyone enjoyed this bumpy ride.

I just feel like like has no point, and I wasn't born rich, so I can't afford pleasure all the time. Even if you are rich, you still get sick, lose friends and family, get old, and die.

I was raised religious. Then I watched my mom die when I was in elementary school. No one had any real answers. Even as a kid, ""God has a plan,"" ""she's in a better place now,"" all sounded like bullshit to me.

I guess I kinda got stuck there. The cancer made her lose her mind in the end. Total loss of person hood. She was dead well before she stopped breathing. All because of a tiny ball of cancer in her head.

That was years ago, a lifetime, but I never got past it.

And people talk about hope and ""finding your own meaning,"" but like... look around. Are you kidding? Have you seen the news? Have you talked to your neighbors about what they're going through? Or that homeless guy on the street? How do you think that roadkill felt when it saw that car coming toward it? How can you look at the world and your single ""have a cup of coffee"" moment and think it's all worth it?

The only ""truth"" that's seemed even remotely true to me is that Mr. Peanutbutter quote about finding ""meaningless nonsense"" to fill your time until you're dead. Because that's all we're ever doing. Filling time. Distracting ourselves.

I don't know. I've tried a lot of things. It's getting harder to get up every day. I'm not sure why I should keep trying. I've completely lost the concept of valuing my life. It all feels pointless.",1,1734017032.0,depression,0,1.0,False

1hcnbez,https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/comments/1hcnbez/lets_get_started_beginner_questions_and_answers/,Let's Get Started: Beginner Questions and Answers,"# What Should I Read First?

Obviously, this FAQ is a good start.  Other recommended reading is [The Fat of the Land](http://justmeat.co/docs/the-fat-of-the-land-vilhjalmur-stefansson.pdf) (should be required reading), [Bear's Words of Wisdom](http://justmeat.co/docs/the-bear.pdf) (also pretty important), and [Strong Medicine](http://justmeat.co/docs/strong-medicine-blake-donaldson.pdf) (optional but has some good information).  All three of those are available as PDFs from those links.  They are listed in order of how beneficial they are.  I have rarely seen a question that was not addressed in The Fat of the Land.

# I'm sorry but the idea of a zerocarb diet having book requirements sounds like ultimate gatekeeping to me.

This way of eating has a history and that history defines what it is and how it is done.  When someone has questions, they are usually already answered in those sources.  I did not say that any of the books are  required.  I said one 'should' be required, another was pretty  important, and one was optional.  No one is being forced to do anything.   It helps to read the books.  But, we answer the questions of those who don't.

# How Long Should I Try?

You should commit to a full 30 days and 100 individual meals, whichever is greater.  During this time, absolutely no deviation or cheating allowed.  If you cheat, or deviate, restart both counts.

# Should I Slowly Reduce Carbs or Jump Right In?

Some of the other moderators here often will tell people to go do keto, paleo, or some other low-carb plan first.  I don't agree with them.  But, you can go try that.  Your first day of zerocarb will not start until after you completely drop everything though.  I say to just commit and get through it.  Stefansson (The Fat of the Land) says the same thing.

>Beginning the meat diet gradually, trying to make the change less  painful, would be about as considerate as chopping a dog's tail off  gradually, by inches.  \[. . .\] I have seen to it, irrespective of  this token hoarding, that the men changed abruptly from the mixed to  the straight meat diet, the saved-up delicacies being strictly saved,  never used in any tapering off process.

# What Can't I Eat?

You can't eat anything that isn't from the animal kingdom.  That means no plant foods, no artificial sweeteners (nothing sweet actually), no fiber supplements, no alcohol, and no plant oils/fats.  This includes honey.  Some people confuse themselves into thinking honey is an animal product.  It is not.  It isn't even something debatable.  Honey is not allowed in any amounts in the carnivore/zerocarb way of eating.

# OK, What Can I Eat?

You can have any kind of meat.  You do not need to stick with beef.  If you like pork, eat pork.  If you are craving some chicken, eat some chicken.  The same goes for everything else: rabbit, fish, lamb, etc.  You can eat high-fat and low-carb dairy.  That's butter, hard cheeses, and creams.  Dairy can cause issues for people, it should not be considered a main course.  It is more like a seasoning or a side.  Some cheese on a burger is fine.  An 8 ounce block of cheese by itself?  That is not fine.  Eggs are fine also.

# What About Milk?

Don't drink milk. You are a grownup.  As people age, milk become less and less appropriate for humans. Young children can drink milk.

After you had adapted, if you wish to try to include milk, you can give it a shot.  Some people have no problems and find it benefits them.  But, during the getting started phase, no milk.  And, the majority of people never go back to it.

# Do I Need to Eat My Meat Raw?

Nope.  Cook your meat however you like it.

# Do I Need to Eat Organs or Grass-Finished Meat?

Nope.  Eat the meat you enjoy and can afford.  There is no need to ever eat organs or grass-finished meat.  You really do not need to concern yourself with it when just starting.

# What About Seasonings, Salt, and Spices?

Spices are allowed (although make sure sugar is not an ingredient).  Plants are allowed as seasonings and medicines.  A light sprinkling of some spices will not be a problem for most people, although some people do have issues.  Do not get too aggressive with it, light is better.   Meat is delicious, it does not need much to enhance the flavor.  Salt is something you can consume to taste.  There are people who insist you need extra and others who insist that you need none.  Stefansson says none.  The Bear says none.  Most people feel better with salt, even extra salt, at the start.  It is not a deal breaker.

# What About Electrolytes? You don't mention them and lots of people on the sub talk about them.

It is covered under seasonings and  salt. Short answer, historical practice has considered salt to be  problematic and it was not permitted. People adapted fine and we're  successful without using any salt or electrolytes (even during the  adaptation phase).  Stefansson even refused to take it with him on the long journeys and what little they had ran out at the same time they went from a mixed diet to a zerocarb one cold-turkey.

Lots of people  mention it. Sure. Lots of people believe they need to consume a bunch  and worry about balancing electrolytes. They will insist they had  symptoms that only resolved because they increased salt or added  magnesium or whatever. Or they insist they get certain symptoms if they  cut or reduce these things. It will never cease to amaze me, the  powerful effect that beliefs can have on the body.

In the end, salt is probably not super harmful.  If it makes you feel better and sleep well at night, have some extra salt. It is not a deal breaker.

# What About Coffee or Tea?

Coffee and tea are not good for you.  But, coffee is generally well tolerated and accepted by many.  Stefansson allowed it, the Bear allowed it, and many long-term carnivores will still drink it.  It falls into the category of plants as flavoring and/or drugs.  You can keep it for the start.  If you do, it is highly recommended that you try going without it at some point in the future.  Tea tends to be harder on the kidneys and body.  A cup should be fine.  But, but not too much.

If you drink either, some cream is fine.  Real cream and not creamer.  No sweeteners of any kind.  No butter, no coconut oil or MCTs (plant oils are not allowed).  Absolutely no Bullet-Proof coffee monstrosities.

# What About Alcohol?

No.  Definitely not at the start.  And, it is not a great idea after.  If you can't stop drinking for 30+ days while you get through the 30 days / 100 meals, you have bigger problems with alcohol than you do with your food.  Fix that first.

# How Much Should I Eat / When Should I Eat?

More than you expect and more often than you think.  The absolute minimum recommended amount (from Strong Medicine) is 3 meals a day of 6 ounces of lean and 2 ounces of fat.  That is equivalent to 3x8oz of (75%/25% ground beef).   One and a half pounds over three meals is about 1,995 calories and 109 grams of protein.  This is the FIRM minimum allowed (small women might get prescribed and eat this amount).  Eating more at any of the three meals was allowed.  For larger people more was encouraged.  Eating less than this was failure to follow the protocol.

Ideally, you will attempt to follow a similar eating protocol and plan at the start.

We   strongly discourage intermittent fasting during the first days.  We know that many zerocarbers who have done this for a while will eat 1-2   meals a day, but very few of them started there.  The first purpose of   eating this way is to relearn your body's signals and needs.  You  should  eat when you are hungry and as much as you want.  For people who  have a  history of calories restriction, IF, fasting, or other stuff  like that,  you might have messed up your ability to know when you are  hungry.  Try  and eat several times during the day.  Have at least two  bites of the  food.  If you eat a couple of bites and really aren't  interested, put it  away and come back to it later.  You will often be  shocked to learn  that you were hungry.  This has other benefits.   First, it reduces  cravings for the foods you shouldn't eat.  If you are  full, you are less  likely to fall to temptation.  Second, it provides  ample nutrients for  your body to heal and get back on track.  Third,  you are sending signals  to your body that food is ample and there is no  shortage.  There's no  need to preserve excess fat, energy is available  for the taking whenever  desired.  You may not lose super quickly  eating this way, although many  people do still lose a lot, you will get  healthy and reach a healthy  weight this way.  Remember, you can starve  yourself thin; but, you will  never starve yourself healthy.

Our position on IF is perfectly summed up by The Bear.

>It   is perfectly ok to only eat one large meal/day, like a three pound   steak- but it is likewise just as ok to eat as many as six. If you are   working out and trying to gain muscle mass, eat six smaller steaks   rather than one or two big ones. I have eaten as much as four or five    pounds of steak in a day- and as little as one or two, it matters   not--but if you ingest less calories than you are burning, you will lose   muscle mass as well as bodyfat. If you ingest more than you need, the   body discards the excess--quite different than is the case with carbs.

# I Can't  Eat Enough At My OMAD!

OMAD is a totally different way of eating from carnivore. Let go of that idea and eat multiple times.

There are zerocarbers who end up  eating one huge meal a day, but it is not everyone. Lots of people end  up with two or three meals a day. Some feel best with even more. But the  number of meals does not matter. All of them eat when their body  requests food. All of them eat enough to fuel their body well.

If  you read the above, the minimum amount for starting out should be three  meals of 8 ounces or more of fatty meat. After you have a few months  under your belt and have learned to listen to your body when it asks for  more or is not asking for food, then you can try something else.

# How Will I Poop Without Fiber?

You   will poop again.  It might slow down.  It might speed up.  Do not  trust  a fart.  One frequent adaptation issue is very loose movements.   It's  not uncontrollable diarrhea, but it is very watery.  These things   normalize in time.  But, you will almost never fart.  If you think you   have to fart, try going to the bathroom.  You won't regret that   precaution.

# Do I Need to Take Supplements? What About Medications?

You do not need supplements.  You can continue to take medications prescribed to you.  Be aware that your body may become more sensitive to the medication and require less as time goes on.  Work with your doctor.

# Do I Need to Buy Anything?

You do not need anything to eat this way.  Do not go out and buy ketone strips, glucose monitors, coaching or anything else.  There is no need to pay for any books.  We have the main ones available for free.  There are no supplies you need to buy, other than the meat that you can afford and enjoy.  It is not  wrong to buy someone's book, but you are not going to be more successful because you do.

Be wary of people trying to sell you something.  There is no need to pay $120 a month for coaching.  We provide all the information you need here for free.  Actually, all the best, most experienced, and helpful zerocarbers offer their help for free and are out there.  Many of us have been helping others for years, for free.  You don't need to buy your meats from any specific supplier.  There are no supplements or vitamins that we are selling.  In fact, if anyone offers advice that also includes something you should buy, that is a pretty good sign that you shouldn't trust them.

# Who Do I Trust?

You will frequently see people with different opinions arguing on here.  People will tell you that you need to eat liver, fast, stare at the sun, rub your left foot counterclockwise under a full moon, etc.  Often this advice will be contradictory.  When in doubt, compare that advice to The Fat of the Land, The Bear's Words of Wisdom, and maybe Strong Medicine (if you haven't already got an answer by then).  If none of those address it, chances are it is not that important.  Look for people who have been doing this for a while and what they do, although be careful.  Some people lie about how long they have done it.  Use your common sense and be willing to test things yourself.  Just because we eat this way does not mean we reject all science, common sense, and logic.  Staring at the sun and arguing that the Earth is flat does not make you extra-zerocarb, it makes you extra-special (and not in a good way).

# Will I Get Scurvy?

No.  Read The Fat of the Land for more details.

# Will I Die?

Yes.  You are human, and all humans will eventually die.  But, this diet won't kill you.  This is the diet meant to keep you alive and healthy.  It will not make you immortal.  It won't make you immune from all disease or a super-hero.  It will give your body the best fighting shot at health.

# What If I Have a Special Medical Issue or Condition?

First, always work with your medical professional.  They are aware of your specific situation in a way that people on the internet are not.  For people with histamine issues and other issues with severe allergies, it may require cutting all spices out and seeking fresher meat than normal (start with spices).  People without gallbladders might need to eat more often to avoid overloading on fat.   Some people may find that they react to eggs and dairy and they need to reduce even those down to zero.  If possible, try and complete a run before tweaking, but also be aware of your specific circumstances.

Our  definition of zerocarb is a carnivorous diet.  We only eat meat and  animal products.  We do not consume plants for nutrients or calories.    Some animal products contain carbs (e.g. dairy), most of those are  acceptable.  Some plant products contain no carbs (e.g. plant oils), and  those are generally not acceptable.

Are you interested in trying a carnivore/zerocarb way of eating?  Do you have simple questions about it? There is a weekly simple questions thread that will be pinned under this post and is the best location for that questions.

The  term 'zerocarb' is historical and dates back to Owsley ""The Bear""  Stanley.  While many members choose to also use other terms, like  carnivore, we will always consider ourselves zerocarb.

If  you are really interested in eating this way, you should read ""The Fat  of the Land"" and ""Bear's Words of Wisdom.""  They are both pinned to the  top of the subreddit in the Free PDFs dropdown.  These are considered  required reading.  If you find some person or website promoting advice contrary to the information in those documents (e.g. Saladino), do not be surprised when we delete it.

We do not have a reddit chat, but there is a place if you want a live chat: [u/LogicalLynx](https://www.reddit.com/user/LogicalLynx) runs it on discord: [https://discord.gg/CR9gPvp](https://discord.gg/CR9gPvp)

# Check the [Let's Get Started: Beginner Questions and Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/comments/1hcnbez/lets_get_started_beginner_questions_and_answers/) FAQ Thread for how to get started.

# Purpose

This subreddit exists to:

* provide information about the zerocarb way of eating
* provide support for those eating zerocarb and those who want to try or are trying, to eat zerocarb
* provide a community for zerocarbers to interact and share experiences

We are **not**  a debate subreddit.  There are plenty of places for you to discuss the  health benefits of consuming plants.  This is not the place.  We have  heard it all before.  If you are not on a zerocarb diet or transitioning  to one, you are not guaranteed a right to participate here.  Yes, that  means we reserve the right to ban people just for being vegans,  vegetarians, or bots (which don't eat and thus aren't zerocarb). If you  are veg\*n, you may only post in threads tagged ""VEG\*NS ALLOWED.""  If you  post elsewhere, you can be banned.

We do not offer medical advice.  If you are asking for medical advice, your post will be removed.  If you are giving medical advice, your post will be removed.

The  focus of this subreddit is on eating an all-animal-products diet.  Conversations about unrelated topics may be deleted as they are not  appropriate here.  Conversations about other ways of eating, even  conversations about how those ways of eating are misguided, are not  appropriate here.  It is not the purpose of this subreddit to attack or  mock other ways of eating.

This subreddit makes the assumption that you are an intelligent adult and capable of making your own health choices.  We are wary of making recommendations towards children and teens.  If you are interested in an all-meat diet for your child or you are a teen who is interested, we encourage you to work directly with a medical professional.

If you are interested in a meat-heavy diet, one which is almost carnivore but includes some plant foods, which don't cause you issues, *this is not the appropriate place to have those conversations.*  If this describes you, you may have your right to post removed.  There are two potential subreddits that were created to host those discussions.  We have r/carnivorish and r/dirtycarnivores.  Those subreddits are currently small, but you can help them grow.  A responsible person who helps those subreddits become thriving communities will be considered for a moderator position there.

There are  lifestyle choices that you may believe are related to eating this way,  but there is nothing universal here except the avoidance of plant foods.   Those discussions are best when held in subreddits that are  appropriate for them.

# We are not an extreme weight loss subreddit

Weight  normalization will happen with zerocarb.  If you are overweight, you  will reach a healthy weight.  If you are underweight, you will also  reach a healthy weight.   Weight normalization is just a symptom of the  primary goal.  We are about long-term health and wellness.  This isn't  ""extreme keto"" where you get double your weight loss for extreme carb  denial.

We discourage messages  advocating or encouraging food and calorie restriction, even subtle  messages of this manner.  Do not tell people they need to eat less.  Do  not tell people they are eating too much.  Don't tell people they gained  weight because they ate too much or lost weight because they were  eating less.  Don't tell people to eat leaner meat or try fasting.  This is not a debatable subject.  We don't host CICO  discussions here.

From the Bear's Thread:

>I do advise however, that fasting and severely low caloric intake is NOT a very good idea for your health.\[. . .\]The  meat regime does not require fasting, which is what 1100 cal/day is.  You can eat 5000 cal/day and lose bodyfat. You are eating far too  little. Eat 80% (cal) in fat, 20% (cal) in lean. This is instinctive.  Don‚Äôt measure. Choose a nice fatty cut of meat, cook very little (blood  rare or bleu), eat mostly of the fat at first, until you don‚Äôt feel like  any more fat (built-in response), then eat the lean until satiated.  Save any left-overs in the fridge for later.‚ÄòDieting‚Äô by measuring fat and lean, and restricting caloric intake DOES NOT WORK as a way to acquire and keep a normal body.\[ . . .\]Calorie restriction and/or ‚Äòpartial fasting‚Äô are neither necessary nor desirable.

# We are our own Zerocarb Group

We are a cousin to the Facebook groups: [Zeroing In On Health](https://www.facebook.com/groups/zioh2/), [Zero Carb Health](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ZeroCarbHealth/), [Principia Carnivora](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PrincipiaCarnivora/), and [World Carnivore Tribe](https://www.facebook.com/groups/163527891074530/).    But, we are not a direct offshoot of these and exist in our own  right. Many of us are members of one or more of the facebook groups or  other zerocarb groups.  You are encouraged to join other groups that  interest you.  Do not try and argue that we should run our subreddit  differently because these groups may run themselves differently.  We  know that some groups permit discussions that we don't allow here.   Other reddit groups that are distinct but related to ours include r/CarnivoreForum and  [r/carnivore](https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivore/).

# Rules and Behavior

Make yourself familiar with our rules.  The rules are listed in the sidebar of the new reddit.  There are rules listed on the old reddit style, but they are not updated and may not reflect the current rules.  If there is a conflict in the rules, the ones listed on the new reddit are the correct rules.  You are responsible for reading those rules and following them.  Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse for breaking them.

We are pro-health.  That includes sexual health.  Posts which discourage healthy activities, including healthy sexual activities, are not appropriate here.

We usually hand approve all video posts, watching them first.  A video that includes advice or content that is not allowed here will not be approved.  If a video is long, it can take a much longer time to get reviewed.  At times, with heavy moderation loads, we can remove videos without reviewing them first.  Our default reaction is to remove a video, not approve one.

Breaking  any of the above could result in getting your post deleted, future  posts being manually reviewed, and/or being banned from the subreddit.   Using **bold** in your posts is  disallowed by a historical rule.  Breaking this rule usually only  results in our asking you to edit it and remove the bold.   Your posts  can also be removed if they make it obvious that you didn't read this  post first.  ***Please  report posts that you think might violate rules.  The mods don't always  see everything, and we rely on you to alert us to things that we miss.***

# Debatable Subjects

There are some discussion topics where we hold varied opinions.  These include, but are not limited to:

* coffee, tea, and other beverages *\[generally permitted by most\]*
* artificial sweeteners *\[generally not permitted\]*
* salt, spices, and seasonings *\[generally permitted by most\]*
* intermittent fasting and meal timing *\[accepted when it is natural, discouraged when it is artificial and forced\]*
* occasional use of plant oils (like in a mayonnaise) *\[bad stuff, and the least possible amount is the best\]*
* eggs and dairy *\[most people tolerate these well, but they are the first things we think of when people have problems\]*
* organ meats and liver *\[some swear by them, but many people never eat them and are healthy\]*
* grass fed meat or grain finished meat *\[the biggest issue here should be about animal treatment, as the nutritional value of the two categories is insignificant with the amounts we eat\]*

You  will find that many people end up on different sides of the argument  about these.  The *\[text\]* describes the default position of most people.  But, almost all of us would agree that this is arguing  about the last couple percentage points of perfection.  Eating meat (avoiding plant foods) and drinking water gets a person 98% of the way  there.  If spices and cheese help you stick to just eating meat, you're  better off having them than giving up entirely.  In general, we ask that you refrain from suggesting that something from this list is necessary for success.  And, we certainly don't want you telling people to engage in those things were are generally discouraged.

It should be noted that honey is not an animal food.  It is absolutely not tolerated here.  Recommending honey, in any amounts, or trying to argue that it should be permitted will cause the posts to be removed and even first infractions can result in loss of posting privileges.

We  welcome experience reports, even if you struggled or failed.  We  encourage people to try this out and give it a shot.  But, there is a difference between talking about how you're going to try it and asking us how to incorporate plants back into your diet after that trial up.  Trying it and then evaluating is one  thing.   We aren't going to help you plan plant consumption.  Participate here, while you try it.  If your first post is to tell use that you have done it for six months and your left foot exploded and leaked butter all over your couch, you will find us a bit skeptical as to the veracity of your tale.  We don't need you posting ""Goodbye"" posts.

# My post was deleted or doesn't show up

We  get a lot of hate and a bunch of spam here.  If your post doesn't show  up or gets caught in a filter, and you believe this is in error,  feel  free to message the moderators.  If you spot abusive or off-topic posts,  please report them and we will get on top of them as soon as possible.

There is a certain account age and karma, below which your posts will automatically be removed.  We don't post specific numbers, to discourage people from attempting to find ways around them.  Attempting to get around these limitations can result in your account permanently being filtered.  What we will say is that the numbers are not very high and if you participate positively on other subreddits for a couple weeks, you should be fine.

If  you disagree with a post being deleted, you can message the mods and  try and have a reasonable conversation with us.  We allow some moderator  discretion when it comes to approving and deleting posts.  Having an attitude or attacking the moderators will not help you.  It is likely to make us decide against you, and might result in loss of posting privileges here.  Please note the right for moderators to use discretion.  If we do not allow your post, but we did allow a similar post, that does not mean we have an obligation to approve your post. We make no apologies for heavy-handed moderation.  This is a very specific way of eating.  When people try and dilute or change the way we do things, we are not obligated to provide them an area on this subreddit to promote their variations.",5,1734016590.0,zerocarb,0,1.0,False

For those not in the loop, someone posted [this commissioned piece of art of their pilot](https://www.reddit.com/r/LancerRPG/comments/1hah2wu/amon_callsign_lucifer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and appropriately tagged it NSFW. People have since clutched pearls about how it 'doesn't relate to lancer' or is 'just porn' or 'should be on a furry subreddit'. Not stopping at complaining in just this thread, they have since spread to other threads to complain there too.

What makes something qualify as pilot art or not? Put simply, if someone posts a character and says that's their pilot, it's pilot art. The crucial factor in this is that the poster in question is acting in good faith. Trying to get snarky about it by posting random shit and claiming it is your pilot is acting in bad faith and you will be banned for it.

If you scroll through some of the pilot art posted on this subreddit, you'll find that most are not immediately identifiable as Lancers. Standing next to a frame from the book, wearing something branded with the settings logos will do it, but that is not universal nor can we make 'Your pilot must be holding a GMS branded Standard Pattern 3 Coffee Mug' a reasonable requirement for pilot art. The poster's word, in good faith, is the only surefire way to determine that a character is a Lancer character.

It is ultimately rather telling that out of all pieces of pilot art, it is a gender-nonconforming anthropomorphic goat that triggered this severe of a response from a lot of people.  To make it blatantly clear, this kind of hatred for an innocuous subculture is a bannable offense under rule 1.

As for the canonicity of anthropomorphic characters and extensive biomodding within Lancer's setting, I frankly do not care. Lancer is not a setting particularly concerned with hard canon. It's a TTRPG. The canon will differ from table to table. I'm going to quote a section from the core rulebook here, page 337 in the paid GM version or page 6 of the free version:

>At the risk of enacting further violence by depicting

>worlds and cultures where there are regressive or

>discriminatory stances on gender baked-in, we have

>decided not to codify in the rules how players may

>express themselves ‚Äì please do note that this

>absence of canonical definition is absolutely not

>meant to be read as exclusion, but is meant instead

>to avoid flattening all possible stories into one

>‚Äúcanon‚Äù definition of what it means to be gendered,

>transgender, nonbinary ‚Äì to have a body in Lancer.

We live on a primarily wooded 11 acre property. We have about 1 acre of grass (1/2-2/3 acres being converted to native grass) leaving us with just the yard around the house and barn that we mulch and vac the leafs from due to the shear density we have, ~15-20 trees in this area. 

Therefore I have a massive pile of these mulched leafs (15ftx15ftx4ft) that I'm trying to do something useful with. We have started collecting our coffee grounds, and any natural grown food scraps (veggie scraps primarily) and I've been tossing them in once a week or every other and give that area a quick toss.

1hcmxsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectors/comments/1hcmxsm/ls800_120_nothing_black_alr_setup/,"LS800 +120"" Nothing Black ALR setup","Hi all, I figured I would share my setup and thoughts on it. I got a projector in general because we sit \~15' from the TV and I wanted at least a little immersion from the TV.  I got the Epson LS800 because I wasn't willing to risk inadequate light output in the lit room in hopes of getting better black levels.  I think I chose correctly, for me at least.  The black levels are indeed quite awful on the wall in a dark room, but much less objectionable once I got the ALR screen up.  And I can turn on all the lights during the day with sunlight streaming in windows and contrast is fine for anything but dark movies and quite bright when watching football and the like. It also probably helps that the setup is on the north end of the house so sunlight is indirect.  In the dark, I find the contrast quite good with good shadow detail, despite nominally poor black levels. It maybe helps I've never seen higher contrast projector in person and the old 70"" tv from 2015 I replaced had similar brightness, contrast, black levels so picture quality doesn't feel like a downgrade, and size is its own picture quality. About the screen, supposedly this is one of the easiest ones to assemble, but it took me 4 hours with lots of sweating and it still has a small crease in the top center (if you have ideas how to fix that I'm all ears, I don't think I got the tensioning wrong, I think the frame you screw on at the end is actually poking into the screen a bit where there is a seam at the top center. The distortion is that the top of image is triangular with the top of the triangle exactly at the seam between between the frame pieces.)  I also was quite careful with the wall placement but still ended up 1-2"" too low, so I have to budget a half hour to fix that at some point and live with a \~116"" image for now. I recommend getting a floor rising model to avoid these headaches if you can afford the 2x price.

I love the projector table, which was suggested in another thread here and is perfect for this: [https://www.castlery.com/us/products/peri-coffee-table?ccid=20865424069&gad\_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAsOq6BhDuARIsAGQ4-zgvb-fn-UuPwqGxyYPNgn8ecCpj6uw9pqXJ\_LNLJPdxnYaCB-6c5TwaAmDpEALw\_wcB](https://www.castlery.com/us/products/peri-coffee-table?ccid=20865424069&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAsOq6BhDuARIsAGQ4-zgvb-fn-UuPwqGxyYPNgn8ecCpj6uw9pqXJ_LNLJPdxnYaCB-6c5TwaAmDpEALw_wcB)

FYI, the images are different sizes in the photos because for one I used the app to fix the top center distortion, but it shrinks the image substantially, so I reverted to an uncorrected image and just live with the distortion for now, which is pretty minor unless you fixate on it.

I love coffee (big surprise I know), but I have some trouble sleeping and also very light sleeper, so I don't like drinking caffeinated coffee after noon. 
I tried a ton of different decafs, from supermarket and also from specialty roasters. While the specialty is certainly much better, it still has that definite off taste. I don't know how to describe it properly, but it is very distinct and strong (at least to me), I just call it decaf-flavor.
This was the reason why I really wanted to try the decaf project, to see which decaf process results in the best flavor overall. I compared all decaf options to the caffeinated, and then I also compared all the decaf to each other.

All the decafs taste significantly different from the non-decaf, and to be honest all of them had that same decaf flavour. I was surprised a bit, even when comparing the decafs to each other, there were very little difference. I expected more difference, since the decaf processes are completely different 

Anyone had similar experiences? Does everyone else senses that definite decaf flavour? Also, what exactly causes it? The chemical changes due to the decaf process? Or the lack of caffeine changes the flavour that much? I'm curious what others have tasted.",7,1734015475.0,JamesHoffmann,8,0.82,False

I suppose with their income they won't feel any pain when a plate of caipeng increased from $3.50 to $4.50, or when the price of 30 eggs increased by $2. Hence, how much relief do they think they're providing when determining the amount to hand out?

I just returned from a trip to Malaysia. When I was growing up there, I would only spend on the cheapest meal in the school canteen, which was RM1.50; I wouldn't go to another place because a plate would cost RM0.50 more. Now that I am earning SGD, I feel that I am out of touch with the prices there. Yes, the price of my favourite noodle has gone up by 3-4 times over the last 20+ years. But on the other hand, taking a 15-minute Grab car ride from my parents' place to the airport costs less than RM9 (could be half of what it was with a regular taxi years ago), which is about the cost of the noodle and a drink at a typical coffee shop. I have peers who are driving for Grab there, but I can only imagine how much they take home before all the expenses and mortgage. After the rides, I would happily tip the driver RM3 if it was a great journey because it's less than SGD1 here.

So, I imagine putting myself in the shoes of those people who decide how much to give out (except that they are not merely earning more than 3X what I am earning), do they really feel for people who face real struggles with living expenses?

This is a throwaway, btw.
 
Two weeks ago, I meet a cute 21f on bumble. We went on four dates already, and I can't help but feel kinda lost.
 
She is my second date ever, I don't have any dating experience, especially not for OLD.
 
For our first date we went to a coffee shop, talked and drank some hot chocolate and later went to the Christmas fair where I offered her my arm, and we drank some ""Christmas"" drinks (name I forgot) and walked around arm in arm. I liked it, and so seemed she.
 
Second date we went to play pool, we both were terrible lol but after it, we talked a bit, I put my arm around her, and we shared a kiss in the parking lot at the end of it.
 
Third date we went to the cinema with a terrible movie for a date (conclave) but we laughed it off as we both didn't know what it was really about at the moment.
 
Yesterday we went to play pool again and it felt‚Ä¶slightly less connected? I'm not sure, but we kissed as we greeted each other like we always did ever since the second date, but I feel like I'm the only one who really tries to initiate some form of physical contact (Not creepy groping or smth like that) like subtle nudging or putting my arm around her.
 
I asked her if she was okay with it and if I make her uncomfortable to please tell me, but she said she likes it.
 
Is it simply that men are mostly supposed to initiate that ""touchyness""?
 
Am I moving too quick / expecting too much for our timeframe?
 
What should be my next moves?
 
She's not a big texter either, so I can't help but overthink a lot about this.
 
She's super cute, and I really don't want to fumble this :(

I do not have trust nor daddy issues. I know my shit. I don't smoke. Drink only occasionally. Coffee and tea are necessary. Friends say I am hilarious but quite sassy.

Make yourself known. I am so tired waiting and looking for you. I am here. I am ready.

I recently got a Mara x. The portafilter basket that was on it in the box was giving me around 9 bars. I was using 18g coffee, but I felt there was no room to do wdt, level and tamp. I would get a lot of coffee bean grind on my workstation. I saw the original basket was 14-18g and thought that was the reason since I was near max. I changed it to 18-21g basket and don‚Äôt have that issue of excess coffee bean grind, but now pressure dropped to 6-7. So I would like to know if I should go back to the other basket and do like 17g or is there a way to still do 18g on the bigger basket and get back up to pressure.",2,1734014659.0,Lelit,2,1.0,False
1hcmkiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1hcmkiv/improving_sperm_quality_from_fail_to_normal_in_3/,Improving sperm quality: from FAIL to NORMAL in 3 months,"At the very beginning of our IVF journey early last year, my husband (39 years old at the time) did a sperm analysis for the first time.  We were completely shocked at his results: nearly a ***FAIL*** on every single category (morphology, motility, count, volume, etc).

## Back then (early Spring 2023):

His **lifestyle**: no smoking cigarettes, drinking maybe 4 beers a week, two to three cups of coffee/day, taking a marijuana edible 3x per week, no rigorous exercising but would go on long walks almost daily.  
His **health**: pretty average 'modestly healthy' guy, very slender physique, would try to eat some vegetables every day, would occasionally share dessert with me weekly.  
His **mental health**: really, REALLY bad.  His mother passed away several months prior and it completely wrecked him.  He also quit a nightmare job situation but had trauma/nightmares for many months afterwards.

After a very poor egg retrieval on my part, our doctor recommended we take two/three months off in an attempt to improve our health before the next egg retrieval.  She recommended some supplements/vitamins, and increasing our exercising.  The recommendations were the same for both of us, with the exception of adding zinc to his supplements.

**Here are the DAILY changes we incorporated** (""Ours"" to signify changes we made from our own research)

1. Vitamin D
2. Astaxanthin
3. Fish oil
4. Zinc  (just him, not me)
5. Coq10 / Ubiquinol
6. Folate
7. Melatonin  (turns out melatonin is an antioxidant!)
8. Increase intake of vegetables
9. Shilajit  (can be purchased easily on Amazon. You can google the research on sperm trials.) (ours)
10. Ashwagandha  (easy to find on Amazon) (ours)
11. Cutting caffeine to one or two cups daily (this kind of broke him, LOL) (ours)
12. Cutting alcohol to one beer a week, but sometimes none. (ours)  On a single occasion he got drunk, LOL.
13. Cutting marijuana (ours)
14. Exercising slightly more, by bicycling

## Results 
Three months later, we went back to the clinic, where we did another (and ultimately many more) round of egg retrieval and IVF.  **This time, his sperm was NORMAL on nearly every single category!!**  Only one other category was borderline normal, but I forget which.

Sadly, my egg quality didn't change (I learned from another famous IVF doctor that there's currently *no scientifically guaranteed* way to improve egg quality, unlike sperm), but it was very nice to see improvement on all categories.

He kept most of the lifestyle up for the following months, froze 4 vials of sperm, and gradually, after multiple failed cycles due to poor egg quality, we eased back on his restrictions. He drinks at most 3 beers a week, drinks 2 or 3 cups of coffee a day.  He consumes a little bit of THC weekly, sometimes 2x a week. The supplements are still the same to this day.    
  
The last time we tested his sperm a few months ago, it was still a **NORMAL** on nearly every single category.

Spent half of my life in arts & design and the future seems so bleak. Job market is crazy and I don't have a good portfolio and job resume.

But besides that I don't feel so bad. I just want to work hard and make some okay to good money. 

The only reason I need money for is a nicely lit, cozy place to live, books and coffee. I don't want to have kids or family. I already went to therapy, I like my life of books, art and it's okay if that's the thing I have to do in the spare time. 

My life will always be reading and listening to music regardless of what I do. 

Through therapy I discovered I really like helping people. I also don't mind solitude (if I was good with driving I would drive trucks lol). 

The problem is I have no idea what to do and it feels impossible to find a good job without degree... I am from Europe, I have a design degree. I would love to pick another country but everything feels unreachable. I would really love to live in US but that feels even more impossible.

March: Lucy gets in a car crash on the way to class. Mike is sympathetic to her. A week later, Lucy spills coffee over her desk in class, he helped her clean her desk. Their relationship is likely more distant., He has super annoyed when he wants to talk to another girl alone and Lucy comes. 

April: Lucy distances herself, but she still tries to be friendly to him. Luke is still a bit standoffish.

Ok so MOH yung ate ko sa kasal ko and she lives abroad. Wala naman ako choice nagiisang babaeng kapatid but to keep her in the loop, I ask for suggestions pa rin naman from time to time for my wedding.

Kaso napapansin ko na lahat ng gusto ko ayaw niya. May mga times na nagsshare lang ako cause desidido na ko sa gusto namin ng partner ko. Nagsisimula palang kami ng wedding plans ang dami na niyang negative input. Yung menu namin ng partner ko, yung budget namin, yung cake design etc lahat nalang for her kinokontra niya. I.E. 1. Medyo malaki budget namin ni fianc√© per plate since konti lang visitors. Gusto namin yung medyo pricier menu kasi fave namin lamb and salmon but marami namang ibang  food choices don for those na ayaw non. Shinare ko lang sa kanya cause nacurious siya abt menu. Naknamputa hanggang ngayon pinipilit niya yung pinakamurang menu. E ayaw nga namin ng baboy ano ba!!!  Hanggang sa ginagaslight na ko na yung per plate namin masyado daw mahal. Akala mo siya magbabayad!!! Makikikain lang siya. 2. Gusto niya ung mga bridesmaids ko pagbawalan kong magsuot ng lace kasi maglalace daw siya. Iniba ko na color niya cause i know she‚Äôd want to stand out. Shoulder ng bridesmaids yung gown nila and everything else kami. Personally wala naman akong pake ano suot nila as long as they follow the color. Imessage ko daw na mag plain lang silang damit. 3. Medyo natuto na ko. Di na ko nanghihingi suggestions. Kaso siya naman tong nagtatanong ano plano ko. Yung cake na gusto ko, ayaw niya. Pati flavor diniktahan na ko. Dapat daw strawberry kasi favorite nila yon. Last straw ko na tong plano ko sa cocktail hour. Plano ko kasi maglagay coffee and snacks kasi ako mismo nahahangry pag gutom kakahintay. Aba mag coffee corner nalang daw ako wag na magsnacks. Nung sinabi kong gusto kong may option yung bisita, aba hahahaha nag comment ng sarcastic. Pakaininin ko daw marami during cocktail para di na kumain during dinner. Hahahahaha 4. Other little bullshit like, imove ko daw yung kasal ko para makapunta sila ng pamangkin ko bcs di makaabsent. Gawin ko daw little bride ung pamangkin ko kahit na ayaw kong may little bride. Magrent daw ako ng Yaya Etc etc

At this point. Nawawalan na kong ganang kausapin siya hahahaa nagsisimula palang kami ng plano. Naiirita na ko. Pero syempre kapatid ko and ayoko na ng wedding drama. Bakit ba may mga taong pati special day mo dinodominate nila? Hindi ba pwedeng ako nalang muna ang bida for today‚Äôs video? If gusto niya bakit di nalang siya gumastos at magpakasal para magawa niya yung iniimpose niya sa kasal ko. Iba naman kasi ang suggestion sa dictatorship. Yun lang. 

Kami ni fianc√© magshoulder ng wedding namin so naisstress ako swear hahahaha alam ko naman na she‚Äôs only trying to help and being caring but nakakainis kasi yung approach niya. Nag ‚ÄúLol‚Äù pa siya sa lahat ng ideas ko pag di niya gusto. ",1,1734014188.0,OffMyChestPH,10,1.0,False

1hcm6vj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hcm6vj,Fae offerings/presence.  Excited but curious - FYI LONG post,"Lengthy post: November was a month full of tons of spiritual attacks and endless negative energies. On the New Moon, I took nearly all of my supplies (my altar, altar cloth, tarot decks, all crystals and rocks, wand, cauldron and my person offerings left on my altar permanently), as I placing everything outside in the moonlight I apologized to everything for the weight it was carrying and that it could now release and recharge.  I fully smudged my bedroom and myself and set deep intentions of releasing anything holding me back, practice mindfulness, take ownership of my own mistakes and carefully allow only positive energies either from people or places into my life. I was feeling so much better. And then I began to feel it. First, I do want to state that I have and always have had, a very very deep and strong connection to nature and all things natural. I have always been sensitive to ""energies"" ""vibes"" ""aura""...I have always attributed that to my trauma lol.  But, I am beginning to believe that I am an open vessel or a pourus sponge and that I am more in tune with the vibrations, energies and endless connections around and in us. Okay, moving on. 

I have next to no knowledge about the Fae or the beliefs and Magick around working with them. But one day I began to feel a presence and somehow I just knew that it was the Fae. I could feel all of the beings around me and it began to put me on edge. I even stopped going outside because I was so uncomfortable. I reached out to a few fb groups I'm involved in and really didn't get much back in the form of advice, education, tips etc.  I tried to ignore the feelings. But it seemed to just become heavier and more constrictive. I enjoy cleaning. It helps me calm my mind and allows me to let my brain process whatever it is dealing with because cleaning does not involve much thinking, I am able to sort of ""go offline"". I was cleaning the other night and, I in all honesty...I had not thought about anything like this, had not done any form of research, had not seen anything online related to it in any way, but out of nowhere, I can't call it a whim because it didn't feel like that...it was more of just a task that needed to be attended to at that moment. But I began to make a simmer pot. And I was very mindful and introspective as I was doing so. I added the usually orange and tangerine peels, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves...but then I grabbed my container of dried flowers without thought. Just as I was opening it, I was smacked in the face with the fact that I was subconsciously making an offering. I had been thinking about all things positive and progressive, peace and harmony in my home and Repelling all things negative. So without conscious thought I had begun to to make an offering of goodwill to the Fae. Again, I have no knowledge of anything about Fae, Fairies etc. All I knew is that it felt right  and I trust my intuition very much. So, I just went with it. 

The next day, I wanted to make a true offering in full intent of goodwill and respect. I did some deep dive research and began my offering.  So, I have no chill and really wanted to express my authentic gratitude and intentions...plus I did kind of want to show off and impress them lol. The offerings are placed on my altar which was cleansed and charged under the New Moon. Offerings included: cuttings from my beloved Monstera, some bread, adorable little beads and some pretty costume jewellery pieces. A feather,  burnt simmer pot, blueberries, honey, moon, water, two spoonfuls of soil from mama Monstera, pea gravel that I thought was really pretty, rosemary seeds which are precious to me, white sage seeds which are also precious to me, the last little bit of white sage that I had , some organic black tea leaves, a piece of tiramisu, thyme and a handmade ring that I bought that I loved but it began to break and it has only one gemstone left. Lol go big or go home. I placed some plants around my altar, and I know that they do not like to be watched or seen so I placed a chair and piece of cardboard against the balcony railing for their privacy. I gave my gratitude and goodwill welcoming. I informed them that I would leave the balcony door unlocked and offered them sanctuary from the cold amongst my houseplants.  I closed the curtains to ensure that I did not look back at the offering. 

I went to my bedroom and was doing something on my phone when I saw a glimmer streak out the corner of my eye. I looked up thinking it was a bug, but then another glimmer streaked out the corner of my eye on the other side. I felt in that moment that they had accepted my offering and invitation. I went back to my phone and a few more glimmers went streaking by. I didn't bother trying to see anything, I  just sat back and smiled. I felt fully content with a sense of ""fullness"" but of almost like every pore had absorbed some air. And I slept wonderfully. This morning I was making my coffee and before I poured my creamer, I offered them the first bit. I put some in a little plastic cup, put it next to my fiddle leaf fig plant, a few pretty stones around and two tea candles that I lit, offered gratitude again and let the candles burn until out. 

Oof I know....so much. But, that is the whole of it. I do not know if I did anything wrong, offensive, dangerous, and if I'm just wanting to believe that they accepted my invitation. If you read this all the way through, bless you. Any advice, information, guidance, constructive criticism, etc. welcome and desired. Thank you all.  
Blessed be.

1hcm4te,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticPeeps/comments/1hcm4te/my_therapist_is_self_diagnosed_autistic_and_were/,My therapist is self diagnosed autistic and we‚Äôre having problems ,"I am formally diagnosed with autism. I‚Äôve had a really hard time finding therapists who are the right fit for me, since I started in therapy in childhood. I have endured a lot of trauma from therapists too. Then I became one to try to do better but I got sick and had to leave the field after a couple of years. Now because of my background I am much more critical of therapists and struggle to know what to look past and what is okay to be critical of.

When I met my therapist, she told me in intake she had ADHD and ‚Äúa touch of the ‚Äòtism‚Äù and was ‚Äúneurospicy‚Äù. Obviously this grossed me out but I took it like she was trying to be relatable bc she‚Äôs a few years older than me.

My therapist has done a good job of acknowledging that her experience differs from mine and I struggle in ways she doesn‚Äôt. I previously posted in here about that. But there are other issues.

Her communication is super vague. She can be direct sometimes and vague at other points. I often don‚Äôt know what she means and have to ask for clarification. She seems to process information and communicate in what is called ‚Äútop down‚Äù. So she will throw out main points / ideas to me, and I will feel overwhelmed.

To provide an example of this, last week she suggested I think about doing an activity. All she said is you get a backpack and put rocks in it. You label the rocks with things weighing you down. I get the activity is metaphorical, and I do understand metaphors because they were drilled into me in school. But I don‚Äôt think in them. My brain doesn‚Äôt work that way. Being autistic, I can‚Äôt get past the why of this activity. How is something like that supposed to make me feel better? I process my emotions, speak about how I feel, and I still don‚Äôt find the stress releases itself from my body.

When I think about doing something like that I‚Äôd need to know way more about it. I‚Äôd want to read a hand out and see very detailed steps to the process. I‚Äôd want to read about others experiences with the activity too. I don‚Äôt even get what goes on the rocks. I am like this with most activities and demands in my life because well, I have autism.

I can think in top down sometimes because I also have ADHD. But my brain mostly works in bottom up. I look at details and synthesize and analyze them. It‚Äôs very hard for me to get to the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù and takes a long time. This makes my life hard and especially makes social interaction confusing, and even most workplaces don‚Äôt know how to accommodate me when they‚Äôve given me tasks previously. Like one time I had a boss ask me to do a presentation and I had questions. She just said ‚Äúdo whatever you want‚Äù and I ended up quitting because that didn‚Äôt work for me. I needed structure and support, just like I had with rubrics and such when I was in school.

I confronted my therapist via text about a few things that didn‚Äôt feel right about our last session. I didn‚Äôt feel well after it and still don‚Äôt. She did reply mostly respectfully and wanting to do better, which I appreciate. But she said she needs ‚Äúvisual reminders‚Äù from me, which I have no idea what that means. I did ask her what that means. I also have aphantasia and she processes information visually. So we have opposing cognitive profiles in that regard.

She admitted she communicates via tone and inflection and has noticed this doesn‚Äôt work with some loved ones + other ND clients she has with ‚Äúdiffering presentations‚Äù than her. I‚Äôm just confused as to why someone who thinks they‚Äôre autistic would communicate indirectly, in a way I do not understand. I am shocked I had to tell her I can‚Äôt read those cues. I thought it was obvious because of my autism diagnosis.

An example of this was I was talking about my relationship issues. And I said something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why he treated me that way.‚Äù She just said ‚ÄúI think you know why‚Äù with lots of tone, eye stuff, and body language that made no sense to me. I actually don‚Äôt know why lol, that‚Äôs why I said it. I communicate directly.. because I have autism.

I have not seen a single autistic trait in her. In fact she runs late for sessions and we had to talk about that too because her lateness pattern varied. Sometimes it was 3-5 minutes, sometimes more. Sometimes she would text she would be late, other times she didn‚Äôt. The lack of consistency and predictability in her as a person doesn‚Äôt align with autism, I don‚Äôt think. I don‚Äôt even think she had a solid morning routine because one time she was late due to making coffee.

I try to meet in the middle with people and be less critical. I didn‚Äôt ask her to be on time, just to try to communicate if she‚Äôll be late and provide more predictability. She did say she‚Äôll try to be on time but she‚Äôs been late for all 5 times we‚Äôve met so far.

I actually brought the lateness issue to the NDM space to ask about it. Because it‚Äôs been programmed into me that it‚Äôs ableist to ask people to be on time. After going there, I actually was surprised to not get that response. I know this sub is the opposite of that but I will say a lot of AuDHD clinicians over there felt being on time is really important, as is communication around lateness that may happen for a valid reason, like a client emergency.

There were a few people who said they will run late and clients like me activate them so we‚Äôre not a fit. I was a bit nervous my therapist would respond that way bc a previous therapist did when I confronted her lateness, but I‚Äôm at least glad that didn‚Äôt happen.

TLDR: I don‚Äôt really think my therapist is autistic and I think because she‚Äôs probably just allistic ADHD, and I‚Äôm autistic, we‚Äôre having issues with communication and rapport building in sessions. I also think her self diagnosis can be an issue because she has assumed relating to autistic people + clients is an indicator of having autism. But I will be fair and say she is working on some things I‚Äôve brought up to her. I just feel annoyed.",14,1734013293.0,AutisticPeeps,18,0.94,False

I‚Äôm raising money to fund necessary treatments and pursue my education (if possible), both of which are essential for building a stable and brighter future.

Due to this condition, I‚Äôve been unable to work consistently, which has placed a heavy financial burden on me. I am currently undergoing treatment, but the medical expenses are overwhelming.

You have definitely made this interesting..ngl a lil scary at times, but I try to trust you. I have been patient, yes I've been up and down about being with you..Baby if I was doing this to you rn, how would you feel?? What if the shoe was on the other foot?? 
Doing what you do must be madding thoo. You are making me worry about you. I don't like games, I never was the best player. I never cared for riddles too. If it gives me a headache..I generally stop dealing with it. I keep seeing the word selfish and  manipulator. When?? If we are a team and there is no I..Then when is there going to be a ""we""? Cause rn I got everyone else but you. You will never get to know the real me doing this..js...if you wanna know what's inside my head just ask me. You are the only person who will get the truth from me. Ask me any question you want the truth too and I got you. Like last night..I messaged back..on both places...and I can say it here. I was with my friend H and I sent you their # already... Now you have something else and you can keep it. No secrets, right? You made me a promise..a pinky promise..I know its not important to some, but its very important to me. Sooo what are we doing?? 

Baby, I personally need some coffee, a cheese danish and someone to rub on my booty. 5 months being a nun and not getting rolled up as a ball is getting to me ngl... You know I got options frfr. Let me tell you now and again... And anytime you wanna think or say that nobody does. I love you baby üíú 

Yesterday, now and tomorrow...will you please, please do what you said. I asked...now give me what I want. Or leave me be...you want me to act like a team memeber. Well this member wants to know she was heard. You got my number. üíú",4,1734013043.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,20,0.83,False

My partner (both early 30s) and I are not advanced international travelers- I‚Äôve never left the country, and he has only been to Australia. We‚Äôre trying to decide between two locations for a trip this upcoming May- Iceland or Ireland. We would be staying mainly in Reykjavik or Dublin and taking day tours to other places. The budget is roughly 2k USD each for 5-6 nights, flying from the DC area. We are not planning to rent a car in either location and are okay with the limitations of that. We‚Äôre happy to take public transportation. I‚Äôm aware that Ireland would probably be cheaper, especially with the cost of food in Iceland, but I get the feeling it‚Äôs my partner‚Äôs choice of destination! Here‚Äôs what we like to do:¬†



* Easy hikes (I prefer it to be more like a nature walk, he‚Äôs more adventurous)¬†
* Wildlife viewing
* Drinking/eating good food¬†
* General exploration without an itinerary (aka walking around and finding coffee shops)
* Museums and historic sites
* A mix of guided and self-led tours¬†



I would appreciate any and all advice here as I‚Äôve never left the States before, and I really have no idea what to expect. I am well-traveled within the country through, so I do know the basics! Thank you SO much.

Today, I come to you for some extra help... I need some cheer me up...

 I've been sad, under the weather, annoyed... and all the low moods possible. Christmas time hits me hard as I have not seen my family in over 10 years. The people I cared the most about have passed away, and its only my husband and me. Don't get me wrong, he is my whole world, but as such, I get super lonely. I do deal with mental health issues on the daily, but I've been hit harder lately... would you take the time to send me a card? It doesn't have to be about the holidays, I would actually love if you share your day to day with me, your pets, thoughts, anything really.

I am not picky on what you send, just please no monkeys, no lamellae/gills of any kind (mushrooms, duck beaks, fish), no clusters of circles, and no roaches. If it helps I love cats and dogs, coffee, crafts, YINMN Blue (kinda la cobalt), purple, teal, EDM, cooking, and food. Open to have an ongoing exchange

Thanks for reading, thanks for helping. Thanks for everything. 

Okay 


Love you

From last few months I have this strange feeling around my eyes after I ate something like choclate/sweets/maggi with cheese. Also after drinking coffee/ tea with sugar. Stopped reducing sugar and eating sweets.

Just googled now and it is saying it may be early stage of diabetes. For content I am 21M with  BMI index of 25.1. 
Now after a heavy meal at home (rice) I am feeling the same sensation around my eyes. 

I know reddit is not a place to seek medical advice any idea on what this phenomenon is. And should I  consult a doctor for this? ",3,1734012876.0,ask_Bondha,1,0.81,False
