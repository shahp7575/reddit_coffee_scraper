1oy89cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1oy89cv/everyones_blaming_me_for_my_moms_death_and_i_feel/,Everyone’s blaming me for my mom’s death and I feel like they have every reasons to do so. AIO?,"My mom took her own life after I left home and decided to move with my aunt. She had been physically and verbally abusive ever since my dad passed. She would often flip on me and sometimes for no reason at all. Her boyfriend is no better, though he never physically assaulted me he would often call me a leech and just a mouth to feed.

My last straw was when my mom threw hot coffee at me. It literally burned me and I needed space so I stayed at a motel that my friend’s dad paid for and some stranger’s. Eventually reached out to my aunt and she flew and picked me up.

I flew back home when my aunt broke the news that my mom took her own life. She couldn’t afford to join me so I have to go on my own. When I arrived, everyone’s eyes were on me. I feel like I am being blamed for everything. 

Been staying at a park for 2 days now since my flight back to my aunt’s place wont be for another 3 days. I don’t feel welcome at my late mom’s boyfriend’s apartment. I’m genuinely scared and I have to lie to my aunt where I’m staying because I know for a fact that I’ve been a burden to her financially with all the recent events that happened.

Any tips on how to stay safe on the streets for a few days? Where can I get free food? Where can I charge for free? I used up all the mcdonalds freebies that I could get and I need to know if there’s any other app that i could download for free food? I can’t afford to stay on a motel and dont want to inconvenience anyone since lately, I feel like a bother to everyone around me.

1oy87fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/1oy87fv/crazy_numbers_to_somewhat_normal/,Crazy Numbers to somewhat normal,"So back around the middle of August, I went into the doctor for what was just supposed to be a normal checkup. Refill on my allergy/asthma medication, note I've been just over a year smoke/nicotine free, and move on.

Part of the questioning from the doctor, I noted that since I worked 12.5 hour shifts, I get home around 7 (give or take a few minutes based on traffic) I need to stop drinking around 4 so I'm not waking up every hour to pee like I am through my entire shift. I thought that just because of the insane temps, I was extra thirsty because I was sweating a lot. Doctor wanted to run some bloodwork to be safe and check liver/kidney function. 

Turns out I had a b/s level of 538 and an A1C of 12. I asked for a follow-up test because how in the ever living hell was I not in a diabetic coma? A few weeks later had a finger prick test at the doctors and even after fasting for about 12 hours (give or take, I didn't keep track of the exact minutes) my sugars were still at 328. I guess I was just asymptomatic for most tell-tale signs given I felt perfectly normal except for increased thirst, and looking things up the human body *can* get used to an increased sugar level. Damage from the high levels still happens, just more subtly.

I wanted full bloodwork done before any medication, and tuns out I have type 2. I opted for metformin regiment instead of something like ozempic since that can be rather aggressive. Plus I've looked up potential side effects and the only one I get from metformin is the occasional headache.

Kicking sugary stuff has been hard since sugar is more addictive than cocaine. Plus since I really don't like the bitterness of coffee, soda is how I get my occasional caffeine kick. Trying many different zero sugar sodas, I've found that for my pallet Dr Pepper Zero (and the variations) are quite fine.

Also since I work the night shift and sleep/sweat all day, I switched from regular Gatorade to the zero sugar alternative, and it's okay but really the taste doesn't linger at all. For a variety I've found that some - but not all - Sparkling Ice drinks are fairly tasty. I don't care too much for the tart/bitter ones. Also something interesting I've noticed is that I'm not nearly as exhausted - like damn near falling asleep on the drive home having to pinch my inner thigh as hard as I can just to stay awake. Without a sugar crash, my energy levels seem to be much better.

Now. Last time my A1C was tested again was at the end of September and in just one month it went from that insane 12 to a still insane but promising 11.4! That was just switching from sugar drinks to zero sugar drinks and plenty of water too.

Ever since I've been keeping track of my sugars at home and even with the dawn-liver-glucose dump my waking numbers are from 77 on the low end to 120 on the high end. Some meals make me spike a little, but I've not seen a climb higher than 180 in two hours post meal (after a KFC chicken meal eating a biscuit with honey).

Yeah, my eating habits are more or less the same I just avoid having too much bread whether it's hamburger buns, or stuff coated in breading. Everything gets converted to sugar and bread/sugary sauces are pretty much unavoidable 100%, just have to be smart on what I get and kindly ask for things plain and not Karen out at people, after all this is my diabetes not the food workers. I have asked to hold on to menus for a few extra minutes to keep notes for my food log which isn't a big deal at all.

Because I work 3 long overnight shifts and have the rest of the week to myself I don't exactly have a set schedule and I'm usually active during the day on my days off. I honestly don't exercise all too much except at work (lapping a large warehouse 4x a night) but I'm down three notches on my belt. I just have an appointment at the end of December to get a full 3 month cycle before my next A1C check. Based on my numbers it should be good.",1,1763254750.0,type2diabetes,0,1.0,False

He has few friends and (until diagnosed) always got along better with younger kids or adults. No friends at school, but he worked for me a few times and he could hold his own with some pretty rough guys.
I was having coffee with his mother, and he came into the house with a girl we know who was ten. The way they interacted made me suspicious. They went to his room and I heard the shower running upstairs. Later they came down and she looked different, like she’d been in the bath. His mother says they hang out together a lot. The girl is a little over-mature for her age, and he’s very immature.
Later, I asked her mother if she’s okay with her daughter being alone with an older boy. She says she is, because “Jason” has the mind of a little kid and he’s emotionally immature. I mentioned that they might be showering together, and she said, “Well, you know, if they’re alone together, and they do that……” She was very wishy-washy about it. Like she didn’t want to know.
Here’s my problem. My kid is 13 and not allowed to be alone with boys unchaperoned.  There’s no way I’d let her be alone with a boy in that way. If there’s something going on that shouldn’t, he could be in trouble , but I don’t want him, with his awkward personality, going to jail. He’s easily impressed and could end up doing worse. 

Any ideas?

[DF54 / Breville bambino plus],"Hey all, I recently bought the red titanium espresso burrs from miicoffee to use with my DF 54 and ive been getting wildly different shot times between shots with the same workflow and I'm just wondering if this is normal or I might be messing up my process somewhere. I have a bambino plus that ive been using for about a year.

The weather in my area has been fluctuating quite a bit recently about 10-20 degrees colder day to day. On a warmer day I was getting 24-27 second pulls of espresso and now its been anywhere between 18-25 seconds a pull. I understand there's some variance to be expected but should it be that large?

Ive kept the grind setting on my DF54 consistent around 15 with devocion medium roasted coffee beans roasted within the last month.

I grind 18g in a IMS basket -> wdt -> then use a simple distribution tool -> then tamp.

Ive heard the distribution tool might do more harm than good so I pulled a second shot today without distributing with the tool and just wdt and it pulled even faster by about 2 seconds.

Im just wondering if what im experiencing is normal or what else I may be able to try to get a more consistent shot.

How tight should I be screwing in the burrs? I had some problems getting the screws out initially so Im hesitant to tighten them as much as I can again but Ive made sure that the screws were secure enough so they shouldn't move.",1,1763253939.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

It reminds me of how beautiful it is when two people make each other’s worlds feel lighter, warmer, a little more fun. I’m already happy with my life, truly. I feel grounded, grateful, and excited about the little things; a good cup of coffee, a new book, the smell of something fresh out of the oven, a dog happily trotting toward me. But life has a way of surprising us, and I’m open to the possibility that meeting someone special could make everything feel even sweeter.

So here’s me: I’m a pastry chef who genuinely loves her craft. Baking is my joy and my love language, I show affection through food, through warmth, through small gestures that say “I’m thinking of you.” I’m a brunette with curly hair, green eyes and fair skin, 167 cm tall. I love reading and getting lost in worlds that feel far bigger than the page. I enjoy meeting new people, not just small talk, but discovering who someone is beneath the surface. And trying new foods is one of my favorite ways to explore the world, whether it’s street food, fine dining, or something homemade and imperfect.

Personality-wise, I’m someone who laughs easily, who tries to see the good in things, who chooses hope and kindness as often as I can. I’m not looking to be “completed”, I’m looking to share joy with someone who is also happy with where they are, someone who isn’t searching from a place of loneliness but from a place of abundance. Someone who wants a partner to share smiles, curiosity, affection, and the quiet comfort of simply being understood.

What I hope to find is someone kind-hearted, emotionally steady, and open to something meaningful. Someone who values communication, who enjoys laughter, who has depth but also lightness. Someone who is curious about the world, who enjoys sharing experiences, and who isn’t afraid to let a connection unfold slowly, naturally, beautifully.

If music makes your emotions stir, if you enjoy wholesome moments sprinkled with playfulness, if you’re looking for something that feels both comforting and exciting… send me a message.

The games traffic has been picking up a bit and I have sorta been wanting to change the default environment of the game.

Option 1 (Current environment). A medieval themed village in which the user can play from multiple different play points from. The entire environment has a some indoor seating, a bridge with a water feature, and much more stylized medieval features.

Option 2. A viking themed hall with long tables. I was thinking of adding animations of some vikings playing chess in the background as you play. As the user you would just be playing at one of the tables in the hall.

Option 3. A nice modern coffee shop. This one doesn't have a theme to it. Its just a nice cozy environment

Where my conflict came from was I wasn't sure if I should stick to some cool theme like classical or medieval or if I should stick to a basic cozy environment. Your feed back would be much appreciate

We met today for coffee. It lasted a little over an hour. We talked about work, family, and traveling. We were both smiling, laughing, and asking questions. She mentions she enjoys alone time and likes to travel alone. In her dating profile she said no sex until marriage.

I was so nervous about finally meeting her all this week. After we left, we both said we liked talking to each other and I asked her if she wanted to get dinner sometime which she said yes. But after I got home I sent her a text saying it was really good meeting her. She replied by thanking me for the coffee and that she thinks I am great guy but only sees me as a friend. I asked her why and she said she thinks the chemistry is missing.

- As soon as the day starts and you've signed in. Your first task should always be to secure the tools you might need that are limited in quantity that are in high demand by everyone on the crew.

I'm not talking bout drills, impacts, or portabands. You can usually borrow that shit from people nearby. I'm talking bout 6' ladders in jobs with ceiling tiles, 8' ladders on jobs with ceiling grid but no tiles. Scissor lifts, ""D"" rings, 20ft yo yo.

Im talking bout the dumb shit no one ever thinks about til you realize you're going to need one only to spend an hour looking just to find out all the ones on the job are already being used by people.

You dont want to be in an office with 10' ceiling grids up and be forced to use a 12 footer for 6 hours because you wasted the first 2 hours of the day.

- If you know you're going to miss work like for school or a doctor's appointment. Even for a day. Secure your shit. 

Company provided drill/impact? Toss it in your toolbox/toolbag in the gang box at the end of the day. Tell your foreman its there but don't just leave it in the gangbox in the open.

2-tier cart? Rolling trash bin? Flat cart? Pallet jack? Chain that motherfucker to a column or the gang box.

One of the shittiest feelings is working on something in the middle of the week. Taking a day off. Coming back into work the next morning expecting to continue where you left off. Only to be welcomed, first thing in the morning, with your shit missing.

- If you gotta walk away from your ladder or scissor lift, to take a piss or a shit, hell even if its just for a split second. Put your fucking tools on the rung of the ladder at eye level. If its a lift hang your damn harness on the door and clipped to the lift.

People are a lot less likely to take company tools, if they have to touch someone's personal tools to take it.

- Always grab extra. 

Chances are if you have to go get more of something it's because you ran out. Take an inventory of what exactly you need to get the task done and grab extra. Don't hoard the shit but dont fucking be stupid bout it either.

If your count says you need 5 sets of nuts, bolts, and washers. Grab the 5 plus 3 extra just in case. If you ran out of duct/painters/electrical tape grab a new roll plus 1 extra and stash it in the gang box.

Remember you can always put extra material you don't use back later when its convenient, but it's inconvenient as fuck if you gotta go back for more because you didn't get enough the first time.

- If you get an opportunity to do something that requires skill. Always ask someone with experience to show you how they do it first. 

You'll learn a lot, gain a wealth of knowledge, and have an opportunity to ask questions in that one opportunity.

Things like making heads, dressing up panels, terminating and crimping wire, splicing and stuffing an outlet/junction box. Even just tying a knot.

Why learn everything the hard way when you can learn all the ways to do it right, from other people, and then make it better.

- Jobsite got a complicated floor plan or layout? Memorize where all the stairwells and elevator shafts are. 

Hallways, rooms, and offices can change from floor to floor. 

Stairwells and elevator shafts don't. Jobs will make a lot more sense quicker, especially in finished buildings, if you memorize where the stairs and elevators are.

- Want to make your JW happy. Help him do his job.

Doing things that take responsibilities off his plate or opportunities to eliminate things he has to worry bout make all the difference some days.

Don't get distracted on your phone because you finished what he asked you to do and you're waiting on him to tell you what to do next.

Inventory the materials yall are using and let him know when yall low. Clean the area so ya don't have to worry bout that shit. Keep an eye on the clock so he don't work through break or get whistle bit trying to clean up. 

Lay out tools and materials at the start of the day, organize that shit throughout the day, and store and secure that shit at the end of the day.

Don't use your status, as an apprentice, as an excuse to justify being a lazy piece of shit.

After you top out you'll learn really quickly, anything and everything that the apprentice doesn't do, the JW has to do.

And nobody wants to work with people that are deadweight.

Im not telling you to kiss his ass and get him coffee every morning. Just do us a favor, don't create more work for us. If you can help create less work, thats even better.

The inkwell, who we will call Ron, gets up at 6 am for his 8-5 job. “I don’t want to go to work today” he thinks to himself. “If I was a woman, I would have found a man to financially support me and I wouldn’t need to work. Women truly live life on easy mode.”


During his morning poop, he opens tinder. No matches besides a fat woman and a single mom. “I am a member of a marginalized community” he thinks to himself. “Women can just go on dating apps and be bombarded with matches from nice guys like me. They are so privileged.” he says. He shoots DM’s to his two matches, planning to use them for recreational use in the event that they do humble themselves and respond to a great guy like him. He sees no responses from the other low value women who he has matched with and wanted to pump and dump in the months prior, indicating that women are hypergamous and deserve to be alone. He daydreams of being a passport bro in the Philippines and having sex with gorgeous women all the time. 



Next, he goes to work. Ron does everything in his power to avoid talking to women at work. He is afraid he will be accused of sexual assault.  He only talks to them with the bare minimum in mind. Much to his distress, his old male boss was replaced by a woman. This nauseates him. He considers her a post wall career woman harpie hag. He has to do a one on one evaluation with her and he’s deeply afraid of being alone with her and being falsely accused. He does the evaluation and is extremely shy and demure. Terror fill his heart as he remembers Reddit stories and he dreads the idea that he will be falsely accused. Luckily, nothing happens. He gets “meets expectations” on his annual evaluation. His boss assigns him to a project with a team of women. A chill goes down his spine at the thought of all the potential false accusations. 


Ron stops at Starbucks for coffee. He notices that the guy in front of him is flirty with the female barista, and she looks uncomfortable. He writes a Reddit post about how this woman could easily escape Starbucks and find a good provider man if she only wasn’t so superficial about height. 


On his way home from his desk job, Ron thinks about how men have built the roads and all of society and the buildings. He thinks about how men have designed all of society and how women are so ungrateful to men for all their hard work and progress. 



When he eats dinner at home, Ron watches heightpill videos and laments that if he only wasn’t below average height, he would have a girlfriend by now. He opens tinder and sees how none of the unattractive women he was planning to pump and dump messaged him back. He goes to bed dreaming of the Philippines. He can’t stand western women.

1oy7ah3,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1oy7ah3/microcosms_how_meditation_helps_shift_our/,"Microcosms: how meditation helps shift our attention to the spiritual, and stay present in the physical world.","Day to day we are immersed in our physical world. The physical world is really just a game, which we call “life”. Physical world, the real world, life, and the physical game are all used interchangeably below.

When we meditate, by removing our focus from the physical game, we reconnect with the higher power that exists beyond the physical world.

Some people may refer to this higher power as God, some call it the source, and others call it the spirit or the soul. There are many words people use for this higher power. These words are only approximations, attempting to describe the same thing.

# Microcosms

The physical game we play in our everyday lives is a virtual microcosm within that higher connection that we are all part of. The physical game tends to steal our focus from the higher power.

Within our physical world, we also have virtual microcosm’s that can distract us from real life. Video games and scrolling on social media are microcosms that tend to remove your focus from the real world.

And the internet, our 9-5 computer jobs, movies and entertainment are also microcosms within the physical game that distract us from it.

Just like these virtual microcosms can remove our attention from the real world, our own physical reality steals our attention with so much completeness, that most of us forget about the higher power to which we are all connected.

These microcosm’s might look something like the representation in the image below.

# The key to presence

The key to being more present at any level of microcosm is to put your attention towards endeavors that support it.

* We become what we think about.
* You reap what you sow.
* A man’s life is what his thoughts make of it.
* A man is what he thinks about all day long.
* Human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind.

Sound familiar? Some great, dead philosophers said most of those bullet points above. They sure were consistent despite separation by time and place.

For example, woodworking and pottery are two endeavors whose outputs directly affect the physical game. Both woodworking and pottery involve creating something real, tangible, and *physical* which other people can interact and connect with in a physical way. You can pour coffee into a pottery mug, and place it on top of a wooden table, and drink the coffee with your physical body. You can sell or gift the outputs of both woodworking and pottery to other people, and they can use them in the physical microcosm to play cards or eat dinner or give as a wedding gift. By putting your attention into pottery and woodworking, you are enhancing your presence in the physical world.

Activities within the physical world can also support the microcosms above and below the physical world (the spiritual and the virtual).

For example, love supports the spiritual, but lust does not. And often, many distractions exist within the virtual that don’t support the physical.

# What happens when our attention is on the virtual?

Activities within the virtual world can support the physical world, but not always. You can waste a lot of attention in the virtual microcosm if you aren’t careful.

Internet websites, smartphone apps, and jobs in IT all support the virtual microcosm. The internet has become a true virtual world.

Doom scrolling and video gaming tend to be a distraction and a waste of attention. There are of course exceptions, for example, you could play video games with others in the real world, to stay connected and talk to your friends.

Many people (many white collar workers and IT / computer folks) spend much of their career in the virtual world. Of course, their jobs do support the physical reality because it lets them earn money to buy groceries and pay their rent. But I think your attention is still affected if you work one of these jobs (I do).

That’s why I always find value in meditation. I level-sets my outlook on life, helps me to feel truly thankful for everything around me, and reminds me that there is something greater than ourselves that we don’t quite understand.

Even if the microcosm representation isn’t totally accurate, meditating with these ideas in my head helps to avoid distraction, connect to the higher power, and avoid getting immersed in these dopamine inducing virtual outlets like social media and television.

I rode behind her because she had our 2 yo daughter in a kid seat on the back of the bike. I rode behind because I know how it is out here, and my gf doesn’t ride a lot. 

On our way back on Royal in the Marigny, had a suv behind me shouting at us to “Get off the road stupid!” As we literally continuously rode over the big green and white markings in the middle of the street indicating that bikes can use the lane. 

You’re yelling at me, whatever I know you’re an idiot, but yelling at a woman and a toddler? My favorite thing about these situations is, you’re ready to run someone over for what? To get to your destination 30 seconds sooner? The speed limit is 25, and it’s a street crowded with cars, pedestrians, etc on a Saturday afternoon, and yes bikes are allowed to use the road. This leads me to the next encounter. 

A few blocks further. We found ourselves in the quarter. 3-4 cars are in front of us going 10ish miles per hour.

Basically, I unlocked the final scenario with Roman and Emilia and destroyed entire town. There were a few close calls after I ditched stealth and just started shooting places up. But I had enough bandages to keep both characters alive and well.

Roman was the base guard and occasionally a scavenger after I reinforced the walls. Emilia handled early game scavenging. Katia, Boris, and Arica tried to join our shelter but were told to go away. There was no shelter for the normal people. 

Small Apartment Building and Church had bandits. Outpost and Airport had soldiers naturally. The rest were civilians. I think Roman got 18 kills, Emilia - 33.

Mental state-wise they were OK. Cigarettes, coffee, and eating every day overcomes killing over 50 people, at least for them.

Looking to meet people who appreciate honesty, depth, and a bit of nerd energy. Mostly hoping to connect with creatives who are comfortable with themselves and their work.

About me:
54M. A newly single writer and engineer.
Neurodivergent in a pattern-seeking, calm, steady, no-drama way. Middle-class, career-stable, emotionally grounded.

Into wine, cheese, books, sci-fi, European road trips, and old cars.
Dry sense of humor and the social grace of an overthinking golden retriever, but I’m real, loyal, and easy to talk to once I warm up.

Who I vibe with:

I tend to connect well with women who are comfortable with age gaps. Not for cliché dynamics, but because they’re drawn to steadiness, depth, intellect, and someone who actually listens. If that’s you, we’ll probably click fast.

I like people who are:
self-aware, emotionally intelligent
nerdy, creative, or offbeat
queer-friendly and open-minded
energetic about their hyperfocused passions, whether that’s manga, wine, books, or anything else

What I’m looking for:
Friends first, maybe more if the chemistry hits. I’m not in a rush and not trying to be 30. Just showing up as myself and hoping to meet someone who values that.

If you’re in Cville or close by and want to grab a coffee, wander the Downtown Mall, check out Tilman’s wine flights, or talk about books and niche interests, message me.

The three staff seemed more focussed on getting to know each other than getting product to customers. It was 11min20sec from the time I tapped my card to the time I got my order. Another customer asked me ""How long does it take for them to make a bloody coffee?"" I replied ""We'll know by lunchtime I guess"". 

The coffee (small flat white, extra shot) was delightful. The espresso was prepared with care and the milk texturing was sublime. The chocolate croissant was stale and chewy and, at a guess, at LEAST a day or two old.

Come for the coffee. Prepare to wait. Leave the food on their side of the counter.

Verdict: 🌟🌟🌟 (3 stars*)

────🗁🗎 Document loading... ──── 

Huffing through a shortage of air, your feet hurriedly encounter the frosty forest floor as you stumble down a hill crowded with tall trees that seem to cast eerie shadows underneath their branches.  

Panic surging into your veins, you manage to discern past the sound of blood circulating through your ears; the faint scuffling of snow from that... that ***THING!*** 

────🗁🗎 Document loading... ──── 

“Good evening, residents of Stone Mire. I, your host, Mrs. Roccy, am reporting today's exciting news. I’m sure information has spread about our city allegedly welcoming monsters and even allowing them in... These rumours are indeed true, so please proceed with caution before entering our lovely abode. On a slightly lighter note, I would like to tell the tale of how you found yourself in this situation. Yes, yes, how cliché! Don’t like it, then don’t watch my news! But before we delve deeper into the story, it’s important to go from the top... Shall we, my dear citizen?” 

────🗁🗎 Document loading... ──── 

Your city was, and still is, more than a pigsty: between its run-down buildings doing little to bring the town any positive reviews from outsiders, the streets always reeking of sewage, police forces that mostly sit on their lazy asses day in and day out, which provokes the crime rate to spike, and many other piling factors. Unfortunately, despite all its imperfections, it was still your home, and at the end of the day, you wouldn’t trade it for anything. 

***Mostly.***  

You were a detective. Somewhat along those lines, anyway. A crime scene investigator, otherwise known as a CSI, is what you really are. You usually got called in to investigate crime scenes and gather information, by yourself more times than not, since you were the only one in your firm who handled sensitive evidence. Working in the Studd Police Department was a big responsibility, considering more crime analysists weren’t doing their jobs, it meant more work was piled on you and everyone else. 

Which, whether you liked it or not, was becoming more often. 

You see, this morning, you were walking towards the front entrance of your workplace; your thick, brown trench coat billowing behind you furiously in the wind while you hurriedly forced yourself through the doors. A frown formed on your face as you took in the miserable surroundings of the entry. Throw-up was right beside the front desk that nobody was occupying, though you dismissed it while walking by; too accustomed to sights like that to make you cringe. 

Though your sour attitude is understandable. Before this, you were forced to get yourself into a high-speed chase along a dark highway with two drugged idiots who robbed a bank, which lasted till daybreak.  

Originally, you were only there to investigate a forgotten case where somebody had stolen money from the building. However, when the masked duo recklessly broke into the premises and began to steal more money before fleeing, you were obliged to pursue them being the only one actively available. 

That was how you ended up dragging your feet up a flight of stairs, sleep-deprived and in desperate need of a coffee. 

Sadly, once you forced yourself into your department, ready to give a debrief on your more than infuriating mission to your supervisor, or otherwise known as the ‘Captain’, it was soon brought to your attention that everybody was standing in the briefing room, crowding what you assumed would be a PowerPoint of a new case. You gave a long sigh before you made your way into the room. 

As you walked in, you saw a friend nodding towards you. They were a forensic specialist in toxicology; hence the name, they would deal with things such as toxins, including things such as drugs, alcohol, poisons, and more. 

The two of you gave a whispered greeting. ",1,1763251180.0,u_Quiet_Intern1008,0,1.0,False

2. No discomfort most days the whole day

1. Low salt - avoiding salt wherever I can. That also means things with a lot of salt in it.

Feeling confused after last night.,"I am 27 and he is also 27. We have been talking and seeing each other for about one month. Things started very sweet and romantic, but last night confused me a lot. I want to share the full picture so it makes sense.

Date 1: Great chemistry and a Target run

We got tacos and drinks. He paid for everything, opened doors, and walked me to my car. He did comment on how the drink prices were cheaper than what he is used to, but I brushed it off.

Later my car got stuck in a garage, so he drove me home. We stopped at Target because I needed a hoodie. When I went to pay, he stepped away to grab scissors so I could cut the tags off. I paid for my own item, which is totally normal, but the timing felt a little convenient.

Date 2: Strong emotional and physical connection

We watched the sunset at the beach and things got very intimate. We ended up having unprotected sex, which was a mutual mistake. Afterward he said he was starving, but he did not invite me to eat with him, which made me feel a little dismissed. I got Plan B afterward.

Between dates I brought up how that made me feel. We had an emotional check in. He listened, validated me, and we talked everything through. We were intimate again with protection and he planned our next date with care.

Date 3: Very romantic

He took me out to a nice dinner. He paid, opened doors, kissed my forehead and hands, and treated me very gently. I felt really cared for. I stayed over afterward, but he did not invite me to breakfast or coffee the next morning, which confused me a little because the rest of the date had been romantic.

Date 4: Everything felt different

Last night he drove in the rain to see me, which I appreciated, but his energy was completely different.

• No kiss hello
• No car door opening
• He looked exhausted
• He had not eaten in 12 hours
• He was stressed from work
• He mentioned needing to leave early
• He seemed bothered by long wait times
• He wanted a cheaper restaurant when the first one had a long wait
• He talked about focusing on his future plans and goals

Once he finally ate, he relaxed and became warmer. We held hands and he kissed me. The vibe got better.

But when the bill came he asked if I could get it. I paid because I did not want tension, but I felt sad afterward.

When he dropped me off, my umbrella broke and I had to walk home in the rain. I cried in the shower, not about the money, but because of how different he felt compared to the previous dates.

What the girl he previously dated told me

I spoke to someone he dated before. She said:

• He paid for all of their dates
• He was financially cautious
• He was not romantic with her
• He never asked her to pay
• He reflects a lot
• He can be dominant
• He is loyal
• His spiritual journey was a yellow flag for her
• She was surprised he asked me to pay
• She thinks he only spends freely when he feels very safe and comfortable with someone

When I told her about the unprotected sex and the no condoms comment, she said that was concerning.

She was surprised by some of the things that happened with me because she had not experienced those patterns with him.

Why I feel confused

When he is rested and in a good headspace, he is affectionate, warm, romantic, consistent, and thoughtful. I feel very cared for.

When he is stressed or hungry, he becomes different. Quieter, less affectionate, more guarded with money, more impatient, and less emotionally present.

I do not know which version is the real him. Last night was so different from everything else that it left me unsure if this is just normal early dating turbulence or yellow flags I should pay attention to.

Thank you for reading and for any advice.

We’re hosting a Fall Movie & Game Night + Friendsgiving on Friday, November 21st at Marine Park Coffee (3411 Avenue S). Doors open at 5:00 PM — come early to hang out, play board games, and meet people before the movie starts around 6:30 PM.

We’ll be showing My Cousin Vinny, the classic Joe Pesci/Marisa Tomei comedy that’s basically required Brooklyn viewing. Marine Park Coffee will be set up like a cozy mini theater with popcorn, water, and a relaxed community vibe.

Since it’s Friendsgiving, feel free to bring a dish, dessert, or snack to share. We’ll eat together before and during the movie — a great way to try some new food and meet new folks.

The event is open to young adults ages 18–35 with a $5 cover that includes popcorn and water. Soft drinks will be available for $1 thanks to Marine Park Coffee.

Whether you’re from Marine Park, Mill Basin, Bay Ridge, Midwood, or anywhere nearby, you’re totally welcome — the goal is simply to create a fun space for young adults to meet, connect, and enjoy the night.

But there’s something I’ve been struggling with that I’m not sure how to bring up.

I’m honestly afraid of running into my therapist in public.

Not because I want to see her or cross any boundaries. It’s the opposite, actually. I’m scared the interaction would feel awkward, or she’d end the conversation before I do, or I’d overthink every tiny thing. I even catch myself scanning for her on the street, not because I want to run into her, but because I’m anxious that it might happen. 

It feels like an attachment/anxiety thing, but she doesn’t specialize in attachment issues. I don’t want her to misinterpret my fear as wanting to have some kind of relationship outside therapy. It’s purely boundary anxiety.

I also get scared I’d feel lonelier if I saw her with her friends and got reminded that she has a whole life separate from our therapeutic relationship.

Part of what makes this harder is that I don’t really have a consistent friend group. I know a lot of people and I’m socially capable, but I don’t see anyone regularly. So therapy ends up being the most consistent relationship in my week, which I think is why the idea of seeing her “out of context” makes me so nervous.

As I’ve mentioned, my therapist doesn’t specialize in attachment specifically, so I’m not sure whether bringing this up would be helpful or just make things weird. Has anyone else ever felt this way? Did you talk to your therapist about it, and how did it go?

I would be interested to hear others’ experiences or any therapists’ perspectives.

EDIT: When I say “running into my therapist in public,” I mean in a closed space like a coffee shop.   Also, I’ve been in therapy before, but this is the first time I’m feeling this. ",10,1763250392.0,TalkTherapy,10,1.0,False

1oy6k41,https://www.reddit.com/r/CodeAndCapital/comments/1oy6k41/us_coffee_tariffs_still_too_high_warns_top/,"US coffee tariffs still “too high,” warns top supplier Brazil – what it means for prices and trade","Brazil, the world’s largest coffee exporter and a key supplier to the US, is warning that current US tariffs on Brazilian coffee remain excessive, even after Washington signaled modest relief on some food duties. Officials argue that the levies are still distorting trade and undermining the economics of shipping beans to the US market.​

The backdrop is a sweeping US tariff hike on Brazilian goods earlier in 2025: an existing 10% duty was topped up with an extra 40% ad‑valorem tariff, taking the effective rate on most Brazilian imports—including coffee—to around 50%. That hit iconic exports like coffee, beef, fruit and sugar, and was widely read as a politically charged move tied to disputes over Brazilian domestic politics and treatment of US firms.​

For coffee specifically, the shock has been severe. Brazil supplies about 30% of the US coffee market, and reports from October show US roasters grappling with 50% tariffs, cancelling contracts, eating higher costs, or scrambling for alternative origins. US coffee prices have climbed sharply, with some consumers facing up to 40% higher retail prices amid the combined impact of tariffs and weather‑driven supply concerns in Brazil.​

In recent days, the US administration has talked about trimming some food tariffs to blunt grocery inflation, including on items like coffee and bananas, but Brazilian officials say key agricultural products will still face around 40% in additional duties even after tweaks. Vice President Geraldo Alckmin noted that goods such as coffee, beef and tropical fruit remain heavily taxed, limiting the practical benefit of any partial rollback.​

As a result, Brazil has been redirecting coffee exports toward Europe and Asia, while US buyers “tear through stocks” and explore other suppliers like Colombia and Vietnam—who themselves face lower, but still notable, US tariffs in the 10–20% range. Analysts warn this rerouting could reshape long‑standing coffee trade flows, keep US prices elevated, and inject more volatility into global futures as roasters and traders operate “hand‑to‑mouth” while waiting for a clearer US–Brazil trade deal.",1,1763250268.0,CodeAndCapital,0,1.0,False

I had a kind of unpleasant conversation with my mom on the walk there which definitely didn’t help my mood/energy but I also felt like we just weren’t vibing, we went from subject to subject and nothing really flowed and I felt like she looked like she didn’t want to be there. I sometimes can have a nervous energy and I feel like I was jumping around and stuttering a bit. Lunch lasted like an hour and half and after we left I felt so bad. 

I just really want to make close friends and I keep blaming myself for how that went, even though we might just not be super compatible personalities but I can’t help feel like I did something wrong and failed at socializing basically.

A few of us have started a ""classics"" book club recently. Our first was a three time meetup for Middlemarch by George Eliot.

Our second will be more of an ""author study"" approach, for James Joyce.

First we will read all of Dubliners and also watch the film version of one of the short stories in there (""The Dead"").

Then, a few weeks later, date TBA, we will read A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (and perhaps a film adaptation). 

Reply to this or DM if interested!

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

In regards to aro/ace things, I'm a lifelong demisexual who's becoming less demisexual and more demiromantic with age. I'm also sapiosexual/romantic, graysexual online, and somewhat/increasingly aegosexual,

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, from simple and bitter to excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, primarily because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

So usually, when I (22F) ask out a guy, I suggest coffee or ice cream bc it’s chill and a daytime activity.

Personally, I don’t like drinking around strangers, and dinner seems like a big commitment for someone you haven’t met before - (1) it can be pretty long, (2) some restaurants are pricey (3) eating imo distracts from conversation (4) I’m a picky eater, (5) I’m generally too nervous to eat anyway, and (6) a lot of guys take it as a segue to invite you to their place

Recently a guy (25M) invited me out to dinner and drinks. We’ve been talking for a couple weeks and I really like him. But I don’t want to do dinner or drinks bc of the reasons above. Would it be weird for me to just suggest we do coffee instead, or should I just put on my big girl panties and go to dinner? Lol

We were doing shit like working from home together (her idea), txting gm and gn, up till 4am talking together, etc. She seemed genuinely awed by me so much that I was anxious about our future as I was half planning to move cities in the next year (hadn’t shared this with her yet).

But then I thought let me stop being a detached loser, overlook some minor flaws and actually try something with this person who I have a great connection with. So after like 5 weeks of very bf/gf behavior, I sent her a text (mistake, should have sprung it in person) to the affect of “are you open to dating eventually? If so I’m excited abt that possibility. No worries if not” and I genuinely meant no worries if not. I was loving the casual uncommitted setup but I wanted to see if more was possible. I wasn’t even asking to be exclusive or anything.

She said no lol and in the fallout I think I spooked her/pissed her off. I told her I was reconsidering moving if we were on a serious path. And that I felt “understood” by her (ughhh). Basically I came off like a total simp when I really didn’t mean to. A day later she said she wanted to stop seeing each other saying she “couldn’t trust that it wouldn’t get messy”. Maybe like two more texts were exchanged and then she stopped responding.

A week or so later I sent that classic desperate text asking to get some “coffee” and “talk”. She read it 24 hours later, didn’t respond, and then grid posted a few selfies on ig. She still watched my stories and stuff but it feels like she moved on and replaced me almost immediately. Embarrassed how much it hurts. I thought we had something that she would miss at least a little bit.

Idk I’m bummed and looking for answers/support or just to be roasted for fucking it up so bad. If I had just sprung this convo on her in person it would have been so quick and we’d still be seeing each other. It sucks.

Edit:
I want to add that she was clear in the beginning about just wanting casual/fwb with me and set rules like minimal txting and no sleepovers. But then she was texting all the time and wanted me to stay the night everytime I went to her place. So I started leaning in. I think the reality is she has in idea in her head of her long term partner and I don’t fit it in some way. But she was gonna happily take all the attention I gave her as long as I didn’t ask for commitment. And I would have been fine with that but I never got a chance to prove it.

She was always trying to wedge her way into people’s relationships and acted like she was a “throuple” with some of the couples who knew her. She drove away a lot of our mutual friends. I tried to be kind to her and gave her the benefit of the doubt multiple times, but every single time she would stab me in the back or drive me insane with her behavior. I cut her off after college 4 years ago and forgot about her. 

She reached out to me a couple days ago and sent this message. I guess she’s trying to reconcile with people she’s hurt in the past for a program she’s in. I have no desire to reconnect with her. But the fact that she said that she spoke to my boyfriend at the time (now ex) behind my back has been a bit of a shock to my system. 

For context, I met that boyfriend in college and we were madly in love. We were together for almost 3 years and he bought a ring and planned to propose to me. He told my parents and whole family, and everyone thought he was the one for me. A month before he was supposed to propose, he slept with another girl and broke things off with me shortly after. It was the worst heartbreak of my life. It absolutely shattered me—I loved him so, so deeply. I still deal with the trauma of betrayal and some trust issues to this day.

It’s been years, so why does her admitting that she spoke to my ex (while we were together) behind my back feel so hurtful? I’ve healed and moved on and am in a healthy relationship with a wonderful man. It’s been years. Why does this bother me? And how do I respond to her? Should I respond at all?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **South Carolina Gamecocks vs. USC Trojans: A Rivalry Rekindled with Fire and Freshman Flair**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans, a basketball version of “The Hunger Games,” but with fewer spears and more three-pointers. On November 15, 2025, the South Carolina Gamecocks (3-0) will strut into Crypto.com Arena to face the USC Trojans (2-0) in a top-10 showdown that’s been simmering since 2014—yes, *that* long. Think of it as two exes finally running into each other at a mutual friend’s wedding, but instead of awkward small talk, they’re trading haymakers on the hardwood.

### Parsing the Odds: A Game of Chicken (No, Literally)

Let’s start with the numbers. South Carolina is the clear favorite here, with odds ranging from **-11.5 to -12.5 on the spread** and decimal moneyline odds as low as **1.12** (implying a **\~52.6% implied win probability**). For USC, their moneyline odds hover between **+5.5 and +6.5** (a **\~13.8% implied chance**), which is about the same chance I have of correctly spelling “Gamecocks” without looking it up. The total is locked at **137.5 points**, suggesting this won’t be a snoozefest—though if you’re betting the under, you might want to pack a napkin.

The spread tells a simple story: South Carolina is favored by over a dozen points, which in basketball terms is like showing up to a barbecue with a 12-pack of beer and a side of confidence. But here’s the twist: USC isn’t exactly a pushover. They’ve won their opener behind freshman **Jazzy Davison**, who dropped 21 points on NC State like she’s been playing since she was a toddler (though, honestly, most basketball prodigies start younger than that).

### Digesting the News: Freshman Frenzy vs. The “Four for the Future”

South Carolina, ranked in the top two nationally, is a well-oiled machine with **four players averaging double-digit points**. Their defense? A fortress. Last season, they allowed just 58.0 points per game, which is about the same amount of patience I have for people who take forever to order at coffee shops. Their recent 65-37 drubbing of Clemson? A masterclass in efficiency—or as the Clemson fans are probably calling it, “a fire drill.”

I find her content relatable, fun, SMART. She lives in Maine. She's 10 years younger than me but I really just find her content worth watching. She's so real.

To my shock/horror, she posted a story yesterday and it's a screenshot of her texting someone ... and I realize... oh my god she's texting Michel. And Michel is IN MAINE. Oh noooo, Emma, please don't meet up with her.

And sure enough, Emma is right around the corner from where Michel is at some coffee shop I think, and she shows the video of her walking in (not the actual meeting). As she walks in, Emma comments to the camera on how rough she looks and it's the worst timing to meet this new friend. And I just thought to myself.... you look beautiful and this is already bad that you're questioning yourself before you even meet.

I honestly want the best for Emma, and I think that old Michel probably would have been a great friend to her. But this Michel, the new Michel I'm like... protective! I don't like this for Emma.  I wonder if anyone else here follows them both. I don't follow Michel, but I was curious so I went to her stories and she did repost Emma's story. Someone (can't remember who) mentioned a shared love of lighthouses.

1oy5vka,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1oy5vka/heres_my_gallbladder_experience_a_trick_to/,Here’s my gallbladder experience + a trick to relieve attacks,"I’m 30 years old. I’m a chef, so I guess my diet probably was the reason for my gallbladder problems. 5 years ago I had my first attacks. At first I thought it was a gastrique infection or food poisoning. The first attack I had was intense. It started off slowly in the back, and developed into a really intense pain, which affected my breathing. I couldn’t find a good position to be in. I rushed to the emergency and after having kept me the night, they thought it was food poisoning. Anyways, my attacks kept coming and I went back again, and finally this time got an ultrasound and got told that my gallbladder was full of tiny stones. I went to see a surgeon and his response was: surgery. At that time it was Covid so there was a 9 month wait and I was determined to try to figure it out on my own. So from that day, I changed my diet, cut out a lot of fat, started drinking apple cider vinegar and exercising a lot. I didn’t try the olive oil flushes as I heard lots of bad things about them. And 9 months later I hadn’t had an attack so I cancelled the surgery. I kept exercising and eating slightly healthier than before, but two months ago my attacks came back. The first attack I had was a lovely reminder of how intense they can be… I called an ambulance because I had trouble breathing. A quick ultrasound later, they confirmed once again that it was my gallbladder acting up. I knew it was time to get it removed. I had the surgery 2 days ago, and I’m already feeling really good and recovering smoothly. I’ve read lots of stories about gallbladder removal gone badly and it often seems that it happens to people that waited to long to get it removed thus had it removed in a hurry. Mine wasn’t inflamed as it got removed, so it was a simple surgery. The doctor told me if it’s an emergency operation, it’s much more dangerous and difficult to do. 

My advice to people: 
- if you have stones that give you nasty attacks, eventually you might have to get it removed. It might make a difference if you do it when your gallbladder is still in good condition, compared to leaving it too long and having to do an emergency operation.
- it also depends if you have 2 stones or a gall bladder full of them. Some countries recommend surgery even for 1, while others don’t. I might not have opted for surgery if I only had a few, but mine was full so it was obvious. 
- natural remedies can work for some, but be careful with things like flushes etc. It’s not normal to drink so much olive oil in one go, so why do it.
- gallbladder attack relief trick: press on the opposite side of where your gallbladder is, so on the left, under your rib cage, where the pancreas is. It should be pretty painful while you’re having an attack. This helped many of my attacks calm down. 
- fat isnt the only trigger. I believe white sugar was a big factor for me. I never ate much deep fried food or burgers etc. But always enjoyed cookies and cakes with quite a lot of sugar in them. Both fat and sugar play a big role in attacks. If you’re trying to avoid attacks, try to stay away from these. Also eggs and dairy products. 
- there are a lot of horror stories about gall bladder removal on Reddit and online. Keep in mind that, most people who have a good experience, don’t go online to post about it, it’s mostly people with bad experiences trying to find a cure. Look more into hospital statistics and youll find the truth of how well it works out for most people 
- it might seem like a nice thing to try to remove them naturally. But keep in mind that if the attacks come back during the wrong time, they can really cause some damage. While you’re abroad, or while diving. Etc. Could be life threatening. And also each stone that causes an attack could get stuck and cause pancreatis, which is a whole other problem to deal with. Surgery really is smooth experience and I recommend it. 
- even if you do surgery, don’t expect it to just completely take away the problem. If you’ve had bad eating habits, it’s really important to fix them, otherwise you can end up with a new problem. Fix the reason why you got them in the first place. Ive read about people who had surgery and were eating in McDonald’s the next day. Or people who complained about not being able to eat really greasy food. Let’s be real, our bodies aren’t supposed to digest really greasy food. 
- after surgery: try to eat light the first few days. Don’t eat/drink coffee, alcohol, spicy food, reduce sugar and fat. Try to stick away from dairy products and laxative foods like prunes. Youll have a decent amount of gas, (your belly gets filled with gas during the operation) walk daily. Moving is the biggest remover of gas. Drink lots of water. Get lots of sleep. I’ve heard of people having diareah, my first poops were solid, so that was a nice surprise. I’ll keep you updated on how the healing goes. ",8,1763248411.0,gallbladders,1,1.0,False

I have an idea on **interactive virtual-asset entertainment project**. The core mechanism has received positive feedback from people in the industry, and I’m now looking for a reliable developer to help build the first demo for internal testing.

To protect the project’s competitive edge, I won’t disclose the exact mechanism publicly.  
What I *can* say is:

* It’s **not** a traditional token project
* It’s **not** a simple NFT marketplace, DEX, or copy-paste smart contract product
* The experience involves **game/interaction design + Web3 payment & on-chain transparency**
* Technical difficulty is moderate, but stability and fairness are important (randomness, verifiability, etc.)

And I am looking for the developer with:

* Experience with **Solidity / EVM chains / Web3.js / ethers.js**
* Ability to build **simple smart contracts** and review basic security logic
* Front-end skills with **React / Next.js**
* Backend skills (**Node.js / Python / Go**)
* Interest in on-chain games, verifiable randomness (VRF), fairness mechanisms, or Web3 product design

if you're interested I am glad to grab a coffee or we can just have a video call, I would like to explain it to you.",1,1763248402.0,tumunich,0,1.0,False

I love and drink all kinds of coffee drinks. Espresso, lungo and just a tall cup of joe for non milky drinks are my favorite. Flat white is my preferred milky coffee, but I don't expect to make those myself.

Anyway, I think I've landed on a Delonghi and I can grab an ""outlet"" (ie the ones that have been on display in the store) for quite decent prices I believe.

The Start ECAM220.60.B for the equivalent of about $370, or the Evo ECAM290.61.SB for about $80 more. Both are listed as ""as new with original packaging"".

From comparisons and reviews I can't really tell if the differences between them actually warrant a price difference at all.

My family is full of night owls so I’ve embraced that. I can easily be up until 3 am most nights. My issue isn’t really falling asleep but waking up frequently. Every 2-3 hours. This has always been a thing despite different diets and habits or medications, although I’m not the most consistent person nor do try too hard. If I do go to sleep sort of early (11pm-12am) I will sometimes wake up around 4 am fully energized. I sort of just make myself go back to sleep because… 8hours whatever.. but I’ll wake up later at 10- noon sleepier than at 4am. 10 am is about the earliest I can be awake most days, if I try. And I feel most rested in between snoozing the alarm. I drink coffee and tea during the day sometimes. I really don’t have any issue falling asleep so I don’t go for melatonin or anything but should I if I just want to stay asleep? All the advice I’ve gotten from doctors has generally been about how to fall asleep but I can do that well and anywhere lol.
Has anyone tried segmented sleeping?

Please let me thank you somehow.  Treat you to a coffee or ice cream, or a museum visit or something.  Or I can bake you something as a thank you.  It’s the least I can do.  And don’t worry, I won’t try to creep on you.  I’m very queer and prefer other guys.

Shoot me a message with something that lets me know it was you.  Bus route, description of me, something that we said to each other.
