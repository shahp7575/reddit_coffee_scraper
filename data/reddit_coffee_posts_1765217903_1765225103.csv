I’ll also say the flight attendants aren’t doing a bad job, but seem to be barely making the effort… it feels lazy and disconnected.  FWIW, I’ve had predominantly good to excellent experiences in my 8 months flying AA as my primary airline ",1,1765224978.0,americanairlines,1,1.0,False

Over the course of my life, I've managed to avoid flying with an iron vigor: despite the many situations it reared its ugly head into. I would drive three days straight, with only power naps to get me by, if it meant I didn't have to fly there. A feat I’ve taken many times. This recent predicament left me very few options; which driving was not one. 

While eating at a Golden Corral, my dad got a wishbone lodged in his windpipe. By the time they got it dislodged he was already a shade of violet and lacking oxygen in his brain. While stable now, he might not be for very long: leaving this state of urgency. And the prospect that, if I don't see him now, I may never again. Thus, my FOMO negated my fear of flying, and forced my hand into buying a ticket.

I trembled all the way through TSA, and the long walk to my gate: practically fossilized in my seat by the time my section was called to board. I whipped out my phone, my boarding pass illuminated on its greasy screen. I wasn't even sure how long I stood there trying to scan my pass; my shaky hands making the code impossible to read. The ramp operator took special notice of me when the barcode was read. She must've noticed my petrification. 

""We really appreciate you"". She said with an uncurated genuinity in her tone. 

""Uh..thanks. I appreciate you too"" 

I thought about the exchange down the entire ramp, was I weird or was she. Nobody could've expected her to say that. Nobody would've had a response prepared. Like a miscalculated: “You too.”, in response to a, “Enjoy the show.”, at a ticket booth. Hopefully my face would be lost in the mass of people she sees everyday. 

When I came face to face with the plane's door; I ground the line of passengers to a halt. My eyes were fixed to the gap between the ramp and plane. The sound of engines and wind so loud, through just half a foot of space. Already we were so high up. I could fall through the gap if I was 90lbs lighter: break my ankle on impact. I snapped back to reality, and knew it was socially unexceptable to stand here any longer. The groans of the other passengers grew ever clear, along with the act of a kid tugging on his mom's dress, asking why we were waiting. If that kid isn't afraid, I shouldn't be either. I had no choice but to pass through the Gate to Hell, and join the Army of the Damned. 

As I stepped over the gap it's as if my soul did slip out of me; straight through it: just a skid mark on the tarmac. My confidence was already ailing. 

Then the wheel on my suitcase got caught on the outside of the door. I started tugging and twisting; looking back to assess the problem only to be met with a dozen or so faces, watching hatefully. With a hardy yank my carry-on was freed, one less wheel, and a date with the dump when this trip was over. I couldn't even look the flight attendants in the eyes when I rounded the corner, and started down the aisle to my seat. 

When I made it to my row the three seats were empty. Which brought a slight sense of relief, as my seat, was in my middle. I thought maybe, I would get the chance to take an Advil PM, and sprawl out across the seats. I was clenched into my seat for only a few minutes, when my rowmate to my left arrived. 

He was a portly man: adorned with a Cannibal Corpse shirt, full tattoo sleeve, and skull sandals. Despite what I may have expected him to be like, he ended up being rather friendly: simply greeting me, and plopping into his seat. His smell became a bit hard to bear. It was like: a very masculine, mahogany forest cologne, with a dusting of baby powder. Under normal circumstances, I likely wouldn't have noticed; but my stomach already in knots, and my senses heightened; the scent was very nauseating.

The arrival of my rowmate to the right, nearly made me flip my lid. It was a child. Roughly six or seven, his mom pushed him to our row, and turned his head from his tablet to his seat. The man and I had to get up to make way for the kid; carefully stepping in the spaces between our bags. The kid paid no mind to our bags however, stepping on mine bag to get to his seat. His mom had only enough energy to scold him in a defeated exclamation. With the gifting of a, tablet she parted ways; squeezing her way back up the aisle; so many rows away; too far to call for help. 

The depth of the situation was becoming dire; like I’m 20 leagues under the sea and the pressure is about to blow in the hall. The kid started watching a video of a man, with a painfully obnoxious voice, playing some children's game. It became quickly evident that the kid, did not have headphones; and I would have to listen to his videos until the tablet died. Who knows what torture would come after the tablet died. 

The Captain eventually introduced himself, and gave his words of reassurance that, despite the six hour flight ahead of us, there will be no problems along the way. Then came the safety demonstration from the flight attendants; the display was sickening. They tried to be humorous, to relieve tension, or amuse us: I’m not sure but it didn’t work. Just a stark reminder that a life jacket and breathing mask, doesn’t fare well against high altitude combustion. Nor would it be helpful if I was flung from the plane. It's rock from start to finish; when I meet the ground at mach 10 speeds, the life jacket would be an orange lump in a red puddle. 

Takeoff was horrible. My fingers bored wedges into the ends of the arm rests; latched to them like I was riding a roller coaster. The pressure in my ears sunk into a faint ring, until they popped thirty minutes into the flight. By that time, the man in the aisle seat was already knocked out. As it turns out, he had horrible sleep apnea. His head would be flopped back, mouth wide open, really letting his snore travel through the cabin. Sometimes he would choke, his tongue falling back into his throat, forcing him to burst awake when his body realized he was dying. The first time this happened, his arm flung out and hit me: I let out a yelp that disturbed everyone around us further. He apologized, but before he seemed to finish his sentence, he was back asleep: head slumped over his shoulder, facing me. I tried to push it away with my pointer finger, but it always rolled its way back; eventually slumping onto my shoulder, that's when I really pushed him away. The second time he choked himself awake, a flight attendant had just rolled the cart through, having to lift his head out of the aisle to get past him. The sample of pepsi she had given me, made its way onto me when the man knocked it out of my hands. 

""I'm so sorry man, I didn't mean to"". The man said as I used my sleeve to pat dribblets of pepsi off my face. He was slumped over snoring again immediately after. 

The kid was still glued to his tablet; his neck craned over, as it sat in his lap. The poor kid was doomed to have a turtles neck when he reached his golden years: shoulders all slouched, connected to the collar with a protruding spiny bump. The dreaded moment arrived too soon, his tablet died; he wasted no time to ask for his mom. Tugging on my sleeve, seeing if I knew where she was. I told him she was in front of us, but it must not have registered, as he continued to ask. I didn't know what to do, I thought I could just pick him up and set him in the aisle, let him look for her, but then I would be holding a stranger's kid. I looked around frantically, evaluating my options. The only thing I could think of was distracting him with the window. I slid up the window covering so he could see outside. It was haunting. No clouds in sight to obscure the view. An incomprehensible height, so far from the natural world, where man is meant to be. It was a bad distraction as well, the view entertained him for a few minutes before realizing it was more fun to open and close the cover. The slow flashing of the bright sky, coupled with a glimpse into the end with every opening was maddening.

 Maybe a compassionate stranger complained, or the flight attendant just took notice, but she approached me with a proposal. She asked if I would like to be upgraded to first class to give my seat to the boy's mother. I naturally accepted. 

The walk to first class was awkward, shaking the pinprick numbness in my legs, and trying desperately not to rub my tailbone. What I couldn’t shake was the knowledge that beneath my feet was nothing but air. Nothing but a shear drop outside of this tin can. 

Through the curtain to first class was a much prettier scene. Individual cubbies, their exterior trimmed with rippled aluminum cladding. Each cubby privatized with curtains of their own: beautiful blue velvet, with gold fringed borders. One of the curtains was open; exposing a man in a formal suit, his tie undone, and buttons popped. Stuffed to the brim and comatosed, after having gorged himself on a roasted bird. It was 

quiet and elegant up here, not a child's crying to be heard. 

Where I was going; however, stood out from these booths. Stood out in the way that it blended in: there wasn’t a curtain to identify it; there wasn’t much of a door either. The flight attendant slid a card down a thin seam that, if you were looking for it, could be seen running from floor to ceiling. Grabbing onto the outer ridge and moving it leftwards, the wall folded in on itself, squeezing against the wall like a collapsable fan. She moved out of the way and presented the room with a show of her hand: a sweet lavender smell rushed out of the doorway, trying desperately to fill the first class’s, scentless vacuum. I slowly pressed in, careful not to disturb the sanctuary's atmosphere.

“Make yourself comfortable, it’s all yours.” She slid the door closed behind me and the room worked to replenish its aroma. 

Contrary to the minimalist aluminum that sheathed the plane inside and out, the interior of this room was wooden. Slat panels with acoustic foam underneath: the only light coming from red strips where the plane's cylindrical body requires the wall to slope inwards. The reminder that I was, in fact, on a plane, caused my stomach to sink; an unexpected blow after a period of tranquility. My momentary comfort only ensured the impact hurt worse when I fell from my pedestal. The room fought to draw me back in: it whispered classical music into my ears from an unseen source. 

In the center of the room was a round, solo dining table; stained dark and well polished: a napkin folded into the shape of a bird sat as the centerpiece. The accompanying seat looked to be a massage chair: leg nooks, a cubic brutalist body, and wrapped in maroon leather. Most of the wall behind it was dedicated to a water feature; one that had a thin waterfall that ran down a pane of tempered glass. Flowing down into a trough where large, flowered, lily pads jiggled around on top of the water, and red LEDs shown from below. 

I sunk into the chair, engulfed in its fluff, and surrounded by rubber pistons. Embedded into the armrest was a control panel, far more settings than on a mall chair; and luckily the absence of a cash slot. The buttons were not easy to discern however; all were different glowing colors, with white, seemingly random symbols on their faces. As I went through clicking the buttons, some connection could be gleaned between their symbol and function. The horizontal zigzag activated the massager, the turtle and rabbit buttons controlled speed, three wavy vertical lines were the heater, and the exclamation mark was to call in a flight attendant. I only realized the last one when a lady walked in, as I was whincing at the chair's, borderline painful massage feature. 

""Is the room to your liking?"" she asked. 

""Oh definitely, it's very nice. This is all very unexpected. I feel kinda outta place. Don’t get me wrong I appreciate it—it’s just, yeah, unexpected”

“You aren’t out of place at all, it was reserved for you."" She said with a consistent cadence, happy, but not enthusiastic; and a thin smile that wasn’t overbearingly consumer friendly, but definitely choreographed. She spoke very hushed, and matter-of-factly. 

""How's that? I bought the cheapest ticket I could."" 

""Well, it was selected at 'random'."" She said while using airquotes. 

""What does ‘random’ mean?"" 

""It’s determined by a computer, so as ‘random’ as they can be. There's still code and statistics involved, it’s not drawing sticks, but it does help us find you.” 

“Is there a reason for this?"" 

“The room or the ritual?” She asked with a lifted brow.

“The what now? A ritual?”

“I probably shouldn’t have called it that, the company likes to call it a ‘transaction’.” She said using air quotes again.

“Well what is the transaction!” My tone rising and becoming desperate.

“It’s just something that has to be done.” She said putting her hands up and backing up a couple of steps. ""A company policy, for safety reasons I think. I don’t know specifics, the captain usually gives the rundown by now; he can explain it better than me.” Stepping back further.

“You have to tell me more, you can’t say that then leave.”

“I-I’ll see if I can get the captain. Hang tight for a second.” She said with an increasingly shaky voice, before quickly spinning around, her Farrah Fawcett hair flinging over her shoulder as she dashed to the door. The sound of the door closing was followed by multiple and simultaneous locks moving into place.

I paced around the room waiting for the man to come: my mind was running through a rolodex of possible rituals. If she even meant it in the ghoulish, sacrifice a virgin way, she could’ve meant a tradition. I really needed a release, it felt like I was going to choke on my anxiety, so I figured it was as good a time as any to pick a drink off the wall. Across from the table was a shelved wall stocked with a large selection of alcohol. All were in ornate decanters, the names of the contents etched into a gold plaque in front of them. It's not much of an exaggeration to say the collection contained every intoxicating beverage. There were many high end liquors, easily worth..I don’t even know how much; then a few were filled with cheap, working man's beer.

As I poured myself a drink, three gentle knocks came from the door. After giving them the okay to come in, the captain slid open the door; gave me a chipper hello, and held out his hand to shake mine. I did not reciprocate. He had thick grey hair, from the looks of his mustache and curly mullet that poofed out from his tall, sturdy hat.

""What do you think about the room?"" He asked with a rancher’s twang in a slightly raspy voice.

“I want to know why I’m in here.”

“I apologize for this, transaction, being revealed to you in that way. Rosie is..well, she’s a bit ditsy I suppose. Lose her head if it weren’t screwed to her body kinda girl. I think it goes over better coming from my buttery smooth voice.” He said with a chuckle. 

“Can you cut to it, this is maddening.”

“Yes you’re right, enough beaten around the horse.” He sighed and rolled his eyes before locking them back to mine. Their blue color fading into a grey as well. “Look, every flight we are obligated to do this. It ain’t pretty, but the consequences are far worse. Okay?” Looking at me with those wide, piercing eyes.

“Yes?”

“Somebody, on every flight, in this case you, has to eat a baby. Alright?”

“No, not alright. What are you talking about?”

“Listen, I know how you feel; I was in your spot once; so has my co-pilot, and most of the flight attendants. A whole hell of a lot of folks have been in your shoes. None of us liked it. Well most of us didn’t like it, but that’s just how it is.”

“You’re full of shit. This can’t be true”

“Nuh uh, this is definitely real. This is how it’ll go, when you agree to our terms, the chef will…”

“I’m not listening to this, I’m shutting you down, la la la la” He grabbed my side, right under my ribs and squeezed tight. I whimpered and grabbed his hand to try to push it away but his grip was deadlocked. 

“Now would you cut that out, what I’m trying to tell you is important. I can’t stress enough how crucial this duty is. Are you willing to be civilized if I let you go?”

“Yes..” I said between blowing spastic breaths through my reddening cheeks.

“When you agree, the chef will come in, prepare the meal, and you will eat the whole thing, all before we land.”

“What happens if I don't?”

""The landing gear will malfunction, it’ll only partially deploy. When we touch down we will tip, port side, the left wing will touch ground, and break off bit by bit until it reaches the engine. An explosion will ensue that’ll set the blades free; where they will rip into the cabin, slaughtering everyone in its path. We will lose all footing and the nose will plunge into the ground. First class will crumple instantly; the body will be split at the midsection; the rear will flip over seven times until it collapses. There will be only one survivor. You.""

""That’s..not true."" I had nothing else to say, I could barely get those words out as the scenario played out in front of my eyes. Like a film scrolling across them, a reel of a thousand frames, displaying the most vile scene. The horrifying sight, a stark reality, but brought on by a barbaric fable. Just a masochist’s tale.

""The chef will be in to prepare dinner shortly."" he said, patting the table and hoisting himself up, a series of brittle pops came from his knee. He brushed off his pant leg and strode out lankily through that deceptive door. I envied that freedom. The room never felt so small, and it was only becoming more cramped. 

I could still see the door’s seam, just as hidden as when I first came in, but now the ridges didn’t give as I tugged. Maybe it wasn’t there, I moved from groove to groove, pulling on each one. I scaled the wall like a mad man, pulling in places I knew it couldn’t be, but had no choice but to try anyway. I pounded on the door, throwing my body against it a few times until I bruised. I screamed, calling for someone who could not hear me, or would not care. The world outside the door was silent, as I was to them, for that time I didn’t exist and neither did they. That is a horrid and insoluble isolation. When my over exertion gave way to lightheadedness I involuntarily slide down the wall. Through blurry eyes and a swiveling head I tried to ground myself, but the fog only grew. I felt feverish, as if my eyes could water and sink into my burning face. Then came an unnatural drowsiness; like my weighted blanket made its way up to my face and was smothering me. Naturally the darkness gave way to sleep.

I regained consciousness all at once, a prick in the inner pit of my elbow sending a zap of urgency into my heart. A bulbous nose and a dark, thick, mustache filled my frame of vision. When he put some space between us, I could see those features belonged to a robust man in a chefs attire, holding a syringe. 

Trying to squirm only amounted to the realization that I had been bound to the chair. My hands were duct taped in one large, bulbous mass, my exposed fingers stuck to a knife in my left, and a fork in my right. 

The man walked over to the kitchenette; flicking keys around a ring, sifting through a hoard of them to find the few he needed. One buy one he unlocked units of the kitchen that I couldn’t get into. The hanging cupboard and minifridge on either side a tiered display of spices between them. The man put on an apron, a white fluffy hat; then turned to me. A wide smile on his face, silicon molded dimples on full display: brightly lit by his ivory veneers, one of which had disappeared, the tiny shaved remnants of his true tooth on full display. And his eyes squinted shut; likely the result of botox losing its potency; his puffy dark eyelids left sitting awkwardly on smooth, pearshaped cheeks. 

""What'll it be?"" he said. ""Soup or Salad?"" in a very heavy, coarse accent. 

""Go fuck yourself."" I said before thrashing around to no avail. My biceps were taped against my chest, a zip tie joining my arms at the elbow: and my legs were clamped tight in their massaging nooks. 

""no no. Not a option. Soup or Salad."" 

""I’m not eating anything. I don’t know what sick game you are playing, but I’m not a part of it."" 

“But you see, this is no game. It’s ah..a requirement, you can understand that.""

“No I cannot. I don’t understand how someone can eat a child.”

""You are not eating the baby yet. Just appetizers to start."" 

""Like I said, I’m not eating."" 

""The soup is a very fresh Gnocchi, with ingredients straight from the homeland. Or the crisp caprese salad, also grown from the fertile fields of home.” 

“Where are you from?”

“Across the sea.”

“That applies to everyone.”

“Me most of all.”

I figured it was not worth acknowledging him; that paying attention to him would become maddening: like realizing a gnat is buzzing around your ear and no longer able to ignore it.

 ""I know what you want, the salad, yes?""...""Excellent choice!"" 

He opened a metal compartment which released a mist that snuck out around the edges. Chilled ingredients were sorted on the compact shelves. With expert speed he chopped and tossed the salad, placing it on the table with an extended arm, before folding it behind his back and finishing with a bow.

""Say when."" he said, grating a block of cheese into the bowl. Whether it came from the man, cheese or salad I couldn’t decide, but a pungent smell hit me all at once. Even when the block of cheese was shredded in its entirety into my salad I didn't say a word.

 ""Oh my friend, I hope you chew thoroughly. This may be no bueno on its way out."" he said with a deep laugh, and returned to his station. After dropping the grater and some other dishes in the sink he clapped his hands together and said his goodbyes. 

""Au revoir mon ami, I do hope you enjoy. I’ll begin dinner when you're ready."" 

""I'm telling you now, I’m not gonna be ready."" 

""Ah, I have a hunch that you will be."" 

The next 20 minutes crawled by. Thrashing around in my seat had no noticeable effect on my restraints. Despite my forearms having some mobility, my range of motion only allowed my to move my useless hands to my face. The sharp golden utinzels in my hand were just a bait, telling I could cut myself loose. In reality all I could do was bring them straight up to my face; which did provide an out if it came to that. 

""It looks like you haven't touched your salad. Is it no good?"" He said when he returned.

""I told you I wasn't eating it."" 

""Then you must be saving your appetite for the main course, yes?"" 

""No."" 

""I will prepare the meal anyway. The smell of food always brings out hunger."" 

Opening the mysterious remaining cabinet beside the spice rack, with two gentle hands the chef reached in for something. From out of it he pulled a little mass of cloth, pulling it into the crease of his arms and readjusting its weight. He turned around and in a very soft tone he said. 

""Do you have any allergies?"" 

In his arms was a: plump, blond, sleeping baby, swaddled in a blanket. 

""Oh my god.. It's real.. It's really happening"" I said under my breath.

""I pride myself on never having allergized one of my guests, I want that to continue."" 

I can only imagine I was stark white, with bulging eyes and a slacked jaw, that’s how I felt anyway. An anxiety welling up inside me, far more deep and poignant than what had plagued me hours ago. Those feelings seemed so trivial now. What I would give to be a cowering, small man, in my economy seat again. 

""No allergies? Excellent, the preparations can begin."" 

He plugged the sink and began filling it with water. 

“How can you do this? This is sick, all of this.”

“Somebody has to do it. I have to prepare the meal. You have to eat it. Like it or not, it must be done.”

""I won’t eat it. You'll be killing him for nothing."" 

""Her, actually. That's all that we know. She has no name. No family. No identification. Seven people knows she exists. Nobody will know she's gone."" 

I began to cry. My head falling as far as my restraints would allow, and I sobbed with choking gasps. 

""you can't...you can't do it.."" 

He turned off the sink and looked at me with a viscous scowl, the first time he's dropped the chipper persona. 

""You are unreasonable."" 

He placed the baby back in the cupboard, slapped its door shut and stormed out of the room. I continued to weep even though a slight relief developed, thinking I got out of it. The pressure put on me, and the evil this room has concealed, still crushing me. It felt tainted, a sour putrid air, under the veil of lavender vapor. The smell, I thought was just a placebo, my mind molding the room into my narrative, but something was definitely seeping into the room. 

At first it made my mouth feel foamy; like it was drying out, and a mucky film remained. Then it was arid; a bitter taste like a dentist's numbing paste, laid on top of my sandpaper tongue. The draught moved down my throat, sucking air out with it: it wasn't long before a hiccup like gasp flared up under my sternum. I choked and I coughed, a series of convulsions working to bring something up from inside of me. I started to vomit, spewing from my nose at the first release, the stinging was horrid and the sight was repulsive. The bile seeping in between my clamped thighs. While the vomiting was unpleasant, the dry heaving was torturous. My empty stomach had no more to give; but the gagging carried on. 

At some point the classical music died out, whether it was before my gagging fit or during, I didn’t notice; but when musical ambiance was reintroduced into the room, it was impossible to ignore. Heavy metal, at a headache inducing volume, snapped into the room full bore. I don’t remember what was played in between, but the torture begun with Slayer and ended with Disturbed

Gallons of sweat poured out of me; soaking me in my DIY leather bound sauna. My man-made lubrication proved ineffective in my attempt to slip free: although my efforts had become lackluster; only energy left to swing my head around. I never passed out, that would’ve been a blessing. I danced so close to the land between heat exhaustion, and suffocation: always to be pulled back, into a state of gas induced bulimia. Eventually the gasping did end, far beyond the last point I could’ve been grateful. My whole body was dry, wrung out and depleted of moisture: my sweat soaked body had evaporated, leaving behind a meat scent on my crunchy clothes. 

I barely noticed that someone had entered the room, until my head was pushed into the leather headrest. My crusty, bloodshot eyes fought to see through the grain and piercing light. An unexpected stream of liquid hit them in the pupil and finally caught their attention. Prying hands pulled open my mouth and shot the stream down my throat, no stopping when it grazed my uvulae. I blinked my eyes clear, and hacked water at the hands until they left my mouth. Finally able to see two flight attendants, wearing thin plastic ponchos, over their tightly pressed uniforms. 

""Have you decided to do it yet?"" One asked; a squirt bottle in hand. 

Still drippling and spitting up the excess water I hacked a glob at his shoes, hitting it right in the toe. He clenched his teeth, then his hands, and busted me in the cheek. 

""Mike! We aren't supposed to do that. You'll bruise your knuckles"". The female attendant said, placing a concerned hand on his crinkly shoulder. 

""Let's just get this over with.” He said, while pulling up his ankle and furiously taking a handkerchief to his shoe.

The lady walked to a metal cart they had wheeled in: a dinky thing with four slender legs, and two shelves holding only a few items. She carefully slipped on two oversized leather gloves, flapping the loose fingers around like an old cathers mit. She scrunched the fingers around the tiny handle on an aluminum tray. Steam poured out around the edge of the lid as she opened it: some wrapping around her forearm, urging her to yank away; murmuring obscenities under her breath. 

With long tongs, she reached into the tray and pulled out a folded blue towel, giving it a little shake, before making her strut back to me. 

""This is your last opportunity. We land in two hours. It'll take most of that time for dinner to be prepared and served. We hope you realize what's at stake here."" The lady said. 

""We’re sure you are a rational man. You can do the math, this is one life to ensure the safety of 90."" The man added 

""If ‘morality’ is the cause of your hangup, you must find it immoral to let 90 innocent passengers die"". Said she, it becoming clear at this point they intended to alternate dialogue.

""Deaths that you are aware will occur, as a product of your inaction."" 

""You will not be able to plead ignorance in the life that follows. The blood will stain your hands alone."" 

My breathing had become choppy, not as much from physical torture, but of that going on in my head. Proof that my tear ducts were once again operational, tears fell down my face, mixing into the open wound on my left cheek, and down the blood stream that collected under my chin. 

""I can't do it."" I said between sobs 

""Damn."" The woman said before grabbing my mess of hair and yanking my head back. The red ceiling lights became eclipsed by the blue towel hovering over my face. The tongs released and it slapped onto my face. The sequence of events moved so quickly it took a second for the pain to fully manifest. The heat grew from warm,to unpleasant, to searing. I tried to shake it off but the hand left my hair and grabbed the ends of the towels, snagging it tight around my face. The suffocation went unnoticed while the 2nd degree burn was fresh.

An immediate cooling soothed my face briefly; cold water washing over the burns. The sensation of bliss lasted a moment before the water found my airways. The towel was ripped away, dribblets of water and flesh trailing in the air after it. Intense pain rippled across my face with every hack and cough, trying to clear water from my throat. Bubbling masses coming into view around the edges of my eyes: blisters rising without hesitation. 

""This can end whenever you want!"" The woman said, holding the towel near her chest. 

I had no reserved air to respond with, all I could do was shake my head. Though the torture was unbareable, it was what I deserved. If I would be the only one to crawl through this plane's debris, over the bodies of people I could've saved, I was willing to pay for it. 

The torment went on like that for, god knows how long. The world was reduced to sensations; as if my mind only extended as far as my body. I knew more was out there, but in my restraints, and subdued by my torturers, I was the only person in a tight void. The only relevance time had to me was the hope that I could run out their clock. 

They eventually removed the towel for the last time, and put themselves back together, to resume their facade for the passengers. It didn't matter much anymore, how the passengers saw them, or if they even carried on with their job. There wasn't enough time for dinner. Our fate was sealed. 

I was in paralysis for the remainder of the trip. We hit patches of turbulence periodically, any disturbance felt as if it could’ve been the last. None of it startled me, the extent of my acknowledgement was feeling my head bob and sway around. I experienced something I rarely ever did: complete complacency. 

No smooth words, great performance, bribe, promise, or wish, would change what was coming. A terrible thing, but it was inevitable now. It was just me, and a short stretch of time before the course of my life would be split in two. It was absolute clarity without the peace. Moreso a desperate acceptance; the terms were very grim, but I made a choice. 

I likely could've escaped in that time. My restraints had become waterlogged and lost much of their grip. With enough thrashing they could've come undone; but where to go after that? That is the horror of an aircraft, the hopelessness that comes when you board. People have no clue where the real horror lies. People have no clue about the room nestled near the cockpit, where a dinner is forced on a passenger every flight. 

A buttery smooth voice entered the room like spoiled milk. The pilot's voice came over the entercom. 

""Ladies and Gentlemen, we are beginning to make our descent. The local time is 3:19, and the sky is clear. We want to thank you for flying with us today, and wish you safe travels ahead."" 

Then a flight attendant entered the room. Clacking her heels towards me before placing a hand on my shoulder and shoving my back into the seat. My eyes met hers, and she spoke through gritted teeth. 

""I hope you're happy. Mr. Lucky. Make sure to live it up, for us."" 

She reached over me, to grab a bottle of liquor. She pulled out a scattering of loose pills, and scarfed them all down. Flicking the decanters plug off with her thumb she took a big swig, some trickling out the sides of her mouth. Wiping her face clean she walked to the far wall, pressing her back to it and sliding down to the floor. 

""The Captain said I could if I stayed in here. I want to be out cold before we land."" 

Other flight attendants entered, also pouring themselves drinks and lying on the floor as we made our way closer to the ground. They berated me for what I did to them: cursed my name, put hex’s on my bloodline. I only felt pity for them. If this was how they wanted to spend their final moments, I would allow it. I thought it was a true display of their character, to end their lives like that. Letting their cruelness seep out. The finality of the death bed, does have a way of revealing truths. The most raw look at someone's life, and how it consistently ends. I wanted to die with my morality intact: I lost that the moment I booked this flight. 

Our ears began popping and we knew we were getting close. The pill popper had already faded away, others were severely wasted, and sobbing came from the ones who only managed a buzz. The wheels touched the ground hard. An anticipated feeling, but was impossible to prepare for. Multiple bounces up and down as the tires made contact, only to lose its footing right after. It rattled my empty stomach; its deep, hollow ache returning after a long absence. The tilting took longer than expected, it could’ve been happening without our knowledge. But the anticipation only grew, the dread becoming unbearable, for an event everyone assumed to be instant. The plane sturdied itself, and the force pressing on our bodies lightened. We were slowing down. Not the violent slowing of the wing scrapping tar, it was completely mechanical. Even as the plane drove around the landing strips, slowly taking corners, we couldn't be certain the accident was avoided. If fate was at play, an unexpected and contrived sequence of events could take place any moment. But the plane docked. The captain came into the room, summoning the attendants to assist the passengers as they exited. 

""It didn't happen."" one of the attendants said with a flabbergasted expression, ""This has never happened."" 

""My god."" another said, ""Was it a lie? Did I do it for nothing!"" She clutched her face and began to sob. 

The pilot quickly shooed the in-tact attendants out of the room, shutting the door behind them. He stepped over the sobber who had sprawled herself across the floor, with her face pressed against the wood: her muffled sobs trickled out between the cracks, as did her tears. Taking a tiny pair of scissors out of his pocket he started to cut at the duct tape. 

""This will take a while. I can't bring anything larger on board. You know how strict the rules are."" 

""We didn't crash. You were lying."" I said

""I was not. This is unexpected. Incredibly rare."" 

""That's bullshit. Why would this flight be the one that's spared?"" 

""It's not our place to know, or ask. This is a blessing, count it as one. And tread lightly, charity comes at a cost to someone."" 

He finished cutting at my bonds, I stretched and squeezed my hands to regain the feeling that I had done so long without. They shook as I, numb and feebly pulled at the dangling tape. It was a laborious task that I knew going into it I wouldn't finish. I stood up with strips still clung to me; bunching up the back of my jacket, and tucked into my pants. I was covered in the residual stickiness, the blotchy film that remains, even after paint has been torn from the walls. My smell was atrocious too, layers of sweat and B.O. with a bile finish. It would soon be masked though.

The pilot came in with a half filled coffee pot. From an arms length away he stopped walking and flung it my way. The coffee sloshed out, and engulfed my face. As it wrapped around my head I braced for the scorching to set in, but it was only mild. No more pain than if anything touched my already peeled, and blistered face. As it settled in, it proved to be incredibly thick and dark; like laundry detergent stained black. 

""It's been on the burner for a very long time. We call it diesel, thick as oil and will have you running all night."" He said. 

""What's your fucking problem?"" I asked as I shook beads of the slop off my hands, and fanned out my soaked shirt. 

""When you get off the plane, head to the medical station and tell them about your accident. Then call our company, file a complaint and show them your face. They will apologize, promise to brew the coffee colder, and pay you off."" 

""People have to know what happened here. They'll stop flying if they do."" 

""You know people won't stop flying. This tech is a miracle. Even with the baggage that comes with it."" 

Two flight attendants returned, having escorted everyone else off the plane. 

""Would you two carry her to the medics?” Nudging the unconscious woman with his foot. “Bring our volunteer with you while you're at it."" The pilot said, placing a firm hand on my damp shoulder. I swatted it off and gathered up my things as the attendants held the woman in the air, one at her feet, the other under her shoulders. Her hands dragged the entire way, we stopped a few times to cross them over her body but they always fell again. 

I sat in the medics station for a while, all it amounted to was giving me a change of clothes, and ice for my face. They said I would have to be transferred to a nearby hospital for real treatment. As I waited for the squad to arrive, I used the time to reach out to my family. I knew my mom would be antsy to know how the flight went, but more urgently I had to tell them what hospital I was going to. When I turned my phone off of airplane mode I received a wall of notifications, with numerous missed calls, and texts from my family. I called my mom back, ringing multiple times, before a soft, quiet, hello picked up. 

""Hey Mom, what's going on?"" 

""Did you just land?"" she asked. 

""Yeah a little bit ago, I'm still at the airport. Is everything alright?"" 

""Your Dad started getting really bad a couple hours ago. His throat is very swollen with an infection, and it could lead to pneumonia. They put him on a ventilator, and we’re waiting for the swelling to go down so they can remove some of the fluid. If he goes in for surgery, it’ll be very risky, and they want us to see him, in case, it doesn’t go well.""

I don’t “walk.”

Why would you bring me an activity that literally has WALK in the name? That’s like handing a vegan a brisket menu and calling it “a fun suggestion.”

Also, you can’t walk in a river! You have to swim, which I can’t do either! Kyle is so insensitive!

Clearly, she has lived much longer. She lives with my husband and me, and she is still able to go to the restroom and fix herself a cup of coffee on her own. She is exhausted when she sits back down. She has pain that is controlled, and she is declining at a slow rate. My fear is that Hospice will kick her out. She does not have the strength to be driven to a doctor or to sit in a waiting room.

Dear Agent,

I am seeking representation for my 75,000 word science fiction novel *What Keeps the Stars Apart*. *What Keeps the Stars Apart* combines galactic scale, several timelines, and multiple points of view with emotionally intimate prose and characters in a similar style to *The Vanished Birds* by Simon Jimenez while incorporating the apocalyptic stakes of *Stars and Bones* by Gareth L. Powell.

In the distant future, humanity has spread to hundreds of star systems, but it has been a slow crawl, the harsh limitation of the speed of light never having been circumvented. Civilizations under different suns go through their own crises and emerge—or perish—entirely alone. Devised in the face of this paradigm was the program of Galactic History Preservation. 

Amir Younis is the Astronomer, one of five academics aboard the GHP vessel *Absolution*. The *Absolution* traverses the cold void between the stars with its crew in a state of cryogenic fugue that suspends the aging process, allowing them to wake for a short time in each system to do their research and update their records, recording humanity’s fragmented history in a continuous, interstellar narrative.

The Astronomer and their crew approach a system where their records indicate that an interplanetary civilization flourished mere thousands of years ago. Upon entering the system, they are faced with evidence of a complete apocalypse—unfortunate, but not unprecedented. But when the crew’s geological survey of the homeworld shows no record of anthropomorphic habitation anywhere in the planet’s deep past, the system evolves from a graveyard to a paradox. As the crew races against the clock of galactic extinction to solve this mystery, they stumble upon a deeper secret—their memories have been stolen from them. While the Astronomer works to recover humanity’s future and their own past, they must determine if the truth will truly set them free, or if it will destroy them.

\[Bio/Personalization\]

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely,

Name

\#

First 300:

The Astronomer woke to silence. Right on cue, their cryogenic sleeping pod had initiated waking procedures as the *Absolution* decelerated into the Alpha-8457 star system. The rest of the crew still slept. The chance of pod failure was less than ten-thousand to one—it had to be—but still the Astronomer checked every one, running manual diagnostics each time. It was habit. When you spent thousands of years adrift in the emptiness between the stars, habit was all you had—that, and your crew. They all came back green. 

Everyone on a Galactic History Preservation team got used to traveling in cryosleep, but no one ever came to like it. If they did, the Astronomer thought, their psych profile should probably be reevaluated. A person taking the long nap was biologically almost dead, and they woke up feeling that way.

After the head, the Astronomer’s first stop was at the autodoc. They drank a liter of water and, needing something with a little more kick than coffee, took some mild amphetamines prescribed by the system. Other than the temporary brain fog, their body appeared perfectly ship-shape. The Biologist would have gently chided that the human body is an enormously complex organism and that keeping it working nearly perfectly for thousands of years was a miracle that should never be taken for granted. But she was asleep, so fuck biology. The Astronomer took more amphetamines and moved on to what had long ago become their favorite part of being conscious—long, hot showers.

She knew I wasn’t staying long. I asked her out, and the date was amazing — she was funny, caring, sweet. When my drink was empty, she shared hers; when I finished my food quickly, she shared that too. She’s really beautiful, and honestly I had an erection while we were sitting in the restaurant.

I invited her on a second date at my place and said I’d cook dinner. She agreed, but with the condition that it would only be dinner — I said okay. We cooked together, laughed a lot, she helped with the dishes, it was really cute. Then we sat down to watch a movie. I didn’t touch her and she didn’t touch me, but there was tension. At some point we kissed. Before that I asked her if she was sure, and told her we’d stop anytime if she didn’t want to. She said we could keep going. She also told me she’d only had sex once, last year, and that she was scared of the pain.

I tried to go really slowly, but it was hard to enter, and we had to stop several times. I comforted her, she kept apologizing, saying she was nervous and couldn’t relax. In the end we had sex about three times during the night, but honestly I wanted more, though it was painful for her. Afterward we cuddled, slept hugging, she kissed my cheek and ran her fingers through my hair. In the morning I was turned on again, and when she woke up I started touching her and tried to get her aroused, but it was even more painful for her. She tried to give me a handjob but I told her I can’t finish from that, only from sex or a blowjob. She refused both and I asked for anal and she refused that too. Then I asked if I could finish on her chest and she agreed.

After that we showered separately. I offered breakfast, a walk, coffee to-go, and to walk her to the metro. She suddenly shut down nothing was left of the fun, warm girl from the day before. She answered with one word at a time. I brought up the previous night and told her she didn’t owe me anything, that a kiss doesn’t mean she’s obligated to have sex, and that her “no” is enough to stop, she never has to tolerate pain. She said it was great I said that not many guys know it. She also said she was brave for coming to my place, that it’s a risk for women. I said I felt her tense up inside during penetration. She said she was nervous because it was only her second time ever, the last time was a year ago, and she never goes to a stranger’s home like that. There was some regret in her voice.

I asked if she was glad she had sex. She said: I don’t know, I didn’t understand, I was in pain most of the time. Then we walked for coffee in silence, it was awkward, she didn’t initiate conversation and stayed closed off. Then she asked something about my job and we talked a bit. I walked her to the metro and we kissed goodbye.

The next day I texted her. I had just passed an exam and told her. She congratulated me and asked if I was celebrating. I said no. I asked how she was doing, she said she had a lot of work. Then I told her if she wanted a quick schmus she could come over and that I was very chill today — and she blocked me.

I don’t understand what went wrong. Why the drama if she came to my place herself, knew what she was doing, and what’s the problem with coming over again and just having fun? She knew I was leaving soon and that my career was starting. She consciously went into this so what’s the issue?",2,1765224739.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False
1phmvs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1phmvs8/we_have_to_eat_a_baby_every_time_we_land_a_plane/,We have to eat a baby every time we land a plane,"I arrived at the airport at the recommended time, 2 hours before departure; weary and anxious about the 6-hour flight ahead of me. Over the course of my life, I've managed to avoid flying with an iron vigor: despite the many situations it reared its ugly head into. I would drive three days straight, with only power naps to get me by, if it meant I didn't have to fly there. A feat I’ve taken many times. This recent predicament left me very few options; which driving was not one. 

While eating at a Golden Corral, my dad got a wishbone lodged in his windpipe. By the time they got it dislodged he was already a shade of violet and lacking oxygen in his brain. While stable now, he might not be for very long: leaving this state of urgency. And the prospect that, if I don't see him now, I may never again. Thus, my FOMO negated my fear of flying, and forced my hand into buying a ticket.

I trembled all the way through TSA, and the long walk to my gate: practically fossilized in my seat by the time my section was called to board. I whipped out my phone, my boarding pass illuminated on its greasy screen. I wasn't even sure how long I stood there trying to scan my pass; my shaky hands making the code impossible to read. The ramp operator took special notice of me when the barcode was read. She must've noticed my petrification. 

""We really appreciate you"". She said with an uncurated genuinity in her tone. 

""Uh..thanks. I appreciate you too"" 

I thought about the exchange down the entire ramp, was I weird or was she. Nobody could've expected her to say that. Nobody would've had a response prepared. Like a miscalculated: “You too.”, in response to a, “Enjoy the show.”, at a ticket booth. Hopefully my face would be lost in the mass of people she sees everyday. 

When I came face to face with the plane's door; I ground the line of passengers to a halt. My eyes were fixed to the gap between the ramp and plane. The sound of engines and wind so loud, through just half a foot of space. Already we were so high up. I could fall through the gap if I was 90lbs lighter: break my ankle on impact. I snapped back to reality, and knew it was socially unexceptable to stand here any longer. The groans of the other passengers grew ever clear, along with the act of a kid tugging on his mom's dress, asking why we were waiting. If that kid isn't afraid, I shouldn't be either. I had no choice but to pass through the Gate to Hell, and join the Army of the Damned. 

As I stepped over the gap it's as if my soul did slip out of me; straight through it: just a skid mark on the tarmac. My confidence was already ailing. 

Then the wheel on my suitcase got caught on the outside of the door. I started tugging and twisting; looking back to assess the problem only to be met with a dozen or so faces, watching hatefully. With a hardy yank my carry-on was freed, one less wheel, and a date with the dump when this trip was over. I couldn't even look the flight attendants in the eyes when I rounded the corner, and started down the aisle to my seat. 

When I made it to my row the three seats were empty. Which brought a slight sense of relief, as my seat, was in my middle. I thought maybe, I would get the chance to take an Advil PM, and sprawl out across the seats. I was clenched into my seat for only a few minutes, when my rowmate to my left arrived. 

He was a portly man: adorned with a Cannibal Corpse shirt, full tattoo sleeve, and skull sandals. Despite what I may have expected him to be like, he ended up being rather friendly: simply greeting me, and plopping into his seat. His smell became a bit hard to bear. It was like: a very masculine, mahogany forest cologne, with a dusting of baby powder. Under normal circumstances, I likely wouldn't have noticed; but my stomach already in knots, and my senses heightened; the scent was very nauseating.

The arrival of my rowmate to the right, nearly made me flip my lid. It was a child. Roughly six or seven, his mom pushed him to our row, and turned his head from his tablet to his seat. The man and I had to get up to make way for the kid; carefully stepping in the spaces between our bags. The kid paid no mind to our bags however, stepping on mine bag to get to his seat. His mom had only enough energy to scold him in a defeated exclamation. With the gifting of a, tablet she parted ways; squeezing her way back up the aisle; so many rows away; too far to call for help. 

The depth of the situation was becoming dire; like I’m 20 leagues under the sea and the pressure is about to blow in the hall. The kid started watching a video of a man, with a painfully obnoxious voice, playing some children's game. It became quickly evident that the kid, did not have headphones; and I would have to listen to his videos until the tablet died. Who knows what torture would come after the tablet died. 

The Captain eventually introduced himself, and gave his words of reassurance that, despite the six hour flight ahead of us, there will be no problems along the way. Then came the safety demonstration from the flight attendants; the display was sickening. They tried to be humorous, to relieve tension, or amuse us: I’m not sure but it didn’t work. Just a stark reminder that a life jacket and breathing mask, doesn’t fare well against high altitude combustion. Nor would it be helpful if I was flung from the plane. It's rock from start to finish; when I meet the ground at mach 10 speeds, the life jacket would be an orange lump in a red puddle. 

Takeoff was horrible. My fingers bored wedges into the ends of the arm rests; latched to them like I was riding a roller coaster. The pressure in my ears sunk into a faint ring, until they popped thirty minutes into the flight. By that time, the man in the aisle seat was already knocked out. As it turns out, he had horrible sleep apnea. His head would be flopped back, mouth wide open, really letting his snore travel through the cabin. Sometimes he would choke, his tongue falling back into his throat, forcing him to burst awake when his body realized he was dying. The first time this happened, his arm flung out and hit me: I let out a yelp that disturbed everyone around us further. He apologized, but before he seemed to finish his sentence, he was back asleep: head slumped over his shoulder, facing me. I tried to push it away with my pointer finger, but it always rolled its way back; eventually slumping onto my shoulder, that's when I really pushed him away. The second time he choked himself awake, a flight attendant had just rolled the cart through, having to lift his head out of the aisle to get past him. The sample of pepsi she had given me, made its way onto me when the man knocked it out of my hands. 

""I'm so sorry man, I didn't mean to"". The man said as I used my sleeve to pat dribblets of pepsi off my face. He was slumped over snoring again immediately after. 

The kid was still glued to his tablet; his neck craned over, as it sat in his lap. The poor kid was doomed to have a turtles neck when he reached his golden years: shoulders all slouched, connected to the collar with a protruding spiny bump. The dreaded moment arrived too soon, his tablet died; he wasted no time to ask for his mom. Tugging on my sleeve, seeing if I knew where she was. I told him she was in front of us, but it must not have registered, as he continued to ask. I didn't know what to do, I thought I could just pick him up and set him in the aisle, let him look for her, but then I would be holding a stranger's kid. I looked around frantically, evaluating my options. The only thing I could think of was distracting him with the window. I slid up the window covering so he could see outside. It was haunting. No clouds in sight to obscure the view. An incomprehensible height, so far from the natural world, where man is meant to be. It was a bad distraction as well, the view entertained him for a few minutes before realizing it was more fun to open and close the cover. The slow flashing of the bright sky, coupled with a glimpse into the end with every opening was maddening.

 Maybe a compassionate stranger complained, or the flight attendant just took notice, but she approached me with a proposal. She asked if I would like to be upgraded to first class to give my seat to the boy's mother. I naturally accepted. 

The walk to first class was awkward, shaking the pinprick numbness in my legs, and trying desperately not to rub my tailbone. What I couldn’t shake was the knowledge that beneath my feet was nothing but air. Nothing but a shear drop outside of this tin can. 

Through the curtain to first class was a much prettier scene. Individual cubbies, their exterior trimmed with rippled aluminum cladding. Each cubby privatized with curtains of their own: beautiful blue velvet, with gold fringed borders. One of the curtains was open; exposing a man in a formal suit, his tie undone, and buttons popped. Stuffed to the brim and comatosed, after having gorged himself on a roasted bird. It was 

quiet and elegant up here, not a child's crying to be heard. 

Where I was going; however, stood out from these booths. Stood out in the way that it blended in: there wasn’t a curtain to identify it; there wasn’t much of a door either. The flight attendant slid a card down a thin seam that, if you were looking for it, could be seen running from floor to ceiling. Grabbing onto the outer ridge and moving it leftwards, the wall folded in on itself, squeezing against the wall like a collapsable fan. She moved out of the way and presented the room with a show of her hand: a sweet lavender smell rushed out of the doorway, trying desperately to fill the first class’s, scentless vacuum. I slowly pressed in, careful not to disturb the sanctuary's atmosphere.

“Make yourself comfortable, it’s all yours.” She slid the door closed behind me and the room worked to replenish its aroma. 

Contrary to the minimalist aluminum that sheathed the plane inside and out, the interior of this room was wooden. Slat panels with acoustic foam underneath: the only light coming from red strips where the plane's cylindrical body requires the wall to slope inwards. The reminder that I was, in fact, on a plane, caused my stomach to sink; an unexpected blow after a period of tranquility. My momentary comfort only ensured the impact hurt worse when I fell from my pedestal. The room fought to draw me back in: it whispered classical music into my ears from an unseen source. 

In the center of the room was a round, solo dining table; stained dark and well polished: a napkin folded into the shape of a bird sat as the centerpiece. The accompanying seat looked to be a massage chair: leg nooks, a cubic brutalist body, and wrapped in maroon leather. Most of the wall behind it was dedicated to a water feature; one that had a thin waterfall that ran down a pane of tempered glass. Flowing down into a trough where large, flowered, lily pads jiggled around on top of the water, and red LEDs shown from below. 

I sunk into the chair, engulfed in its fluff, and surrounded by rubber pistons. Embedded into the armrest was a control panel, far more settings than on a mall chair; and luckily the absence of a cash slot. The buttons were not easy to discern however; all were different glowing colors, with white, seemingly random symbols on their faces. As I went through clicking the buttons, some connection could be gleaned between their symbol and function. The horizontal zigzag activated the massager, the turtle and rabbit buttons controlled speed, three wavy vertical lines were the heater, and the exclamation mark was to call in a flight attendant. I only realized the last one when a lady walked in, as I was whincing at the chair's, borderline painful massage feature. 

""Is the room to your liking?"" she asked. 

""Oh definitely, it's very nice. This is all very unexpected. I feel kinda outta place. Don’t get me wrong I appreciate it—it’s just, yeah, unexpected”

“You aren’t out of place at all, it was reserved for you."" She said with a consistent cadence, happy, but not enthusiastic; and a thin smile that wasn’t overbearingly consumer friendly, but definitely choreographed. She spoke very hushed, and matter-of-factly. 

""How's that? I bought the cheapest ticket I could."" 

""Well, it was selected at 'random'."" She said while using airquotes. 

""What does ‘random’ mean?"" 

""It’s determined by a computer, so as ‘random’ as they can be. There's still code and statistics involved, it’s not drawing sticks, but it does help us find you.” 

“Is there a reason for this?"" 

“The room or the ritual?” She asked with a lifted brow.

“The what now? A ritual?”

“I probably shouldn’t have called it that, the company likes to call it a ‘transaction’.” She said using air quotes again.

“Well what is the transaction!” My tone rising and becoming desperate.

“It’s just something that has to be done.” She said putting her hands up and backing up a couple of steps. ""A company policy, for safety reasons I think. I don’t know specifics, the captain usually gives the rundown by now; he can explain it better than me.” Stepping back further.

“You have to tell me more, you can’t say that then leave.”

“I-I’ll see if I can get the captain. Hang tight for a second.” She said with an increasingly shaky voice, before quickly spinning around, her Farrah Fawcett hair flinging over her shoulder as she dashed to the door. The sound of the door closing was followed by multiple and simultaneous locks moving into place.

I paced around the room waiting for the man to come: my mind was running through a rolodex of possible rituals. If she even meant it in the ghoulish, sacrifice a virgin way, she could’ve meant a tradition. I really needed a release, it felt like I was going to choke on my anxiety, so I figured it was as good a time as any to pick a drink off the wall. Across from the table was a shelved wall stocked with a large selection of alcohol. All were in ornate decanters, the names of the contents etched into a gold plaque in front of them. It's not much of an exaggeration to say the collection contained every intoxicating beverage. There were many high end liquors, easily worth..I don’t even know how much; then a few were filled with cheap, working man's beer.

As I poured myself a drink, three gentle knocks came from the door. After giving them the okay to come in, the captain slid open the door; gave me a chipper hello, and held out his hand to shake mine. I did not reciprocate. He had thick grey hair, from the looks of his mustache and curly mullet that poofed out from his tall, sturdy hat.

""What do you think about the room?"" He asked with a rancher’s twang in a slightly raspy voice.

“I want to know why I’m in here.”

“I apologize for this, transaction, being revealed to you in that way. Rosie is..well, she’s a bit ditsy I suppose. Lose her head if it weren’t screwed to her body kinda girl. I think it goes over better coming from my buttery smooth voice.” He said with a chuckle. 

“Can you cut to it, this is maddening.”

“Yes you’re right, enough beaten around the horse.” He sighed and rolled his eyes before locking them back to mine. Their blue color fading into a grey as well. “Look, every flight we are obligated to do this. It ain’t pretty, but the consequences are far worse. Okay?” Looking at me with those wide, piercing eyes.

“Yes?”

“Somebody, on every flight, in this case you, has to eat a baby. Alright?”

“No, not alright. What are you talking about?”

“Listen, I know how you feel; I was in your spot once; so has my co-pilot, and most of the flight attendants. A whole hell of a lot of folks have been in your shoes. None of us liked it. Well most of us didn’t like it, but that’s just how it is.”

“You’re full of shit. This can’t be true”

“Nuh uh, this is definitely real. This is how it’ll go, when you agree to our terms, the chef will…”

“I’m not listening to this, I’m shutting you down, la la la la” He grabbed my side, right under my ribs and squeezed tight. I whimpered and grabbed his hand to try to push it away but his grip was deadlocked. 

“Now would you cut that out, what I’m trying to tell you is important. I can’t stress enough how crucial this duty is. Are you willing to be civilized if I let you go?”

“Yes..” I said between blowing spastic breaths through my reddening cheeks.

“When you agree, the chef will come in, prepare the meal, and you will eat the whole thing, all before we land.”

“What happens if I don't?”

""The landing gear will malfunction, it’ll only partially deploy. When we touch down we will tip, port side, the left wing will touch ground, and break off bit by bit until it reaches the engine. An explosion will ensue that’ll set the blades free; where they will rip into the cabin, slaughtering everyone in its path. We will lose all footing and the nose will plunge into the ground. First class will crumple instantly; the body will be split at the midsection; the rear will flip over seven times until it collapses. There will be only one survivor. You.""

""That’s..not true."" I had nothing else to say, I could barely get those words out as the scenario played out in front of my eyes. Like a film scrolling across them, a reel of a thousand frames, displaying the most vile scene. The horrifying sight, a stark reality, but brought on by a barbaric fable. Just a masochist’s tale.

""The chef will be in to prepare dinner shortly."" he said, patting the table and hoisting himself up, a series of brittle pops came from his knee. He brushed off his pant leg and strode out lankily through that deceptive door. I envied that freedom. The room never felt so small, and it was only becoming more cramped. 

I could still see the door’s seam, just as hidden as when I first came in, but now the ridges didn’t give as I tugged. Maybe it wasn’t there, I moved from groove to groove, pulling on each one. I scaled the wall like a mad man, pulling in places I knew it couldn’t be, but had no choice but to try anyway. I pounded on the door, throwing my body against it a few times until I bruised. I screamed, calling for someone who could not hear me, or would not care. The world outside the door was silent, as I was to them, for that time I didn’t exist and neither did they. That is a horrid and insoluble isolation. When my over exertion gave way to lightheadedness I involuntarily slide down the wall. Through blurry eyes and a swiveling head I tried to ground myself, but the fog only grew. I felt feverish, as if my eyes could water and sink into my burning face. Then came an unnatural drowsiness; like my weighted blanket made its way up to my face and was smothering me. Naturally the darkness gave way to sleep.

I regained consciousness all at once, a prick in the inner pit of my elbow sending a zap of urgency into my heart. A bulbous nose and a dark, thick, mustache filled my frame of vision. When he put some space between us, I could see those features belonged to a robust man in a chefs attire, holding a syringe. 

Trying to squirm only amounted to the realization that I had been bound to the chair. My hands were duct taped in one large, bulbous mass, my exposed fingers stuck to a knife in my left, and a fork in my right. 

The man walked over to the kitchenette; flicking keys around a ring, sifting through a hoard of them to find the few he needed. One buy one he unlocked units of the kitchen that I couldn’t get into. The hanging cupboard and minifridge on either side a tiered display of spices between them. The man put on an apron, a white fluffy hat; then turned to me. A wide smile on his face, silicon molded dimples on full display: brightly lit by his ivory veneers, one of which had disappeared, the tiny shaved remnants of his true tooth on full display. And his eyes squinted shut; likely the result of botox losing its potency; his puffy dark eyelids left sitting awkwardly on smooth, pearshaped cheeks. 

""What'll it be?"" he said. ""Soup or Salad?"" in a very heavy, coarse accent. 

""Go fuck yourself."" I said before thrashing around to no avail. My biceps were taped against my chest, a zip tie joining my arms at the elbow: and my legs were clamped tight in their massaging nooks. 

""no no. Not a option. Soup or Salad."" 

""I’m not eating anything. I don’t know what sick game you are playing, but I’m not a part of it."" 

“But you see, this is no game. It’s ah..a requirement, you can understand that.""

“No I cannot. I don’t understand how someone can eat a child.”

""You are not eating the baby yet. Just appetizers to start."" 

""Like I said, I’m not eating."" 

""The soup is a very fresh Gnocchi, with ingredients straight from the homeland. Or the crisp caprese salad, also grown from the fertile fields of home.” 

“Where are you from?”

“Across the sea.”

“That applies to everyone.”

“Me most of all.”

I figured it was not worth acknowledging him; that paying attention to him would become maddening: like realizing a gnat is buzzing around your ear and no longer able to ignore it.

 ""I know what you want, the salad, yes?""...""Excellent choice!"" 

He opened a metal compartment which released a mist that snuck out around the edges. Chilled ingredients were sorted on the compact shelves. With expert speed he chopped and tossed the salad, placing it on the table with an extended arm, before folding it behind his back and finishing with a bow.

""Say when."" he said, grating a block of cheese into the bowl. Whether it came from the man, cheese or salad I couldn’t decide, but a pungent smell hit me all at once. Even when the block of cheese was shredded in its entirety into my salad I didn't say a word.

 ""Oh my friend, I hope you chew thoroughly. This may be no bueno on its way out."" he said with a deep laugh, and returned to his station. After dropping the grater and some other dishes in the sink he clapped his hands together and said his goodbyes. 

""Au revoir mon ami, I do hope you enjoy. I’ll begin dinner when you're ready."" 

""I'm telling you now, I’m not gonna be ready."" 

""Ah, I have a hunch that you will be."" 

The next 20 minutes crawled by. Thrashing around in my seat had no noticeable effect on my restraints. Despite my forearms having some mobility, my range of motion only allowed my to move my useless hands to my face. The sharp golden utinzels in my hand were just a bait, telling I could cut myself loose. In reality all I could do was bring them straight up to my face; which did provide an out if it came to that. 

""It looks like you haven't touched your salad. Is it no good?"" He said when he returned.

""I told you I wasn't eating it."" 

""Then you must be saving your appetite for the main course, yes?"" 

""No."" 

""I will prepare the meal anyway. The smell of food always brings out hunger."" 

Opening the mysterious remaining cabinet beside the spice rack, with two gentle hands the chef reached in for something. From out of it he pulled a little mass of cloth, pulling it into the crease of his arms and readjusting its weight. He turned around and in a very soft tone he said. 

""Do you have any allergies?"" 

In his arms was a: plump, blond, sleeping baby, swaddled in a blanket. 

""Oh my god.. It's real.. It's really happening"" I said under my breath.

""I pride myself on never having allergized one of my guests, I want that to continue."" 

I can only imagine I was stark white, with bulging eyes and a slacked jaw, that’s how I felt anyway. An anxiety welling up inside me, far more deep and poignant than what had plagued me hours ago. Those feelings seemed so trivial now. What I would give to be a cowering, small man, in my economy seat again. 

""No allergies? Excellent, the preparations can begin."" 

He plugged the sink and began filling it with water. 

“How can you do this? This is sick, all of this.”

“Somebody has to do it. I have to prepare the meal. You have to eat it. Like it or not, it must be done.”

""I won’t eat it. You'll be killing him for nothing."" 

""Her, actually. That's all that we know. She has no name. No family. No identification. Seven people knows she exists. Nobody will know she's gone."" 

I began to cry. My head falling as far as my restraints would allow, and I sobbed with choking gasps. 

""you can't...you can't do it.."" 

He turned off the sink and looked at me with a viscous scowl, the first time he's dropped the chipper persona. 

""You are unreasonable."" 

He placed the baby back in the cupboard, slapped its door shut and stormed out of the room. I continued to weep even though a slight relief developed, thinking I got out of it. The pressure put on me, and the evil this room has concealed, still crushing me. It felt tainted, a sour putrid air, under the veil of lavender vapor. The smell, I thought was just a placebo, my mind molding the room into my narrative, but something was definitely seeping into the room. 

At first it made my mouth feel foamy; like it was drying out, and a mucky film remained. Then it was arid; a bitter taste like a dentist's numbing paste, laid on top of my sandpaper tongue. The draught moved down my throat, sucking air out with it: it wasn't long before a hiccup like gasp flared up under my sternum. I choked and I coughed, a series of convulsions working to bring something up from inside of me. I started to vomit, spewing from my nose at the first release, the stinging was horrid and the sight was repulsive. The bile seeping in between my clamped thighs. While the vomiting was unpleasant, the dry heaving was torturous. My empty stomach had no more to give; but the gagging carried on. 

At some point the classical music died out, whether it was before my gagging fit or during, I didn’t notice; but when musical ambiance was reintroduced into the room, it was impossible to ignore. Heavy metal, at a headache inducing volume, snapped into the room full bore. I don’t remember what was played in between, but the torture begun with Slayer and ended with Disturbed

Gallons of sweat poured out of me; soaking me in my DIY leather bound sauna. My man-made lubrication proved ineffective in my attempt to slip free: although my efforts had become lackluster; only energy left to swing my head around. I never passed out, that would’ve been a blessing. I danced so close to the land between heat exhaustion, and suffocation: always to be pulled back, into a state of gas induced bulimia. Eventually the gasping did end, far beyond the last point I could’ve been grateful. My whole body was dry, wrung out and depleted of moisture: my sweat soaked body had evaporated, leaving behind a meat scent on my crunchy clothes. 

I barely noticed that someone had entered the room, until my head was pushed into the leather headrest. My crusty, bloodshot eyes fought to see through the grain and piercing light. An unexpected stream of liquid hit them in the pupil and finally caught their attention. Prying hands pulled open my mouth and shot the stream down my throat, no stopping when it grazed my uvulae. I blinked my eyes clear, and hacked water at the hands until they left my mouth. Finally able to see two flight attendants, wearing thin plastic ponchos, over their tightly pressed uniforms. 

""Have you decided to do it yet?"" One asked; a squirt bottle in hand. 

Still drippling and spitting up the excess water I hacked a glob at his shoes, hitting it right in the toe. He clenched his teeth, then his hands, and busted me in the cheek. 

""Mike! We aren't supposed to do that. You'll bruise your knuckles"". The female attendant said, placing a concerned hand on his crinkly shoulder. 

""Let's just get this over with.” He said, while pulling up his ankle and furiously taking a handkerchief to his shoe.

The lady walked to a metal cart they had wheeled in: a dinky thing with four slender legs, and two shelves holding only a few items. She carefully slipped on two oversized leather gloves, flapping the loose fingers around like an old cathers mit. She scrunched the fingers around the tiny handle on an aluminum tray. Steam poured out around the edge of the lid as she opened it: some wrapping around her forearm, urging her to yank away; murmuring obscenities under her breath. 

With long tongs, she reached into the tray and pulled out a folded blue towel, giving it a little shake, before making her strut back to me. 

""This is your last opportunity. We land in two hours. It'll take most of that time for dinner to be prepared and served. We hope you realize what's at stake here."" The lady said. 

""We’re sure you are a rational man. You can do the math, this is one life to ensure the safety of 90."" The man added 

""If ‘morality’ is the cause of your hangup, you must find it immoral to let 90 innocent passengers die"". Said she, it becoming clear at this point they intended to alternate dialogue.

""Deaths that you are aware will occur, as a product of your inaction."" 

""You will not be able to plead ignorance in the life that follows. The blood will stain your hands alone."" 

My breathing had become choppy, not as much from physical torture, but of that going on in my head. Proof that my tear ducts were once again operational, tears fell down my face, mixing into the open wound on my left cheek, and down the blood stream that collected under my chin. 

""I can't do it."" I said between sobs 

""Damn."" The woman said before grabbing my mess of hair and yanking my head back. The red ceiling lights became eclipsed by the blue towel hovering over my face. The tongs released and it slapped onto my face. The sequence of events moved so quickly it took a second for the pain to fully manifest. The heat grew from warm,to unpleasant, to searing. I tried to shake it off but the hand left my hair and grabbed the ends of the towels, snagging it tight around my face. The suffocation went unnoticed while the 2nd degree burn was fresh.

An immediate cooling soothed my face briefly; cold water washing over the burns. The sensation of bliss lasted a moment before the water found my airways. The towel was ripped away, dribblets of water and flesh trailing in the air after it. Intense pain rippled across my face with every hack and cough, trying to clear water from my throat. Bubbling masses coming into view around the edges of my eyes: blisters rising without hesitation. 

""This can end whenever you want!"" The woman said, holding the towel near her chest. 

I had no reserved air to respond with, all I could do was shake my head. Though the torture was unbareable, it was what I deserved. If I would be the only one to crawl through this plane's debris, over the bodies of people I could've saved, I was willing to pay for it. 

The torment went on like that for, god knows how long. The world was reduced to sensations; as if my mind only extended as far as my body. I knew more was out there, but in my restraints, and subdued by my torturers, I was the only person in a tight void. The only relevance time had to me was the hope that I could run out their clock. 

They eventually removed the towel for the last time, and put themselves back together, to resume their facade for the passengers. It didn't matter much anymore, how the passengers saw them, or if they even carried on with their job. There wasn't enough time for dinner. Our fate was sealed. 

I was in paralysis for the remainder of the trip. We hit patches of turbulence periodically, any disturbance felt as if it could’ve been the last. None of it startled me, the extent of my acknowledgement was feeling my head bob and sway around. I experienced something I rarely ever did: complete complacency. 

No smooth words, great performance, bribe, promise, or wish, would change what was coming. A terrible thing, but it was inevitable now. It was just me, and a short stretch of time before the course of my life would be split in two. It was absolute clarity without the peace. Moreso a desperate acceptance; the terms were very grim, but I made a choice. 

I likely could've escaped in that time. My restraints had become waterlogged and lost much of their grip. With enough thrashing they could've come undone; but where to go after that? That is the horror of an aircraft, the hopelessness that comes when you board. People have no clue where the real horror lies. People have no clue about the room nestled near the cockpit, where a dinner is forced on a passenger every flight. 

A buttery smooth voice entered the room like spoiled milk. The pilot's voice came over the entercom. 

""Ladies and Gentlemen, we are beginning to make our descent. The local time is 3:19, and the sky is clear. We want to thank you for flying with us today, and wish you safe travels ahead."" 

Then a flight attendant entered the room. Clacking her heels towards me before placing a hand on my shoulder and shoving my back into the seat. My eyes met hers, and she spoke through gritted teeth. 

""I hope you're happy. Mr. Lucky. Make sure to live it up, for us."" 

She reached over me, to grab a bottle of liquor. She pulled out a scattering of loose pills, and scarfed them all down. Flicking the decanters plug off with her thumb she took a big swig, some trickling out the sides of her mouth. Wiping her face clean she walked to the far wall, pressing her back to it and sliding down to the floor. 

""The Captain said I could if I stayed in here. I want to be out cold before we land."" 

Other flight attendants entered, also pouring themselves drinks and lying on the floor as we made our way closer to the ground. They berated me for what I did to them: cursed my name, put hex’s on my bloodline. I only felt pity for them. If this was how they wanted to spend their final moments, I would allow it. I thought it was a true display of their character, to end their lives like that. Letting their cruelness seep out. The finality of the death bed, does have a way of revealing truths. The most raw look at someone's life, and how it consistently ends. I wanted to die with my morality intact: I lost that the moment I booked this flight. 

Our ears began popping and we knew we were getting close. The pill popper had already faded away, others were severely wasted, and sobbing came from the ones who only managed a buzz. The wheels touched the ground hard. An anticipated feeling, but was impossible to prepare for. Multiple bounces up and down as the tires made contact, only to lose its footing right after. It rattled my empty stomach; its deep, hollow ache returning after a long absence. The tilting took longer than expected, it could’ve been happening without our knowledge. But the anticipation only grew, the dread becoming unbearable, for an event everyone assumed to be instant. The plane sturdied itself, and the force pressing on our bodies lightened. We were slowing down. Not the violent slowing of the wing scrapping tar, it was completely mechanical. Even as the plane drove around the landing strips, slowly taking corners, we couldn't be certain the accident was avoided. If fate was at play, an unexpected and contrived sequence of events could take place any moment. But the plane docked. The captain came into the room, summoning the attendants to assist the passengers as they exited. 

""It didn't happen."" one of the attendants said with a flabbergasted expression, ""This has never happened."" 

""My god."" another said, ""Was it a lie? Did I do it for nothing!"" She clutched her face and began to sob. 

The pilot quickly shooed the in-tact attendants out of the room, shutting the door behind them. He stepped over the sobber who had sprawled herself across the floor, with her face pressed against the wood: her muffled sobs trickled out between the cracks, as did her tears. Taking a tiny pair of scissors out of his pocket he started to cut at the duct tape. 

""This will take a while. I can't bring anything larger on board. You know how strict the rules are."" 

""We didn't crash. You were lying."" I said

""I was not. This is unexpected. Incredibly rare."" 

""That's bullshit. Why would this flight be the one that's spared?"" 

""It's not our place to know, or ask. This is a blessing, count it as one. And tread lightly, charity comes at a cost to someone."" 

He finished cutting at my bonds, I stretched and squeezed my hands to regain the feeling that I had done so long without. They shook as I, numb and feebly pulled at the dangling tape. It was a laborious task that I knew going into it I wouldn't finish. I stood up with strips still clung to me; bunching up the back of my jacket, and tucked into my pants. I was covered in the residual stickiness, the blotchy film that remains, even after paint has been torn from the walls. My smell was atrocious too, layers of sweat and B.O. with a bile finish. It would soon be masked though.

The pilot came in with a half filled coffee pot. From an arms length away he stopped walking and flung it my way. The coffee sloshed out, and engulfed my face. As it wrapped around my head I braced for the scorching to set in, but it was only mild. No more pain than if anything touched my already peeled, and blistered face. As it settled in, it proved to be incredibly thick and dark; like laundry detergent stained black. 

""It's been on the burner for a very long time. We call it diesel, thick as oil and will have you running all night."" He said. 

""What's your fucking problem?"" I asked as I shook beads of the slop off my hands, and fanned out my soaked shirt. 

""When you get off the plane, head to the medical station and tell them about your accident. Then call our company, file a complaint and show them your face. They will apologize, promise to brew the coffee colder, and pay you off."" 

""People have to know what happened here. They'll stop flying if they do."" 

""You know people won't stop flying. This tech is a miracle. Even with the baggage that comes with it."" 

Two flight attendants returned, having escorted everyone else off the plane. 

""Would you two carry her to the medics?” Nudging the unconscious woman with his foot. “Bring our volunteer with you while you're at it."" The pilot said, placing a firm hand on my damp shoulder. I swatted it off and gathered up my things as the attendants held the woman in the air, one at her feet, the other under her shoulders. Her hands dragged the entire way, we stopped a few times to cross them over her body but they always fell again. 

I sat in the medics station for a while, all it amounted to was giving me a change of clothes, and ice for my face. They said I would have to be transferred to a nearby hospital for real treatment. As I waited for the squad to arrive, I used the time to reach out to my family. I knew my mom would be antsy to know how the flight went, but more urgently I had to tell them what hospital I was going to. When I turned my phone off of airplane mode I received a wall of notifications, with numerous missed calls, and texts from my family. I called my mom back, ringing multiple times, before a soft, quiet, hello picked up. 

""Hey Mom, what's going on?"" 

""Did you just land?"" she asked. 

""Yeah a little bit ago, I'm still at the airport. Is everything alright?"" 

""Your Dad started getting really bad a couple hours ago. His throat is very swollen with an infection, and it could lead to pneumonia. They put him on a ventilator, and we’re waiting for the swelling to go down so they can remove some of the fluid. If he goes in for surgery, it’ll be very risky, and they want us to see him, in case, it doesn’t go well.""

1phmv5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1phmv5e/what_could_explain_her_shift_from_warmth_to/,What could explain her shift from warmth to discomfort and then blocking me?,"I met a 28-year-old girl while I was temporarily in her city. She knew I wasn’t staying long. I asked her out, and the date was amazing she was funny, caring, sweet. When my drink was empty, she shared hers; when I finished my food quickly, she shared that too. She’s really beautiful, and honestly I had an erection while we were sitting in the restaurant. 

I invited her on a second date at my place and said I’d cook dinner. She agreed, but with the condition that it would only be dinner I said okay. We cooked together, laughed a lot, she helped with the dishes, it was really cute. Then we sat down to watch a movie. I didn’t touch her and she didn’t touch me, but there was tension. At some point we kissed. Before that I asked her if she was sure, and told her we’d stop anytime if she didn’t want to. She said we could keep going. She also told me she’d only had sex once, last year, and that she was scared of the pain.

I tried to go really slowly, but it was hard to enter, and we had to stop several times. I comforted her, she kept apologizing, saying she was nervous and couldn’t relax. In the end we had sex about three times during the night, but honestly I wanted more, though it was painful for her. Afterward we cuddled, slept hugging, she kissed my cheek and ran her fingers through my hair. In the morning I was turned on again, and when she woke up I started touching her and tried to get her aroused, but it was even more painful for her. She tried to give me a handjob but I told her I can’t finish from that, only from sex or a blowjob. She refused both and I asked for anal and she refused that too. Then I asked if I could finish on her chest and she agreed.

After that we showered separately. I offered breakfast, a walk, coffee to-go, and to walk her to the metro. She suddenly shut down nothing was left of the fun, warm girl from the day before. She answered with one word at a time. I brought up the previous night and told her she didn’t owe me anything, that a kiss doesn’t mean she’s obligated to have sex, and that her “no” is enough to stop, she never has to tolerate pain. She said it was great I said that not many guys know it. She also said she was brave for coming to my place, that it’s a risk for women. I said I felt her tense up inside during penetration. She said she was nervous because it was only her second time ever, the last time was a year ago, and she never goes to a stranger’s home like that. There was some regret in her voice.

I asked if she was glad she had sex. She said: I don’t know, I didn’t understand, I was in pain most of the time. Then we walked for coffee in silence, it was awkward, she didn’t initiate conversation and stayed closed off. Then she asked something about my job and we talked a bit. I walked her to the metro and we kissed goodbye.

The next day I texted her. I had just passed an exam and told her. She congratulated me and asked if I was celebrating. I said no. I asked how she was doing, she said she had a lot of work. Then I told her if she wanted a quick schmus she could come over and that I was very chill today and she blocked me.

I don’t understand what went wrong. Why the drama if she came to my place herself, knew what she was doing, and what’s the problem with coming over again and just having fun? She knew I was leaving soon and that my career was starting. She consciously went into this so what’s the issue?",1,1765224657.0,AskMenAdvice,16,0.57,False

1phmtqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1phmtqn/my_hakone_ryokan_recommendations/,My Hakone ryokan recommendations,"Hello! I did a lot of research on Hakone accommodations for the two trips to Japan this year, including posting and searching on this subreddit, so wanted to share my experience!

We visited Hakone twice this year, once in early April and once at the end of November. We stayed at Hakone Ginyu and Toki no Yu Setsugetsuka respectively.

Our first stay was in April 2025 for our honeymoon and we had a larger budget as a result. We chose to stay at Hakone Ginyu for two nights, with dinner and breakfast included. This hotel stay cost around $800 USD/ night or 236,000 yen total, and we stayed in the Tsuki- Meigetsu (Japanese style) room. 
We really enjoyed our stay here. The room itself was beautiful and it was our first time staying in a Japanese style hotel with the tatami floors and futon beds, which were very comfortable. The room was large and the outdoor patio and private onsen was incredible. The onsen had a lovely private garden view and we used the bath several times a day throughout our two night stay. The room had a mini fridge with several free drink options, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Kaisekj dinners. We had requested to do the teppanyaki option one night, but unfortunately their teppanyaki person was injured and unable to do the meal. They were able to accommodate my pescatarian diet and still served my partner the meat options which worked out great. She did not enjoy the Kaiseki meal as much, especially the second night, but I think she was a little over all the fish by that time. Dinner is coursed and served in the room, and took several hours to complete.
Breakfast is also served in the room and there is an option for traditional and western breakfast. I chose traditional both days, and my partner chose western- we both enjoyed our meals.
The service at this hotel was very good and felt personalized, and they even surprised us with a little experience after dinner for our honeymoon.
The location of this hotel is slightly out of the main area of town but is located near a cable car stop so you can get around town easily. There are beautiful views of the trees/mountain side from the hotel lobby and bar. 
We did not use the public onsen because our private one was so nice, but they are available as well.
We felt this hotel was a really nice experience for our honeymoon but likely too expensive to visit again anytime soon. 

We loved Hakone (and Japan in general) so much that we decided to come back again for the fall season.
At the end of November we stayed at Toki no Yu Setsugetsuka for one night.
We booked more last minute for this stay and the only option for this hotel was the western style room, and we decided to forgo the included meals this time. For our one night stay, we paid $250 USD or 39,000 yen. 
The bed was comfortable and the room had enough space for us and our luggage. We enjoyed coffee on the patio in the morning with a view of the trees.
At this hotel, all rooms include a private hinoki bath on the terrace (not onsen water), and the property offers two different public onsens as well as a few private onsens that are first-come, first-served. The hotel provides pajamas, yukata, slippers, a wicker basket, etc for visiting the onsen and wandering around the hotel. We were lucky to find an open private onsen to enjoy at night, and then visited the main onsen the next morning. I really enjoyed the main onsen- it was very spacious, had multiple little baths of various temperatures, a sauna, and a very picturesque outdoor bath that was surrounded by trees and other vegetation. The onsen was clean and well-maintained, with plenty of space for everyone. The hotel provides lots of little snacks for free, which is always appreciated. At night there were popsicles, in the morning probiotic yogurt drinks, and late night snack of ramen. We did not choose the breakfast or dinner options for the hotel, but due to to excellent location in Gora we found a great restaurant within walking distance for dinner that we enjoyed. 
The service here was also great and the location is the best part, it was so easy to access the Hakone loop, multiple transportation options, and shopping and restaurants right next door.
The hotel also has a great gift shop that had both souvenirs and food/drink options.
This hotel offered excellent value in a town known for more expensive ryokans, and we would absolutely stay here again.

Just wanted to leave a little review of the two ryokans we visited for anyone looking for a good option at two very different price points!

Sorry for the long post but I’m genuinely feeling like I’m losing my mind and need some outside perspectives - a few details have been changed for anonymity. 

This weekend I (F31) travelled to see my favorite sports team play in their home arena. I travel solo often and have had many great experiences, but I know the risks and consider myself good at being on alert and aware of my surroundings.
For this sports team, I have a small podcast with my cohost Cole (M37) who lives in the home state. After attending the game on Friday we decided to do the podcast back at the hotel I’m staying at. They had a couple chill areas for us to set up, and we met some cool people and other fans while doing it. One guy, Brent (M mid/late 40s) came to talk to us after. He was nice, but he made some comments about whether or not we were a couple and while it was nothing concerning, I definitely took note of it. 

When it was time for Cole to go home, I walked him out to his uber then walked to my hotel room. Now my room was on the first floor right across from the elevators - something I wish I had realized earlier as since I travel alone often I ask for “safer” room options such as on higher floors and away from exits. So that was kind of on me. Anyways, I said bye to Brent and some other people at the elevator and went to my room. 

That night I got an Instagram message (my Instagram is on our podcast page for engagement) from Brent - he acknowledged he was a little forward but was wondering if he could take me for coffee in the morning. There’s nothing wrong with this, it’s fine to ask people out, I actually appreciate this more as someone living through the dating app years lol. 
But I wasn’t interested, I already had slightly uncomfortable vibes. I responded saying that was very kind of him to ask but I will be extremely busy in my short time here and won’t have the time. Basically - I gave him the benefit of the doubt and tried to remain polite despite my intuition.
He responded kindly at first seeming to understand, but then sent messages along the lines of “well if you change your mind I’ll be here all night…” and some emojis like the facepalm. 

I didn’t respond and carried on with my weekend. Saturday there was another game, and Brent messaged both Cole and I in a group chat asking if we’d like to share an uber. I hadn’t filled Cole in on anything at that point but took initiative to thank Brent for his offer but we wouldn’t be interested.
When Cole and I went to the game, I filled him in on how I was feeling about Brent, and he seemed to understand.
After the game, we went back to the hotel for the podcast and were joined by our friend Matt (M35). 
As Cole was getting everything set up for the podcast I ordered us drinks at the bar. The bartender handed them to me and told me they were paid for by Brent. I didn’t even see Brent anywhere, in a very non busy setting. I just thanked the bartender and went to do the podcast. But I did ask Matt if he could stay with me that night as I was beginning to feel a little unnerved. Matt agreed. 
After the show was finished, Brent immediately came to join Cole, Matt, and I in the lobby and some other guests joined too. 
Brent brought me a souvenir from the game, and started making some comments that were making me uncomfortable. Asking why I was still single, calling me beautiful every 3 seconds, telling me I’m amazing and smart, etc. He would only say these things when Cole and Matt weren’t in the convo. 
Cole was behind me talking to others so I elbowed him to get him to turn around and join our conversation. The comments stopped. 

Cole, Matt, and I went outside to walk Cole to his car and I mentioned feeling uncomfortable with Brent. I truly thought they understood. We were out there for about 15 minutes, and as Matt and I walked back inside I semi-jokingly said “watch Brent be waiting for me at my hotel room.” But guys…he WAS. As we were walking we saw Brent come out from around the corner where my room is located and walk past us. Matt acknowledged him saying “hey man” but Brent kept walking silently.

This really shook me up. What would’ve happened if Matt wasn’t with me? I started to even doubt myself, justifying it as “oh well I don’t know for SURE that he was at my hotel room, he was just in the area.” 
But a few minutes later I got another message from Brent on Instagram, admitting that he was WAITING OUTSIDE MY ROOM to “ask me some questions” and saw me with Matt and chickened out. This made my stomach drop. I couldn’t sleep. I was physically shaking, and Matt seemed to try to downplay it - like “oh well the room is locked now so it’s okay.” In that moment I also felt guilty because I was in no mood to hang out with Matt like everything was fine. I couldn’t think about anything else. 
Matt ended up falling asleep and I stayed awake the whole night waiting for Brent to come bust down the room door or something. 

In the morning, Matt left almost immediately. Like I had done something wrong. So now I felt unsafe and even more guilty. I read the rest of Brent’s message and blocked him on Instagram. The message was basically him saying he’s a helpless romantic who says stupid things but he really wants to know if I’m single or not and if he can take me out blah blah blah. 

After Matt left, around check out time there was knocking on my door. I knew it was Brent. I didn’t look through the peephole, I just stayed silent. I called the front desk and asked if I could check out an hour later. The knocking eventually stopped, and I checked out and got to the airport safely. 

Here’s where I’m starting to doubt everything - Cole and Matt both don’t seem to understand why I was as scared as I was. Even I barely understand it as usually I hold myself together well. This morning, Cole sent me a screenshot of message from Brent saying he feels horrible and it wasn’t his intention to make me feel uncomfortable. I told Cole how I cried when I got home that I was so shaken up - and Cole’s response was basically “I think he’s just a weird awkward guy who doesn’t know how to talk to women, and I don’t see any maliciousness or danger from him.” 
And Matt hasn’t talked to me. 

Now I feel embarrassed like I blew it up into this huge thing and am worried Cole and Matt see me in a different way now, like an attention seeker. 

So am I overreacting?? Should I have just played it off as some awkward guy?? 
I do blame myself for not being as direct with a rejection, but I also didn’t want to make anyone angry. Thank you for any perspectives",0,1765224188.0,TwoHotTakes,3,0.5,False

*Even now, a hundred years after the events, we still can’t find definitive proof whether there was a secret war during the time of the Independence War, or if it was just pure and plain conspiracy theories.*

**Description next to a sniper rifle in the Independence War Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark, 106 B.I.**

 

The mind-numbing reports never stopped coming; Karrn’s desk seemed to drown under them. He forced himself to read the next one — a letter from a law firm. They wanted to represent him and other Shraphen in something called a class action lawsuit against the Aligned Space Navy for the unlawful use of Unigel.

*Are they mental? He would be permanently crippled without Unigel.*

He thought back to a discussion he had with Rish, who told him healer Nesbitt was afraid something like this would happen.

He answered the letter with a simple remark. Hundreds of Shraphen would not be alive without Unigel, and Burrow would never be retaken without it. If this matter ended up in front of a judge, he himself would fly hundreds of witnesses to the courtroom to argue against the lawsuit.

Then he decided to send the letter and his remark to the embassy’s lawyers. He wanted to bill the law firm for the lost time he had endured even thinking about this matter.

*Lawyers — the same vultures no matter the planet.*

The next report — this one looked awfully official. He opened the digital file and saw he was correct. It was a confirmation of his ambassadorial status for Burrow.

So he wasn’t only responsible for the Shraphen from Taishon Tar but also for those from Burrow. He wasn’t surprised; Burrow saw Taishon Tar not as a separate, independent colony but only as an outpost.

This discussion would be funny. With any luck, he’d be dead when both governments decided to take care of the matter.

He flicked his ears. He could decline, citing that he wasn’t a citizen of Burrow and thus could not represent a foreign power.

As the humans say, that would cause shit to hit the fan. His ears leaned forward; he had always found that quote funny.

And fitting.

He decided he needed lawyers to handle this matter and forwarded this letter to them as well. And to the government on Taishon Tar — now that there was real-time communication. Let both sides figure it out right away. His butt was itchy enough from sitting in all the thorns—no need for him to sit in an anthill on top.

He had to think about Captain Gerber, who almost spat out his coffee when he heard about this particular Shraphen saying. They exchanged quotes for the rest of the day.

Thinking about his friend made Karrn even angrier about the piles of tablets heaped on his desk. What did he have a Shruf for?

“Shruf?” He didn't need to scream; he knew his Chief of Staff was always close by.

“Yes, Ambassador?” The short-built former head of Taishon Tar Intelligence entered the office only seconds after he had called him.

Karrn mustered him. Since they had left their home for Earth, their relationship had taken a turn for the better. On their journey, healer Nesbitt had discovered that Shruf had an illness called schizophrenia and had started treatment.

That changed Shruf from the ground up, but it was clear he could not fulfill his planned duties as an intelligence officer.

“Shruf, do I really need to read through all this nonsense?” Karrn held up a tablet. Reading the header, he exhaled. “This one’s for patent agreements between the Aligned Planets and Taishon Tar! Really?”

“Yes, Ambassador. You have to, unless you want to take the time to create a task force that represents our planet in the negotiations.”

“That takes forever! I thought all those agreements were made when we signed the Alliance contract back in the colony.”

Shruf grinned, his ears leaning forward in amusement. “No, Ambassador, the contract stated that such details would be negotiated later on, once embassies had been exchanged.”

Karrn knew when he was defeated. “The Governor must hate me.”

“No, the Governor said you’re the man for this job. Since you hate politics, you’ll do everything to deal with as little of them as possible.”

Karrn rubbed his temples. “Religious Pack — all the same with their philosophies.”

“Ambassador, I will write up recommendations for a task force for you if you like. I know you’re occupied with finding your missing friends.”

Karrn looked up, trying hard not to show any emotions. “What?”

Shruf just grinned. “I was Intelligence Pack — don’t forget that. Too bad you didn’t trust me enough to come to me, but I guess my prior behavior made that impossible.”

Then he left the office.

Karrn sat there thinking. Yes, he would never have come to Shruf, even though he was the embodiment of an efficient bureaucrat and the best chief of staff he could have wished for.

The communications terminal beeped, and a message came directly to his private account. A Message from IronBallz, the Glider wanted to meet.

The special way Gliders communicated prevented them from communicating anything other than writing, since they ‘spoke’ directly to an implant in other species' brains. That implant needed an actual intelligence to interpret the message.

Karrn remembered the long discussion he, IronBalls, and Healer Nesbitt had about how these circumstances hinted at hidden layers in the field of consciousness.

Karrn didn’t understand much back then, not that he did now.

Karrn answered; they could meet at his private residence outside the city after he met with Frox.

He decided to go for a walk in the park behind the embassy. On his way down, he watched the latest news on the newly founded Shraphen news feed. Oddly enough, he liked the show that intertwined a human news show with Shraphen-style factual reports.

The female Shraphen had a Terran dog in her lap; the picture was almost comical. “Now to the newest trend: more and more Shraphen are adopting Terran dogs into their households. Is it furry familiarity, or is it because there are too few tai on Earth? Find out more after the commercial.”

Karrn laughed. Not enough tai? Leave them alone in a forest for a season, and you’d have enough tai for every Shraphen on Earth.

But he began to wonder if humans also adopted tai. He remembered reading something about tai and how humans don’t get along well. Not hostile — just not full of love like humans and dogs had for each other.

As he entered the park, he enjoyed the chill in the air. The embassy was built close to the sea; the park ran along the shore so that he could smell the different odors of the sea, the park, and the city. It cleared his mind of the mystery that haunted him.

He remembered vividly the last night they were all together aboard the *Argos*.

—————

Karrn sat in the uncomfortable human chair. It was long past midnight, and not only did his tail hurt, but he was also exhausted; his species needed far more sleep than humans did.

The casual discussion in the admiral’s quarters was not easy to follow. He scratched his ear with his hind leg, which caused Dr. Nesbitt to pause her monologue about Batract biology.

The admiral used the pause. “Doctor, the results of your tests are fascinating, but how do you jump from cellular mobility and morphability to ‘escaped bioweapon’? Could it not just be a case of special evolution?”

Karrn yawned; he was thinking the same.

“No, not to that extent. Batract cells are capable of infecting almost any species I tested them with, except humans and Shraphen. And that’s odd, because they can infect dogs and tai—and virtually any other living matter. The fungus infects the cell and turns it into more Batract fungus.”

“Why not humans and Shraphen?” Captain Gerber asked. Karrn could smell the coffee the human drank to stay awake—maybe he should try it.

“Unknown. Well—somewhat unknown. The human immune system is quite aggressive compared to other species, and when exposed to Shraphen cells, the fungus dies. We have no clue why.”

The captain took another sip of his coffee and added, “Well, maybe we should find out and use it as a weapon.”

Karrn yawned again. For him, that sounded like an obvious solution—if only he could get comfortable on this damned chair.

“That would be unethical. They are sentient, and using any bioweapon against them…” The doctor was about to start when Lieutenant Davies interrupted.

“Doctor, if they are a weapon, they have to be treated like one. You don’t care about the feelings of a nuke, see?”

Karrn had had enough; the discussion was turning in circles, and he was tired. “So, that’s it. Admiral, Captain, I need to sleep. Good night.”

The others said goodbye, and he left the admiral’s quarters.

—————

*Had I known that this was the last time I’d see them, I would have stayed.*

Then he sniffed the air. He knew that smell; it was the reason his thoughts kept returning to his friends.

He remembered smelling it even in the embassy, only less intense—but now…

It came from the bench he knew would stand behind the tree group in front of him.

As he walked along the path, his body reacted before his consciousness did; his tail began wagging. Gerber and Davies, that’s their smell!

When he saw two people sitting on the bench, he knew it. The larger one stood up and walked toward him.

“Hello, old friend! I heard you’re looking for me?”

Karrn couldn’t believe it. On the one hand, he was happy seeing the captain; on the other… Gerber should be dead. Karrn said so.

“You should be dead!”

Gerber suddenly looked extremely sad. “Yes, I should. And were it not for Eleri, Jane, and I would be.”

“So I was right, the bodies…” Karrn began. He had known it. Why did humans play such stupid games?

“Clones. Quickly crafted to fool the people behind the attack on us.” Gerber softly grabbed Karrn’s shoulder.

“Karrn, you have to stop searching for us. There are people on Earth who want the Batract back. They tried to grab power once, and they will try again.”

Karrn thought about this. So it was true — the assassinations, the accidents. A secret war was being fought in the Sol system over humanity’s future.

“You could use my help.”

Now the female lieutenant answered. “No. The Shraphen and even the Gliders have to stay out of it. If you even seem to intervene, the other side can claim this is proof of alien interference.”

The lieutenant didn’t seem to have the usual naivety she had aboard *Argos*; she now seemed different — dangerous, even.

“I see. So, is it even safe for you to be here? And where is healer Nesbitt?”

Gerber looked around. “She’s monitoring the drones and security footage. And yes, it's not safe, but we created a blind spot here so we can talk. Karrn, again, stop looking.”

Karrn should be more surprised, but much of the information he learned was already known to him. It was just confirmation.

“I’m meeting IronBallz later at my home. Rosha and the pups aren’t home the whole week. You can explain everything there. I assume my home is safe enough?”

Gerber looked at Lieutenant Davies, who nodded after thinking for a second.

“Yes, it’s a secure location. Until 1800 hours, then.”

With those words, the two turned and walked away.

Only later did Karrn realize he had never told the two the time of the meeting; they had just known…

He turned and began his walk back to the embassy.

Gerber and Nesbitt are alive, thank the Great Hunter.

He had assumed—hoped even—but now he had proof.

While walking back, his ocular implant informed him of a secured call. Accepting the call, Shruf appeared, his ears laying back in stress. “Ambassador, we just got a call from Burrow. The 33rd Spaceborn has begun its invasion of the Northern Continent. Resistance is heavy.”

1phmloe,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1phmloe/grieving_the_emotional_immaturity_of_mil/,Grieving the emotional immaturity of MIL,"This pregnancy has shown a lot of who this individual is. There is a series of patterns and behaviors that unfortunately can no longer chalk it up as someone having a bad day. 

Examples:
• Went to OB for an emergency scan (first time mom, got worried, but everything is normal and fine) and texted her (temp lived with her) -- claims she never saw the text after I called her out on stating that she didn't seem to care. She apologized for not seeing it, hope everything is okay, but the next sentence out of her mouth ""Until I see something, I'm not emotionally attached, so while you are growing a child, I have no emotional attachment. It may be different with my daughter"". 

•We (hubby and I) temporarily lived with her due to moving in between an apartment to a home ... anything her dog did, or the freezer messing up, and small things that are not our fault was blamed on us. 

• Hubby left and came back with Starbucks, I sat at my work desk in the spare bedroom waiting for like .. 10 minutes while he sat in the garage. I went out there and said are you okay? He whispered to me (the kitchen door leads to the garage and MIL was in the kitchen) ""I'm waiting for mom to go back to her office so I can bring in the coffee"". I just looked at him funny, he followed up with something like -- ""She'll get upset if she sees this and I didn't get her one"".  (Another situation of living with her)

• Triangulation is absolutely real with this one. Had the SIL reach out once to hubby and once to me, for seperate issues. 

• While the SIL told me MIL thinks I resent her (that I specificallyresent MIL for clarity), her mom (MIL) told SIL that she thinks we speak badly about her all the time. So yea, MIL doesn't see me in a positive light at all. Then even the SIL said I resented her, which I told her I don't resent anyone. 

• MIL was upset that she didn't feel included about the baby gender reveal, although she was invited to Thanksgiving (although 2 states away) to celebrate. Told SIL lies about this situation (to long to explain), and basically upseted my mom. We compromised and did a small immediate family gender reveal with MIL, SIL, my mom, my brother/girlfriend, step father, and Hubby. I slipped up the day before the gender reveal in front of MIL saying ""he"". At the gender reveal she said I already know its a boy. My mom was devastated. 

• Lastly, before this gets any longer. Baby shower. My mom did her absolute best to include her, including picking the dates. MIL still lied to SIL and god knows who else in their family about not feeling included... we moved the date for her and has no interest in co hosting, inviting her family, or friends. During the whole argument (the argument for the gender reveal and baby shower happened within a week span) she mentions to me - ""Well its not like I'm the one opening gifts. "" and a seperate occasion, saying this more than once - ""We didn't have gender reveals or baby showers growing up, its all extra"". 

Then why complain about not feeling included, when you were included and then dismiss the events and not care about other people's feelings. 

------
Anyways, I'm grieving (maybe that is to strong of a word) the fact that I will never have a great relationship with MIL and her family. This is not what I wanted. I don't trust her when the baby arrives. How do you emotionally process this and move on? Generally good at compartmentalizing drama and not taking things personally. 

------
TLDR - Pattern of MIL behavior that is toxic, hubby is starting to see it. Grieving the loss of not having a great MIL relationship or her family. Needing advice to compartmentalize this and not give my power away. ",1,1765224071.0,JUSTNOMIL,1,1.0,False
1phmkrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCroommates/comments/1phmkrm/looking_for_longterm_sublet_or_lease_break/,looking for long-term sublet or lease break starting feb 1,"Hi all,

&nbsp;


I'll be moving to NYC on Jan 17 from Seattle and am looking for a long-term sublet/lease starting Feb 1st. I'll be sub-letting my friends spot from Jan 17-Feb 1st in Williamsburg. I'd ideally like to stay within the Williamsburg/East Williamsburg area/Bed-Stuy area but am open to the Clinton Hill/Park Slope/Prospect Heights area! Also, looking only to have one other roommate, if possible. My budget is $2000, willing to push to $2250 if the space is legit.

&nbsp;

About me: I'm a 34M who works as a product manager for a tech company. I like to workout, travel a lot, go to music festivals, play video games, and try new restaurants and cocktail bars. I prioritize keeping a clean and quiet apartment and hope to find a roommate who appreciates the same.

&nbsp;

Let me know if you are interested. I am going to be in town from Dec 12-24 and I would love to grab coffee/check out the spot and see if we are good fit",1,1765224021.0,NYCroommates,0,1.0,False
1phmjen,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1phmjen/a_guy_approached_me_i_feel_i_blew_it/,A guy approached me & I feel I blew it,"35f. I was having coffee with my friend last night and there was a cute guy sitting a few tables near us working on his laptop. After an hour or two of being at the café, he approaches our table and talks to me, which caught me really off guard. 

He said my style was unique and he really liked it. He asked where I got my style from and I just said shyly from my mind and thanked him. I'm shy and I felt I could have elaborated more, plus, although I do think I am attractive, my friend is usually the one who always gets hit on more when we go out. So I was surprised he approached me and not her. He then asked for my name, he told me his name and shook my hand and said it was nice to meet me. But that was it. I thought he'd ask for my number or social media. 

I wish I had said more, like how I noticed his cool stickers on his laptop or asked if he was a podcaster, because I thought he was doing some kind of video or audio work at the cafe. I only know his name, which is a very common male name in this big city.

My friend said maybe he was shy too and didn't ask for my contact info. Should I have done that? Again I was really caught off guard, shy, and usually it's my friend who gets approached first when we're out. I go to this cafe often, it's one of my favorites. I've never seen him before but he was sitting with a guy who was working and I've seen who I assume is his friend (they both left together) three times already there but never him. 

I guess I'm wondering: 1) how should I have done better? 2) Was it okay not to give him my number or social media since he didn't ask? 3) If I see him again, should I approach him or at least wave and smile? 4) If I see the guy he was sitting next to again without the guy who approached me, should I ask him to give that guy my info?

1phmhn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/JeffNippard/comments/1phmhn1/fundamentals_on_a_cut/,Fundamentals on a cut?,"Hey folks, I've got a trip to Costa Rica planned in March of next year and I'm looking to lean up a bit before hand. Could use some insight.

Base stats: 47 years old, been lifting pretty consistently since my early 30s. Started at 230 lbs, and worked my way down to a consistent 180-185lbs by the time I entered my 40s. I'm 5'8, and currently have the fluffy look of a layer of chub over good muscle. No supplements other than protein powder occasionally (never like how it made me bloated and chunky looking).  No testosterone (naturally high 800 plus, but I do think there are other hormone issues that I havent worked out. Weight loss is very hard for me). I've got decent PRs, Squat is 330, deads are at 405 (would be higher, but Rhumatoid arthritis is causing some issues in my grip), and bench at 275.   Diet isn't tracked super carefully, but three squares a day consisting of about 6-8oz of what ever the protein is, a small veggie portion and no more than a half cup of grains or starchy sides.  I do drink, maybe a cocktail with dinner every other day, maybe 2-3  more so on Fridays if I go out, or date nights with my fiance. Biggest culprit of weight challenges is snacking at work on garbage and I'm addicted to light and sweet coffee. The weight loss from 230-185 (and 175 during COVID) has left me with a saggy fat looking mid section that I'm self conscious about. 

Programs: started with all pros full body years ago, and progressed through various types of splits. The last year and half I've been moving through Nippards programs and just about to finish the powerbuilding 1, 4 days a week. I seem to respond best to full body type programs, and hitting everything twice a week at a min at good intensity. I like the full body cycles Nippard has because I actually feel like I'm pushing my body without breaking it down to much (I had a lot of junk volume in prior programs). 

Wanted some thoughts about maintenance and whether the hypertrophy fundamentals would be a good fit while cutting calories. The only way I've ever successfully lost weight is via high stress/anxiety during tough times, or by completely cutting meals entirely (example being a recent cruise. Food was largely inedible, so I was only eating breakfast egg white omlets and lost 5 lbs over the trip. It all came back of course, but seeing actual muscles was kinda nice).  So my current plan is to drop my portions down to 4-6 oz protein and 1/4 cup worth of grains or starches per meal and add in extra protein for maintenance with a protein shake. If that doesn't work, then cut lunches and stick with the protein shake.  I hate doing cardio, but the appeal of the full body hypertrophy is that it only takes 3 days of lifts, which means I can slot in some cardio on off days (which I tend to not do as I'm already lifting for an hr and half to two hrs depending on how accessible or crowded the gym is).

So can I keep what I've gained, loose some of the fat with a moderate calories cut, loss of extra protein (I think about 100 grams day between 2-3 meals and a shake), and doing 3 full body days and two days of extra cardio? ",2,1765223821.0,JeffNippard,0,1.0,False
1phmf3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1phmf3o/we_have_to_eat_a_baby_every_time_we_land_a_plane/,We have to eat a baby every time we land a plane," I arrived at the airport at the recommended time, 2 hours before departure; weary and anxious about the 6-hour flight ahead of me. Over the course of my life, I've managed to avoid flying with an iron vigor: despite the many situations it reared its ugly head into. I would drive three days straight, with only power naps to get me by, if it meant I didn't have to fly there. A feat I’ve taken many times. This recent predicament left me very few options; which driving was not one. 

While eating at a Golden Corral my dad got a wishbone lodged in his windpipe. By the time they got it dislodged he was already a shade of violet and lacking oxygen in his brain. While stable now, he might not be for very long: leaving this state of urgency. And the prospect that, if I don't see him now, I may never again. Thus, my FOMO negated my fear of flying, and forced my hand into buying a ticket.

I trembled all the way through TSA, and the long walk to my gate: practically fossilized in my seat by the time my section was called to board. I whipped out my phone, my boarding pass illuminated on its greasy screen. I wasn't even sure how long I stood there trying to scan my pass; my shaky hands making the code impossible to read. The ramp operator took special notice of me when the barcode was read. She must've noticed my petrification. 

""We really appreciate you"". She said with an uncurated genuinity in her tone. 

""Uh..thanks. I appreciate you too"" 

I thought about the exchange down the entire ramp, was I weird or was she. Nobody could've expected her to say that. Nobody would've had a response prepared. Like a miscalculated: “You too.”, in response to a, “Enjoy the show.”, at a ticket booth. Hopefully my face would be lost in the mass of people she sees everyday. 

When I came face to face with the plane's door; I ground the line of passengers to a halt. My eyes were fixed to the gap between the ramp and plane. The sound of engines and wind so loud, through just half a foot of space. Already we were so high up. I could fall through the gap if I was 90lbs lighter: break my ankle on impact. I snapped back to reality, and knew it was socially unexceptable to stand here any longer. The groans of the other passengers grew ever clear, along with the act of a kid tugging on his mom's dress, asking why we were waiting. If that kid isn't afraid, I shouldn't be either. I had no choice but to pass through the Gate to Hell, and join the Army of the Damned. 

As I stepped over the gap it's as if my soul did slip out of me; straight through it: just a skid mark on the tarmac. My confidence was already ailing. 

Then the wheel on my suitcase got caught on the outside of the door. I started tugging and twisting; looking back to assess the problem only to be met with a dozen or so faces, watching hatefully. With a hardy yank my carry-on was freed, one less wheel, and a date with the dump when this trip was over. I couldn't even look the flight attendants in the eyes when I rounded the corner, and started down the aisle to my seat. 

When I made it to my row the three seats were empty. Which brought a slight sense of relief, as my seat, was in my middle. I thought maybe, I would get the chance to take an Advil PM, and sprawl out across the seats. I was clenched into my seat for only a few minutes, when my rowmate to my left arrived. 

He was a portly man: adorned with a Cannibal Corpse shirt, full tattoo sleeve, and skull sandals. Despite what I may have expected him to be like, he ended up being rather friendly: simply greeting me, and plopping into his seat. His smell became a bit hard to bear. It was like: a very masculine, mahogany forest cologne, with a dusting of baby powder. Under normal circumstances, I likely wouldn't have noticed; but my stomach already in knots, and my senses heightened; the scent was very nauseating.

The arrival of my rowmate to the right, nearly made me flip my lid. It was a child. Roughly six or seven, his mom pushed him to our row, and turned his head from his tablet to his seat. The man and I had to get up to make way for the kid; carefully stepping in the spaces between our bags. The kid paid no mind to our bags however, stepping on mine bag to get to his seat. His mom had only enough energy to scold him in a defeated exclamation. With the gifting of a, tablet she parted ways; squeezing her way back up the aisle; so many rows away; too far to call for help. 

The depth of the situation was becoming dire; like I’m 20 leagues under the sea and the pressure is about to blow in the hall. The kid started watching a video of a man, with a painfully obnoxious voice, playing some children's game. It became quickly evident that the kid, did not have headphones; and I would have to listen to his videos until the tablet died. Who knows what torture would come after the tablet died. 

The Captain eventually introduced himself, and gave his words of reassurance that, despite the six hour flight ahead of us, there will be no problems along the way. Then came the safety demonstration from the flight attendants; the display was sickening. They tried to be humorous, to relieve tension, or amuse us: I’m not sure but it didn’t work. Just a stark reminder that a life jacket and breathing mask, doesn’t fare well against high altitude combustion. Nor would it be helpful if I was flung from the plane. It's rock from start to finish; when I meet the ground at mach 10 speeds, the life jacket would be an orange lump in a red puddle. 

Takeoff was horrible. My fingers bored wedges into the ends of the arm rests; latched to them like I was riding a roller coaster. The pressure in my ears sunk into a faint ring, until they popped thirty minutes into the flight. By that time, the man in the aisle seat was already knocked out. As it turns out, he had horrible sleep apnea. His head would be flopped back, mouth wide open, really letting his snore travel through the cabin. Sometimes he would choke, his tongue falling back into his throat, forcing him to burst awake when his body realized he was dying. The first time this happened, his arm flung out and hit me: I let out a yelp that disturbed everyone around us further. He apologized, but before he seemed to finish his sentence, he was back asleep: head slumped over his shoulder, facing me. I tried to push it away with my pointer finger, but it always rolled its way back; eventually slumping onto my shoulder, that's when I really pushed him away. The second time he choked himself awake, a flight attendant had just rolled the cart through, having to lift his head out of the aisle to get past him. The sample of pepsi she had given me, made its way onto me when the man knocked it out of my hands. 

""I'm so sorry man, I didn't mean to"". The man said as I used my sleeve to pat dribblets of pepsi off my face. He was slumped over snoring again immediately after. 

The kid was still glued to his tablet; his neck craned over, as it sat in his lap. The poor kid was doomed to have a turtles neck when he reached his golden years: shoulders all slouched, connected to the collar with a protruding spiny bump. The dreaded moment arrived too soon, his tablet died; he wasted no time to ask for his mom. Tugging on my sleeve, seeing if I knew where she was. I told him she was in front of us, but it must not have registered, as he continued to ask. I didn't know what to do, I thought I could just pick him up and set him in the aisle, let him look for her, but then I would be holding a stranger's kid. I looked around frantically, evaluating my options. The only thing I could think of was distracting him with the window. I slid up the window covering so he could see outside. It was haunting. No clouds in sight to obscure the view. An incomprehensible height, so far from the natural world, where man is meant to be. It was a bad distraction as well, the view entertained him for a few minutes before realizing it was more fun to open and close the cover. The slow flashing of the bright sky, coupled with a glimpse into the end with every opening was maddening.

 Maybe a compassionate stranger complained, or the flight attendant just took notice, but she approached me with a proposal. She asked if I would like to be upgraded to first class to give my seat to the boy's mother. I naturally accepted. 

The walk to first class was awkward, shaking the pinprick numbness in my legs, and trying desperately not to rub my tailbone. What I couldn’t shake was the knowledge that beneath my feet was nothing but air. Nothing but a shear drop outside of this tin can. 

Through the curtain to first class was a much prettier scene. Individual cubbies, their exterior trimmed with rippled aluminum cladding. Each cubby privatized with curtains of their own: beautiful blue velvet, with gold fringed borders. One of the curtains was open; exposing a man in a formal suit, his tie undone, and buttons popped. Stuffed to the brim and comatosed, after having gorged himself on a roasted bird. It was 

quiet and elegant up here, not a child's crying to be heard. 

Where I was going; however, stood out from these booths. Stood out in the way that it blended in: there wasn’t a curtain to identify it; there wasn’t much of a door either. The flight attendant slid a card down a thin seam that, if you were looking for it, could be seen running from floor to ceiling. Grabbing onto the outer ridge and moving it leftwards, the wall folded in on itself, squeezing against the wall like a collapsable fan. She moved out of the way and presented the room with a show of her hand: a sweet lavender smell rushed out of the doorway, trying desperately to fill the first class’s, scentless vacuum. I slowly pressed in, careful not to disturb the sanctuary's atmosphere.

“Make yourself comfortable, it’s all yours.” She slid the door closed behind me and the room worked to replenish its aroma. 

Contrary to the minimalist aluminum that sheathed the plane inside and out, the interior of this room was wooden. Slat panels with acoustic foam underneath: the only light coming from red strips where the plane's cylindrical body requires the wall to slope inwards. The reminder that I was, in fact, on a plane, caused my stomach to sink; an unexpected blow after a period of tranquility. My momentary comfort only ensured the impact hurt worse when I fell from my pedestal. The room fought to draw me back in: it whispered classical music into my ears from an unseen source. 

In the center of the room was a round, solo dining table; stained dark and well polished: a napkin folded into the shape of a bird sat as the centerpiece. The accompanying seat looked to be a massage chair: leg nooks, a cubic brutalist body, and wrapped in maroon leather. Most of the wall behind it was dedicated to a water feature; one that had a thin waterfall that ran down a pane of tempered glass. Flowing down into a trough where large, flowered, lily pads jiggled around on top of the water, and red LEDs shown from below. 

I sunk into the chair, engulfed in its fluff, and surrounded by rubber pistons. Embedded into the armrest was a control panel, far more settings than on a mall chair; and luckily the absence of a cash slot. The buttons were not easy to discern however; all were different glowing colors, with white, seemingly random symbols on their faces. As I went through clicking the buttons, some connection could be gleaned between their symbol and function. The horizontal zigzag activated the massager, the turtle and rabbit buttons controlled speed, three wavy vertical lines were the heater, and the exclamation mark was to call in a flight attendant. I only realized the last one when a lady walked in, as I was whincing at the chair's, borderline painful massage feature. 

""Is the room to your liking?"" she asked. 

""Oh definitely, it's very nice. This is all very unexpected. I feel kinda outta place. Don’t get me wrong I appreciate it—it’s just, yeah, unexpected”

“You aren’t out of place at all, it was reserved for you."" She said with a consistent cadence, happy, but not enthusiastic; and a thin smile that wasn’t overbearingly consumer friendly, but definitely choreographed. She spoke very hushed, and matter-of-factly. 

""How's that? I bought the cheapest ticket I could."" 

""Well, it was selected at 'random'."" She said while using airquotes. 

""What does ‘random’ mean?"" 

""It’s determined by a computer, so as ‘random’ as they can be. There's still code and statistics involved, it’s not drawing sticks, but it does help us find you.” 

“Is there a reason for this?"" 

“The room or the ritual?” She asked with a lifted brow.

“The what now? A ritual?”

“I probably shouldn’t have called it that, the company likes to call it a ‘transaction’.” She said using air quotes again.

“Well what is the transaction!” My tone rising and becoming desperate.

“It’s just something that has to be done.” She said putting her hands up and backing up a couple of steps. ""A company policy, for safety reasons I think. I don’t know specifics, the captain usually gives the rundown by now; he can explain it better than me.” Stepping back further.

“You have to tell me more, you can’t say that then leave.”

“I-I’ll see if I can get the captain. Hang tight for a second.” She said with an increasingly shaky voice, before quickly spinning around, her Farrah Fawcett hair flinging over her shoulder as she dashed to the door. The sound of the door closing was followed by multiple and simultaneous locks moving into place.

I paced around the room waiting for the man to come: my mind was running through a rolodex of possible rituals. If she even meant it in the ghoulish, sacrifice a virgin way, she could’ve meant a tradition. I really needed a release, it felt like I was going to choke on my anxiety, so I figured it was as good a time as any to pick a drink off the wall. Across from the table was a shelved wall stocked with a large selection of alcohol. All were in ornate decanters, the names of the contents etched into a gold plaque in front of them. It's not much of an exaggeration to say the collection contained every intoxicating beverage. There were many high end liquors, easily worth..I don’t even know how much; then a few were filled with cheap, working man's beer.

As I poured myself a drink, three gentle knocks came from the door. After giving them the okay to come in, the captain slid open the door; gave me a chipper hello, and held out his hand to shake mine. I did not reciprocate. He had thick grey hair, from the looks of his mustache and curly mullet that poofed out from his tall, sturdy hat.

""What do you think about the room?"" He asked with a rancher’s twang in a slightly raspy voice.

“I want to know why I’m in here.”

“I apologize for this, transaction, being revealed to you in that way. Rosie is..well, she’s a bit ditsy I suppose. Lose her head if it weren’t screwed to her body kinda girl. I think it goes over better coming from my buttery smooth voice.” He said with a chuckle. 

“Can you cut to it, this is maddening.”

“Yes you’re right, enough beaten around the horse.” He sighed and rolled his eyes before locking them back to mine. Their blue color fading into a grey as well. “Look, every flight we are obligated to do this. It ain’t pretty, but the consequences are far worse. Okay?” Looking at me with those wide, piercing eyes.

“Yes?”

“Somebody, on every flight, in this case you, has to eat a baby. Alright?”

“No, not alright. What are you talking about?”

“Listen, I know how you feel; I was in your spot once; so has my co-pilot, and most of the flight attendants. A whole hell of a lot of folks have been in your shoes. None of us liked it. Well most of us didn’t like it, but that’s just how it is.”

“You’re full of shit. This can’t be true”

“Nuh uh, this is definitely real. This is how it’ll go, when you agree to our terms, the chef will…”

“I’m not listening to this, I’m shutting you down, la la la la” He grabbed my side, right under my ribs and squeezed tight. I whimpered and grabbed his hand to try to push it away but his grip was deadlocked. 

“Now would you cut that out, what I’m trying to tell you is important. I can’t stress enough how crucial this duty is. Are you willing to be civilized if I let you go?”

“Yes..” I said between blowing spastic breaths through my reddening cheeks.

“When you agree, the chef will come in, prepare the meal, and you will eat the whole thing, all before we land.”

“What happens if I don't?”

""The landing gear will malfunction, it’ll only partially deploy. When we touch down we will tip, port side, the left wing will touch ground, and break off bit by bit until it reaches the engine. An explosion will ensue that’ll set the blades free; where they will rip into the cabin, slaughtering everyone in its path. We will lose all footing and the nose will plunge into the ground. First class will crumple instantly; the body will be split at the midsection; the rear will flip over seven times until it collapses. There will be only one survivor. You.""

""That’s..not true."" I had nothing else to say, I could barely get those words out as the scenario played out in front of my eyes. Like a film scrolling across them, a reel of a thousand frames, displaying the most vile scene. The horrifying sight, a stark reality, but brought on by a barbaric fable. Just a masochist’s tale.

""The chef will be in to prepare dinner shortly."" he said, patting the table and hoisting himself up, a series of brittle pops came from his knee. He brushed off his pant leg and strode out lankily through that deceptive door. I envied that freedom. The room never felt so small, and it was only becoming more cramped. 

I could still see the door’s seam, just as hidden as when I first came in, but now the ridges didn’t give as I tugged. Maybe it wasn’t there, I moved from groove to groove, pulling on each one. I scaled the wall like a mad man, pulling in places I knew it couldn’t be, but had no choice but to try anyway. I pounded on the door, throwing my body against it a few times until I bruised. I screamed, calling for someone who could not hear me, or would not care. The world outside the door was silent, as I was to them, for that time I didn’t exist and neither did they. That is a horrid and insoluble isolation. When my over exertion gave way to lightheadedness I involuntarily slide down the wall. Through blurry eyes and a swiveling head I tried to ground myself, but the fog only grew. I felt feverish, as if my eyes could water and sink into my burning face. Then came an unnatural drowsiness; like my weighted blanket made its way up to my face and was smothering me. Naturally the darkness gave way to sleep.

I regained consciousness all at once, a prick in the inner pit of my elbow sending a zap of urgency into my heart. A bulbous nose and a dark, thick, mustache filled my frame of vision. When he put some space between us, I could see those features belonged to a robust man in a chefs attire, holding a syringe. 

Trying to squirm only amounted to the realization that I had been bound to the chair. My hands were duct taped in one large, bulbous mass, my exposed fingers stuck to a knife in my left, and a fork in my right. 

The man walked over to the kitchenette; flicking keys around a ring, sifting through a hoard of them to find the few he needed. One buy one he unlocked units of the kitchen that I couldn’t get into. The hanging cupboard and minifridge on either side a tiered display of spices between them. The man put on an apron, a white fluffy hat; then turned to me. A wide smile on his face, silicon molded dimples on full display: brightly lit by his ivory veneers, one of which had disappeared, the tiny shaved remnants of his true tooth on full display. And his eyes squinted shut; likely the result of botox losing its potency; his puffy dark eyelids left sitting awkwardly on smooth, pearshaped cheeks. 

""What'll it be?"" he said. ""Soup or Salad?"" in a very heavy, coarse accent. 

""Go fuck yourself."" I said before thrashing around to no avail. My biceps were taped against my chest, a zip tie joining my arms at the elbow: and my legs were clamped tight in their massaging nooks. 

""no no. Not a option. Soup or Salad."" 

""I’m not eating anything. I don’t know what sick game you are playing, but I’m not a part of it."" 

“But you see, this is no game. It’s ah..a requirement, you can understand that.""

“No I cannot. I don’t understand how someone can eat a child.”

""You are not eating the baby yet. Just appetizers to start."" 

""Like I said, I’m not eating."" 

""The soup is a very fresh Gnocchi, with ingredients straight from the homeland. Or the crisp caprese salad, also grown from the fertile fields of home.” 

“Where are you from?”

“Across the sea.”

“That applies to everyone.”

“Me most of all.”

I figured it was not worth acknowledging him; that paying attention to him would become maddening: like realizing a gnat is buzzing around your ear and no longer able to ignore it.

 ""I know what you want, the salad, yes?""...""Excellent choice!"" 

He opened a metal compartment which released a mist that snuck out around the edges. Chilled ingredients were sorted on the compact shelves. With expert speed he chopped and tossed the salad, placing it on the table with an extended arm, before folding it behind his back and finishing with a bow.

""Say when."" he said, grating a block of cheese into the bowl. Whether it came from the man, cheese or salad I couldn’t decide, but a pungent smell hit me all at once. Even when the block of cheese was shredded in its entirety into my salad I didn't say a word.

 ""Oh my friend, I hope you chew thoroughly. This may be no bueno on its way out."" he said with a deep laugh, and returned to his station. After dropping the grater and some other dishes in the sink he clapped his hands together and said his goodbyes. 

""Au revoir mon ami, I do hope you enjoy. I’ll begin dinner when you're ready."" 

""I'm telling you now, I’m not gonna be ready."" 

""Ah, I have a hunch that you will be."" 

The next 20 minutes crawled by. Thrashing around in my seat had no noticeable effect on my restraints. Despite my forearms having some mobility, my range of motion only allowed my to move my useless hands to my face. The sharp golden utinzels in my hand were just a bait, telling I could cut myself loose. In reality all I could do was bring them straight up to my face; which did provide an out if it came to that. 

""It looks like you haven't touched your salad. Is it no good?"" He said when he returned.

""I told you I wasn't eating it."" 

""Then you must be saving your appetite for the main course, yes?"" 

""No."" 

""I will prepare the meal anyway. The smell of food always brings out hunger."" 

Opening the mysterious remaining cabinet beside the spice rack, with two gentle hands the chef reached in for something. From out of it he pulled a little mass of cloth, pulling it into the crease of his arms and readjusting its weight. He turned around and in a very soft tone he said. 

""Do you have any allergies?"" 

In his arms was a: plump, blond, sleeping baby, swaddled in a blanket. 

""Oh my god.. It's real.. It's really happening"" I said under my breath.

""I pride myself on never having allergized one of my guests, I want that to continue."" 

I can only imagine I was stark white, with bulging eyes and a slacked jaw, that’s how I felt anyway. An anxiety welling up inside me, far more deep and poignant than what had plagued me hours ago. Those feelings seemed so trivial now. What I would give to be a cowering, small man, in my economy seat again. 

""No allergies? Excellent, the preparations can begin."" 

He plugged the sink and began filling it with water. 

“How can you do this? This is sick, all of this.”

“Somebody has to do it. I have to prepare the meal. You have to eat it. Like it or not, it must be done.”

""I won’t eat it. You'll be killing him for nothing."" 

""Her, actually. That's all that we know. She has no name. No family. No identification. Seven people knows she exists. Nobody will know she's gone."" 

I began to cry. My head falling as far as my restraints would allow, and I sobbed with choking gasps. 

""you can't...you can't do it.."" 

He turned off the sink and looked at me with a viscous scowl, the first time he's dropped the chipper persona. 

""You are unreasonable."" 

He placed the baby back in the cupboard, slapped its door shut and stormed out of the room. I continued to weep even though a slight relief developed, thinking I got out of it. The pressure put on me, and the evil this room has concealed, still crushing me. It felt tainted, a sour putrid air, under the veil of lavender vapor. The smell, I thought was just a placebo, my mind molding the room into my narrative, but something was definitely seeping into the room. 

At first it made my mouth feel foamy; like it was drying out, and a mucky film remained. Then it was arid; a bitter taste like a dentist's numbing paste, laid on top of my sandpaper tongue. The draught moved down my throat, sucking air out with it: it wasn't long before a hiccup like gasp flared up under my sternum. I choked and I coughed, a series of convulsions working to bring something up from inside of me. I started to vomit, spewing from my nose at the first release, the stinging was horrid and the sight was repulsive. The bile seeping in between my clamped thighs. While the vomiting was unpleasant, the dry heaving was torturous. My empty stomach had no more to give; but the gagging carried on. 

At some point the classical music died out, whether it was before my gagging fit or during, I didn’t notice; but when musical ambiance was reintroduced into the room, it was impossible to ignore. Heavy metal, at a headache inducing volume, snapped into the room full bore. I don’t remember what was played in between, but the torture begun with Slayer and ended with Disturbed

Gallons of sweat poured out of me; soaking me in my DIY leather bound sauna. My man-made lubrication proved ineffective in my attempt to slip free: although my efforts had become lackluster; only energy left to swing my head around. I never passed out, that would’ve been a blessing. I danced so close to the land between heat exhaustion, and suffocation: always to be pulled back, into a state of gas induced bulimia. Eventually the gasping did end, far beyond the last point I could’ve been grateful. My whole body was dry, wrung out and depleted of moisture: my sweat soaked body had evaporated, leaving behind a meat scent on my crunchy clothes. 

I barely noticed that someone had entered the room, until my head was pushed into the leather headrest. My crusty, bloodshot eyes fought to see through the grain and piercing light. An unexpected stream of liquid hit them in the pupil and finally caught their attention. Prying hands pulled open my mouth and shot the stream down my throat, no stopping when it grazed my uvulae. I blinked my eyes clear, and hacked water at the hands until they left my mouth. Finally able to see two flight attendants, wearing thin plastic ponchos, over their tightly pressed uniforms. 

""Have you decided to do it yet?"" One asked; a squirt bottle in hand. 

Still drippling and spitting up the excess water I hacked a glob at his shoes, hitting it right in the toe. He clenched his teeth, then his hands, and busted me in the cheek. 

""Mike! We aren't supposed to do that. You'll bruise your knuckles"". The female attendant said, placing a concerned hand on his crinkly shoulder. 

""Let's just get this over with.” He said, while pulling up his ankle and furiously taking a handkerchief to his shoe.

The lady walked to a metal cart they had wheeled in: a dinky thing with four slender legs, and two shelves holding only a few items. She carefully slipped on two oversized leather gloves, flapping the loose fingers around like an old cathers mit. She scrunched the fingers around the tiny handle on an aluminum tray. Steam poured out around the edge of the lid as she opened it: some wrapping around her forearm, urging her to yank away; murmuring obscenities under her breath. 

With long tongs, she reached into the tray and pulled out a folded blue towel, giving it a little shake, before making her strut back to me. 

""This is your last opportunity. We land in two hours. It'll take most of that time for dinner to be prepared and served. We hope you realize what's at stake here."" The lady said. 

""We’re sure you are a rational man. You can do the math, this is one life to ensure the safety of 90."" The man added 

""If ‘morality’ is the cause of your hangup, you must find it immoral to let 90 innocent passengers die"". Said she, it becoming clear at this point they intended to alternate dialogue.

""Deaths that you are aware will occur, as a product of your inaction."" 

""You will not be able to plead ignorance in the life that follows. The blood will stain your hands alone."" 

My breathing had become choppy, not as much from physical torture, but of that going on in my head. Proof that my tear ducts were once again operational, tears fell down my face, mixing into the open wound on my left cheek, and down the blood stream that collected under my chin. 

""I can't do it."" I said between sobs 

""Damn."" The woman said before grabbing my mess of hair and yanking my head back. The red ceiling lights became eclipsed by the blue towel hovering over my face. The tongs released and it slapped onto my face. The sequence of events moved so quickly it took a second for the pain to fully manifest. The heat grew from warm,to unpleasant, to searing. I tried to shake it off but the hand left my hair and grabbed the ends of the towels, snagging it tight around my face. The suffocation went unnoticed while the 2nd degree burn was fresh.

An immediate cooling soothed my face briefly; cold water washing over the burns. The sensation of bliss lasted a moment before the water found my airways. The towel was ripped away, dribblets of water and flesh trailing in the air after it. Intense pain rippled across my face with every hack and cough, trying to clear water from my throat. Bubbling masses coming into view around the edges of my eyes: blisters rising without hesitation. 

""This can end whenever you want!"" The woman said, holding the towel near her chest. 

I had no reserved air to respond with, all I could do was shake my head. Though the torture was unbareable, it was what I deserved. If I would be the only one to crawl through this plane's debris, over the bodies of people I could've saved, I was willing to pay for it. 

The torment went on like that for, god knows how long. The world was reduced to sensations; as if my mind only extended as far as my body. I knew more was out there, but in my restraints, and subdued by my torturers, I was the only person in a tight void. The only relevance time had to me was the hope that I could run out their clock. 

They eventually removed the towel for the last time, and put themselves back together, to resume their facade for the passengers. It didn't matter much anymore, how the passengers saw them, or if they even carried on with their job. There wasn't enough time for dinner. Our fate was sealed. 

I was in paralysis for the remainder of the trip. We hit patches of turbulence periodically, any disturbance felt as if it could’ve been the last. None of it startled me, the extent of my acknowledgement was feeling my head bob and sway around. I experienced something I rarely ever did: complete complacency. 

No smooth words, great performance, bribe, promise, or wish, would change what was coming. A terrible thing, but it was inevitable now. It was just me, and a short stretch of time before the course of my life would be split in two. It was absolute clarity without the peace. Moreso a desperate acceptance; the terms were very grim, but I made a choice. 

I likely could've escaped in that time. My restraints had become waterlogged and lost much of their grip. With enough thrashing they could've come undone; but where to go after that? That is the horror of an aircraft, the hopelessness that comes when you board. People have no clue where the real horror lies. People have no clue about the room nestled near the cockpit, where a dinner is forced on a passenger every flight. 

A buttery smooth voice entered the room like spoiled milk. The pilot's voice came over the entercom. 

""Ladies and Gentlemen, we are beginning to make our descent. The local time is 3:19, and the sky is clear. We want to thank you for flying with us today, and wish you safe travels ahead."" 

Then a flight attendant entered the room. Clacking her heels towards me before placing a hand on my shoulder and shoving my back into the seat. My eyes met hers, and she spoke through gritted teeth. 

""I hope you're happy. Mr. Lucky. Make sure to live it up, for us."" 

She reached over me, to grab a bottle of liquor. She pulled out a scattering of loose pills, and scarfed them all down. Flicking the decanters plug off with her thumb she took a big swig, some trickling out the sides of her mouth. Wiping her face clean she walked to the far wall, pressing her back to it and sliding down to the floor. 

""The Captain said I could if I stayed in here. I want to be out cold before we land."" 

Other flight attendants entered, also pouring themselves drinks and lying on the floor as we made our way closer to the ground. They berated me for what I did to them: cursed my name, put hex’s on my bloodline. I only felt pity for them. If this was how they wanted to spend their final moments, I would allow it. I thought it was a true display of their character, to end their lives like that. Letting their cruelness seep out. The finality of the death bed, does have a way of revealing truths. The most raw look at someone's life, and how it consistently ends. I wanted to die with my morality intact: I lost that the moment I booked this flight. 

Our ears began popping and we knew we were getting close. The pill popper had already faded away, others were severely wasted, and sobbing came from the ones who only managed a buzz. The wheels touched the ground hard. An anticipated feeling, but was impossible to prepare for. Multiple bounces up and down as the tires made contact, only to lose its footing right after. It rattled my empty stomach; its deep, hollow ache returning after a long absence. The tilting took longer than expected, it could’ve been happening without our knowledge. But the anticipation only grew, the dread becoming unbearable, for an event everyone assumed to be instant. The plane sturdied itself, and the force pressing on our bodies lightened. We were slowing down. Not the violent slowing of the wing scrapping tar, it was completely mechanical. Even as the plane drove around the landing strips, slowly taking corners, we couldn't be certain the accident was avoided. If fate was at play, an unexpected and contrived sequence of events could take place any moment. But the plane docked. The captain came into the room, summoning the attendants to assist the passengers as they exited. 

""It didn't happen."" one of the attendants said with a flabbergasted expression, ""This has never happened."" 

""My god."" another said, ""Was it a lie? Did I do it for nothing!"" She clutched her face and began to sob. 

The pilot quickly shooed the in-tact attendants out of the room, shutting the door behind them. He stepped over the sobber who had sprawled herself across the floor, with her face pressed against the wood: her muffled sobs trickled out between the cracks, as did her tears. Taking a tiny pair of scissors out of his pocket he started to cut at the duct tape. 

""This will take a while. I can't bring anything larger on board. You know how strict the rules are."" 

""We didn't crash. You were lying."" I said

""I was not. This is unexpected. Incredibly rare."" 

""That's bullshit. Why would this flight be the one that's spared?"" 

""It's not our place to know, or ask. This is a blessing, count it as one. And tread lightly, charity comes at a cost to someone."" 

He finished cutting at my bonds, I stretched and squeezed my hands to regain the feeling that I had done so long without. They shook as I, numb and feebly pulled at the dangling tape. It was a laborious task that I knew going into it I wouldn't finish. I stood up with strips still clung to me; bunching up the back of my jacket, and tucked into my pants. I was covered in the residual stickiness, the blotchy film that remains, even after paint has been torn from the walls. My smell was atrocious too, layers of sweat and B.O. with a bile finish. It would soon be masked though.

The pilot came in with a half filled coffee pot. From an arms length away he stopped walking and flung it my way. The coffee sloshed out, and engulfed my face. As it wrapped around my head I braced for the scorching to set in, but it was only mild. No more pain than if anything touched my already peeled, and blistered face. As it settled in, it proved to be incredibly thick and dark; like laundry detergent stained black. 

""It's been on the burner for a very long time. We call it diesel, thick as oil and will have you running all night."" He said. 

""What's your fucking problem?"" I asked as I shook beads of the slop off my hands, and fanned out my soaked shirt. 

""When you get off the plane, head to the medical station and tell them about your accident. Then call our company, file a complaint and show them your face. They will apologize, promise to brew the coffee colder, and pay you off."" 

""People have to know what happened here. They'll stop flying if they do."" 

""You know people won't stop flying. This tech is a miracle. Even with the baggage that comes with it."" 

Two flight attendants returned, having escorted everyone else off the plane. 

""Would you two carry her to the medics?” Nudging the unconscious woman with his foot. “Bring our volunteer with you while you're at it."" The pilot said, placing a firm hand on my damp shoulder. I swatted it off and gathered up my things as the attendants held the woman in the air, one at her feet, the other under her shoulders. Her hands dragged the entire way, we stopped a few times to cross them over her body but they always fell again. 

I sat in the medics station for a while, all it amounted to was giving me a change of clothes, and ice for my face. They said I would have to be transferred to a nearby hospital for real treatment. As I waited for the squad to arrive, I used the time to reach out to my family. I knew my mom would be antsy to know how the flight went, but more urgently I had to tell them what hospital I was going to. When I turned my phone off of airplane mode I received a wall of notifications, with numerous missed calls, and texts from my family. I called my mom back, ringing multiple times, before a soft, quiet, hello picked up. 

""Hey Mom, what's going on?"" 

""Did you just land?"" she asked. 

""Yeah a little bit ago, I'm still at the airport. Is everything alright?"" 

""Your Dad started getting really bad a couple hours ago. His throat is very swollen with an infection, and it could lead to pneumonia. They put him on a ventilator, and we’re waiting for the swelling to go down so they can remove some of the fluid. If he goes in for surgery, it’ll be very risky, and they want us to see him, in case, it doesn’t go well.""

His blade severed armies.  
His power ended wars.

Yet he was never fully evil.  
He protected humanity—  
and in the same breath,  
separated humans and demons forever.

The clash between him and his brothers shook creation itself.  
No being could witness those battles and remain unmoved.  
They were jaw-dropping.  
Unforgettable.

The wars lasted thousands of years.  
Countless lives were lost.  
Not a single soul would ever forget his na—

“**Was this written by a child?**”

Akira squinted at the page.

“**How boring.**”

He snapped the book shut with a flick.

**TICK.**

“Ah— crap.”

A tiny slice appeared on his finger.  
He blew on it instinctively, holding it up.

He glanced around.

The librarian looked up at him for half a second—  
not in concern, not in suspicion—  
just in the universal way someone looks at *noise*.

She went right back to typing.  
Uninterested.  
Unbothered.  
Absolutely done with life.

Akira forced a laugh.

“Guess I’m gonna die from this papercut, huh?”

She didn’t even blink.

He muttered:

“…tough crowd.”

Silence.





**RING.**  
**RING.**  
**RING.**

Akira sighed and picked up his phone.

“…Hello.”

His posture straightened.  
His eyes sharpened.  
The casual warmth vanished.

A man’s voice blared through the speaker:

**“AKIRA!**  
**Listen, can you come in early today?**  
**Rimi just up and quit—didn’t even give notice.**  
**There’s a mountain of dishes and we’re swamped!”**

Akira exhaled heavily.

“…right.”

He blinked.

He put the book back on the shelf, yawning as he walked out of the aisle.

He pushed the library doors open.

Sunlight spilled across his face.

“…Nice,” he murmured, closing his eyes as he embraced the warmth.

Then he opened them.

And froze.

A swirling distortion hung in the air directly in front of him.

Like a tear in space.  
Like a glitch in reality.

*…Portal?*  
he thought.

Before his brain could even process the word—

**tap.**

A foot nudged the middle of his back.

Light.  
Lazy.  
Almost bored.

Yet somehow strong enough to knock him off his feet.

“H-HUH—?!”

His balance vanished.  
He pitched forward into the distortion.

Instinctively, he twisted mid-fall to see who touched him.

There—  
on the library steps—  
stood a woman.

She wore a full black bodysuit, long-sleeved and slightly baggy around the joints.  
Her dark red hair rested over one shoulder.  
Her eyes were hidden behind tinted black glasses.

Her leg hovered just slightly off the ground—  
the casual follow-through of someone who had just nudged a door closed…  
except the “door” was him.

No expression.  
No tension.  
No hostility.

Just a bored professional doing her job.

Akira’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“**The HELL—?!**”

The portal swallowed him whole before he could finish the sentence.

Light bent.  
Sound warped.  
Her figure vanished as he fell into the unknown.

**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**

Rain tapped against the metal ceiling above him.

Akira’s eyes opened slowly.

A dark room.  
Walls of black steel.  
Cold air brushing against his skin.

He looked down.

A metal floor.  
A metal chair.  
Metal cuffs locking his wrists and ankles in place.

He tried shifting.

“…The hell?”

The restraints didn’t budge.

Before he could gather his thoughts—

**CREAK…**

A heavy metal door slid open.

Akira tensed.  
Instinct took over.  
He forced himself upright, chair and all—  
the legs scraping loudly against the floor as he stood, fully bound.

A silhouette stepped through the doorway.

A man.

“Who are you?” Akira snapped, voice sharper than he expected.

The man muttered something under his breath, stepping into the dull overhead light.

He wore a black bodysuit.  
Short dark-purple hair.  
Slender build.  
Tinted glasses.  
And—unexpectedly—a cane in his hand.

He lifted the cane theatrically.

“**Welcome, Hellspawn.**”

He slicked his hair back with a single slow sweep of his hand, closing his eyes in a dramatic flourish.

He held the pose.

Hand in hair.  
Head tilted slightly.  
Smirk glued to his face.

He didn’t move.

Five seconds passed.  
Then ten.  
Then twenty.

He stayed frozen—  
like a statue built solely to perform the world’s slowest, most over-the-top hair slick.

Akira stared.

The air grew painfully awkward.

Then—

A tiny voice squeaked from behind him.

“U-um… sir…?”

The man didn’t break the pose.

Still hand in hair.  
Still eyes closed.  
Still smirking with unearned confidence.

The voice trembled again.

“…S-sir…?”

A young girl stepped into the light.

Fourteen at most.  
A full black suit far too big for her—sleeves over her hands, pant legs bunching around her shoes.

Brown hair tied in a ponytail, though strands escaped from her shaking.

Round glasses fogged slightly from nervous breathing.

Her entire posture screamed:  
*timid, terrified, deeply regretting being hired.*

She clutched a clipboard like it was a lifeline.

“…S-sir— um— h-he’s… he’s just a normal guy…”

The man’s smirk twitched.

He stayed in the pose for one more stubborn second.

Then his eyes snapped open.

“…What?”

His hand dropped from his hair.

The aura—  
the coolness—  
the entire twenty-second pose—

**collapsed instantly.**

“**WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE’S JUST A NORMAL GUY?!**”

His voice cracked as he spun around, nearly stumbling after committing too hard to his own theatrics.

The girl flinched so violently her glasses slid down her nose.

“H-h-he doesn’t match any Hellspawn readings!  
N-no demonic signatures!  
N-no anomalies at all!  
H-he’s j-just… a civilian!”

The man grabbed his head with both hands.

“WE SET UP A PORTAL FOR THIS!  
WE— I— DID A TWENTY-SECOND HAIR POSE—  
AND HE’S JUST SOME RANDOM GUY?!”

“Oh crap… oh crap… oh crap…”  
the girl whispered, shaking like a terrified NPC.

Silence followed.

Thick.  
Awkward.  
Suffocating.

Akira didn’t speak.

He didn’t need to.

The humiliation filling the room was enough to silence even him.

Finally, he drew in a breath.

“S-so uh… are you guys like what the men in blac—”

His sentence died halfway through.

His throat locked.  
His lungs seized.  
A rough cough tore out of him.

Before he could understand—

The world tilted.

Dust burst around him as his body hit the floor, cheek pressed to cold metal.

He blinked, vision spinning, dizziness crushing him.

He had been standing seconds ago.

“…huh…?”

Then—

A voice colder than steel:

**“I don’t recall giving you permission to speak.”**

Akira froze.

The purple-haired man stepped closer, spinning his cane.  
Metal clicked—  
shifted—  
transformed—

**into a blade.**

A long, sharp point extended toward Akira’s face.

Akira’s eyes widened.  
His breath hitched.  
Every muscle tensed.

The air shifted into something deadly.

“Wait—WAIT! You can’t just kill him, sir!”

The young girl darted forward.

Her glasses shook.  
Her ponytail trembled.  
Her clipboard rattled as she shielded Akira with her tiny frame.

“He’s a civilian! A c-civilian!  
H-he’s not a threat!”

The man didn’t lower the blade.

He only exhaled slowly—humiliation still burning beneath his tinted lenses.

“…Do not test me.”

The girl flinched, but stood her ground.

Akira lay frozen.

Dizzy.  
Disoriented.  
Terrified.

Blood dripped from his nose.

A thin line.

Warm.  
Wrong.

His nose tingled—  
a strange, delayed sensation—  
and then the memory struck him:

He hadn’t collapsed.

He had been **kicked in the face** the moment he spoke.

His hands clenched, ropes digging into his wrists.

A single thought echoed through him:

**I’m in danger.**

His vision blurred…  
darkened…  
faded…

as fear swallowed him whole.

A sound cut through the silence.

**Sllllrp.**

The unmistakable noise of someone sucking the last bit of juice through a straw.

Akira forced his blurry eyes open.

A figure walked into the room.

A woman.

Black suit.  
Long strides.  
Casual posture—far too casual for a torture chamber.

Akira’s vision swayed, but he managed to mutter under his breath:

“…red hair…?”

She was drinking from a small carton of **apple juice**, the straw still between her lips as she stopped in front of him.

She didn’t bother looking down at him first.

She just inhaled through the straw—  
**slrp**—  
and spoke with absolute confidence:

“Are you ready to answer our questions, Hellspawn?”

Silence.

No one responded.

Not the girl.  
Not the purple-haired man.  
Not even Akira, half-unconscious on the floor.

“…um… Miss Ren,”  
the little girl whispered, tugging lightly at the woman’s sleeve.

Ren leaned down as the girl whispered into her ear.

The room held its breath.

**Silence.**

Ren nodded once.

“I see.”

She nodded again.

“I see.”

She nodded a third time.

Still sipping her juice.

Silence stretched.

Then—

Ren’s expression snapped.  
Her voice boomed, shaking the room:

**“WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE’S JUST A NORMAL GUY?!”**

Her shout echoed off the metal walls with enough force to knock dust loose from the ceiling.

The girl flinched.  
The purple-haired man winced like he’d been stabbed in the pride.

Akira?

He could only lie there, dizzy and bleeding slightly, thinking:

*…who ARE these people?*

“This is all your fault, Ren! You’re the one who told us he was clearly part of them!”  
the purple-haired man shouted.

Ren shot back instantly:

“The hell you mean, dumbass?! *You* were the one monitoring him!”

Their arguing rose, sharp and messy.

The young girl clamped her hands over her ears.

Akira, still on the floor, muttered:

“…apart of them…?”

Then everything blurred.

The room.  
The shouting.  
The lights.

His thoughts collapsed into raw sensations.

**Inner thoughts:**

*it hurts.*  
*it hurts.*  
*it burns.*  
*why does it burn so much…?*  
*hey.*  
*where am I…?*  
*why does it—*  
*hey.*  
*…that’s not my voice…?*  
*hey…?*

A shadow moved in front of him.

His mind flickered.

Then—

**“HEY.”**

Loud.  
Sharp.  
Real.

Akira’s eyes snapped open.

Ren was crouched in front of him, one hand gripping his chin, forcing him to look up.

Her voice…  
was the *hey* he’d been hearing.

“Stay awake,” she said, annoyance dripping from every word.  
“I wasn’t done talking to you.”

The burning inside him surged again.

Ren slammed her fingers against the holographic keyboard.

**BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.**

Multiple screens flickered into existence around Akira — security feeds, files, blurry images of him walking into the library.

The purple-haired man jabbed his finger at one screen.

“**THERE! SEE?!**”

The image showed Akira…

…holding a book.

Ren exploded.

“WHO,” she shouted,  
“**WALKS INTO A GOVERNMENT-SEALED LIBRARY WITH FIFTY THOUSAND BOOKS—**  
**AND PICKS UP** ***THE*** **MOST SACRED, RESTRICTED, HEAVILY GUARDED ONE—**  
**READS FOUR PAGES—**  
**AND JUST LEAVES?!**”

Her voice cracked the air.

“No human does that in a library,”  
the purple-haired man muttered, genuinely shaken.

Akira stared.

Shock. Confusion. Fury.

“…Huh?” he exhaled.

Then louder —

“WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN?!  
YOU KIDNAPPED ME OVER— WHAT?!  
OVER READING A BOOK FOR FOUR SECONDS?!”

His voice echoed around the steel walls.

The young girl covered her ears, shrinking under the tension.

Then—  
softly:

“Um… Mister Akira…?”

Akira turned, still panting.

She stepped forward.

Still trembling.  
Still timid.  
Still clutching her clipboard.

But her voice—

It shifted.

Not scared.  
Not stuttering.

Just… resigned.

“So here’s what’s going to happen,” she said quietly.

Then she corrected herself.

“No…  
I’m sorry.”  
Her eyes lowered.  
“Here is what **already happened**.”

Akira froze.

Ren and the purple-haired man stiffened—  
not daring to interrupt her.

The girl inhaled shakily.

“You entered a government-protected library…”  
Her voice was small.  
Fragile.  
Accurate in a way that chilled the room.

“…that is run by world leaders.”

Akira blinked.

“You had a bomb with you.”

His breath caught.

“You were a mule in a terrorist operation.”

His pulse spiked.

“They bribed you.”

His heart dropped.

“Police officers responded.  
There was a shootout between law enforcement and the terrorists.”

Ren looked away.  
The purple-haired man swallowed hard.

The girl forced the last words out, barely a whisper:

“And then…  
you detonated the bomb.”

Silence swallowed the room whole.

She continued:

“Hundreds died.”  
Her voice cracked.  
“Including you.”

Akira’s knees weakened despite being tied to the chair.

“You understand… right?” she whispered.

Ren and the purple-haired man stared at the floor.

Avoiding Akira’s eyes.  
Avoiding the truth they forced on him.

Akira’s voice broke.

“…what…?”

His chest tightened.

“What…?”

The burning inside him spread like fire under his skin.

“**WHAT?**”

“**Operation Re:Birth.**”

Ren muttered it so quietly it barely existed.

The room fell dead silent.

**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**

Akira’s sweat hit the metal floor in slow, trembling drops.

His breathing turned thin.  
Fragile.  
Shallow.

Without warning—

**SNAP.**

The purple-haired man flicked his cane.  
The blade folded back in a smooth, unnatural motion—  
and with a single, effortless sweep—

**the ropes binding Akira split apart.**

He didn’t even *feel* the moment they loosened.

One second bound.  
The next—

**empty.**

His arms dropped limply to his sides.  
His legs shook under him.

He wasn’t free.  
He wasn’t safe.

He was just… **untied.**

The young girl closed her eyes.

A long inhale.  
A trembling exhale.

Her voice came out like something delicate breaking:

“**The aftermath was… horrible.**”

Akira’s chest tightened.

“Your boss couldn’t believe you would do such a thing.”

His heart stuttered.

“Your girlfriend was extremely upset.  
She said you were a kind soul… yet this world is full of liars.”

Her lips quivered.

“I can’t believe you’d let her cry so much… what a horrible thing to do.”

Her hand pressed to her chest,  
her eyes glued to the floor,  
refusing to look at him —  
not out of anger,

but out of **shame on his behalf.**

Akira’s breath faltered.

His pulse hammered.

“Your family… see you as a failure now.”

Ren and the purple-haired man both turned their heads away.

Cowards.

The girl continued, voice cracking:

“Your university lecturers and friends couldn’t believe it.”

Her tiny fingers curled around the clipboard.

“They said you were smart.  
Wise.  
Trusted.  
Loved.”

**Silence.**

The kind of silence that makes the world feel smaller.  
Heavier.  
Colder.

Then—

She looked up.

Her eyes glistened with guilt and fear.

“Do you understand?”

It wasn’t a question.

It was a verdict.

Akira’s throat locked.

He didn’t answer.

He *couldn’t.*

Because the truth had already sunk its nails into him:

**The world believed he died a monster.**  
**A terrorist.**  
**A fraud.**  
**A disgrace.**

And these people—

**had rewritten his existence.**

The purple-haired man leaned forward, whispering like something sacred and forbidden:

“**Re:Birth Operation… Glass and Gloss.**”

The words slid under Akira’s skin like poison.

His body trembled violently.

His breath shortened.

“…what the hell is going on…”

The words slipped out of him like a dying thought.

He looked down at his right hand—

It was shaking uncontrollably,  
fingers twitching,  
palm spasming like it didn’t belong to him anymore.

He tried to clench it.

He couldn’t.

His hand was no longer listening.

His body was no longer *his.*

Ren sighed.

A heavy, exhausted breath —  
like someone who had finally reached a checkpoint she never wanted to.

“…Alright. I guess it’s time.”

Akira stumbled backward, nearly tripping over his own feet.

“T-Time for what?!”

His voice cracked.

He was shaking uncontrollably.

drip.

He looked at his hand.

The tiny paper cut from earlier —  
the stupid little thing he joked about dying from —  
was still bleeding.

Except now…  
the wound pulsed.

The blood **gushed** a little more each second.

drip.

His brown hair swayed slightly —  
even though there was no wind in the metal room.

His eyes widened.

And then —

The door behind Ren slid open.

More people walked in.

And more.

And more.

Whispers.  
Muttering.  
Breaths that didn’t belong to any face he recognized.

Their voices blended together into a low, nauseating drone.

Were there ten?

Twenty?

Thirty?

Forty?

The young girl was gone.  
The purple-haired man was gone.  
Ren was gone.

Everyone he’d met in this nightmare had vanished.

Replaced by a crowd of silhouettes that filled every inch of the room.

Akira’s voice trembled as he shouted:

“WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!”

Silence.

Then—

The entire crowd bowed their heads.

And in perfect unison,

they whispered:

**“Re:Birth — Project Glass and Gloss.”**

Akira blinked—

And the world snapped.





Birds chirped.

A dog barked somewhere.

Warm sunlight pressed onto his skin.

He turned—

People were walking their dogs.

Kids were laughing.

A couple held hands.

Coffee shops buzzed with life.

The clatter of mugs.

The smell of pastries.

Humanity.

He was standing on a familiar street, his shoes scraping concrete as he stumbled to his knees.

His blue jeans tore slightly.

His breath shook violently as he covered his mouth —  
he was going to puke.

“H-Huh…? What…?”

His brain couldn’t process it.

A second ago he was in a steel room.

Now…

Now he was—

Alive?

Free?

Safe?

No.

No, something was wrong.

Very wrong.

Because—

SIRENS.

SIRENS.

SIRENS.

Not one.

Not two.

Dozens.

Akira’s head snapped up as blue and red lights exploded across the street.

Police cars.  
Ambulances.  
Fire trucks.

Dozens of them.

Racing past him.

Their sirens ripped through the peaceful afternoon like knives.

Akira slowly stood, stumbling, staring down the road as chaos surged toward him.

It was still bright outside.

Warm.  
Sunny.  
Alive.

No rain.

No metal walls.

Just—

Pure confusion.

And the feeling —  
burning in his chest and crawling up his spine —  
that something was horribly, irrevocably wrong.

He didn’t know why.

But he followed.

Something in his chest — instinct, dread, gravity — pulled him toward the sirens.

People were already running, gathering, whispering.

And then Akira saw it.

His heart dropped into a black void.

The library he had just been in—

**—was engulfed in flames.**

Not damaged.

Not partially burned.

Destroyed.

The entire structure had collapsed into a mountain of scorched rubble.  
Flames clawed at the sky.  
Black smoke twisted upward like a funeral banner.

Wood crackled.  
Glass shattered.  
Metal warped in the heat.

Akira’s breath vanished.

People stood in clusters, watching, murmuring.

“Bastard…”  
a teenage boy spat.

“Pure filth,”  
an old man muttered with shaking hands.

“That asshole was nothing more than a good-for-nothing terrorist,”  
growled another man.

Akira’s ears rang.

“What…?”

“I heard he was a good man, though…”  
a woman added quietly.

But no one listened to her.

Police pushed civilians back, forming a barrier.  
Detectives stepped through the smoke, holding papers and photographs.

Akira walked forward, eyes empty, feet moving without permission.

A detective raised a sketch above the crowd.

“Has anyone ever seen this man?” he called out.

Akira’s world stopped.

The drawing—

It was him.

A perfect sketch of his face.

His hairstyle.  
His clothes.  
His expression.

Then the detective flipped the page.

A photograph.

Akira holding a bomb inside the library.

His vision fractured.

His knees buckled.

He fell to the ground, palms hitting the pavement.

“Huh…”  
the sound escaped him, barely a breath.

He stared at his hands.

The place where the paper cut should’ve been—

**Gone.**

His nose—  
no longer burning, no trace of blood.

Everything from the metal room—  
the kick, the ropes, the blade—

**undone.**

“What…” he whispered.

“What the hell is Re:Birth…?”

A hand touched his shoulder.

“You alright, pal?”  
a man asked gently.

Another man leaned in.  
“Don’t worry. We’ll find that monster for sure.”

They smiled at him.

Like he was just another civilian.

Like they had never seen his face on the drawing.

Like he wasn’t the man the entire crowd was cursing moments ago.

Akira’s throat tightened.

They didn’t recognise him.

They couldn’t.

Operation Re:Birth erased him.

Replaced him.

Killed him.

And now—

**he was a ghost inside his own life.**

His blade severed armies.  
His power ended wars.

Yet he was never fully evil.  
He protected humanity—  
and in the same breath,  
separated humans and demons forever.

The clash between him and his brothers shook creation itself.  
No being could witness those battles and remain unmoved.  
They were jaw-dropping.  
Unforgettable.

The wars lasted thousands of years.  
Countless lives were lost.  
Not a single soul would ever forget his na—

“**Was this written by a child?**”

Akira squinted at the page.

“**How boring.**”

He snapped the book shut with a flick.

**TICK.**

“Ah— crap.”

A tiny slice appeared on his finger.  
He blew on it instinctively, holding it up.

He glanced around.

The librarian looked up at him for half a second—  
not in concern, not in suspicion—  
just in the universal way someone looks at *noise*.

She went right back to typing.  
Uninterested.  
Unbothered.  
Absolutely done with life.

Akira forced a laugh.

“Guess I’m gonna die from this papercut, huh?”

She didn’t even blink.

He muttered:

“…tough crowd.”

Silence.





**RING.**  
**RING.**  
**RING.**

Akira sighed and picked up his phone.

“…Hello.”

His posture straightened.  
His eyes sharpened.  
The casual warmth vanished.

A man’s voice blared through the speaker:

**“AKIRA!**  
**Listen, can you come in early today?**  
**Rimi just up and quit—didn’t even give notice.**  
**There’s a mountain of dishes and we’re swamped!”**

Akira exhaled heavily.

“…right.”

He blinked.

He put the book back on the shelf, yawning as he walked out of the aisle.

He pushed the library doors open.

Sunlight spilled across his face.

“…Nice,” he murmured, closing his eyes as he embraced the warmth.

Then he opened them.

And froze.

A swirling distortion hung in the air directly in front of him.

Like a tear in space.  
Like a glitch in reality.

*…Portal?*  
he thought.

Before his brain could even process the word—

**tap.**

A foot nudged the middle of his back.

Light.  
Lazy.  
Almost bored.

Yet somehow strong enough to knock him off his feet.

“H-HUH—?!”

His balance vanished.  
He pitched forward into the distortion.

Instinctively, he twisted mid-fall to see who touched him.

There—  
on the library steps—  
stood a woman.

She wore a full black bodysuit, long-sleeved and slightly baggy around the joints.  
Her dark red hair rested over one shoulder.  
Her eyes were hidden behind tinted black glasses.

Her leg hovered just slightly off the ground—  
the casual follow-through of someone who had just nudged a door closed…  
except the “door” was him.

No expression.  
No tension.  
No hostility.

Just a bored professional doing her job.

Akira’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“**The HELL—?!**”

The portal swallowed him whole before he could finish the sentence.

Light bent.  
Sound warped.  
Her figure vanished as he fell into the unknown.

**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**

Rain tapped against the metal ceiling above him.

Akira’s eyes opened slowly.

A dark room.  
Walls of black steel.  
Cold air brushing against his skin.

He looked down.

A metal floor.  
A metal chair.  
Metal cuffs locking his wrists and ankles in place.

He tried shifting.

“…The hell?”

The restraints didn’t budge.

Before he could gather his thoughts—

**CREAK…**

A heavy metal door slid open.

Akira tensed.  
Instinct took over.  
He forced himself upright, chair and all—  
the legs scraping loudly against the floor as he stood, fully bound.

A silhouette stepped through the doorway.

A man.

“Who are you?” Akira snapped, voice sharper than he expected.

The man muttered something under his breath, stepping into the dull overhead light.

He wore a black bodysuit.  
Short dark-purple hair.  
Slender build.  
Tinted glasses.  
And—unexpectedly—a cane in his hand.

He lifted the cane theatrically.

“**Welcome, Hellspawn.**”

He slicked his hair back with a single slow sweep of his hand, closing his eyes in a dramatic flourish.

He held the pose.

Hand in hair.  
Head tilted slightly.  
Smirk glued to his face.

He didn’t move.

Five seconds passed.  
Then ten.  
Then twenty.

He stayed frozen—  
like a statue built solely to perform the world’s slowest, most over-the-top hair slick.

Akira stared.

The air grew painfully awkward.

Then—

A tiny voice squeaked from behind him.

“U-um… sir…?”

The man didn’t break the pose.

Still hand in hair.  
Still eyes closed.  
Still smirking with unearned confidence.

The voice trembled again.

“…S-sir…?”

A young girl stepped into the light.

Fourteen at most.  
A full black suit far too big for her—sleeves over her hands, pant legs bunching around her shoes.

Brown hair tied in a ponytail, though strands escaped from her shaking.

Round glasses fogged slightly from nervous breathing.

Her entire posture screamed:  
*timid, terrified, deeply regretting being hired.*

She clutched a clipboard like it was a lifeline.

“…S-sir— um— h-he’s… he’s just a normal guy…”

The man’s smirk twitched.

He stayed in the pose for one more stubborn second.

Then his eyes snapped open.

“…What?”

His hand dropped from his hair.

The aura—  
the coolness—  
the entire twenty-second pose—

**collapsed instantly.**

“**WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE’S JUST A NORMAL GUY?!**”

His voice cracked as he spun around, nearly stumbling after committing too hard to his own theatrics.

The girl flinched so violently her glasses slid down her nose.

“H-h-he doesn’t match any Hellspawn readings!  
N-no demonic signatures!  
N-no anomalies at all!  
H-he’s j-just… a civilian!”

The man grabbed his head with both hands.

“WE SET UP A PORTAL FOR THIS!  
WE— I— DID A TWENTY-SECOND HAIR POSE—  
AND HE’S JUST SOME RANDOM GUY?!”

“Oh crap… oh crap… oh crap…”  
the girl whispered, shaking like a terrified NPC.

Silence followed.

Thick.  
Awkward.  
Suffocating.

Akira didn’t speak.

He didn’t need to.

The humiliation filling the room was enough to silence even him.

Finally, he drew in a breath.

“S-so uh… are you guys like what the men in blac—”

His sentence died halfway through.

His throat locked.  
His lungs seized.  
A rough cough tore out of him.

Before he could understand—

The world tilted.

Dust burst around him as his body hit the floor, cheek pressed to cold metal.

He blinked, vision spinning, dizziness crushing him.

He had been standing seconds ago.

“…huh…?”

Then—

A voice colder than steel:

**“I don’t recall giving you permission to speak.”**

Akira froze.

The purple-haired man stepped closer, spinning his cane.  
Metal clicked—  
shifted—  
transformed—

**into a blade.**

A long, sharp point extended toward Akira’s face.

Akira’s eyes widened.  
His breath hitched.  
Every muscle tensed.

The air shifted into something deadly.

“Wait—WAIT! You can’t just kill him, sir!”

The young girl darted forward.

Her glasses shook.  
Her ponytail trembled.  
Her clipboard rattled as she shielded Akira with her tiny frame.

“He’s a civilian! A c-civilian!  
H-he’s not a threat!”

The man didn’t lower the blade.

He only exhaled slowly—humiliation still burning beneath his tinted lenses.

“…Do not test me.”

The girl flinched, but stood her ground.

Akira lay frozen.

Dizzy.  
Disoriented.  
Terrified.

Blood dripped from his nose.

A thin line.

Warm.  
Wrong.

His nose tingled—  
a strange, delayed sensation—  
and then the memory struck him:

He hadn’t collapsed.

He had been **kicked in the face** the moment he spoke.

His hands clenched, ropes digging into his wrists.

A single thought echoed through him:

**I’m in danger.**

His vision blurred…  
darkened…  
faded…

as fear swallowed him whole.

A sound cut through the silence.

**Sllllrp.**

The unmistakable noise of someone sucking the last bit of juice through a straw.

Akira forced his blurry eyes open.

A figure walked into the room.

A woman.

Black suit.  
Long strides.  
Casual posture—far too casual for a torture chamber.

Akira’s vision swayed, but he managed to mutter under his breath:

“…red hair…?”

She was drinking from a small carton of **apple juice**, the straw still between her lips as she stopped in front of him.

She didn’t bother looking down at him first.

She just inhaled through the straw—  
**slrp**—  
and spoke with absolute confidence:

“Are you ready to answer our questions, Hellspawn?”

Silence.

No one responded.

Not the girl.  
Not the purple-haired man.  
Not even Akira, half-unconscious on the floor.

“…um… Miss Ren,”  
the little girl whispered, tugging lightly at the woman’s sleeve.

Ren leaned down as the girl whispered into her ear.

The room held its breath.

**Silence.**

Ren nodded once.

“I see.”

She nodded again.

“I see.”

She nodded a third time.

Still sipping her juice.

Silence stretched.

Then—

Ren’s expression snapped.  
Her voice boomed, shaking the room:

**“WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE’S JUST A NORMAL GUY?!”**

Her shout echoed off the metal walls with enough force to knock dust loose from the ceiling.

The girl flinched.  
The purple-haired man winced like he’d been stabbed in the pride.

Akira?

He could only lie there, dizzy and bleeding slightly, thinking:

*…who ARE these people?*

“This is all your fault, Ren! You’re the one who told us he was clearly part of them!”  
the purple-haired man shouted.

Ren shot back instantly:

“The hell you mean, dumbass?! *You* were the one monitoring him!”

Their arguing rose, sharp and messy.

The young girl clamped her hands over her ears.

Akira, still on the floor, muttered:

“…apart of them…?”

Then everything blurred.

The room.  
The shouting.  
The lights.

His thoughts collapsed into raw sensations.

**Inner thoughts:**

*it hurts.*  
*it hurts.*  
*it burns.*  
*why does it burn so much…?*  
*hey.*  
*where am I…?*  
*why does it—*  
*hey.*  
*…that’s not my voice…?*  
*hey…?*

A shadow moved in front of him.

His mind flickered.

Then—

**“HEY.”**

Loud.  
Sharp.  
Real.

Akira’s eyes snapped open.

Ren was crouched in front of him, one hand gripping his chin, forcing him to look up.

Her voice…  
was the *hey* he’d been hearing.

“Stay awake,” she said, annoyance dripping from every word.  
“I wasn’t done talking to you.”

The burning inside him surged again.

Ren slammed her fingers against the holographic keyboard.

**BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.**

Multiple screens flickered into existence around Akira — security feeds, files, blurry images of him walking into the library.

The purple-haired man jabbed his finger at one screen.

“**THERE! SEE?!**”

The image showed Akira…

…holding a book.

Ren exploded.

“WHO,” she shouted,  
“**WALKS INTO A GOVERNMENT-SEALED LIBRARY WITH FIFTY THOUSAND BOOKS—**  
**AND PICKS UP** ***THE*** **MOST SACRED, RESTRICTED, HEAVILY GUARDED ONE—**  
**READS FOUR PAGES—**  
**AND JUST LEAVES?!**”

Her voice cracked the air.

“No human does that in a library,”  
the purple-haired man muttered, genuinely shaken.

Akira stared.

Shock. Confusion. Fury.

“…Huh?” he exhaled.

Then louder —

“WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN?!  
YOU KIDNAPPED ME OVER— WHAT?!  
OVER READING A BOOK FOR FOUR SECONDS?!”

His voice echoed around the steel walls.

The young girl covered her ears, shrinking under the tension.

Then—  
softly:

“Um… Mister Akira…?”

Akira turned, still panting.

She stepped forward.

Still trembling.  
Still timid.  
Still clutching her clipboard.

But her voice—

It shifted.

Not scared.  
Not stuttering.

Just… resigned.

“So here’s what’s going to happen,” she said quietly.

Then she corrected herself.

“No…  
I’m sorry.”  
Her eyes lowered.  
“Here is what **already happened**.”

Akira froze.

Ren and the purple-haired man stiffened—  
not daring to interrupt her.

The girl inhaled shakily.

“You entered a government-protected library…”  
Her voice was small.  
Fragile.  
Accurate in a way that chilled the room.

“…that is run by world leaders.”

Akira blinked.

“You had a bomb with you.”

His breath caught.

“You were a mule in a terrorist operation.”

His pulse spiked.

“They bribed you.”

His heart dropped.

“Police officers responded.  
There was a shootout between law enforcement and the terrorists.”

Ren looked away.  
The purple-haired man swallowed hard.

The girl forced the last words out, barely a whisper:

“And then…  
you detonated the bomb.”

Silence swallowed the room whole.

She continued:

“Hundreds died.”  
Her voice cracked.  
“Including you.”

Akira’s knees weakened despite being tied to the chair.

“You understand… right?” she whispered.

Ren and the purple-haired man stared at the floor.

Avoiding Akira’s eyes.  
Avoiding the truth they forced on him.

Akira’s voice broke.

“…what…?”

His chest tightened.

“What…?”

The burning inside him spread like fire under his skin.

“**WHAT?**”

“**Operation Re:Birth.**”

Ren muttered it so quietly it barely existed.

The room fell dead silent.

**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**

Akira’s sweat hit the metal floor in slow, trembling drops.

His breathing turned thin.  
Fragile.  
Shallow.

Without warning—

**SNAP.**

The purple-haired man flicked his cane.  
The blade folded back in a smooth, unnatural motion—  
and with a single, effortless sweep—

**the ropes binding Akira split apart.**

He didn’t even *feel* the moment they loosened.

One second bound.  
The next—

**empty.**

His arms dropped limply to his sides.  
His legs shook under him.

He wasn’t free.  
He wasn’t safe.

He was just… **untied.**

The young girl closed her eyes.

A long inhale.  
A trembling exhale.

Her voice came out like something delicate breaking:

“**The aftermath was… horrible.**”

Akira’s chest tightened.

“Your boss couldn’t believe you would do such a thing.”

His heart stuttered.

“Your girlfriend was extremely upset.  
She said you were a kind soul… yet this world is full of liars.”

Her lips quivered.

“I can’t believe you’d let her cry so much… what a horrible thing to do.”

Her hand pressed to her chest,  
her eyes glued to the floor,  
refusing to look at him —  
not out of anger,

but out of **shame on his behalf.**

Akira’s breath faltered.

His pulse hammered.

“Your family… see you as a failure now.”

Ren and the purple-haired man both turned their heads away.

Cowards.

The girl continued, voice cracking:

“Your university lecturers and friends couldn’t believe it.”

Her tiny fingers curled around the clipboard.

“They said you were smart.  
Wise.  
Trusted.  
Loved.”

**Silence.**

The kind of silence that makes the world feel smaller.  
Heavier.  
Colder.

Then—

She looked up.

Her eyes glistened with guilt and fear.

“Do you understand?”

It wasn’t a question.

It was a verdict.

Akira’s throat locked.

He didn’t answer.

He *couldn’t.*

Because the truth had already sunk its nails into him:

**The world believed he died a monster.**  
**A terrorist.**  
**A fraud.**  
**A disgrace.**

And these people—

**had rewritten his existence.**

The purple-haired man leaned forward, whispering like something sacred and forbidden:

“**Re:Birth Operation… Glass and Gloss.**”

The words slid under Akira’s skin like poison.

His body trembled violently.

His breath shortened.

“…what the hell is going on…”

The words slipped out of him like a dying thought.

He looked down at his right hand—

It was shaking uncontrollably,  
fingers twitching,  
palm spasming like it didn’t belong to him anymore.

He tried to clench it.

He couldn’t.

His hand was no longer listening.

His body was no longer *his.*

Ren sighed.

A heavy, exhausted breath —  
like someone who had finally reached a checkpoint she never wanted to.

“…Alright. I guess it’s time.”

Akira stumbled backward, nearly tripping over his own feet.

“T-Time for what?!”

His voice cracked.

He was shaking uncontrollably.

drip.

He looked at his hand.

The tiny paper cut from earlier —  
the stupid little thing he joked about dying from —  
was still bleeding.

Except now…  
the wound pulsed.

The blood **gushed** a little more each second.

drip.

His brown hair swayed slightly —  
even though there was no wind in the metal room.

His eyes widened.

And then —

The door behind Ren slid open.

More people walked in.

And more.

And more.

Whispers.  
Muttering.  
Breaths that didn’t belong to any face he recognized.

Their voices blended together into a low, nauseating drone.

Were there ten?

Twenty?

Thirty?

Forty?

The young girl was gone.  
The purple-haired man was gone.  
Ren was gone.

Everyone he’d met in this nightmare had vanished.

Replaced by a crowd of silhouettes that filled every inch of the room.

Over the course of my life, I've managed to avoid flying with an iron vigor: despite the many situations it reared its ugly head into. I would drive three days straight, with only power naps to get me by, if it meant I didn't have to fly there. A feat I’ve taken many times. This recent predicament left me very few options; which driving was not one. 

While eating at a Golden Corral my dad got a wishbone lodged in his windpipe. By the time they got it dislodged he was already a shade of violet and lacking oxygen in his brain. While stable now, he might not be for very long: leaving this state of urgency. And the prospect that, if I don't see him now, I may never again. Thus, my FOMO negated my fear of flying, and forced my hand into buying a ticket.

I trembled all the way through TSA, and the long walk to my gate: practically fossilized in my seat by the time my section was called to board. I whipped out my phone, my boarding pass illuminated on its greasy screen. I wasn't even sure how long I stood there trying to scan my pass; my shaky hands making the code impossible to read. The ramp operator took special notice of me when the barcode was read. She must've noticed my petrification. 

""We really appreciate you"". She said with an uncurated genuinity in her tone. 

""Uh..thanks. I appreciate you too"" 

I thought about the exchange down the entire ramp, was I weird or was she. Nobody could've expected her to say that. Nobody would've had a response prepared. Like a miscalculated: “You too.”, in response to a, “Enjoy the show.”, at a ticket booth. Hopefully my face would be lost in the mass of people she sees everyday. 

When I came face to face with the plane's door; I ground the line of passengers to a halt. My eyes were fixed to the gap between the ramp and plane. The sound of engines and wind so loud, through just half a foot of space. Already we were so high up. I could fall through the gap if I was 90lbs lighter: break my ankle on impact. I snapped back to reality, and knew it was socially unexceptable to stand here any longer. The groans of the other passengers grew ever clear, along with the act of a kid tugging on his mom's dress, asking why we were waiting. If that kid isn't afraid, I shouldn't be either. I had no choice but to pass through the Gate to Hell, and join the Army of the Damned. 

As I stepped over the gap it's as if my soul did slip out of me; straight through it: just a skid mark on the tarmac. My confidence was already ailing. 

Then the wheel on my suitcase got caught on the outside of the door. I started tugging and twisting; looking back to assess the problem only to be met with a dozen or so faces, watching hatefully. With a hardy yank my carry-on was freed, one less wheel, and a date with the dump when this trip was over. I couldn't even look the flight attendants in the eyes when I rounded the corner, and started down the aisle to my seat. 

When I made it to my row the three seats were empty. Which brought a slight sense of relief, as my seat, was in my middle. I thought maybe, I would get the chance to take an Advil PM, and sprawl out across the seats. I was clenched into my seat for only a few minutes, when my rowmate to my left arrived. 

He was a portly man: adorned with a Cannibal Corpse shirt, full tattoo sleeve, and skull sandals. Despite what I may have expected him to be like, he ended up being rather friendly: simply greeting me, and plopping into his seat. His smell became a bit hard to bear. It was like: a very masculine, mahogany forest cologne, with a dusting of baby powder. Under normal circumstances, I likely wouldn't have noticed; but my stomach already in knots, and my senses heightened; the scent was very nauseating.

The arrival of my rowmate to the right, nearly made me flip my lid. It was a child. Roughly six or seven, his mom pushed him to our row, and turned his head from his tablet to his seat. The man and I had to get up to make way for the kid; carefully stepping in the spaces between our bags. The kid paid no mind to our bags however, stepping on mine bag to get to his seat. His mom had only enough energy to scold him in a defeated exclamation. With the gifting of a, tablet she parted ways; squeezing her way back up the aisle; so many rows away; too far to call for help. 

The depth of the situation was becoming dire; like I’m 20 leagues under the sea and the pressure is about to blow in the hall. The kid started watching a video of a man, with a painfully obnoxious voice, playing some children's game. It became quickly evident that the kid, did not have headphones; and I would have to listen to his videos until the tablet died. Who knows what torture would come after the tablet died. 

The Captain eventually introduced himself, and gave his words of reassurance that, despite the six hour flight ahead of us, there will be no problems along the way. Then came the safety demonstration from the flight attendants; the display was sickening. They tried to be humorous, to relieve tension, or amuse us: I’m not sure but it didn’t work. Just a stark reminder that a life jacket and breathing mask, doesn’t fare well against high altitude combustion. Nor would it be helpful if I was flung from the plane. It's rock from start to finish; when I meet the ground at mach 10 speeds, the life jacket would be an orange lump in a red puddle. 

Takeoff was horrible. My fingers bored wedges into the ends of the arm rests; latched to them like I was riding a roller coaster. The pressure in my ears sunk into a faint ring, until they popped thirty minutes into the flight. By that time, the man in the aisle seat was already knocked out. As it turns out, he had horrible sleep apnea. His head would be flopped back, mouth wide open, really letting his snore travel through the cabin. Sometimes he would choke, his tongue falling back into his throat, forcing him to burst awake when his body realized he was dying. The first time this happened, his arm flung out and hit me: I let out a yelp that disturbed everyone around us further. He apologized, but before he seemed to finish his sentence, he was back asleep: head slumped over his shoulder, facing me. I tried to push it away with my pointer finger, but it always rolled its way back; eventually slumping onto my shoulder, that's when I really pushed him away. The second time he choked himself awake, a flight attendant had just rolled the cart through, having to lift his head out of the aisle to get past him. The sample of pepsi she had given me, made its way onto me when the man knocked it out of my hands. 

""I'm so sorry man, I didn't mean to"". The man said as I used my sleeve to pat dribblets of pepsi off my face. He was slumped over snoring again immediately after. 

The kid was still glued to his tablet; his neck craned over, as it sat in his lap. The poor kid was doomed to have a turtles neck when he reached his golden years: shoulders all slouched, connected to the collar with a protruding spiny bump. The dreaded moment arrived too soon, his tablet died; he wasted no time to ask for his mom. Tugging on my sleeve, seeing if I knew where she was. I told him she was in front of us, but it must not have registered, as he continued to ask. I didn't know what to do, I thought I could just pick him up and set him in the aisle, let him look for her, but then I would be holding a stranger's kid. I looked around frantically, evaluating my options. The only thing I could think of was distracting him with the window. I slid up the window covering so he could see outside. It was haunting. No clouds in sight to obscure the view. An incomprehensible height, so far from the natural world, where man is meant to be. It was a bad distraction as well, the view entertained him for a few minutes before realizing it was more fun to open and close the cover. The slow flashing of the bright sky, coupled with a glimpse into the end with every opening was maddening.

 Maybe a compassionate stranger complained, or the flight attendant just took notice, but she approached me with a proposal. She asked if I would like to be upgraded to first class to give my seat to the boy's mother. I naturally accepted. 

The walk to first class was awkward, shaking the pinprick numbness in my legs, and trying desperately not to rub my tailbone. What I couldn’t shake was the knowledge that beneath my feet was nothing but air. Nothing but a shear drop outside of this tin can. 

Through the curtain to first class was a much prettier scene. Individual cubbies, their exterior trimmed with rippled aluminum cladding. Each cubby privatized with curtains of their own: beautiful blue velvet, with gold fringed borders. One of the curtains was open; exposing a man in a formal suit, his tie undone, and buttons popped. Stuffed to the brim and comatosed, after having gorged himself on a roasted bird. It was 

quiet and elegant up here, not a child's crying to be heard. 

Where I was going; however, stood out from these booths. Stood out in the way that it blended in: there wasn’t a curtain to identify it; there wasn’t much of a door either. The flight attendant slid a card down a thin seam that, if you were looking for it, could be seen running from floor to ceiling. Grabbing onto the outer ridge and moving it leftwards, the wall folded in on itself, squeezing against the wall like a collapsable fan. She moved out of the way and presented the room with a show of her hand: a sweet lavender smell rushed out of the doorway, trying desperately to fill the first class’s, scentless vacuum. I slowly pressed in, careful not to disturb the sanctuary's atmosphere.

“Make yourself comfortable, it’s all yours.” She slid the door closed behind me and the room worked to replenish its aroma. 

Contrary to the minimalist aluminum that sheathed the plane inside and out, the interior of this room was wooden. Slat panels with acoustic foam underneath: the only light coming from red strips where the plane's cylindrical body requires the wall to slope inwards. The reminder that I was, in fact, on a plane, caused my stomach to sink; an unexpected blow after a period of tranquility. My momentary comfort only ensured the impact hurt worse when I fell from my pedestal. The room fought to draw me back in: it whispered classical music into my ears from an unseen source. 

In the center of the room was a round, solo dining table; stained dark and well polished: a napkin folded into the shape of a bird sat as the centerpiece. The accompanying seat looked to be a massage chair: leg nooks, a cubic brutalist body, and wrapped in maroon leather. Most of the wall behind it was dedicated to a water feature; one that had a thin waterfall that ran down a pane of tempered glass. Flowing down into a trough where large, flowered, lily pads jiggled around on top of the water, and red LEDs shown from below. 

I sunk into the chair, engulfed in its fluff, and surrounded by rubber pistons. Embedded into the armrest was a control panel, far more settings than on a mall chair; and luckily the absence of a cash slot. The buttons were not easy to discern however; all were different glowing colors, with white, seemingly random symbols on their faces. As I went through clicking the buttons, some connection could be gleaned between their symbol and function. The horizontal zigzag activated the massager, the turtle and rabbit buttons controlled speed, three wavy vertical lines were the heater, and the exclamation mark was to call in a flight attendant. I only realized the last one when a lady walked in, as I was whincing at the chair's, borderline painful massage feature. 

""Is the room to your liking?"" she asked. 

""Oh definitely, it's very nice. This is all very unexpected. I feel kinda outta place. Don’t get me wrong I appreciate it—it’s just, yeah, unexpected”

“You aren’t out of place at all, it was reserved for you."" She said with a consistent cadence, happy, but not enthusiastic; and a thin smile that wasn’t overbearingly consumer friendly, but definitely choreographed. She spoke very hushed, and matter-of-factly. 

""How's that? I bought the cheapest ticket I could."" 

""Well, it was selected at 'random'."" She said while using airquotes. 

""What does ‘random’ mean?"" 

""It’s determined by a computer, so as ‘random’ as they can be. There's still code and statistics involved, it’s not drawing sticks, but it does help us find you.” 

“Is there a reason for this?"" 

“The room or the ritual?” She asked with a lifted brow.

“The what now? A ritual?”

“I probably shouldn’t have called it that, the company likes to call it a ‘transaction’.” She said using air quotes again.

“Well what is the transaction!” My tone rising and becoming desperate.

“It’s just something that has to be done.” She said putting her hands up and backing up a couple of steps. ""A company policy, for safety reasons I think. I don’t know specifics, the captain usually gives the rundown by now; he can explain it better than me.” Stepping back further.

“You have to tell me more, you can’t say that then leave.”

“I-I’ll see if I can get the captain. Hang tight for a second.” She said with an increasingly shaky voice, before quickly spinning around, her Farrah Fawcett hair flinging over her shoulder as she dashed to the door. The sound of the door closing was followed by multiple and simultaneous locks moving into place.

I paced around the room waiting for the man to come: my mind was running through a rolodex of possible rituals. If she even meant it in the ghoulish, sacrifice a virgin way, she could’ve meant a tradition. I really needed a release, it felt like I was going to choke on my anxiety, so I figured it was as good a time as any to pick a drink off the wall. Across from the table was a shelved wall stocked with a large selection of alcohol. All were in ornate decanters, the names of the contents etched into a gold plaque in front of them. It's not much of an exaggeration to say the collection contained every intoxicating beverage. There were many high end liquors, easily worth..I don’t even know how much; then a few were filled with cheap, working man's beer.

As I poured myself a drink, three gentle knocks came from the door. After giving them the okay to come in, the captain slid open the door; gave me a chipper hello, and held out his hand to shake mine. I did not reciprocate. He had thick grey hair, from the looks of his mustache and curly mullet that poofed out from his tall, sturdy hat.

""What do you think about the room?"" He asked with a rancher’s twang in a slightly raspy voice.

“I want to know why I’m in here.”

“I apologize for this, transaction, being revealed to you in that way. Rosie is..well, she’s a bit ditsy I suppose. Lose her head if it weren’t screwed to her body kinda girl. I think it goes over better coming from my buttery smooth voice.” He said with a chuckle. 

“Can you cut to it, this is maddening.”

“Yes you’re right, enough beaten around the horse.” He sighed and rolled his eyes before locking them back to mine. Their blue color fading into a grey as well. “Look, every flight we are obligated to do this. It ain’t pretty, but the consequences are far worse. Okay?” Looking at me with those wide, piercing eyes.

“Yes?”

“Somebody, on every flight, in this case you, has to eat a baby. Alright?”

“No, not alright. What are you talking about?”

“Listen, I know how you feel; I was in your spot once; so has my co-pilot, and most of the flight attendants. A whole hell of a lot of folks have been in your shoes. None of us liked it. Well most of us didn’t like it, but that’s just how it is.”

“You’re full of shit. This can’t be true”

“Nuh uh, this is definitely real. This is how it’ll go, when you agree to our terms, the chef will…”

“I’m not listening to this, I’m shutting you down, la la la la” He grabbed my side, right under my ribs and squeezed tight. I whimpered and grabbed his hand to try to push it away but his grip was deadlocked. 

“Now would you cut that out, what I’m trying to tell you is important. I can’t stress enough how crucial this duty is. Are you willing to be civilized if I let you go?”

“Yes..” I said between blowing spastic breaths through my reddening cheeks.

“When you agree, the chef will come in, prepare the meal, and you will eat the whole thing, all before we land.”

“What happens if I don't?”

""The landing gear will malfunction, it’ll only partially deploy. When we touch down we will tip, port side, the left wing will touch ground, and break off bit by bit until it reaches the engine. An explosion will ensue that’ll set the blades free; where they will rip into the cabin, slaughtering everyone in its path. We will lose all footing and the nose will plunge into the ground. First class will crumple instantly; the body will be split at the midsection; the rear will flip over seven times until it collapses. There will be only one survivor. You.""

""That’s..not true."" I had nothing else to say, I could barely get those words out as the scenario played out in front of my eyes. Like a film scrolling across them, a reel of a thousand frames, displaying the most vile scene. The horrifying sight, a stark reality, but brought on by a barbaric fable. Just a masochist’s tale.

""The chef will be in to prepare dinner shortly."" he said, patting the table and hoisting himself up, a series of brittle pops came from his knee. He brushed off his pant leg and strode out lankily through that deceptive door. I envied that freedom. The room never felt so small, and it was only becoming more cramped. 

I could still see the door’s seam, just as hidden as when I first came in, but now the ridges didn’t give as I tugged. Maybe it wasn’t there, I moved from groove to groove, pulling on each one. I scaled the wall like a mad man, pulling in places I knew it couldn’t be, but had no choice but to try anyway. I pounded on the door, throwing my body against it a few times until I bruised. I screamed, calling for someone who could not hear me, or would not care. The world outside the door was silent, as I was to them, for that time I didn’t exist and neither did they. That is a horrid and insoluble isolation. When my over exertion gave way to lightheadedness I involuntarily slide down the wall. Through blurry eyes and a swiveling head I tried to ground myself, but the fog only grew. I felt feverish, as if my eyes could water and sink into my burning face. Then came an unnatural drowsiness; like my weighted blanket made its way up to my face and was smothering me. Naturally the darkness gave way to sleep.

I regained consciousness all at once, a prick in the inner pit of my elbow sending a zap of urgency into my heart. A bulbous nose and a dark, thick, mustache filled my frame of vision. When he put some space between us, I could see those features belonged to a robust man in a chefs attire, holding a syringe. 

Trying to squirm only amounted to the realization that I had been bound to the chair. My hands were duct taped in one large, bulbous mass, my exposed fingers stuck to a knife in my left, and a fork in my right. 

The man walked over to the kitchenette; flicking keys around a ring, sifting through a hoard of them to find the few he needed. One buy one he unlocked units of the kitchen that I couldn’t get into. The hanging cupboard and minifridge on either side a tiered display of spices between them. The man put on an apron, a white fluffy hat; then turned to me. A wide smile on his face, silicon molded dimples on full display: brightly lit by his ivory veneers, one of which had disappeared, the tiny shaved remnants of his true tooth on full display. And his eyes squinted shut; likely the result of botox losing its potency; his puffy dark eyelids left sitting awkwardly on smooth, pearshaped cheeks. 

""What'll it be?"" he said. ""Soup or Salad?"" in a very heavy, coarse accent. 

""Go fuck yourself."" I said before thrashing around to no avail. My biceps were taped against my chest, a zip tie joining my arms at the elbow: and my legs were clamped tight in their massaging nooks. 

""no no. Not a option. Soup or Salad."" 

""I’m not eating anything. I don’t know what sick game you are playing, but I’m not a part of it."" 

“But you see, this is no game. It’s ah..a requirement, you can understand that.""

“No I cannot. I don’t understand how someone can eat a child.”

""You are not eating the baby yet. Just appetizers to start."" 

""Like I said, I’m not eating."" 

""The soup is a very fresh Gnocchi, with ingredients straight from the homeland. Or the crisp caprese salad, also grown from the fertile fields of home.” 

“Where are you from?”

“Across the sea.”

“That applies to everyone.”

“Me most of all.”

I figured it was not worth acknowledging him; that paying attention to him would become maddening: like realizing a gnat is buzzing around your ear and no longer able to ignore it.

 ""I know what you want, the salad, yes?""...""Excellent choice!"" 

He opened a metal compartment which released a mist that snuck out around the edges. Chilled ingredients were sorted on the compact shelves. With expert speed he chopped and tossed the salad, placing it on the table with an extended arm, before folding it behind his back and finishing with a bow.

""Say when."" he said, grating a block of cheese into the bowl. Whether it came from the man, cheese or salad I couldn’t decide, but a pungent smell hit me all at once. Even when the block of cheese was shredded in its entirety into my salad I didn't say a word.

 ""Oh my friend, I hope you chew thoroughly. This may be no bueno on its way out."" he said with a deep laugh, and returned to his station. After dropping the grater and some other dishes in the sink he clapped his hands together and said his goodbyes. 

""Au revoir mon ami, I do hope you enjoy. I’ll begin dinner when you're ready."" 

""I'm telling you now, I’m not gonna be ready."" 

""Ah, I have a hunch that you will be."" 

The next 20 minutes crawled by. Thrashing around in my seat had no noticeable effect on my restraints. Despite my forearms having some mobility, my range of motion only allowed my to move my useless hands to my face. The sharp golden utinzels in my hand were just a bait, telling I could cut myself loose. In reality all I could do was bring them straight up to my face; which did provide an out if it came to that. 

""It looks like you haven't touched your salad. Is it no good?"" He said when he returned.

""I told you I wasn't eating it."" 

""Then you must be saving your appetite for the main course, yes?"" 

""No."" 

""I will prepare the meal anyway. The smell of food always brings out hunger."" 

Opening the mysterious remaining cabinet beside the spice rack, with two gentle hands the chef reached in for something. From out of it he pulled a little mass of cloth, pulling it into the crease of his arms and readjusting its weight. He turned around and in a very soft tone he said. 

""Do you have any allergies?"" 

In his arms was a: plump, blond, sleeping baby, swaddled in a blanket. 

""Oh my god.. It's real.. It's really happening"" I said under my breath.

""I pride myself on never having allergized one of my guests, I want that to continue."" 

I can only imagine I was stark white, with bulging eyes and a slacked jaw, that’s how I felt anyway. An anxiety welling up inside me, far more deep and poignant than what had plagued me hours ago. Those feelings seemed so trivial now. What I would give to be a cowering, small man, in my economy seat again. 

""No allergies? Excellent, the preparations can begin."" 

He plugged the sink and began filling it with water. 

“How can you do this? This is sick, all of this.”

“Somebody has to do it. I have to prepare the meal. You have to eat it. Like it or not, it must be done.”

""I won’t eat it. You'll be killing him for nothing."" 

""Her, actually. That's all that we know. She has no name. No family. No identification. Seven people knows she exists. Nobody will know she's gone."" 

I began to cry. My head falling as far as my restraints would allow, and I sobbed with choking gasps. 

""you can't...you can't do it.."" 

He turned off the sink and looked at me with a viscous scowl, the first time he's dropped the chipper persona. 

""You are unreasonable."" 

He placed the baby back in the cupboard, slapped its door shut and stormed out of the room. I continued to weep even though a slight relief developed, thinking I got out of it. The pressure put on me, and the evil this room has concealed, still crushing me. It felt tainted, a sour putrid air, under the veil of lavender vapor. The smell, I thought was just a placebo, my mind molding the room into my narrative, but something was definitely seeping into the room. 

At first it made my mouth feel foamy; like it was drying out, and a mucky film remained. Then it was arid; a bitter taste like a dentist's numbing paste, laid on top of my sandpaper tongue. The draught moved down my throat, sucking air out with it: it wasn't long before a hiccup like gasp flared up under my sternum. I choked and I coughed, a series of convulsions working to bring something up from inside of me. I started to vomit, spewing from my nose at the first release, the stinging was horrid and the sight was repulsive. The bile seeping in between my clamped thighs. While the vomiting was unpleasant, the dry heaving was torturous. My empty stomach had no more to give; but the gagging carried on. 

At some point the classical music died out, whether it was before my gagging fit or during, I didn’t notice; but when musical ambiance was reintroduced into the room, it was impossible to ignore. Heavy metal, at a headache inducing volume, snapped into the room full bore. I don’t remember what was played in between, but the torture begun with Slayer and ended with Disturbed

Gallons of sweat poured out of me; soaking me in my DIY leather bound sauna. My man-made lubrication proved ineffective in my attempt to slip free: although my efforts had become lackluster; only energy left to swing my head around. I never passed out, that would’ve been a blessing. I danced so close to the land between heat exhaustion, and suffocation: always to be pulled back, into a state of gas induced bulimia. Eventually the gasping did end, far beyond the last point I could’ve been grateful. My whole body was dry, wrung out and depleted of moisture: my sweat soaked body had evaporated, leaving behind a meat scent on my crunchy clothes. 

I barely noticed that someone had entered the room, until my head was pushed into the leather headrest. My crusty, bloodshot eyes fought to see through the grain and piercing light. An unexpected stream of liquid hit them in the pupil and finally caught their attention. Prying hands pulled open my mouth and shot the stream down my throat, no stopping when it grazed my uvulae. I blinked my eyes clear, and hacked water at the hands until they left my mouth. Finally able to see two flight attendants, wearing thin plastic ponchos, over their tightly pressed uniforms. 

""Have you decided to do it yet?"" One asked; a squirt bottle in hand. 

Still drippling and spitting up the excess water I hacked a glob at his shoes, hitting it right in the toe. He clenched his teeth, then his hands, and busted me in the cheek. 

""Mike! We aren't supposed to do that. You'll bruise your knuckles"". The female attendant said, placing a concerned hand on his crinkly shoulder. 

""Let's just get this over with.” He said, while pulling up his ankle and furiously taking a handkerchief to his shoe.

The lady walked to a metal cart they had wheeled in: a dinky thing with four slender legs, and two shelves holding only a few items. She carefully slipped on two oversized leather gloves, flapping the loose fingers around like an old cathers mit. She scrunched the fingers around the tiny handle on an aluminum tray. Steam poured out around the edge of the lid as she opened it: some wrapping around her forearm, urging her to yank away; murmuring obscenities under her breath. 

With long tongs, she reached into the tray and pulled out a folded blue towel, giving it a little shake, before making her strut back to me. 

""This is your last opportunity. We land in two hours. It'll take most of that time for dinner to be prepared and served. We hope you realize what's at stake here."" The lady said. 

""We’re sure you are a rational man. You can do the math, this is one life to ensure the safety of 90."" The man added 

""If ‘morality’ is the cause of your hangup, you must find it immoral to let 90 innocent passengers die"". Said she, it becoming clear at this point they intended to alternate dialogue.

""Deaths that you are aware will occur, as a product of your inaction."" 

""You will not be able to plead ignorance in the life that follows. The blood will stain your hands alone."" 

My breathing had become choppy, not as much from physical torture, but of that going on in my head. Proof that my tear ducts were once again operational, tears fell down my face, mixing into the open wound on my left cheek, and down the blood stream that collected under my chin. 

""I can't do it."" I said between sobs 

""Damn."" The woman said before grabbing my mess of hair and yanking my head back. The red ceiling lights became eclipsed by the blue towel hovering over my face. The tongs released and it slapped onto my face. The sequence of events moved so quickly it took a second for the pain to fully manifest. The heat grew from warm,to unpleasant, to searing. I tried to shake it off but the hand left my hair and grabbed the ends of the towels, snagging it tight around my face. The suffocation went unnoticed while the 2nd degree burn was fresh.

An immediate cooling soothed my face briefly; cold water washing over the burns. The sensation of bliss lasted a moment before the water found my airways. The towel was ripped away, dribblets of water and flesh trailing in the air after it. Intense pain rippled across my face with every hack and cough, trying to clear water from my throat. Bubbling masses coming into view around the edges of my eyes: blisters rising without hesitation. 

""This can end whenever you want!"" The woman said, holding the towel near her chest. 

I had no reserved air to respond with, all I could do was shake my head. Though the torture was unbareable, it was what I deserved. If I would be the only one to crawl through this plane's debris, over the bodies of people I could've saved, I was willing to pay for it. 

The torment went on like that for, god knows how long. The world was reduced to sensations; as if my mind only extended as far as my body. I knew more was out there, but in my restraints, and subdued by my torturers, I was the only person in a tight void. The only relevance time had to me was the hope that I could run out their clock. 

They eventually removed the towel for the last time, and put themselves back together, to resume their facade for the passengers. It didn't matter much anymore, how the passengers saw them, or if they even carried on with their job. There wasn't enough time for dinner. Our fate was sealed. 

I was in paralysis for the remainder of the trip. We hit patches of turbulence periodically, any disturbance felt as if it could’ve been the last. None of it startled me, the extent of my acknowledgement was feeling my head bob and sway around. I experienced something I rarely ever did: complete complacency. 

No smooth words, great performance, bribe, promise, or wish, would change what was coming. A terrible thing, but it was inevitable now. It was just me, and a short stretch of time before the course of my life would be split in two. It was absolute clarity without the peace. Moreso a desperate acceptance; the terms were very grim, but I made a choice. 

I likely could've escaped in that time. My restraints had become waterlogged and lost much of their grip. With enough thrashing they could've come undone; but where to go after that? That is the horror of an aircraft, the hopelessness that comes when you board. People have no clue where the real horror lies. People have no clue about the room nestled near the cockpit, where a dinner is forced on a passenger every flight. 

A buttery smooth voice entered the room like spoiled milk. The pilot's voice came over the entercom. 

""Ladies and Gentlemen, we are beginning to make our descent. The local time is 3:19, and the sky is clear. We want to thank you for flying with us today, and wish you safe travels ahead."" 

Then a flight attendant entered the room. Clacking her heels towards me before placing a hand on my shoulder and shoving my back into the seat. My eyes met hers, and she spoke through gritted teeth. 

""I hope you're happy. Mr. Lucky. Make sure to live it up, for us."" 

She reached over me, to grab a bottle of liquor. She pulled out a scattering of loose pills, and scarfed them all down. Flicking the decanters plug off with her thumb she took a big swig, some trickling out the sides of her mouth. Wiping her face clean she walked to the far wall, pressing her back to it and sliding down to the floor. 

""The Captain said I could if I stayed in here. I want to be out cold before we land."" 

Other flight attendants entered, also pouring themselves drinks and lying on the floor as we made our way closer to the ground. They berated me for what I did to them: cursed my name, put hex’s on my bloodline. I only felt pity for them. If this was how they wanted to spend their final moments, I would allow it. I thought it was a true display of their character, to end their lives like that. Letting their cruelness seep out. The finality of the death bed, does have a way of revealing truths. The most raw look at someone's life, and how it consistently ends. I wanted to die with my morality intact: I lost that the moment I booked this flight. 

Our ears began popping and we knew we were getting close. The pill popper had already faded away, others were severely wasted, and sobbing came from the ones who only managed a buzz. The wheels touched the ground hard. An anticipated feeling, but was impossible to prepare for. Multiple bounces up and down as the tires made contact, only to lose its footing right after. It rattled my empty stomach; its deep, hollow ache returning after a long absence. The tilting took longer than expected, it could’ve been happening without our knowledge. But the anticipation only grew, the dread becoming unbearable, for an event everyone assumed to be instant. The plane sturdied itself, and the force pressing on our bodies lightened. We were slowing down. Not the violent slowing of the wing scrapping tar, it was completely mechanical. Even as the plane drove around the landing strips, slowly taking corners, we couldn't be certain the accident was avoided. If fate was at play, an unexpected and contrived sequence of events could take place any moment. But the plane docked. The captain came into the room, summoning the attendants to assist the passengers as they exited. 

""It didn't happen."" one of the attendants said with a flabbergasted expression, ""This has never happened."" 

""My god."" another said, ""Was it a lie? Did I do it for nothing!"" She clutched her face and began to sob. 

The pilot quickly shooed the in-tact attendants out of the room, shutting the door behind them. He stepped over the sobber who had sprawled herself across the floor, with her face pressed against the wood: her muffled sobs trickled out between the cracks, as did her tears. Taking a tiny pair of scissors out of his pocket he started to cut at the duct tape. 

""This will take a while. I can't bring anything larger on board. You know how strict the rules are."" 

""We didn't crash. You were lying."" I said

""I was not. This is unexpected. Incredibly rare."" 

""That's bullshit. Why would this flight be the one that's spared?"" 

""It's not our place to know, or ask. This is a blessing, count it as one. And tread lightly, charity comes at a cost to someone."" 

He finished cutting at my bonds, I stretched and squeezed my hands to regain the feeling that I had done so long without. They shook as I, numb and feebly pulled at the dangling tape. It was a laborious task that I knew going into it I wouldn't finish. I stood up with strips still clung to me; bunching up the back of my jacket, and tucked into my pants. I was covered in the residual stickiness, the blotchy film that remains, even after paint has been torn from the walls. My smell was atrocious too, layers of sweat and B.O. with a bile finish. It would soon be masked though.

The pilot came in with a half filled coffee pot. From an arms length away he stopped walking and flung it my way. The coffee sloshed out, and engulfed my face. As it wrapped around my head I braced for the scorching to set in, but it was only mild. No more pain than if anything touched my already peeled, and blistered face. As it settled in, it proved to be incredibly thick and dark; like laundry detergent stained black. 

""It's been on the burner for a very long time. We call it diesel, thick as oil and will have you running all night."" He said. 

""What's your fucking problem?"" I asked as I shook beads of the slop off my hands, and fanned out my soaked shirt. 

""When you get off the plane, head to the medical station and tell them about your accident. Then call our company, file a complaint and show them your face. They will apologize, promise to brew the coffee colder, and pay you off."" 

""People have to know what happened here. They'll stop flying if they do."" 

""You know people won't stop flying. This tech is a miracle. Even with the baggage that comes with it."" 

Two flight attendants returned, having escorted everyone else off the plane. 

""Would you two carry her to the medics?” Nudging the unconscious woman with his foot. “Bring our volunteer with you while you're at it."" The pilot said, placing a firm hand on my damp shoulder. I swatted it off and gathered up my things as the attendants held the woman in the air, one at her feet, the other under her shoulders. Her hands dragged the entire way, we stopped a few times to cross them over her body but they always fell again. 

I sat in the medics station for a while, all it amounted to was giving me a change of clothes, and ice for my face. They said I would have to be transferred to a nearby hospital for real treatment. As I waited for the squad to arrive, I used the time to reach out to my family. I knew my mom would be antsy to know how the flight went, but more urgently I had to tell them what hospital I was going to. When I turned my phone off of airplane mode I received a wall of notifications, with numerous missed calls, and texts from my family. I called my mom back, ringing multiple times, before a soft, quiet, hello picked up. 

""Hey Mom, what's going on?"" 

""Did you just land?"" she asked. 

""Yeah a little bit ago, I'm still at the airport. Is everything alright?"" 

""Your Dad started getting really bad a couple hours ago. His throat is very swollen with an infection, and it could lead to pneumonia. They put him on a ventilator, and we’re waiting for the swelling to go down so they can remove some of the fluid. If he goes in for surgery, it’ll be very risky, and they want us to see him, in case, it doesn’t go well."" ",1,1765223444.0,u_Walnut_St,0,1.0,False
1phmbej,https://i.redd.it/hkcmy0qkb16g1.jpeg,Review #14: Old Fitzgerald 9 Year Decanter (Spring 2025),"INTRODUCTION: Story time! Last Thursday I was with my dad in Louisville. We visited the distilleries and bars without doing any hunting, but rather enjoying the amazing pours and experiences that the city has to offer. The next morning on our way to grab coffee, we saw a bunch of people excitedly going in and out of the Evan Williams experience. When we decided to investigate, we were greeted by a bottle we have never seen before in our lifetimes for MSRP: an Old Fitzgerald decanter. We went straight to the register, counted our blessings, and went on our merry way to Bardstown with the score of the trip.

Now we’ve never considered going through the effort for allocations on these trips, but the William Heaven Hill 19 was tempting us both to get up early and test our luck once again. After checking Facebook and discovering the 200+ line at 6am, we opted to laugh and go back to bed. Thank god we did, because upon arrival at 9:30am we saw hundreds of salty faces leaving after they announced only 60 or so bottles of Old Fitzgerald 9. We felt like we lucked out again, just in a different way.

Enough of that however, I’ve been waiting too long to try one of these!

PRICE: $160

AGE: 9 years

PROOF: 100

COLOR: Light/yellow amber

NOSE: As I dive in I’m met with light cherry, green apple, and an extremely delicate caramel coating. Similar to the caramel notes, the oak presence is very delicate, and I actually pick up on a decent bit of what can best be described as a “soggy wood” funk.

At the base layer there’s some chocolate notes that appear too, but overall I was left feeling that the nose was rather muted and simple. Maybe that is due to the fact that this was only opened a couple days ago, but I really hope it opens up more with time.

PALATE: Extremely smooth, viscous, and dense. There’s a bunch of oak spice packed into the front that becomes an incredibly powerful barrel char note as it continues. As it progress, it mellows into caramel and wood sugars, but the char still gives these sweeter characteristics a nice smokey presence. 

Through the mid palate there’s a decent nuttiness with cherry that acts as a nice transition between the intense front palate and lighter finish.

FINISH: The char notes linger longer than anything else, but even that flavor doesn’t hang out for too long. Rather than amping back up or do anything on the finish, this whiskey goes out with a quiet whisper that I felt disappointed with, especially after how flavorful the palate was.

On second sip I get a lot more sweet oak which definitely rounds out this experience more, even if it does still end rather uneventfully.

CONCLUSION: This is a very interesting pour, especially with the intense char notes that almost remind me of a high-aged Brown-Forman product. Even though it’s great and unique, I wish I could say I liked it a little bit more. To me it comes off very similar to Birthday Bourbon: a pour that’s great but massively overhyped. I’m happy to have this just in time for the holidays, and will share a ton with friends and family, but I’m not eager to go out and get another, even at MSRP.

Cheers!

His blade severed armies.  
His power ended wars.

Yet he was never fully evil.  
He protected humanity—  
and in the same breath,  
separated humans and demons forever.

The clash between him and his brothers shook creation itself.  
No being could witness those battles and remain unmoved.  
They were jaw-dropping.  
Unforgettable.

The wars lasted thousands of years.  
Countless lives were lost.  
Not a single soul would ever forget his na—

“**Was this written by a child?**”

Akira squinted at the page.

“**How boring.**”

He snapped the book shut with a flick.

**TICK.**

“Ah— crap.”

A tiny slice appeared on his finger.  
He blew on it instinctively, holding it up.

He glanced around.

The librarian looked up at him for half a second—  
not in concern, not in suspicion—  
just in the universal way someone looks at *noise*.

She went right back to typing.  
Uninterested.  
Unbothered.  
Absolutely done with life.

Akira forced a laugh.

“Guess I’m gonna die from this papercut, huh?”

She didn’t even blink.

He muttered:

“…tough crowd.”

Silence.





**RING.**  
**RING.**  
**RING.**

Akira sighed and picked up his phone.

“…Hello.”

His posture straightened.  
His eyes sharpened.  
The casual warmth vanished.

A man’s voice blared through the speaker:

**“AKIRA!**  
**Listen, can you come in early today?**  
**Rimi just up and quit—didn’t even give notice.**  
**There’s a mountain of dishes and we’re swamped!”**

Akira exhaled heavily.

“…right.”

He blinked.

He put the book back on the shelf, yawning as he walked out of the aisle.

He pushed the library doors open.

Sunlight spilled across his face.

“…Nice,” he murmured, closing his eyes as he embraced the warmth.

Then he opened them.

And froze.

A swirling distortion hung in the air directly in front of him.

Like a tear in space.  
Like a glitch in reality.

*…Portal?*  
he thought.

Before his brain could even process the word—

**tap.**

A foot nudged the middle of his back.

Light.  
Lazy.  
Almost bored.

Yet somehow strong enough to knock him off his feet.

“H-HUH—?!”

His balance vanished.  
He pitched forward into the distortion.

Instinctively, he twisted mid-fall to see who touched him.

There—  
on the library steps—  
stood a woman.

She wore a full black bodysuit, long-sleeved and slightly baggy around the joints.  
Her dark red hair rested over one shoulder.  
Her eyes were hidden behind tinted black glasses.

Her leg hovered just slightly off the ground—  
the casual follow-through of someone who had just nudged a door closed…  
except the “door” was him.

No expression.  
No tension.  
No hostility.

Just a bored professional doing her job.

Akira’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“**The HELL—?!**”

The portal swallowed him whole before he could finish the sentence.

Light bent.  
Sound warped.  
Her figure vanished as he fell into the unknown.

**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**

Rain tapped against the metal ceiling above him.

Akira’s eyes opened slowly.

A dark room.  
Walls of black steel.  
Cold air brushing against his skin.

He looked down.

A metal floor.  
A metal chair.  
Metal cuffs locking his wrists and ankles in place.

He tried shifting.

“…The hell?”

The restraints didn’t budge.

Before he could gather his thoughts—

**CREAK…**

A heavy metal door slid open.

Akira tensed.  
Instinct took over.  
He forced himself upright, chair and all—  
the legs scraping loudly against the floor as he stood, fully bound.

A silhouette stepped through the doorway.

A man.

“Who are you?” Akira snapped, voice sharper than he expected.

The man muttered something under his breath, stepping into the dull overhead light.

He wore a black bodysuit.  
Short dark-purple hair.  
Slender build.  
Tinted glasses.  
And—unexpectedly—a cane in his hand.

He lifted the cane theatrically.

“**Welcome, Hellspawn.**”

He slicked his hair back with a single slow sweep of his hand, closing his eyes in a dramatic flourish.

He held the pose.

Hand in hair.  
Head tilted slightly.  
Smirk glued to his face.

He didn’t move.

Five seconds passed.  
Then ten.  
Then twenty.

He stayed frozen—  
like a statue built solely to perform the world’s slowest, most over-the-top hair slick.

Akira stared.

The air grew painfully awkward.

Then—

A tiny voice squeaked from behind him.

“U-um… sir…?”

The man didn’t break the pose.

Still hand in hair.  
Still eyes closed.  
Still smirking with unearned confidence.

The voice trembled again.

“…S-sir…?”

A young girl stepped into the light.

Fourteen at most.  
A full black suit far too big for her—sleeves over her hands, pant legs bunching around her shoes.

Brown hair tied in a ponytail, though strands escaped from her shaking.

Round glasses fogged slightly from nervous breathing.

Her entire posture screamed:  
*timid, terrified, deeply regretting being hired.*

She clutched a clipboard like it was a lifeline.

“…S-sir— um— h-he’s… he’s just a normal guy…”

The man’s smirk twitched.

He stayed in the pose for one more stubborn second.

Then his eyes snapped open.

“…What?”

His hand dropped from his hair.

The aura—  
the coolness—  
the entire twenty-second pose—

**collapsed instantly.**

“**WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE’S JUST A NORMAL GUY?!**”

His voice cracked as he spun around, nearly stumbling after committing too hard to his own theatrics.

The girl flinched so violently her glasses slid down her nose.

“H-h-he doesn’t match any Hellspawn readings!  
N-no demonic signatures!  
N-no anomalies at all!  
H-he’s j-just… a civilian!”

The man grabbed his head with both hands.

“WE SET UP A PORTAL FOR THIS!  
WE— I— DID A TWENTY-SECOND HAIR POSE—  
AND HE’S JUST SOME RANDOM GUY?!”

“Oh crap… oh crap… oh crap…”  
the girl whispered, shaking like a terrified NPC.

Silence followed.

Thick.  
Awkward.  
Suffocating.

Akira didn’t speak.

He didn’t need to.

The humiliation filling the room was enough to silence even him.

Finally, he drew in a breath.

“S-so uh… are you guys like what the men in blac—”

His sentence died halfway through.

His throat locked.  
His lungs seized.  
A rough cough tore out of him.

Before he could understand—

The world tilted.

Dust burst around him as his body hit the floor, cheek pressed to cold metal.

He blinked, vision spinning, dizziness crushing him.

He had been standing seconds ago.

“…huh…?”

Then—

A voice colder than steel:

**“I don’t recall giving you permission to speak.”**

Akira froze.

The purple-haired man stepped closer, spinning his cane.  
Metal clicked—  
shifted—  
transformed—

**into a blade.**

A long, sharp point extended toward Akira’s face.

Akira’s eyes widened.  
His breath hitched.  
Every muscle tensed.

The air shifted into something deadly.

“Wait—WAIT! You can’t just kill him, sir!”

The young girl darted forward.

Her glasses shook.  
Her ponytail trembled.  
Her clipboard rattled as she shielded Akira with her tiny frame.

“He’s a civilian! A c-civilian!  
H-he’s not a threat!”

The man didn’t lower the blade.

He only exhaled slowly—humiliation still burning beneath his tinted lenses.

“…Do not test me.”

The girl flinched, but stood her ground.

Akira lay frozen.

Dizzy.  
Disoriented.  
Terrified.

Blood dripped from his nose.

A thin line.

Warm.  
Wrong.

His nose tingled—  
a strange, delayed sensation—  
and then the memory struck him:

He hadn’t collapsed.

He had been **kicked in the face** the moment he spoke.

His hands clenched, ropes digging into his wrists.

A single thought echoed through him:

**I’m in danger.**

His vision blurred…  
darkened…  
faded…

as fear swallowed him whole.

A sound cut through the silence.

**Sllllrp.**

The unmistakable noise of someone sucking the last bit of juice through a straw.

Akira forced his blurry eyes open.

A figure walked into the room.

A woman.

Black suit.  
Long strides.  
Casual posture—far too casual for a torture chamber.

Akira’s vision swayed, but he managed to mutter under his breath:

“…red hair…?”

She was drinking from a small carton of **apple juice**, the straw still between her lips as she stopped in front of him.

She didn’t bother looking down at him first.

She just inhaled through the straw—  
**slrp**—  
and spoke with absolute confidence:

“Are you ready to answer our questions, Hellspawn?”

Silence.

No one responded.

Not the girl.  
Not the purple-haired man.  
Not even Akira, half-unconscious on the floor.

“…um… Miss Ren,”  
the little girl whispered, tugging lightly at the woman’s sleeve.

Ren leaned down as the girl whispered into her ear.

The room held its breath.

**Silence.**

Ren nodded once.

“I see.”

She nodded again.

“I see.”

She nodded a third time.

Still sipping her juice.

Silence stretched.

Then—

Ren’s expression snapped.  
Her voice boomed, shaking the room:

**“WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE’S JUST A NORMAL GUY?!”**

Her shout echoed off the metal walls with enough force to knock dust loose from the ceiling.

The girl flinched.  
The purple-haired man winced like he’d been stabbed in the pride.

Akira?

He could only lie there, dizzy and bleeding slightly, thinking:

*…who ARE these people?*

“This is all your fault, Ren! You’re the one who told us he was clearly part of them!”  
the purple-haired man shouted.

Ren shot back instantly:

“The hell you mean, dumbass?! *You* were the one monitoring him!”

Their arguing rose, sharp and messy.

The young girl clamped her hands over her ears.

Akira, still on the floor, muttered:

“…apart of them…?”

Then everything blurred.

The room.  
The shouting.  
The lights.

His thoughts collapsed into raw sensations.

**Inner thoughts:**

*it hurts.*  
*it hurts.*  
*it burns.*  
*why does it burn so much…?*  
*hey.*  
*where am I…?*  
*why does it—*  
*hey.*  
*…that’s not my voice…?*  
*hey…?*

A shadow moved in front of him.

His mind flickered.

Then—

**“HEY.”**

Loud.  
Sharp.  
Real.

Akira’s eyes snapped open.

Ren was crouched in front of him, one hand gripping his chin, forcing him to look up.

Her voice…  
was the *hey* he’d been hearing.

“Stay awake,” she said, annoyance dripping from every word.  
“I wasn’t done talking to you.”

The burning inside him surged again.

Ren slammed her fingers against the holographic keyboard.

**BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.**

Multiple screens flickered into existence around Akira — security feeds, files, blurry images of him walking into the library.

The purple-haired man jabbed his finger at one screen.

“**THERE! SEE?!**”

The image showed Akira…

…holding a book.

Ren exploded.

“WHO,” she shouted,  
“**WALKS INTO A GOVERNMENT-SEALED LIBRARY WITH FIFTY THOUSAND BOOKS—**  
**AND PICKS UP** ***THE*** **MOST SACRED, RESTRICTED, HEAVILY GUARDED ONE—**  
**READS FOUR PAGES—**  
**AND JUST LEAVES?!**”

Her voice cracked the air.

“No human does that in a library,”  
the purple-haired man muttered, genuinely shaken.

Akira stared.

Shock. Confusion. Fury.

“…Huh?” he exhaled.

Then louder —

“WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN?!  
YOU KIDNAPPED ME OVER— WHAT?!  
OVER READING A BOOK FOR FOUR SECONDS?!”

His voice echoed around the steel walls.

The young girl covered her ears, shrinking under the tension.

Then—  
softly:

“Um… Mister Akira…?”

Akira turned, still panting.

She stepped forward.

Still trembling.  
Still timid.  
Still clutching her clipboard.

But her voice—

It shifted.

Not scared.  
Not stuttering.

Just… resigned.

“So here’s what’s going to happen,” she said quietly.

Then she corrected herself.

“No…  
I’m sorry.”  
Her eyes lowered.  
“Here is what **already happened**.”

Akira froze.

Ren and the purple-haired man stiffened—  
not daring to interrupt her.

The girl inhaled shakily.

“You entered a government-protected library…”  
Her voice was small.  
Fragile.  
Accurate in a way that chilled the room.

“…that is run by world leaders.”

Akira blinked.

“You had a bomb with you.”

His breath caught.

“You were a mule in a terrorist operation.”

His pulse spiked.

“They bribed you.”

His heart dropped.

“Police officers responded.  
There was a shootout between law enforcement and the terrorists.”

Ren looked away.  
The purple-haired man swallowed hard.

The girl forced the last words out, barely a whisper:

“And then…  
you detonated the bomb.”

Silence swallowed the room whole.

She continued:

“Hundreds died.”  
Her voice cracked.  
“Including you.”

Akira’s knees weakened despite being tied to the chair.

“You understand… right?” she whispered.

Ren and the purple-haired man stared at the floor.

Avoiding Akira’s eyes.  
Avoiding the truth they forced on him.

Akira’s voice broke.

“…what…?”

His chest tightened.

“What…?”

The burning inside him spread like fire under his skin.

“**WHAT?**”

“**Operation Re:Birth.**”

Ren muttered it so quietly it barely existed.

The room fell dead silent.

**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**

Akira’s sweat hit the metal floor in slow, trembling drops.

His breathing turned thin.  
Fragile.  
Shallow.

Without warning—

**SNAP.**

The purple-haired man flicked his cane.  
The blade folded back in a smooth, unnatural motion—  
and with a single, effortless sweep—

**the ropes binding Akira split apart.**

He didn’t even *feel* the moment they loosened.

One second bound.  
The next—

**empty.**

His arms dropped limply to his sides.  
His legs shook under him.

He wasn’t free.  
He wasn’t safe.

He was just… **untied.**

The young girl closed her eyes.

A long inhale.  
A trembling exhale.

Her voice came out like something delicate breaking:

“**The aftermath was… horrible.**”

Akira’s chest tightened.

“Your boss couldn’t believe you would do such a thing.”

His heart stuttered.

“Your girlfriend was extremely upset.  
She said you were a kind soul… yet this world is full of liars.”

Her lips quivered.

“I can’t believe you’d let her cry so much… what a horrible thing to do.”

Her hand pressed to her chest,  
her eyes glued to the floor,  
refusing to look at him —  
not out of anger,

but out of **shame on his behalf.**

Akira’s breath faltered.

His pulse hammered.

“Your family… see you as a failure now.”

Ren and the purple-haired man both turned their heads away.

Cowards.

The girl continued, voice cracking:

“Your university lecturers and friends couldn’t believe it.”

Her tiny fingers curled around the clipboard.

“They said you were smart.  
Wise.  
Trusted.  
Loved.”

**Silence.**

The kind of silence that makes the world feel smaller.  
Heavier.  
Colder.

Then—

She looked up.

Her eyes glistened with guilt and fear.

“Do you understand?”

It wasn’t a question.

It was a verdict.

Akira’s throat locked.

He didn’t answer.

He *couldn’t.*

Because the truth had already sunk its nails into him:

**The world believed he died a monster.**  
**A terrorist.**  
**A fraud.**  
**A disgrace.**

And these people—

**had rewritten his existence.**

The purple-haired man leaned forward, whispering like something sacred and forbidden:

“**Re:Birth Operation… Glass and Gloss.**”

The words slid under Akira’s skin like poison.

His body trembled violently.

His breath shortened.

“…what the hell is going on…”

The words slipped out of him like a dying thought.

He looked down at his right hand—

It was shaking uncontrollably,  
fingers twitching,  
palm spasming like it didn’t belong to him anymore.

He tried to clench it.

He couldn’t.

His hand was no longer listening.

His body was no longer *his.*

Ren sighed.

A heavy, exhausted breath —  
like someone who had finally reached a checkpoint she never wanted to.

“…Alright. I guess it’s time.”

Akira stumbled backward, nearly tripping over his own feet.

“T-Time for what?!”

His voice cracked.

He was shaking uncontrollably.

drip.

He looked at his hand.

The tiny paper cut from earlier —  
the stupid little thing he joked about dying from —  
was still bleeding.

Except now…  
the wound pulsed.

The blood **gushed** a little more each second.

drip.

His brown hair swayed slightly —  
even though there was no wind in the metal room.

His eyes widened.

And then —

The door behind Ren slid open.

More people walked in.

And more.

And more.

Whispers.  
Muttering.  
Breaths that didn’t belong to any face he recognized.

Their voices blended together into a low, nauseating drone.

Were there ten?

Twenty?

Thirty?

Forty?

The young girl was gone.  
The purple-haired man was gone.  
Ren was gone.

Everyone he’d met in this nightmare had vanished.

Replaced by a crowd of silhouettes that filled every inch of the room.

Akira’s voice trembled as he shouted:

“WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!”

Silence.

Then—

The entire crowd bowed their heads.

And in perfect unison,

they whispered:

**“Re:Birth — Project Glass and Gloss.”**

Akira blinked—

And the world snapped.





Birds chirped.

A dog barked somewhere.

Warm sunlight pressed onto his skin.

He turned—

People were walking their dogs.

Kids were laughing.

A couple held hands.

Coffee shops buzzed with life.

The clatter of mugs.

The smell of pastries.

Humanity.

He was standing on a familiar street, his shoes scraping concrete as he stumbled to his knees.

His blue jeans tore slightly.

His breath shook violently as he covered his mouth —  
he was going to puke.

“H-Huh…? What…?”

His brain couldn’t process it.

A second ago he was in a steel room.

Now…

Now he was—

Alive?

Free?

Safe?

No.

No, something was wrong.

Very wrong.

Because—

SIRENS.

SIRENS.

SIRENS.

Not one.

Not two.

Dozens.

Akira’s head snapped up as blue and red lights exploded across the street.

Police cars.  
Ambulances.  
Fire trucks.

Dozens of them.

Racing past him.

Their sirens ripped through the peaceful afternoon like knives.

Akira slowly stood, stumbling, staring down the road as chaos surged toward him.

It was still bright outside.

Warm.  
Sunny.  
Alive.

No rain.

No metal walls.

Just—

Pure confusion.

And the feeling —  
burning in his chest and crawling up his spine —  
that something was horribly, irrevocably wrong.

He didn’t know why.

But he followed.

Something in his chest — instinct, dread, gravity — pulled him toward the sirens.

People were already running, gathering, whispering.

And then Akira saw it.

His heart dropped into a black void.

The library he had just been in—

**—was engulfed in flames.**

Not damaged.

Not partially burned.

Destroyed.

The entire structure had collapsed into a mountain of scorched rubble.  
Flames clawed at the sky.  
Black smoke twisted upward like a funeral banner.

Wood crackled.  
Glass shattered.  
Metal warped in the heat.

Akira’s breath vanished.

People stood in clusters, watching, murmuring.

“Bastard…”  
a teenage boy spat.

“Pure filth,”  
an old man muttered with shaking hands.

“That asshole was nothing more than a good-for-nothing terrorist,”  
growled another man.

Akira’s ears rang.

“What…?”

“I heard he was a good man, though…”  
a woman added quietly.

But no one listened to her.

Police pushed civilians back, forming a barrier.  
Detectives stepped through the smoke, holding papers and photographs.

Akira walked forward, eyes empty, feet moving without permission.

A detective raised a sketch above the crowd.

“Has anyone ever seen this man?” he called out.

Akira’s world stopped.

The drawing—

It was him.

A perfect sketch of his face.

His hairstyle.  
His clothes.  
His expression.

Then the detective flipped the page.

A photograph.

Akira holding a bomb inside the library.

His vision fractured.

His knees buckled.

He fell to the ground, palms hitting the pavement.

“Huh…”  
the sound escaped him, barely a breath.

He stared at his hands.

The place where the paper cut should’ve been—

**Gone.**

His nose—  
no longer burning, no trace of blood.

Everything from the metal room—  
the kick, the ropes, the blade—

**undone.**

“What…” he whispered.

“What the hell is Re:Birth…?”

A hand touched his shoulder.

“You alright, pal?”  
a man asked gently.

Another man leaned in.  
“Don’t worry. We’ll find that monster for sure.”

They smiled at him.

Like he was just another civilian.

Like they had never seen his face on the drawing.

Like he wasn’t the man the entire crowd was cursing moments ago.

Akira’s throat tightened.

They didn’t recognise him.

They couldn’t.

Operation Re:Birth erased him.

Replaced him.

Killed him.

And now—

**he was a ghost inside his own life.**

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message and introduce yourself !

It’s been about two months since the move and I’ve been reflecting. I’m in therapy and have a really strong support system (family, partner, friends). Mostly looking for advice and some additional support. I’m already being really hard on myself so not in need of tough love 🤪

I’m going to make a no spend challenge for myself to reset. This has worked really well in the past. This time, I’m going to put it on our fridge as a physical item rather than keeping it digitally. My goal will be now through March to start, and I’ll extend the no spend period from there. This will help me with accountability. 

Off limits items are: clothing, shoes, accessories, jewelry, craft items (I knit and paint). 

Allowed purchases: food, coffee, holiday gifts, experiences (live music, a beer with friends).

\-TB Lightning v TOR Maple Leafs Over 6.5 (-115) | 0.5 Units

‍

**Why This Pick?**

The last 5 straight meetings between these two teams have cashed the Over, friends. That’s an overwhelming statistic – and a trend that I imagine continues tonight based on how Toronto’s offense has looked lately. The Maple Leafs have scored 18 goals in their last 4 outings, and with Tampa averaging 3.36 goals per game this season, I don’t doubt this will be a high-scoring affair. Take the Over to hit.

His blade severed armies.  
His power ended wars.

Yet he was never fully evil.  
He protected humanity—  
and in the same breath,  
separated humans and demons forever.

The clash between him and his brothers shook creation itself.  
No being could witness those battles and remain unmoved.  
They were jaw-dropping.  
Unforgettable.

The wars lasted thousands of years.  
Countless lives were lost.  
Not a single soul would ever forget his na—

“**Was this written by a child?**”

Akira squinted at the page.

“**How boring.**”

He snapped the book shut with a flick.

**TICK.**

“Ah— crap.”

A tiny slice appeared on his finger.  
He blew on it instinctively, holding it up.

He glanced around.

The librarian looked up at him for half a second—  
not in concern, not in suspicion—  
just in the universal way someone looks at *noise*.

She went right back to typing.  
Uninterested.  
Unbothered.  
Absolutely done with life.

Akira forced a laugh.

“Guess I’m gonna die from this papercut, huh?”

She didn’t even blink.

He muttered:

“…tough crowd.”

Silence.

**RING.**  
**RING.**  
**RING.**

Akira sighed and picked up his phone.

“…Hello.”

His posture straightened.  
His eyes sharpened.  
The casual warmth vanished.

A man’s voice blared through the speaker:

**“AKIRA!**  
**Listen, can you come in early today?**  
**Rimi just up and quit—didn’t even give notice.**  
**There’s a mountain of dishes and we’re swamped!”**

Akira exhaled heavily.

“…right.”

He blinked.

He put the book back on the shelf, yawning as he walked out of the aisle.

He pushed the library doors open.

Sunlight spilled across his face.

“…Nice,” he murmured, closing his eyes as he embraced the warmth.

Then he opened them.

And froze.

A swirling distortion hung in the air directly in front of him.

Like a tear in space.  
Like a glitch in reality.

*…Portal?*  
he thought.

Before his brain could even process the word—

**tap.**

A foot nudged the middle of his back.

Light.  
Lazy.  
Almost bored.

Yet somehow strong enough to knock him off his feet.

“H-HUH—?!”

His balance vanished.  
He pitched forward into the distortion.

Instinctively, he twisted mid-fall to see who touched him.

There—  
on the library steps—  
stood a woman.

She wore a full black bodysuit, long-sleeved and slightly baggy around the joints.  
Her dark red hair rested over one shoulder.  
Her eyes were hidden behind tinted black glasses.

Her leg hovered just slightly off the ground—  
the casual follow-through of someone who had just nudged a door closed…  
except the “door” was him.

No expression.  
No tension.  
No hostility.

Just a bored professional doing her job.

Akira’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“**The HELL—?!**”

The portal swallowed him whole before he could finish the sentence.

Light bent.  
Sound warped.  
Her figure vanished as he fell into the unknown.

**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**

Rain tapped against the metal ceiling above him.

Akira’s eyes opened slowly.

A dark room.  
Walls of black steel.  
Cold air brushing against his skin.

He looked down.

A metal floor.  
A metal chair.  
Metal cuffs locking his wrists and ankles in place.

He tried shifting.

“…The hell?”

The restraints didn’t budge.

Before he could gather his thoughts—

**CREAK…**

A heavy metal door slid open.

Akira tensed.  
Instinct took over.  
He forced himself upright, chair and all—  
the legs scraping loudly against the floor as he stood, fully bound.

A silhouette stepped through the doorway.

A man.

“Who are you?” Akira snapped, voice sharper than he expected.

The man muttered something under his breath, stepping into the dull overhead light.

He wore a black bodysuit.  
Short dark-purple hair.  
Slender build.  
Tinted glasses.  
And—unexpectedly—a cane in his hand.

He lifted the cane theatrically.

“**Welcome, Hellspawn.**”

He slicked his hair back with a single slow sweep of his hand, closing his eyes in a dramatic flourish.

He held the pose.

Hand in hair.  
Head tilted slightly.  
Smirk glued to his face.

He didn’t move.

Five seconds passed.  
Then ten.  
Then twenty.

He stayed frozen—  
like a statue built solely to perform the world’s slowest, most over-the-top hair slick.

Akira stared.

The air grew painfully awkward.

Then—

A tiny voice squeaked from behind him.

“U-um… sir…?”

The man didn’t break the pose.

Still hand in hair.  
Still eyes closed.  
Still smirking with unearned confidence.

The voice trembled again.

“…S-sir…?”

A young girl stepped into the light.

Fourteen at most.  
A full black suit far too big for her—sleeves over her hands, pant legs bunching around her shoes.

Brown hair tied in a ponytail, though strands escaped from her shaking.

Round glasses fogged slightly from nervous breathing.

Her entire posture screamed:  
*timid, terrified, deeply regretting being hired.*

She clutched a clipboard like it was a lifeline.

“…S-sir— um— h-he’s… he’s just a normal guy…”

The man’s smirk twitched.

He stayed in the pose for one more stubborn second.

Then his eyes snapped open.

“…What?”

His hand dropped from his hair.

The aura—  
the coolness—  
the entire twenty-second pose—

**collapsed instantly.**

“**WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE’S JUST A NORMAL GUY?!**”

His voice cracked as he spun around, nearly stumbling after committing too hard to his own theatrics.

The girl flinched so violently her glasses slid down her nose.

“H-h-he doesn’t match any Hellspawn readings!  
N-no demonic signatures!  
N-no anomalies at all!  
H-he’s j-just… a civilian!”

The man grabbed his head with both hands.

“WE SET UP A PORTAL FOR THIS!  
WE— I— DID A TWENTY-SECOND HAIR POSE—  
AND HE’S JUST SOME RANDOM GUY?!”

“Oh crap… oh crap… oh crap…”  
the girl whispered, shaking like a terrified NPC.

Silence followed.

Thick.  
Awkward.  
Suffocating.

Akira didn’t speak.

He didn’t need to.

The humiliation filling the room was enough to silence even him.

Finally, he drew in a breath.

“S-so uh… are you guys like what the men in blac—”

His sentence died halfway through.

His throat locked.  
His lungs seized.  
A rough cough tore out of him.

Before he could understand—

The world tilted.

Dust burst around him as his body hit the floor, cheek pressed to cold metal.

He blinked, vision spinning, dizziness crushing him.

He had been standing seconds ago.

“…huh…?”

Then—

A voice colder than steel:

**“I don’t recall giving you permission to speak.”**

Akira froze.

The purple-haired man stepped closer, spinning his cane.  
Metal clicked—  
shifted—  
transformed—

**into a blade.**

A long, sharp point extended toward Akira’s face.

Akira’s eyes widened.  
His breath hitched.  
Every muscle tensed.

The air shifted into something deadly.

“Wait—WAIT! You can’t just kill him, sir!”

The young girl darted forward.

Her glasses shook.  
Her ponytail trembled.  
Her clipboard rattled as she shielded Akira with her tiny frame.

“He’s a civilian! A c-civilian!  
H-he’s not a threat!”

The man didn’t lower the blade.

He only exhaled slowly—humiliation still burning beneath his tinted lenses.

“…Do not test me.”

The girl flinched, but stood her ground.

Akira lay frozen.

Dizzy.  
Disoriented.  
Terrified.

Blood dripped from his nose.

A thin line.

Warm.  
Wrong.

His nose tingled—  
a strange, delayed sensation—  
and then the memory struck him:

He hadn’t collapsed.

He had been **kicked in the face** the moment he spoke.

His hands clenched, ropes digging into his wrists.

A single thought echoed through him:

**I’m in danger.**

His vision blurred…  
darkened…  
faded…

as fear swallowed him whole.

A sound cut through the silence.

**Sllllrp.**

The unmistakable noise of someone sucking the last bit of juice through a straw.

Akira forced his blurry eyes open.

A figure walked into the room.

A woman.

Black suit.  
Long strides.  
Casual posture—far too casual for a torture chamber.

Akira’s vision swayed, but he managed to mutter under his breath:

“…red hair…?”

She was drinking from a small carton of **apple juice**, the straw still between her lips as she stopped in front of him.

She didn’t bother looking down at him first.

She just inhaled through the straw—  
**slrp**—  
and spoke with absolute confidence:

“Are you ready to answer our questions, Hellspawn?”

Silence.

No one responded.

Not the girl.  
Not the purple-haired man.  
Not even Akira, half-unconscious on the floor.

“…um… Miss Ren,”  
the little girl whispered, tugging lightly at the woman’s sleeve.

Ren leaned down as the girl whispered into her ear.

The room held its breath.

**Silence.**

Ren nodded once.

“I see.”

She nodded again.

“I see.”

She nodded a third time.

Still sipping her juice.

Silence stretched.

Then—

Ren’s expression snapped.  
Her voice boomed, shaking the room:

**“WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE’S JUST A NORMAL GUY?!”**

Her shout echoed off the metal walls with enough force to knock dust loose from the ceiling.

The girl flinched.  
The purple-haired man winced like he’d been stabbed in the pride.

Akira?

He could only lie there, dizzy and bleeding slightly, thinking:

*…who ARE these people?*

“This is all your fault, Ren! You’re the one who told us he was clearly part of them!”  
the purple-haired man shouted.

Ren shot back instantly:

“The hell you mean, dumbass?! *You* were the one monitoring him!”

Their arguing rose, sharp and messy.

The young girl clamped her hands over her ears.

Akira, still on the floor, muttered:

“…apart of them…?”

Then everything blurred.

The room.  
The shouting.  
The lights.

His thoughts collapsed into raw sensations.

**Inner thoughts:**

*it hurts.*  
*it hurts.*  
*it burns.*  
*why does it burn so much…?*  
*hey.*  
*where am I…?*  
*why does it—*  
*hey.*  
*…that’s not my voice…?*  
*hey…?*

A shadow moved in front of him.

His mind flickered.

Then—

**“HEY.”**

Loud.  
Sharp.  
Real.

Akira’s eyes snapped open.

Ren was crouched in front of him, one hand gripping his chin, forcing him to look up.

Her voice…  
was the *hey* he’d been hearing.

“Stay awake,” she said, annoyance dripping from every word.  
“I wasn’t done talking to you.”

The burning inside him surged again.

Ren slammed her fingers against the holographic keyboard.

**BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.**

Multiple screens flickered into existence around Akira — security feeds, files, blurry images of him walking into the library.

The purple-haired man jabbed his finger at one screen.

“**THERE! SEE?!**”

The image showed Akira…

…holding a book.

Ren exploded.

“WHO,” she shouted,  
“**WALKS INTO A GOVERNMENT-SEALED LIBRARY WITH FIFTY THOUSAND BOOKS—**  
**AND PICKS UP** ***THE*** **MOST SACRED, RESTRICTED, HEAVILY GUARDED ONE—**  
**READS FOUR PAGES—**  
**AND JUST LEAVES?!**”

Her voice cracked the air.

“No human does that in a library,”  
the purple-haired man muttered, genuinely shaken.

Akira stared.

Shock. Confusion. Fury.

“…Huh?” he exhaled.

Then louder —

“WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN?!  
YOU KIDNAPPED ME OVER— WHAT?!  
OVER READING A BOOK FOR FOUR SECONDS?!”

His voice echoed around the steel walls.

The young girl covered her ears, shrinking under the tension.

Then—  
softly:

“Um… Mister Akira…?”

Akira turned, still panting.

She stepped forward.

Still trembling.  
Still timid.  
Still clutching her clipboard.

But her voice—

It shifted.

Not scared.  
Not stuttering.

Just… resigned.

“So here’s what’s going to happen,” she said quietly.

Then she corrected herself.

“No…  
I’m sorry.”  
Her eyes lowered.  
“Here is what **already happened**.”

Akira froze.

Ren and the purple-haired man stiffened—  
not daring to interrupt her.

The girl inhaled shakily.

“You entered a government-protected library…”  
Her voice was small.  
Fragile.  
Accurate in a way that chilled the room.

“…that is run by world leaders.”

Akira blinked.

“You had a bomb with you.”

His breath caught.

“You were a mule in a terrorist operation.”

His pulse spiked.

“They bribed you.”

His heart dropped.

“Police officers responded.  
There was a shootout between law enforcement and the terrorists.”

Ren looked away.  
The purple-haired man swallowed hard.

The girl forced the last words out, barely a whisper:

“And then…  
you detonated the bomb.”

Silence swallowed the room whole.

She continued:

“Hundreds died.”  
Her voice cracked.  
“Including you.”

Akira’s knees weakened despite being tied to the chair.

“You understand… right?” she whispered.

Ren and the purple-haired man stared at the floor.

Avoiding Akira’s eyes.  
Avoiding the truth they forced on him.

Akira’s voice broke.

“…what…?”

His chest tightened.

“What…?”

The burning inside him spread like fire under his skin.

“**WHAT?**”

“**Operation Re:Birth.**”

Ren muttered it so quietly it barely existed.

The room fell dead silent.

**DRIP.**  
**DRIP.**

Akira’s sweat hit the metal floor in slow, trembling drops.

His breathing turned thin.  
Fragile.  
Shallow.

Without warning—

**SNAP.**

The purple-haired man flicked his cane.  
The blade folded back in a smooth, unnatural motion—  
and with a single, effortless sweep—

**the ropes binding Akira split apart.**

He didn’t even *feel* the moment they loosened.

One second bound.  
The next—

**empty.**

His arms dropped limply to his sides.  
His legs shook under him.

He wasn’t free.  
He wasn’t safe.

He was just… **untied.**

The young girl closed her eyes.

A long inhale.  
A trembling exhale.

Her voice came out like something delicate breaking:

“**The aftermath was… horrible.**”

Akira’s chest tightened.

“Your boss couldn’t believe you would do such a thing.”

His heart stuttered.

“Your girlfriend was extremely upset.  
She said you were a kind soul… yet this world is full of liars.”

Her lips quivered.

“I can’t believe you’d let her cry so much… what a horrible thing to do.”

Her hand pressed to her chest,  
her eyes glued to the floor,  
refusing to look at him —  
not out of anger,

but out of **shame on his behalf.**

Akira’s breath faltered.

His pulse hammered.

“Your family… see you as a failure now.”

Ren and the purple-haired man both turned their heads away.

Cowards.

The girl continued, voice cracking:

“Your university lecturers and friends couldn’t believe it.”

Her tiny fingers curled around the clipboard.

“They said you were smart.  
Wise.  
Trusted.  
Loved.”

**Silence.**

The kind of silence that makes the world feel smaller.  
Heavier.  
Colder.

Then—

She looked up.

Her eyes glistened with guilt and fear.

“Do you understand?”

It wasn’t a question.

It was a verdict.

Akira’s throat locked.

He didn’t answer.

He *couldn’t.*

Because the truth had already sunk its nails into him:

**The world believed he died a monster.**  
**A terrorist.**  
**A fraud.**  
**A disgrace.**

And these people—

**had rewritten his existence.**

The purple-haired man leaned forward, whispering like something sacred and forbidden:

“**Re:Birth Operation… Glass and Gloss.**”

The words slid under Akira’s skin like poison.

His body trembled violently.

His breath shortened.

“…what the hell is going on…”

The words slipped out of him like a dying thought.

He looked down at his right hand—

It was shaking uncontrollably,  
fingers twitching,  
palm spasming like it didn’t belong to him anymore.

He tried to clench it.

He couldn’t.

His hand was no longer listening.

His body was no longer *his.*

Ren sighed.

A heavy, exhausted breath —  
like someone who had finally reached a checkpoint she never wanted to.

“…Alright. I guess it’s time.”

Akira stumbled backward, nearly tripping over his own feet.

“T-Time for what?!”

His voice cracked.

He was shaking uncontrollably.

drip.

He looked at his hand.

The tiny paper cut from earlier —  
the stupid little thing he joked about dying from —  
was still bleeding.

Except now…  
the wound pulsed.

The blood **gushed** a little more each second.

drip.

His brown hair swayed slightly —  
even though there was no wind in the metal room.

His eyes widened.

And then —

The door behind Ren slid open.

More people walked in.

And more.

And more.

Whispers.  
Muttering.  
Breaths that didn’t belong to any face he recognized.

Their voices blended together into a low, nauseating drone.

Were there ten?

Twenty?

Thirty?

Forty?

The young girl was gone.  
The purple-haired man was gone.  
Ren was gone.

Everyone he’d met in this nightmare had vanished.

Replaced by a crowd of silhouettes that filled every inch of the room.

Akira’s voice trembled as he shouted:

“WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!”

Silence.

Then—

The entire crowd bowed their heads.

And in perfect unison,

they whispered:

**“Re:Birth — Project Glass and Gloss.”**

Akira blinked—

And the world snapped.

Birds chirped.

A dog barked somewhere.

Warm sunlight pressed onto his skin.

He turned—

People were walking their dogs.

Kids were laughing.

A couple held hands.

Coffee shops buzzed with life.

The clatter of mugs.

The smell of pastries.

Humanity.

He was standing on a familiar street, his shoes scraping concrete as he stumbled to his knees.

His blue jeans tore slightly.

His breath shook violently as he covered his mouth —  
he was going to puke.

“H-Huh…? What…?”

His brain couldn’t process it.

A second ago he was in a steel room.

Now…

Now he was—

Alive?

Free?

Safe?

No.

No, something was wrong.

Very wrong.

Because—

SIRENS.

SIRENS.

SIRENS.

Not one.

Not two.

Dozens.

Akira’s head snapped up as blue and red lights exploded across the street.

Police cars.  
Ambulances.  
Fire trucks.

Dozens of them.

Racing past him.

Their sirens ripped through the peaceful afternoon like knives.

Akira slowly stood, stumbling, staring down the road as chaos surged toward him.

It was still bright outside.

Warm.  
Sunny.  
Alive.

No rain.

No metal walls.

Just—

Pure confusion.

And the feeling —  
burning in his chest and crawling up his spine —  
that something was horribly, irrevocably wrong.

He didn’t know why.

But he followed.

Something in his chest — instinct, dread, gravity — pulled him toward the sirens.

People were already running, gathering, whispering.

And then Akira saw it.

His heart dropped into a black void.

The library he had just been in—

**—was engulfed in flames.**

Not damaged.

Not partially burned.

Destroyed.

The entire structure had collapsed into a mountain of scorched rubble.  
Flames clawed at the sky.  
Black smoke twisted upward like a funeral banner.

Wood crackled.  
Glass shattered.  
Metal warped in the heat.

Akira’s breath vanished.

People stood in clusters, watching, murmuring.

“Bastard…”  
a teenage boy spat.

“Pure filth,”  
an old man muttered with shaking hands.

“That asshole was nothing more than a good-for-nothing terrorist,”  
growled another man.

Akira’s ears rang.

“What…?”

“I heard he was a good man, though…”  
a woman added quietly.

But no one listened to her.

Police pushed civilians back, forming a barrier.  
Detectives stepped through the smoke, holding papers and photographs.

Akira walked forward, eyes empty, feet moving without permission.

A detective raised a sketch above the crowd.

“Has anyone ever seen this man?” he called out.

Akira’s world stopped.

The drawing—

It was him.

A perfect sketch of his face.

His hairstyle.  
His clothes.  
His expression.

Then the detective flipped the page.

A photograph.

Akira holding a bomb inside the library.

His vision fractured.

His knees buckled.

He fell to the ground, palms hitting the pavement.

“Huh…”  
the sound escaped him, barely a breath.

He stared at his hands.

The place where the paper cut should’ve been—

**Gone.**

His nose—  
no longer burning, no trace of blood.

Everything from the metal room—  
the kick, the ropes, the blade—

**undone.**

“What…” he whispered.

“What the hell is Re:Birth…?”

A hand touched his shoulder.

“You alright, pal?”  
a man asked gently.

Another man leaned in.  
“Don’t worry. We’ll find that monster for sure.”

They smiled at him.

Like he was just another civilian.

Like they had never seen his face on the drawing.

Like he wasn’t the man the entire crowd was cursing moments ago.

Akira’s throat tightened.

They didn’t recognise him.

They couldn’t.

Operation Re:Birth erased him.

Replaced him.

Killed him.

And now—

**he was a ghost inside his own life.**",1,1765223158.0,Webnovel,0,1.0,False

I check RS basically every day (don’t judge me, it’s my morning coffee routine) to see what new novels are popping off, and honestly? A bunch of the stuff showing up on the main Rising Stars page is… not great. Like, I’m not saying they’re dumpster fires, but some of them barely scrape a 4.0 and have writing that feels like someone fed ChatGPT a packet of instant noodles and said “make a fantasy world.”

But THEN—here’s the part that really confuses me—if you go into genre-specific Rising Stars, there are stories that are legitimately way better. Better prose, better pacing, actually interesting ideas, and they’ve got higher ratings, better reviews, AND similar follower counts to the weaker stuff on main RS. They’re not obscure hidden gems with 12 followers. These are novels sitting at the bottom of main RS–tier numbers, yet they never show up there.

Like… how?

As a reader it just feels like something’s off. Why are interesting stories with 4.7+ stuck in the genre lists while some lukewarm 4.0 story gets center stage? It kinda defeats the purpose of “Rising Stars.”

1phm4sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1phm4sw/help_with_hygiene_and_personal_care/,Help with Hygiene and Personal Care,"Hello everyone! I'm (23f) seeking some help with my personal hygiene/care. Growing up, my mother didn't really talk about feminine hygiene, or hygiene at all with me, nor was it taught in sex ed. The only thing I really had was the American Girl book ""The Care and Keeping of You"", and it definitely was a big help, but I feel as I get older I need advice on what more to do. Lately I've been uncomfortable with my downstairs for a few different reasons, and I'm starting to feel a bit insecure and embarrassed going out in public with so much crotch related discomfort. I don't have many people in my life that I can talk to for this, so I've come here! :D

Currently I shower every other day, but I'm wondering if I should at least be washing downstairs everyday instead. I notice a smell starts to develop the days in between showers. I don't use any soap on my labia for fear of irritation, only on the areas with hair. Then I use a washcloth with only water to clean around my inner labia. Any tips or recommendations for what I can do to improve on my cleaning routine will be greatly appreciated!

I'm also needing recommendations for new underwear. Recently it seems like every pair I try is uncomfortable in some way. They're either too tight around my inner thighs or my labia and then it feels like it's falling asleep, the quality is poor or itchy, or with some pairs it feels like they stretch out after sleeping in them, and then by the time I wake up my cat is already in the kitchen making breakfast and having coffee! -\_-  I'd prefer to not go commando either, and I definitely prefer shorter-waisted bikini style underwear with full butt coverage. Anything with a high waist tends to dig into my stomach, and I don't like the wedgie sensation of some underwear :(

And for my last question, what do ya'll do with your pubic hair?? It feels like no matter what I do, I just can't be comfortable with it. I have Pili Multigemini, mostly in my pubic area, so it makes it just absolutely unpleasant either way. I've tried shaving bald, trimming the hair with scissors, AND 3 different types of electric trimmers (Manscaped, Philips Norelco, and one other beard trimmer I can't remember the name of). Going natural seems to give me the least discomfort out of everything BUT it's still uncomfortable because of the length and amount of hair. Waxing isn't really an option for me because the women in my family are prone to ingrowns, and I'm not sure how I feel about laser.

Any help at all is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance! 🥹❤️",1,1765223029.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False

Me & All Hotel, Dusseldorf - 6.5/10 - would consider staying here again 

Lindner Hotel, Cologne City Plaza - 7/10 - would stay here again 

Full thoughts, if anyone’s interested: 

Thompson Houston - 8/10 - upgraded to a junior “suite”. Basically just a slightly larger room with a big bathroom. Still a very nice space with HUGE windows and a ton of light. Property in excellent condition. Welcome amenity of a bottle of wine. Had some issues with Glob breakfast - both mornings we went to breakfast towards the tail end of service and by the time we settled our tab the restaurant had switched over to lunch…didn’t think much of this until 2 $75 lunch tabs showed up in my folio. Desk took the charges off when I told them it had been breakfast. 

The Lodge At Spruce Peak - 4/10 - fiancée and I took a quick stay-cation to Stowe and stayed a night here. I realize it’s a ski-on-ski-off property so prices are inflated but my lord is it overpriced. Breakfast was exceedingly mediocre, room was dated, service was indifferent at best (no acknowledgment of Globalist status or mention of benefits), and the layout of the place makes you feel like you’re staying in a large hospital. I realize as a non-skier I probably don’t appreciate the benefits of this property so take this review with a grain of salt. 

Hyatt Place Flushing - 9/10 - still one of my faves. Went up from cat 3 to 4 since my review last year but it’s still one of the best bang-for-your-buck Hyatts in the US. 

Hyatt Regency JFK - 6/10 - nondescript but new HR. Actually had a functioning club lounge (first Hyatt I’ve stayed at in the US since Covid with a functioning regency club, so points there). 10-15 minutes from JFK and close to nothing else. No upgrade offered (didn’t ask, we were there for 11 hours). Would stay here again only if I have an early flight the next morning. 

The Standard London - 7.5/10 - Good location if you need to get to King’s Cross or St. Pancras. Nice staff, veeery trendy (I’m only 37 and the vibes made me feel like I was too old to be there). Breakfast was alright but the server was impeccable. Front desk agent didn’t offer an upgrade at first but when I asked about the globalist breakfast benefit he apologized, said he didn’t realize I was a globalist, and upgraded us to a suite with an amazing balcony with a view of the London skyline. Also the in room coffee was pour-over, which is better than your typical pod brewer. One downside (and it was a big one) is that our room was right next to some sort of party suite and it was LOUD (talking DJ loud) until well into the night. Overall though, would stay here again. 

Park Hyatt Paris Vendome - 9/10 - booked 4 nights and used an SUA. Further upgraded from a Park Suite to a Park Executive Suite. Two full bathrooms and probably 300 square feet of just closet space. Globalist recognition was over the top. In-room dining for globalist breakfast benefit is clutch, considering especially that this can be had at any time of day or night. Champagne, fruit and chocolate as a welcome amenity. Only thing that kept this hotel from being perfect was the booking experience (and I’m making a note of it here because it’s apparently an ongoing issue). When I asked my MHC to attach an SUA after I’d booked the room, she came back and informed me that no suites were available. I had read on flyertalk that the hotel sometimes plays games with standard suite availability so I decided to search for suite availability using the 4 nights I wanted to stay plus 2 additional nights after the fact. Not surprisingly, a standard suite was available for all 6 of the nights (but not for the 4 I was actually trying to book). I mentioned this to my MHC and a few days later, miraculously, the hotel found a standard suite 😂

Bluebird Talta Lodge - 6/10 - first MMS stay. Lovely little property, the Stuga Cabins are super cute. Not much else to say about it though. No restaurant, no coffee in the room. Really just felt like a gussied up motor lodge. But was curious about booking MMS through Hyatt so decided to spend the night. 

Hyatt Regency O’Hare - 1/10 - stayed here on a day rate before a long trip to Asia. Man, I know standards are low in the US these days but this hotel seemed to just NGAF. Leftover snacks in the room from the previous guest. Mold on the fruit at the resto when we went for lunch. Hair on the shower wall. Just, across the board, a mediocre hotel. Would not stay here again. 

Park Hyatt Saigon - 9.5/10 - Stunner of a property and nearly perfect. 5 night stay - used an SUA to book into a Lam Son Suite. Amazing hospitality. Great location in district one. Showed up much too early to check in to our suite but the hotel volunteered a standard room for us to use until the suite was ready (didn’t have to ask for this btw). Excellent Glob breakfast - not the biggest buffet but everything of exceedingly high quality. Could also order anything off the menu. Had dinner one night at Square One. Excellent food but crazy expensive, especially by Vietnamese standards. Nice pool too. Took advantage of the spa facilities and received a 90 minute massage for the price of 60 minutes as a globalist. Literally the only downside I can come up with is that the lighting in the room was a bit poorly designed. 

Grand Hyatt Taipei - 7/10 - not a bad property. As Grands normally go, it’s huge. Got upgraded to a studio (Jr. Suite type room) which wasn’t bad at all. Clean, spacious, etc. Had breakfast in the Grand Club 2 of the three mornings and happy hour one night. Nothing really to write home about but it’s not a bad club. Location is good, 5 minute walk from the MRT red line and across from 101, but maybe not the most central. Takes about 20 minutes on public transit to get to Taipei Main Station and about an hour and a bit from TPE airport. 

Hyatt Regency Taoyuan Airport - 6/10 - Location can’t be beat though the property is in need of upgrades.  Upgraded to a deluxe king room with airport view. Bathroom has a tub/shower combo with no real shower head, just a handheld wand and no way to affix it higher up. There’s a coin-opp laundry room for guests which is nice. 1 stop on the MRT (or free shuttle bus) to terminals 1/2. Otherwise there’s literally nothing around the hotel.  Regency club is serviceable (happy hour from 5-7 with plenty of booze and enough food to make into dinner) and has a great view of the airport/aprons. 

Park Hyatt Kuala Lumpur - 6/10 - stayed for three nights and used an SUA. I realize the hotel was pretty new, but there were plenty of issues. When we arrived at 3:15 PM, they seemed unprepared for us and we were informed that our room was not ready yet. This is not itself an issue, I realize with upgraded rooms they’re often not ready right at 3 PM, but I can’t help but juxtapose this with the experience at the PH Saigon where a room was provided for us until our suite was ready. Good service recovery though and offered to cover lunch or dinner for us during our stay (although this dinner was one of the worst meals we had while in Asia and would’ve been an enormous disappointment had we actually paid). Park suite here is huge - the room is tasteful though I have to imagine a lot of the fixtures are not going to age well (a lot of the fixtures give me ikea vibes). Location isn’t great. Hard to walk anywhere from the property. The building isn’t finished so getting to and from the hotel itself involves walking through a weirdly empty lobby area. The elevators don’t all work. Overall, this place would be relatively disappointing as an Andaz, let alone as a PH, and imo it’s getting away with a lot by relying on its unique location at the top of the world’s second tallest building. 

Hyatt Regency Kuantan - 9/10 - before I write anything about this hotel I need to recognize that everyone here, from the bellmen to the housekeepers to the bartenders were some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. That alone makes this hotel worth visiting. Also, it’s a category 1 property on a gorgeous beach far from the shenanigans of other southeast Asian resort destinations. Booked 4 nights into a regency suite on points - 8k per night. Ever so slightly dated property but well maintained. Good buffet breakfast and a full meal available nightly in the regency club (oh and the club manager was the absolute best). For the price and the location I literally cannot think of a better place to spend a few days unwinding. 

Andaz Singapore - 7.5/10 - nice room, service not super personable (at least by SE Asian standards). Breakfast big/decent. Location is meh but attached to Bugis MRT so convenient to transit. 

Hyatt Place Montreal Downtown - 8/10 - Very nice for a HP. Room on top floor - excellent views of DT MTL. Nespresso in room. Parking garage super tight. 

Me and All Hotel Düsseldorf - 6.5/10 - first M&A hotel. Good location. Slightly dated. Upgraded to a deluxe king room. Room was big, but weird layout. Bathroom takes up half the room (the half with windows, so the bedroom portion of the room is dark). Breakfast is serviceable, but not anything special. The hotel was very busy (Xmas markets…), but the few staff we interacted with were pleasant, in an austere German sort of way.  

Lindner Hotel Cologne City Plaza - 7/10 - halfway between Altstadt and Belgian Quarter. Pretty dated hotel but clean and the staff were quite nice. Upgraded to junior suite, big bathroom with a tub. Again, no windows in the bedroom, just the living room. Thermostat didn’t work super well and because the bedroom was away from the windows it was hard to get it cool enough to sleep comfortably. Breakfast was fine - all buffet - but nothing special. ",6,1765223025.0,hyatt,8,0.8,False

We’re [Amour by Anjali](https://amourbyanjali.com/), a small homegrown scented candle studio that has grown from a kitchen-table hobby into a full-fledged passion project, and we wanted to share something we've been experimenting with lately.

Over the past few months, we’ve noticed a rising conversation around sensory spaces, work-from-home routines, and how small rituals can genuinely influence our mood. One particular request kept popping up in our DMs and customer chats: [coffee scented candles](https://amourbyanjali.com/collections/coffee-scented-candles).

So, we finally gave in and started working on a blend that captures the first whiff of freshly brewed coffee: warm, roasty, slightly sweet, and comforting without being overpowering. What surprised us is how many people began using it as part of their morning routine, almost like a grounding ritual before starting their day.

We’re curious to hear from this community:

* Do you use candles as part of your productivity or relaxation spaces?
* Are coffee-themed or beverage-inspired scents something you genuinely enjoy, or do you prefer more traditional florals and vanillas?
* And for those who’ve tried similar scents, did you find them energising or more calming?

Reddit has always been a space where we discover honest, unfiltered opinions, so any feedback helps us as a brand trying to create products that actually make sense for people’s lifestyles.

If you’ve come across Amour By Anjali before, we’d also love to know what scents you'd want to see next!

I was having coffee with my friend last night and there was a cute guy sitting a few tables near us working on his laptop. After an hour or two of being at the café, he approaches our table and talks to me, which caught me really off guard. 

He said my style was unique and he really liked it. He asked where I got my style from and I just said shyly from my mind and thanked him. I'm shy and I felt I could have elaborated more, plus, although I do think I am attractive, my friend is usually the one who always gets hit on more when we go out. So I was surprised he approached me and not her. He then asked for my name, he told me his name and shook my hand and said it was nice to meet me. But that was it. I thought he'd ask for my number or social media. 

I wish I had said more, like how I noticed his cool stickers on his laptop or asked if he was a podcaster, because I thought he was doing some kind of video or audio work at the cafe. I only know his name, which is a very common male name in this big city.

My friend said maybe he was shy too and didn't ask for my contact info. Should I have done that? Again I was really caught off guard, shy, and usually it's my friend who gets approached first when we're out. I go to this cafe often, it's one of my favorites. I've never seen him before but he was sitting with a guy who was working and I've seen who I assume is his friend (they both left together) three times already there but never him. 

I guess I'm wondering: 1) how should I have done better? 2) Was it okay not to give him my number or social media since he didn't ask? 3) If I see him again, should I approach him or at least wave and smile? 4) If I see the guy he was sitting next to again without the guy who approached me, should I ask him to give that guy my info?

Budget ideally will be between $2000-$3000 (+ tax). Yeah it is an expensive gift...

a few general notes (per the rules of the sub)

1) location is the US (midwest), the house does not have a filtration system (there is a water softener). Installing a RO system is not possible for the next 12 months or so. I am assuming  (and I might be dumb to assume that), that you can use bottled water (purified/ distilled/ other)?

2) the couple prefers to drink Lattes (12 oz ones), usually drink together at least one cup per day, but both drink 2 per day (although pour over is also an option for their 2nd cup). 

3) there isn't a ton of limitation for the counter top space wise, although there will be a cabinet over the machine (there is no place on the counter without a cabinet over, in case it matters)

  
4) they are not brand new to coffee (drinking it), one worked with equipment in some capacity, but good to assume very beginner level.

  
5) they have a kitcehnaid burr grinder KCG8433BM and can't really upgrade that one at the moment to something else  (in case that matters).

  
Now for the machines and such, since it is a gift (and an expensive one), I lack some of the expertise of knowing everything about this world, and in addition to what to buy, it might be also useful to know where to buy :)

  
I will say that in the past they had the ""cheap machines"" like a 100-200$ delonghi and those were not good, served their needs.

I looked into a few machines including , but I am not set on anything), and not sure what to even do to compare between them. Quality, durability and such is a lot more important then beauty (as in, it does not have to be stylish with wooden features and such)  

1) La Spaziale Vivaldi II (I know there are S1 and S2, but I don't know what the difference)

2) Lelit Bianca Espresso Machine

3) Rocket Espresso Appartamento Espresso Machine

4) Rocket Espresso R58 Cinquantotto Espresso Machine

  
I am happy to try an educate myself in order to do better compression, so even comments like ""go watch XYZ"" or ""read this"" are very welcomed.

I am a UF student in Gainesville working on turning my original 2 player strategy card game, **Espionage**, into a mobile app. I am looking for:

**1. A developer** (CS, DAS, SWE, or anyone with app or game dev experience)  
**2. A designer** (Digital Arts and Sciences, Graphic Design, UI/UX)

The game is already fully designed as a physical game. I have:

* A complete ruleset and cheat sheet
* Clear turn structure and card types
* A sense of how the digital version should feel and flow

I am looking for people who want a serious, real project for their **portfolio** and future career. This is a **paid** project, but I am a student, so the budget is more student level than studio level. Think of it as a capstone style project rather than a full time job.

**Tech wise**, I am open to Unity, Flutter, React Native, or whatever you are comfortable with for a 2 player, turn based game. Also must be comfortable with implementing a game clock for each player (similar to a chess clock).

**What I am looking for in you:**

* You enjoy strategy or card games
* You are reliable and can meet at least once a week
* You communicate well and are open to iterating on the design
* You want something impressive to show in your portfolio or demo reel

**This would be perfect for:**

* A CS or DAS student who wants to say ""I built and shipped a full mobile game""
* A designer who wants to own the UI and card art of a complete game

**Compensation:**

* Developer: negotiable, likely in the \~$300–$1,000 range for an MVP depending on scope and experience
* Designer: negotiable, roughly \~$150–$500 range
* I am open to structuring this by milestones and can also provide very strong portfolio credit and references

If this sounds interesting, send me:

1. Your name, major, and year
2. A short description of your experience (class projects count)
3. Links to anything you have built or designed (GitHub, [itch.io](http://itch.io), ArtStation, PDF portfolio, etc)
4. Whether you are more interested in development, design, or both

Comment here or DM me and we can talk details, grab coffee on campus, or hop on a quick call to see if it is a good fit.

1phlzj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1phlzj8/aita_for_yelling_at_my_aunt_and_uncle_for_how/,AITA for yelling at my aunt and uncle for how they handled my Nana's death?,"My, 18F, Nana passed away in august of 2022. It was unexpected, she had been perfectly fine that morning, she came home from bingo and had a heart attack.

She had lived with us (My mom, dad, 2 sisters, and I) since before covid. My uncle and aunt (we'll call them mike and lily) lived in a ""big"" city about 3 hours away. She visited them occasionally but always came home after visiting them drained because of my cousins (now 13F and 9M). They were very hyper, and her arthritis always flared up when she went down. She was also a neat freak and their house always looked like a hurricane tore through it, and my Nana, being the stubborn woman she was would always try to clean.

I'm in no way saying they used her or that they made her do these things, just that she could only stay there for a week or so at a time because it was hard on her body. At home she almost never did any house work except for the dishes when she was feeing up to it. We all knew how to make her coffee (mom did every morning) and we (mostly my mom) would bring her new icepacks every few hours.

When she passed my father shouldered the burden of planning everything; He was dealing with the funeral, and the death certificate, and other legal stuff, on top of his grief.

Within the week we had the wake, and she was cremated. At the wake my mother said something to my aunt but then immediately apologized for it. I walked upstairs the day after the wake, where Mike was asking my dad about spreading the ashes (which we didn't even have yet). my dad was in the dining room, surrounded by papers, hands on his head. My uncle continued to pester my dad about this for a solid 10 minutes. My father kept saying ""i don't know"" and ""can we talk about this when i'm done with this stuff"", ""i just want to get the paperwork done"". My uncle pushed until my dad snapped. He started yelling and crying, which was something i never saw before. My dad had told him to stop, begged him even, we all did, and he just wouldn't listen. My aunt came in and so did my mom, and all hell broke loose. It was all a blur but there was yelling from all sides. My dad was saying ""you just couldn't stop, you had to keep pushing me"", my uncle was playing the victim ""I don't know why you're yelling at me, i just asked you a question"". And then the accusations started, my mothers past with drugs, and nana's missing pills were brought up. after a particularly nasty comment about my mother from mike(i don't remember what he said exactly), i yelled, ""f\*\*\* you! we are all hurting but there is no excuse to be acting like this!"". I apologized to my cousins for swearing and they all left. My parents made it clear they would never forgive them for the things they said.

I guess i just want to know if me and my family are the assholes for being upset. i left some stuff out because of the character limit but if anyone has questions about what exactly was said, let me know!",1,1765222704.0,AmItheAsshole,5,1.0,False

1phlt05,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1phlt05/aitj_for_yelling_at_my_aunt_and_uncle_after_my/,AITJ for yelling at my aunt and uncle after my Nana died?,"My, 18F, Nana passed away in august of 2022. It was unexpected, she had been perfectly fine that morning, she came home from bingo and had a heart attack.

She had lived with us (My mom, dad, 2 sisters, and I) since before covid. My uncle and aunt (we'll call them mike and lily) lived in a ""big"" city about 3 hours away. She visited them occasionally but always came home after visiting them drained because of my cousins (now 13F and 9M). They were very hyper, and her arthritis always flared up when she went down. She was also a neat freak and their house always looked like a hurricane tore through it, and my Nana, being the stubborn woman she was would always try to clean.

I'm in no way saying they used her or that they made her do these things, just that she could only stay there for a week or so at a time because it was hard on her body. At home she almost never did any house work except for the dishes when she was feeing up to it. We all knew how to make her coffee (mom did every morning) and we (mostly my mom) would bring her new icepacks every few hours.

When she passed my father shouldered the burden of planning everything; He was dealing with the funeral, and the death certificate, and other legal stuff, on top of his grief.

Within the week we had the wake, and she was cremated. At the wake my mother said something to my aunt but then immediately apologized for it. I walked upstairs the day after the wake, where Mike was asking my dad about spreading the ashes (which we didn't even have yet). my dad was in the dining room, surrounded by papers, hands on his head. My uncle continued to pester my dad about this for a solid 10 minutes. My father kept saying ""i don't know"" and ""can we talk about this when i'm done with this stuff"", ""i just want to get the paperwork done"". My uncle pushed until my dad snapped. He started yelling and crying, which was something i never saw before. My dad had told him to stop, begged him even, we all did, and he just wouldn't listen. My aunt came in and so did my mom, and all hell broke loose. It was all a blur but there was yelling from all sides. My dad was saying ""you just couldn't stop, you had to keep pushing me"", my uncle was playing the victim ""I don't know why you're yelling at me, i just asked you a question"". And then the accusations started, my mothers past with drugs, and nana's missing pills were brought up. after a particularly nasty comment about my mother from mike(i don't remember what he said exactly), i yelled, ""f\*\*\* you! we are all hurting but there is no excuse to be acting like this!"". I apologized to my cousins for swearing and they all left. My parents made it clear they would never forgive them for the things they said.

I guess i just want to know if me and my family are the jerks for being upset. i left some stuff out because of the character limit but if anyone has questions about what exactly was said, let me know!",3,1765222293.0,AmITheJerk,1,1.0,False

I’m 22M from Spain. I’m introverted in real life, practical and mostly logical. Most of the time I’m friendly and polite. I sometimes joke or act a bit dumb on purpose because it’s fun. I study computer science and AI. I’m atheist. I speak Spanish and English. I also don’t really use social media besides YouTube (if you can even call that social media) and Reddit.

I don’t have a huge list of hobbies. Mostly I watch YouTube videos or movies, read things from time to time, play video games sometimes, and study while listening to chill music with a cup of coffee or tea.

I’m looking for someone I can talk to regularly, by text or vc. I like deep conversations, but I also enjoy small everyday things. I prefer people who put some effort into conversations, someone who checks in now and then, asks how things are, or brings up random small topics.

2.  Judiciary with their colonial ways and chuttis. So many cases pending but holiday and summer break to hona he hai. 

3.	⁠Non accountability of Indians itself. Kyuki jab tak g@@d pe laath nahi padti, koi kaam nahi karta. Nobody has been ingrained with the sense of responsibility towards the country, bus survival mode. Desh prem buss dikhane ke lie. Vande Mataram gao cricket ground pe aur holiday jao bc Turkey Azerbaijan.

4.	⁠Lastly, humara civic sense. Ghar ke bahar sab dustbin hai bc, toh kaise desh saaf rahega? Range Rover mein gedi maro, but Starbucks ka coffee cup window roll down karke beech sadak me dalo. India mein unpadh gawar se jyada padhe likhe ch***ye hai.

1phlnmo,https://i.redd.it/1qyr9csp616g1.jpeg,Why I’m Ditching My MacBook for the Zephyrus G14 ?,"For years, the advice was simple: If you want to game, buy a PC. If you want to create, buy a Mac.

As a long-time MacBook Pro user, I lived by that rule. I loved the build quality, the trackpad, and the silence of Apple Silicon. But recently, that line has blurred. After spending time with the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, I’m doing the unthinkable: I’m shelving my MacBook Pro.

**Here is why the G14 is finally the Windows laptop that makes the switch worth it.**

**1. The Hardware Finally ""Feels"" Like a Mac**

The biggest barrier to leaving Apple has always been hardware envy. Most gaming laptops are plastic, creaky, and covered in ""gamer"" aesthetics.

The new G14 changes that. It features a CNC-milled aluminum unibody that feels just as rigid, cold, and premium as a MacBook. There is no flex. The ""Slash Lighting"" on the lid is subtle and stylish, not embarrassing to pull out in a coffee shop. It is sleek, professional, and shockingly thin (0.63 inches).

**2. OLED > Mini-LED**

MacBook Pros have incredible Mini-LED screens, but the G14’s 3K OLED panel is in a different league.

Contrast: Perfect blacks with zero ""blooming"" (the halo effect you see around white text on dark backgrounds on a Mac).

Speed: 120Hz refresh rate with 0.2ms response time makes motion clarity—whether scrolling a timeline or playing Call of Duty—instantly superior to the ""ghosting"" often found on MacBook Pro screens.

Colors: 100% DCI-P3 coverage means I can trust it for color grading just as much as my Apple display.

**3. The ""One Machine"" Dream**

With a MacBook, I always needed a second device (a console or a desktop PC) if I wanted to play games. The G14 is a true hybrid.

By Day: It’s a workhorse. The Ryzen processor crushes video editing, coding, and multitasking.

By Night: It runs Cyberpunk 2077 and Elden Ring at high settings. The ability to close Premiere Pro and instantly launch Steam on the same device is a level of freedom the Mac ecosystem simply cannot offer.

**4. Inputs That Rival Apple**

For years, Windows trackpads were awful. The G14’s trackpad is massive, glass-topped, and arguably matches the MacBook’s precision. The keyboard? It’s arguably better. With 1.7mm of travel, it feels tactile and deep compared to the shallower Magic Keyboard.

**The Compromises (What I Miss)**

It isn't a perfect victory. There are two things the MacBook still does better:

Battery Life: While the G14 is great for a Windows laptop (8-9 hours), the MacBook Pro can last 14+ hours on a single charge regardless of what I'm doing.

Fan Noise: The G14 is silent for web browsing, but launch a game or a render, and you will hear the fans. Apple Silicon stays whisper-quiet almost all the time.

**The Verdict**

The Asus Zephyrus G14 (2024) is the first Windows laptop that doesn't feel like a downgrade in quality. It offers the premium feel of a MacBook with the versatility of a high-end gaming PC.

For me, trading a few hours of battery life for the ability to play anything, anywhere, on a stunning OLED screen? That’s a trade I’m willing to make.",1,1765221957.0,BestGamingLaptop,0,1.0,False

I was just upped from 30mg to 40mg four days ago. I was on 30mg for one month and it went well, but every day was a guessing game whether it would work or not. Even with no socials/phone and getting right to productive chores in the morning.
*Right now* by biggest set back with 40mg is the excessive Irritability and impatience. I try SO HARD to not get irritated but I literally want to rage at everything. I also recognize that I need to give it a week or two to stabilize, so I'm trying to hang in there. 
For background, I'm a 25yo female and have ADHD inattentive type. I also have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis with hypothyroidism. I take birth control but skip the period, so luteal phase may not be the issue. I work 6a-6p shifts for a week, then I have a week off. So for a week I take my Vyvanse at 6am, then for a week I take it around 8am. I don't skip days. I also take methylated b12 a few times a week. 

Here's my current schedule:


Wake up 4:45am

Vyvanse 5:30am

Protein shake 6am

70mg elemental magnesium glycinate 

Snack with protein around 8am 

*This is where I start to get extremely irritable*

Water, water, water (and electrolytes) 

Lunch with protein around 12pm 

Iron + vitamin c and D3+K2 

Small cup of watered down coffee around 1pm (helps with the crash) 

Snack 3pm

Supper with probiotic 6pm

280mg elemental magnesium glycinate, iron, citalopram, birth control 

-I'm wondering if I need to add L theanine when I take my Vyvanse or when I start to get irritable. Also wondering if I should have a protein shake BEFORE taking the medication? L-Tyrosine made the irritation 100x worse!

jan 2024: i got off my vyvance ADHD medication due to the anxiety and sleep issues it caused me, and because i was on it for so many years i had massive fears i would gain weight, so i began doing workout classes every morning on an empty stomach with coffee. plus restricting my food (not tracking). i lost id say 5 pounds and weighed 130, I'm 5'4. i lost my period continuing this lifestyle for a year (didnt get a period from dec 2023 until jan 2025)

sept 2024: got spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis, rested recovered and ate whatever i wanted for 3 months, ended up gaining 15-20 pounds. felt large puffy and uncomfortable in my skin so i went on a weightloss journey in feb 2025

jan 2025: got 1 period (maybe from the weight i gained, maybe from the rest and finally letting myself eat)

feb 2025: started working with a fitness coach who told me she would help me 'heal my relationship with food'. working with her actually did the exact opposite as she made me eat 2000+ calories a day and track them all. it wasnt eating this but it was tracking it that really messed me up. also my fear of eating more than 1500 cals too. gained a few more pounds here.

mar-aug 2025: was so fed up i quit working with her and went on a weightloss journey, went back to all restrictive habits without realizing long term consequences. lost 15 pounds from mar-august, but i did it in an unhealthy way - i restricted, overexercised, intermittent fasted, avoided fats, weighed myself daily, avoided eating out, cancelled plans becuase of eating.. was really deep in my ED and was really struggling. i didn't get my period  from march to decmeber 2025. i was extremely depressed, anxious and the least happy ive ever been (even though i was at my smallest... funny how that works)

august 2025: got bloodwork and saw how scary low my estrogen & progesterone were. had a mental breakdown because i couldnt do this starving myself and weighing myself constantly anymore. i told myself I'm committed to healing for my future self. i want kids and i want to be healthy above all else. i want to feel free in my body and say yes to eating out without having an anxiety attack. i want to enjoy food and i just want my period back!!!

ANDDD 4 months later (yesterday) - i got my period!! it was funny because i didnt get too many symptoms before (just lots of CM which ive been getting since september ish). i noticed the week leading up to my period my CM was more white egg-whitey, and before that it was clear egg-white

now let me tell you about what i did (pls ask any q's i may have missed):

\- ate more, let myself eat. not overeat and binge (even tho yes that did happen for quite a while). i did not track. yes ppl say eat 2500+ calories, i personally dont think you need that if you are like me on the upper end of healthy weight range  
\- STOPPED ALL TRACKING - ALL WEIGHING MYSELF, MENTAL CALORIE MATH (when my mind would do it id yell in my head STOPPPP)  
\- ate 1 hr within waking (big for me)  
\- i still walked and did light pilates like 1x per week, but nothing else  
\- listened to my body, lots of rest, mindfulness, journaling - I'm super into spirituality whcih helped. i prayed that my period would come back and prayed for god to help me do whatever i can to help my body feel safe

but if i were to say:  
\- the biggest things for me were:

**1 remind my body shes safe to bleed and 2 get off this reddit forum. id sit here scrolling and compare myself to girls who didn't gain weight or who got their period back in 1-2 months. its not doable and only stresses the body more. everyone is different!!!!**

in all honesty, more than food, i think reminding your body she is safe again is the biggest piece here. over the last month ive been really honing in on it, and then it came. also this youtube video helped me dearly (its called training your mind to heal your body):

please lmk if any questions - happy to answer all :) love to you all <3

also i want to mention id watch HA recovery insta's and youtubers and i found they stressed my body out even more. remember everyone is so different and seriously comparison is the worst thig you can do on this journey",4,1765221707.0,Amenorrhearecovery,0,1.0,False

I know this won’t be everyone’s thing, but I’m proud of this collection and wanted to share it with the community. I was never really a “watch guy” until the last year or two, I fell down the rabbit hole with vintage pieces, played around modding a few Moonswatch reps, and then discovered a watch that really hooked me: the Seiko SRPD.

It’s a classic, endlessly customizable watch, and with a bit of work it becomes a surprisingly good homage to one of my all-time favorites, the Rolex GMT. Every one of these started as a Facebook Marketplace or eBay find, and I then upgrade them with domed crystals, bezels, dual-time inserts (since they aren’t true GMTs iykyk), crowns, and bands.

I know having ten versions of the same watch probably sounds ridiculous to some people, but for me, I love it. It’s fun picking whichever color/style matches my vibe for the day.

Watches listed:  
SRPD73 (Coke), SRPD53 (Pepsi), SRPD55 (Black), SRPD67 (Coffee), SRPD51 (Batman), SRPD76 (Root Beer), SRPD57 (Guinness), SRPD63 (Hulk), SRPD59 (OKC Thunder YM), SRPD79 (Blackout YM)

I’m planning to round the collection out with another ten and have already started on a few more. If this post gets any interest, I might follow up with a Part 2 once the next batch is finished.

I’m not looking to pack up and change cities, I’m here, I’m staying, and I’m committed to this state and this department, even on the days it feels like I’m holding the whole thing together with a frayed shoelace and a half-charged radio battery. And right now, we need more people who genuinely care.

If you’ve ever thought about joining law enforcement, if you’ve ever felt that pull that says you could make a difference, I want you to know something important:

**I will train you at your pace.**  
Not rushed, not thrown in the deep end, your pace.  
If you show up willing to learn, I will show up willing to teach, every step of the way.

This city is growing fast, calls are rising, and troopers are giving everything they have. And yes, I won’t sugarcoat it, we are stretched thin. This is the part where the little sorry-for-myself moment kicks in, because I could genuinely use a few more good people in uniform so I can stop stress-drinking six coffees before noon.

But in all seriousness…

SASP isn’t just a badge, it is a commitment to the people of this state.  
It is a chance to stand for something bigger.  
It is an opportunity to grow, serve, and join a team that actually cares.

So if you’re looking for a sign, this is it.  
**We could use you, the state could use you, and I am ready to help you become the trooper you are capable of being.**

Gosh... where to start...I think realized the kind of man I'm married to about 5 years ago after typing things he said and did into a Google search. Up popped narcissism and related topics like gaslighting, blame shifting, silent treatment etc
For years I've tried to ""fix"" our  relationship to no avail. We've gone to counseling...2 separate therapists advised that he seek individual therapy to work on his anger,triggers, etc BEFORE continuing couples therapy! So guess what... he didn't and therapy feels like a huge waste of time and $$. Except I did feel validated for the first time... probably ever in my life. ... My parents were both self absorbed, had alcohol issues and both neglected my needs growing up. I left home at 15. Years living paycheck to paycheck.  Worked most of my life. I now know i was an easy target for abusers. 
I've worked on myself to try to understand my attachment style, how to cope with my husband's consistent emotional neglect and abuse, applying the techniques recommended like grey rock, setting boundaries etc, meditating, you name it.

 But here I am today posting this because his random shut downs and then anger towards our new puppy yesterday simply sent me into a meltdown. I'm ashamed to admit i fell apart and my emotional state so bad I was swearing, yelling and smoked 2 cigarettes trying to cope. His crazy making verbal wars just break me down. He remains sooo icy sooo disdainful ... then I find myself doing exactly what I know I should never do... trying to get him to understand how he's hurt me or acknowledge that his behavior is inappropriate. Forget that. He used the usual... you're overreacting, you're acting crazy, you're over analyzing, you've got to much time on your hands to research all this psychological stuff, oh just leave me then, it's your fault you stay with me, if I'm really that bad then why do you stay, i didn't get a chance to comfort you when you cry, i don't feel loving towards you, i didn't feel like talking, and on and on. 

Why!?!! How did i end up engaged in that verbal whack a mole again?! Until I'm so angry, hurt and exhausted I don't even know what I'm saying anymore! 😢🫣😞
I want out. But ladies... please understand... how do i leave now ?...i mean if I were 36 and knew what I finally know now... I'd be outta here. But at 56? 
He has always worked so I've come to rely on his Healthcare benefits etc And my lord the cost of living is astronomical. We have a decent home close to our kids.  The fear of starting over at this age is real. I don't want to end up like many women I've met... struggling just to pay rent. 
I've find myself so alone. 
My 2 beautiful adult children are loving... but i cannot and will not burden them with our issues. I've no family... my parents each had multiple spouses, divorces etc 
I'm the scapegoat so i did sooo much chasing my family for love and acceptance for decades. To no avail... so much loss and estragements. No one i can rely on for support. never had a support system. 
I'm currently unemployed, I have no friends, except you know occasional lunch or coffee dates.
I try to connect at church, volunteer, groups... you name it. I try to reach out... connect. But
Everyone has their own established family connections and friendships. Especially at this age. 50s-60s.
I'm not saying this with self pity... but the simple truth is people simply don't need me in their circle. I'm not unliked... just unnecessary to their happiness. They already have established support networks. 
What do i do? How in the world do I survive in this marriage without emotional support? He's also very neglectful if I'm sick or injured. So I worry about what would happen to me if I truly became ill. A concern that becomes more real as I'm getting older. I'm lonely. I consider myself a strong, resilient person... positive and loving. But these last few years in becoming sadder and less hopeful.

Cuba is easily one of the most naturally beautiful places I’ve ever been to. The ocean is crystal clear, the water is bright blue, and the beaches look unreal. You can see fish swimming around even without snorkeling. On pure scenery alone, it’s a dream destination.

But once you leave the beach and look at daily life, the contrast is shocking.

The country strongly reminded me of China in certain ways — especially how ideology shapes everyday reality. There’s a saying that “only socialism can save humanity.” Cuba already has socialism, yet the people are clearly struggling. A local rep told us that many Cubans only earn around $20 CAD a month. Resort staff — bartenders, cleaners, servers — are considered “well off,” yet they work 12-hour shifts and are extremely grateful for even tiny tips by our standards. Many of them actually speak better French than most people in Toronto, which says a lot about how overqualified they are for the wages they earn.

We brought two full suitcases of clothes that we had saved over the years. Every time we met someone outside the resort, we felt the urge to give something. And then you realize the hard truth: there are simply too many people struggling, and no matter how much you give, you can’t fix the system itself.

We took an excursion into town and then to a small village by horseback. That’s when the reality really hit. Many areas suffer from severe electricity shortages. Even in the main town, the power follows a rotating schedule — electricity for a few hours, then blackout for a few hours. Some villages had no power at all. Even our hotel had several blackouts during our stay.

On top of that, a recent hurricane destroyed large parts of the banana, papaya, and coffee plantations — which wiped out a major source of income for many locals. Food shortages are real. At the resort itself, food choices were extremely limited, and Wi-Fi barely worked. This is not a luxury destination — it’s an experience destination.

The difference between Cuba and places like Cancun is night and day. In Cancun, everything is commercialized: nightlife, malls, international brands, easy credit card payments, online bookings, QR codes for excursions. In Cuba, we walked into local shops that were nearly empty. A few items had shockingly high prices clearly aimed at foreigners — prices that most locals could never afford. It’s not that people don’t want to buy; they simply can’t.

Tourism feels both essential and restricted at the same time. Cuba only really welcomes visitors from certain “friendly” countries, while missing out on the largest and closest potential market: the United States. If U.S. tourism were fully allowed, it would transform the economy almost overnight. Geographically and naturally, Cuba should be one of the top destinations in the world — but ideology blocks that future.

Some people point out that under socialism there is “no war.” That may be true. But peace alone doesn’t fill empty shelves, stock pharmacies, or give people political voice. Many people have no real say in how the country is run. That’s the part that feels most tragic.

Someone in our tour group joked that “Canada is becoming more like Cuba,” half joking — but the thought stuck with me. Cuba once had wealth due to natural resources, just like Canada does now. But instead of focusing on enriching everyday people, ideology took center stage. Once ideology dominates everything, people become secondary.

Cuba has every advantage:
	•	perfect climate
	•	beautiful beaches
	•	friendly, hardworking people
	•	prime location near the U.S.
	•	enormous tourism potential

And yet, so much opportunity is frozen in time because of politics and dictatorship. It feels like watching potential slowly decay.

I don’t hate Cuba. I actually wish more people could visit and see both the beauty and the reality. But visiting forces you to confront very uncomfortable truths about power, ideology, and who actually benefits from political systems.

If you’re going to Cuba, here’s what locals actually need (practical list):

Most vacation packages include one free checked bag. If you have space, these items genuinely help:

1. Cash (Extremely Important)

Bring physical cash only — there are no reliable ATMs near resorts.
	•	Canadian dollar bills preferred
	•	USD bills also accepted
	•	Cuban currency is unstable due to inflation

Locals accept loonies and toonies for tipping, and many staff will ask to exchange coins for paper bills, because:
	•	Banks do NOT accept coins
	•	Bills must be perfect condition (no wrinkles, folds, or tears)

Bring cash even if you plan to tip mostly with coins.

⸻

2. Clothes

Especially youth and kids’ clothes:
	•	T-shirts
	•	Shorts
	•	Light sweaters
	•	Kids clothing
Even gently used items are treasured.

⸻

3. Shoes

Cuba is not industrialized, so shoes are expensive on the black market.
	•	Sneakers
	•	Sandals
	•	Kids’ shoes
	•	Everyday walking shoes

⸻

4. Medicine (Huge need)

Before COVID, medicine was widely available. Now it’s “free” in theory but not available in reality.

Bring:
	•	Painkillers (Tylenol, Advil)
	•	Cold/flu meds
	•	Allergy meds
	•	Stomach medicine
	•	Antibiotic ointment
	•	Bandages
	•	Vitamins (especially kids’)

Everything now comes from the black market.

⸻

5. Feminine Products

Tampons and pads are extremely hard to find.
	•	Tampons
	•	Pads
	•	Pantyliners

⸻

6. Toiletries

Basic necessities are priced at foreigner rates:
	•	Shampoo
	•	Soap
	•	Toothpaste
	•	Toothbrushes
	•	Razors
	•	Laundry detergent

⸻

7. Toilet Paper (Very Practical Tip)

Public washrooms almost never have toilet paper, especially outside the hotel. And the local toilet paper that does exist is extremely low quality.

We brought our own roll on excursions.

Always carry:
	•	A small roll of toilet paper, or
	•	Tissues / wet wipes
in your backpack when leaving the resort.

It will save you.

I don’t have any friends. I go to school and put a big smile on my face. I’m friendly to everyone, they’re friendly back too.

I have no one to go to parties with or stay out late with just messing around and having fun. A lot of people my age look like they’re living the life, enjoying their teenage years. 

I’m always rotting in my bed, and trust me I try to enjoy time with myself. After school I go to a cafe to drink some coffee or eat some cakes. Walk around the city by myself and explore.

1phl4nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1phl4nx/guts_part_one_the_cabin/,GUTS - Part One: The Cabin,"The mysteries of the natural world have always intrigued me, with the flora and fauna that accompanies us upon the Earth. For all my four decades and some change, I have studied what I could manage. It was hard for a man of my stature, short and from elsewhere, the United States of America has never truly been terribly kind. I find myself oftentimes met by men of different breed stating that my own ideas were wrong and incorrect. They would laugh at me, ignoring that despite my name and face, I knew little about where they assumed I was from and had nothing much in common with the people there.

Admittedly, I did not help the matter with my determined realm of study. I fancied myself a cryptozoologist, and that merely made everything all the worse. So I began to document the things I have seen and the things I have done, and though my name, Javier Diaz, will never appear in any officially published letter, and my so-called amateurish insights will never be accepted by the masses, I am comfortable in the knowledge that I am correct in my mission, and I know without doubt that I am not crazy, nor insane. I have seen what crawls through the inky darkness of night, and I have seen what can steal the stars right out of the sky.

This unusual expertise of mine has led to my fortuitous position as a recognized expert in my chosen field. Students come to me, eyes bright and hearts full of questions and others come to me under another guise. They hide secrets behind the fear in their eyes, and have pictures, scribbles and drawings and the written scrawled whispers of rumors that they’ve followed, heard and seen. These people ask me for help, to correct the problems they face. They do not know what dangers lurk beyond the walls of their homes and they believe me capable.

Oh, I wish I was more capable.

When Marlene Brenner came to my office around evenfall, a feared look in her eyes and her face pale, I knew something was wrong. She smelled like gun oil and bath salts, and wore her night clothes, wrapped in a bath robe and still wearing her slippers.

“Madame,” I pleaded as she barged her way into my office as I opened the door. Tears streaked her face, and she collapsed on the couch along one end of my room, her head in her hands, her raven black hair covering her face. She sat there for a long moment, taking in long shuddering breaths in the gathering darkness. “Are you alright?” I asked, stealing a look at the street outside.

My office was part of a small strip mall on Main Street in the town of Ennis, Montana, which was small and pitiful and mostly known as a through-way to Yellowstone or the more well-known Virginia City. It was a pit stop, and because of its nature as one, it often collected the strangest sorts. Old couples lived here, to finish out the golden years of their lives, and Californians and New Yorkers came to build condos for young couples that would never show up. Peering through the windows of my office, I could see an old truck parked haphazardly on the curb. Its brights were on, yellow light blazing a path up the boardwalk to my door, like a beacon, showing the way.

“Something,” the woman finally said after minutes of silence. “Something is hunting us.” She looked up, handing me a photograph. I took it and turned the lamp on my desk to get a better view. The image was dark and confusing, shapes seemingly moving in the shadows around the picture of a quaint cabin.

“Madame, I assure you, I do not understand.” I said at last, handing the photo back. Marlene hiccupped out a sob and shook her head, pushing the photo back towards me. “What is it?” I asked. She wiped tears from her eyes and attempted to compose herself. Her emotions now under control, she regained her breath and stood to her full height, which unsurprisingly was taller than me.

“My name is Marlene Brenner, and we need your help, Doctor Diaz.” She said, her voice full of fear stamped down by a quiet resolve. “Something is stalking us, it has already taken one of our dogs and my husband and I fear for ourselves, and more importantly, our children.” She tipped her head towards the door. “We would like you to come to our home and see for yourself.”

“Ma’am,” I started, but she held up a finger, telling me to be silent.

“We will pay whatever is necessary, but we need your help, doctor.” The look in her eyes spoke the truth well enough, and though I knew better in any other way, I relented and allowed her to take me to their cabin, nestled to the north, under the watching eyes of Sphinx Mountain. The truck was small, perfectly suited to a family that builds their home in the mountains and tries to use it as little as possible. It was very nearly falling apart and clearly could use some love and care. It lurched forwards violently every time Marlene used the shifter, and I felt like the wheels were only a few bumps from flying off the axles.

It took upwards of forty-five minutes to get to the cabin in the woods. I stepped out of the almost warm cab of the truck and my boots crunched into the dry leaves and gravel of the driveway. My breath floated out into cold fall air, and I wrapped my jacket a little tighter around myself, gaining my bearings. The cabin was modest, built by hand and made well. It sat in a clearing of trees, alone against the gathering dark. The sun had almost fully set, and Marlene was ushering me with haste through the front door.

I walked up the steps to the porch, my case in one hand, and entered the house. The warmth inside was pleasant, and not overly hot. It was well lit, and Marlene’s husband sat on the couch in the living area, staring intently on a rifle laid out in parts in front of him, like he was trying to will it back together with his mind. Marlene shut the door behind us, and I heard the clicking of multiple locks, and saw from the bay window as she shut off the porch light. She quickly drew the curtains on the window, tight and secure, and sat on the couch beside her husband, taking his hand in hers.

I looked around the room for a moment. It betrayed itself, speaking of a life well lived and full of love. The interior had a few mounted trophies, no doubt from the families’ own hunting prowess, and I could see children’s toys, laying on their sides all around the living room. A dog lay, alert, by the front door. He was a German shepherd, and the collar around his neck read ‘Captain’. There was a dog bed next to Captains, and that one was empty, save for a collar hanging on a hook on the wall above it, with the name ‘Bucky’ engraved. I turned, sitting down in a chair set across from the Brenner’s.

“I’m aware that you know who I am.” I said, setting my case down at my feet and leaning forwards, steepling my fingers. The house may have been nice, but the subtle stench of rot did indeed hang in the air, like a ghost, waiting for its moment to strike. “And your wife,” I pulled the photo out of my pocket and placed it on the coffee table. “Gave me this. I don’t know what to make of it, but I am certain you can tell me.” I nodded my head towards the husband. It took a moment, but he looked up.

The fear in his eyes was electrifying. It surpassed the fear in the eyes of his wife. The husband picked up the photo, looking it over. “My name’s David.” He said, placing the photo back down. “It’s not a good picture, but the thing is there.” He pointed to an oddly shaped shadow at the edge of the image. “One of our trail cams, we have one pointed towards the house, got the picture a week ago. It was the morning our dog, Bucky, went missing.” I leaned forwards, peering at the image.

The numerous pixels and dark edges of the photo seemed to merge, but as I focused, I thought I saw something pale in the darkness, sneaking into the trees. It was large. I picked the photo up for closer inspection, and David continued.

“I went looking every night for Bucky, but I couldn’t find him.” He paused. “Until yesterday.” His eyes seemed to glaze over as he lost focus, staring at the empty dog bed and the collar that hung above it.

“What did you find?” I asked after a moment of hesitation, not truly wanting to know a definitive answer to the question but knowing that I had to ask. If I did not, then we may never get this family out of this strange nightmare they believed they were living.  I placed the photo back in my jacket as I listened to David.

“I found him.” David said softly. “Hanging, a few miles up the mountain, in the BLM.” His voice broke for a second. “He… he was hanging and eviscerated.” He wiped his face, staring into empty space. “It was like someone had field dressed him. All that was left was just wet skin, hanging from a noose made of sinew and guts.” David met my eye with a grim look. “A pile of bones were under the skin, broken. It looked like someone had sucked the marrow right out.” He sighed, looking down at his hands. “I had that dog since I was a boy.” He said softly. Marlene placed her hand on his arm.

“He buried him out back,” she explained. “But,” a pause. “But something dug it up and took the corpse. All we had left was the collar.” She looked back at the empty bed and the collar hanging on the wall. I nodded, jotting down a few notes in a tattered leather-bound book I always kept on me. I closed it, latching it shut, tracing the embossing on the front. Two dragons, caught in eternal battle. I allowed my mind to wander for a moment, to things I have seen in dark forests like these.

Crawlers, along trees and buildings, feasting on sadness. The Striders, bringing mist and a chilling cold. The Eat. I wiped my eyes, rearranging my glasses in the process. I was not doing myself, nor these fine folk, any good by dwelling on something like that. I looked up and nodded again, my expression grave.

“So, you wish for my assistance, in discovering this thing?” I asked. David nodded.

“We have a guest room. You can stay with us for a few days, find out what is out there.” He offered. I held up a hand and shook my head. I was not one to impose my presence upon others, especially families, even when they offered such kindness.

“I can sleep outside, in my tent or the truck, if necessary, I assure you.” I said. David let out an exasperated sigh, shaking his head into his hands.

“No.” He said with not a small degree of finality. I was taken aback by the tone of voice he used, as it was definitive and a little commanding.

“Pardon?” I asked, leaning in. David looked up, his eyes dark.

“We’re safe in the house. You’ll be a target if you’re outside.” He insisted, gesturing to an open door down the hall behind me. I turned, looking at the dark doorway that led into what I assumed was the guest room. “We need your help, doctor. Please, stay with us.” I sighed and nodded.

“Fine. Fine. I assure you I will be pleasant company for your family and will not get in the way.” I said, standing. David stood and we shook hands, firmly in the way that men do. David seemed like a gentle soul, and the pain I could see in his eyes and hear in his voice seemed to cut him deeper than any blade. I had only seen a man in such a state a few times, and often in the mirror. I bade them goodnight and picked up my case. My room was small and had only a chest of drawers and a bed. It smelled stale, but not in a bad way. It had the scent of sheets that were washed but had been unused for months. The window curtains were closed as well. Curious, I opened them a crack, peering out into the dark.

Was it my imagination, or my eyes playing tricks? Did I truly see what I believe I saw out there, lurking among the trees? My heart hammered at my ribcage, and I closed the blinds, taking a moment to breath. Whatever was out there, I was certain I could handle it. These things are usually non-threatening, and when they are they merely require a change in attitude. I shuttered my lights and closed my door. I sat on the edge of my bed, my journal in my hands, and closed my eyes, working through the raging thoughts in my mind. I returned to the possibilities I had been exploring earlier.

Crawler? No. They usually inhabit more populated areas and while they do prefer the cold, and God knows it was cold in Montana, there was simply not enough emotion here to draw them out. Striders were too large and simply did not travel this far south. The only one I had ever seen was in Canada, on its way through to Alaska after all. My mind wandered on to other things, other monsters I may have seen in the dark, what else had I even documented? The Eat? I shuddered at the thought and almost turned the lights back on, but I knew better. My associate liked the dark, and I did not mind its company. I could see it, in the corner of my eyes. That dark shape, lingering just out of view, feeding on whatever sorrow I still had.

The Eat. I knew it was not this, I knew its modus operandi, but I also knew that my fear outweighed my reason and in an ill-advised attempt to comfort myself, I opened the curtains of my window. The moonlight bled in, silver in the dark. I paused for a moment, holding onto the curtain and looking out the cold glass, my breath fogging it slightly as I peered into the dark. I could see something. Something was out there, definitively, moving about like some kind of stop-motion puppet.

The shape was something I could not define, but it put to rest my worries of this being an occurrence of the Eat. That was a shadow among shadows and this was something pale, naked and wet. It seemed to be pacing in the tree line, then after a moment, I could see it stop. Branches, naked from fall, moved out of the way as something pressed itself through the tree line and took its first step into the clearing. I knew it was nonsense, but I felt as if I could hear the leaves crunch under its heavy step.

The thing started to walk into the clear moonlight. Its body was pale, naked and almost human. Its stomach was distended, and its flesh was covered in welts and blood- and pus-filled pimples and pustules. My breath caught in my throat as I slowly pulled the curtain back over the window. “That was unwise.” I said to myself once the darkness had enveloped my room once more. I lay down, and tried to close my eyes, forcing myself to find sleep.

It did not come.

But I could hear the thing outside. I felt exposed, like I was lying out under the stars and not inside a building. The house was sturdy, and it could not enter, but I could hear it walking around the perimeter, its feet crunching in the leaves. This lasted hours, and only then was I able to find my rest.

It should be common knowledge that in the profession of ‘monster hunter’ (a moniker I abhor as it insinuates that monsters are things that need to be killed or can be killed at all when in my experience that’s an impossible task) one becomes very experienced with night terrors, sleep paralysis and nightmares. I was not someone unique in the fact that I was plagued with all three. Constantly.

That night was no different, as it was a nightmare I was comfortable with, but it sparked unease in me regardless. It started normally, with me standing at the edge of a cliff, looking out over the ocean. I was somewhere in Iceland, and I could almost smell the fresh breeze and feel the cold air against my face. Next to me stood a man, who was holding a book, and he wouldn’t stop laughing. His face was torn, so that his head was more of a naked skull than a human face. I could hear no joy in his laugh as it grew louder and louder, and suddenly the cold air grew hot and warm. The man seemed to be engulfed in flames.

I screamed out in pain as I watched the fire reach the water and it seemed like the entire ocean was ablaze. I watched my hands, turning them as my flesh flaked away and my bones were charred black.

I woke up with a start, a heavy feeling in my chest, like I was being pinned down. I couldn’t catch my breath as I tried desperately to move. My limbs would not budge, as I was locked in place. I tried to take a deep breath, but it was like I had rocks sitting on my lungs, keeping pressure and making it almost impossible to breathe in. The terror lasted only a moment and ended when I noticed the shadow at the foot of my bed. I sat up, free of my paralysis, and glanced around. My associate had left, taken what it needed and vanished. I knew it’d be back; it always was. Part of me had grown accustomed to its presence and I felt very alone without it.

“Not alone.” I assured myself. “Never alone.” I turned and opened the curtains, letting the light of mid-morning flood into my room. With a groan I stood, stretched and got dressed. I exited my room to enter a much happier house than I had experienced last night. I could hear the clicking of a dog’s claws as Captain, the great German shepherd, ran to and fro, playing with Brenner’s daughter, who looked about six years old. Their son, about eight, sat at the table. Both children took more after their mother than their father, but the daughter had her father’s curly red hair.

“Ah, you’re awake.” David said, a smile on his face. I could tell it was forced, a mask for his children. Part of me wanted to urge him to be honest and open with them now and tear the mask away because they certainly knew something was wrong. “Children, this is an old family friend, Doctor Javier Diaz.” He said, introducing me to the kids. I learned then that the girl was Bailee and the boy was Seth, and I joined the family at the breakfast table.

“Are you here for the monster?” The boy asked me in a hushed whisper, glancing over at his parents. David glanced up, concern on his face.

“Seth-“ He said. I held up a hand.

“It’s alright David.” I picked up my fork and cut into my pancakes. “What monster?” I asked. Seth looked ashamed almost, turning away and playing with a rogue strawberry on his plate.

“I’ve never even seen it.” The boy said. “But I have heared it, outside.” He pointed to the windows. “It sounds big.” I shook my head, taking a bite.

“There’s no monster, Seth.” David said. Marlene looked between us, worried. I nodded.

“Your father is right, Seth.” I said. “Just some coyotes, wandering around.” Seth narrowed his eyes and furrowed his brows.

“I know what a coyote sounds like, mister.” He said. “And it’s not one of those.” We ate our breakfast in silence, and when we were finished, I helped the parents collect the plates while the children wandered off to their room to get properly dressed.

“You shouldn’t be hiding this from them.” I said as I placed the plates in the sink. David glanced at me, putting the ingredients away in the fridge.

“They don’t need to know what’s out there, not yet.” He said, finishing up.

“I can’t tell you how to parent,” I said, “but they know something is wrong.”

“You said you wouldn’t get in the way.” David reminded me, turning, his eyes dark. I held up my hands, apologetic.

“I apologize.” I said. “David, you and I should venture into the forest today, before it gets dark.” I said, changing the subject. He nodded and I turned away to gather my things. The children ran past me to their parents as I walked into my room and shut the door. I opened my case and removed my equipment. It wasn’t a lot, just a few simple things that I have found useful over the years. Some medical grade facemasks, a pair of leather gloves, a pair of latex gloves, a heavy metal flashlight, a bundle of dice made from knuckle bones (reasonably sourced I assure you, but yes, they are human) and a knife. I wrapped myself in my jacket and pulled on my gloves, grabbing my trail hat as I left the room.

“You’re the man of the house, Seth.” David said as I entered the main room. “You gotta protect your mom and your sister, alright?” His voice was grave, and I could see that Seth understood the gravity of what that meant. What world do we live in that eight-year-olds must shoulder such burden? I often wonder if we grow too fast, or if the world around us is too dangerous for our own good. I adjusted my gloves as I stood, a little awkwardly, to the edge of the room.

When David had finished giving his son his mission, he stood and came to me, a rifle in one hand and a shotgun in the other. He offered the former to me, holding it out. I looked at it for a moment, considering. I imagined the feel of it in my hands, familiar after all this time away from such tools of death and destruction. I was almost tempted to take it, to wield it against the dark. How well had that gone before? A few broken bones for me, a hole in the wall, and the thing I shot at laughing at me. I buried the thought and shook my head, denying the offered weapon.

“I’ll do fine on my own.” I assured him. David arched an eyebrow. “And with you as my bodyguard, I have never been good with firearms and fear if I were to carry it, it may accidentally go off in the wrong direction.” David relented and slung the shotgun over his own shoulder. He was bringing a veritable arsenal with us, as he had his two long guns and a pistol at his hip. In contrast, I seemed woefully unprepared, carrying only my knife at my side.

David let out a sharp whistle and Captain’s ears perked up. “Here boy!” The dog leapt to his feet and made his way over, standing still at David’s side. He gave his wife a short kiss goodbye, and we were out the door, stepping into the cold fall air. I shivered slightly, more from apprehension than cold, as we made our way to the tree line.

“You saw it last night?” I asked, finally breaking the fragile cold silence between us with a breath of warm air. David sighed, nodding.

“It comes to the house every night, I think.” He muttered, picking his way through the brush as we broke through the first few feet of the tree line. “Usually from different directions in the trees, trying to stop us from finding where it comes from, I think.” He pointed to a trail cam set up about twelve feet on a tree nearby. “So we set trail cams. I had them set lower, but it kept taking them down, so we put them a bit higher, trying to catch sight of it. See where it comes from.”

“Any luck?” I asked, stepping wide over a fallen dead branch and trying not to trip on an uprooted tree trunk. I hopped a bit to regain my balance and continued to follow David through the dark forest. It was early afternoon, and so by all rights the sun should be beating down on us, but the thick pine tree cover and the heavy dark aura of terror between us kept that light away. It was a shame, because I would have liked to feel its warm rays bathe me aglow, and keep my heart a little more hopeful.

“No.” David said, curtly, after a moment of thought. “We’ve seen glimpses, pieces here and there, but never the thing in totality.” He ducked under a branch, then pulled it out of the way for me. I walked passed, and he let the branch swing back into place. “But, I remember where it left Bucky, so that’s where I’m taking you.” He said. I nodded.

“I thought as much.” We made out way through the trees and onto a small game trail. There was enough space to walk single file through the forest. The path twisted in on itself and wound back and around the trees multiple times. The course was so erratic and twisting that I lost my bearings more than once. The hairs on the back of my neck wouldn’t calm down, and a prickling sensation trickled all the way from my scalp to my toes. I felt like something was watching us. Occasionally, I’d hear the odd heavy footfall, and the sound of something heavy dragging through dead leaves. Yet when I looked, the forest would be as dark and as empty as ever.

The truly strange thing was the complete lack of sound. I was used to the chirping of birds, the calling of various mammals and the skittering of bugs and rodents, but there was nothing but a dead, creaking silence that was occasionally punctuated by the wind clacking dry tree branches together above us. Every sound made me jump, and the silence made those moments of feeling watched all the worse. What was out there that would empty a forest of life?

Finally, David stopped cold in his tracks, his neck craned up to the trees. I stopped next to him, looking up. Bits of sinew were still hanging on the branch, cut at the ends, where David had removed Bucky’s corpse.

“He was here.” He said, his voice quiet. “Hanging, all alone.” I let him sit in the silence for a moment as I explored the area. The air was cold and sharp, and nothing smelled unusual, but I could hear something up in the trees. Turning my head up, I squinted, trying to catch sight of anything moving up there. Then I saw it. It looked like a windchime, sitting in the tree, made of bone. It was gently clinking together, making small, hollow ‘tink’ noises. I noticed that in the bone were carvings and holes etched into it, causing each blow of the breeze to cause the chimes to whistle slightly.

“Mister Brenner,” I said, breaking the man out of his depressed stupor. He turned, a question in his eyes. Before he could speak, I pointed one gloved finger up at the chimes, about ten feet above us, hanging from a branch. He followed my direction, tipping his head curiously at the sight. “I believe,” I said, “that whatever this creature is, has been decorating the borders of its territory.”

“You think Bucky was a warning?” He asked. I nodded. This behavior was common among animals, bears would mark and scent trees that bordered their territory, and clearly this creature was smart enough to mark its own territory. Perhaps the way it did it was gruesome, but in the end the effect was the same.

“Perhaps it thinks you are on its territory.” I offered. “And Bucky was likely a warning for you to stay away.” David frowned, his hand on his rifle, and his eyes deep in thought. He paced for a moment, the crunch of his feet in the leaves and needles putting me on edge.

“I’ve lived here for twelve years.” He said, finally, turning towards me. “I won’t let this thing drive me from my home.” He seemed to decide something with himself and set forwards, Captain warily following him deeper down the trail.

“Mister Brenner!” I called turning. I knew this was a bad idea, and we should turn and probably run away as fast as we were able, but David clearly did not have the same reservations as I did. “David!” I called out. The man stopped, shadowed under the trees, his eyes full of menace. Something inside of me grew frightened more of him than the thing lurking out here.

“I plan to kill this thing, Doctor Diaz. And you will not stand in my way.” He growled out. I was clearly right to be afraid. I held out a hand, showing peace.

“I’m not saying we can’t.” I said, slowly. “I want to make that clear. This thing is dangerous, but we need to understand our situation more. Let us head back to your home and make a real plan that we can action without any danger coming back to your family.” David opened his mouth to refute but I cut him off. “David. If you attack that thing now, unprepared and full of rage and hate, and you do not kill it dead, it will kill you, then attack everything you love.”

Finally, he relented, coming back into the light at my side. “Fine. I don’t like this though.” He said. I nodded in agreement.

“Neither do I.” I turned towards the tree, squinting back up at the wind chime. I noticed that more were threaded through the trees, like some kind of macabre fence of singing bone. I jumped as a yipping filled the silent air and the branches and leaves underfoot crackled. I turned, and so did David, only to come face to snout with a small gray fox. It’s ears twitched and it turned, bounding away and yapping and calling in the strange way that foxes do.

I shook my head with a chuckle and took a firm grip on the tree. I started to climb, to get a better look at the bone chimes above us. When I came into view, I took out my notebook and carefully sketched what I could see. The bone was a fair distance from the ground, but I could make out the vague shape of what was carved on the chimes themselves.

It seemed to tell a story. It depicted a large humanoid creature with distinct reptilian features making its way through a waterlogged swamp, then through a door, and then through the mountains, this time that same reptilian creature seemed to be thinner and weaker, and the flesh of its face had fallen off. Undaunted, I finished my drawings and notes and was about to make my way down the tree when I froze. There was something in the trees around us, I could hear a raspy, breathy kind of wheezing coming from underneath me.

“Do you hear that?” I called down to David as I started to move again, carefully placing my feet on thick branches, climbing slowly down the side of the tree. He nodded, staying silent. I hit the ground and brushed loose needles off my clothes, glancing around us. The day was dying, and night would set upon us sooner rather than later.

Then I heard something else in that darkness around us, within the trees. I heard the distinct and horrible sound of frantic scared yipping and the horrible, awful sound of something breaking bones and the scream of a far-off animal dying. David and I froze, and Captain turned, growling into the dark. David lifted his rifle, trying to pierce the dark with his eyes. I pulled my light from my belt and flicked it on. The yellow beam of bright light cut through the dark, lighting the trees and throwing their long, hand-like shadows across the forest around us. I squinted into the dark, swinging the light carefully from side to side.

“We need to leave.” I whispered. “How far are we from the cabin?” I asked.

“Roughly three hundred yards.” David whispered. I swore under my breath. If there were no trees, I would have been more confident, but the confusing, twisting landscape of a forest on the mountain made three hundred feet a lot harder to get through, not to mention three hundred yards, especially since we were reaching the end of the game trail we had followed to get as deep as we did. We were losing light, and I was losing hope.

I moved the light back through the trees, my breath ragged. I tried to slow my erratic heartbeat by trying to take a few deep breaths, breathing in deep through my nose. The stench of the air round me almost made me gag and throw up, however. It was a sudden and horrible kind of smell that seemed to come right out of the rot of corpses and several day-old entrails. It was a stench I had only caught in war, and never in the field of research I now favored. David covered his nose in disgust and Captain whimpered, taking a few steps back.

The air had grown hot and wet, and it felt like grease was being applied directly to the inside of my lungs as I started to back out of the trees, following David as we started to move again, trying to get out of the forest. I heard something creaking behind me and cautioned a glance, swinging my flashlight around to meet the brief sight of something moving in the trees.

It almost caused me to fall to the ground.

There was something following us, and it was bigger than I had ever thought. I didn’t catch a good sight of it, but recounting this now, I wish I had seen it more then, so I didn’t have to suffer the sight of it properly later. The brief amount I did see was pale and peach colored, like raw human skin, and it was covered in sores. I saw its hand, its horrible, horrible hand, with seven long fingers, almost as long as my entire forearm, as it held tight to a tree before quickly disappearing into the dark.

Panic now well and truly set in my heart, David, Captain and I made our way through the dense brush and finally into the clearing. We did not stop there, as we could hear the twigs and leaves crunching and snapping behind us as something heavy moved through them. We only stopped as the door to the cabin shut behind us and we locked it. Marlene looked up in surprise from her place within the kitchen, and the children glanced up from their books on the couch. The room was silent for a moment as David and I caught our breath and Captain lay, cowering, on his bed. I glanced out the window, pulling the curtain back for a peek out at the dark and jumped back in surprise.

An eye was pressed to the glass, staring at me. It was large and pale, as if someone shoved a balloon into the empty eye socket of a skull. It sagged and seemed to be lit up with a ghastly flame. The eye quivered as the thing on the other side pressed itself closer to the glass, its breath fogging the window. I quickly closed the blind and turned back towards the family. I looked at the children, then at the parents.

“It’s outside.” I said softly.

“What’s outside?” Seth asked, looking up at us.

“Nothing, baby.” Marlene said softly, wiping her hands on her apron and walking to her son, meeting him on his level. She wiped a strand of black hair from his eyes. “We’re going to be fine.”

“Famously,” I said, adjusting my jacket. “Things tend to get worse when we say that.”",1,1765220769.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1phl4dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1phl4dn/tipping_has_gotten_out_of_hand_in_america/,Tipping has gotten out of hand in America,"Servers/waiters/etc forget what a tip is…it’s for going extra to make the customer’s experience better

Many are rude and clearly hate their jobs and act like it’s their god given right for a customer to give a 20% tip. 

Example: 
A guy at Ike’s sandwiches takes your order. His face looks like the cartoon droopy aka he clearly looks unhappy and doesn’t want to work there when he takes your order and he asks you want lettuce tomato jalopeno. You say yes everything. he says it will he $13 or whatever it is. Then after you pay he conveniently reminds you please fill take time to fill out the next screen. The next screen is tip and the tip options are 15,18, and 20%. 

He thinks I should give him a tip? He just took my order and didn’t do anything else…what a joke- but this is a reflection of the American service industry and it’s disgusting obsession with tipping 

Did he smile? Did he try to be extra friendly? Did I customize this order in such a way that he had to do a lot of extra work? No…why the fuck does he expect I should tip? I’ve seen better service elsewhere and they’re not this tip tip tip nonsense 

A 15/18/20 percent tip is for someone who comes to my table, refills my water, is very available should I want to order more or need my check, etc. and the 15 is for someone who does that and clearly hates his job and 20 is for someone who makes your experience pleasant 

This isn’t exclusive to Ike’s. This happens  at ice cream parlors, Starbucks, other coffee shops, and a lot of places. If people like him act so entitled to tips, customers are going to lose interest in coming to such places 

And in some ways this is happening- people aren’t going to Starbucks as much as before…and it’s because of the bad customer service and I’m sure the tip prompt adds to it indirectly ",42,1765220752.0,Adulting,61,0.85,False

I end up relaxing a bit too much though once I’m feeling good again & accidentally making myself ill. Very frustrating. Anyways, I would love to hear your go to meals or snacks for ideas. Here’s my typical: 

Sourdough English muffin (the ones in the fridge section of the grocery) toasted with butter & black cherry jam + side of kefir 

Egg cooked in butter with English muffin, sometimes cheese. 

Chunks of block cheddar cheese with fruit like grapes or blueberries

Homemade bread made with Italian 00 flour (I order it online, recipe I use is super simple lmk if you’d like it). I freeze it in slices & toast them to top with butter throughout the week. 

Fairlife milk smoothies, typically just bananas & strawberries + milk & sometimes kefir.

My three dinners I cycle through are:

1.) Basic sushi rice dish, like stir fry using basic sushi rice cooked in rice cooker. Then combined with frozen veggie mix, Trader Joe’s onion powder, & coconut aminos, once getting close to crispy I add more butter to the pan & cook two eggs in the middle. 

2.) potato & leek soup made with bone broth & blended with an emersion blender. Topped with salt, pepper, sour cream & I toast bread with butter & dip it in there. Yum. 

3.) chicken & gravy with potatoes. 

I do coffee with a lot of cream or milk everyday too & make it in a pour over. I’ve found for me that works well but if I have coffee out of a metal carafe like at work or something - I’ll be miserable rather quickly. 

Love to hear your favorites & methods that work for you all. Hope you’re all having a good start to your week!

But thankfully, now that I've got my hands freed up, I thought I'd have a little outing with our favorite little gremlin, Tokai Teio! Get your dancing shoes and black coffee ready because this is gonna be a fun one! Teio-steppu, away!\~♪

I was actually at Tracen's reception, deep in conversation with Tazuna and Riko, when I felt a strong tugging on the back of my sweater. As I swept around, both shock and curiosity washed over me, and Teio's radiant smile and sky-blue eyes stared back at me with a look of expectation. The cuteness came out with a soft chuckle, and I lent Teio a pat on the head and asked her what her business was.

""You're that hangout reviewer guy, right?! Doto-san and Taiki-san told me all about you!♪ Can we go out? Pleeease?♪""

Teio looked adorable in her school outfit; the periwinkle, dark blue, and white swishing fabric against the soft wind took all of my attention, like the sprinting front runner of a race. Perhaps this is what it was like being in the presence of an Uma who gave it her all, one who dared to take on Rudolf's image. Appreciative of the girl's brazenness, I quickly apologized to Riko and Tazuna before being dragged about the grounds of Tracen by the energetic gremlin.

The conversation with Hachimi-san as we walked through the quaint city was as jumpy as her Teio steps. However, one thing definitely remained constant...

""Rudolf said my outfit looks like something she'd wear when she was young! Can you believe it?! She also said...""

Her obsession with Rudolf - her likes, dislikes, and infinite stream of commendations - seemed to come out of Teio like rain from the sky. Although her voice eventually blurred as I absorbed the sounds of streetside convo and the ringing of bike bells, it took me a good couple of seconds to notice that Teio was tugging at my sleeve again. I'd zoned out for a good 30 seconds, but the ever-observant disciple of Rudolf seemed to catch on in a squick.

As I looked back at Teio, I made a casual notion that seemed to shatter her whole world..

She'd forgotten to change her outfit.

That one comment set her into a swirl of emotions, her high-pitched squeals of despair reaching the very limits of my healing. In the confusion as I tried to console her, she set her hands down on my shoulders and swayed me back and forth in an almost cartoonish way.

""Why didn't you tell me sooner?! What'd Rudolf say if she saw me like this?! How did I forget this time!!""

When Teio stilled her rocking, I lent her a reassuring hand to softly ruffle her hair. Reassurances and compliments of her effort ensued while I took the disgruntled maiden in my arms. Shockingly enough, she was docile - her only movement being the slow breathing after a high-energy tantrum. I offered to walk Teio back to her dorm, and she raised her head from my chest and obliged in a calm and steady tone.

The walk back was silent, but that wasn't in any way a bad thing. The high-octane afternoon of keeping up with Teio had visibly worn me down, and now the world felt more vibrant as the sun slowly painted oranges and pinks against the backdrop of our outing. Teio seemed to take notice of the now dim lighting, and she took the chance to shoot me a glance.

The light of the sun was, simply put, beautifully scattered in Tokai Teio's eyes - like the stars of the night sky shining joyfully against the vast emptiness of space. I suppose Teio made me feel that way, too - how her nonsense conversations and endless gluttony for praise were meant to be a sort of reminder that she could keep going.

That she could, perhaps one day, reach the same stardom as her senpai. She looked at me curiously, mouth slightly open as if preparing to ask me a question. In that moment, we locked gazes, and a particularly strong beam of light shone against us both. It made Teio's eyes glow with a mix of yellow and blue, and in that moment, I saw her smile - not one of cheekiness as was all too familiar with her, but one of affection and lifelong bonding. She was enjoying this, and so was I - and against the gentle rays of light, who could blame us?

Once we'd made it to her home, the sun had finally set - rather quickly, yes, but it was barely noticeable after Teio had enlightened my world once more. Fixing back to the task at hand, she swiftly changed to her regular clothing - admittedly disappointed that she'd forgotten, but after a bit of egging her on, it seemed to bother her little.

Noticing my own exhaustion hitting me like a tidal wave, I made for the nearest soft and pillowy object - a futon that sat before a TV set and everything else you'd expect. As I met its soft embrace, I saw Teio snuggle up beside me, evidently exhausted of all her energy. In that moment, my exhaustion in tandem with the newfound admiration I grew for Teio, made me pull her in for a hug.

Teio gasped, as red as an apple, but not wanting to be outdone, pulled me up to sit. As I rubbed the sleepiness out of my eye, she adamantly got into my lap, legs pressing against either side. She then proceeded to take my hand, intimately interlocking fingers, and finally resting her free hand on my chest with an almost supernatural gentleness. Adrenaline welled up inside me, washing away my tiredness like blue waves on a sandy shore.

In that moment, I surrendered myself to the great Tokai Teio as she pulled me in for a kiss.

**FINAL VERDICT:** 10/10. Teio is a sweetheart and a hard worker at that. Although she's admittedly tiring at times, it's an honest reminder of the trials and various efforts that shaped the strong-voiced chaser into who she is. I'm sure that there were many emotions that she's had to hold in - from winning the Arima Kinen on a broken leg to her endless quest to outshine Symboli Rudolf. Although she may not be as elegant as Gentildonna, as endearing as Super Creek, or as smart as Tachyon, Teio has certainly stepped her way from the sky into my heart.",12,1765220611.0,okbuddyumamusume,2,1.0,False

* [Intro - Start of Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TCZm_nIZFU&t=1029s) - Initial Comments by Mikael.

**Start of State of Dev Portion**

* [State of Dev - Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eemtf_V67WU) - Opening comments by Mikael

* [State of Dev - Console Patches & Crashes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eemtf_V67WU&t=43s) - Mikael starts a long discussion (22 Minutes) about state of Consoles, to include the release of Console Patches, and what they are doing about Console game crashes.

   * They ARE reading all the reports of Console crashes on the [Satisfactory Q&A Website](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/search?sort=1).

   * Consoles can only be updated in ""batches"" and not as individual patches. This means that it may take longer for patches to be released.

   * They have fixed most of the major crashes, most notably **Crossplay / Multiplayer Crashes**, based upon a ""priority system"".

   * [**They need detailed Q&A Posts from Console Players.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eemtf_V67WU&t=568s) - Since Console players can't send in save files they need as much detailed information as possible about what is happening, to include what Tier Level you are in, what you were building when crash occurred, are you doing a single-play session, or multi-player session, etc., will greatly help in finding and eliminating bugs/issues.

* [State of Dev - Q&A: How often has CSS been releasing Console patches?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eemtf_V67WU&t=741s) - Mikael mentions they released a Console patch last week *(might be related to* [*Patch 1.1.2.0*](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Patch_1.1.2.0)*)*, and released one on December 2, 2025 *(similar to* [*Patch 1.1.2.1*](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Patch_1.1.2.1)*)* (FICSMAS Patch), and **there will be another Console Patch on December 9, 2025** *(It is unclear if Consoles use same Patch Version Numbers as PC release).*

   * 🚩 More Game Patches are planned *if they have time*, since most of CSS will be gone from **December 15, 2025 through January 15, 2026.**

* [State of Dev - Console Patches & Crashes - Continued](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eemtf_V67WU&t=841s) - Mikael continues the discussion about Console crashes. He mentions that those experiencing crashes might see these fixed as a result of a ""higher priority issue"" being fixed.

   * It was mentioned that Console players who see crashes will often be able to reboot game and continue playing, losing only a small amount of gameplay based on how frequently you do auto-saves *(which should be left at default of 5 minutes)*.

   * 🛠 [**Fix / Workaround For Crossplay Client Join Issue**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eemtf_V67WU&t=910s) - For Console players doing Crossplay / Multiplayer which crash and Client can't rejoin, it is recommended the host **rollback** to an earlier **cloud save** and attempt restart crossplay / multiplayer game session.

      * **Xbox Series X/S** - View [Manage your cloud gaming saves and storage](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/cloud-gaming/manage-storage).

* [State of Dev - Recent Console patches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eemtf_V67WU&t=1332s) - Mikael talks about what has recently been fixed on Consoles. He reads a long list which can be listened to if interested. *These should be shown on next Patch Notes released.*


* [State of Dev - Bug Talks next stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eemtf_V67WU&t=1664s) - Next weeks livestream will include a Bug Talks portion where Mikael shows the progress in solving some of the bugs and issues seen in the game by showing in-game play content.


* [State of Dev - Pass It On 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eemtf_V67WU&t=1689s) - Mikael mentions [Pass It On (PIO) 10](https://passiton.events/events/satisfactory/pass-it-on-10) which is a fan-made contest where you can build something from any of the 9 themes from the previous 9 SF PIO events.

**Start Q&A Portion**

* 🚩 [Q&A: When is the last stream/video before Coffee Stain Studios goes on holiday?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NylDyER79yM) - ANSWER: The livestream on **Tuesday, December 9th, 2025** will be the *last livestream** for 2025. There will be no livestream on Tuesday, December 16th, 2025, but Mikael *might* do a ""chill out livestream** that week. **There will be a final video around Christmas*.

* [Q&A: Hints about 1.2?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXpuyV5MwRA) - ANSWER: Mikael states in the last 3 videos, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwmpNWuKIJ0), and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYB5dR7Pl_s) and even [this ""Ad"" one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eyZ3gYKtVk), all have ""clues"" about some things coming in Version 1.2.

* [Q&A: Is 1.2 going to come out this year?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnEWrGdEKM0) - ANSWER: **No**. Expect Version 1.2 sometime in first half of 2026.

* [Q&A: Keyboard & Mouse support for Console?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4UmMtjILV0) - ANSWER: They will try to get this in the Version 1.2 release *(subject to change).*

* [Q&A: Is further Character Customization still planned?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTKfqqlcaII) - ANSWER: Not for Version 1.2, but they ARE looking at this, so *maybe after Version 1.2.* 

* [Q&A: Rain?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSR-d419TTY) - ANSWER: They wanted this in Version 1.1, but could not make it happen, so it looks good that this will be in Version 1.2.

* [Q&A: New Maps?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TCZm_nIZFU&t=1418s) - ANSWER: This **won't be in Version 1.2**. It will take a lot of effort to make a new map *when or if it is done*, so don't plan on it anytime soon.

* [Q&A: Any consideration for making different versions of existing Buildings?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdRJsF9j1g8) - ANSWER: Depending on what happens to the game in the far future, this might be something they consider.

* [Q&A: More Seasonal Events?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYeu7K0yPU) - ANSWER: They ARE interested in doing this, but seasonal events take up valuable game development time, so they are only done *if there is time to do so*.

* [Q&A: Can you correct the record on who added the ""hehe"" status to the QA Site?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qT0tUC8VoA) - ANSWER: It was Coffee Stain Studios QA Manager - Julio Méndez ( u/JulioUzu ) who posted the [Hehe Status on some Q&A Posts](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/search?date=All%20Time&status=hehe).

* [Q&A: Satisfactory 2.0?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=une8N3PqIvo) - ANSWER: Mikael did state *""there is something brewing in the pot. a clear vision that is definitely bigger than a 1.x update""*. Take that to mean whatever you think.

beginner here, I am in need of some barista knowledge please:

In our café we have a beautiful La Marzocco Linea Classic S 2 Group AV and a Mahlkönig Grinder and Tamper. Everything is setup for the double shot and this setup is going well I'd say. But often we don't need two shots, so it seems like a terrible waste not using 50% of the coffee. 

  
So we then got the single filter, ground beans are coming correct out of the grinder, but as soon as we want to tamp we're struggeling, because it seems all the ground coffee needs to go exactly into that little recess? During a busy day at a café its a bit of a struggle and not at all as intuitive as the double shot. We then also need to tamp it with a seperate tamper, all good, but how do I know if I am using too much / little strength? Sometimes the espresso comes out right, sometimes not. In the end we just end up using the double. 

What are we doing wrong?

1phktpe,https://i.redd.it/pq8ltnmo116g1.jpeg,Is there a Tarot deck you don’t dive with and/or really dislike?,"I present to you the deck I absolutely dislike the most, the Rider-Waite Smith (AKA RWS). It doesn’t matter which version of this deck I own, I simply cannot connect with it. I can’t get any of my own or readings for others to make sense and nothing flows for me. 

Now one of my biggest pet peeves is when I hear the Gatekeepers tell newbies that they absolutely 100% **NEED** to learn how to read tarot using this deck and I’m here to straight up disagree with those people and to tell you newbies that they’re wrong. If you want to learn tarot, you can learn using almost any deck you choose. Now, will some decks be more challenging? Absolutely. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible. 

The one thing positive thing I can say about the RWS is that it was useful for me to learn the imagery associated with each card, except the court cards. For a group of cards that’s could either represent a person, qualities of a person, a message and many other things in the RWS deck, the cards are dull, hard to interpret and connect with. Excluding the court cards, learning the traditional imagery of the cards has been very helpful in helping me interpret cards from other decks. But ask me to take a RWS deck and do a reading with it? It’s not going to happen and if it does, it won’t be a good one. 

That being said, learning the traditional imagery isn’t what helped me learn how to read tarot cards. That’s a completely different story for a different post. 

Now I want to hear from you! 👇 Tell me about a deck you dislike and/or don’t jibe and why.

She won't stop doing it though, and the smell is unlike anything else. It takes up the whole room, and makes my sofa and couch cusions smell very bad afterwards. She does not drink water, and said she hasn't in about 6 years, because the taste is too boring. She drinks only coffee, which she puts 6 sugars into. She will drink soda ad well, but no water. She sleeps without bed sheets, and her bed smells bad, and she does her laundry, and dumps it onto the floor, where it just kind of mixes into the dirty stuff. It looks like a hoarders room. I cleaned it out completely with her twice, but it went rihjt back to looking like it did... Took me two weeks each time I cleaned it. She hates showering since she finds it too hard to do, and gets out of breath, and says her hair type is too difficult to shower with. She has no desire to change her diet or health, but is there anything I can do to lessen the smell? She is a wonderful and funny person, and frankly the only friend in my whole world. Thank you!

I do wear an apron and my pockets don’t necessarily get wet. But my hands are damp sometimes when I have to use the knife. What has your experience been with K390? Does it rust fast even if it’s just fresh water that I wipe off at the end of the day?

Hi friends! 

I am moving to LA with my husband in March, and we’d love recommendations on specific complexes or neighborhoods, as we start our search. 

We really value walkability. We live in Northern California right now and everything is a 15 minute drive, so we’d love to be walking distance to nice coffee shops, grocery stores, gyms, or any other third places. 

We are looking for a 2 bedrooms apartment, or a very spacious one bedroom. And our budget is $3500-3800 but willing to go higher for the right price. 

Since we’ve been living in the suburbs, I’d also love to hear your favorite activities, restaurants and events in the area, we are eager to explore! 

We are currently looking in these areas, but would love other suggestions and why you’d suggest the neighborhood.

Please give us suggestions for apartment complexes in one of these areas:

 - Beverly Grove
- WeHo 
- Woodland Hills
- Studio/Valley Village

So far I have loved Palazzo West in Beverly Grove and Sage LA in Central LA! 

Thank you in advance 💖

The listing claims you get 22 treatments, but the math is fuzzy: 20 regular strips plus 2 bonus strips, each treatment uses one upper and one lower strip, so you actually receive 22 pairs of strips, not 22 full treatments. That’s a subtle but important distinction, because if you use the strips as directed, you’ll run out in 11 days, not 22. The price per strip is therefore closer to 68 cents, which is still cheaper than a coffee, but the value proposition is less impressive than the listing makes it appear.

The marketing copy leans heavily on the idea that these strips are enamel-safe and dentist-recommended. The reality is that the strips contain the same hydrogen-peroxide-based gel as any other over-the-counter whitening product, and the safety profile is therefore identical. The claim that the strips are uniquely enamel-safe is therefore a bit of a stretch, though the strips do include a no-slip grip feature that makes them less messy than some competitors.

The listing also claims that the strips are a $400 value, which is a bit of a stretch. The kit is a $30 purchase, and the strips are not reusable, so the value proposition is based on the assumption that you would otherwise spend $400 on a professional whitening treatment. The reality is that most consumers will not pay $400 for a single treatment, and the strips are a more accessible option. The value proposition is therefore based on a false dichotomy.

The listing also claims that the strips are enamel-safe, but the reality is that any peroxide-based whitening product can cause sensitivity, and the strips are no exception. The marketing copy does not mention this, and the consumer is left to assume that the strips are uniquely gentle.

The listing also claims that the strips are a 3D White product, but the 3D White line is a different product line from the Professional Effects line. The marketing copy is therefore a bit of a misnomer, and the consumer may be confused about which product they are purchasing.

The listing also claims that the strips are a 20-minute treatment, but the reality is that the strips must be worn for 30 minutes, and the consumer may be confused about the time commitment required.

The listing also claims that the strips are a 20-treatment pack, but the reality is that the strips are packaged in 10 pouches of 2 strips each, and the consumer may be confused about how many treatments they are receiving.

The listing also claims that the strips are a bonus pack, but the reality is that the bonus pack is simply the same product in a different package, and the consumer may be confused about what they are receiving.

In summary, the Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects kit is a serviceable product that will likely deliver some whitening effect, but the marketing copy is a bit of a stretch, and the value proposition is based on a false dichotomy. The consumer is paying for the brand name, not the product efficacy.

Massive confusion. A real cluster f\*ck. - Today the wife and I spotted a car on their website that we wanted to buy. Called ahead for appointment. Provided them with the stock number of the car and confirmed that it was available. Made appointment and went to dealership. After arriving they made us wait for 40 minutes. Then when the sales person showed up he expected us to walk about a mile to see the car. What made it frustrating is that the sales guy barely understood English. While we were waiting we couldn't help but notice that the whole place was filled with Bomnin employees whose only form of communication was to shout at each other and hug and dance. I didn't mind - after all this is Miami, and folks get a little vocal and touchy feely. After dealing with that weirdness we gave the place a pass. If their business model is to have customers walk over several miles to view cars on the car lot, then they should market the place as a fitness or exercise destination in addition to buying a car. 

The wife and I have visited a bunch of dealers in south dade. We have been given rides in golf carts if the cars are a distance. Or they are driven up to us at the showroom. Walking miles and miles in the hot sun is something we can do at home. We don't need to go to a car dealership. We finally picked our car - a Buick Encore - at Williamson Cadillac, GMC. Nice place. Took the elevator to our car, grabbed a cup of coffee, did a test drive in the neighborhood, and they are doing a little touch up and painting at no extra charge. The sales staff are great.

I was the Keeper, and I’d really appreciate your thoughts on whether I’m overreacting, being too sensitive, or whether one of my players actually crossed a line.

I prepared the scenario myself – roughly 20 hours of work:

* custom handouts (some quite elaborate)
* NPC photos (printed and cut out)
* newspaper clippings
* custom tokens for NPCs, monsters, and PCs
* drawn maps
* and I provided coffee, tea, water, and snacks

There were six of us in total (me + 5 players).

The Start: The investigators receive a letter asking them to come to a small town (1920s, Alabama). The letter explicitly includes the sheriff’s name and is meant to be used as proof of legitimacy if needed.

The very first scene:

* an NPC (deputy) stops their car
* he mentions there have been animal attacks recently
* he has orders from the sheriff to turn away strangers for now
* he asks why they are here
* the scene also clearly describes about 10 armed men in the immediate area

So far, no pproblem. But one of the players (playing a **bookshop owner**) reacts like this:

***“That’s none of your business. Get lost!”***

The deputy repeats the question. Player:

***“Shut up, that’s none of your business.”***

The deputy stays polite and repeats the question once more. The player:

**draws his firearm.**

The deputy whistles, the armed men approach, and he says:

***“Last chance. Why are you here?”***  
***“Otherwise, accept the consequences.”***

The player’s answer?

***“I shoot the deputy.”***

A gunfight broke out. Two investigators were killed. Afterwards the mood at the table was basically ruined. The player who provoked all of this accused *me* of “overreacting” and claimed it was “bad style” to kill a player before the story really started.

Eventually we retconned it and decided his character was only gravely injured so we could move on. I also played it as if the incident had no further consequences in the town.

Honestly, I’m shocked. I put in a lot of work so everyone can have a good time, and the very first thing someone does is escalate without any reason.

Especially when playing a bookshop owner – who obviously wouldn’t react like that in-character. And the player should also realize that the entire scenario can’t even begin if you immediately start a firefight in the opening scene.

So, what do you think?

* Am I overreacting?
* Should I have handled it differently?
* Or is this just disrespectful murder-hobo behavior and someone testing boundaries?

I’d really appreciate your feedback because I’d like to reflect on this rather than just be upset.

Thanks

# TL;DR

Player insults and threatens a NPC, pulls gun, shoots him, provokes a gunfight in the very first scene, then dies and blames the Keeper for it. I’m wondering if I’m too sensitive or if that’s simply disrespectful behavior.",40,1765219455.0,callofcthulhu,51,0.94,False

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Ever feel like you're running on autopilot, just going through the motions? Or maybe you have big dreams but the daily grind feels… well, *grindy*? I've been there. It's easy to get stuck, right? But what if I told you that unlocking ""Your Life 2.0"" isn't some far-off fantasy? It's about weaving in smart habits, little by little, that compound into massive change.

Think about it. We're not talking about drastic overhauls that burn you out. It's the small, consistent actions that truly pave the way to living that dream life we all envision.

Here are a few habits that have been game-changers for me, and I’m curious to hear what works for you all:

*   **Morning Ritual Reboot:** Instead of hitting snooze a million times, what if you dedicated just 15 minutes to yourself? Maybe it's journaling, some light stretching, or simply enjoying a quiet cup of coffee before the chaos begins. It sets a positive tone that ripples through your entire day.

*   **The Power of ""One Thing"":** In a world of endless to-do lists, what if you focused on identifying and completing just *one* truly impactful task each day? That one thing that moves the needle towards your biggest goals. It’s surprisingly liberating and incredibly effective.

*   **Mindful Consumption:** We're constantly bombarded with information. Being intentional about what you consume – be it news, social media, or even conversations – can free up so much mental energy. Ask yourself: ""Is this adding value to my life?""

*   **Scheduled ""No""s:** This one is tough but essential. Learning to say no to things that don't align with your priorities, even if they seem good in isolation, creates space for the things that truly matter. It’s about protecting your energy and focus.

*   **Gratitude as Fuel:** It sounds simple, but actively practicing gratitude – even for the little things – can shift your entire perspective. It reminds you of what you have, making the pursuit of what you desire feel less like a struggle and more like an expansion.

Sometimes, navigating the ups and downs of personal growth can feel overwhelming. If you find yourself needing extra support to process emotions or develop coping strategies, I've found that **this resource (affiliate link)** has been incredibly valuable for many people on their journey. It offers tools and guidance that can really make a difference.

I used to work in an office environment with a lot of peers and it was awesome. I really liked going out to grab a coffee with a coworker and talking about random things, sometimes getting deeper, and forming friendships. There was something really special about having some good chats and support throughout the work day, even if I had other relationships/friendships in my life.

I've since moved jobs and while there are many improvements, I haven't found the same level of friendships, and the job can be quite isolating. It would be lovely to make a few, even virtually.

Friendships are really important in both good times and bad times, and I would be grateful for the opportunity to be able to support one another. Truth be told that this year has been quite difficult for me, but I think that is all the more reason to pursue more meaningful friendships.

The most important thing to me in the conversations would be honesty and consistency. It would be great to receive that, and I would be happy to do the same.

I have had SIBO symptoms in the past (lots of pain and burping). Navigate frequent vaginal itchiness and off discharge (what feels like BV but i test negative most of the time). I've also had spells of chronic diarrhea. My tongue is heavily coated in white. I am hopeful that addressing my gut microbiome will support healing the symptoms I have named. Here we go!

\-two tbs of chia seed in water with about 4 oz of no-sugar straight cranberry juice  
\-taking berberine twice daily (gonna try this four weeks with no plan for long-term) - i have been reading about the ability for berberine to do more than kill bad bacteria, so that's why I'd like to try this one  
\-i like messing around with herbs, so i might do Oregon grape root concoction for berberine  
\-taking vitamin c, coq10 with an omega, cranberry extract  
\-focusing on eating a very nutritious whole food diet (meat, fish, local pastured dairy, eggs, quinoa, brown rice, lots of varied veggie, beans, stewed apples, berries, some citrus, cooked and raw garlic, homemade ferments like kimchi and kraut, miso, homemade yogurt, plentiful water, salt) -trying for very little processed foods and sugar right now, try to focus less on restriction though and more on just feeding my lil bacteria guys as much fuel as possible  
\-i have been making ginger, lime, turmeric, pineapple shots and freezing to have daily (for immune, gut, and menstrual cycle)  
\-also drinking homemade jujube/red date tea daily (this is supposedly great for immune and gut health and menstrual cycle)  
\-PHGG

Due to scheduling issues and his work schedule he ended up getting diagnosed based ok a spinal tap, and never did an overnight sleep study. He did eventually do an at home thing to check for apnea which was negative. 


He’s been taking armodafinil for a while now and its helped him a lot. He’s still adjusting the dosage, and by afternoon/evening it seems to wear off. His doctor is now prescribing him a sodium oxybate for overnight, but I’m curious if it’s reasonable without a more detailed sleep study. He rarely has any problems going to sleep or sleeping through the night, and wakes up easily. He typically is up before me and is wide awake, bringing me coffee. The sleep attacks and cataplexy are rarely early morning. It makes me wonder about the quality of his sleep, and if it’s worth the nighttime meds. In fact, since starting meds he says he dreams less (very little now, if at all), which makes me think maybe his rem cycles have already improved.


He’s going to try and maybe he’ll see a big difference, but has anyone else gotten on sodium oxybates without a sleep study? Is it normal to just try it? Should he bother pressing his dr to do a sleep study or skip it and save himself the headache? I really only worry because I’ve read so much about side effects.",0,1765219120.0,Narcolepsy,4,0.5,False

January marks the beginning of winter, rather than its conclusion, and it requires strategic comfort preparation that will support long cold months ahead when outdoor activities diminish and indoor living dominates daily routines. Thoughtful environmental design prevents the seasonal depression that inadequate comfort and bleak surroundings can trigger during the darkest, coldest period of winter.

**Living Space Comfort Layering**

How do I prepare for extended indoor time? [Soft winter cushions for living room](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/velvet-cushions) seating turn areas into true havens that support the increased indoor hours winter weather dictates. Plush comfort invites the use of living spaces rather than retreating to bedrooms when the gathering areas are not cozy enough.

Layer cushions in varying textures and firmness levels that accommodate everything from upright reading to lounging during movie marathons that characterize winter entertainment when outdoor alternatives become limited or unpleasant.

**Seasonal Table Aesthetics**

What are some visual features that help fight off winter dreariness? [Winter-themed table runners](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/table-runner) in rich textures and warm colors create focal points to avoid the visual monotony associated with seasonal mood challenges. Deep jewel tones or warm neutrals bring sophistication without overwhelming the spaces with extended viewing across long winter months.

**Temperature Comfort Management**

How can I stay warm but not overheated? Quality cushioning insulates between the bodies and furniture, creating cozy nests that are perceived as warm without turning the thermostats up to uncomfortable levels, which dry the indoor air unnecessarily, not to mention the extra cost.

Strategic comfort layering can allow for lower ambient temperatures that maintain better air quality, while personal comfort zones through cushions and blankets offer the individual warmth preference without household-wide temperature compromises.

**Light and Color Psychology**

What colors support winter well-being? Warm tones in cushions and table textiles combat the cool gray light dominating most of the winter days. Amber, rust, deep burgundy, and golden colors create psychological warmth even when actual temperatures remain cold throughout the extended winter season.

Save cooler palettes for summer, when their refreshing qualities provide welcome relief rather than reinforce the seasonal cold and darkness. Cold blues and stark whites can amplify winter's natural bleakness.

**Creation of Zones of Activity**

Where should winter activities be focused? Design specific areas for reading, crafting, puzzles, or hobbies that winter provides time to pursue. Dedicated comfortable spaces encourage engagement rather than passive screen time, which tends to dominate when other alternatives lack adequate environmental support.

Multiple activity zones avoid single-room monotony that may arise during prolonged indoor periods since varied environments are conducive to mental health through the variety of space, even when outdoor variety is impossible.

**Social Gathering Preparation**

How do spaces support winter socializing? Comfortable seating capacity encourages the invitation of friends over, rather than isolation during months when outdoor meetups become impractical. The ability to socialize during winters helps to combat seasonal isolation threatening mental health during dark and cold months.

Sufficient cushioning and warm textiles make the hosting job doable, not a marathon preparation that deters impromptu winter gatherings; such gatherings could provide so much-needed social connection during isolating months.

**Self-Care Environment Design**

What spaces support winter wellness? Create cozy coffee sit out  nooks with comfortable cushioning that invite warming rituals, during the demanding winter season.

These comfort zones enable the self-care practices that are important at such times of the year when diminished sunlight, cold weather, and limited outdoor access challenge mental health, which especially needs proactive environmental support.

**Maintenance Planning**

How do I keep the winter spaces functional? Regular fluffing, rotating, and cleaning of pillows will keep them comfortable and compliment the long use while providing the required aesthetic.  Proper maintenance prevents gradual degradation that makes spaces appear neglected despite good initial preparation.

Prepare to outlast the duration of winter with soft winter cushions that offer comfort in the living room, while table runners provide the visual warmth that supports both physical comfort and mental well-being through the longest, darkest season that demands comprehensive environmental preparation for indoor living.",1,1765219025.0,u_TrafficMasterB,0,1.0,False

I've been constantly in my overdraft in the middle of months - despite moving back in with parents in the last year i'm finding some regret/guilt of overspending when I didn't have this sfaety place as I do right now. I think I've always could've been tighter and spent less - and this has improved dramatically on clothing. events etc. But my income of roughly £35,000 hasn't changed at all year on year and the business pulls in roughly £50-£55k steadily (coming back from a dip post 2023).  
  
So more info:

Savings:

* £4,000 in LISA.
* £7,200 in Cash ISA.
* £8,000 Pension.

Debts:

* £3,800 PayPal Credit balance (paid of currently at £108 month).
* I have since wiped off any Klarna and Pay in 3s as of last month too which amounted to £600.

Monthly Needs \[£1,342.98\]

* £365 Car (43 months left on PHP).
* £200 (£50x4) Food shop.
* £143 Council Tax.
* £108 Paypal Credit balance DD.
* £125 Car charging.
* £59 Gym (I used this for classes as I go everyday).
* £50 Therapy session.
* £46 Car insurance.
* £25 Mobile contract (24 months).
* £22 Medication.
* £21.99 Apps.
* £20 haircut.
* £18 Contact lenses.
* £11.99 Spotify.
* £7 Bank account charge.

Monthly Wants \[£368.00\]

* £100 Eating out.
* £80 Food shop extras (unplanned groceries/household item replacing).
* £78 Coffee/Breakfasts.
* £45 Snacks/corner shop.
* £35 Nails.
* £19 Cinema sub.
* £11 Charity.

It's clear to me it's the regular smaller infrequent purchases like popcorn at cinema, coffee, sundry/casual small spending that I feel blind too as from these i should be cutting it pretty clear - especially without rent too atm - which was a factor before in July of £650 + Bills.

When I look at my banking apps and YNAB - the last few months have been between £2,300 - £2,900 - again due to paying off more Klarna/Paypal payments.

If anyone has any tips or things that have worked for them to be strict and tighten on the extra spending that's worked for them!

I’ve had two shitty exes na hindi deserve ang effort ko eh charot HAHAH but I now have a manliligaw who treats me really, really well. Sobrang manhater ako kasi both of my exes cheated and abused me lol kaya grabe talaga trust issues ko with my manliligaw. Pero while I was reflecting on our relationship, bigla akong napasulat ng letter hahaha

For context, busy pareho ang schedules namin. I’m a law student while he’s a doctor. Pero kahit after ng 15-hour duty niya sa hospital and his 2.5hr drive from work to my condo, talagang he will help me pa with cleaning my room and handling my errands for me 🥹 I’m super spoiled din sa lahat! He plans our dates well lagi, gives me just because flowers on top of the usual flowers he gives me during our dates, drive me to and from school whenever he can, writes me letters and poems, buys my coffee everyday (kahit food and other wants), assures me whenever i overthink (to the point na ako na mapapagod haha), has a note that contains all my likes and dislikes, loves me loudly (maximum flex sa ig and kahit sa family niya), and many many more! 

I’m still skeptical sa kanya but I’m learning to trust his words and actions ;-; sana di ako magkamali lol anyway, I’m super proud of my letter so I decided to share it here anonymously

Though hopeless bards and poets have long attempted to immortalize it in their verses, nothing truly captures the experience itself—the strange yet almost ordinary miracle of being loved by a man who yearns, nearly begs, for the chance to pour his devotion into the woman he reveres and worships.

I was wrapped in the quiet stillness of my world when you suddenly came into my life. Like the certainty of the rising and setting sun, you are a man full of overwhelming resolve—your eyes aglow with unwavering faith in a future that has yet to come. A future where you make me the happiest of all. Nonetheless, desire alone cannot carve destiny; we are, after all, merely human. Your vision of an unwritten future pales in comparison to my profound hatred and distrust. For there is nothing more fearful, more doubtful, and more fragile than a heart that was burned—not only once, but twice. And regrettably for you, that was the kind of woman I had become. 

Despite carrying this child-like hope of finding the prince that leads the princess to her happily ever after, I remained painfully aware of the wretched abundance of men who despoil and ravage women—whether by intention or careless ignorance. And so I met your gestures with piercing suspicion, threading malice into your actions and lacing your affection with imagined deceit. I was convinced you sought to captivate me only to capture me—like a hunter patiently waiting for his prey to lower its guard before pulling the trigger.

But you… you were a strange phenomenon. In your eyes, I was a prize. No, not like the glory that comes with the antlers of a newly caught deer. But the kind of treasure that feeds a starving soul. I was the first rain after a drought, the first bloom after winters of emptiness, the first yield after seasons of barren fields. Like that day after our visit to St. Jude, when we opened our birria from El Poco in the car—our bodies spent, our stomachs empty. And yet the first bite felt like an exhilarating revelation, like the world finally bending to your craving. That was how you held me in your gaze—not as a trophy to be paraded, but as the fulfillment of a yearning older than reason.  

It is difficult, if not impossible, to resist falling in love with a man who loves so deeply, so intentionally, and so unconditionally. I cannot claim to have completely fallen for you—but it is certain that I have taken a step further in that regard. I acknowledge your efforts. I understand your devotion. I recognize the sincerity of your admiration. Bear with me, for I am still riddled with fright and unease. Yet rest assured, I am trying—willingly, earnestly—to love you despite the tremors within me. 

You love with such abundance that I genuinely overflow—so much so that the peace you have given me radiates through every corner of my life. You make loving me feel effortless, when I once believed I was the hardest person in the world to love. Yet, time and again, you have gently challenged the prejudice I held against myself. I have lost count of the times you soothed me when my façade of strength cracked, the times you wiped away tears that refused to fall, and the times you drew out a smile so genuine it bared my teeth—something I rarely, if ever, allow myself to show.

You are navy blue in every depth and hue—like my old hair tie you always wear around your wrist, or like the gradient color of the sky melting into night. I was the moon caught in your embrace, my light drawn out only by your gravity. You carved a place for me at the center of your universe, honoring me fully, even as your life and mine followed different orbits. You yearned for me in every sense of the word. And what great joy it is to encounter a man so extraordinary that I find myself enamored with the slow, unfolding process of falling in love—with you, and with life itself.",1,1765218800.0,AlasFeels,1,1.0,False

How do I even interpret this?,"I (26M) need help. A week ago I met a girl (let's call her Sarah) who is 21 and with whom we talked a lot both in person and via messages, including on topics that are very close to us both. I really liked her and even asked her out for a drink and she agreed but said she can't do it now because she is busy with her studies. Last week, the day after chatting online for several days, she was visibly happy to see me and was smiling and embarrassed at the same time (covered her smile with her hand and leaned forward while turning away from me for a second).

Today, we talked once again and another student (24M) whom I also know was sitting next to us. During our conversation, Sarah put her hand on his shoulder numerous times, apparently to make sure she didn't offend him with her words (although I'm not sure about the real reason), but at one time he put his hand on hers (the one on the shoulder). Besides that, one time she said he has a 'good sense of humor' which for me is a clear sign that a girl is into a guy. She also called him by name numerous times but didn't call me by name once this time, even though me and her spent talking much more than him and her. Lastly, when we all needed to go to class, she briefly mentioned something about 'having coffee' which could mean they already had plans to go out despite her saying she is busy with her studies. What does it all mean? Is she into him? This situation caused me a lot of shock and severe distress today, and I don't know how to interpret it. I'm also asking this because I've never even dated anyone in my life yet (at least irl) so I don't know what all these signs mean. Please, help!",0,1765218773.0,relationship_advice,5,0.29,False

1phk58z,https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/s1eq56czbx,Inside the Zingboim family empire: How Israel’s 'Kardashians' built cosmetics powerhouse,"**In their first joint interview, cosmetics mogul Hava Zingboim and her daughters — often dubbed Israel’s Kardashians — discuss balancing business, faith and family, setting boundaries and why science outweighs flashy advertising**

Itay Yaakov | published:12.06.25 | 07:30

In a first profile published about her in 2009 in Yediot Ahronot’s “Where’s the Kid?” column, cosmetician Hava Zingboim described her daily routine: she woke up every morning at 5:15 to make sandwiches for her six children, headed to the gym, dropped them off and, by six, “was back home with the kids for homework, tests and school assignments.”

Since then, she sleeps even less. “Today I wake up at three in the morning,” she says. “Between three and five, I read, study and write. People get emails from me at insane hours.”

“Emails at four a.m.,” confirms her daughter, Emuna Ganz. “Those are usually the most important and serious ones.”

Fifteen years have passed since that article. Today, she runs the skin-tech corporation “Hava Zingboim,” which blends science and aesthetics. On Sunday, the brand unveiled its new Prophecy series before hundreds of cosmeticians who work with her, aiming to replicate the success of previous products in the line.

While celebrities like Bar Refaeli promote injecting salmon sperm into the face, Zingboim is less drawn to fleeting trends. She developed the new product, made of cross-linked hyaluronic acid, after encountering a study about three years ago.

“In MRI images of the skin, they saw that injected hyaluronic acid stays in the tissue under the skin for years,” she explains. “It was a stunning discovery. It’s a major shift, because unlike silicone, until now we treated hyaluronic acid as a substance the skin absorbs.”

Cross-linked hyaluronic acid undergoes a chemical bonding process that makes it thicker and more durable. According to Zingboim, Prof. Rachel Lubart and Dr. Lipovsky from the company’s R&D department managed to shrink the acid’s molecule without breaking its cross-linked structure.

“Once the acid stays deep in the skin for a long time, it triggers processes we now call biosimulation — renewing tissue at the skin’s depth,” Zingboim says. “In the injected areas and in areas where the hyaluronic acid remained, they detected increased production of collagen and anti-inflammatory compounds.”

After a series of tests, the company developed three products that she says deliver significant improvements to the skin’s appearance and “age” within two weeks: a gel cream, a serum and a rich cream. “We were shocked by the results. Within two weeks, there’s a drop in chronological age — wrinkle depth, fine lines, texture,” Zingboim says. “This isn’t just another cream. This is serious work by our R&D department.”

**What does that mean for the consumer?**

“Now she can apply cross-linked hyaluronic acid to the skin and stimulate collagen production. Today, to encourage collagen, we do invasive treatments like microneedling. Creating collagen naturally in the skin is completely new. It’s another step in what we used to call anti-aging and now call longevity.”

**A term that has become a major trend.**

“Longevity represents a major conceptual shift in our field. In anti-aging treatments, a patient comes to a doctor or cosmetician, and they’ll do everything to make the skin look better. Longevity is a completely different mindset. We want to ensure the skin reaches old age in peak health and help it perform its natural processes better. It’s a different perspective, not a trend.”

**It certainly feels like a trend being pushed from all directions. How did it suddenly catch on?**

“Because of new studies about aging, as well as research on nutrition and sports. These are constantly studied fields, huge industries, and the research drives a shift in how we think about lifespan and quality of life — not just appearance.”

**Can you promise that in two weeks I’ll look younger?**

“I don’t like promising things, and I’m very careful with that, but studies show rejuvenation in skin age. The skin looks younger, pigmentation improves, hydration levels rise and it’s more radiant.”

**We live in an age flooded with information — and misinformation — especially online. Who should I trust?**

“I’m in the same place. I also ask myself, ‘Should I let this information influence what I do?’ So I check who’s giving me the information. Like in any field, there are credible sources and serious researchers who’ve worked for many years. Then I check if others at that level say the same.”

**So we won’t be injecting salmon sperm into our faces.**

“No, that won’t happen. Why? Because if we’re talking about DNA fragments, you’re talking to me about fish DNA? I’m not a fish. There are things I ruled out from the start, like collagen supplements. For years, it didn’t make sense to me, and I didn’t take them. But twenty years passed, and studies came out showing that in certain conditions, with certain diets, it works. For now, I say: eat fresh salmon because it has proteins that enrich your diet — more than rubbing it on your face or injecting it.”

**Speaking of trends, we’re in an era where many influencers and celebrities launch skincare brands. You may be well-known, but they’re stronger than you on social media.**

“It’s like a chef preparing food for takeaway. He knows the chemistry, how food keeps over time, how to preserve its qualities. Then someone else with no knowledge arrives and cooks too. I respect anyone who opens a business, especially women — but you can’t compare that to someone who’s spent 30 years in the field and researches it. Unlike them, I work with skin, I treat people, I teach cosmeticians, I see their results. It’s work that is — I won’t say on a different level, okay? — but it’s different.”

Zingboim stresses that the new product is not meant to replace injectables, but to offer another option — one that can complement injections or serve as an alternative for those who don’t want a swollen look. She herself reduced fillers at age 50 because she didn’t like the appearance, and stopped entirely over the past year and a half.

“I see the growing demand for products that deliver quick results,” she adds. “People want instant, now, immediately. They don’t have time. And the age keeps dropping, so we’re seeing more and more products tailored for younger ages. Very young.”

**Fourteen to sixteen?**

“Younger. Ten, eight. They’re already talking about four-year-olds. There’s a company in the United States (Rini, co-owned by actress Shay Mitchell) that just launched face masks for four- and five-year-old girls. Today, girls aged ten and eleven are cosmetics consumers.”
'Being part of the family business obligates you'

The interview with Zingboim takes place at the company’s Ramat Gan offices, where her school sits alongside the training, research and development divisions. It is an empire. In each arm of the business, Zingboim has placed one of her four daughters. All identify somewhere along the religious spectrum — some with uncovered hair, some with wigs — and all live within a short radius around her in Ra’anana. Zingboim also has two sons (“the youngest is just now leaving home,” she says with a hint of sadness) and 13 grandchildren, including one-month-old Libi, who joins the interview as well.

The maternal umbilical cord has never really been cut, and for the first time, the women sit together for a joint interview about business, family, faith and the label often attached to them: “the Israeli Kardashians.” As with Kris Jenner, Zingboim’s daughters see their mother as a “momager.” “Sometimes I watch the Kardashians, hear Kris talk and say to myself: that’s Mom!” says Hodiya Matatia, 29, the company’s brand manager and head of social media.

“I don’t know if you watch,” adds Sapir Solomovitz, 36, a mother of four, formerly the VP of marketing and now in business development. “No matter how strong Kris is, she cries in a second. I love how composed and polished she is, and in a split moment, you say something emotional, and she just breaks down.”

Zingboim’s eldest daughter, Bat-El Gross, 38, a mother of six, was the first to join the business. She had planned to be an English teacher at a Bnei Akiva yeshiva in Ra’anana until she was called in. Later came the youngest daughter, Emuna Ganz, 25, a mother of one and now VP of R&D. Their father, Moti, is also involved. It is a family business where the work never really ends — even when they go home and close the door on the day.

“Being part of the family business obligates you. You’re not an employee in an office,” says Solomovitz. “We live and breathe it. We exchange messages, references, ideas. There are advantages — when I talk to my mom, I can also bring something up about my daughters and grab a quick coffee. We’re together at my parents’ house every Shabbat, and the next day we’re back at work. My husband always says, ‘Don’t you get tired of it?’ No, I don’t. You learn to balance personal, family and professional. So what if yesterday I yelled at her and hung up on her? You learn to set boundaries.”

**What’s the boundary?**

Matatia: “Shabbat. For my father, it’s very important that on Shabbat we don’t talk about work, don’t think about work. It’s sacred time.”

**Was it obvious to all of you that you’d join the business? Was this path set in advance?**

Matatia: “I never imagined I’d work here. After national service, everyone assumed I’d join the family business, but for me it wasn’t an option. I wanted to work in marketing, just not necessarily here — but one thing led to another. It’s a huge privilege to learn from our parents and work together as a family. We have a lot of disagreements, and we have to rise above them and say — what a privilege it is that we even get to argue about work. It’s not a fight; it’s a different way of looking at things.”

**Do you think Hava would have allowed you to choose another path?**

Matatia: “Look, each of us is doing another degree, each of us studies, each has another niche in life. I teach bridal classes and work as a mikveh attendant, and I’m doing a master’s in Bible studies.”

Solomovitz: “I resigned once and went to work at a startup because I felt I needed experience in other fields — and then I came back. Now I’m studying law. As a workplace, it lets us grow.”

Ganz: “I thought I’d be a special-education preschool teacher or study psychology, something in the therapeutic world. At the same time, I had a huge passion for this industry — helping people become the best version of themselves and feel confident in their appearance. What we do here can sound superficial, but it isn’t. It’s deep.”

**Hava, you also employ people who aren’t family. Do your daughters’ opinions carry extra weight?**

Zingboim: “Being my daughter gives no special privileges; on the contrary, my daughters work harder than anyone. I trust them deeply, just as I trust my teams. In work meetings, I know how to make decisions, and I know how to accept them — just as I do with the CEO, the deputy CEO or a department head. The bonus, for me, is that I love being around them and I love the women they’ve become. I couldn’t work the long hours I do if they weren’t around me.”

**Who do you ask for a raise — Mom or Dad?**

All together: “The CEO.”

Matatia: “According to the contract, he can even fire us. Working with your parents is the hardest thing. You need them to value you not because you’re ‘their daughter’ but because you truly do your job well.”

**In the office, do you call her Mom or Hava?**

Gross: “I think I’m the only one who calls her Mom. Even in emails, I write ‘Mom.’”

Ganz: “Let’s put it on the table — I used to call them Mom and Dad. Then I was told it was weird. So I said, ‘My mom.’”

Zingboim: “What is this ‘I’ll ask Dad’? Say ‘my dad,’ because ‘Dad’ became slang here. ‘Daddy, come to Daddy,’” she laughs. “Bottom line: whatever you call me, I’ll answer.”

Ganz: “I know calling her Mom isn’t formal enough, but when I talk to her, I say Mom, okay? And when I talk about you,” she turns to her mother, “I say Hava.”

Matatia: “I also used to say Mom, and switched to Hava — mother of all living.”

**You’re all on the religious spectrum, correct?**

Solomovitz: “On the spectrum, period.”

**How does faith shape the way you build and run the business?**

Solomovitz: “I’m a person with very strong faith in the Creator, and I believe everything has a reason. Our lifestyle is religious, although personally, I’ll admit that modest dress and head coverings never limited me. From a very young age, I was also in secular settings, so I stepped out of the religious bubble. That probably shaped me in some way.

“How does it affect decision-making? Many times I could have taken things hard, or when something didn’t work out the way I wanted, he always helped me understand and believe that everything is for the good. I don’t know if that comes from a religious or a spiritual place, but I interpret it as faith — that there’s something bigger guiding the path. Even if it’s not what I imagined or not at the pace I expected, there’s a reason.”

**Beauty and fashion brands sell to us through sex. If you were shooting a campaign for the new product, would you veto seductive poses?**

Gross: “Personally, I don’t connect to that, but it’s not my decision. Beyond that, the language or at least the DNA of our brand is about strength, not seduction or sexuality.”

Solomovitz: “When you have science and results on the ground, there’s less need to overshadow everything with something very sexual. I don’t need to push sex to get you to buy. On the contrary, it bothers me. I have the real thing.”

**Hava, in interviews over the years, you’ve spoken at length about your life story. You lived on the street as a teenager and later recovered from cancer. How did that shape your motherhood, and how did it shape theirs?**

Zingboim: “There’s no doubt my childhood shaped my motherhood and who I am. I grew up without a mother, and that absence is very present in my life. When she died, I was already an adult, but from a very young age, she didn’t function as a mother. She was very ill and not part of my life. From that place, I wanted to become a mother young. When I wake up every morning, I feel like a mother first, and I act from that place.”

Solomovitz: “It’s not just toward us. She calls her cosmeticians ‘my girls.’ Before I joined the business, I thought, ‘Sorry, I’m your daughter, who are these other girls?’ But her maternal warmth, which comes from her own lack, defines her personality.”

Zingboim: “When you lack something in childhood, you can let the absence define you and become that distant, detached mother who doesn’t get close, doesn’t touch, doesn’t hug; or you can take that emptiness and fill it with goodness. I decided to be the mother I wish I had. My motherhood fills a very big void — a void I know today can never fully be filled. No parenting will replace not having had a mother. Today I enjoy my children, their presence in my life, and their children. There is no greater joy than being an involved grandmother who spends time with her grandchildren.”

**An hour ago, you said you leave the office at 11 p.m. When do you find time?**

“Weekends are dedicated entirely to my grandchildren, and sometimes I see them during the week too. Some come in the mornings because their rabbit is in my yard. I know what each child likes, what interests them now. At the moment, the house looks like a playground that I update according to the grandkids’ hobbies. Right now we’re in a knights-and-dragons phase; before that it was cars.”

**You were young when she first became a public figure 17 years ago. Was it embarrassing that your mother became famous at 40?**

Gross: “My friends just wanted three seconds with her — for her to look at their skin and give an opinion.”

Solomovitz: “We can’t walk with her in the mall without people approaching her for a photo.”

Zingboim: “Even if we’re in the middle of an intense personal conversation, people don’t care. ‘Excuse me, are you Hava?’”

Solomovitz: “‘Excuse me, can you diagnose my skin?’”

Gross: “Personal space isn’t really a sacred concept in Israel.”

Solomovitz: “I think women connect to her because she proves there are no glass ceilings. Is something above us? Nothing. Someone invented this idea. You want to be a stay-at-home mom for a year? Go for it and be a stay-at-home mom.”

**That’s a big privilege, staying home for a year.**

Solomovitz: “It was an enormous privilege, something I reached with my fourth child, nearing 40. What I’m trying to say is that physically — there is no glass ceiling, and that’s something we were born into. You say she’s a larger-than-life woman, and she is. I’m aware of what happens in the male business world and of equality issues. I’m not saying it doesn’t exist — I’m saying that personally, I haven’t experienced it. I was born to a woman who managed to do everything with her own two hands.”
