About Me:
*   Mix, Asian, 6', fit (not a frequent gym-goer, but average fit built).
*   Good-looking, cute :) Good fashion sense, clean-cut overall.
*   DDF, excellent hygiene.
*   Based in Toronto. Can host under specific conditions. Would be better if you could host.
* I have done a Masters in Engineering. Doing a full-time job in an engineering firm.
*   Respectful, laid-back, and open-minded. Your comfort always comes first.


What I'm Looking For:

I've always been drawn to curvy women but it's not a must :) I am also fine with a slim build. I love the dynamic of youth meeting wisdom and am attracted to Asians though race isn't a dealbreaker if there's chemistry. Initially seeking a one-night stand, but I'd love for it to evolve into FWB if we connect. I am good with flirting, enjoying the idea of an older woman in charge. But once things heat up, I'm confident, dominant, and bring the energy of youth to impress.

The Plan:

Let's start with a chat to see if we vibe. Then, we can meet in public (coffee or a drink on me). I love the buildup and the anticipation of getting to know someone makes the experience much more exciting. I'm not looking to use or be used; I want a connection.

* Safety First:
I prioritize safety, so I'll need to verify you're real with a picture and some basic questions. Meeting in public first is non-negotiable, and I'm open to a quick call for verification too. Looking forward to a good chat, a good drink, and hopefully a memorable night with someone who shares this fantasy.

1i7qz7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/otomegames/comments/1i7qz7v/i_have_mixed_feelings_about_liliana_adornato/,I have mixed feelings about Liliana Adornato (Piofiore),"Ah, Liliana Adornato....our beloved leading lady/MC of Piofiore.....I see lots of people hype her up, saying how beautiful and amazing she is as a heroine. Others saying how she was a stupid MC. And others treating her as a generic otome protagonist

My thoughts?

I'll start with her in general and move onto how she is in the other routes. I know lots of players talk about how the 'eyeless MC' of games are creepy and have no personality so it's left to the player's choice. Not only is Lili's design extremely beautiful, but she definitely speaks more for herself than most otome MC's. Compared to someone like the heroine in Amnesia who 1) doesn't have a canon name 2) doesn't have a canon personality cause, well.... memory loss, or voltage inc MC's that don't even have eyes, Liliana is certainly an upgrade! She's gorgeous and has a personality! She's kind-hearted, caring, motherly, good at cooking + cleaning, waifu material! Sure, she may seem like a generic goody-goody otome protag, but due to the fact she was a church girl in 1920's Italy, I'd say it suits her better than something like her being a cold-hearted assassin that ends up joining the mafia  in the end

Lots of ppl's main complaints abt Otome protags, aside from a lack of personality is the default 'damsel in distress' trait. Once again, considering Lili's upbringing and where/when the story is set, this didn't really bother me as much as it does with other protags such as say Ichika from CxM (girl, you're a cop ffs!). What makes Lili really stand out imo is that her personality + even her canon appearance is constantly commented upon by other players (her golden hair, her kindness, how good she is at baking, etc.). She tends to 'blend in' more with the characters in the story rather than stand out bc of 'self insert' syndrome. Even when her personality lowkey shifts depending on the route/guy (I adored her MUCH more in Yang's route than say Dante's or Nicola's), she still maintains these canon traits that make her stand out as her own character. She plays the 'damsel in distress', but it makes sense. She's naive, but it makes sense. She has the default 'good at cooking + cleaning waifu traits', but again, it makes sense! I know I keep using a character's backstory as a basis for why I can tolerate something, but once again....IT MAKES SENSE! Otome games don't have to be realistic for me to like them, but if you have an MC's who's writing makes rational sense, I won't end up hating them

Now you're probably wondering why this is titled my having mixed feelings about Lili when all I did was sing praises about her so far. Allow me to introduce the things that I happen to have issues with

1) The game doesn't really allow for 'self inserting'

\-You're probably raising your brow at this, cause this was one of the points I said that made me like Lili. But otome games either have two extremes of this. 1) Give the MC no canon appearance/personality so the player can self insert, but ends up making an unlikeable blank slate character in the process or 2)Give the MC a canon appearance/personality/and even backstory, but ends up leaving no room to self insert. The LI's canonically speak/say Lili's name if her canon name is chosen (there is literally voiced lines of them saying ""Lili""). Her having canonical blond hair in cg's was something I can tolerate, there's lots of MC's that have brown hair, and I have black hair irl. But the fact the other characters are flat out saying she had blond hair makes me feel like the player's ability to self insert through Lili is narrowed. Her being an orphan of the church is a good enough background to start with. The >!key maiden plot!<, I honestly just didn't care for it overall. Ik it serves more of a purpose depending on which route you choose, but still felt like a.....>!strange way to make the MC's special!<. The only thing that's stopping me from removing that part completely from my own piofiore mc is that Dante is my bias and I'm a sucker for the >!'destined to be'!< trope

2) The whole church upbringing/plot point

\-Being a muslim myself, I found the religious theme of piofiore to be rather....annoying? I didn't mind it, I was never really attached to Islam heavily, and some of the routes don't even have any relevance to the >!key maiden plot.!< But the routes that do, it just kinda drags. Especially when christianity in this game is treated more of a 'supernatural, greek mythology' sorta plot device. >!Like seriously...the key maiden + a Falzone has to bang in order to open the tomb of Jesus Christ?!< That's what makes the MC so special? Again, she doesn't need to be a badass assassin with a tragic past to feel more lively, but I felt as if the game could've done more with making Lili special. Some say she's 'ordinary' but I feel the people that say this just don't think about the her as the >!key maiden !<cause the subplot itself is just kinda weird 

3) Her role in different routes

\-This is more of an issue with the game itself rather than Lili, but it also affects how I saw her. Again, it's 1920's Italy, a time where Mussolini came into power and women were expected to have their duties revolve around domestic life. But c'mon!!! In Yang's, Orlok's and even Gil's route, Lili actually did something! >!She got to witness the darkness of the mafia in Yang's route, was on the run in Orlok's route, went on dates in Gil's route!<, etc. For a women during her time, Lili was pretty involved in these routes more than the Falzone's, where she was just baking and making Dante/Nicola coffee! Ik she has some develop in the sequels, even when she is with a Falzone (>!in Dante's 1926, she was learning english to becoming an asset to the family!<). But if she could use her brain in those routes, I dunno why she was done dirty in the Falzone family's routes. There can be more to an MC than just 'waifu traits', even if you're realistically limited due to the time period. Again, Otome games don't have to be realistic, just make enough sense! 

It's been a while since I touched Piofiore, so I may have forgotten some things, but I just wanted to share my thoughts about our precious Liliana! I think about her a lot more than other otome MC's, for better or for worse. It's hard finding the right balance between self insert and MC's with a personality/spine. I feel as if Lili tipped a bit much in the latter part, I didn't feel as if I could really project onto her as the player",2,1737593067.0,otomegames,0,1.0,False

They are sometimes physically abusive but most of the time its emotionally abusive. Its been going on since I was 8 yrs old and I cant take it anymore. Ive tried to commit so many times and what happened recently just really triggered me but i basically dress and do my makeup alternatively, i have a lot of piercings on my face and ears too and my parents have never liked any of it and i slowly got them to not mention it but i wore goth makeup on monday and i came home and was cooking food for myself and i heard my mom come home so i immediately wiped off my black lipstick but my face was still white and as soon as my mom saw that my cheeks were the color white, the FIRST thing she says to me is why do You look like that. Immediately i felt so horrible and i was thinking to myself “not this again” because its not the first time she has disliked me doing my makeup but this time it was different. She kept on saying if im trying to look like a clown and that i look bad and look like i belong in a circus. Right?.. who says this to their own daughter. I just ignored it and she didnt stop so i said “can you stop already” and she said “ohh now i cant even state an opinion anymore” like no dude the first thing u say to me when u come home is say that i look bad and that i look like a clown. I hate her narcissistic self so much and ive tried to forgive everyone in my family for the 9 years of physically and emotionally abusing me but im sick and tired. Theyre never gonna change. I just want a family that will love me for who i am, not one that constantly hates and judges me. And then my brother tries to be all controlling and comes into the kitchen and says “if you dont stop doing your makeup like that, im gonna ground you” and i said “how is my makeup affecting how you” and he just mocked me because HES in the wrong and then the day after i had an important test so before i left for school he was like “where are you going” and i said “school, i already told mom i have a test” and he then came in front of me and said “why did you cover your face with the scarf” and i said “because its cold outside” I felt really anxious because I knew something like this would happen or ruin my morning, he then tried pulling off my scarf and I was like stop and I gently pushed his hand and he yelled “FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU” and forcefully pulled off my scarf off my face and neck and spilled his coffee everywhere and said “acting like i wont let you go out” like yes dude that literally what u did. And he pushed my scarf in my hand and then pushed me out the door and i had a horrible panic attack and called 988 because i felt so horrible and had to talk to someone because i was hyperventilating super badly and the person who answered eventually made a good point that he mightve triggered me from when i was 12 when he hit me a lot and it took him 3 days to apologize and it was a half assed apology too. He kept on blaming me and apologized for pushing me and everything and i just responded that i didnt care for his excuse because his aggression was unnecessary and that he ruined my day and that i dont feel safe around him anymore and he responded to that by blaming me again so i just left him on read and yes unfortunately i have to live in the same house as him and see his face. I feel so suffocated like i cant express the stuff that i want to dress like or be and i hate it so much. Its the times that i feel the most confident too that they have to make me feel horrible. Im not sure if i want to call cps because what if they just tell my parents to get therapy and they leave me here?? I dont want that. Ill be so scared for my safety after that, they will truly dislike me for calling cps on them. Im safe right now but its because im choosing not to talk to them.

~ told her other daughter she was the product of rape despite being in a relationship at the time (guy she left on her wedding night and ad far as I know he never did anything bad to her) and denied her father being involved with her (later dna testing proved that he was her dad) 
~ lied to all her kids (4surviving) about who their dads were and prevented them from having relationships with their biological fathers (ie she would tell them people that weren’t their fathers were and make them call the wrong person dad) 
~ would stop taking her meds every few months, forgetting who she was and disappearing for days/weeks leaving her kids to fend for themselves or becoming violent with them
~ killed several pets of her kids in various horrific ways in front of them. 
~ was with a very violent man, then cheated on him with his brother, he snapped and went to his mother telling her that he was going to murder them all. This resulted in the police smashing down her door, grabbing them all and   Everyone having to change their names and move away. (Caused huge issues for my partner trying to get ID and a license as an adult and took months to sort out properly because it was never filed correctly with births deaths and marriages)

~ refused to help partner (write a statutory declaration) about name changes until he went off at her and told her that she was ruining his life and get her bum down to the courthouse. 

~ moved her kids from state to state to state every few weeks or months because cps would start to get suspicious about her. This resulted in all kids being extremely behind in school and pretty much all were illiterate until adulthood and dropped out of school before high school. 

~left her 15 year old daughter in a relationship with a 26yo man and moved states. 

~ started taking speed and would kick my then 13 yo partner out of her house to fend for himself for months at a time. 

~ dated a 19yo and got him hooked on stuff, later when she was off medication, freaked out because she didn’t know who he was, cracked him over the head with a bat, and knocked him out, telling her 13yo son to go dig a hole while she dismembered him. He refused and the guy woke up as they were arguing and walked out of the house. 

~ OD many times in front of her kids, would make a big scene over it saying she was going to kill herself, they would call the ambulance etc. The last time she did it my partner was 14 and told her to go ahead and he was sick of her threatening it all the time and went out without calling the ambulance. She called it herself, but still holds a grudge to this day that he didn’t call. 

~moved states again, met a 20yo (she was mid 40s at the time) got him hooked on morphine, made him quit his job and become her caregiver, isolated him from his family etc

~ would watch her grandson and let him play with his pill bottles (why on earth her daughter left her alone with her son is beyond my comprehension) 

~ let her partner od. Her daughter had a gut feeling that something wasn’t right when mil said that he was asleep and wouldn’t wake up, arrived at her house to find him blue and barely breathing, (her just casually lying next to him) when she asked what he had taken mil lied and said panadol. They later got out of her it was heroin, he was in the hospital for weeks and had lasting brain injuries, for months my partner called him 10 second S (like 10second tom off of 50 first dates)

~ begged my partner and I for money when she was coming down. Even trying to get our rent money. We were 18. Would get mad when we refused 

~ wouldn’t buy food for her youngest son, so we would take him in on and off for years, while she claimed benefits for him. 

~ would lie to her Dr about visiting us far away (we lived 45minutes away at the time) to get extra prescription meds. Have him call us, when her son refused, I answered the phone and said that she was lying to get extra meds. The dr told her that no one picked up and she got angry at my partner. 

~ we found a piece of paper with her writing my name as a signature (she had a history of making fake identification and check scams in the 90s) 

~ said she wanted me to call her mum, threatened to jump off a building if I didn’t (I still dont)

~ unbelievable lies constantly, on Facebook etc acting holier than thou)

~ racist and homophobic (even though she says she likes women, just doesn’t act on it because of the Bible 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤯)

~gets angry if she doesn’t get public credit (ie facebook post) when she visits or gives a gift etc) 

~ constantly trying to cause trouble between people especially her children, dropping little bits of information to start drama etc. plus constantly leaving her sons out of things to “have girls days” even Birthdays etc they won’t be included. 

~ have to be the center of attention at all times, wouldn’t celebrate others birthdays etc (even stole her sisters birthday and made people celebrate her on that day)

~ would end up in hospital every few months, almost dying because rather than dealing with small things she would leave them to fester and almost kill her. 

~ came to visit our son (we were in another state at the time and he was about 15m) spent the entire visit on TikTok doing terrible duos, even at the dinner table or completely ignoring us and him. Thinking she was some sort of celebrity for having a few thousand followers 🤣

~ dumped her partner and started demanding my partner help her move a week before I gave birth to my second son. (We had moved back to our home state by this point) He literally was scrubbing moldy food and her blood from the carpet and walls (apparently something to do with shooting up and squirting the blood out 🤷‍♀️) so they would get the bond back. When she kept demanding things I told her a please would be nice especially since he was busy with our eldest son and working. Or to go and help too because it was her mess. Apparently she was too tired and sore, but then was posting videos of her doing a TikTok dances in her new place. She cracked it and started sending videos to him of her crying saying that I abused her 🥴

~ after my second son was born she acted like nothing happened, visited and started demanding to my partner to set things up in her new apartment. I told her that I needed help still and to find someone else to help. She sent more videos of her crying and acting all confused saying that she thought I had ppd because I was being mean to her for no reason. 

~ last year she said that she was too sick to attend my partners birthday. Didn’t even say happy birthday to him and then posted her going out dancing the next day. Same thing with my birthday, not a peep from her. Mother’s Day rolls around and I said to my partner that it was his responsibility to get her something or call her because I was distancing myself from her. He decided to spend the day with me and our sons going out for lunch and a drive. The next day she visited and started going off about him not saying anything to her. I piped up. Hang on, you expect him to say happy Mother’s Day when you couldn’t even remember his birthday??? She was like I did so remember his birthday. I said happy birthday on my facebook page. I gave her a look and said What its too much for a text or call on your sons birthday??? You put it on your page but didn’t even tag him? She looked flabbergasted and immediately changed the subject and never brought it up again. 

Theres so many more things that I either can’t think of right now or are allot smaller, but nearly every time I have had a conversation with her and said that she was crossing my boundaries and needed to stop doing xyz (que crying and badmouthing me to everyone and my partner who has my back or just ignored her) 

So 2024s Birthday rolls around for my partner, we went away and couldn’t post anything on social media until we got back the next day. Within an hour of posting she texted my partner saying happy birthday for yesterday. Sorry I forgot about it. He said thanks and left it at that. I just blocked her. It was my final straw and I was just done with her constant me, me, me drama. I spoke to my SIL and she said she understood because it wasn’t ever going to change. 

A few months later MIL gets diagnosed with cancer on her liver, and bowels. And spreading all around, she had a big lump on her side for ages but only mentioned it when she was admitted to hospital (she had a tumor in her bowels stopping her from using the toilet) they said she’s stage 4 cancer, and will do chemotherapy to keep her alive for now. At Christmas she messaged my partner about blocking her. He ignored her. She keeps passively aggressively bringing it up to him but he just ignores it and changes the subject. I have also been grey rocking her when she visits, not being rude but very uninteresting. Last visit She started ranting about her other daughters (we are nc with this sister) husband, about how she wants to punch him in the face because he won’t call her mum or make her a coffee or will disappear when she visits her grandson. Internally I was hysterical in laughter but I just continued my cool calm demeanor because I knew that it was exactly what she was saying behind my back too. 

I don’t believe in pretending that people were great people just because they are sick or dying. But my SIL and a few others think that I’m being too harsh and that I should just pretend that I care until she’s gone. My partner supports me and says he doesn’t want to treat her differently either but has been making an effort to keep in contact with her again. Like I feel sorry for her but my life is so much more less dramatic without her constantly draining me. And lets be honest, she’s had that many health scares that her actually being gone doesn’t feel like its a real possibility anymore. I don’t feel loss at the prospect, just sadness that she wasted her life so completely and left so many lasting scars on everything she touched. 

So WIBTAH for continuing to keep her blocked, and not engaging with her at events? 

Thanks for reading such a long post if you made it to the bottom. 

Oh I thought of another one 
~ bought drugs off of someone that lived right next door to us. Told them that we were related. eventually got credit and didn’t pay. We had the dealer smashing on our door at 7am demanding to be paid, we eventually became friendly enough to the neighbors and told them what was going on with MIL. They started to sell MIL and her boyfriend super cut products and then went and bought a bunch of food for my BIL with the money (they were dealers but they still had some morals ) ",2,1737592553.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,1,1.0,False

1i7qo6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1i7qo6o/hey/,Hey,"My Love, 

To say I love you would not be enough.  What you give to me, without even knowing it, is unlike anything I've had before.  I sometimes wonder how I've made it through life this far without this for so long.  I wish there were words that could describe this feeling, I wish you could truly know it as I do.  I wish I could have told you, shown you, experienced it with you when you were still here.   I would love for you to see yourself as I do, I would love to show you how you make me feel,  I would love to give back to you what you gave to me.  

Maybe it's the little things.  The kind words you whisper to me when we are alone.  The soft and sweet smile you send my way when you know that nobody is looking.  A single wink that can make me smile on days I wouldn't otherwise be happy.   A flirty little insult that makes me laugh about myself.  Maybe its how cute you are without even knowing it.  Driving around without knowing where you are, missing obvious turns as we laugh about how distracted you are.  Writing down words your saying instead of what your thinking.   Forgetting a password you've entered in a thousand times.  Maybe its just who you are.  That kind person who is always thinking about others before themselves.  Making my coffee not because you have to, but because you want to.  Pushing me, not because I want to be pushed, but because you believe in me more than I do myself.   Pushing me not with force, but with grace, kindness, and love.  

There is no comparison to my life with or without you, only a stark contrast.   The time before you to the time after you.  There is an BC/AD stamp of time that is filled with your initials for my life.  

The joy you brought not only to me, but everyone around me, is evident.  The successes that I had were not mine, but ours.  

I'll admit you're right, but you need to admit something as well.  You may not see it, you may not get it, but anyone who has spent any time around you would tell you this:  You are rare, you are special, you are amazing, talented, and beautiful, inside and out.  You beat yourself up and don't give yourself grace you demand that I do.  But what you've taught me to do is believe what you tell me about myself.  

The things that brought you here, the trials of life, the choices we've all made to get to this point don't get to control us.  These defining moments we think we could have done differently don't get to have a place in our mind to live rent free.  Life is always full of regrets, that's how you know your alive.  We get to learn and grow, do better, be better.  Prepare for the next time, because, there is always a next time. 

I remember you, talking to me gently, comforting me after I messed up.  Not knowing if it would be fixable.  I was sitting on the front porch, some other people were around not helping me by telling me this was going to be a problem.  But you came to my side, gave me the time to collect my thoughts, sat with me silently and let me process all by myself, together.  You saved me that day. 

I'm not sure if I could define your super power or not, I just know what it is.  You.  

Maybe I cant convince you right now, maybe your too mad at yourself for how you got here.  Maybe its a pattern of decisions you see coming but cant seem to change in your life.  Maybe its where you think you should be vs where you are.  I don't know why for sure you don't see what I see, but I wanted to give you a glimpse.   

We cant be what we once were, but that's just what my head is saying, my heart gets to write it's own story.  I will never stop believing in you, I wont stop trying to show you how I see you, I wont stop trying to get you to see what I see, and I'll always love you.  

There is not anything about you I do not miss.  I am forever grateful for you, all of you.  

You are my dream, and I'm so glad I got to realize that dream, if only for a moment. ",6,1737592211.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

Latelly, astrology has been given me a lot of answers and maybe it can help me once again.

Currently I'm the owner of a small shop in my hometown but I completely hate fixed routines, the same place, the same people, the same tasks, it's just boring as hell. I completely love my hometown, but I crave getting out of here, I feel like I need to experience something new, something big!

For the last few months I have been thinking about becoming a flight attendant, I have some experience has a gate agent which might be a relevant experience but I'm worried this job might not be suitable for me... I mean I completely loooove travelling, meeting other cultures and people and my communication skills are good but I'm afraid I get bored at this job just serving coffees all day.

1i7qlne,https://www.reddit.com/r/askatherapist/comments/1i7qlne/is_there_a_name_for_this/,Is there a name for this?,"Hello, therapists. 

I had an epiphany today on the drive home. I have always struggled with impulse control related to some damaging habits of mine. For example, an impulse to binge eat. I always associated it with food addiction or the typical American attitude towards food. However, I realized that I have the same impulsive feeling when it comes to gambling, drinking, shopping, sex etc. I think it's actually a need for maximum stimulation. My life is a rollercoaster of extremes. I can't just do something part of the way. When I make dinner for my family, it has to be an elaborate affair that takes all day. When I go shopping, I have to see everything, and buy everything that I see. I have to listen to music at max volume. I can't work without watching a TV show or YouTube video. I can't watch TV without scrolling on my phone, playing a game or working on some number of hobby projects I have. Usually while drinking coffee or snacking. I need my stomach to feel uncomfortably full in the same way I need my stress level to be at the tipping point. 

Does that make sense? This isn't something I've ever been able to articulate to my therapists, and I think that has lead to some miscommunication with them. Am I on the right track that these behaviors could be intertwined? Is there a name I can put to this behavior in order to do some research? ",1,1737592012.0,askatherapist,0,1.0,False
1i7qljn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i7qljn/turning_to_reddit_for_a_reality_check/,Turning to Reddit for a reality check.,"I feel I know it but I'm clearly having attachment issues. Tell me I need to leave. Sorry this will be long.
Met this guy on tinder. We hit it off. We have the same views and goals etc. We ended up moving in with eachother. I thought I finally found the one. He and I got along great. Well shortly after it went from being excited to being ignored. I'll tell you some stories. He first didn't lend a hand in moving my things and never met the friends that helped me. I thought ok we have had the talk of him being an extreme introvert but he never wanted to meet my family either. One day I fell down the stairs because I tripped on his shoes that he likes to keep along the stairs. I said hey can we relocate these. He looks at me and says I don't understand why it's a problem now when it never has been before. I was still rehabing my broken ankle. I moved on from it like whatever I have so many other things to hold grudges on. Then one day I met him after work to eat an hr  from my work close to his. Our waitress didn't come back to the table for awhile so I got up and was looking for her. He said let's just go home. I hadn't eaten that day and I said but I'm really hungry and I'm getting antsy. He stood up looked me in the eye and said well let me one up you on that and left. I called his name and he ignored me. I called him and he began to scream at me telling me he isn't taking my attitude and this is it I make him walk on eggshells. Yall I literally go to work and come home, clean the house, I just live. I'm the chillest they come. Let me also tell you that there hasn't been a lick of intimacy since I moved in. We were on our way to go to the grocery store and he snapped at me for the way I closed the door. He then turned around and headed back home because ""he didn't want to deal with any attitude"" I talked to him and said hey whatever it is that makes you upset we need to talk about it because I am really confused. Silence. Let me skip some of the stories and now just tell you how my day to day is. I get up before him and head to work. He works from home. When I get home he is napping. He then will get up hours later, go out for coffee, not say a damn word to me unless it's all about him. Never asked how my day is or anything. Recently my mom has been in the hospital and I have communicated that to him since I have been there and at work everyday for 3 weeks. I told him this last Saturday you won't see me at all because the family is coming up to see mom in the hospital. He says ""has your mom been there this whole time"". Let me also add that he did not even say or do anything for my birthday. Nope not even a happy birthday. He hasn't joined in on the family holidays and he didn't get me anything for Xmas. I got him a few things because I'm not heartless. He got mad one time because I was in the kitchen at the same time as him. If I ask for any kind of help it's like I'm disrupting his world and I'm the annoyance. I rarely do but with my mom in the hospital I need some help. Writing this all out I think I know I need to leave but what do you label a person like him? How do I exit this peacefully? Do I just leave one day? Do I try to talk to him about it? Luckily there are no kids or assets to discuss. This one is just strange to me. I've never been where I feel lost. ",1,1737592004.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I know we both said we’ve give each other space to figure everything out but I don’t think I’ve ever changed my mind. It’s you, it’s always been you. I love you more than you’ll ever know and I hope that the universe brings us together again the right way. 

How are you doing? Are you thinking about me the way I think about you? Do you still feel the same way about me? Do you still want an us? I told you I need to let you go and in hopes that you’ll return to me, that you’ll come for me. I try to tell myself everyday that you won’t, that I need to get over you and live my life but it’s so damn hard. A small part of me dreams and hopes that you’ll show up at my door. You’re no longer blocked, I think because I hope that you’ll message me and spill it all. I check my messages and social media everyday hoping, praying for a message from you telling me you’re going to give us a chance. I know it would be hard for the both of us but it would be so worth it. If going through the trenches would lead me to you, I’d do it over and over again. 

I listen to your music every single day. I know what we had was real, I love you for who you are and not what you can give or provide or your potential. I’ve never felt so safe and accepted by someone. I wish I had known the last time I got to be near you, kiss you, touch you, was the last I would’ve made the best of it. I hope you do open your coffee business and find your happiness even if it’s not with me and I’ve always meant that. I love you so much, you always wondered how I could and I never understood how you couldn’t see it. I know I always teased you, but I had nothing but love for you. I want to crawl and live in your skin is how in love with you I am and I’ve never felt or have said that to anyone but you. You are home, you are warmth, you are my happiness. 

I visit our coffee shop any chance I get and sit there and think about us and how maybe one day we’ll have coffee again, wondering why it took us so long to be together. I still think about the trips we planned, about going to the beach together. About you seeing my favorite artist with me even though you don’t understand them. I bought tickets to their concert that is 7 months from now and dear god I wanted to message you and tell you so badly. I bought your birthday present before we ended things so abruptly and I’ve thought about dropping it off at your office when you’re not there. I’ve also thought about holding onto it because I know we’ll be together again or maybe it’s just hope. I hope you still have the cologne I bought for you. I hope you still have the coaster I made for you.  

I don’t know if we’ll ever be together, I don’t know if they’ll ever be an us or if I’ll ever hear from you again. Every time I hear or see your name being said by someone else my heart flutters. I want you to know I’m always thinking about you, I want the best for you. I want you to be happy. To see how much you deserve happiness and everything you want in life. Even though I said I wouldn’t, I’m waiting for you. I hope you see this. I hope you reach out. For now I’m letting the universe, the god(s), fate, whomever decide. Te amo, mi amor.

I’ve already browsed through previous threads a little bit and have found some spots that I saw were recommended but I just wanted to get a little more personalization. 

The lady really likes cute cafés with good coffee so I’m trying to find one for her as well as a good brunch spot because she loves brunch as well. 

I’m generally pretty easy with food I like meat and I love noodles. I love pasta. I love good carbs lol. 

If you can, please recommend any places that are kind of near us or easily accessible via public transportation we will be able to move around. I think we will be going to Granville Island, as well as the Richmond night market so if there’s anything there, please throw that out there as well. 

Here is a list of places I have so far. Not necessarily going to them all but some spots I found. Let me know if I should avoid any:

I saw him today, after 5 years of breaking up, and said hi. He glanced at me and ignored me completely. He was with his gf at a coffee shop. I figured I was being polite and it was so obvious we saw each other, I thought it best to just say hello. Is he still bitter? What's the deal? Is it because his gf is there? I thought it was the mature thing to do, and I still think that. But what does that mean if an ex flat out ignores you like that?

I got sober while taking care of my dad on hospice. He passed away on January 3 this year. I’m a wreck honestly. I’m losing the apartment and have to move in with my mother and grandma. Which is going to end up so bad. I’m almost 36. I’m divorced twice and I have nothing. This is mostly due to my addiction, I have been working so hard to improve my life. I graduate with a psychology degree in just a few months, I’m a good student and I’m a born again believer in Christ our Lord. It’s hard to admit loneliness, but that’s what I am. I cut everyone off. Then. I met this guy about 4 months ago. Unfortunately he’s everything I want and need him to be. But he can’t and won’t let go of her. Leaving me friend zoned and even ignored sometimes and worst part is that he still stays over and holds me at night and makes coffee for me in the morning. No sex, just intimacy and I hate it. Because I know it’ll never be anything more and I’ll never be enough. That always seems to be it. I’m only good enough for a moment and not forever. And I’m a good person. I’m loving and caring, genuine. The list can go on. But I just keep getting hurt and the next time is worse than the last. I’m so tired of feeling not good enough when I know I am. I’m emotionally drained and exhausted. I’m so sad and angry at the same time and I feel completely helpless and invisible. And I’m at the end of my rope.

But I recall she often says either both of us aren’t really dressed well or we both put no effort. As someone who’s currently doing wfh, hanging out with friends is the one time I feel like dressing up. So it kinda got me bummed she often says we are dressed bad or casual.

I did my makeup and my hair, wore some boots and jeans with a top & coat. While that might seem rather casual, I’m not a dress girl and definitely don’t feel comfy in skirts especially in the colder weather. She had on some leggings and a sweater. One time when we met up we did so for a quick midday coffee. She commented on how I always look so comfy. I had a matching sweats and sweatshirt on, and I felt like wow if she saw me in my really casual outfit she’d have something to say.. 

Also this friend commented she found it admirable I can do elaborate makeup and feel comfortable wearing a “bummy outfit”.

I'm sitting here relaxing my feet in a foot spa drinking a delicious Starbucks favorite of mine and flipping through ambient videos to try and find the most relaxing one and listening to my silly little budgies chirp back and forth. All because of him. All because l'm appreciated and I'm cherished.

All because someone actually wants to make me feel good about myself and do things for me with absolute willingness to do it. I don't think I'll ever get used to it, honestly. I'm glad I gave love a chance again.

Over the past decade, we’ve been deep in the trenches of running and marketing a small coffee shop. It’s been an incredible journey filled with trial and error, a ton of caffeine, and plenty of lessons learned. Recently, we launched [NinjaPop.io](https://ninjapop.io) to help other small businesses grow, and I wanted to share some insights that might help you too.

# The Lessons We Learned:

1. **Google Business Profiles Are GOLD** 🏆 Seriously, if you’re not optimizing your Google Business Profile (GBP), you’re leaving money on the table. Most of our foot traffic came from people searching for “coffee near me.” Adding photos, responding to reviews, and using the right keywords made a huge difference for us.
2. **Reviews Build Trust** People trust other people’s experiences. We found that even one 5-star review could bring in a wave of new customers. But let’s be real—getting reviews consistently isn’t easy, especially when everyone’s busy.
3. **Consistency > Flashiness** Fancy marketing campaigns are great, but what really worked was showing up consistently. Posting daily on social media, keeping our website updated, and engaging with our customers made us stand out.
4. **Give People a Reason to Choose You** Whether it’s offering a free sample, hosting community events, or planting a tree for every review (yes, we do this now with Ninja Pop 🌱), giving customers a reason to engage with your brand creates loyalty.
5. **Automation Saves Time and Sanity** We started automating review requests, follow-ups, and even social media posts toward the end, and it was a game changer. It freed us up to focus on what we loved—serving our customers.

### **Chapter XII: A Brother’s Bond**

The café in Mayagüez sat at the intersection of two bustling streets, its outdoor tables lit softly by warm lamps that created pools of light on the cobblestone. It was a modest establishment, far from the grandeur of New San Juan, but Sebastián Montalvo had insisted on meeting there. He needed a place with ordinary rhythm, where life was simpler, where the hum of conversation and the scent of freshly brewed coffee could drown out the weight in his thoughts.

Carlos Montalvo y Estrella, his younger brother and a senator with an ever-expanding influence, sat across from him. The two shared the same sharp features, though Carlos’s eyes were warmer, less clouded by the burdens of leadership.

“You’ve been quiet, Sebastián,” Carlos said, tilting his coffee. “Unusual for you.”

Sebastián glanced at him, offering a faint smile. “Just listening. It’s been a while since I could sit like this—hear the laughter, the conversations, the world turning without me having to push it.”

Carlos chuckled. “The world turns doesn't because of people like you, Sebastián. Don’t kid yourself.”

---

Navigating Policy Through Influence

As they spoke, a middle-aged man approached hesitantly. He wore a worn shirt and carried a straw hat, twisting it nervously in his hands.

“Governor Montalvo,” the man began, addressing Sebastián with the title many still used despite his departure from office. “My apologies for interrupting, but I just wanted to say thank you. My daughter was treated at the clinic in Vega Alta. Without it, we wouldn’t have made it.”

Sebastián stood, shaking the man’s hand warmly. “I’m glad the clinic was able to help. It was built for families like yours. Please, give your daughter my best.”

As the man departed, Carlos raised an eyebrow. “You still wield influence, even without a title. It’s remarkable—and a little unnerving.”

Sebastián sat back down, his expression thoughtful. “Influence is a double-edged sword, Carlos. It can move mountains, but it can also cut deeply if wielded carelessly.”

Carlos leaned forward. “So, how do you wield it now? You’ve got a hand in the House of Lords, the Intelligentsia, the R.I.S., Atlas, labor unions—your reach extends farther than most active governors.”

Sebastián stirred his coffee absently. “Carefully, and only when necessary. I’ve learned that sometimes the best way to lead is to step back and let others find their strength.”

---

The Young Man’s Plea

The conversation was interrupted by a young man approaching their table. He clutched a folded piece of paper, his face a mix of nerves and determination.

“Governor Montalvo,” he began, his voice trembling slightly, “my family owns a small business here in Mayagüez. We’ve been struggling with the new taxes. I… I don’t know where else to turn. Is there any way you could help?”

Sebastián took the paper, unfolding it carefully. It contained a detailed plea for a reprieve from the increased taxation under Barrera’s administration.

“I can’t promise immediate action,” Sebastián said gently, “but I’ll have someone review this. Your voice deserves to be heard.”

The young man nodded, his gratitude evident. “Thank you, Governor. Truly.”

As he walked away, Carlos smirked. “And how exactly are you going to handle that, big brother? You don’t have executive authority anymore.”

---

Strategy Over Coffee

Sebastián leaned back, his gaze drifting to the bustling street. “The taxes are suffocating small businesses. Barrera’s austerity measures are short-sighted—they bleed the people dry while benefitting people who are forced to awkwardly shun his relief; his plans have proven through the years, by others weilding those same arguments, to fail in fostering growth in the ways that matter.”

“And what would you do?” Carlos pressed.

Sebastián’s expression sharpened. “I’d ease taxation on essential industries—our industries, agriculture, trade, local manufacturing. In exchange, I’d incentivize reinvestment into the community: hiring locals, funding clinics, supporting schools. Growth in 9 years would offset the initial revenue loss.”

Carlos leaned forward, intrigued. “And how do you make that happen without being governor?”

Sebastián smirked. “I don’t. But I can influence those who are. The House of Lords, the unions, even Barrera’s allies—if they all have a stake in Puerto Rico’s future. They just need to be reminded of it.”

Carlos shook his head, laughing softly. “You always make it sound so simple. But you know as well as I do, politics is a mess.”

Sebastián raised his coffee cup in a mock toast. “True. But messes are my specialty.”

A Glimpse of Hope

As the brothers prepared to leave, Sebastián glanced at the folded paper in his hand. It wasn’t much—a single voice among many—but it was a reminder of why he continued to fight, even without a formal title.

Carlos watched him, his expression softening. “You really can’t stop, can you?”

Sebastián shook his head, a faint smile playing on his lips. “Not while there’s work to be done.”

As they conversed sat beside the cobblestone street, the city around them alive with the humble bustle of evening life, Sebastián felt his sense of purpose renewed. He might not ever hold the governor’s seat again, but his influence was far from diminished.",1,1737591074.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

The angel shows me ￼that you’re my butterfly, unwrapping my cocoon to breathe life and open my wings to live life again, to feel free and alive. In that short moment, I realised how much I had forgotten myself ￼ I forgot who I am. I realised that I needed ￼time to step away from the battles, still helping my children but remembering my mum, but I still needed to live life ￼
I also realised ￼I was drowning in this illness where I forgot myself; that’s when you Thomas my sexy fuck ￼!!!
You turned a switch in me where this brightness shines so strong ￼no way in hell  I wanted that dark place could stay a moment. You awakened my soul so deeply, so passionately, that it felt like Al Souls had reconnected after travelling thur many years miles, constantly feeling an empty void ￼ in my sexy. This is what made sense to me. Oh, in first encounter was so intense beyond what we can on earth comprehend as ￼you grabbed me around my neck, what I craved for never brave enough to ask my exes, but here you come, and you gave me every think at that moment that was only meant to have coffee babe, and I felt saved and so fucking sexy ￼ grab me around my neck. It was almost like we perfected our lovemaking from having a long relationship, but really, we only met that day, and I have never experienced a moment that intense ￼￼ and real lord help me fight this depression

I didn't participate in formal rush this year because it took place during the same time as a winter class that I was taking. Round Robins and House Tours took place during the time I was required to be in class. I've reached out to some sororities who have COB spots open, and I managed to set up a coffee date with one, but I feel I'm greatly disadvantaged as a junior (I transferred to my school last year).

Ending it on my birthday..","my entire life I have made to feel outcasted from my own family, age 5 my mom marries someone who turns out to be a pedophile and does stuff to me and forces me to do stuff to him and my cousins while he watches. this goes on from age 5 to 8.

he also would beat me so badly to where I could barely sit because it would hurt. this went on from age 5 to 17.

When I was 8 my cousins dad came over no other adults were around. he made us kids do things to each other for hours then left. we never told anyone.

My mom never believed me nor did my grandma or any one else in the family. I was always called a liar, trash, stupid, and many other words. growing up I barely learned how to read and could barely spell. everyone made fun of me growing up. 

I never went to school, was always kept home to work in the yard or to handmow 10 acres of land or work in the field we had.
When I was 17, my step dad killed my 80 year old grandma who had severe asthma, he sprayed a full can of bug spray in the kitchen causing her to have a severe asthma attack and died that night. he did it on purpose for the will.

when I was 18 I walked in on my step dad and my moms uncle together in her bed. I told her that night infront of everyone, he threw hot coffee in my face and then my mom kicked me out of the house.

My mom was always trying to end her life, I grew up spending weeks in and out of the hospital by her bedside from overdoses. 

Was homeless from age 18 to 35. no one would hire me.
Lost my mom when I was 25, my biological dad when I was 23, only knew him for a few months. 

Didn't learn to read or write until I was 18/19 and homeless. That is also when I learned I had dyslexia and minor brain damage from years of beatings from my step dad.

Fast forward to today after 30 years of abuse from my family. my aunts, my cousins and being outcasted by them for over 10 years. I am turning 44 monday and I can't keep living like this.

I was diagnosed with Cptsd, severe chronic depression, paranoia, severe social anxiety and suicidal ideation. I have no friends and go months with no one to talk to, i have no one to game with and I have no support from anyone. I owe 3 years of payments on 3 different credit cards and I am -180 in the bank and living on ssi. I can't keep going like this...

I have never had a girlfriend, women don't want me, I have never had a vehicle and I desperately need a minivan to help me get around to places. I had a crown break off and can't get to a dentist because of no dental insurance. I was never taught dental hygiene growing up and now I need all of my teeth pulled and dentures but cannot afford it.

I live in a very small town in texas that is 30 miles away from anything and have to doordash everything which costs so much. 

I can't keep living like this and being completely alone all of the time. So I am ending it on my birthday on the 27th.",3,1737590744.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False
1i7q4ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVC_Survivors_Help/comments/1i7q4ad/magnesium_helped_control_my_pvcs/,Magnesium helped control my PVCs,"I just wanted to share something that’s really made a difference for me in managing my PVCs, and I thought it might be helpful to some of you who are dealing with the same thing. I’ve had PVCs for a while now, and they’ve been so unpredictable—some days they’re barely noticeable, and other days, it feels like my heart is skipping beats all day long. It’s super frustrating, especially when you can’t really pinpoint why it’s happening.

A while ago, I started noticing a pattern. Whenever I had a lot of coffee, my PVCs seemed to get a lot worse. It wasn’t an immediate thing, but a few hours after having my usual two cups in the morning, my heart would start doing its thing. I’d feel the fluttering in my chest, and I’d get really anxious about it, which of course just made it worse.

Then, I came across a few posts talking about how magnesium can help with heart rhythm issues. I’d heard of magnesium before, but I never really thought about how it could affect my PVCs specifically. I decided to give it a try and started taking magnesium 400mg regularly. I wasn’t sure it would help, but after about a few hours or so, I started noticing fewer PVCs, especially on days when I had coffee. It was kind of a relief!

Now, I don’t completely cut out coffee, but I’m way more mindful of how much I drink. I also make sure I take my magnesium every day, and it’s made a huge difference. If I forget to take it for a couple of days, I can definitely feel the difference—my PVCs start to come back, and the anxiety kicks in.

I’m not saying magnesium is the answer for everyone, but for me, it’s been a really helpful addition to my routine. I just wanted to share in case anyone else is dealing with similar issues. If you haven’t tried magnesium yet, it might be worth considering. Just thought I’d throw this out there in case it helps someone else!

Anyone else had any success with magnesium or noticed coffee making their PVCs worse? Would love to hear your thoughts!",1,1737590691.0,PVC_Survivors_Help,0,1.0,False

1i7pxmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1i7pxmj/we_spent_10_years_marketing_a_small_business/,We spent 10 years marketing a small business (coffee shop) and here's what learned,"Hey Reddit! 👋

Over the past decade, we’ve been deep in the trenches of running and marketing a small coffee shop. It’s been an incredible journey filled with trial and error, a ton of caffeine, and plenty of lessons learned. Recently, we launched [NinjaPop.io](https://ninjapop.io) to help other small businesses grow, and I wanted to share some insights that might help you too.

# The Lessons We Learned:

1. **Google Business Profiles Are GOLD** 🏆 Seriously, if you’re not optimizing your Google Business Profile (GBP), you’re leaving money on the table. Most of our foot traffic came from people searching for “coffee near me.” Adding photos, responding to reviews, and using the right keywords made a huge difference for us.
2. **Reviews Build Trust** People trust other people’s experiences. We found that even one 5-star review could bring in a wave of new customers. But let’s be real—getting reviews consistently isn’t easy, especially when everyone’s busy.
3. **Consistency > Flashiness** Fancy marketing campaigns are great, but what really worked was showing up consistently. Posting daily on social media, keeping our website updated, and engaging with our customers made us stand out.
4. **Give People a Reason to Choose You** Whether it’s offering a free sample, hosting community events, or planting a tree for every review (yes, we do this now with Ninja Pop 🌱), giving customers a reason to engage with your brand creates loyalty.
5. **Automation Saves Time and Sanity** We started automating review requests, follow-ups, and even social media posts toward the end, and it was a game changer. It freed us up to focus on what we loved—serving our customers.

# How [**NinjaPop.io**](http://NinjaPop.io) Was Born

After years of manually doing all this, we realized other small business owners could benefit from what we’d learned. So, we created [**NinjaPop.io**](https://ninjapop.io), a platform designed to make Google reviews easy and fun:  
  
✅ Automated texts and emails to request reviews after a transaction  
✅ Google Business Profile optimization (keywords, photos, posts—you name it!)  
✅ A tree planted for every review 🌳  
✅ Automatic posting of 5-star reviews to your social media 🎉

Our goal? To help **1,000 small businesses** grow this year.

# Why We’re Sharing This

Running a small business is hard, and we know how overwhelming marketing can feel. If you’re struggling with reviews or your GBP, give Ninja Pop a look. We’re a small business helping other small businesses—no corporate vibes here. 💪

I wanted to share my story in case it provides any insight to someone going through what I went through, and to provide some closure for myself.

I was looking forward to breastfeeding so much, but it didn't work out after an emergency c section, neonatal resuscitation, and a shallow latch that left me bleeding. We tried, but my supply wasn't increasing and my baby was hungry. We switched to formula and pumping what I could. I tried everything to increase my supply - pumping every 1-3 hours, power pumps, all the supplements, lots of water/calories, trying 6 different pumps. Nothing really did it. I just hit 5 months and the most I have produced in a day is 6.5 ounces. It's not much, but I am proud to have provided even something for my baby. 

My baby got COVID about 3 weeks ago, and so did myself and my husband. Caring for s feverish baby who won't sleep unless she is rocked, while also caring for a sick husband, being sick myself, and simply not sleeping took it's toll on my supply. I pumped when I could but it decreased by about a third. Thats not much in ounces - but I worked really hard to get to 6.5 ounces a day, and I knew it would take a month or two to get back there. I am back at work now, and I simply don't have the time or energy, and pumping 6-8 times a day to get less than 5 ounces just makes me sad. But, my breast milk helped my baby through COVID. I am so very proud of that. 

I am in the process of weaning now. I am pretty sad about it - I kept thinking I would find the magic thing to increase my supply, but I never did, and now I know I never will. I am trying to look to the positive and think of all the things that could be better. I won't have to spend 30 min in the morning pumping and can instead spend that precious time with my baby. I won't have to clean pump parts anymore!! I won't cry when I give my baby her one precious bottle of breast milk a day and she leaves 3 ounces.  I can go out of the house without working around the every-3-hour schedule. I won't have to wear the wearable pumps at work anymore. I can have coffee and alcohol again if I want.

He said it was really good. I went on to use the very little groceries around the house to make food for our daughter and I. 

What im trying to say is, I’m really the one who feeds our daughter. I’ve literally seen him feed himself before our daughter when she’s obviously hungry. 

The few times he’s cooked dinner for “us” he’ll only make one plate and says he like “sharing with me” but hogs the plate and eats most of it. He rarely provides groceries for us, and when he does he’s kind of mean about it… I’m a stay at home mom with no income. I’ll have to fight for the smallest things but he’ll get nice things for himself  (fancy cheeses, drinks, coffees) and have it right in front of us. 

Of course I’m always making sure our daughter is more than fed, I bake sourdough treats and fun foods with what I have (she’s still full time breastfeeding too) I always have her eat before me or with me. 

But I, (26F, 120lbs) also enjoy eating. Especially when I was pregnant and postpartum, then and still full time breastfeeding. I guess as long as baby is fed then I’m more than okay. But it’s hard on my body when I feel like I don’t eat enough, I eat normally when he’s not around, but when he is, it’s challenging. 

I’ve never had an eating disorder, and I’m pretty fit, healthy, and low weight. (Not that I should even have to say that) I’m just wondering why it’s like this..

Is this is wrong, weird, uncomfortable, or hurtful or am I just honestly overreacting.

(Bear with me, English isn't my first language)

Yesterday, I matched with a guy on Tinder. At first,  it was a normal conversation and then we exchanged our Instagram accounts. For the record, I usually date tall and slim guys. It's my preference and sometimes I feel guilty about it. I myself am really thin and normal height (like 5'4/1.65 cm).
 I gave this guy like bc I really liked his hair. However, neither his Tinder account nor his Instagram show a full picture of him.

On Instagram, we started chatting normally and asking questions to get to know each other. He expressed he wanted a serious relationship and I said I didn't know what I really wanted bc in the past I didn't have good experience with guys. But we could get to know each other.
Then, he started telling me how beautiful I was and he didn't get why I was still single. Also, he said he was shocked on how different I was from other women who often offered him only sex and I was a little cold and direct with my answers to his questions (I wasn't really buying this narrative bc usually I'm suspicious about love bombing and all that stuff)
 Long story short, he said he'd love to be in a relationship with me and he asked me what kind of man I liked, I explained what I mentioned before tall, thin guys with beautiful smile. He said okay, and asked on a date (just going for ice-cream) which I accepted thinking it was just to chat and see if I like him.
Also, I explained to him that when I don't like a guy physically something in me switch and I'm not interested in the guy in question. He said it was okay.
Something that also made me think was the fact that he was so opened about his life, sharing so much about private details and describing himself as a ""broken man"". I'm someone who keeps my situations private and I don't overshare. 
Anyway, that same night he called me bc he wanted to hear my voice and confessed that he felt really attracted to me and he really liked me. I said to him that first we had to meet in person and see if we felt attracted to each other before expressing such fragile feelings. 
Then, he asked me if I liked him which I reply I didn't know but he kept insisting and I replied many times that we knew each other for a couple of hours (not even 24 hrs). We talk for an 1 hour. He said he'd like to know if I liked him or not during the date and I said I'd let him know. Then we said goodbye and went to sleep not thanking much about the situation. 

Moving on today, we had our date. Guys when I saw him I was gagged, he was opposite to what I described to my ""ideal man"". He was not too tall and was chubby. While I was walking towards him I thought ""he lied to me"".
I guess he noticed something off with me and asked me if I was okay. I said I was but in reality I just wanna leave. But I also felt conflictive bc I thought I was a bad person to have this kind of preferences. 
Anyway, we were in the cafe and he asked me right away if I liked him. I said I didn't know (to not hurt him) but then I decided to be honest and I said that he knew I like tall guys and he wasn't. His face change so much and he seemed extremely sad and I felt such a horrible person to make that human being sad.
I think my face expression changed and he asked If I was comfortable. I said no and then he said he was sad to make me feel that guy. And he said that even though I didn't like him we could enjoy that afternoon talking which I thought was a good idea. I felt relaxed when my ice coffee arrived and he started chatting about random stuff.
However, I started looking at him and I thought he had a handsome face and good hair. He noticed that I was contemplating him and took my hand and kissed it. I was a little bit shocked but I let him kissing my hand (that was my mistake). Then, he actually kissed me (my second mistake). I liked his kisses but didn't say I was going to be his girlfriend. Then, we left the cafe and went to a store and there he continued kissing me whenerver he had the opportunity ( my mistake too I know 😔 but I was a little bit happy). Then we went to a park chat more and there he kissed me more, he said he couldn't believe how beautiful I was, that I was a gift from heaven, that he was going to take care of me, that if I was with him  he'd love me so much. He sometimes said some poetics stuff which made me feel weird but I thought maybe I should give a chance to this guy. He seemed so sweet and lovely that I definitely I could get to love him. But deep down I felt weird, like something was off. 

My other mistake was going to my apartment, my cousin was there so I thought we could watch a movie while eating something but then my cousin went out with some friends and we stayed alone at my place. He started kissing me again and things got really heated. You could imagine what happen, we ended up having sex. There I realized how far he was from my type of man and something in his eyes turned me off, like he was getting what he actually wanted and I was the stupid who allowed it. I felt so weird, he noticed and he stopped. Suddenly, I started crying, couldn't understand well what was happening with me, I couldn't recognize my feelings about the whole situation. 
I got up and got dressed and then I went to my living room trying to process whar just happened. He got dressed and he had this face of the worst victim in history. I felt so terrible but then he said he wasn't born to be happy and I said to him that was manipulation. He said it wasn't and he said I didn't get how much he liked me. I pointed out that we started talking yesterday and it was impossible he felt so deep regarding me.
He asked me if I could think about the situation and about him with a really sad voice. That he'd wait for me till I was ready to be with him. Then I said to him "" see, I told you I didn't like chubby guys"" I know it was terrible 😔 and I felt the worst villain in history. Because of it, he got up from the couch and picked his stuff and left.
Then he blocked me from Instagram. 
So now I'm here trying to process this situation, asking myself if I'm a horrible person.
 Please guys tell me your thoughts. I'll read them.

Recently my GERD reactivated and I have a dull pressure on the left side of my chest. I keep getting worried I’m having a heart attack but I think it’s just gas build up in my chest. I must of reactivated my GERD with too much coffee, caffeine, fried foods and spicy/salty. Now paying for it dearly. I am burping a lot and it’s making me anxious. I had my heart checked extensively 6 months ago and my heart is supposedly very healthy.  Does anyone else get the full pressure left side of chest? Can anyone confirm it’s gas build up?

I’m trying to open a small bakery/coffee shop and the space currently has that lifeproof click board flooring sitting on top of wood. 

I’ve been going back and forth with my health department about what materials I can use for the floor because apparently all of the sheet vinyl available from Home Depot or other diy sites is not commercial grade and the only commercial grade sheet vinyl I’ve been able to find, the company won’t sell to you unless you’ve been trained in how to install it and own a flooring business.

Are any of these other ones a good DIY option? I’m trying to do it cheaply but I literally only need 120 sq ft of space floored with commercial grade stuff.

1i7pk3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i7pk3u/i_25m_abruptly_ghosted_after_a_fantastic_first/,I (25M) abruptly Ghosted after a fantastic first date (23F). Confused.,"I saw a girl on Tinder (she actually had her Instagram in her Tinder bio) and I messaged her on Instagram, shooting my shot. She was 100% my type and super super cute. Low digital footprint as well, which is very attractive to me.


It was received well after a couple jokes/pickup lines, so we started texting and planned to have coffee 2 days from then. We texted over those couple of days, not a ton, but stayed in touch. 





When the date came, we were both nervous, but warmed up to eachother really quickly. She was gorgeous, even cuter in person. Our conversation flowed so well and we both got pretty comfortable with each other pretty quickly. Shared a ton of laughs, basically every physical sign that someone is interested was apparent. Her only red flag was she was about a month out of a relationship that had been quite rocky the past few months. We discussed it and she made it very clear that was said and done and that she was no longer in contact. We both also agreed we liked moving slowly. 


The conversation was going so well that we went and had dinner together, which wasn’t planned. We had the same deal over dinner. Tons of talking, laughing, etc. We shared some very personal traits/struggles we both had in common and I felt like I was starting to form a bond with this girl. Our compatibility was off the charts and we were both really feeling eachother. 




After dinner when going out to our cars, she had a nerf gun in hers, so we both took turns shooting eachother with it in the parking lot. It was silly and felt very movie-esque, but it was fun honestly, lol. I felt like my guard was down entirely with her and I was really starting to have feelings for her.



We went our separate ways and when I got home, I texted her and we texted a bit about how we had fun and I told her I look forward to seeing her again soon. I then went to bed.





The next day, I texted her about one of my professors having a funny name (she is also going back to school), to which she responded and I told her I’ll expect the same stories from her when she starts school. 


She didn’t respond all day. I brushed it off as her being busy. Next day, Wednesday comes along. Nothing from her. Oh well, maybe she’s busy. 


Thursday comes along with nothing and she posts stuff on her Instagram story, odd, but don’t want to be clingy or annoying so I hold off. 


Saturday comes along and I give in and text her “Hi. Busy after work Tuesday/Wednesday?”. I get no response. She continues to post on her story.





I ended up texting her last night asking why I was being ghosted, which of course, got no response. In retrospect, not a good play, but don’t think it really did much as it appears she had made her mind. I just kinda wanted an explanation or reason as to why I got left in the dust seemingly out of nowhere.


I guess I’m just confused as to WTF happened? Things were going great and seemingly out of nowhere she lost all interest and dropped me at what should’ve been peak excitement. I don’t get it. ",2,1737589187.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False
1i7pjyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1i7pjyv/46yearold_attorney_severely_floxxed_from_one/,46-year-old attorney severely floxxed from one Cipro 250,"Last June I was prescribed Cipro for a prostatitis I didn't actually have. I took one Cipro 250 before bedtime the night I got out of the emergency room. Within a few hours, at 2 a.m., I woke up and my arms and legs were on fire. I was unable to fall back asleep that night because of the intense burning in my arms and legs and severe anxiety. By 8 AM I had bilateral achilles tendinopathy, weakness in my hands, arms, and legs, and severe cramping in my calves. It was like a bomb went off in my body.  My joints were all cracking. It felt like they were made of glass. Just turning over in bed was excruciating.

I could not walk, so I ordered a pair of crutches and a wheelchair for Amazon next-day delivery. When I went back to the emergency room three days after being floxxed, the ER doctor tried to gaslight me, telling me it wasn’t the Cipro and recommended steroids. At this point, I had already read PubMed research articles detailing that steroids would make tendon ruptures significantly more likely, and I said no. In those early days, I read everything I could find and watched everything I could watch. I read every single PubMed research article on fluoroquinolone and fluoroquinolone toxicity. I read Dr. Pieper‘s book on FQAD cover to cover half a dozen times. I read almost every single relevant post on this sub and all of the comments.  I watched every YouTube video of people that have been floxxed.

For months, I had peripheral neuropathy in my lower arms and legs that kept me from sleeping.  I was anxious, depressed, and suicidal. Tendinopathy was widespread and affecting my achilles, knees, hamstrings, hands, wrists, elbows, biceps, shoulders, and even my jaw.

Three weeks into this, my bicep tendons were hurting so badly that I could no longer get around on the manual wheelchair. I ordered a power wheelchair because I couldn’t get to the bathroom or the kitchen or anywhere else. It was so bad that I rented a power wheelchair while the one that I ordered could get delivered.

I saw more emergency room doctors, my primary, a rheumatologist, and had someone coming to my house for physical therapy.

Six weeks into this, I hurt both of my wrists and hands, and for the next several months, I was completely crippled. I  could neither walk nor use my hands at all. I was hospitalized, and the first thing they recommended was administering steroids, which I explained would make me worse. I ended up leaving the hospital against medical advice when it became obvious that I literally knew more about fluoroquinolone toxicity than every doctor and nurse I interacted with. In fact none of them had heard of anything like this. My girlfriend is a doctor and we both understood that there was nothing they could do for me, and they would probably make it worse.

My mother cooked and cleaned; she fed me like I was a baby again. My father shaved me. My girlfriend brushed and flossed my teeth and bathed me. When my parents went back home after three months, one of my adult children stayed with me for three months and literally fed me like I was baby.

I couldn’t hold a toothbrush, or a fork, or a bottle of water. Someone had to do everything for me. I couldn’t swipe or touch the screen on an iPad or iPhone without excruciating pain, let alone hold the device. I learned to use accessibility settings and use my voice to control my devices. I love playing chess and couldn't even do that until I found an app that allowed me to call out my moves using my voice. I was suicidal and cried all the time.

I was always fatigued; my gums were bleeding; my mouth was dry; the peripheral neuropathy was driving me insane. I also had severe back and neck pain, myoclonic jerks, and certain things I used to eat without issue would exacerbate my peripheral neuropathy. 

I ordered an adjustable mattress and spent most of my time in bed reading about fluoroquinolone toxicity, crying, and feeling sorry for myself. I also spent a lot of time on this sub reading any story that might give me hope. Someone had posted about golfing 13 months into this and I tried to believe that could be me too. Although it was pretty distressing that it seemed like my case was much more severe than most people on the sub.

After a few months I saw a neurology doctor and he recommended I take steroids, at this point I was sick of doctors trying to get me to take something that would make me worse and I literally told him I wasn't taking any fu$$ing steroids. I was angry at the doctors that caused this and the ones that were trying to make it worse. I was also furious at the pharmacist that didn’t properly warn me. (I asked if there was anything I should know about this medication and the pharmacist told me to drink less coffee while I was on it)  I was beyond angry and frustrated.

I’ve seen neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, podiatrists, rheumatologists, PMR doctors, physical therapists, and emergency medicine doctors.

I have had MRIs of my ankles, my brain, my lumbar and cervical spine and my wrists and hands.  The MRIs of my ankles showed achilles tendinopathy and fluid accumulation. There was also a herniated disc in both my lumbar and cervical spine.  The MRI of my wrists and hands were mostly normal although I couldn't use my hands at all. That one pill really messed me up.

It has now been almost 8 months since I was floxxed. Despite being bedridden for about half a year, completely unable to walk, or feed, dress, or bath myself, I have started to significantly improve. Here's what I did.

""Let food be thy medicine."" Organic whole foods, no sugar (it flared me), no processed foods (it flared me), no alcohol. I pretty much ate the same things every day for six months.

I had eggs, tomatoes, avocado, and sauerkraut every day for breakfast. 

At 11 a.m. and 2:30 PM I had a shake with sprouted rolled oats, sprouted pumpkin seeds, shelled hemp seeds, chia seeds, bananas, kale, strawberries, blueberries, dragon fruit, oat milk, peanut butter, collagen peptides, and kefir. All organic. These shakes had tons of protein, magnesium, vitamin C, and other nutrients. 

For dinner every day, I had either mushrooms, salmon, or chicken breast with an assortment of vegetables, avocado, tomato, and either brown rice or potatoes, with a side of sauerkraut. 

This diet was meant to be anti-inflammatory, high in protein, fiber, magnesium, vitamin C, and other nutrients. The sauerkraut and kefir were natural probiotics to help heal my gut. 

In addition, I also supplemented magnesium glycinate, vitamin D3 + K2, ashwagandha, CoQ10, calcium, vitamin C, PQQ, hyaluronic acid, boron, and type 1, type 2, and type 3 collagen in a blend of amino acids that  included hydroxyproline and proline among others. All recommended doses on the labels.

I also had ginger tea with fresh ginger twice a day every day. One with breakfast, and one before bed.  I took melatonin every night, and four months into this, I started taking gabapentin for nerve pain and to increase my deep sleep.

I iced painful tendons several times a day. And I used heating pads to improve blood flow and circulation several times a day as well.

Almost 8 months out, and I’m no longer using the $5,000 power wheelchair I bought, or the wheelchair ramps installed at my home, or the crutches, or walker, or the Richie Aero Spring carbon fiber braces that were made for me. I can walk again, albeit slowly.  I can drive. I can ride a bicycle.

I did three months of occupational therapy for my hands and wrists, and I’ve done almost 2 months of physical therapy for the rest of my body so far. (I started PT outside of the home at the 6 month mark)  If there was a part of my body in severe pain, I would rest it, but when the pain would subside, I would purposely move it as best I could.  It seems like tendons are not likely to fully recover without physical therapy and progressively loading them. During the ""acute phase"" I would err on the side of caution and rest.

I’ve gone from taking zero steps other than transferring from my wheelchair to my bed and from my wheelchair to a toilet, to about 4-5000 steps a day.

For anyone reading this feeling hopeless right now, I spent months feeling like I would rather die than go on living like this, and I had a hard time believing things would improve, but I promise you things will improve.",13,1737589176.0,floxies,10,1.0,False

I had the endoscopy yesterday, and now I'm waiting for the pathology results. The GI doctor told me that my esophagus looks terrible and I definitely need to take a PPI and come back in three months for another endoscopy to see if it is healing. This is from the doctor's report: 

Mucosal changes including white plaques were found in the middle third   
of the esophagus. Biopsies were obtained from the proximal and distal   
esophagus with cold forceps for histology of suspected eosinophilic   
esophagitis.  
LA Grade C (one or more mucosal breaks continuous between tops of 2 or   
more mucosal folds, less than 75% circumference) esophagitis with no   
bleeding was found in the distal esophagus.  
A mild Schatzki ring was found at the gastroesophageal junction.  
The entire examined stomach was normal.  
The examined duodenum was normal. Biopsies for histology were taken with   
a cold forceps for evaluation of celiac disease.

I'm kind of surprised that it's so bad, since my symptoms really haven't been terrible. Could this cause voice changes and difficulty reading aloud for long periods? That's something that has happened gradually and I just chalked up to middle age woes. 

Will the pathology definitively tell me if I have EoE or celiac? Is it even possible to suddenly have celiac disease at 46 years old? I don't feel bad after I eat wheat, or anything else really. I just can't have really acidic food before bed. And sometimes I get heartburn from drinking coffee. ",2,1737589116.0,EosinophilicE,2,1.0,False

So, the year’s come to a close, cuffing season is upon us and I’m still single, I feel like it’s time to finally change that. I’ve been looking on and off for about a year now and I’ve decided to give it one more shot and I’m going about it with a better mindset now I think.

I’ll get to the point, I aim to date to marry, I’d say I bring a lot to the table, and my ideal man would be someone who feels similar too. I think a relationship is best when we both bring equal value to the relationship, even if we aren’t necessarily equals in every way. I prefer a man who can lead, but not one who is abusive, or unnecessarily bossy. I want something real and healthy, just also traditional.

I’m religious, however you don’t have to be as long as you can respect that I am. I lean conservative, however I’m not rabid in my views and if you aren’t either. That shouldn’t be a problem either! 

Day to day you’ll find me in a gym, at my desk, in a coffee shop, on a hiking trail, with friends or, when I’m very lucky, in a swimming pool. I’m a pretty active and outdoorsy person, so if you’re a man who can pitch a tent, build a fire, chop wood (yum) we will definitely get on. I also love the gym, but if isn’t your idea of fun, that’s okay, just as long as you’re healthy and in good shape overall. I plan on living a long time, and I want a big family, so I want a man who I can do that with!

Physically, I’m not super picky, I’m short so most of you reading this will be much taller than me. Pretty much just be put together, hygienic and a decent weight for your height. I do love a nice beard and smile though. I’m blonde, athletic and I can clean up nicely and rock a nice dress when the occasion demands it, but day to day I’m either in gym clothes or comfy clothes. 

Touched on this earlier but I want a big family one day, ideally at least 3-5 kids (hopefully more tbh) so hopefully that’s your dream too. I have a stable career currently but after kids I’d probably prefer to stay home, it’s what my mom did for me, and I think it’s best for kids and everyone else as well. Kids need a consistent parent around. My dream is to move into the country somewhere, with a good school nearby, a good community and nature right at our doorstep. Think a modern homestead type of vibe.

1i7pdb4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i7pdb4,Need help furnishing my living room!,"Moved into this new apartment and have almost no furniture for the living room, trying to plan it out but i’m having trouble envisioning a good layout. 

most important to me are: 
- couch (or sectional) with chaise
- 65-75” TV
- i already have a coffee table, but i’m not too attached to it, i wouldn’t be against getting a different one

the reason i’m having trouble is the fireplace. i could mount a tv up there but anything larger than a 65” would hang over the edges, also not sure i like the TV being so high. i could put a couch in front of it but then you have all that awkward space on either side. if I put a tv on the left wall then i’m blocking the windows plus that wall is banked so i’m not sure it would fit heightwise.

1i7pc01,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i7pc01/my_m_27_girlfriendf_24_is_getting_really_close_to/,My (M 27) Girlfriend(F 24) is getting really close to male co worker(M 25),"For context, my girlfriend and I have been together for just over two years now. She’s F 24, and I’m M 27.
She’s been working with one of her coworkers for over a year, and most of the time they’re in the same office, so they see each other almost every day. Sometimes they even travel to different states together for work, staying for a week or more at a time, so they’re pretty much always together. The guy seems like a decent guy, and I’ve met him a few times. Overall, I trust my girlfriend, but honestly, sometimes she makes it hard to trust her.
A few weeks ago, we had a big argument, and she didn’t tell many people about it. When I asked if she had mentioned it to anyone at work, she said she’d only told one other girl. I had a feeling she’d told him too, but she wouldn’t admit it. After a few days of arguing about it, I finally asked her directly if she’d told him, and she said she had. I kind of already knew that, but hearing it from her still stung—it made me feel sad and betrayed.
The guy has been texting her things like “I’m always here for you” and “Text me anytime.” He’s a nice enough guy, and I don’t think he’s doing anything shady, but they’re constantly messaging each other. It’s not just texts either—they’re on Snapchat, Instagram, even sharing things like cute dog videos (stuff that I send her too). It feels like they talk on every platform imaginable, and sometimes it seems like they talk more than I do with her. Plus, they’re always messaging on their work computers.
What really gets to me is that she says she doesn’t like needy guys—she says I’m “too needy,” but I honestly feel like I’m just anxious and want a normal connection. She definitely has an avoidant attachment style, which makes things a bit harder. I don’t want to be the guy who tells her she can’t have male friends, but at the same time, I feel like there should be some boundaries. They haven’t gone out for drinks or anything (that I know of), but they do meet up for coffee together alone pretty much every day—sometimes even twice a day. They also go on long walks together. I don’t mind them being friends, but it’s starting to feel like she only messages me when it’s convenient for her. Meanwhile, I’m always trying to be available for her, prioritizing her and texting her right away when she does reach out.
It just feels like I’m not a priority. She’s always hanging out with her friends and squeezing me in when it works for her. Meanwhile, I’m the one rearranging my schedule to be available when she has time.
When I’m with her, everything feels great. We’ve been overseas a few times, and we have more trips planned this year. When I’m with her, all the bad stuff seems to disappear, but when she leaves, it’s like I’m forgotten. We have great intimate moments, but she doesn’t really initiate any of it. I sometimes feel like she doesn’t really like me anymore, like I’m just a chore to her, or that she doesn’t find me attractive. It’s hard because this is exactly how I felt in my last relationship—like my ex was constantly nagging me and always wanting more intimacy.
I love her, but I’m struggling to understand what I mean to her anymore. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to feel this way, especially when we’re apart. She’s been a huge part of my life, but I’m starting to wonder if I’m just holding on to something that’s no longer there.
In summary:
* She makes me happy, but only when I’m with her.
* She thinks I’m too clingy and wants more space, but only from me—not from anyone else.
* She doesn’t really initiate intimacy or much affection anymore, and it feels like I’m just there when it’s convenient for her.
* She prioritizes her friends and work over me, and I’m always waiting for her to fit me in.
* I feel like I’m being forgotten when she’s not around, even though we have great times together.
* I love her, but I’m struggling to understand what I mean to her anymore.

I'm in South Carolina. I work for a popular pink and orange themed donut coffee shop. I've been on leave since 6 weeks pregnant for being high risk. I found out yesterday at 9 weeks 4 days that there's no heartbeat and now I'm going to have to go through the process of like forcing my body to miscarry fully. I honestly don't know any other way to explain it. 

I informed my manager of the situation this morning because it means I'll be coming back to work but just not right away because I don't really know what's going to happening next. He informed me that I have until the end of the day to say when I'm coming back or else I'm fired. 

For one I can't do that because South Carolina is basically shut down from the snow we got. So I can't even call my OB to ask anything till Friday at the earliest.  Only reason I know that there's no heartbeat was because I went to the ER to calm my anxiety since I'm high risk.

Is this even legal? To be fired or threatened of firing because I'm unable to provide a date for when I'll be back. It doesn't feel at all right since he knows everything is closed and he even shut down our location because of the weather.

1i7par7,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1i7par7/great_weekend_for_football_food_slots_and_tables/,"Great weekend for football, food, slots, and tables!","Eight of us flew in early Saturday, 4 first timers the rest second timers. Here’s a little trip report for anyone interested.

TLDR: Loved Luxor craps, hated blackjack, bad location, probably won’t stay again. Good food- Amaya, best friend, bazaar meats. Bad food- public house at Luxor. Big slot wins!  
[https://imgur.com/a/dNzAHAn](https://imgur.com/a/dNzAHAn)

Gaming- I primarily play craps and black jack, and on my low bank roll lat trip I stuck with it, but had $1500 to play with and wanted to try some slots as well.

Slots- Day 1, jumped on a $15 craps table but it was cold as ice. Maybe 5 players when I jumped on but 4 quickly left after a PSO. Came my turn to roll, with one other guy, we trade craps numbers and PSO for a quick $200 gone  Jump on a $15 BJ table and again a quick $100 gone, dealer 20 and 21 constantly. Day 2- wake up early and want to play some slots. Jump on Mo Mummy and hit a $150 cash collect to put me down $250 total, few more spins before the wife calls for breakfast so bring her some, but head back because I felt the jackpot was ready to hit after how many blue gems I fed it (yes I know that’s not how it works) so I throw another $50 in and about 10 spins in hit the Jackpot and win a $1k major! What a thrill was literally shaking. other big wins was $200 on Cash Machine at Bellagio, $10 spins  My buddys first time and we jokingly walk into the Park high limit room to see some lower denoms and just say we played there. He sits at Mo Mummy and first spin hits Free Games, gets 18 total, for a quick $100 win. Later head back inside and throw some $4 spins on bank buster and he hits a triple pop for $400! Also turned $100 to $250 on wheel of fortune on the floor.

BJ- dealers at Luxor were garbage. they felt soul less, no interest in interacting, barely saying anything about how much we had, which was frustrating for my buddys first time playing. Thankfully we had a MUCH better experience at Park every time we played there.

Craps- primarily played at Luxor with the exception of the time my wife wanted to finally play, which was at Park with $15 tables, lost another $200 quick and she lost $100. Despite my best efforts to tell her she would have a better time at a $10 back at Luxor the next morning, sometimes you just give in and join for the ride. Here is actually a place Luxor was great. really enjoyed the dealers there this weekend. Had some monster rolls Tuesday morning and was probably up $300. Then there was an issue with someone’s bonus bet, a dealer had a hard time setting someone’s across bet, and I should have pulled my numbers but didn’t. Immediate 7 out, my friend finally showed so I stuck around to teach him but table turned to ice and lost it all.

side missions- UTH and roulette. wanted to give UTH a try after seeing some hands on YouTube. $15 bet, 5 on trips. First hand, 4-5 off, check, flop a 5, check, turn is a 4! Dealer qualifies and a quick win. fuck it that was fun I’ll play again. Same bet, 5 J, check, flop 10 K Q (off suit) max bet, turn don’t remember, RIVER A!! Hugh win! Knew it wasn’t getting better from that so Colored up will def play again. Played the double roulette wheels for something to do. Played 5 numbers at $1 each and would double on a win. Seemed like a good strategy to play for a long time and just rack up some free drinks watching the game. Would love some other strategies since it was just fun to sit and talk for a low roll.

Hotel- Comp stay at Luxor, wanted to compare it to our last stay at Aria. I knew it was a less loved property and further south but wanted a comparison for future trips. LOVED the $10 craps tables in the morning, and pretty consistent $10 BJ During the day. But you can definitely tell it’s an older property. Room was fine, and honestly didn’t think it was that much different from the room in Aria besides the age. Weird thing, our last night the hotel alarm system went off around 2 am and freaked us all out. No real direction on what to do and when we finally decided to leave about 5 min after it started it stopped and said the problem was addressed with no info on what it was. If it wasn’t for the location I would def stay there again, but after gaming up and down the strip again I continued to love the vibe at Park and will probably end up there for our next trip.

Food- lunch At public house first day and wow that was bad. Expensive, horrible service, will not be going back. The coffee shop at the W was good but ended up going to the one between mandalay and lux way more. cheaper and better quick breakfast options. Nothing special but served its purpose. Later sat at the sports bar at Park and had a great time watching the Commanders game. First night dinner at Best Friend. I know it seems to get a lot of hate here but I fucking love it. Great atmosphere, excellent price for how much you get, and bonus it’s in Park.

Next night dinner at Bazzar Meats for the ultimate tasting menu. Wow. This was a phenomenal experience. So many amazing bites and if you can afford it I highly recommend it. top bites were the bison, philly cheese stake bites, liquid olives. Only average dessert which was a bummer. That said I do think it’s a one time for me, until I hit all the other places I want to eat at in the future.

Grabbed some appetizers and drinks at Amaya and was absolutely impressed. Phenomenal guacamole, empanadas, octopus, and mariscos en fuego. Definitely recommend. Other highlights were Din Tai Fung, Aria food hall (those truffle fries are insane, meatball parm was low average).

Shows/experiences- finally did omega mart. Not exactly what I expected going in fairly blind, I sort of wish I did a little more research though. It was fun but also a one and done for me. Absinthe was a blast! Really enjoyed it and would go again but after seeing other shows on my list.

My SO’s birthday is this Friday, and I wanted to be more open with SS and involve him by announcing that I was going to prepare a cake for his dad. He decided that he wanted to make one too, and since then, a weird competition started. I’ll bake my cake tomorrow, but SS already asked his dad if he prefers his cake or mine. SO explained that he likes both, but in different ways. However, that wasn’t enough for SS, and he asked his dad, “But do you love me more than [insert name]?” SO, to reassure him, confirmed it.

It hurt me, but I didn’t say anything. I was feeling down after the day, so I just took my coffee and went to my computer. Soon after, my SO approached me, hugged me, and expressed his love. But damn… I started crying later because I’m just overwhelmed by the HCBM who poisons SS against me. I was done with the day. To not bother anyone, I went for a walk to calm down and only texted my SO, saying that instead of reassuring SS, he just fueled the competition as if it were about first or second place. He could’ve simply explained that love isn’t a competition.

However, my SO said that my reaction was ridiculous and that I should stop competing with a 4-year-old. Later, when I got back, he said it was childish. Boy… I cried alone and went for the walk to avoid bothering anyone. I do everything I can to show SS that he’s a part of this house every day. I’ve been dealing with this drama for a year, and I’m only human. I can feel things, but the mature thing to do is process it myself. He’s absolutely sure that every adult would just easily swallow that kind of reassurance, but I told him that he has no idea what it’s like to be a stepparent and an outsider all the time, and that he will never experience the situation from my perspective.

I am 39, a working professional who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on it, as most of us do, due to wonderful communities and subs. I am married and father to a wonderful daughter whom I love to the moon and back.

So, what am I seeking here? That's a good question, and to be honest, I am just trying to explore and discover myself. Yes, at this age, I am. I have been working rigorously for the last 15 years nonstop and have given my all to my family and running finances, but in the last couple of years it has been a landslide spiral down in my personal space, so I decided that I should pay a bit of attention to discovering outside my monotonous life.

Please do not judge me. I love my family to the core, but this whole thing is about me, and I don't want to give an explanation about it to anyone else; perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view.

I am a shy and introverted personality with a minimum social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say. I give off nerd vibes - so love technology and gadgets, and I watch a lot of sci-fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am.

I love coffee and chocolates, I can be bribed over them.

I am open to chatting about anything, yes, anything (SFW/NSFW/mix), and if we hit it off, I don't mind it being a long-term connection. Oh! I just love the thrill of waiting for a message - the anticipation!!!

You can be anywhere in the world! Just have an open mind! If you like what I wrote drop a Reddit message with a few lines about yourself. Also, I am not looking for any affair or relationship. Just harmless fun!

Soul Meets Body
Soul Meets Body is a thicc bitch punk rock band that truly hails from the DMV;  front-person Genevieve Moore (Baltimore, MD), drummer Brandon Breazeale (Washington, DC) and Guitarist Nate Scholz (Charlottesville, VA) have been making music together since 2017 as Soul Meets Body, though the current lineup emerged in the summer of 2022. The band has released a steady stream of self produced singles in the past two years covering topics of mental health, late-late stage capitalism, and coming to terms with your identity. Blogger Girl the Rock Shows described 2023 single “Forfeit” as “perfect pop-punk, with a twist,” which sums up the band’s wide musical diversity while still falling under the pop-punk and emo umbrella. Lead singer Moore identifies as queer and the band aims to help lift up the music community around those whose voices have often been left out, like LGBTQ+, black and other minorities, and women’s voices. SMB wants YOU to be a part of our community, and strives to make all feel safe and welcomed at their shows. Their debut full length album will be released in 2025.

Becoming
Alternative rock band from Richmond, Virginia, formerly known as Braids. Started off as a duo project, but ever evolving including various artists and musicians from RVA, DC, and beyond.

Gigi Marie 
DC based Pop Punk⭐️🖤
Warning: this artist may cause excessive happiness, spontaneous dance parties, and irreversible feelings of nostalgia.

Gigi Marie is a sonic sorceress weaving together indie pop magic with a dash of '80s flair and a whole lot of heart. With lyrics that explore the messy, beautiful chaos of love, life, and everything in between, her music is a symphony of feels that'll leave you breathless and begging for more.

When she's not conjuring up catchy hooks and melodies in her mystical studio, Gigi can be found sipping coffee, daydreaming about fictional worlds, or secretly rewatching black & white rom-coms (“It Happened One Night” for the 13th time, anyone???). Her music is a testament to the power of imperfection, creativity, and a healthy dose of quirky charm.

So if you're ready to join forces with a kindred spirit who's all about spreading love, joy, and good vibes through her music, then strap yourself in and get ready to embark on this wild ride with Gigi!

Gigi Marie 
DC based Pop Punk⭐️🖤
Warning: this artist may cause excessive happiness, spontaneous dance parties, and irreversible feelings of nostalgia.

Gigi Marie is a sonic sorceress weaving together indie pop magic with a dash of '80s flair and a whole lot of heart. With lyrics that explore the messy, beautiful chaos of love, life, and everything in between, her music is a symphony of feels that'll leave you breathless and begging for more.

When she's not conjuring up catchy hooks and melodies in her mystical studio, Gigi can be found sipping coffee, daydreaming about fictional worlds, or secretly rewatching black & white rom-coms (“It Happened One Night” for the 13th time, anyone???). Her music is a testament to the power of imperfection, creativity, and a healthy dose of quirky charm.

So if you're ready to join forces with a kindred spirit who's all about spreading love, joy, and good vibes through her music, then strap yourself in and get ready to embark on this wild ride with Gigi!

To preface; C (21m) is on the spectrum and has the mentality of around a 7th grader. His dad has passed away and his mom is not a good one, not by any means, so he lives with my husband’s grandparents. I am in NO MEANS making fun of him. The funny part is that GIL(86f) doesn’t know it’s a story. I had totally forgotten about this exchange until my husband reminded me of it. 

My (34f) and my husband (35m) arrange all of our family get togethers and they are always at his grandparents house as they have a very large amount of property and there is a LOT of family that come to them. We actually got married on their property last summer. It’s my favorite spot in the whole world. 

This story takes place the morning of the Memorial Day get together. Grandma-in-law and I are having some coffee and donuts in the kitchen and preparing to decorate and start prepping some of the food. Husband’s cousin strolls in from sucking down a cigarette outside and plops down at the kitchen table with us. 

I’m unsure of how GIL and I came to the topic of gangs/gang violence but that prompted her to have C tell me his story of being recruited to a gang in high school. (I went to that high school, there is 0 gang activity.) 

C begins to weave this totally NOT true AT ALL story that will live rent free forever in my head. Apparently his 2nd week at this school after switching from a smaller school he walked in to the bathroom and saw guys “throwing up gang signs for real for real”. So C introduced himself to the dudes and they decided they wanted him to join their GD Folk gang upon meeting together once in a bathroom for 2 minutes. So they ALL had some fun and just mainly played video games together. 

About 2 months later C made the decision to leave the gang. They were happy for him and told him to keep them in mind in case he ever wants to come back.

Let’s dive into **Rule #5** of the [ECCO Protocol](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECCOAgentFun/comments/1hl33gp/welcome_agents_and_recruits_of_the_earth/), a rule that separates the rookies from the seasoned coincidence connoisseurs:

# RULE #5: DON'T LOSE YOUR SHIT, STAY AWARE

*""You must be able to maintain conscious/thinking/reasoning no matter what events we arrange to happen to you. Some of these events will seem cataclysmic/catastrophic/overwhelming: remember stay aware, no matter what happens/apparently happens to you.""*

Translation? **ECCO is going to mess with you**, probably a lot, and your job is to stay calm, think clearly, and—ideally—laugh through the chaos. Let’s break this down, because this rule isn’t just about surviving; it’s about thriving when the cosmic game board flips upside down. or you get an existential curveball.

# What Does Rule #5 Mean in Practice?

**1. The Universe Is a Trickster:**  
Sometimes, ECCO arranges events that feel like a cosmic pie to the face:

* You lose your keys 30 seconds before an important meeting.
* Your internet dies the *exact* moment you’re about to submit something crucial.
* Or, on a grander scale, life throws you into a storm that feels downright apocalyptic.

**It’s not personal**—it’s just ECCO keeping you on your toes. Your job is to maintain awareness and reason, even when things feel like an episode of *The Twilight Zone.*

# Why Does ECCO Do This?

Good question, Agent. Why does ECCO toss cataclysmic curveballs your way? Here are the likely reasons:

1. **To Test Your Adaptability:** ECCO wants to see if you can roll with the punches. Life’s challenges are opportunities to grow, learn, and flex those cosmic resilience muscles.
2. **To Grab Your Attention:** Sometimes, it takes a little chaos for you to notice what really matters—or what you’ve been ignoring. (Pro Tip: If you’re facing repeated challenges, ask yourself, *“What is ECCO trying to highlight here?”*)
3. **To Amuse Itself:** Let’s be honest—ECCO enjoys a good cosmic joke. Watching you navigate the chaos with grace (or, let’s be real, a little flailing) is part of the fun.

# How to Stay Aware No Matter What Happens

1. **Breathe, Agent. Seriously, Breathe.** When life starts feeling overwhelming, pause and take a deep breath. (Or three.) Oxygen is your friend, and it’s much harder to reason clearly when you’re hyperventilating about how your coffee just spilled onto your last clean shirt.
2. **Ask the Right Questions:** When chaos strikes, shift your focus from *“Why me?!”* to *“What can I learn from this?”* or *“What is ECCO trying to show me here?”* This simple reframing turns catastrophes into puzzles—and puzzles are way more fun to solve.
3. **Practice Cosmic Humor:** Remember, ECCO loves irony. If something ridiculous happens (like the power going out during your synchronicity journal session), laugh. The universe is clearly in on the joke, so you might as well enjoy it.
4. **Anchor in the Present:** When things feel catastrophic, bring yourself back to the moment. Use grounding techniques like:
   * Listing five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can touch, two things you can smell, and one thing you’re grateful for.
   * Or just repeat, *“I am here, and I am not my chaos.”*
5. **Keep Perspective:** Most “cataclysms” look smaller in hindsight. That meeting you were late for? Turns out they delayed it anyway. That time you missed a flight? You avoided turbulence (or a screaming baby in the next row). Trust that there’s a bigger picture you can’t yet see.

# Examples of Cataclysms and ECCO Responses

* **Scenario 1: Your Car Won’t Start on the Way to a Job Interview** *Your Inner Dialogue:* “Why is this happening?! I’m doomed!” *ECCO Perspective:* “You’re meant to meet someone on the bus instead, and they’ll lead you to a better opportunity. Stay aware.”
* **Scenario 2: You Get Stuck in Traffic and Miss an Important Event** *Your Inner Dialogue:* “This is a disaster!” *ECCO Perspective:* “That delay saved you from an even bigger inconvenience—or put you in the exact right place to spot a synchronicity later. Stay patient.”
* **Scenario 3: Your Computer Crashes Right Before a Deadline** *Your Inner Dialogue:* “The universe hates me.” *ECCO Perspective:* “Maybe you needed a break, or perhaps the extra time will help you refine your work. Relax, Agent.”

# Vortex-13’s Top Tips for Navigating the Chaos

1. **Trust the Process:** Even when life feels catastrophic, assume there’s a reason—or at least a lesson—in the chaos. ECCO doesn’t waste energy arranging meaningless coincidences.
2. **Document the Madness:** When weird or overwhelming events occur, write them down. Often, the meaning becomes clearer over time. Plus, you’ll have hilarious stories for the subreddit.
3. **Embrace the Unexpected:** Synchronicities often hide in the chaos. That detour or delay might be leading you to a moment of profound connection or insight.
4. **Laugh. Always Laugh:** Cataclysm or not, humor keeps you grounded. ECCO loves Agents who can laugh at life’s absurdity, even when the cosmic kitchen sink is being thrown at them.

# Final Thoughts

Rule #5 is ECCO’s way of saying, *“Don’t freak out when the universe flips the script.”* Whether the chaos is minor (spilling coffee) or major (existential curveballs), your mission is to stay aware, think clearly, and trust that there’s meaning—or at least a cosmic chuckle—hidden in the madness.

So, dear Agents, the next time life feels catastrophic, take a breath, crack a smile, and remember: **it’s all part of the plan**. ECCO’s got you. (Mostly.)

Stay synchronized, stay resilient, and stay laughing,  
**Vortex-13**

Here is my Cycle of Healing Spread that I did in order to see where I am and what needs healed. I have outlined the spread and I'm not sure I understand how to interpret a couple of them. Feel free to let me know what you think.

1: Current Self: (Where are you now?) The Tower - Something in my life needs to come down. I’m not living in alignment with my true self. I need to see this and choose to let it come down or allow it.

2: Hurt: (What parts of you are in pain?) Two of Wands - Not sure how to read this. Maybe my Spirit/Essential self/Drive is in pain

3: Heal: (What parts of you are ready to heal?) King of Cups - I need to acknowledge deep feelings. Rather than avoiding emotions I can manage my feelings without repressing them. I need to balance the needs of myself along with the community.

4: Path: (How do I move forward?) Queen of Cups - Let love be my driving force, cultivate my intuition and listen to my intuition. Use my inner emotions to connect to my outer reality.

5: Obstacle: (What blocks my path?) King of Pentacles - Does this mean that material things block my path or that I have an obsession with it? Not sure how to interpret.Pulled a clarifier on how to release, avoid or work with the obstacle and it was the Four of Cups. So I see that as waking up and smelling the coffee. Seeing that gifts are there for the offering for me to help me - friendships, guidance, help even.

6: Goal: (Where you need to go, what you need to do or be) - Two of Swords. I think this means I need to make a decision. The only way out of this is to pick a sword. The problem isn’t going to go away just because I ignore it or procrastinate. Remove my blindfold and face the situation as objectively as I can and make a decision. A choice is available, just decide. (The 1 and 6 are the same person just different points of the cycle. I find it very interesting that the goal, what I need to do or be points back to me/is reminiscent of something that needs to happen from current self.)

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I work for a popular pink and orange themed donut coffee shop. I've been on leave since 6 weeks pregnant for being high risk. I found out yesterday at 9 weeks 4 days that there's no heartbeat and now I'm going to have to go through the process of like forcing my body to miscarry fully. I honestly don't know any other way to explain it. 

I informed my manager of the situation this morning because it means I'll be coming back to work but just not right away because I don't really know what's going to happening next. He informed me that I have until the end of the day to say when I'm coming back or else I'm fired. 

For one I can't do that because South Carolina is basically shut down from the snow we got. So I can't even call my OB to ask anything till Friday at the earliest.  Only reason I know that there's no heartbeat was because I went to the ER to calm my anxiety since I'm high risk.

Is this even legal? To be fired or threatened of firing because I'm unable to provide a date for when I'll be back. It doesn't feel at all right since he knows everything is closed and he even shut down our location because of the weather.

These days, though, it's starting to make me crazy.  
  
Whenever he shakes anything.  ANYTHING, he shakes it exactly fifteen times.  Always.  And always in the same rhythmic pattern.  
  
It's 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8, short pause, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7  
  
He gets up before I do, so he's in charge of making the morning's coffee.  When he rinses out the pot, it's three rinses, each time holding his hand over the lid and shaking it exactly fifteen times.  
  
If we're having a salad with dinner, he'll pick up the Italian dressing and shake it- exactly fifteen times.  Same thing when mixing up some instant iced tea or koolaid.    
  
At the gas pump, squeegying the windshield.  Dip, drip, squeege, then shake, exactly fifteen times.  
  
Spray paint?  That clicky ball in the can is gonna hit the top and the bottom exactly fifteen times.  Multiple sets, until it's well mixed.  
  
For the record, he does not have OCD.  He's been tested.  He has no similar compulsion to do anything else for a fixed number of repetitions.  This is the only thing he does like this.  
  
Every damn day, at least once (for the coffee) and usually again for some random thing.  I can literally count to fifteen by eight then seven in my effing head!  It was OK before we both got to work remote, but now I'm dreading every time I hear him get up.  Will he find something to shake?  When will the count start?

My ex bf and I broke up 5 months ago after being together for 6 months. We had a pretty mutual split as there were things for both of us that just weren’t working. It wasn’t due to a loss of love; we just didn’t have great communication. I was willing to try and fix things but he was more stubborn and said we had our answer in front of us. 

  After not speaking for a few months with the exception of one check in where he asked how I was doing, he texted me one day: “Totally fine if you don’t want to but was gonna ask if you wanted to get coffee or something when I’m back / maybe in the new year if December is too busy. If I’m being totally honest I really don’t like not having you in my life hah 😅.” 

  This brought back a lot of emotion for me and made me realize I definitely was not fully over him. I decided to meet up with him for drinks and we had a nice time but never brought up the past relationship or intentions. We just caught up and it was lighthearted. It made me realize how much I missed him and truly valued my time with him. 

  A few weeks after this I decided to just reach out directly to see where his head was at. I said: “Really glad we got to catch up the other night. To be honest, I had been really missing having you in my life, and when you texted me last month, I wasn’t sure where your head was at. Just want to make sure we’re on the same page. Totally cool if you’d want to talk about it in person.” 

He responded to me: 
“Yeah I was really missing you too. I wanted to reach out earlier but also wanted to give you/us space. I’d really like to explore a friendship with you if possible but totally understand if that’s not possible for us rn. And yeah happy to talk about it more in person too at any point.” 

Now I’m feeling confused on his intentions/feelings. His initial text sounded emotionally charged and like he still had feelings, but after I directly asked him he just wants to explore a friendship? The wording is very vague. I honestly would love to get back with him but also understand that may not be possible. I think hearing from him when he invited me to get drinks really set me back in my healing. Any advice appreciated!!

1i7om89,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i7om89,Impulse Buy Dripper,"I had no need for this, but it was only a few bucks and seemed interesting enough to try. 

- Silicone, so collapsible, good thermal characteristics, “better” as plastic concerns go (not my issue, but some may be interested.)
- very B75-like, with the wave ridges and supported/open bottom.
- have only used it a few times, but it seems to hold the pleats more evenly compared to Stagg X, so less grounds trapped in the pleats. 

I’m not going to insult readers by claiming it has magical brew qualities that instantly “bring out all the notes” or similar nonsense. That’s on the person brewing, not the dripper, save for rare exceptions of flawed design. 

It does correctly do the job of holding a filter full of ground coffee and water, better than many, with no restriction to flow, and no apparent chance of filter choking. I’ve seen it on Amazon under the Vandroop brand, and on Ali in the Leeseph store and several others.

It wasn’t—     
it was my choice.     
      
I made the choice like the fox in the trap,     
gnawing through my own tendons to free myself.

hot and unrelenting,    
a wild horse you can’t outpace.

stirring its coffee,     
smiling at how little I could eat.

it roared like an engine without brakes,    
driving me past every soft shoulder,     
every exit ramp,     
to the cliff.

I chose it with the clarity of a scalpel,    
with the cruelty of an empty garden    
planted knowing nothing would grow.

Last week, I asked for your favorite local coffee roasters, and the responses were amazing—it got me thinking about how we can better support our local coffee scene and ensure as many folks as possible are getting their coffee locally.

I’m working on an idea for a local coffee subscription that delivers freshly roasted beans from Pioneer Valley roasters right to your door. To kick it off, I’m planning to hand-deliver the first 100 orders by bike—a fun, eco-friendly way to launch the project! 🚲

But I want to make sure this idea resonates with our community before moving forward. If you have 3 minutes, I’d love your help with a quick survey:

https://forms.gle/nf93LMiPg4ZtSaCC6

	•	Where you currently get your coffee
	•	What you’d want in a coffee subscription
	•	Whether this idea would excite you
