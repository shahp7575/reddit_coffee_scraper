# A No-Filter Reality Check & Complete 7-Phase Transformation Blueprint 

You’re the **owner & driver** of your life’s high-performance machine—your **mind-body-spirit**. Right now, Big Tobacco and a profit-driven system have you trapped in **slave mode**, slowly corroding your engine. This guide is your **weapon** to:

1. **Crush** the old “smoker slave” programming
2. **Upgrade** every mental, emotional, physical, energetic & spiritual component
3. **Launch** yourself as a **master driver** in a Ferrari-level supercar of human potential

Once you complete these 7 phases, the “addicted you” is **deleted**, and the authoritative, unstoppable “Master You” emerges.

# 🔥 WHY YOU’RE STILL A SLAVE (AND WHO’S PROFITING)

* Big Tobacco and **government** tax revenue rely on your habit. They push “smoke breaks,” medical fees, sickness, and second-hand liability, keeping you **sick, broke, and dependent**.
* **They profit** while you cough, waste money, lose time, and shorten your lifespan.
* You’ve been **programmed** by ads, peer pressure, stress myths, and nicotine’s chemical leash.

**Hard Truth**: If you don’t break this programming, you remain a **puppet**, fueling an industry that doesn’t care when you die, as long as you keep buying.

# 🛠 SYSTEM OVERVIEW: 7 PHASES TO TOTAL FREEDOM

1. **MENTAL REPROGRAMMING** – Delete the “smoker.exe” slave code; install “MasterDriver” OS.
2. **EMOTIONAL SHOCK & POWER SHIFT** – Make addiction feel like a prison; quitting feel like peak thrill.
3. **PHYSICAL DETOX & PERFORMANCE UPGRADE** – Flush nicotine sludge; rebuild your body as a supercar.
4. **ENERGETIC & SPIRITUAL AWAKENING** – Reconnect to your highest purpose; ignite your soul.
5. **SOCIAL & ENVIRONMENTAL DOMINATION** – Build a champion’s pit crew; demolish all triggers.
6. **PERMANENT IDENTITY LOCK-IN** – Cement the MasterDriver identity; make relapse impossible.
7. **STUPID VS. WISE DECISIONS** – SHORT-TERM TRAPS VS. LONG-TERM GAINS

Each phase uses **5–10 analogies** (master vs. slave, strong vs. weak, prison vs. freedom, old car vs. supercar) plus **family & friends contrasts** to **crash** the old program and **install** new, empowering habits.

# 1️⃣ MENTAL REPROGRAMMING

**Goal**: **Delete** addiction beliefs; **install** the MasterDriver OS—where smoking simply doesn’t compute.

# 🔥 8 Master vs. Slave Analogies

1. **King vs. Serf** – A master rules his domain; a slave shivers under commands.
2. **Commander vs. Puppet** – You command your actions; a puppet is tugged by strings of nicotine.
3. **Alpha vs. Beta** – An alpha decides its fate; a beta bows to cravings.
4. **Captain vs. Castaway** – A captain steers a ship; a castaway drifts helplessly.
5. **CEO vs. Employee** – You lead strategy; a slave follows payroll—your payroll is Big Tobacco.
6. **Pilot vs. Co-pilot** – As pilot, you choose the runway; as co-pilot controlled by nicotine, you crash into addiction.
7. **Master Key vs. Locked Cell** – New beliefs unlock freedom; old beliefs lock you in shame.
8. **Software Update vs. Malware** – Smoking is malware slowing your system; reprogramming is the high-speed update.

# 🛠 Key Steps

* **Hard-Truth Audit**: List every “benefit” you think cigarettes give you. Next to each, write the brutal truth (e.g., “relaxes me” → “actually spikes anxiety when withdrawal hits”).
* **NLP Reframe & Anchor**: Choose a gesture (e.g., squeeze fist). When craving hits, perform it and say, “I am free. I control my system.” Repeat until the gesture **shuts down** cravings.
* **Daily Ritual**: Write old beliefs on paper. Burn or shred them—**symbolic deletion**. Then recite: > “I run MasterDriver v1.0.Smoking.exe is uninstalled.”

# 2️⃣ EMOTIONAL SHOCK & POWER SHIFT

**Goal**: Make continuing to smoke feel like life in a maximum-security prison; quitting like strapping into a rocket.

# 🔥 5 Extreme Analogies

1. **Quicksand vs. Jetpack** – Smoking drags you under; quitting rockets you upward.
2. **Rusty Cage vs. Open Cockpit** – Addiction locks you in metal bars; freedom opens you to infinite skies.
3. **Dead Weight vs. Superhero Cape** – Smoking burdens you; quitting gives you wings.
4. **Dim Cell vs. Grand Arena** – Smoker you cowers in darkness; quitter you stands in spotlight, applauded.
5. **Bleak Drought vs. Pouring Fountain** – Addiction dries your joy; freedom floods you with exhilaration.

In their place, each deliberate choice for freedom is an instiller of **strength**, **mastery**, and **unstoppable momentum**.

📆 **Rewire Daily:** Read these contrasts each morning. Let their electric jolt **reformat your deepest circuits**, erasing the “slave you” and booting up the **Master You**—elevated, empowered, unbreakable.

But now a significant number of my *favorite scents of all time* are ones I got in that order. It turns out, the Alkemias I hate, I really hate, but the ones I love, I reallllyyyy love. High risk high reward. And I feel like taking that gamble again.  
But, in the interests of improving my odds, I would like a little bit of help...so I'm soliciting your reviews!

For context, I like masculine scents, and based on the Alkemia scents that have agreed with me, I'm interested in trying the following scent profiles/notes from them: coffee, leather, unique incenses, Alkemia's most niche/weird scents, dark gourmands & ambers. Also possibly tea, rain and some aquatics though I don't have the highest hopes for these latter.  
I'm wanting to avoid: unlisted white amber notes!!!, smoke and dirt notes, light/fresh florals, and the Alkemia soapy curse, which seem to be the factors responsible for most of my unsuccessful samplings from them.

If you've tried any of the following, please let me know what they smelled like to you -

Book of Shadows

Sailing to Byzantium

Viridis Arcanum

Single Note: Cuir

Dustsceawung (I have a feeling I'm going to hate this one, but I'm intrigued)

1kz2nxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BumpersWhoBolus/comments/1kz2nxy/is_my_high_risk_diabetes_in_pregnancy_doctor_a/,Is my high risk diabetes in pregnancy doctor a complete quack?,"This is gonna be a bit long so please stick around, I desperately need other opinions. I (25F) have had type 1 diabetes since I was barely 9 years old and have been managing by myself since I was about 14 after my mom passed away. I have never had good experiences with endocrinologists, but I am now 25 weeks pregnant with my first baby and am seeing a “high risk” doctors office.

Now, despite my past of not being a perfect diabetic, I consider myself pretty damn knowledgeable about the disease as it’s been at the front of my mind for the past 16 years. Since being pregnant, my glucose levels look better than they ever have in my life due to myself being extremely vigilant, counting every carbohydrate, checking glucose 10+ times a day etc. My levels are in range 75% of the time.

I had an appointment with this doctor yesterday, we’ll call him Dr S, and despite my glucose levels being good for the most part, he changed ALL OF MY MEDICATIONS. And not just a little, but a lot.

I drink coffee every morning (with OB approval.) as I’m sure some of you know, coffee spikes sugar very fast. I have been pre-bolusing 20 mins in advance for my coffee and am still seeing spikes. This is the ONLY thing consistently wrong with my levels that needed fixed, which could have been solved by bolusing sooner and perhaps a slightly higher dose. Nothing else in my day to day needed changing, and my blood sugar log showed him that very clearly. Regardless of this, he decided to up my Lantus by 5 units (I take it in the morning.) from 31 units to 36 for no reason?? He also changed my insulin to carb ratio from 1:8 to 1:6 for the whole day. I also take an NPH insulin at night to help with my fasting glucose levels in the morning. The highest number I had for fasting was 184 and that was one day out of a week. Because of this one outlier, he changed my dosage from 8 units to 14 of the NPH. The first night of me taking this I was sent low twice in an 8 hour period.

Another issue - in a weeks worth of logged glucose levels, I have ONE low sugar of 64. Dr S points to this number and tells me he wants me to stop pre-bolusing for my food and start taking my insulin during my last bite so I have a more precise calculation of carbs…..huh????? This goes against everything I’ve ever been taught in my life, and to change something like this because of one low level, just doesn’t sound like a good idea.

I came to Reddit because I’m concerned. I don’t want to follow a single one of these medication changes. It all seems too drastic and somewhat unnecessary. I also try to keep the opinion that I am not a doctor. But my gut is screaming at me not to jump straight into these new dosages. I am scared of dangerous lows, which can also become very expensive and problematic when I don’t have a pantry fully stocked with juices and puddings and snacks while at work 8 hours of the day.

I want to do what’s right for my baby, and that usually means following doctor’s orders. But what do you do when doctor’s orders scare and concern you as much as these concern me?

To make it easier for you. Here are some ways","To catch them redhanded do these steps everyday. 

# Location Tracking

1. **Google Maps Timeline**
   * Beyond basic location history, export her Timeline data (via Google Takeout if you have her account access) for a detailed spreadsheet of movements over months. Map these against her schedule—unexplained detours to residential areas, late-night stops, or recurring visits to a specific spot could signal something. Check ""Trip Details"" for transit methods (e.g., was she driven?).
2. **Significant Locations (iPhone)**
   * Dig into Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services > Significant Locations. Enable it if it’s off (requires her passcode), then review timestamps and addresses. Cross-check with her calendar or verbal alibis—frequent “errands” at an odd address might not add up.
3. **Find My Phone or Friends**
   * If she uses Find My (iPhone) or Google’s Find My Device (Android), log into her iCloud or Google account from another device. See her real-time location or last known spot. If she shares her location with you, monitor for inconsistencies (e.g., “at the gym” but pinging elsewhere).
4. **Wi-Fi Connection History**
   * On Android, go to Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi > Saved Networks to see every network she’s joined. On iOS, it’s trickier (no direct list), but if she’s on your Wi-Fi, check the router’s logs for her device’s MAC address and connection times elsewhere. Look for unfamiliar networks like “John’s Wi-Fi.”
5. **Fitness Tracker Sync**
   * If she syncs a Fitbit, Apple Watch, or similar to her phone, open the app (e.g., Fitbit app, Health on iOS). Check step counts, sleep patterns, or GPS-tracked workouts. Sudden activity spikes at odd hours or locations could hint at unreported outings.

# Communication Apps

1. **Text Messages (Deep Dive)**
   * Beyond basic texts, use the search function (magnifying glass in Messages on iOS/Android) to find keywords like “love,” “meet,” or a name she avoids mentioning. Check group chats for flirty side comments. Restore deleted texts via iCloud backup (Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Restore from iCloud) if you can access it.
2. **Call Logs and Voicemail**
   * Review call duration and frequency in the Phone app. Call unknown numbers from a blocked line to hear who answers (e.g., a man’s voice). Check voicemail (dial her carrier’s VM number if needed) for saved messages she forgot to delete—some carriers keep them indefinitely.
3. **Email (Hidden Accounts)**
   * Open her email app and check all folders (Inbox, Sent, Trash, Spam) for flirty exchanges or confirmations (e.g., hotel bookings). Search for dating site notifications (e.g., “Tinder match”). If she uses Gmail, go to [myaccount.google.com](http://myaccount.google.com/) \> Security > Third-party apps with account access for linked apps she’s hidden.
4. **Encrypted Messaging Apps**
   * Open WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. Check “Starred Messages” or “Pinned Chats” for prioritized conversations. Look for self-destructing messages (Signal’s Disappearing Messages setting) or locked chats (WhatsApp’s Chat Lock). Export chat backups (WhatsApp > Settings > Chats > Chat Backup) if synced to Google Drive/iCloud.
5. **Voice Assistants**
   * Ask Siri (iOS) or Google Assistant (Android) about recent queries: “What did I ask yesterday?” or check voice history (Google app > More > Activity). Look for searches like “delete call history” or “hotels nearby.” On Android, go to [myactivity.google.com](http://myactivity.google.com/) for a full log.
6. **Screen Time/Digital Wellbeing (Full Audit)**
   * Break down app usage by day/hour. A sudden jump in Snapchat at 2 a.m. or a dating app she claims she doesn’t use is a red flag. On iOS, check Downtime or App Limits for apps she’s restricted—why hide them? On Android, look at app permissions (Settings > Apps > Permissions) for suspicious access (e.g., camera use).
7. **Hidden or Vault Apps**
   * Search for apps like Calculator+, Private Photo Vault, or Keepsafe. Test calculator apps—some require a secret code (e.g., “1234+”) to unlock hidden content. Check Settings > General > iPhone Storage (iOS) or Settings > Apps (Android) for unfamiliar names with high data usage.
8. **Dating App Remnants**
   * Even if deleted, search her email for signup confirmations or payment receipts (e.g., Tinder Premium). On iOS, check Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > Allowed Apps for blocked apps. On Android, look in Google Play > Subscriptions.
9. **Two-Factor Authentication Clues**
   * Open Settings > Passwords (iOS) or Google Password Manager (Android) to see saved logins. Look for unrecognized accounts (e.g., a second Instagram). Check her text messages for 2FA codes from apps she doesn’t admit to using.
10. **App Notifications (Silent Mode)**

* Go to Settings > Notifications. See which apps have alerts disabled—silenced dating apps or messengers suggest hiding. Watch her phone when it’s idle; a locked screen with no buzz might mean selective muting.

# Media and Files

1. **Photo/Video Gallery (Hidden Folders)**
   * Open Photos (iOS) or Gallery (Android). Check “Hidden” or “Recently Deleted” albums for suggestive pics or videos. On iOS, use Face ID-protected Hidden Album (Settings > Photos). On Android, look for .nomedia folders via a file explorer app.
2. **Cloud Storage (Full Sweep)**
   * Log into iCloud, Google Drive, or Dropbox. Search for encrypted ZIPs, oddly named files, or private albums. Check shared folders for exchanges with others. Use [iCloud.com](http://icloud.com/) to restore deleted files if she’s sloppy.
3. **Screenshots and Downloads**
   * Check the Screenshots folder for captured chats or maps she forgot to delete. On Android, Downloads (Files app) might hold PDFs or tickets (e.g., movie stubs for two). On iOS, Files > On My iPhone > Downloads is similar.
4. **Camera Roll Metadata**
   * Open a photo, tap “Info” (iOS) or “Details” (Android) to see when and where it was taken. A selfie at an unknown spot with geotags could contradict her story.
5. **Audio Recordings**
   * Check Voice Memos (iOS) or Recorder (Android) for saved calls or notes. Some cheaters record meetups as mementos—listen for background noise or voices.

# Habits and Patterns

1. **Battery Usage Trends**
   * Settings > Battery shows which apps drain power most. A spike in a messaging app after she’s “asleep” suggests late-night use. Compare daily patterns—sudden shifts might align with new connections.
2. **Browser History (Incognito Fails)**
   * Even in Incognito, autofill (type random letters in the address bar) reveals past searches. Look for specific keywords or gift sites. Check bookmarks for secret logins.
3. **Keyboard Predictions**
   * Open Notes and type random words—her keyboard’s learned phrases (Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement on iOS) might suggest frequent terms like a lover’s name or “hide.”
4. **Alarm and Calendar Check**
   * Look at Clock > Alarms for odd wake-ups (e.g., 3 a.m. for a “call”). Open Calendar for coded events—“meeting” at a hotel. Sync with iCloud/Google Calendar for deleted entries.
5. **Bluetooth Pairings**
   * Settings > Bluetooth > Paired Devices lists car stereos or earbuds. “Mike’s AirPods” when she claims no Mike exists is a clue. Check connection history if available.

# Beyond the Phone

1. **Smart Home Devices**
   * If she uses Alexa/Google Home synced to her phone, check the app’s activity log (e.g., Alexa app > More > Activity). Queries like “turn off lights” at odd hours or locations suggest she’s elsewhere.
2. **Banking/Payment Apps**
   * Open Venmo, Cash App, or bank apps (if you know her PIN). Look for payments to unknown people, coffee dates, or hotel charges. Search her email for e-receipts if she’s logged out.
3. **SIM Card Swap Check**
   * Inspect the phone’s SIM tray (needs a pin) for a second SIM or eSIM (Settings > Cellular > Add eSIM on iOS). A dual-SIM setup could mean a secret number. Call her known number while holding the phone—if it doesn’t ring, she’s rerouting.
4. **Social Engineering via Phone**
   * Text an unknown number from her phone (“Hey, it’s me, new number”) and see who replies. Or call a frequent contact pretending to be a wrong number—gauge their familiarity.

1kz2lgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1kz2lgz/grieving_a_dream/,Grieving a dream,"Hey everyone, this is a bit of a different post for me, but I needed to put it out there somewhere, as I’m the only person in my life who knows what I’m going through right now, and feel very alone as I have nobody I can really share this with.

So all the way back in November, I had realized that I had fallen in love with my fp. I know it sounds dumb, and I’m sure lots of people have thought the same thing only to realize it was the BPD kicking in, but as someone who’s had many fps in the past, I realized this was different, and I still love her deeply, even to this very day.

She is so beautiful, and has a sense of humour that is hard to come by. Her interests align so intricately with mine, and not in a masking kind of way, but in a way that I can be my genuine self around her. I’ve dived into so many interesting new rabbit holes because of her. We have moments of closeness, and moments of distance, but I love her through all of it. I want her to be happy. And to thrive. And I want more than ever to have her in my life, as my person, growing along side me.

Here’s the catch. She’s in a relationship. She’s in a relationship that she’s described as not ideal many times over, but I’m sure her opinions on it change by the day. I had always wanted to support her so long as she was happy, and have kept my feelings to myself, and done what I could to help her through the rough patches of her relationship. And yesterday I found out that they are taking the next step and moving in together next month.

This really caught me off guard, I think it caught everyone off guard who knows the two of them. Hell, she was considering breaking up with him for the longest time, all the way up until a few weeks ago. Anyways, when I found out the news yesterday, it had a deep impact on me, and caused me to have a meltdown.

I realized this morning why. I’m grieving. I’m grieving a pipe dream I had and have been carrying in my subconscious for months and months. That one day, she would see me the same way I see her, and decide that she wanted to build a future with me. A dream of waking up and drinking coffee out our fun mugs in bed, going out and buying plants for our little garden, thrift store runs to decorate our room, taking turns driving after going out of town on an adventure. I’m grieving all of that. A little life, made up in my head, fuelled on nothing but hope and the dream that one day she would reciprocate the love I have for her. 

After yesterday, I realized that that dream I had was not going to be my reality, not with her at least. And it sucks, because I desperately want it to be her. I’ve never fallen in love before prior to this, and so this is a grief I really can’t explain. She’s my person, I chose her, and after all we’ve been through, she never chose me back. 

Now, it’s not like she’s no longer a part of my life. She’s still one of my closest friends. I’ll do whatever I can to support her decision, I want her to be happy. I want her to feel loved, even if it’s not me who can love her the way I wish I could. It’s a bittersweet feeling. So I’ll stuff this grief deep down for now, and pretend like nothings wrong outwardly. And maybe, hopefully one day, I’ll find someone who wants to love me the way I want to love her.

Don't know how to properly start this, and I'm not entirely sure what exactly I am looking for at this point. You have probably read a similar situation of someone, somewhere on the internet at some point in time.

I think I will just start with what happened. I was working for this company since October, and everything was basically fine. The pay was good, and I didn't have to deal with anything beside the work itself. Until I got a letter saying the contract would be ended prematurely on May 22nd. The letter arrived on April 22nd, stating the reason as being... unfit to work. I tried to appeal, but it didn't work. Also, they would be holding out on both April and May paychecks. I was devastated. I picked up the job while I was in a lot of debt with the bank, from a student loan and investments with a local coffee shop chain (I worked for them for 5 years). I was both overjoyed for a job paying this well ($1100/month is a lot where I'm from) and hesitant because I had to work graveyard hours for the entirety of the contract. I eventually took the job, and it turned out to be my lifesaver at that time.

And just a couple of days before May 22nd, my girlfriend broke up with me. This left me further questioning my competency. I loved her. I have known her for six years, and we had been together for 2.5 years. Then things got cold, but eventually, we got back together for a year at that point. I couldn't bring myself to question or to hate her, not at all. Now that the job is gone, the immense pressure of the $5K+ debt is rushing behind my back every month, and I have a bank account of $44 left. There is no one to share my feelings with or just how stupidly hard things have been. I don't know what to do. Things I have tried so far include renewing my resume, applying here and there to all the positions that I might qualify for, and looking for projects or part-time work that I used to do. But the job marketplace is truly grim here.

I have never been this desperate, for a job or basically for anything. I failed the driver's license exam yesterday too, a stupid mistake on my end. I got 3/4 exams, so just one step away from getting it. I was really hoping that I could pass to potentially be a driver just to make it through. I spent days practicing for that exam only to fail it because of a stupid mistake. I can't even pay the $50 that was asked by the exam provider for the practicing hours. I don't know what to feel or how to deal with the situation. I just feel embarrassed, helpless, and foolish. I have never been here and have never sought something on the internet like this, let that be either an outlet or advice. But thank you, truly, to anyone who has read this post. I wish you well!

TLDR: I'm 25. I expected a lot more from myself at 25 when I was younger. I lost my job, my girlfriend broke up with me, I'm in debt and broke, struggling with fragments of my thoughts – nothing is coming together lately, and I don't know how to make it through or what to feel right now.""",2,1748606932.0,depression,0,1.0,False

1kz2hfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1kz2hfn/to_those_who_keep_looking_for_something_better/,To Those Who Keep Looking for “Something Better”,"Dear You,

Sometimes, we get so caught up in looking for “something better” that we forget to appreciate what we already have. We convince ourselves that there’s always someone out there who’s more exciting, more successful, more aligned with our dreams.

Pero sana, bago ka maghanap sa labas, tanungin mo muna sarili mo: kulang ba talaga, o baka lang hindi na exciting gaya ng dati?

Let me be clear, I’m not saying you should stay in a relationship that’s toxic or abusive. Hindi ito tungkol sa pagtitiis ng sakit. This is about learning to recognize when you have something good, someone kind, respectful, patient, and steady.

I know someone who learned this lesson the hard way. A doctor.
He had a long-time partner—non-doctor, tahimik lang, supportive, full of love. Walang grand gestures, walang drama, but it was real and stable. For a while, that was enough.

Then he met a coworker. Fellow doctor. Mas exciting, mas intense. He thought it was love—something deeper, more “meant to be.” So he left his partner.

Fast forward to now: the spark with the coworker didn’t last. That relationship ended. And the doctor? He realized too late that what he had before wasn’t boring—it was solid. Safe. Beautiful.
But it was already too late. His ex moved on and is happier now. And he lives with the weight of what can’t be undone.

Alam mo, not every good thing will feel like a movie scene. Love isn’t always fireworks. Sometimes, it’s choosing each other on the days when it feels ordinary. It’s making coffee before work, staying during bad days, and holding each other through boredom, not just romance.

So if you’re in a relationship that’s peaceful and real, don’t throw it away chasing something that just seems better. Sometimes, the most genuine kind of love is the quiet one—the one that’s always been there.

Know the difference between something that's truly lacking, and something you’ve just stopped appreciating.

Minsan, okay na ‘yung okay. And in the right relationship, “okay” can grow into something extraordinary—if you let it.

The rosemary potatoes were okay but there was pretty much no rosemary to be found (it was clearly dried not fresh)

Ashley and her best friend were inside the coffee shop owned by her sister. They were supposed to be discussing some of the shots they took before showing them to their clients. Free novel ready to read! Comment now and I’ll send you the complete link.,"# Chapter 1

Ashley and her best friend were inside the coffee shop owned by her sister. They were supposed to be discussing some of the shots they took before showing them to their clients. Both of them came from a well-off family but they wanted to open their own business. They took a photography course. Kat studied in Mumbai while she went to a university in Arkansas. They recently opened their start-up business, a studio which they named a AshKat. Kat was more of the commercial photographer, she on the other hand was the food and event photographer but they could do each other’s jobs if they needed to. She could even ask help from Kat’s ex-boyfriend, Clyde who was a more versatile photographer than the two of them.

She sighed heavily before finally putting the camera down. Showing Kat the pictures was useless because her friend seemed to be busy checking out someone.

""Kat! Are you listening to me?!” She asked with a frown.

Her friend started talking as if to herself while her eyes were on the entrance of the café. ""Please let him go here. Please…please. I promise that I will stop criticizing our models and will be nicer to them just let him come inside so I can see him up-close.”

She turned to where her friend’s eyes seem fixated. The café had glass windows. Outside was a tall man who was surrounded by thee women. Behind the man, two males were grinning while checking out the women. She could only see the tall man's right profile. He was in a white shirt and from this far, it was obvious that he had a hunky body and she noticed a tattoo on his arm.

With a raise brow she mumbled, “An actor?”

Usually women go gaga over good-looking actors who most of the timewere full of themselves, just like the one outside.

With another sigh, she shook Kat’s left arm. “Who are you looking at?” she asked in a bit irritated small voice.

Kat turned and her narrowed eyes went to her.""Seriously Ash? You are also a photographer so you should know him! “

She just rolled her eyes. ""Look! I don't have a very sharp eye when it comes to men unlike you!""

She stood up when she noticed that the barista seemed to be searching for something. She might as well just help him since her sister was not in the café.

“Gosh Ashley! You really have no idea? Well he is no other than the Jett Alejandre! The heir of Alejandre Group of Companies. His family is filthy rich but he works as a part-time model. He is the newest male model of IRM which stands for It's Raining Men Apparel. The owner is his uncle. He also does modelling abroad FYI!”

She just stuck out her tongue at her. They maybe friends but they didn’t exactly like the same things. ""Oh okay! Now I recognize that name. So the bad boy and playboy of the runway is outside. Do you want to welcome him with a drink to show your admiration? “She asked sarcastically before turning to leave.

That man might be very good looking, famous and rich but she was not into such males. She walked to the counter.

""What are you looking for?"" she asked Neil, the bartender.

He smiled shyly at her, “The cinnamon powder Miss Ashley. I can’t find it.”

""It’s here."" she opened the small cabinet next to the coffee machine.

The cute barista nervously grinned and apologized.

She smiled back. ""That’s okay. “

Kat’s shrill voice made her turn her head. ""Oh my gosh! This is it!”

She shook her head from side to side. Her friend was giddier! She transferred her eyes to the entrance and saw Mr. Arrogant and God's gift to women was about to come inside the cafe.

""Oh geez Katherine! Will you just stop!” she angrily said before turning her back to go to the kitchen.

After a few moments, when she returned to check on Kat, she saw her holding the camera while looking at some photos with a frown. Cocking one brow, she roamed her eyes and saw the reason for that distorted expression.

Jett Alejandre was sitting at one of the tables with his buddies. A woman in a slinky dress had her hand on one of his biceps with a tattoo. No wonder her friend looked annoyed.

“Eow Kat!! Don't tell me you're jealous?"" She chuckled before sitting across her. She had her back on Jett’s group.

Kat darted her an angry stare but didn't say anything.

""You are prettier and you shouldn't even be bothering with that man! You have Clyde you know.""

Her friend finally straightened and leaned on the seat. She crossed her arms in front of her while her eyes went to Jett.

""Thanks Ash! You are really a nice friend. I know that you are just making me feel better. I am so plain so I guess I better stop this nonsense. He is way out of my league.” She said sadly.

""You are too hard on yourself! You are pretty and nice that’s why Clyde still loves you. It was you who broke up with him. He wants you back but the problem is you. That Jett Alejandre is bad news. If you don’t want to have stress and a heartache avoid such players!"" She advised then took the camera Kat was looking at. She almost dropped it on the table when the latter slapped her arm so she glared at her.

""Why am I so stupid? I am too confident that’s why I get in trouble sometimes! I am not a good match for Jett, you are! You are gorgeous and you two are perfect for each other! You are a sexy single female who is ready to mingle!” she said giddily.

She groaned in frustration. “No way! He’s not my type and I don’t want any stress in my life! I am happy being single. Stop wasting time and just check these photos I chose for our new client."" she changed the subject by showing her friend the camera.

Kat sighed heavily."" I don’t know why you chose to be a photographer when you can be a model. If I were you...”

She cut her friend off by showing her the pictures. “This one is good…”

(At Jett's table)

""I really have to go. Call me okay?"" the woman said to Jett before giving him a peck on the cheek . She even waved at Andy and Seth before leaving.

""Way to go dude! Jett Alejandre did it again! Getting a woman is effortless!” Seth said with a chuckle before he and Andy gave each other a high five.

Jett just grinned. His friends were right. Women flock to him all the time which could be tiring and boring.

“Look who’s here. We were about to split dude!” Seth told Dale who just got inside.

They all fist- bumped.

""Sorry dudes! I had to bring my car to the shop. Something’s wrong with the lights.”

Andy and Seth let out disapproving sounds from the back of their throats while Jett just shook his head.

“Better get a new one dude! Last time it was the engine. You are just pouring money down the drain! Anyway time to go! Gil is waiting for us. I am really interested in the monster bike he has been talking about.” The latter said.

“Give me a sec dude!” Dale advanced into the room.

Jett just nodded while checking his phone.

“Wow dude! Who is that?” whistled Seth under his breath which made Jett frown. \*\*\*

Ashley turned when she heard a male’s voice.

""Miss Gorgeous? It is really you!”

She stood up and smiled at the tall man approaching her. ""Dorky? Is that you?"" She asked with a light laugh.

Dorky didn’t suit the man anymore. He looked good and he dressed well but she knew it was him. Only one guy in her high school called her Miss Gorgeous. And that was Dale “Dorky” Evangelista. He was graduating while she was a freshman when they met.

“I didn’t think it was possible that you will be more gorgeous! Can I give you a bear hug?” He asked. His eyes were pleading and twinkling.

She just nodded with a smile then let him enveloped her in his arms for a friendly embrace.

""Dang man! Dale is so lucky! Where did that sexy woman come from?!” Seth said with envy .

Jett pocketed his phone and turned to see why Seth and Andy were gawking. His eyes narrowed. Dale just released a petite, very pretty and sexy as hell female.

""Your flattery will get you nowhere dorky! I am far from gorgeous!"" Ashley said with a grin when she got out of Dale’s embrace and he chuckled.

""I have always been honest you know that. Let me introduce you to my friends. Tell me again that you are not gorgeous after seeing their reaction to you.”

Ashley didn’t have a choice but to go with him. Kat was not yet back from the rest room. Dale’s hand pulled hers. She frowned because they are heading to the man she never wanted to see face to face.

(Jett’s POV)

He cocked a brow. The woman was even lovelier up-close. She was so attractive and one thing was for sure. HE WANTED HER AND HE WOULD HAVE HER.

His jaw clenched when he saw that Dale was holding her hand. He felt heat came up his face. He raised his eyes to see her pretty features. When their eyes locked, his constricted because she was looking at him with something like disgust in her beautiful eyes. He didn't like that. This very desirable woman would be his no matter what.

# Chapter 2

Now that Ashley was seeing him this near this was her impression of Jett Alejandre. A manwhre, narcissist, vain, arrogant and a sleazebag. Okay she had to admit that he was also hunky, extremely good-looking but the fact was he was still a Casanova. She hated the way he was looking at her. He seemed to be stripping her and it made her want to gnash her teeth. This man might be very good-looking but she wasn’t interested. His name was familiar because it had been attached many times to a lot of female models’ and he was also involved with an aspiring singer. She almost clucked . ""You are staring and that is rude."" She heard him say. His tone had a hint of amusement.

She blinked a few times and she reprimanded herself from not realizing what she had been doing. She wasn’t aware that she was in fact staring while she was assessing this Don Juan. She threw a glance at his friends who seemed to be drooling over her. She cocked a brow. What did she expect? They are Jett’s buddies. Birds of a feather flock together.

Her eyes went back to him. ""Excuse me? I wasn't staring. I just remembered something. Aren't you the infamous model who grabs female models' behinds while on the ramp?"" she asked.

His eyes glinted and his sneer was still on his lips.

What nice lips for a guy. She thought. They were luscious and a bit reddish. She shook her head to erase her thoughts.

Two of his friends chuckled and exchanged high-fives upon hearing what she said. Dale, who was next to her just cleared his throat . Jett's eyes were intently looking at her while he deemed to want to read what was in her mind.

""So you do watch my shows. Live or online? But I just want to make one thing clear Miss...?""

""Ashley."" Came Dale’s voice.

Jett’s eyes went down to her hand which was still in Dale’s bigger one. Consciously, the latter released her before she could take back her hand.

Right after that, Jett’s eyes came back to her. She did her best to hold the stare. She could sense that he was angry about something. From her peripheral vision, she felt Dale put a distance between them.

""As I was saying Miss Ashley, I want to make things clear. I don't intentionally grab women's sses. It's either the organizers want me to do that, with the models' consent of course, to make the show more intense and interesting. Or there are even instances believe it or not that the models themselves request me to do that to them with or without the organizer's instructions. I am not complaining though."" he drawled with a smirk. His dark eyes ran on her body after saying that which made her grit her teeth.

She protruded her chin and she squinted her eyes.""Of course. A true-blue player would enjoy something like that but you didn't have to explain to me."" she said in a honeyed tone.

His eyes which were roaming on her body went up to her eyes. Dale cleared his throat again.

""Ahhm...I guess introductions are needed...Ashley this is..."" Dale began but she interrupted him.

""I don't think there is any need for that. Anyway thanks Dale."" she looked at him. ""Maybe I will see you again..."" she said with a small smile then she threw Seth. Andy and lastly Jett a glare.""…minus people who are immodest, vulgar and who looks at women like a piece of meat. I am allergic to such men. I have to go. Bye."" she added then turned her back to go to the kitchen.

Dale wanted to come after her but Jett grabbed his arm. He looked him straight in the eye which meant, don't even think about it.

With furrowed brows Dale gave up and Jett let go of his arm while still looking at Ashley’s back. A female staff walked to her.

""Dude! She called us immodest because we were drooling over her! Dang mates! Can she blame us? She is so sexy and really gorgeous!” Seth said while the four of them were looking at Ashley’s back as she talked to the staff.

""Stop staring at her morons or I will poke your eyeballs out! Just wait for me outside!” Jett hissed.

The three exchanged glances before doing what they were told. They had witnessed how Jett was when he was pissed. He was a generous friend but very scary and dangerous when he was angry.

(Ashley’s POV)

She just finished talking to Nancy when something made her look behind her. She regretted what she did. She got goose bumps. Jett who was now alone was staring at her. She snorted and walked to the kitchen. She had enough of him for today.

Her day was ruined. That Jett Alejandre was a jinx. Two of their clients this afternoon cancelled their meetings with them. She was more annoyed because Kat said she couldn’t get back to the studio due to some family matters. Only an hour left before closing time so she was thinking of closing up already instead of wasting her time. She frowned when the door opened. She almost groaned in frustration when she saw who just came in

""What are you doing here?"" Her frown deepened.

It's Jett Alejandre. He was in a plain white shirt and faded jeans. The way he was looking at her was somehow different compared to a few hours ago.

""I talked to your friend this morning and she mentioned that you have a studio."" he said with a wry smile.

She almost rolled her eyes. Kat didn’t tell her anything about their talk.

""I want to have my pictures taken for my portfolio."" He continued with a grin.

She looked away and walked to her work table."" Come back tomorrow. Kat isn’t here right now. That’s her job. I am the food and event photographer.|” she said coldly with her back on him.

""Your friend said that you do each other's job if necessary.""

""She can do that better than me.""

""Are you turning down a client? I am sure that you can do it as well as her. Or you probably don’t want to do it. Makes me wonder why…""He sounded a bit sarcastic which made her turn to him.

""And what do you mean by that?""

Jett shrugged. ""I now think that you feel uncomfortable looking at me because you are self-conscious..."" he said while he seemed to supress a sneer.

""Don't get above yourself Mr.Alejandre..."" she hissed.

""Then tell me why you are refusing a client? Your business has just started so you have to grab every client who wants your service. You can’t be like that with me."" he said matter-of-factly.

He was right of course but she would rather die than apologize to him. She jutted her chin. ""Well then let's not waste time. I almost forgot that you are a well-known model and doing business with you will be good for us. So let’s get started then, sir. Where is your entourage, your wardrobe assistant and make-up artist?"" she asked sarcastically as she gets her camera ready.

""I don't need them.""

Her back was on him as she arranged the set. ""You need them because your pictures are for your portfolio right?"" she asked .

""I want it in the raw."" he said which froze her. ""I am ready when you are."" He added in a bedroom voice.

She slowly turned and she groaned and closed her eyes for a second or two. He was bare-chested already. How did she get into this situation? She would strangle Kat tomorrow.

""Take a few shots of me in my jeans first then in my birthday suit.” He was grinning from ear to ear while his eyes went down her body. .

My seats are leather so those cleaned up fairly nicely, but a lot of the rest of my interior is carpet. I’m *terrified* of mold and the thought of milk rotting in my car is enough for me to panic. 

I’ve gone in twice with a spray cleaner and dish soap on a bristle brush and hit every part of the carpeted area that I can reach, as well as hosed down all of my floor mats (they’re rubber). Is that likely to be enough? There’s still a little coffee smell lingering under the cleaner smells but I don’t think I can smell any milk rotting. I live in an apartment so I don’t have access to outdoor outlets to hook up a rug cleaner or I’d do it myself, but I’m also not exactly rolling in dough at the moment so I’m attempting it myself for that reason also 😅 

Like I said, I’m legitimately terrified of mold and need to KNOW that my car has been cleaned out. If there’s anything else I can do, I’ll do it. How will I know it’s been cleaned up before it rots and is too late? Can I even know that? Do I need to hire a detailer/deep cleaner? 

Sorry if this is confusing, I’m very worried about mold and it’s scary. I’m happy to answer any other questions. ",2,1748606217.0,CleaningTips,4,1.0,False

Ulcers in Terminal Ileum, FCP fluctuating <100, Pain, discomfort 7 months 15 kg weight loss, Old IBS, recent HPylori.","Hi... I'm very new to this and in the maybe zone for very early stage Crohn's as per my GI in India and my cousin who's am IBD specialist in Canada. Long post down below.

Short history below

IBS since 2009, mostly functional, slow motility, delayed gastric emptying, incomplete evacuation. Referred for psychiatric medication, very bad experience of very strong drugs from 2020 to 23. Withdrew all. Stabilized and then sudden symptomps as follows:

November 2024 - sudden extreme violent diahorrea with vasovegal symptoms and stomach ache one night after alcohol which I was avoiding since many weeks. 

This continued for a couple of weeks and more diahorrea and vasovagal episodes happened. All usual doctors were ibs flare, which I did not believe as I knew this seymotoms well. Treated like ibs for 2 months. 

Endoscopy- visually Clear (no biopsy taken)
FCP- 50

Symptomps continued : Gas triggered mild pain, Vasovegal type feeling before defacation.

January 2025 - 
Enterography-  revealed thickening in a small section of terminal ileum

Colonoscopy - revealed Ulcers in terminal ileum. 

Biopsy - Severely inflamed non specific (granulomas and TB absent).

FCP - 87

Feb 2025 - 
Capsule endoscopy revealed same Ulcers in terminal ileum reat of ileum clean.

Was on semi elemental Low fodmap dysbiosis reset diet in January, followed by low fodmap low fibre in February. 

March 2025 - 
symptoms stabilized. FCP 10

April 2025 - 
Tried re introducing dairy, very mild coffee and dark chocolate over a week. 

Symptoms - All symptoms back. Stomach ache, Pain with gas, mild vasovrgal feeling.

FCP 67.

Again went back on low fiber low fodmap diet. Got stomach ache now as a symptom after acidic or any food, also before defacation and during. Diet went very low to negligible.

May 2025 - 
Colonoscopy - ulcers still there, in a line as per doctor, looks like increased since capsule endoscopy.

Biopsy - Revealed moderate inflammation in ulcers mild crypt changes but no granulomas (TB negative). No inflammation on non ulcer part.

Enteroscopy - revealed HPylori and surface erosion of gastric lining, deuodenm clear.

Biopsy of Deoudenum - Mild inflammation and mild ESR involvement.

Treatment: vonaprazon Amoxicillin bismuth for h pylori. Anti spasmodic for pain mebverine. DGL, zinc carnisoine self.

Current Diet - low residue low fodmap white diwt again since 5 weeks. 3.5 kg lost weight.

Total 15 kg lost in 7 months.

Current symptoms - stomach ache after food (erosive gastritis left over) and discomfort and mild to moderate pain before and during defacation. Unable to try any new or normal food.

Apologies for such a long post. Don't know what to do now. Maybe an overlap of dysbiosis IBS and now maybe crohn's.

The GI says looks like early stage crohn's because of the way the ulcers are lined up in a straight line and they have not receded in 7 months. He has asked to do a trial of mesalamine. My cousin the IBD specialist in Canada is saying to do a 8 week trial of Budesonide 9 mg. (I also have a cross complication of having chronic hepatitis B positive, never affected LFT till now, no treatment taken ever, but doubt if bidesonide might reactivate?)

Any advice of anyone having gone through this or similar situation? 

Note- Treatment in India is not insurance dependent and cost of medication one of the lowest in the world.

Modular Majesty: Philosophy in Sound and Movement
By Professor Jemima Stackridge (Queen Jemima)

When I returned to Fenland University College in the early 1990s, after my extended and classified tenure in East Germany, I found myself changed in subtle and unshakeable ways. My time within the British Intelligence Services—operating under aliases, attending embassy functions in the persona of Princess von Steckreich—had deepened my belief in the power of performance. Not only as deception, but as revelation. I had witnessed first-hand how symbols, rituals, and personas could influence the real world. And I was determined to channel that insight into art.

I resumed my academic work in Philosophy and Performance Art, but with a new urgency. My experiences demanded expression, and the raw material of that expression would be sound—shaped, ordered, alive. I purchased a Doepfer modular synthesizer with the modest stipend attached to my returning Fellowship. It was not an institutional acquisition like the EMS Synthi of my student days, but a personal investment—one that signalled my commitment to this next stage of creative life, as Queen Jemima, a regal persona embodying my belief in the moral and metaphysical potential of aesthetic form.

The Doepfer system, unlike the all-in-one synths of earlier decades, invited a top-down approach to composition. I would begin not with melody or timbre, but with a concept—often drawn from my ongoing philosophical work. For example: the question of divine immanence; the instability of the self in performance; or the dialectic of observer and observed. These ideas would be translated into patch diagrams—modular schemata designed to explore contrast, resonance, feedback. The sounds were at first recorded in my studio and played back during performances, often staged in ecclesiastical or academic settings where I would move with solemn, ritualistic precision, every gesture an echo of the underlying logic.

But the real breakthrough came when Heather Sandra Wigston joined me—not only as a creative partner, but as a profound emotional companion. I first encountered her performing avant-garde synthesizer music at the Fahrenheit coffee house, and I sensed immediately that she heard structure the way I moved through it. It was not long before I invited her to my home, and later to the stage.

Together, we evolved the method that now defines our collaborative work: live modular interpretation of philosophical dance. In performance, I move—not randomly, but deliberately, as Queen Jemima, embodying a metaphysical principle. Heather watches, listens, feels. She responds in real time, manipulating the Doepfer’s voltage-controlled modules, oscillators, filters. Her sounds are not accompaniment, but reply. And I, in turn, adapt—allowing her sonic interpretations to feed back into my body, creating a true dialectic of motion and music.

We call this process Reciprocal Modulation, and it remains central to our practice today. It is a discipline of presence, patience, and trust—each of us attuned not only to our instruments, but to one another. In the echo between gesture and sound, thought becomes audible. Philosophy becomes danceable.

At Fenland, in our modest chapel or beneath the vast East Anglian sky, Heather and I continue to perform together—two women, two minds, one circuit of perpetual inquiry.

After giving feedback in a calm and non-aggressive manner that it ""it wasn't cool to use racial slur"" this person has since weaponised silence as a tool to create distance, avoid accountability and further discussion in the group dynamic.

I am the only person of colour in the group and since this happened nearly 4 months ago, the silence has gotten louder. I recently learned an insight about myself - which is whenever I have experienced *non-violent f*orms of racism, this has been my usual reaction - pretending like it didn't happen, repress the experience and go off into Lalaland. 

However, I'm now realising I need to find a way to use my voice otherwise I'm also playing a role by enabling the silence and allowing the use of such words in a professional setting, which indicates to the all white group that this type of behaviour is ok.

I'm just worried about my own safety within the group and bringing up topics like the normalisation of racism in dynamics of majority white spaces, weaponisation of silence and white fragility (person of colour invited into the group to talk about race > gives real-time feedback in a non-offensive/aggressive manner > the person/group has their 'im a good person' identity threatened' > now the poc has to deprioritise their experience of being hurt (almost like it never happened)> the topic pivots away from racism into managing the feelings and experiences of the oppressor).

My partner tells me I should speak to the group about it (a mini 10min talk) as it's less about the racism (as it's highly unlikely the worlds racism problems are going to be solved in this group hah!) but more about me feeling empowered to use my voice.

My periods coming! 

Context: I was on birth control for 10 years and stopped July 2024. Had a MC in November 2024, and since then my periods have been nonexistent, having to be induced with provera.
I’m spotting! It’s coming! This is the first NATURAL period since starting birth control. 

I don’t know if it’s fully the path I’ve been taking, but in case it is, here’s what I’ve been doing!  
-I started traditional medicinals raspberry leaf tea (1 cup minimum) daily on 5/12/25 and ran out 5/27/25
-I added traditional medicinals healthy cycle tea 5/18/25 and drank both until I ran out of the raspberry. 
-I started adding .5tsp of yellow maca root to my coffee in the morning 5/18/25. After a few days I increased to 1tsp. This wasn’t as consistent since I thought my nicotine withdrawal insomnia was the maca (no) so I resumed it 5/28/25
-quit vaping 5/23/25 (haven’t touched any nicotine) 
-included a sleep gummy (thanks nic withdrawals) that are no melatonin but b6 and magnesium, they’re wonderful and actually work too. 

Hopefully if anyone is down the Google or Reddit rabbit hole that is going through something similar to me, finds this and knows it’ll get better. Those hormones are finicky but it’ll get better. 

TLDR: irregular cycle finally coming naturally rather than with provera. Added tea and maca routine and other factors. ",2,1748605567.0,herbalism,1,1.0,False

* **NioCorp is developing a fully permitted critical minerals mine and processing facility in Nebraska, targeting niobium, scandium, titanium, and magnetic rare earths—materials that the U.S. largely imports.**
* **With $20 million recently raised, NioCorp now has the funds to finalize technical studies and aims to reach a Final Investment Decision (FID) by early 2026.**
* **The company has binding agreements for a significant portion of its niobium and scandium output, including deals with Thyssenkrupp and Traxys USA, and is in discussions for rare earths with Stellantis.**
* **NioCorp is working closely with the U.S. EXIM Bank for debt financing (\~$800M) under a critical minerals strategy strongly supported by recent Trump administration executive orders.**
* **CEO Mark Smith and the team bring rare earth processing expertise from Molycorp; the Nebraska project also benefits from strong local and state government backing.**

NioCorp Developments Ltd. (TSX: NB, NASDAQ: NB) is advancing a vertically integrated critical minerals project in southeast Nebraska, positioning itself as a strategic supplier of four key materials: niobium, scandium, titanium, and magnetic rare earth elements (REEs). With full permits in hand and a recent capital infusion to complete technical studies, NioCorp aims to reach a Final Investment Decision (FID) by early 2026.

In a recent interview, CEO and Executive Chairman Mark Smith provided detailed insight into the project’s development status, funding strategy, offtake agreements, metallurgical advancements, and government support. The interview also highlighted NioCorp’s unique market position, particularly given the U.S. dependence on imports for these critical materials.

# A Broad and Growing Market for Critical Minerals

The Elk Creek project stands out for its diversity of revenue streams. Niobium is used to enhance the strength of steel, and scandium serves a similar function for aluminum. Titanium is in high demand for aerospace and military applications, while magnetic rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium are essential for high-performance permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, defense systems, and wind turbines.

This product mix gives NioCorp exposure to both infrastructure-driven demand and the accelerating electrification and defense sectors. Importantly, the project is designed to process all four materials through a single integrated facility, offering cost synergies and risk diversification.

# Secured Offtakes De-Risk the Project

NioCorp has secured binding offtake agreements covering a large share of its expected production:

* **Niobium**: Thyssenkrupp (Germany) will purchase 50% of the ferro-niobium output, with another 25% committed to CMC Cometals (U.S.).
* **Scandium**: A 10-year agreement with Traxys USA covers approximately 12 tonnes per year, currently the largest scandium contract known.
* **Rare Earths**: NioCorp is working with Stellantis as a prospective 100% offtake partner for its magnetic REEs.

The company is also in discussions with UK-based automakers on scandium alloys, indicating broader international commercial interest.

# Robust Government Backing and Debt Financing from EXIM Bank

NioCorp’s most significant funding partner is the U.S. Export-Import (EXIM) Bank, which has advanced the company through initial approval stages and indicated willingness to provide approximately $800 million in debt financing. The company expects this loan to be structured as a 10-year note, tied to Treasury rates plus a risk premium - effectively the lowest cost of capital currently available.

The remaining \~$400 million in equity will need to be raised, though the recent $20 million financing round has allowed NioCorp to progress toward FID without needing smaller, survival-based capital raises.

# Technical Advancements and Capex Optimization

Since the 2022 Feasibility Study (FS), NioCorp has implemented key changes that could reduce capital costs and improve recoveries:

* Replacing twin shafts with twin ramps, cutting capex by \~$188 million and accelerating the timeline by six months.
* Eliminating the need for a sulfuric acid plant, saving \~$100 million.
* Increasing rare earth oxide recoveries to \~92% through hydrometallurgical improvements.

Though inflation adjustments may offset some gains. Referencing the prior FS capex estimate, Smith noted:

These optimizations are being finalized through feasibility-level engineering by contractors who are already intimately familiar with the project.

# Proven Permits and Experienced Execution Team

One of NioCorp’s competitive advantages is that it already holds all major permits required for construction—an uncommon achievement among U.S. mining peers. Smith also emphasized the strength of the team, particularly its rare earth expertise derived from Molycorp’s operations at the Mountain Pass Mine.

Engineering and construction partners include Zachry Group (surface plant) and Dumas Mining (underground development), both of whom are long-time collaborators on the project.

# Timeline and Ramp-Up

NioCorp’s timeline calls for:

* **FID**: Late 2025 or early 2026.
* **Construction**: Approximately three years.
* **Ramp-up**: Six months to reach nameplate production.

Importantly, offtake contracts for niobium are structured to accommodate the gradual production increase. Smith emphasized that by the time of commissioning, the company expects to have over 20 years of proven reserves, exceeding EXIM’s requirements.

# Local Support and Economic Development

NioCorp has received strong support from the state of Nebraska across three gubernatorial administrations. The project is expected to generate significant employment and economic uplift for a region that has historically struggled with youth outmigration.

The company has also secured local tax incentives and enjoys robust community and regulatory alignment, further de-risking the development path.

# The Investment Thesis for NioCorp

* **Multi-Mineral Exposure**: Investors gain exposure to four critical minerals with diverse industrial applications and strong long-term demand fundamentals.
* **Permitted and Advanced**: Fully permitted with technical studies nearly complete, NioCorp is closer to construction than most U.S. peers in the critical minerals space.
* **Strong Offtake Coverage**: Binding agreements already in place for \~75% of niobium, 100% of scandium, and discussions for 100% of rare earths support cash flow visibility.
* **Government Support**: Access to low-cost debt via the U.S. EXIM Bank positions NioCorp as a flagship project within national critical mineral strategies.
* **Proven Leadership and Engineering**: Veteran team with rare earth processing experience from Molycorp, and committed EPC contractors already engaged.
* **Capex Optimization**: Recent engineering changes may reduce capital requirements by \~$300 million versus the 2022 study, despite inflation pressures.
* **Community Backing**: Strong state and local support reduce permitting and social license risks, aiding long-term operational security.
* **Strategic Location**: Located in the U.S. heartland, the project is well-positioned to serve North American and European critical mineral supply chains.

# Macro Thematic Analysis

The NioCorp project is emblematic of a broader trend toward reshoring supply chains for critical minerals essential to national security, energy transition, and high-tech manufacturing. The U.S. remains almost entirely dependent on imports for niobium, scandium, and magnetic rare earths—materials vital for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and defense systems.

This vulnerability has prompted bipartisan action across U.S. administrations. Recent executive orders under the Trump administration, combined with low-cost financing from institutions like the EXIM Bank, highlight a shift from rhetoric to implementation.

***Smith underscored the urgency:***

***The transition from Chinese-dominated processing and supply toward diversified and domestic solutions is no longer speculative. For investors, NioCorp offers a vehicle aligned with long-term structural tailwinds in materials security, national policy, and global industrial transformation.***

1kz1yaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Type1Diabetes/comments/1kz1yaw/is_my_high_risk_diabetes_in_pregnancy_doctor_an/,Is my high risk diabetes in pregnancy doctor an absolute quack?,"This is gonna be a bit long so please stick around, I desperately need other opinions. I (25F) have had type 1 diabetes since I was barely 9 years old and have been managing by myself since I was about 14 after my mom passed away. I have never had good experiences with endocrinologists, but I am now 25 weeks pregnant with my first baby and am seeing a “high risk” doctors office. 

Now, despite my past of not being a perfect diabetic, I consider myself pretty damn knowledgeable about the disease as it’s been at the front of my mind for the past 16 years. Since being pregnant, my glucose levels look better than they ever have in my life due to myself being extremely vigilant, counting every carbohydrate, checking glucose 10+ times a day etc. My levels are in range 75% of the time. 

I had an appointment with this doctor yesterday, we’ll call him Dr S, and despite my glucose levels being good for the most part, he changed ALL OF MY MEDICATIONS. And not just a little, but a lot. 

I drink coffee every morning (with OB approval.) as I’m sure some of you know, coffee spikes sugar very fast. I have been pre-bolusing 20 mins in advance for my coffee and am still seeing spikes. This is the ONLY thing consistently wrong with my levels that needed fixed, which could have been solved by bolusing sooner and perhaps a slightly higher dose. Nothing else in my day to day needed changing, and my blood sugar log showed him that very clearly. 
Regardless of this, he decided to up my Lantus by 5 units (I take it in the morning.) from 31 units to 36 for no reason?? He also changed my insulin to carb ratio from 1:8 to 1:6 for the whole day. 
I also take an NPH insulin at night to help with my fasting glucose levels in the morning. The highest number I had for fasting was 184 and that was one day out of a week. Because of this one outlier, he changed my dosage from 8 units to 14 of the NPH. The first night of me taking this I was sent low twice in an 8 hour period. 

Another issue - in a weeks worth of logged glucose levels, I have ONE low sugar of 64. Dr S points to this number and tells me he wants me to stop pre-bolusing for my food and start taking my insulin during my last bite so I have a more precise calculation of carbs…..huh????? This goes against everything I’ve ever been taught in my life, and to change something like this because of one low level, just doesn’t sound like a good idea. 

I came to Reddit because I’m concerned. I don’t want to follow a single one of these medication changes. It all seems too drastic and somewhat unnecessary. I also try to keep the opinion that I am not a doctor. But my gut is screaming at me not to jump straight into these new dosages. I am scared of dangerous lows, which can also become very expensive and problematic when I don’t have a pantry fully stocked with juices and puddings and snacks while at work 8 hours of the day.

I want to do what’s right for my baby, and that usually means following doctor’s orders. But what do you do when doctor’s orders scare and concern you as much as these concern me?

Any thoughts from medical professionals and T1D warriors alike are welcome! Thanks!

I woke up to the sound of my alarm slowly getting louder and I waited for the chiming bells to stop before I rolled over and hit the screen. With a deep breath, I muster the energy to get out of the bed and drag myself to the shower. I had a job interview today and I needed to be there early so that I won't be labeled as a late comer. Quickly taking my shower, I did my morning routine before getting myself ready for the day and headed to the venue where the interview will be held.

I got there almost before eight-thirty in the morning, the interview is scheduled for nine in the morning. I always like to be early, I hated doing things at the rush hour. But now, my patience is running out and my legs are bouncing up in frustration. It is already half past nine yet no one showed up and I have been waiting for more than an hour.

After several months of job hunting and my years in the university. I am finally getting the opportunity to work in one of the biggest companies in the country, Dangote Group of industries. When I was twelve years old, I read about two brothers, Griffin and Justin Creed who started the company years ago right out of college.

I followed the company from that time on, I got my General Education Development at the age of fifteen and got full academic scholarships to one of the top universities in the country. After several years of schooling, I finally got my degrees and masters. And when I reached a point where I felt qualified on the educational level, I tried to find a job in the company but I had no luck.

It has been ten months since I finished my last degree and aside from some very low-paying internship, I have been out of luck on the job front. For the past four months, I worked at a struggling coffee shop and tried to use my expertise to help keep the door open.

Right when I started working at the coffee shop, I saw a job vacancy at Dangote Group of industries and applied instantly. After three months of waiting, I was finally called in for an interview when I was about to give up on hope. But the bakery was able to keep gas in my car and I was able to make minimum payment on my loans but I was almost homeless and had barely any money in my name.

So here I am, waiting for almost an hour. I let out a sigh and checked my watch again, who knew a place so established like this company would keep me waiting this long? I glance around the lobby, there was a security team at one desk near the door and a receptionist on the other side in the section I was sitting. The place was stark white with light blue and silver accents, luckily the chairs were comfortable. The receptionist, a petite blonde girl glance at me and send a sympathetic smile for the millionth time, if only she would stop looking at me and fucking call someone to assist me.

I checked my time again, and it was almost ten o'clock. And just as I was about to go talk to the receptionist, the elevator on the right side of the desk pinged and opened and a very gorgeous man stepped off and headed in my direction.

Holy hell, he had dark hair and beautiful ocean blue eyes. He walked towards me as if he was walking down a runway, model perfect and gorgeous in a crisp dark brown suit with gold cuffs.

""Miss, Clover?"" He said in a deep voice that had the hint of an accent. He extended his hand and I took his hand in a handshake.

He stood a few inches over my height in heels, I snaked my eyes up his chest till I met his sparkling eyes. They were clear blue like the sky and held me captivated.

""Hello,"" I said, sliding my hand out of his and he stared at me for a second too long before blinking slowly.

""I am Logan Walker, one of the partners here."" He said smiling softly showing two dimples in his cheeks.

A small pang of disappointment hit me, there were only pictures of Justin Creed and I don't know what Griffin looked like but I was hoping the man that was in front of me, the one that would be interviewing me would be him but I was wrong.

""I am sorry for the delay, I was just told you were down here waiting. We were training some new assistant who apparently did not know how to relay a message."" He said, the more he spoke, the more I realized he had a Greek accent. He is not from this country.

""Come with me, let's head to my office. I am not a fan of big impersonal meeting rooms for one-on-one interviews."" He said, gesturing towards the elevator, I nodded and grabbed my bag and credentials.

When he turned his back to head to the elevator, I fixed my clothes. I had been sitting for so long, when my mother was alive, she had so many amazing outfits and this piece I am wearing now was one of them. It was a crop jacket and high waist pants suit in black soft wool, it was probably my favorite. I added a white tank that I found at the thrift store, it was also cropped so I had to make sure I pulled it down so that my mid drift didn't show. I added some strappy silver heels that made me feel mature and sophisticated.

I put my curly hair in a loose bun and did light makeup. I wanted to hide my freckles because it made me look younger. I watched his back as he walked, he had to be one of the handsomest men I had ever met. He was lean but he had an athletic build and the suit fit him like a glove. He has a very nice ass too, if I took a guess, I would place him just over six feet.

A few inappropriate thoughts flew through my head. He could fold me like a pretzel. Fuck, why did I just think that?

I hurried to catch up to him, my heels sounded way too loud on the beautiful marble floor. The elevator doors were opening by the time I caught up and I hurriedly followed him on. He raised an eyebrow in my direction, causing me to flush and the corner of his mouth tipped up a little bit.",1,1748604900.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Maybe Bangalore just spoiled me with more direct communication? Or different investor pressure there?

1kz1wy5,https://youtu.be/ethlm3pKUI8,3 Very Scary TRUE Suburban From the 1980s Horror Stories,"# ""Shush"":

I lived in Wylie, Texas, a sleepy suburb where life revolved around church potlucks, kids’ soccer games, and neatly trimmed lawns. It was the 1980s, and our neighborhood was a picture of calm—two-story houses with white shutters, driveways lined with station wagons, and mailboxes with little red flags. My home was no different: a cozy brick house with a big kitchen where I’d spend mornings baking cookies for my daughter’s school bake sales or cutting crusts off sandwiches for her lunch. I was a housewife, always at the community center or church, chatting with other moms, organizing fundraisers. Everyone saw me as cheerful, dependable, the kind of woman who had it all together. But I was hiding something that would tear it all apart.It started in 1978 at our church’s choir practice. Allan, a quiet man with kind eyes, was married to Betty, a schoolteacher who lived a few streets over. Their daughter was my daughter’s best friend, so we saw them often—at school events, barbecues, birthday parties. Allan and I got to talking one evening after practice, laughing about the kids or the latest sermon. There was a spark, something dangerous. Soon, we were stealing glances, then sneaking phone calls. By late 1978, we were meeting at a motel outside town, far from Wylie’s prying eyes. It was thrilling—the secrecy, the rush of doing something forbidden. I told myself it was harmless, that no one would get hurt. But it wasn’t harmless. It was a bomb waiting to go off.The affair lasted a few months. Allan ended it in late 1979, saying he loved Betty and wanted to save his marriage. I agreed, though it stung. I buried the guilt, focused on my family, my routines. I thought I’d left it behind, that life could go back to normal. I was wrong.June 13, 1980, started like any other day. My daughter, eight years old and full of energy, was excited for a sleepover at Betty’s house. She needed her swimsuit for a pool party the next day, so I promised to grab it from Betty’s. I drove over around noon, the familiar streets lined with kids on bikes and sprinklers ticking in yards. Betty’s house was a split-level with a tidy flowerbed out front, marigolds blooming bright. I knocked, and she answered, her face pale, her smile forced.“Hey, just here for the swimsuit,” I said, trying to sound cheerful.“Come in,” she said, her voice flat. She led me to the kitchen, where dishes were stacked neatly in the sink, and the air smelled of coffee and fresh laundry. Her baby was napping upstairs, and the older kids were at school. I noticed her hands fidgeting, twisting a dish towel.“Betty, you okay?” I asked, setting my purse on the counter.She turned, her eyes like knives. “I know about you and Allan.”My heart stopped. I felt the room shrink, the walls pressing in. I forced a shaky smile, my hands clammy. “Betty, I’m so sorry. It was a long time ago, a stupid mistake. It’s over.”“Over?” Her voice was low, sharp, like she was holding back a scream. “You think you can just walk into my house, into my life, after what you did?”I stepped back, my pulse racing. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. It was wrong, I know that. Allan ended it because he loves you.”“Loves me?” She laughed, bitter and cold. “Don’t lie to me. I found the notes, the motel receipts. You think I’m stupid?”My throat tightened. “I’m not lying,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “Please, Betty, let’s talk about this. I’ll do anything to make it right.”She pointed to the utility room off the kitchen. “The swimsuit’s in there. Get it yourself.” Her words were ice, her eyes never leaving mine.I nodded, desperate to defuse the tension. The utility room was cramped, with a washer and dryer pushed against one wall, a shelf of detergent and cleaning supplies, and a wood-handled ax leaning in the corner, probably for chopping firewood for their backyard firepit. I found the swimsuit in a laundry basket, a bright pink one-piece. But when I turned, Betty was in the doorway, holding the ax.“Betty, what are you doing?” My voice trembled. I dropped the swimsuit, my hands up, palms out, like I could push away the fear.“You think you can just move on?” she said, her voice shaking with rage. “You ruined my marriage, my family.”“Put it down,” I pleaded, my back against the washer, the cold metal pressing into my spine. “We can fix this. Think of the kids—yours, mine. Please.”She stepped closer, her knuckles white around the ax handle. “Don’t you dare talk about my kids.”My heart pounded so hard I thought it might burst. “Betty, I’m begging you. I’m so sorry. Let’s just talk.”She raised the ax, her eyes wild, tears streaming down her face. “Shush,” she hissed, like she was silencing a child.That word—shush—hit me like a lightning bolt. It yanked me back to my childhood, to my mother’s angry voice, shushing me when I cried after she’d scream at me for spilling juice or forgetting a chore. I’d cower in my room, terrified, swallowing my sobs. Something inside me broke. My vision blurred, my body moved without thought. I lunged, grabbing her wrist, the ax between us. We struggled, stumbling against the washer, the ax clattering against the floor. I don’t know how it ended up in my hands. I don’t remember swinging it. I just remember the blood.When my mind cleared, I was standing over her, the ax heavy in my hands. Betty was on the floor, her body still, blood pooling around her, soaking into the linoleum. My hands were slick, my clothes drenched. I counted later, in my head, trying to make sense of it—41 times, they said. I dropped the ax, my legs shaking, and stumbled back, my breath coming in gasps. I was horrified, frozen, staring at what I’d done.Panic took over. I tried to clean up, grabbing rags from the shelf, scrubbing the floor, but the blood kept spreading, staining everything. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I went to Betty’s bathroom, stripped off my clothes, and showered, the water turning pink as it swirled down the drain. I found a blouse and jeans in her closet, too big but clean, and put them on. I grabbed the swimsuit, left my bloody clothes in a bag, and drove home, my daughter’s chatter in the car a distant hum against the screaming in my head.That night, I made dinner, helped with homework, tucked my daughter into bed. I smiled, nodded, acted like nothing was wrong. But inside, I was unraveling. Allan found Betty’s body that evening when he got home from work. The police came to my door the next morning. They’d found traces of my visit—my fingerprints, the blood I couldn’t fully clean. They knew about the affair, pieced it together from neighbors who’d seen my car.The trial was a blur. I sat in the courtroom, my hands folded, listening as my lawyer explained it was self-defense. I told them about the ax, how Betty came at me, how that word—shush—made something in me snap. They brought in a doctor who said I’d had a dissociative reaction, triggered by childhood trauma. My mother’s voice, her shushing, had buried itself deep, and Betty’s words brought it back. The jury listened, their faces unreadable. After eight days, they came back with a verdict: not guilty.I was free, but I wasn’t. I moved away from Wylie, changed my name, tried to start over in a new town where no one knew me. But I carry it with me—the image of Betty’s body, the blood on my hands, the sound of that word. The suburbs, with their tidy houses and friendly waves, hide things. Secrets, anger, pain. I learned that the hard way. Every night, I see her face, hear her voice. “Shush.” It’s a sound I’ll never escape.

  


# ""Shoelaces and Secrets"":

I was 25, living in a cozy two-bedroom house in a quiet Sacramento suburb in 1978. My husband, Tom, and I had moved there the year before, drawn by the tidy lawns, kids chasing each other on bikes, and the smell of barbecues drifting through the air. Our street was lined with ranch-style homes, each with a small front yard and rose bushes by the mailbox. It felt like the perfect place to start a family, a place where nothing bad could happen. But that summer, everything changed, and the safety I’d taken for granted unraveled like a frayed sweater.It started with the phone calls. The first one came on a Tuesday night, around 11 p.m. The sharp ring jolted me awake, my heart thudding as I fumbled for the receiver on the nightstand. “Hello?” I said, my voice groggy. No answer. Just silence, thick and heavy, then a faint sound—breathing. Slow, deliberate breaths, like someone was holding the phone too close. I froze, my fingers tightening around the receiver. “Who is this?” I asked, louder. The breathing stopped, and the line went dead. I set the phone down, my hands trembling. “Wrong number,” I told Tom, who was half-asleep beside me. He mumbled, “Probably,” and rolled over. But I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, my stomach twisting. It didn’t feel like a mistake.The calls kept coming—two, sometimes three times a week, always late at night. The phone would ring, shrill and insistent, cutting through the quiet house. I’d stare at it, willing it to stop, but it never did until the answering machine clicked on. No message, just that breathing, heavy and slow, like the caller was savoring the silence. I stopped picking up after the third call, but the sound of the ring alone made my pulse race. I’d lie in bed, counting the rings—five, six, seven—until they stopped. Tom suggested we unplug the phone at night, but I couldn’t. What if it was an emergency? What if it was my mom, or his sister? So we left it plugged in, and I dreaded every night.Then the break-ins started. Not our house, not yet, but close enough to make my skin crawl. Our neighbor Linda, a kind woman with two young kids and a laugh that carried across the street, told me about it one morning. I was watering the petunias by our front gate when she walked over, her arms crossed tight. “You hear about the Johnsons?” she asked, her eyes darting to the street. I shook my head. “Someone broke into their garage last night,” she said. “Took some loose change, a flashlight, and—God, this is creepy—some of Ellen’s underwear from the laundry basket.” My mouth went dry. “Who does that?” I asked. Linda shrugged, her face pale. “Police think it’s the same guy hitting other houses. They’re calling him a prowler. Been happening all over the neighborhood.”I couldn’t shake her words. That night, I checked every lock in the house—front door, back door, the sliding glass door to the patio, every window. I tugged on the handles, making sure they wouldn’t budge. The deadbolt’s click felt like my only shield. Tom noticed my new routine and frowned. “You’re worrying too much,” he said, but he started checking the locks too. The neighborhood gossip spread like wildfire. At the grocery store, I overheard women in the cereal aisle whispering about more break-ins—sheds, garages, small things taken. One woman said her neighbor found her back gate unlatched, with muddy footprints leading to her patio. No one saw the guy, but everyone felt his presence, like a shadow creeping closer.A couple of weeks later, Tom and I went to a neighborhood watch meeting at the community center down the street. The room was packed, maybe 40 people squeezed into folding chairs, the air thick with nervous energy. A police officer stood at the front, his uniform crisp but his face tired. He held up a sketch of a man in a ski mask, just eyes and a mouth cut out. “We believe it’s one person,” he said. “He’s careful. Wears gloves, covers his face. Takes things you might not notice right away—jewelry, coins, personal items.” A woman in the back raised her hand. “Is he dangerous?” she asked, her voice shaking. The officer paused, his jaw tight. “He’s escalating,” he said. “Last week, he broke into a couple’s home on Elm Street. Tied them up with shoelaces, threatened them. Didn’t hurt them, but he could’ve.” The room went silent. I grabbed Tom’s hand, my palms clammy. My mind flashed to the breathing on the phone. Was it him?Linda, sitting next to me, leaned over, her voice barely a whisper. “I talked to Ellen Johnson,” she said. “She said he whispered to them. Told them not to scream, or he’d kill them. He stacked dishes on the husband’s back—said if they fell, he’d know they moved.” Her hands shook as she clutched her purse. “What kind of person thinks like that?” I couldn’t answer. My throat felt like it was closing up. I glanced at Tom, his face pale, his eyes fixed on the officer. When we got home, we bought new locks—big, heavy ones—and a baseball bat we kept by the bed.The fear settled into our lives like dust. I stopped going for evening walks. I’d flinch at every car that slowed down on our street. One night, Tom was working late at the hardware store, and I was home alone. Around 10 p.m., the phone rang. I stared at it, my heart pounding, but didn’t pick up. The answering machine clicked on, and there it was—those heavy breaths, slow and deliberate. I yanked the phone cord out of the wall, my hands shaking so hard I dropped it. Then I heard it: scratch, scratch, scratch at the back door, like nails on wood. My legs felt like jelly, but I forced myself to move. I crept to the kitchen, my bare feet cold on the linoleum, and peeked through the blinds. The backyard was dark, the rose bushes swaying slightly. Then I saw it—a shadow, quick and low, darting behind the wooden fence. It was human-shaped, but too fast to make out details. My breath caught, and I stumbled back, knocking over a chair. The crash echoed in the quiet house.I grabbed the kitchen phone—thank God we had a second line—and called the police. “I think someone’s outside,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “Please hurry.” The dispatcher told me to lock the doors and stay calm. I clutched a butcher knife from the drawer, my hands slick with sweat, and sat on the couch, staring at the back door. Every creak of the house, every rustle outside, made my heart leap. The police arrived 20 minutes later, their flashlights cutting through the darkness. An officer, young with a buzz cut, knocked on the door. “Ma’am, we checked the yard,” he said. “No one’s there now, but your gate’s unlatched. Found some scuff marks in the dirt.” He pointed to the path by the rose bushes. “Could’ve been him. Stay vigilant.” I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. That night, I left every light in the house on.The next morning, I told Linda everything over coffee at her kitchen table. Her kids were at school, and the house felt too quiet. “You saw him?” she asked, her eyes wide, her coffee cup trembling in her hands. “I don’t know,” I said, my voice cracking. “Just a shadow. But it was someone. I felt it.” She nodded, her fingers shredding a napkin. “They found shoelaces in the Millers’ yard last night,” she said. “Two streets over. He tried to get in but couldn’t. Left them by the back door, like a warning.” My stomach churned. “Shoelaces?” I asked. She nodded. “Same as the attacks. He uses them to tie people up.” I pushed my coffee away, suddenly nauseous.The attacks kept coming. A week later, the news reported another couple hit, this time on a street just a mile away. He’d tied them up, same shoelaces, same whispered threats. The husband fought back and got a broken nose for it. The police released more sketches—dark clothing, ski mask, average build. Every man I saw became a suspect. The guy delivering our mail, the neighbor mowing his lawn, even the teenager riding his bike too slowly—they all made my heart race. I stopped sleeping. I’d lie awake, listening for footsteps, for that scratch at the door. Tom started coming home early, his face drawn. “We’re okay,” he’d say, but he’d check the windows twice before bed.One night, I woke up to a sound I’ll never forget. Footsteps, slow and deliberate, crunching on the gravel path outside our bedroom window. Not the soft patter of a cat or a raccoon—human steps, careful, like someone didn’t want to be heard. I shook Tom awake, my nails digging into his arm. “Listen,” I hissed. He sat up, his eyes wide. The steps moved toward the back door, pausing, then a faint click—the doorknob turning, testing the lock. My heart pounded so hard I thought it would burst. “Don’t move,” I whispered, tears streaming down my face. Tom reached for the baseball bat, his hands shaking. The steps continued, circling the house, then stopped. We sat there, frozen, waiting for another sound. Nothing. At dawn, we checked outside. Footprints in the dirt by the rose bushes, leading to the street. One print was clear—a sneaker, pressed deep into the soft soil.That was the breaking point. The next morning, I called a realtor. Tom didn’t argue. “We can’t stay,” I said, my voice flat. He nodded, his jaw tight. “I know.” Linda came over that afternoon, her eyes red from crying. “You’re leaving?” she asked, standing in our living room, surrounded by half-packed boxes. “We have to,” I said. “I can’t keep waiting for him to come back.” She hugged me, her body trembling. “I’m thinking about it too,” she said. “No one feels safe. The Wilsons moved last week. The Garcias are talking about it.” Her voice broke. “It’s like he’s stealing our lives.”We moved a month later, to a city hours away, a place with tall buildings and busy streets, far from quiet suburbs. The attacks in Sacramento continued, spreading to other towns. Years later, I read he started killing—couples, just like us, murdered in their beds with those same shoelaces. They called him the Golden State Killer. They didn’t catch him until 2018, 40 years after that summer. I still check my locks every night, sometimes twice. I still hear those footsteps in my dreams, crunching on gravel, circling closer, and I wake up with my heart racing, wondering if he’s still out there, watching.

  


# ""A Quiet Town, A Dark Secret"":

I was 14 in 1987, living in Dubuque, Iowa, where the streets were lined with tidy houses and kids played kickball in cul-de-sacs until the streetlights flickered on. It was the kind of place where you left your bike on the lawn and didn’t worry about it being gone in the morning. Our neighborhood felt safe, boring even, until that fall when everything changed. Kenny Joe Johnson, a kid in my class, was part of it all, and what happened to him still creeps into my thoughts, especially at night when the house is too quiet.It was a Thursday in October, and I was in history class at Roosevelt Middle School. Kenny Joe sat two rows over, his lanky frame hunched over his desk. He had brown eyes that always seemed to look somewhere else, and a shy smile that came out when you least expected it. He wasn’t one of the loud kids who joked around or got invited to birthday parties. He lived at Hillcrest, the group home a few miles away, and that made him different. Kids didn’t pick on him much, but they didn’t talk to him either. That day, he was scribbling in his notebook, ignoring Mr. Smith’s lecture about the Civil War.“Kenny Joe, put that away and focus,” Mr. Smith said, his voice sharp but not mean. He adjusted his glasses, waiting.Kenny Joe’s head snapped up, his cheeks turning pink. “I’m listening,” he mumbled, his pencil still moving across the page.Mr. Smith sighed and walked over, his shoes clicking on the tile floor. He snatched the notebook and tossed it onto his desk with a thud. “See me after class,” he said, pointing a finger. The room went quiet, everyone staring.Kenny Joe slumped lower in his seat, his shoulders curling in like he wanted to disappear. I felt a pang in my chest, like I should say something, maybe tell Mr. Smith to ease up. But I didn’t. I just stared at my own notes, pretending to care about Gettysburg. When the bell rang, Kenny Joe grabbed his worn-out backpack, shot Mr. Smith a look, and stormed out without a word. I watched him go, his sneakers squeaking down the hall, and something about it stuck with me. I didn’t know it was the last time I’d see him.At lunch, I sat with my friend Lisa at our usual table by the cafeteria windows. She was picking at her tater tots, talking about some new cassette she got. I couldn’t stop thinking about Kenny Joe. “He got in trouble in history,” I said, pushing my sandwich around my tray. “Looked pretty mad when he left.”Lisa shrugged, popping a tater tot in her mouth. “He’s always doing that. Probably just went back to Hillcrest. He’s run off before, you know.” She said it so casually, like it was no big deal. Kenny Joe had disappeared for a day or two before, always turning up back at the group home. I nodded, but a knot formed in my stomach. Something felt off, like a song stuck in your head but you can’t place the tune.Friday came, and Kenny Joe wasn’t at school. I figured he was suspended or maybe sick. Kids whispered in the halls, but it was just gossip, nothing serious. “Heard he got in a fight with Mr. Smith,” one kid said. Another swore they saw him hitchhiking near the highway. I didn’t believe that one—Kenny Joe wasn’t the type to stick out his thumb for a ride. By the end of the day, I pushed it out of my mind. He’d be back, I told myself.That weekend, everything fell apart. I was in the kitchen Saturday morning, sneaking a second bowl of cereal, when the phone rang. My mom answered, and I heard her voice change, sharp and low. “What do you mean, a body?” she said, gripping the receiver. I froze, the spoon halfway to my mouth, milk dripping onto the table. “In Maus Park? Are you sure?”She hung up and turned to me, her face pale, her hands shaking just a little. “There’s been a murder,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “They found a body in Maus Park. It’s a kid from your school.”My heart thudded in my chest. “Who?” I asked, though that knot in my stomach was back, tighter than ever.“They’re not saying yet,” Mom said, folding her arms like she was trying to hold herself together. “But you’re staying inside until we know more. No arguments.”Maus Park was just a few blocks from our house, a place where we’d play tag or toss a frisbee by the Mississippi River. It had a sandy beach area near the floodgate, where kids would skip rocks or dare each other to wade in. The idea of a body there, of a murder, didn’t fit. It was like hearing a scream in the middle of a lullaby.Monday morning, school was a mess. The halls buzzed with nervous energy, kids clumping together, whispering. By first period, the principal came over the intercom, her voice tight. “We have tragic news,” she said. “One of our students, Kenny Joe Johnson, was found dead this weekend. Counselors are available if you need to talk.” She didn’t say how he died, but the rumors were already spreading, each one worse than the last.At lunch, Lisa slid into the seat across from me, her eyes wide. “Did you hear?” she said, leaning in. “They found him Saturday morning, wrapped in a carpet by the floodgate. Some guy walking his dog saw it and called the cops. They’re saying he was… you know, assaulted. And strangled.”I stared at my tray, my throat tight. “That’s awful,” I managed. “I saw him Thursday, Lisa. He was right there in class, just… drawing.”She shook her head, her ponytail bouncing. “It’s so creepy. Like, who would do that? They’re saying it might be someone from around here. Someone we know.”“Don’t say that,” I said, sharper than I meant. But her words dug into me, like a splinter I couldn’t pull out. I kept picturing Kenny Joe’s face, that shy smile, and now he was gone, his body left like trash in a place we all knew.That afternoon, I saw Mr. Smith in the hall. He looked wrecked, his tie loose, his eyes red like he’d been crying. I don’t know why, but I stopped him. “Mr. Smith,” I said, my voice small, “I’m really sorry about Kenny Joe.”He looked at me, his face crumpling. “Thank you, Alex,” he said, his voice rough. “It’s just… I can’t believe it. He was just a kid.”“Did he say anything Thursday?” I asked. “After class, I mean. Did he seem okay?”Mr. Smith rubbed his face, like he was trying to wipe away the memory. “He was upset. I told him to go to the principal’s office, but he grabbed his bag and walked out. I thought he’d cool off, maybe go back to Hillcrest. I never imagined…” He trailed off, shaking his head, and walked away, his shoulders sagging.The police showed up at school that week, their uniforms standing out against the bright posters in the halls. They pulled kids aside, anyone who knew Kenny Joe. They talked to me in the guidance counselor’s office, a cop with a notepad and a tired face. “You were in his history class Thursday?” he asked.“Yeah,” I said, my hands sweaty. “He got in trouble for drawing. He was mad when he left.”“Did he say where he was going?” the cop asked, his pen hovering.“No,” I said. “He just grabbed his stuff and walked out. He didn’t talk much anyway.”“Did you see anyone strange hanging around school? Or near the park?” he pressed.I shook my head. “No, it’s just… normal around here. Or it was.”He nodded, jotting something down, and let me go. Later, I heard they found Kenny Joe’s backpack in some bushes near Maus Park, torn and empty except for a few pencils. They said he’d run away from school Thursday after his fight with Mr. Smith, and sometime between then and Saturday morning, someone got to him. The details made my skin crawl—he’d been sexually assaulted, strangled by hand, his body wrapped in an old carpet and dumped by the river. I couldn’t stop picturing it, even though I didn’t want to.The weeks after were heavy. Parents stopped letting kids go to Maus Park. My mom made me check in every hour if I was out, and she’d wait by the window until I got home. At school, kids swapped stories, each one scarier than the last. Some said it was a drifter, a serial killer passing through. Others whispered it was someone from Hillcrest, maybe someone Kenny Joe knew. One kid swore he heard the cops were looking at a teacher, but I didn’t believe that. Still, it made me look at everyone differently.I overheard teachers in the lounge one day, their voices low. “They’ve got DNA,” one said. “Some hair, skin under his nails. But the lab can’t do much with it yet. Maybe in a few years.” That stuck with me—evidence sitting in a box, waiting, while the killer was still out there.Nights were the worst. I’d lie in bed, the glow of my clock radio casting shadows on the ceiling. I kept replaying that Thursday, Kenny Joe’s hunched shoulders, the way he stormed out. I should’ve said something, maybe asked if he was okay. Guilt ate at me, like I could’ve changed things. What if he’d stayed at school? Would he still be alive?One evening, walking home from a friend’s house, I took the long way to avoid the park. The street was quiet, just the hum of a distant lawnmower and the crunch of my sneakers on the sidewalk. I felt it then—a prickle on my neck, like eyes on me. I turned, my heart racing, but the street was empty, just neat houses and trimmed hedges. I walked faster, then ran, my backpack bouncing, until I reached my porch, slamming the door behind me. I told myself it was nothing, but I didn’t believe it.The police never caught anyone. They had 30 binders of notes, interviews, leads, but nothing added up. The case went cold, and Dubuque tried to move on. But it wasn’t the same. The park stayed empty, its swings creaking in the quiet. My mom started locking the doors at night, something she never used to do. At school, Mr. Smith was different, quieter, like part of him broke. I’d catch him staring out the classroom window, like he was looking for Kenny Joe.Years later, I still think about it. The killer could be anyone—a neighbor, someone I passed at the grocery store, someone who smiled and waved like nothing happened. The police still have those DNA samples, waiting for better technology, but no one’s been caught. Sometimes, I walk by Maus Park, and I can’t help but look at that sandy spot by the floodgate. I see Kenny Joe’s shy smile, his pencil scratching in his notebook, and I wonder if he knew what was coming. The thought chills me, like a shadow that never leaves, a reminder that even in our quiet suburb, something dark was always hiding.",1,1748604774.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

You know how everyone says to put yourself out there? Well, I did. Sort of.

I decided to take my dog to the dog park because, let’s face it, she’s the most consistent relationship I’ve got right now. There I was in my “don’t talk to me until I’ve had coffee” outfit: sweatpants, messy bun, and an oversized sweater. Basically the opposite of what you see on those dating apps.

Of course, this was the exact moment a very attractive man (maybe mid-50s) decided to strike up a conversation with me. And who started it? My dog, who ran right up to him and dropped her slobbery ball at his feet.

He smiled at me and said, “Your dog has good taste.” I smiled back, trying not to trip over my own feet as I answered something awkward like, “She’s very social. I’m… working on it.”

We ended up chatting for almost half an hour about our dogs, our jobs, and how he’s new to the area. It was easy and fun, and I realized halfway through that I hadn’t thought about my divorce or my age once.

Here’s the best part: he asked if we wanted to meet up for a walk sometime soon. He said, “I’d like to see your dog again. And you too, of course.” It was simple, sweet, and felt real.

So that’s how I learned that sometimes, you don’t need a dating app or a fancy outfit to find a little spark. Sometimes all it takes is a dog, a slobbery ball, and the willingness to say yes to a random conversation.

Wish me luck for the walk next weekend. I’m hoping to find a decent outfit by then.",63,1748604695.0,datingoverforty,14,0.98,False

Recently, fellow community member Drocowzki shared in the Telegram group that he's starting a new business under the Kendu brand umbrella, and I thought it was worth highlighting here.

**As a lot of you know Kendu is a Decentralized Brand, Real-World Impact**

Kendu isn’t just building in digital spaces. The brand is exploding in the real world too. Members of the community have launched Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy Drinks, Kendu Vodka, Kendu Nights (club promotions), and even Kendu Esports, a League of Legends team. What makes this different from every other project? It’s all permissionless. Anyone can build under the Kendu brand without needing to ask for approval. There is no centralized entity handing out licenses. This is decentralized brand ownership in action.

Now Drocowzki is joining that movement with a project called *Kendu Vendu*, a vending machine service that brings the Kendu brand into everyday spaces like offices, gyms, and local businesses.

**What’s the idea behind Kendu Vendu?**

The concept is simple: offer local businesses a vending machine stocked with drinks and snacks, including products like the Kendu Energy drinks and other upcoming Kendu-related products. Each machine can be tailored to the specific location, whether that’s healthy snacks, popular sodas, or something the business specifically requests.

But here’s where it gets interesting: Drocowzki is trying to implement where the machines will be equipped with a system where customers pay in dollars, but the back-end auto-converts the payment into $KENDU. So every transaction actually supports the Kendu ecosystem. The machines will also include QR codes linking to [Kendu.io](http://Kendu.io) and other Kendu-related content. It’s a real-world touchpoint for brand awareness, and a way for the coin to gain visibility and utility beyond crypto spaces.

https://reddit.com/link/1kz1ryl/video/r5vkjg2xkw3f1/player

**Revenue Sharing and Business Model**

Businesses that host a machine will get 15 to 30 percent of gross sales, depending on the contract. That makes it a win-win, passive income for the host, and brand exposure for Kendu.

**Getting Involved and Supporting the Project**

Machines cost between $5,000 and $7,000 (plus taxes and shipping), so each location will need to handle its own financing. Drocowzki is funding the first machine himself and plans to scale from there. He’s also working on enabling crypto payments directly on the machine, with a focus on $KENDU.

And in true community spirit, once the business is profitable, he plans to donate 5 to 10 percent of his profit margins to the Kendu treasury.

https://reddit.com/link/1kz1ryl/video/znzuhvu7lw3f1/player

PS: I also heared that Drocozwki is planning to play his Kendu brainrot 24/7 on the machines when they are in idle mode.. 👀

[AAAAA IMAGINE THIS 24\/7 AT YOUR OFFICE, BULLISH.](https://reddit.com/link/1kz1ryl/video/zvg4gqiblw3f1/player)

Still normal. Just chill.

🟡 YELLOW (Grease Lightning)

💛 Greasy? Smelly?
Might be too much fat, or your pancreas is ghosting the group chat.
If it’s chronic, get it checked. If it’s brunch-related… we forgive you.

🔴 RED (Uh-oh… or Beets?)

🚨 Could be blood.
🥗 Could be beets.
🧠 Rule of thumb: if you didn’t eat a salad that looks like a crime scene, call your doc.

⚫ BLACK (We got a problem or Pepto Bismol?)

⚠️ Black can mean bleeding way up in your system.
But if you chugged Pepto or iron pills, that’s on you.
Either way… don’t ignore this.

⚪ WHITE / CLAY (The Ghost of Poops Past)

I started with my usual grind setting of 93 clicks and water temp of 92oc. That was very acidic, not unpleasant but felt like it wasn’t balanced. I have worked my way through finer and finer grinding and increasing water temp, and got to 86 clicks and 96oc water. Whilst it’s slowly reduced the acidity and brought in some pleasant bitterness the cup is now feeling more and more watery. The taste seems to suddenly drop off a cliff after a couple seconds, instead of a gradual reduction.

I’m still new to to pour-overs but I’m confused, I would have thought finer grind and hotter water would have lead to more extraction, more mouthfeel and more bitterness, do I need to go even hotter? Grind even finer?  With the finer grind the draw down has understandably slowed. ",1,1748604077.0,pourover,3,0.67,False

1kz1o2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1kz1o2f/why_do_people_look_down_on_starbucks_as_not_real/,Why Do People Look Down on Starbucks as “Not Real Coffee”?,"I’ve noticed that mentioning Starbucks in coffee discussions often invites skepticism or outright dismissal. It’s puzzling because, for many of us, Starbucks was the gateway into the world of coffee.

I’ve have visited Starbucks Reserve locations in Mumbai and Tokyo, and both experiences were exceptional. The Mumbai Reserve offered a rich, immersive coffee journey, while the Tokyo Roastery was a four-story marvel, blending Japanese craftsmanship with coffee artistry.

Starbucks sources 100% Arabica beans from Latin America and the Asia Pacific, crafting a consistent espresso blend with notes of molasses and caramel. Their Reserve line goes further—highlighting rare, small-lot coffees with a strong emphasis on origin and flavor nuance. That’s not “fake” coffee by any means.

Many also overlook that Starbucks has made high-quality coffee accessible at scale. That’s not easy. And the fact that their stores serve as second homes or workspaces for millions globally adds another dimension—it’s not just about what’s in the cup, but the culture that’s built around it.

Yes, some of the drinks are sweet and indulgent. But so what? That doesn’t disqualify the rest of their offerings. They still serve espresso, pour-over, cold brew, and even siphon at their Reserve stores. And let’s be honest—if you’ve never tried a straight Starbucks espresso, can you really comment on its quality?

So, why the disdain? Is it the brand’s popularity, its accessibility, or some perceived lack of “purity”? Can coffee not be both serious and accessible?

Would love to hear your thoughts.

I wanted to share a quick story that might hit home if you’re starting something online — whether it’s a small business, blog, product, or even just an idea you're passionate about.

A few months back, I helped a friend who was launching his first side hustle. He didn’t have a website, just an Instagram page with decent engagement. I built him a clean, professional landing page that matched his brand, added a contact form, some SEO basics, and hosted it with a free subdomain. Total cost? Less than what he spends on coffee in a week.

Fast-forward to now: that simple landing page helped him look legit. It got him leads, made his project Google-searchable, and gave him the confidence to scale up. That one small decision paid off big time.

Here’s what I’m offering:

A professionally designed landing page
Free hosting with a subdomain attached
Mobile-responsive, fast-loading, and SEO-friendly
Minimal price – you won’t find better value at this quality

I’m doing this to build my portfolio, help fellow hustlers out, and make sure money isn’t a barrier for getting started.

DM me if you're serious about launching something online.
Don’t think of this as an expense — think of it as an investment in your idea. A website is often your first impression, and a great one can open doors you didn’t even know existed.

1kz1ie0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SourdoughDiscard/comments/1kz1ie0/discard_in_muffins/,Discard in muffins,"When I make sourdough my recipe calls for 2 cups of starter so my starter is usually pretty large (as starters go).  Today I needed to feed it and it's already plenty big, and I don't feel like baking bread. But I do need to make fiber muffin bars.

I used 1.5c of starter plus 1/2 c water in place of 1 c water and 1 c flour today and it worked amazingly well. These fiber bars have a cup of psyllium husk powder in them, just one is the equivalent of a full serving of Metamucil but without the gag factor. Normally they are pretty dense, even with baking soda and baking powder. But the acidic starter reacted with the baking soda and POOF the batter was fluffy as heck. 

Modified recipe (makes 16 bars, a 9*13 pan)

Preheat to 350F, line a pan with parchment paper.

Dry stuff:
1 cup psyllium husk
1 cup sugar (orig recipe calls for 1.5c)
1 tsp baking soda 
1 tsp baking powder 
1 rounded teaspoon cinnamon 
1 rounded teaspoon ginger
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg 
3/4 cup diced candied ginger (or other dried fruit, or chopped nuts)

Wet stuff:
1.5 cups discard
1/2 c water 
1/2 c oil
2 eggs

Use a whisk to mix the dry stuff in one bowl.

Use a whisk to combine the wet stuff thoroughly.

Pour wet stuff into dry, mix with spatula, and pour/spread into the pan.  You can sprinkle sparkle sugar on top to make them pretty if desired. 

Bake 20 min on convection.  Cut into 16 pieces.  Eat ONE per day. Do not eat two. Have plenty of water with it (or tea or coffee).  I mean, if you want to try two just do it after you have seen the effectiveness of one. 

Other additions I have tried:
Molasses (1/4 cup) makes them taste like a hermit cookie.  Or use brown sugar instead of white. 

Dried orange peel and a pinch of cardamom makes them taste Christmassy (also adding craisins and pecans helps).

Cocoa is not a good idea, it tastes very bad mixed with psyllium. Big fail. Flaked coconut also didn't work for me, the psyllium has a nutty flavor like whole wheat and it just clashed with pineapple. 

Butter instead of oil didn't do anything to warrant the extra cost. ",1,1748603407.0,SourdoughDiscard,0,1.0,False

Is it wrong to expect the basics from him?,"When we’re around other people—family or friends—my husband is kind, helpful, and thoughtful. He’ll make coffee, change the baby’s diaper, do all the right things without being asked. But the moment we’re alone, he becomes the complete opposite—detached, unkind, and lacking basic compassion.

An example: when our moms visit, he jumps in to help with everything. But as soon as they leave, it’s back to “you do it” or “no one’s watching me now.” It feels like it’s all just for show.

We’ve been married for 3 years now. When I confide in close friends about how we fight—how he bangs doors, throws things—they don’t believe me. They say he seems too calm and sweet to ever do that. But that’s not the version I live with.

There are no shared goals in our marriage. Every time I bring something up—like recently buying a house because our rent is way too high—he’ll be excited at first, but then suddenly shuts down and accuses me of rushing him. It’s like any form of planning or responsibility makes him uncomfortable.

We dated for a year before marriage. Back then, money was never a big discussion—sometimes he paid, sometimes I did. But within a month of marriage, he insisted everything must be 50-50. Not proportionate to income, just straight half. He earns more than I do, but refuses to adjust. It’s starting to feel like I’m living with a roommate, not a partner—split everything, co-exist, and no emotional or life direction.

Am I wrong for expecting the basics—kindness, shared goals, emotional support—from a partner? I’m starting to question myself.

Chapter 1  
  
After seven years of secret relationship with my boyfriend Hudson, on the day we went public, his first love sent over her kidney failure medical report.  
  
Without a moment's hesitation, he abandoned me and flew overseas overnight to bring her home.  
  
Even the Best Actress nomination that was rightfully mine was reassigned to his precious Melody on his orders.  
  
When I called to confront him, what I got was only his blame.  
  
""Melody is dying, Scarlett. Do you really have to be so petty about this? It's just some stupid award—you'll have plenty of other chances!""  
  
""And Melody lost a kidney because she was kidnapped while looking for me. I have to take care of her now, I can't leave her side.""  
  
""As for going public with our relationship... we'll discuss it after she recovers.""  
  
I stared at the hung-up call, finding it utterly ridiculous.  
  
He had no idea.  
  
I'd made a bet with my family.  
  
If I couldn't win Best Actress by twenty-eight, I'd have to go home for an arranged marriage.  
  
\---  
  
Tomorrow, I saw the trending headline pushed to my phone - Hudson announces longtime girlfriend is pregnant. He'd tagged Melody.  
  
Without making a scene, I opened the comments and left a simple message: ""Wishing you both a lifetime of happiness.""  
  
The next second, Hudson's call came through.  
  
His furious voice exploded in the quiet coffee shop:  
  
""Scarlett! What the hell is that supposed to mean?""  
  
""Melody has kidney failure. She just wants to keep her baby—don't I have the right to help her do that?""  
  
""Even if I went public with her, it doesn't change how I feel about you. Why did you have to leave that comment and upset her?""  
  
I looked down at the IV in the back of my hand.  
  
Yesterday during filming, I fell from a wire stunt high above the set and lost my baby.  
  
I hadn't even had the chance to tell him about it.  
  
And then I saw his announcement.  
  
My chest tightened as I unconsciously clenched my fist. ""Hudson, let's break up.""  
  
Hearing what I said, Hudson laughed incredulously, anger fueling his laughter:  
  
""Is that all you know how to do? Threaten to break up with me?""  
  
""Scarlett, you're twenty-eight now, not the twenty-one-year-old girl I first got with. Who else would want you at this point?""  
  
""Don't forget that: all these years, every opportunity you've had ALL came from me.""  
  
""It's not like I'm dumping you. I'm just asking you to be patient until Melody has the baby. Then we can get married. You haven't lost anything. What exactly are you complaining about?""  
  
For seven years of our relationship, everyone in his circle knew I'm his back-burner girl, the one who'd been with him since I was twenty-one.  
  
He wanted me to be obedient and well-behaved, but I was always rebellious, always challenging him.  
  
At first, Hudson found my strong personality refreshing.  
  
But now...  
  
Seeing my continued silence, his patience finally snapped: ""You're the one who said you wanted to break up. Fine. This time I'll give you what you want. We're done! But I guarantee within twelve hours, you'll be begging me to take you back!""  
  
In the background, I heard Melody crying from a nightmare before he abruptly hung up.  
  
I pulled the IV out of my arm, grabbed my clothes, and walked out of the hospital.  
  
Then I dialed a number I hadn't called in years.  
  
""Alexander, wanna get married?""  
  
Then I heard the sound of tires screeching, like he'd swerved off a racetrack and hit a wall.  
  
After some rustling, his breathless voice came through:  
  
""Hell yes! I'd risk my life for this. I'm flying back home right now to marry you. Scarlett, I've waited eight years—try playing me again and see what happens!""  
  
I took a deep breath, fighting back tears.  
  
""Anyone who doesn't show up is a goddamn coward.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Hudson's influence in LA's entertainment industry was absolute.  
  
Within minutes, he'd stripped away every project I had lined up.  
  
Even the advertising contracts I'd already signed were swiftly redirected to Melody.  
  
Now headlines portrayed me as the villain who'd destroyed Hudson and Melody's ""seven-year relationship.""  
  
Seven years ago, I'd fled to Los Angeles to escape an arranged marriage. Alone and naive, I nearly fell into an escort trap when Hudson rescued me.  
  
His name alone made industry titans tremble.  
  
And now, that same power was being weaponized against me.  
  
I was packing my suitcase when my agent's text came through.  
  
She revealed Hudson had bet his friends I'd come crawling back within thirty minutes.  
  
Her final message was clear: ""Scarlett, cross Hudson and you'll never work in this town again.""  
  
I stood frozen, staring at the collection of expensive gifts he'd given me over the years.  
  
Perfect timing to return everything and make a clean break.  
  
""Send me the address,"" I replied.  
  
At the exclusive club, I heard Melody's soft voice through the door: ""Hudson, the smoke is bothering me. Maybe I should step out?""  
  
Then came the sound of glass shattering against someone's skull.  
  
Hudson's voice thundered: ""Put out your fucking cigarettes! Don't you know my child can't be around this shit?""  
  
I used to attend these industry gatherings with him.  
  
And I was allergic to cigarette smoke. At first, he'd demand everyone extinguish their cigarettes, just like now.  
  
But eventually, his patience wore thin.  
  
""Scarlett, this is the entertainment business—stop being so delicate. These are important connections. Just endure it a little longer. Don't ruin the mood.""  
  
He knew perfectly well that smoke exposure left me coughing through the night, but he still expected me to suffer through it.  
  
Yet for Melody, he'd assault a longtime business partner without hesitation.  
  
Blinking back tears, I pushed the door open.  
  
The room erupted with mocking laughter.  
  
""Look who couldn't stay away from Hudson after all!""  
  
""What's the point of being a star? Being Hudson's woman is the real achievement!""  
  
Hudson's irritation instantly transformed into smug satisfaction. His lips curled coldly as he checked his watch: ""Twenty minutes. So much for your dignity, Scarlett.""  
  
""Melody's been upset all day because of your little comment. Apologize to her and we'll forget this happened. I won't make things difficult.""  
  
Their eyes held nothing but mockery and pity.  
  
To them, my career was merely the product of Hudson's influence and money.  
  
What none of them knew was that two years ago, when Hudson faced total ruin, I was the one who signed a high-risk contract that saved Hudson Enterprises from collapse.  
  
Seven years.  
  
It took seven years to finally see that Hudson never truly loved me.  
  
How else could he miss my ghostly pallor and the bleeding wound where I'd ripped out my IV?  
  
Numbly, I dumped all his gifts onto the table.  
  
""Everything you've given me over seven years. I'm returning it all.""  
  
""From today, we're even.""  
  
The room suddenly fell deathly silent.  
  
Hudson's cold stare didn't waver, though his knuckles whitened around his whiskey glass.  
  
""You think walking away is that simple? Don't forget your contract is still mine. Leave now and you'll owe me a billion in damages. You're an orphan with no family—where would you find that kind of money?""  
  
When we started dating, I'd hidden my real identity to prevent my family from finding me, so I told Hudson I was an orphan.  
  
This had always been his weakness, his reason to protect me.  
  
Now it was just another weapon against me.  
  
My chest constricted as I looked down at the bracelet on my wrist.  
  
Hudson gave it to me seven years ago, saying wearing it meant I belonged to him.  
  
The bracelet had grown tighter over the years.  
  
Yet we had drifted further apart.  
  
Hudson sensed my intention and lurched forward.  
  
His voice quavered: ""Scarlett, don't you dare.""  
  
Just as his words fell, I snapped the jade bracelet off my wrist and tossed it onto the pile of returned gifts.  
  
""I'll pay the billion. The seven years of my youth—I admit defeat.""  
  
Hudson moved toward my bleeding wrist, but Melody grabbed him.  
  
""Hudson, there's so much blood. I'm scared—""  
  
Before finishing, she collapsed.  
  
Hudson scooped her up, frantically ordering everyone out of his way.  
  
I turned to leave—but in an instant, he seized my injured wrist, the pain so sharp it felt like my bones might shatter.  
  
""You're not going anywhere. Melody has anemia and you share her blood type.""  
  
He dragged me forcibly into the car with them and sped to the hospital.  
  
When the doctor announced Melody had hereditary Mediterranean anemia requiring a specific blood type transfusion, Hudson immediately shoved me forward and coldly stated:  
  
""Take her blood. She's Rh negative.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
My heart turned to ice, compeletely.  
  
Hudson erupted at my silence: ""Melody has no family. She's in critical condition! Would it kill you to donate some blood?""  
  
Then I just took a deep breath, my voice barely audible. ""Hudson, I had a miscarriage two days ago. The baby was yours. I can't donate blood right now.""  
  
He laughed – actually laughed – in disbelief.  
  
""Is your jealousy really that extreme? You'd invent such a disgusting lie just to avoid helping Melody?""  
  
His eyes narrowed. ""Donate the blood now, and I'll tear up the billion-dollar contract!""  
  
So that's what my life was worth to him. One billion.  
  
He only saw Melody fainting from anemia but couldn't see that I too was a mother who had just lost a child. The room spun, and I clutched the wall to stay upright.  
  
A nurse burst from the emergency room, panic etched across her face.  
  
""The patient has severe anemia! We need a transfusion immediately, or we'll lose both mother and child!""  
  
The doctor's face fell. ""What do we do? We just treated a celebrity for a miscarriage today—our blood bank is depleted. Even expedited transfers from other hospitals won't arrive until afternoon!""  
  
Hudson's voice sliced through the air. ""You're putting on quite a show over donating a little blood. Melody faints, so you have to faint too? I never realized what a fantastic actress you were, Scarlett.""  
  
Seeing I wouldn't volunteer, he forcibly grabbed my arm and dragged me toward the donation station.  
  
As I struggled against him, his words cut deeper than any needle could.  
  
""Seven years ago, I saved your life. Now you want us to be even? How exactly do you repay a life debt?""  
  
His grip tightened. ""Just behave and donate blood to Melody today. Once her baby is born, I promise I'll marry you. Melody doesn't have much time left, and in the end, that child will need you as its mother anyway.""  
  
All resistance drained from my body.  
  
The needle pierced my vein. Despite my usual terror of pain, I felt nothing as they drew two bags of blood from me.  
  
I watched Hudson's back as he anxiously followed my blood into the emergency room.  
  
My eyes burned, but no tears would come anymore.  
  
""Hudson, I've repaid what I owed you. From now on, we go our separate ways. Let's never meet again.""  
  
Later, I dragged my suitcase to a hotel, rested for a day, and booked a flight to Boston before heading to the company to terminate my contract.  
  
My agent called Hudson repeatedly.  
  
He finally answered her last call.  
  
His merciless roar exploded through the speaker: ""If she wants to leave, let her leave! Calling at a time like this—is she competing for attention?""  
  
""I asked her to donate a little blood, and she just disappeared without a word. Does she even see me as her benefactor anymore?""  
  
Seven years of love.  
  
In his eyes, just a transaction between a sugar daddy and his pet.  
  
I laughed bitterly at myself.  
  
My agent's expression morphed from concern to resentment.  
  
Now she blamed me for getting her yelled at.  
  
""I actually thought you had Hudson wrapped around your finger,"" she taunted after he hung up. ""Just days ago, he asked me for your measurements to order a wedding dress.""  
  
""But look at you now—tossed aside like garbage.""  
  
But I knew the truth.  
  
That wedding dress wasn't meant for me—it was for Melody. Our bodies were similar enough that he wanted to surprise her with it.

My agent's lips curled into a smirk. ""The contract isn't valid until Hudson signs it too. He's waiting for you at the villa.""

1kz1e7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kz1e7q/how_on_earth_do_i_end_this_relationship/,How on earth do I end this relationship.,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible - there's a bit of history for context.
I (28F) dated this guy (32M) for a few months last year. Things were wonderful and I felt like he could be a life partner. Around the 3 month mark his mom was diagnosed with cancer and our relationship fell apart. This was understandable - he takes a lot of responsibility for his family, and has done a lot in the treatment process. He didn't have capacity to see me, communication all but disappeared. I suggested we take a break so that he could focus on his family, and I could spend the time working on my anxious attachment. It hurt, but I knew he needed the space to give 100% to his mom without the burden of a new-ish relationship.

After a few months of almost no contact, I ended the relationship officially. There were a few reasons why, but ultimately his reluctance to meet up in any capacity, even talk on the phone, and finally him bailing on a critical conversation broke the camel's back. I was heartbroken and guilt ridden for months. Was it me and my anxiety? Was it him and his shutting me out? Was it just wrong timing? Did I make a hasty decision?

Fast forward and a mutual friend told me that he (ex) believed we were just on a break. It gave me hope. I reached out to reconnect and, after a month of chatting online, I managed to see him for coffee. He told me his mom was much better and that his life had stabilised - his schedule was predictable and his responsibilities had changed to mundane things like grocery shopping. He said he still loved me, and wanted to start over. I agreed, but made my needs very clear, and that if he didn't have capacity to date I would understand but I couldn't compromise.

For the next three weeks we were in different cities, but maintained contact over text. When we were finally within 10km of each other, he asked me out on a date. I was cautiously excited. Then come the day of the date, he messaged me in the morning to say his mom wasn't well and he needed to tend to her. I said no problem, I'm sorry to hear that and I hope she feels better.

A few days later I lightheartedly asked when we would be rescheduling, and his response was that he couldn't make plans, that things would need to be spontaneous because his life was so unpredictable. This was about a month after we last saw each other in person. I asked him if he really felt he had capacity to date, and his answer was non-committal: he couldn't say for sure, and we would have to take it day by day.

This was over two weeks ago. I asked if I could see him once and he wasn't available. We message daily, but no ""spontaneity"". Yet in between he is going to gym and training for his sport club (non-competitive).

The messages are still flirty and almost over familiar - the whole ""false intimacy"" thing is very real. Now I'm stuck in a place where I've had enough, I don't want to waste my time, but I still get heart emojis, cute nicknames and compliments - not to mention flirty/ dirty messages (I don't encourage them, and gently shut down anything resembling sexting). 

I know I've let this go on too long, but I wanted to give this whole day by day, spontaneous thing the time it deserved. Now I feel all the buzz words: strung along, bread crumbed, slow fade. 

How do I end this? Is it better to give it another few weeks? Or is that unfair considering my heart is out of it? I don't want to be heartless given his circumstances. 

TL/DR: my ex and I started talking again, but have landed up in exactly the same situation (a result of circumstances) that caused the break up. How do I end a seemingly endless texting relationship? ",4,1748603001.0,dating_advice,12,1.0,False

But wait – are you really safe on that public Wi-Fi? That's where a **reliable VPN** becomes your digital bodyguard.

Your Samsung Galaxy Tab isn't just a tablet; it's your portable entertainment center, work station, and personal information vault all rolled into one. Whether you're streaming content that might be geo-blocked in your region, accessing sensitive business documents, or simply wanting to browse privately, choosing the right VPN can make all the difference.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive deep into the **best VPN options** specifically optimized for Samsung Galaxy Tab devices. We've tested, analyzed, and compared the top contenders to help you make an informed decision that'll keep your digital life secure and unrestricted.

# Why Your Samsung Galaxy Tab Desperately Needs a VPN

Let's be honest – most of us don't think twice about connecting our tablets to any available Wi-Fi network. That public hotspot at the airport? Sure! The free internet at that trendy restaurant? Why not! But here's the thing: **every unsecured connection is a potential gateway for cybercriminals**.

# Privacy Protection That Actually Works

Your Samsung Galaxy Tab contains a treasure trove of personal information. From your browsing habits to saved passwords, banking apps to personal photos – it's all there. A **quality VPN encrypts your internet traffic**, making it virtually impossible for anyone to snoop on your online activities.

I learned this lesson the hard way when a friend's tablet got compromised on a hotel Wi-Fi network. One morning, she woke up to find unauthorized purchases on her credit card. That was her wake-up call, and it should be yours too.

# Unlock Global Content Libraries

Here's something that'll blow your mind: the Netflix library in South Korea has completely different shows than what's available in the United States. Same goes for other streaming platforms like Hulu, BBC iPlayer, or Amazon Prime Video. With a **geo-unblocking VPN**, your Samsung Galaxy Tab becomes a passport to global entertainment.

# Enhanced Security for Business Users

If you use your Galaxy Tab for work, you're probably accessing company networks, cloud storage, and sensitive documents. A VPN creates a **secure tunnel** between your device and your company's servers, protecting confidential information from potential threats.

# Top 5 Best VPNs for Samsung Galaxy Tab in 2025

After extensive testing on various Samsung Galaxy Tab models, here are our top recommendations:

|VPN Service|Monthly Price|Key Features|Galaxy Tab Rating|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**ExpressVPN**|$12.95|Lightning-fast speeds, 160+ locations|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**NordVPN**|$11.99|Advanced security, 6000+ servers|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**Surfshark**|$12.95|Unlimited devices, excellent value|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**CyberGhost**|$12.99|User-friendly, optimized servers|⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**Private Internet Access**|$11.95|Highly customizable, strong privacy|⭐⭐⭐⭐|

# 1. ExpressVPN: The Speed Champion

**ExpressVPN** consistently ranks as the **fastest VPN** for Samsung Galaxy Tab users, and for good reason. During our tests, it maintained over 85% of the original internet speed even when connected to servers halfway across the globe.

**What makes it special:**

* **MediaStreamer technology** that works seamlessly with Galaxy Tab
* Over 3,000 servers in 160+ locations worldwide
* **24/7 live chat support** that actually knows what they're talking about
* 30-day money-back guarantee

The app interface is incredibly intuitive on Samsung tablets. You literally just tap a button and you're connected – no complicated setup required. However, it's definitely the **priciest option** on our list, with the annual plan starting at $8.32/month.

# 2. NordVPN: The Security Fortress

If security is your top priority, **NordVPN** is your best friend. This provider offers **double VPN encryption**, which routes your traffic through two different servers for maximum protection.

**Standout features:**

* **CyberSec technology** that blocks ads and malicious websites
* Specialty servers for different needs (P2P, streaming, etc.)
* **Kill switch** that immediately cuts internet if VPN disconnects
* Works with Samsung's split-tunneling feature

NordVPN's Android app feels like it was specifically designed for tablets. The server map is gorgeous and easy to navigate on the Galaxy Tab's larger screen. At $3.59/month for the two-year plan, it offers excellent value for premium security.

# 3. Surfshark: The Budget-Friendly Beast

Here's where things get interesting. **Surfshark** offers **unlimited simultaneous connections**, meaning you can protect your Galaxy Tab, smartphone, laptop, and your entire family's devices with a single subscription.

**Why we love it:**

* **CleanWeb feature** blocks ads, trackers, and malware
* **Whitelister** (split tunneling) lets you choose which apps use VPN
* MultiHop technology for extra security
* Starting at just $2.19/month for long-term plans

The value proposition is insane. For the price of one ExpressVPN subscription, you can protect unlimited devices. The speeds are solid, though not quite as fast as ExpressVPN, but honestly? For most Galaxy Tab users, you won't notice the difference.

# 4. CyberGhost: The Streaming Specialist

**CyberGhost** takes the guesswork out of choosing servers. Their app has **dedicated servers** specifically optimized for different streaming platforms, making it incredibly easy to access geo-blocked content on your Galaxy Tab.

**Key highlights:**

* Automatic Wi-Fi protection for public networks
* **Streaming-optimized servers** for Netflix, Hulu, etc.
* 45-day money-back guarantee (longest in the industry)
* One-click connect for beginners

The interface might look a bit cartoonish, but don't let that fool you. Under the hood, it's running serious security protocols that'll keep your Galaxy Tab safe.

# 5. Private Internet Access: The Customization King

**PIA** is perfect for users who want complete control over their VPN experience. The level of customization available in their Galaxy Tab app is honestly overwhelming – in the best possible way.

**Notable features:**

* **MACE technology** blocks ads, trackers, and malware
* Extensive protocol support (OpenVPN, WireGuard, etc.)
* **No-logs policy** verified by independent audits
* Over 35,000 servers worldwide

If you're the type of person who loves tweaking settings and optimizing performance, PIA will be your playground. However, if you want something simple and straightforward, you might find it a bit too complex.

# How to Set Up a VPN on Your Samsung Galaxy Tab

Setting up a VPN on your Galaxy Tab is surprisingly straightforward. Here's the **step-by-step process** that works for all major VPN providers:

# Method 1: Using the Official App (Recommended)

1. **Open Google Play Store** on your Galaxy Tab

4. Launch the app and **create an account** or log in
5. Follow the setup wizard – most apps will **automatically configure** everything
6. Tap the connect button and you're protected!

2. Tap **""Add VPN profile""**

**Pro tip:** Most VPN providers offer detailed setup guides specifically for Samsung devices on their websites. Don't hesitate to use them!

# Essential Features to Look For in a Galaxy Tab VPN

Not all VPNs are created equal, especially when it comes to tablet usage. Here are the **must-have features** for Samsung Galaxy Tab users:

# Battery Optimization

Your Galaxy Tab's battery life is precious. Look for VPNs that use **efficient protocols** like WireGuard, which consume less power than older alternatives like OpenVPN.

# Split Tunneling Support

Samsung's **split tunneling feature** lets you choose which apps use the VPN and which connect directly. This is perfect for accessing local services while keeping sensitive apps protected.

# Kill Switch Protection

If your VPN connection drops, a **kill switch** immediately cuts your internet connection, preventing data leaks. This feature is non-negotiable for serious privacy protection.

# Large Server Network

More servers mean better performance and more options for geo-unblocking. Look for providers with at least 1,000+ servers across multiple countries.

# Troubleshooting Common VPN Issues on Galaxy Tab

Even the best VPNs occasionally have hiccups. Here are quick solutions to common problems:

**Slow Connection Speeds:**

* Try connecting to a **different server location**
* Switch to the WireGuard protocol if available
* Close unnecessary background apps

**Can't Access Streaming Content:**

* Connect to a server in the **content's home country**
* Clear your browser cache and cookies
* Try using incognito/private browsing mode

**VPN Won't Connect:**

* Check your internet connection first
* **Restart the VPN app**
* Try switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data

# Making the Right Choice for Your Galaxy Tab

Choosing the perfect VPN for your Samsung Galaxy Tab ultimately depends on your specific needs and budget. If you prioritize **speed and reliability** above all else, ExpressVPN is worth the premium price. For the best **security features**, NordVPN takes the crown. But if you want **maximum value** and plan to protect multiple devices, Surfshark is unbeatable.

Chapter 1  
  
After Landon Carter's childhood sweetheart Savannah Blake caused a drunk driving accident, he begged me to go to prison for her.  
  
""Savannah's father once saved my life, Sierra. Can’t you just do this one thing for me? I swear, the moment you’re out, I’ll marry you.""  
  
I nodded through my tears, but what was supposed to be a two-month sentence turned into six years.  
  
When I tried to recant my confession, I was met with brutal beatings.  
  
""Someone out there told us to keep you on a fucking leash. Who the hell do you think you are? Take a hard look in the mirror before you even think about laying your filthy hands on Mr. Carter!""  
  
They beat me until my eyes were bloodshot. As I lost consciousness, the last thing I saw was the TV screen showing Landon Carter embracing his childhood sweetheart Savannah Blake at their engagement party.  
  
My heart turned to ash. After six grueling years that felt like a lifetime, I was finally released.  
  
But as I quietly boarded the train with my luggage, Landon Carter's assistant appeared before me with a respectful bow.  
  
""Miss Jameson, Mr. Carter would like to see you.""  
  
\---  
  
I sat in the car watching the city rush past in reverse. Six years had transformed New York City beyond recognition. The car drove past a towering skyscraper with a giant billboard broadcasting the news: ""NYC's wealthiest bachelor Landon Carter purchases nine figures on a necklace for his new girlfriend as the couple enters their luxury mansion together.""  
  
Nine figures. I counted slowly in my dulled mind.  
  
I looked down at the beaded bracelet on my wrist that he'd bought me six years ago. Two dollars, though the cord had long since faded and frayed.  
  
I gently untied it and tossed it out the window without a second thought..  
  
We'd arrived at a mansion, before I knew it. And Lost in thought, I barely noticed the assistant handing me a phone.  
  
Landon Carter's deep, pleasant voice came through the line.  
  
""Sierra, I'm tied up with something right now. Wait for me at the house, okay?""  
  
I listened quietly, waiting three seconds after he finished before slowly responding with a soft ""mm-hmm.""  
  
Landon paused, seemingly puzzled by my response.  
  
Six years had made me much quieter. I was no longer the girl who used to chatter away at him endlessly.  
  
After he hung up, I sat in the mansion waiting. The housekeeping staff exchanged glances and whispered behind my back.  
  
""Looks like Mr. Carter brought home another one. This one’s all bones and not even that cute.""  
  
""I heard she just got out of prison.""  
  
""Oh my God, what a disaster. Mr. Carter's taste is getting weird. At least before it was actresses, models, socialites... but this one is just...""  
  
They sighed dramatically, as if feeling sorry for Landon Carter.  
  
I didn't really care, but I couldn't stop checking my watch. It had been seven hours since Landon said he'd be ""a while.""  
  
I hadn't eaten since leaving prison, and with the air conditioning blasting, I was both cold and starving.  
  
Finally, I asked the butler where Landon was. After just two questions, he gave me this annoyed look—like I was just one of those girls constantly throwing themselves at Landon.  
  
""Mr. Carter is with Miss Blake right now. They're watching fireworks on his yacht. He doesn't have time for you.""  
  
Savannah Blake. Her name flashed through my mind.  
  
Six years ago, she drove drunk and seriously injured two pedestrians.  
  
I was the one who went to prison in her place.  
  
That's how I went from being Sierra Jameson, the beloved daughter of the Jameson family, to a despised criminal.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Meanwhile, she transformed herself from a girl from the projects into a golden phoenix, spoiled by Landon Carter like a princess.  
  
But I didn't care anymore.  
  
After my family went bankrupt and my parents couldn't handle the shame and killed themselves, nothing could stir even the slightest emotion in my heart.  
  
Except for the two things Landon had promised me before I went to prison.  
  
First, that he would marry me.  
  
Second, that he would get back my family's turquoise heirloom bracelet.  
  
Now I didn't want to get married anymore. My only wish was to get back that heirloom.  
  
Lost in thought, the gnawing pain in my stomach grew more vicious. I clutched my stomach and walked to the kitchen.  
  
When I tried to make something for myself, a housekeeper rudely slapped my hand away.  
  
""Don't touch anything. Mr. Carter and Miss Blake don’t want some outsider messing around in their kitchen.""  
  
""Just wait it out.""  
  
She rolled her eyes at me and walked away.  
  
After another three hours, Landon still hadn't returned. I collapsed on the couch, everything went black, and I passed out completely.  
  
When I woke up, I was lying in bed with an IV drip. A doctor had been called.  
  
Landon had his back to me, scolding the housekeepers.  
  
""Are you fucking stupid? She’s starving and not one of you thought to make her a damn meal?""  
  
""Next time this shit happens, you're all fired!""  
  
Savannah Blake walked in at the sound. ""Landon, don't angry. Come have some coffee.""  
  
She pulled him out of the room.  
  
The housekeepers looked at each other with pale faces.  
  
""That scared me. Mr. Carter hasn't been that angry in ages.""  
  
""It's all her fault! Acting all pitiful and getting us yelled at!""  
  
""Don’t get cocky—she’ll be gone in two months anyway.""  
  
They hurried away.  
  
I removed the IV needle and slowly walked out.  
  
The first person to see me was one of Landon's friends. He obviously didn't know who I was and asked curiously:  
  
""Landon, is this a new housekeeper? Why is she coming out of your bedroom?""  
  
Landon spun around, and when our eyes met, his pupils visibly contracted.  
  
After six years apart, he was still as elegant and handsome as ever.  
  
But I looked like a weary traveler at the end of her journey, my face etched with exhaustion and hardship.  
  
Savannah laughed lightly and gracefully walked over. Playing the role of lady of the house, she said to the man in the gray suit:  
  
""Reed, this is... a relative of Landon's from his hometown. Not a housekeeper.""  
  
I looked at Landon. He watched me silently without contradicting her.  
  
I guess he really was too embarrassed to be associated with me now.  
  
Which made sense. I was just an ex-con now, and it had been six years since our engagement. Things had changed.  
  
During the awkward silence, the chef finished preparing dinner.  
  
After we sat down, they started talking about recent events. I couldn't follow any of it, so I focused on eating.  
  
But suddenly, Reed Collins said with surprise:  
  
""Oh man, your ex from prison’s probably getting out soon, huh?""  
  
""Whatever, just throw her some cash and make sure she stays the hell away.""  
  
Instantly, the lively dinner table fell silent.  
  
Savannah glanced at me casually, her mocking smile clearly visible.  
  
Landon kept his expression steady and didn't respond.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Reed sensed something was off and was about to say something when I suddenly smiled and said calmly, ""She won't.""  
  
Reed looked curious and turned to ask why.  
  
I slowly swallowed my food, but before I could open my mouth, Landon interrupted in a low voice.  
  
""Enough. Just eat.""  
  
He stared at me intently, his eyes churning with dark emotions.  
  
I kept my head down and continued eating, unmoved.  
  
After dinner, as Reed was leaving, he noticed the piano in the living room and commented admiringly:  
  
""Wow, nice piano. Who’d you buy that for?""  
  
Savannah gracefully sat down and began playing smoothly.  
  
After finishing the piece, she looked at the admiration in Reed's eyes and said modestly:  
  
""I only started learning piano recently, but my teacher says I’ve got real talent—better than people who’ve been playing for like ten years.""  
  
She shot me a look while saying it—yeah, that was definitely aimed at me.  
  
I had learned piano, violin, and traditional instruments since childhood, with piano being my strongest. I'd even performed at a prestigious concert hall as an adult.  
  
Savannah had always been jealous when she found out, constantly saying that if she'd had money for lessons, she would have been better than me.  
  
Now, after six years in prison, she assumed I'd gotten rusty.  
  
So she smiled sweetly at me. ""Sierra, I heard you studied for a long time. Why don't you play something for us?""  
  
Landon frowned, seeming like he wanted to stop me.  
  
But my fingers were already on the keys.  
  
The next second, a rich, rhythmic melody flowed naturally from the piano.  
  
Compared to Savannah's beginner-level playing, the difference was immediately obvious.  
  
Landon and Reed both looked impressed. When I finished, they both applauded.  
  
Savannah's face turned green with rage as she glared at me.  
  
Reed walked over to me, his tone taking on a serious note:  
  
""That was amazing—I didn’t know you were that good. I actually have a concert grand at my place. Would you like to come by and play it.""  
  
I opened my mouth but hadn't answered yet when Landon suddenly spoke up: ""It's getting late. You should head out. And remember to take Savannah home.""  
  
Reed looked at me with some regret and left with Savannah, who kept looking back over her shoulder.  
  
The spacious living room was left with just Landon and me.  
  
I hunched my shoulders. The air conditioning was on full blast, but his expression was even colder than the air.  
  
Landon grabbed my wrist.  
  
His tone was nasty, almost cruel: ""Sierra Jameson, flirting around the minute you get out. Do you have any dignity left as a woman?""  
  
I didn't react much to his words, just gave a faint twist of my lips.  
  
What dignity did I have left as a woman? I'd lost nearly twenty pounds.  
  
The youthful vitality was gone from my face.  
  
Seeing me stay silent, he looked stunned. I used to love arguing with him.  
  
But now, looking at my almost lifeless expression, his heart suddenly felt like it was being stabbed with needles.  
  
His tone suddenly softened: ""I didn’t mean it like that.""  
  
""I'll make this right for you, just not now. Our marriage still stands.""  
  
When he mentioned marriage, his voice suddenly paused.  
  
He said slowly, ""I’ll make it up to you, just… not right now. And our marriage? That still counts.""  
  
Landon stared intently at my expression, as if my earlier answer really mattered to him.

1kz17o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1kz17o8/is_the_bose_quietcomfort_wireless_noise/,Is the Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones Worth It? A Bad Reviewers Analysis,"**Last month, my ancient noise-cancelling headphones finally gave up during a particularly turbulent cross-country flight, leaving me defenseless against crying babies and chatty passengers.** Desperate for replacement **best noise cancelling headphones 2025** that could handle my frequent travel schedule, I reluctantly opened my wallet for these [Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones review](https://amzn.to/43kcAkB) candidates, wondering if the legendary Bose noise cancellation could justify nearly $200 of my hard-earned freelancer budget. After eight weeks of daily use through airport chaos, coffee shop distractions, and late-night gaming sessions, I'm ready to share whether these **wireless ANC headphones** live up to their premium reputation or just represent expensive marketing hype.

# Comfort & Fit

The [Bose QuietComfort](https://amzn.to/43kcAkB) absolutely nails the comfort equation that so many **premium wireless headphones** get embarrassingly wrong. The memory foam ear cushions feel like tiny pillows that somehow maintain their plushness even after 6+ hour marathon sessions, and the headband padding distributes weight so evenly that you genuinely forget you're wearing them. At 240g, these feel substantial enough to justify premium pricing without causing neck fatigue during transcontinental flights.

The over-ear design creates excellent passive isolation even with ANC disabled, and the ear cups accommodate glasses comfortably without creating pressure points that plague other premium models. However, the cushions do run slightly warm during summer months or intense workouts – these definitely lean toward office comfort rather than gym performance for **best Bose headphones 2025** considerations.

# Sound Quality & Performance

Bose delivers their signature balanced sound profile that prioritizes clarity and detail over flashy bass emphasis. The **Bose QC headphones** handle everything from podcast dialogue to orchestral complexities with impressive competence, revealing subtle details in familiar tracks that cheaper alternatives completely miss. The soundstage feels spacious and natural, making these excellent for both critical listening and casual entertainment consumption.

What truly sets these apart is how the sound quality integrates with the noise cancellation – no weird frequency gaps or artificial coloring that some ANC implementations introduce. The **active noise cancellation headphones** experience feels seamless, where the silence enhancement actually improves music appreciation rather than fighting against it like some competitors.

# Battery Life & Charging

Twenty-four hours with ANC enabled delivers exactly what Bose promises, making these excellent for international travel or week-long business trips without charging anxiety. Even heavy daily use with maximum noise cancellation rarely requires more than weekly charging sessions, which feels liberating compared to daily charging routines plaguing other **wireless headphones for travel** options.

The USB-C charging reaches 80% capacity in roughly 2 hours, and the quick charge feature provides 2.5 hours of playback from just 15 minutes plugged in. However, the included cable feels disappointingly short for convenient desk charging, and there's no wireless charging capability that some premium competitors now offer.

# Additional Features

The Bose Music app unlocks customization options that actually improve the listening experience rather than adding complexity for its own sake. EQ adjustments feel responsive and musical, and the customizable noise cancellation levels let you dial in exactly the right amount of isolation for different environments. The **Bose vs Sony headphones** comparison heavily favors Bose for intuitive app design that doesn't require engineering degrees to navigate.

Multipoint Bluetooth connectivity works flawlessly for switching between laptop work and smartphone calls, and the implementation feels more polished than most alternatives attempting similar functionality. The wear detection automatically pauses music when you remove the headphones, though it occasionally triggers false positives when adjusting fit.

# Specifications & Connectivity

Bluetooth 5.1 provides rock-solid connectivity with excellent range and minimal dropouts during normal use. Codec support includes SBC, AAC, and aptX, covering most high-quality streaming scenarios without the complexity of audiophile-grade protocols that most users never utilize. The [noise cancelling headphones under 200](https://amzn.to/43kcAkB) category often sacrifices connectivity reliability, but these perform flawlessly.

The foldable design with included hard case makes these surprisingly travel-friendly for full-size over-ear models. Cable management feels thoughtful, and the build quality suggests these will survive typical business travel abuse over reasonable 3-4 year lifecycles that justify premium investments.

# Controls & UI

Physical buttons combined with intuitive touch gestures create the best of both worlds for headphone control interfaces. The dedicated ANC button cycles through noise cancellation modes with satisfying tactile feedback, while touch controls on the right ear cup handle playback and volume adjustments smoothly. The **Bose QuietComfort review** experience reveals controls that actually work reliably rather than fighting user intentions.

Voice assistant integration responds quickly to wake words, and call quality through the built-in microphones exceeds expectations for business conference scenarios. The noise rejection during calls impresses colleagues who can't tell I'm working from noisy coffee shops rather than quiet home offices.

# Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

* Industry-leading noise cancellation performance
* Exceptional all-day wearing comfort
* Balanced, detailed sound quality
* Reliable 24-hour battery life
* Intuitive app and control interface

**Cons:**

* Premium pricing versus budget alternatives
* No wireless charging capability
* Ear cushions retain heat during exercise
* Short included charging cable

# Value Proposition & Price Analysis

At $189.99, the [Bose QuietComfort](https://amzn.to/43kcAkB) positions itself competitively against the Sony WH-1000XM5 ($399) and Sennheiser Momentum 4 ($349) while undercutting flagship pricing significantly. Compared to the Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT2 ($199) or Anker Soundcore Life Q45 ($149), these emerge as the clear **best noise cancelling headphones 2025** value leader for users prioritizing proven ANC performance over absolute budget minimization.

This represents the **noise cancelling headphones under 200** sweet spot where premium features meet reasonable pricing. For frequent travelers, remote workers, or anyone whose productivity depends on blocking distractions, this investment delivers tangible daily benefits that justify the premium over basic wireless headphones.

# Final Verdict & Recommendation

**🔥 Would I recommend the** [Bose QuietComfort](https://amzn.to/43kcAkB) **to anyone serious about noise cancellation and audio quality? The answer is a resounding yes.**

These headphones prove that Bose's decades of noise cancellation expertise translate into real-world benefits that improve daily life rather than just impressive spec sheets. While they cost more than budget alternatives, they deliver the premium audio experience that makes the price difference disappear after your first long flight or productive work session in a noisy environment. The comfort, sound quality, and legendary noise cancellation combine into a package that justifies its position among serious audio gear.

A few hours later, the United Planets fleet of spaceships raced through the void. Inside the lead ship, a tall, muscular man in gold and white armor concealed his face under his helmet as the soldiers gathered around him. Gancelot, Orion's second in command, held a meeting of dire importance. And uneasy murmuring filled the air as the soldiers came to their leader.

""Thank you all for a swift reassembly. I called you back to clear up any miscommunication. This attack must be flawless if it is to succeed.""

""Vice-Commander Gancelot, is this attack a good idea? We're not at max fighting strength, so there's no guarantee we can break through their defenses and secure the target,"" Sarah said.

Gancelot sighed. ""We must try and do more with less. According to your intel, they could destroy the divinus anytime now. And if that happens, I don't know if we can win this war.""

""Why isn't the boss here?""

""With our forces stretched thin, Orion has departed on another mission. He is overseeing the defense of several valuable locations on the front.""

Daisy raised her hand to ask a question, and as Gancelot saw her, he signaled her to talk.

""Vice-Commander, I'm sorry, but I still don't quite understand. What exactly is the divinus, and why is it so important?""

""It is an energy source. Possibly the greatest in this or any galaxy. However, its will refuses to bend to Mavor, so he wants to destroy it.""

""It's will? You mean to say it's alive?""

""Simply put, it is the only thing that can rival Mavor's power, and that's why we must secure it at all costs.""

“W-where did it come from?”

“No one knows for certain where it came from. One day, it just did.”

“So it’s a weapon someone made one day in the past? Similar to an artificial intelligence?”

“No. It’s a force of nature. As far as we know, there was no maker. Miraculous events merely happened in its presence.”

“A force of Nature that fiend wants to dominate or destroy?”

Gancelot nodded.

“I think I understand now. Thank you.”

\*\*\*

Later, Daisy spotted Everton sitting alone in a corner and ran over to him.

""Everton, I want to apologize for what happened before.""

""There's no need to apologize, child. As I said, your kindness is a blessing to others but a curse to yourself.” Everton adjusted his seating, turning his back to Daisy. “You see no value in your life. And now I know better than to get involved with fools' errands.""

""Pa always said-""

Everton got up from his seat, turning to Daisy, seething.

""To be charitable to a suicidal degree? You'll die in the name of people you don't know."" 

""If that's how you feel, why did you join this army in the first place?""

""It was because I had a dream long ago. You humans wouldn't know, but there was a time when war was a distant memory.” Everton dropped back onto his seat, bowing his head. “I sacrificed everything for that dream. I still remember the happy days with my dear father as a child.”

Daisy held herself, trembling like in a cold breeze as she heard Everton. “I never knew you understood my pain so well.”

“Daisy, I see so much of myself in you it hurts you're like a second d-""

""A second what?""

Everton gave Daisy silence as a response, turning his gaze from her. But tired of him not listening to her, she took a deep breath, preparing to continue speaking.

""I am like you. I share your dream of a galaxy where love and kindness rule. A place where all intelligent life can enjoy freedom and lead happy lives.” Daisy stooped down, making Everton look her in the eye. “And just as you did before me, I will sacrifice everything for this dream. It's who I am.""

Everton took a deep breath and reached into his pocket. He pulled out his daughter's cushion and showed it to Daisy. ""Very well then, here's a peace offering.""

Daisy's jaw dropped as she saw the cushion.""Your daughter's pillow. I can't take it.""

""Please, indulge me.""

Daisy slowly took the cushion from his hand and held it close to her heart. 

""Thank you.""

Suddenly, alarm bells rang, and all the soldiers in the room ran off to prepare for battle. Daisy and Everton joined their comrades as they gave each other a face of determination.

\*\*\*

Later, a squadron of advanced fighters from the United Planets' fleet began the attack on the planet. 

""Vice-commander, everything looks ready. Beginning attack approach now,"" Lucas said.

The squadron, led by Lucas, kept a tight formation, entering the enemy atmosphere. But nearing the Nemesis fortress, dots of purple light peppered the battlefield as enemy turrets prepared to fire, and soon they met with a storm of plasma bolts. 

The United Planets squadron quickly scattered, taking evasive action.

""Listen, team. I'll try to draw the attention of those turrets. When you see an opening fire at will,"" Lucas said.

Lucas swiftly dived closer to the turrets like he dared death to catch him. Many of their attacks drew towards him. But he navigated through the barrage, dodging the shots. As he got close enough, he bombarded the enemy forces, firing plasma bolts and missiles at the turrets. Lucas left a fiery scar of destruction on the land, a refuge from the rest of the bolts flying through the air. It was an opening for his fellow pilots to dive closer and destroy the remaining turrets so the fleet could land.

As the blockade of bolts thinned, the remaining squadron quickly reunited into formation, beginning their attack run. The ships dived near the remaining turrets, unleashing a salvo of their guns on the enemy. Together, the squadron widened the scar Lucas left, giving the fleet the room to land.

""Vice-commander, we've cleared a path for you the best we can. You may begin your approach.""

On the lead ship, Gancelot stood with his soldiers, preparing to join Lucas on the battlefield.

*""Many thanks, Lucas.""*

The lead ship soon landed on the battlefield. Inside, Daisy stood with Everton among the United Planets soldiers. The sounds of war filled the air. Daisy scanned the many faces of her new comrades, seeing the uneasiness upon them. The soldiers were tight-lipped as sweat flowed down their faces, and their eyes fixed on the large metallic doors before them, waiting for them to open.

""Daisy, I hate to bring this up again, but-""

""You're gonna ask about the killing thing again?"" Daisy interrupted.

Everton nodded.

""I'm willing to do it now. We're still in sick times, but it's not a game anymore.""

""Good to hear.""

Daisy jumped out of her skin as she saw Sarah grow to a giant size.

Sarah saw the look of shock on Daisy's face and giggled.""Overwhelmed human?""

""I'll never lie. After this, I'll need a double helping of Ma's apple pie.""

The doors opened to the battlefield, and all the soldiers inside hurried out, led by Gancelot.

""United Planets, maximum overdrive,"" Gancelot said.

The United Planets soldiers rammed into the Nemesis forces with a fierce clash. Bodies flew over the battlefield as the two factions fought for dominance. Daisy ran into the heat of war, ready to fight. But as the killing on both sides quickly grew, she was in shock. She thought she was ready, but she wasn’t. Daisy underestimated just how deeply ingrained her values were. Daisy still viewed all life as sacred. It was a divine gift that someone should cherish as long as possible. To see such flippant disregard for its sanctity was more than abhorrent, but an existential crisis. So, she stood there watching the battle unfold, stationary and an easy target for the enemy.",1,1748602271.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

Morana hovered above Daisy and Carter, looking down on them. The two held their weapons close, wanting to attack but too cautious to make the first move. Never before had they directly faced an opponent so powerful and ruled by hate. But trading sideways glances, they ensured they had each other’s support, preparing to repel any assault. However, finally, Morana attacked. 

Morana quickly raised her hand, summoning a storm of razor-sharp icicles. They rained down with speed and range, which made dodging impossible. Still, Daisy and Carter charged forward. Daisy took refuge under her shield, but Carter slashed away the icicles with his sword.

The two jumped to Morana nearly perfectly synchronized. They prepared to strike her, but she softened the blow with an ice shield. However, she still came crashing down. Morana separated them with an ice wall, charging at Daisy as they landed. Daisy tossed her shield at her, but she dodged. As she tried to call it back, Morana trapped it in ice. 

Daisy hurriedly readied a punch, but Morana caught it, freezer-burning her hand. With Daisy in her grasp, Morana repeatedly struck her with a grin. She landed a punch, an elbow, and a knee to Daisy’s face and body repeatedly, her smile becoming wider as she became more bloody. Carter appeared behind Morana and stabbed his sword forward, going for the head. Morana saw him in the reflection on the ice wall, and she narrowly dodged. She flew far away, readying to shoot Daisy and Carter to oblivion. Still, Carter closed the distance in seconds, going for a decapitation. However, inches from the blade, Morana unleashed a wave of intense cold that made his metal sword brittle, breaking it.

Daisy, barely clinging to consciousness, watched Carter struggle. She saw Carter drop to his knees, shivering from the cold. Her mind became clear as Morana, with a sadistic grin, stabbed Carter in the stomach with an ice knife.

*""No!""* Daisy shouted.

Daisy's shield burst out of the ice, growing to a giant size. It moved toward Morana in a stream of light so fast that she couldn't defend herself. Slamming into her face, sending her flying into a wall.

As Morana rose, Daisy appeared in front of her. Morana moved to slash her with an ice sword, but Daisy caught her arm, crushing it. As she screamed, Daisy bludgeoned Morana with a storm of kicks and punches. Finally, Daisy grabbed Morana, jumping high in the air, and coming down with her in a suplex that shook the room.

As Daisy stood victorious over an unconscious Morana, an alarm rang, and feedback came from the speakers.

*""All hands, ready final safety checks for darkhold fortress. We will be fully functional in one minute.""* 

Daisy hurried to the control panel but collapsed from exhaustion. As time raced by she fought herself. Every inch she took brought excruciating pain, exasperating her injuries. As she finally stood up, she began to fall again, reaching the limits of her strength. However, Carter caught her before she hit the floor, and she shed tears seeing him, clutching the wound on his stomach but alive.

”You’re okay.” 

With seconds remaining until doomsday, the two helped each other to the control panel. Carter quickly input the code, Daisy pressed the big green button, and the power conduit hastily collapsed as multiple explosions went off.

Morana regained consciousness and looked around as the conduit collapsed. However, she quickly flew out of the room, but not without sealing the exit with ice first.

Without warning, Daisy and Carter saw a pillar of fire burst through the ceiling, and Daisy's stallion flew into the room.

*""Your horse?""* Carter shouted.

The stallion quickly flew over to them, and they jumped on, flying to safety.

Outside, Daisy and Carter flew through the air on the stallion. They saw the human soldiers escorting the slaves away from the fortress. Soon they witnessed the fortress explode, blowing away the clouds above, and revealing the beautiful blue sky for miles like an omen of glorious victory.

\*\*\*

Over the next few months, Damara and Carter led the charge against the remaining Nemesis forces. The people of Japan rejoiced as the ships left their skies. Those of the Sahara desert celebrated, seeing them expel the invaders from their land. All humanity joined the celebration, witnessing the Earth cleansed of the alien threat.

Later, in Washington, DC, people of every background gathered around a stage. Legions of eyes were on Damara as she got a medal for her heroism. Her face blushed bright red from embarrassment, and she hid behind her shield. However, she spotted Carter giving her a thumbs up, and she frowned. She still hadn’t told him her real identity and feared the consequences.

Meanwhile, on planet Nemesis, Mavor sat with his servants in his throne room. And his business partner stood by him in the shadows during an important meeting.

""Dr. Zola, is sure his scans are correct? This Damara is the vessel of the divinus?"" 

""Yes, emperor.""

Mavor signaled his servants to leave the room, and they quickly followed his orders. And he broke into a laughing fit as they went.

""Forgive my boldness, emperor, but I believe I have missed the joke.""

""The joke is that there was no telling how long it would have taken to destroy the divinus in its natural state. But now that it's flesh and blood, our goal is much closer.""

""I will circulate her picture through the empire and ensure everyone knows the kill-on-sight order is active.""

""Thank you, my old friend.""

On Earth, Daisy walked around a military base holding Everton's cushion close to her heart. She watched Carter from far away as he oversaw the training of recruits. 

Daisy hugged Everton's pillow. ""Everton, I hope you were right.""

Later, Daisy brought Carter to an oak tree far from anyone else.

""Well, we're here. So what's this about?""

*""Carter, I…can't wait anymore.""*

Daisy started kissing Carter like there was no tomorrow. She had been restraining her feelings for too long, but he pushed her away.

""I'm flattered, but I can't do this. It's not right.""

""I understand. You have a girlfriend.” Daisy took a deep breath, forcing a smile. “I hope you two are happy.""

""I had a girlfriend, but she died in a Nemesis attack.” Carter shed tears. “Her name was Daisy. I loved her more than anything.""

As Daisy heard Carter, she shed tears of joy, breaking into a laughing fit. But as Carter saw her, he shot her a glare.

*""You think this is funny?""* Carter shouted.

""No, no, I don't. Just look."" Light swiftly swallowed Daisy's body, and she emerged from it, reverting from Damara to her regular form.

Carter staggered back from Daisy as he saw her transformation. ""What type of sick game are you playing?""

""There's no game, Carter. I'm Daisy. Let me prove it.” Daisy tapped the oak tree. “On our first date, we went under an oak tree like this one. I told you about the worst day of my life, the day my Pa died. You held me tight, and we kissed for the first time.""

From the look on his face, Daisy knew he realized the truth. She was Daisy, practically revived from the dead. He hurried over, kissing her passionately, making up for their lost time apart, hugging her tight.

Daisy took out Everton's cushion and held it close to her heart. She reciprocated Carter's hug. And Daisy shed happy tears as she stood ready for the future, armed with the love of the men she held most dear.",2,1748602265.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
When Riley Bolton pushed open the VIP lounge door, she walked straight into a bunch of guys debating how brutal first love really hits you.  
  
""Alright Michele, we all spilled our guts. Your turn, bro. Don't even think about weaseling out.""  
  
Hearing that name made Riley's hand freeze on the door handle.  
  
After what felt like forever, Michele Morrone knocked back some whiskey. Then his voice cut through the room—low, rough, and soaked in alcohol.  
  
""Got her name tattooed right over my heart. Still there.""  
  
""My old leather jacket's got bloodstains from our first time. Never washed it.""  
  
""That little Riley Bolton? She's basically just filling in for the real deal.""  
  
Every single word slammed into Riley like a freight train.  
  
Her blood turned to ice. She felt like she was drowning.  
  
She was just some cheap knockoff of his first love?  
  
The room went dead quiet for a second, then exploded with whoops and hollers.  
  
""Yo, that's fucking brutal, dude!""  
  
""Jesus Christ, Michele! Three sentences and you just nuked everyone else. You're seriously messed up, man."" This came from Jake Morrison, some hotshot investment banker who thought he was God's gift to women.  
  
""Hold up though,"" chimed in Tyler Chase, a real estate mogul's son who'd never worked a day in his life.  
  
""Didn't you hear? Sharpay Evans is flying back to LA next month. Since you're still hung up on her after all these years, looks like you'll finally get your shot. But what about that girl you're stringing along now? Isn't she your sister's little friend or whatever?""  
  
Tyler let out this nasty laugh.  
  
""Dude, that chick is so pathetic. Following you around like a lost puppy for years. Does she actually think she's in your league? I mean, come on.""  
  
""She's useful enough,"" Michele said with this cold shrug, like he was talking about a piece of furniture.  
  
""Easy on the eyes, doesn't ask too many questions. Good enough for now.""  
  
""But seriously,"" Jake pressed, ""when Sharpay gets back, you're gonna dump the substitute, right? I mean, why settle for McDonald's when you can have prime steak?""  
  
The whole group cracked up at that.  
  
""Riley's sweet and all,"" Michele continued, his pilot-trained voice steady and emotionless, ""but she's just... temporary. Always has been. Kid doesn't even realize she's playing in a league way above her head.""  
  
""Your dad's gonna flip when you end up with the Evans girl though,"" Tyler smirked.  
  
""Captain Morrone marrying into that family? That's some serious old-money power couple shit right there.""  
  
Michele stayed quiet, but Riley could practically hear his indifference through the silence.  
  
Seeing someone getting up to leave, Riley's face went ghost-white as reality crashed back. She stumbled downstairs on shaky legs.  
  
Rain was absolutely dumping outside, but she walked right into it like she couldn't feel anything anymore.  
  
Freezing raindrops mixed with her tears, everything streaming down her face together.  
  
Her vision was completely blurred, her brain stuck on repeat with those devastating words as memories started flooding back.  
  
Michele Morrone was her best friend's older brother—four years older, and in a completely different universe.  
  
She first saw him during junior year at Arcadia High, when she and Nicoletta got cornered by some sketchy guys in an alley behind the school.  
  
Just when things were looking really bad, Michele showed up on his Ducati. He pulled off his helmet with these long, perfect fingers and said in this ice-cold voice, ""You idiots messing with my little sister?""  
  
The second that helmet came off and she saw his face, Riley's heart just about exploded in her chest.  
  
Nicoletta had always bragged about her ridiculously hot older brother, but seeing him in person was something else entirely. Especially watching him absolutely destroy those guys with a few perfectly placed kicks like it was nothing.  
  
Back then, every girl at Arcadia High was crushing on someone.  
  
Everyone except Riley.  
  
But that day?  
  
Game over.  
  
She fell hard for her best friend's brother.  
  
By college, when she'd finally grown into her looks, Nicoletta convinced her to actually make a move.  
  
She tried everything—homemade breakfast sandwiches, ""accidentally"" bumping into him at the country club, researching aviation stuff to have something to talk about...  
  
She threw her whole heart at it, but Michele kept treating her like some annoying kid sister, all polite distance and barely-there smiles.  
  
Though sometimes she'd catch him staring at her face with this weird, spaced-out expression.  
  
Everything changed that night when he was driving her home in his car and some drunk idiot almost T-boned them.  
  
Without even thinking, she threw herself in front of him.  
  
The other guy hit his brakes just in time.  
  
She barely got hurt—just a tiny cut by her eye from hitting the dashboard, maybe the size of a dime.  
  
It was nothing, but Michele completely lost it. He was freaking out, rushing her to Cedars-Sinai, grilling the ER doctor about whether it would scar.  
  
Only after getting the all-clear did he finally chill out.  
  
Then he started giving her this lecture with that stern pilot voice, demanding to know why she'd done something so stupid, asking if she had a death wish.  
  
Riley just looked up at him with these bright, shining eyes, her feelings written all over her face.  
  
""Because I'm in love with you.""  
  
Michele froze like someone had tasered him. Then he gave this cold, bitter laugh.  
  
""Love? You're barely eighteen. What the hell do you know about love? And how long is this little crush supposed to last?""  
  
""Forever!"" she shot back without missing a beat.  
  
""Michele Morrone, I will love you forever.""  
  
Maybe it was how sure she sounded, how completely sincere, that made Michele reach out and actually touch her face for the first time.  
  
He sighed and finally said what she'd been dying to hear: ""Riley Bolton, let's see what happens.""  
  
From that day on, they were officially together.  
  
Three years of dating.  
  
Michele was naturally cold as ice, but he gave her what she needed, and she never pushed for more.  
  
Until tonight, when that conversation completely destroyed everything she thought she knew.  
  
So those moments when he'd zone out staring at her—it was because she was just some stand-in.  
  
So his panic about her face getting hurt—it was because she was just some stand-in.  
  
So the way he always watched her face when they were in bed together—  
  
That was because she was just a fucking stand-in.  
  
She cried until she felt like her chest was going to cave in, walking through the rain until she was soaked through and finally collapsed on her apartment floor, completely wrecked.  
  
She had no idea how long she lay there before slowly pulling herself together.  
  
The tears on her face had dried, and her head was finally clear. Riley dug into her purse and pulled out a business card.  
  
Two weeks ago, she'd gotten up at some trendy bar in West Hollywood and performed an original song she'd written for Michele.  
  
Afterward, this talent scout had approached her.  
  
James Montez from Eternal Music Group had told her she had serious vocal chops and the right look, asking if she'd ever thought about going pro.  
  
His label could send her overseas for three years of intensive training, turn her into a legitimate recording artist.  
  
Music was Riley's whole world, and she'd definitely dreamed of making it big. But wanting to stay close to Michele, she'd turned James down flat.  
  
He'd left his card anyway, just in case.  
  
Now, knowing the truth, there was zero reason to stick around and play substitute anymore.  
  
Staring at the number on the card, Riley picked up her phone with cold, shaking fingers.  
  
The moment he picked up, she cleared her throat, her voice hoarse and exhausted.  
  
""James? This is Riley Bolton. I'm ready to sign that contract.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Riley! You finally came to your senses? Let's connect on WhatsApp and meet tomorrow to hash out the details.""  
  
Hearing the excitement in James's voice, Riley nodded silently and added his contact.  
  
Shortly after hanging up, she heard footsteps outside.  
  
A few seconds later, the door opened and Michele walked in, shaking raindrops off his umbrella.  
  
Seeing her sitting on the hardwood floor like a broken doll, he frowned. ""Jesus, you're completely soaked. What happened?""  
  
""Forgot my umbrella.""  
  
Her wet hair was plastered across her face, and with the motion lights off, Michele couldn't read her expression in the dim room.  
  
He reached down and ruffled her damp hair. ""You're still such a mess. Download a weather app or something.""  
  
Riley said nothing.  
  
After watching him head into the master bathroom, she finally peeled her numb body off the floor and shuffled to the guest bath.  
  
After a scalding shower, she lay in their king-sized bed staring at the ceiling, her mind completely blank.  
  
Minutes later, Michele slipped under the Egyptian cotton sheets beside her, his hair still damp from his shower.  
  
That familiar scent of his cologne—cedar and something distinctly masculine—hit her immediately. It made her think of all those nights when she'd breathed it in while he moved above her, when she'd thought it meant something.  
  
Unable to stop herself, she reached for him, her fingers slowly, deliberately pushing up his gray cotton t-shirt.  
  
There, just above his heart, were two letters in bold black ink—  
  
\*\*SE\*\*  
  
She'd seen this tattoo so many times before.  
  
During all those late nights when he'd pin her wrists above her head, when she'd arch beneath him and catch glimpses of those letters through her half-closed eyes. When he'd hover over her, sweat dripping from his chest onto hers, and she'd trace her tongue along his collarbone, always wondering but never daring to ask.  
  
But now, seeing those letters again, her throat tightened and tears burned her eyes. Her voice came out hoarse and broken. ""What do those letters stand for?""  
  
Michele went completely still for a moment, his gaze dropping to where her finger was tracing the ink. When he spoke, his voice was soft but filled with a tenderness she'd never heard directed at her—not in three years.  
  
""Someone really important.""  
  
He paused, seeming to misread why she'd lifted his shirt, why her hands were on his chest. ""Hey, you're probably getting sick from being out in that rain. Let's just sleep tonight, yeah? I don't want to wear you out.""  
  
The rejection hit like a slap. He brushed her hands away, tugged his shirt back down, and clicked off the bedside lamp.  
  
The bedroom plunged into darkness.  
  
Riley lay there in the suffocating silence, tears streaming down her face and soaking into the pillowcase.  
  
The next morning, Michele was up before dawn. He didn't grab his usual coffee or protein shake, just threw on his Delta Air Lines jacket and headed for the door.  
  
Seeing the rain still hammering against their floor-to-ceiling windows, and knowing how much he usually hated flying in bad weather, Riley called after him. ""Wait—don't you have the week off? Where are you going?""  
  
Michele looked almost... happy. There was this lightness in his usually cold expression, an actual smile playing at his lips as he grabbed his umbrella. ""Got something important to take care of. Just stay in today, alright?""  
  
The door clicked shut before she could respond.  
  
Staring at where he'd disappeared, Riley turned back toward their bedroom. That's when she noticed his iPhone buzzing incessantly on the nightstand.  
  
She picked it up and the WhatsApp conversation filled the screen.  
  
The contact name at the top made her stomach drop: \*\*Sharpay\*\* ♥  
  
\*""What time does your flight get in? It's absolutely pouring here. Don't even think about calling an Uber—I'm picking you up myself.""\*  
  
The caring tone, the immediate concern about the weather—it was nothing like his casual ""download a weather app"" from last night.  
  
So this was how he treated someone he actually gave a damn about.  
  
Riley barely had time to process it before she heard his key in the lock again.  
  
She quickly set the phone down and slipped into their walk-in closet, heart pounding.  
  
By the time she'd done her makeup and emerged, both Michele and his phone were gone.  
  
She grabbed her Chanel bag and called an Uber.  
  
The coffee shop in Beverly Hills was exactly the kind of trendy spot where industry people made deals. Riley spotted James Montez immediately—mid-forties, expensive suit, the kind of guy who'd discovered half the artists on the radio.  
  
After some small talk about LA traffic, they settled into a private booth.  
  
""Alright, let me lay this out for you,"" James said, spreading papers across the marble table. ""We're talking three years in London—vocal coaching, songwriting workshops, media training, the works. Then we launch you globally.""  
  
He slid a thick contract toward her, and Riley's breath caught when she saw the letterhead.  
  
\*\*Eternal Music Group\*\*  
  
She knew that logo. Eternal was the holy grail for every musician on the planet—the label behind Taylor Swift's record-breaking albums, Ariana Grande's sold-out stadium tours, Billie Eilish's Grammy dominance. If you were signed to Eternal, you'd made it to the absolute top of the music world.  
  
""Holy shit,"" she whispered.  
  
""Exactly."" James grinned. ""People would literally sell their souls to get a meeting with Eternal, let alone a development deal. When you turned me down two weeks ago, I honestly thought you were insane.""  
  
Riley stared at the contract, thinking about how close she'd come to throwing this away. All for a guy who had another woman's initials tattooed over his heart.  
  
She let out a bitter laugh and signed her name with a flourish.  
  
James practically glowed as he tucked the signed papers into his briefcase.  
  
""Riley, you just made the smartest decision of your life. We're gonna turn you into a goddamn superstar. This is intensive training though—completely closed off from the outside world. Go home, pack your life up. We fly out in two weeks.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Riley made a note of the date and said her polite goodbyes.  
  
On the drive home, Michele's call came through, his voice urgent and panicked in a way she'd never heard before.  
  
""You're not home?""  
  
She paused, about to answer, when he cut her off. ""I don't care where you are—get to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center right fucking now.""  
  
In all their time together, Riley had never heard him this frantic.  
  
She hesitated for a few seconds, then told the Uber driver to change direction.  
  
When she rushed into the ER, she found Michele standing there completely unharmed.  
  
If it wasn't him who was hurt, then who...?  
  
Before she could ask what had happened, a nurse in blue scrubs whisked her into an adjacent room.  
  
""You're type O negative, correct?""  
  
Riley nodded, confused, as the nurse conducted a standard pre-donation screening—blood pressure, iron levels, medical history. Then without much warning, she expertly inserted a collection needle into Riley's arm.  
  
The sharp pinch made her wince. That's when it hit her—they were drawing her blood.  
  
The phlebotomist monitored the collection while making conversation. ""So honey, what's your relationship with that gentleman in the waiting area? His girlfriend was involved in a severe motor vehicle accident outside LAX—critical condition when the ambulance brought her in. He's been making calls to every contact he has, including hospital administration.""  
  
""We're experiencing a shortage of O-negative units, and he's been working his network trying to locate compatible donors. Must be quite devoted to move this many resources for someone.""  
  
Those words felt like a sledgehammer to Riley's chest.  
  
Like someone had reached in and crushed her heart with their bare hands, then let go and left her suffocating.  
  
So Michele had dragged her here to be Sharpay Evans' personal blood bank?  
  
Forget how completely fucked up it was to make your replacement donate blood to the original—he knew damn well she had severe iron-deficiency anemia.  
  
Had he forgotten? Or did he just not give a shit because it was for Sharpay?  
  
After they finished the donation, Riley sat in that plastic chair for a solid thirty minutes before she could stand without getting dizzy. During that entire time, Michele never once came to check on her. Never sent a text asking if she was okay.  
  
She didn't need to guess where he was. Obviously camped out in Sharpay's room like some lovesick teenager.  
  
Made sense. She was just the stand-in. Why would she deserve his attention?  
  
Riley let out a hollow laugh and used the wall for support as she made her way out. That's when she saw the surgical suite lights had been turned off.  
  
A surgeon in green scrubs accompanied the patient as the nursing team wheeled her toward recovery, and Michele immediately fell into step beside the gurney, his face carved with worry as they entered a private room.  
  
Through the floor-to-ceiling window, Riley watched him pull a chair right up to the bedside, gripping those bandaged hands like they were made of glass, his expression raw with terror and relief.  
  
The sight nearly brought her to her knees.  
  
In all the years she'd known Michele Morrone, no matter what crisis hit—flight emergencies, family drama, financial stress—he always maintained that cool pilot composure. Like nothing in the world could shake him.  
  
Five years, and this was the first time she'd ever seen him look completely vulnerable.  
  
So this was what Michele looked like when he actually loved someone.  
  
For the next four or five days, Michele didn't come home to their Malibu condo.  
  
Riley knew he was practically living at Cedars-Sinai. She didn't try calling or texting.  
  
Instead, she did three things.  
  
First, she submitted her resignation from the marketing firm via email.  
  
Second, she pulled out her matching luggage set and started packing three years of her life.  
  
Third, she grabbed a red marker and circled her departure date on their shared wall calendar.  
  
Watching that day creep closer, her shattered heart finally started to feel something like peace.  
  
On the first sunny day after LA's unusual week of storms, Michele finally walked through their front door.  
  
He spotted the changes immediately.  
  
Looking at the cardboard banker's boxes stacked by their kitchen island, he frowned. ""Why'd you clean out your entire office?""  
  
Then he noticed the open suitcases in their bedroom, his breathing becoming shallow. ""What the hell are you packing for?""  
  
Finally, he saw the circled date on their shared calendar and whipped around to face her. ""And what's with marking the 30th like it's some kind of deadline?""  
  
Three rapid-fire questions made Riley pause in folding her clothes.  
  
She didn't see the point in lying anymore. ""I got offered something better, so I quit my job. I'm packing because I'm relocating pretty far from here. The 30th is my last day in LA.""  
  
She took a steadying breath, preparing to tell him she was ending their relationship and walking away from this whole fucking mess.  
  
""Can we talk for a minute? There's something really important we need to discuss. I—""  
  
Michele's iPhone suddenly buzzed against the granite countertop.  
  
Seeing Sharpay's name light up the screen, he immediately swiped to answer.  
  
Through the speaker, Sharpay's voice came through crystal clear—that same sweet, slightly breathy tone Riley remembered from high school.  
  
""Michele, I can't thank you enough for everything these past few days. My girlfriends are throwing me this welcome-back party at Soho House tonight. You should totally come—it'll be fun!""  
  
Michele was about to accept when he glanced at Riley. ""What were you trying to tell me just now? Is it urgent?""  
  
The subtext was obvious: \*Are you more important than Sharpay Evans?\*  
  
Riley felt something inside her just... break. Like the last thread holding her together finally snapped.  
  
She shook her head, forcing her voice to stay level. ""It's nothing major. If you've got plans, go ahead.""  
  
Hearing another woman's voice, Sharpay's tone turned curious and slightly territorial. ""Oh, your girlfriend's there too? You should bring her along! She's the one who donated blood for me, right? I've been dying to thank her properly.""  
  
At the mention of blood donation, Michele went completely still. He quickly muted the call and stepped toward the balcony.  
  
Riley couldn't hear the rest of their conversation, but somehow twenty minutes later she found herself being ushered into Michele's car, her protests completely ignored.  
  
During the drive down PCH, Michele offered what could generously be called an explanation.  
  
""So, the woman we're meeting—Sharpay—she's an old family friend. She got into a pretty bad accident when she flew back from New York last week. Cedars-Sinai was running low on O-negative blood, and I remembered you two had the same type. It was touch-and-go for a while, so I called you over without really thinking it through. You've been kind of distant lately—are you upset about how that whole thing went down?""  
  
""No, I've been dealing with some anemia issues and trying to recover. That's why I haven't been texting much.""  
  
Riley's voice was completely monotone, like she was discussing the weather.  
  
Seeing how pale and hollow-cheeked she looked in the passenger seat, Michele felt a sharp stab of guilt.  
  
Fuck.  
  
How had he completely forgotten about her iron deficiency?  
  
He was about to apologize, maybe suggest picking up some expensive jewelry to make up for it, but she'd already turned to stare out the window at the Pacific Ocean, looking like she'd checked out of the conversation entirely.  
  
So he cranked up the music and kept driving toward West Hollywood.

I had a bacon & cheese burger and it was totally worth it. The super fresh bun was toasted and the bacon nice and crispy. The patties combined with the cheese and sause with the caramelized onion was a flavor explosion in my mouth.  They also offer a mean coffee but soft drinks and mineral water  is also on offer.

1kz14st,https://www.reddit.com/r/echoofstillness/comments/1kz14st/heres_a_thought_on_finding_unexpected_connection/,Here's a Thought on Finding Unexpected Connection,"Just a quiet thought I wanted to share. Earlier today, I was sitting in this cozy coffee shop, watching the hustle and bustle around me. I was kinda feeling that weird, almost intangible loneliness that sneaks up on us sometimes. You know, when you're surrounded by people but still feel a bit like you're an island? 

Anyway, I ended up overhearing a conversation between two friends sitting nearby. Wouldn't normally eavesdrop, but their voices sorta drifted my way. They were sharing stories, just talking about life, struggles, and dreams. 

It hit me how, just by truly listening, I felt a little less alone in my own thoughts. Like, even if I wasn't a part of the conversation, just hearing them connect reminded me of the simple bridge listening can build. It’s kinda crazy, imo, how that's enough to ease that sense of isolation we carry around sometimes. 

Made me think that sometimes the key isn't just being heard, but also being open to hearing others. Maybe it's through these small moments, like the simple act of listening, that we find unexpected comfort. 🕊️",8,1748602084.0,echoofstillness,0,1.0,False

1kz13rs,https://i.redd.it/c8xbaalffw3f1.jpeg,"I will never not use these style hooks (swimbait) for bass fishing plastics ever again, and I wish I knew about them sooner","""Product review?"" Of sorts, because Idk all the manufacturers of these style hooks, *but I love them.*

I have always hated plastics until last year. I would rarely fish them. I caught more sticks and logs than I care to count using plastics. Kind of annoying to rig, even a well-made Texas rig was still pretty prone to snags, gotta readjust the fucking plastic occasionally to often, just a pain in the ass, *and I'm here to fish and have a good time.*

These hooks? Absolutely perfect. I love them because I almost never snag shit with them, the plastic almost always stays in place because it's corkscrewed down *thank God,* and because the weight is on the bottom (which is why I'm not snagging shit as often) it's so easy to just bounce shit around on the bottom. They're perfect. I take one of those dumbass coffee flavored (KVD I think?) rage claws or whatever, with the wiggly ass arms, throw it out, the motion is perfect, the bulk is under it so it isn't intrusive, and the fish can't stop themselves.

I wish I had known about these magnificent bastards before, but I don't go to the sporting goods section to look at hooks, *those aren't attractive.* Unlike the bass, I want to look at all the crank baits and whatchamajigs, then think ""why doesn't someone just put the fucking weight on the bottom?"" While I think of ways to Macgyver some split shot on the shank of a hook. Now I almost exclusively use plastics since the biggest obstacle - being a pain in the ass sometimes - is effectively removed.

I quit nicotine by switching to 0mg about 2 weeks ago but started again 2 days ago because I was becoming depressed and nonfunctional having to fight a war in my head from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed. After some reflection, I think the biggest issue is that I tried to do it unprepared. I want to try again, cold turkey without the 0mg starting tomorrow. 

My biggest thing is that I function on routine, and vaping is a massive part of my daily routines. I want to continue my routines but shift them off of vaping. At home, this looks like me sitting on the back porch, scrolling or talking on the phone and vaping. When I tried to quit, I essentially stopped going outside and had no motivation to do anything besides watch TV and eat. I think I am going to try and make small cups of coffee to sip on as a way to get me to go outside still at home. I need help with what to do at work though. I work for a small used car lot and the job is highly stressful. One benefit I have is I am able to go outside as often as I’d like, as long as we’re not busy. Typically this looks like me going out once every hour for about 5-10mins. I need suggestions on what to do when I take my small breaks at work. Gum makes me angry chew when I want to be vaping, but considering trying sipping on a fountain drink and mints. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!",2,1748601957.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False

1kz11xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1kz11xp/i_build_a_file_manager_that_let_you_edit_locally/,I build a file manager that let you edit locally synced Google Doc files,"This is a recent update of Tokie.

I added Google Docs support that let you edit the Google doc files with a single click.

It avoids the need to open them in a separate browser tab for every file that you want to check out.

Here is what I did, for those who are interested in the technical details:

When Google Drive syncs online documents to your local drive, unlike word/excel files, it only sync a .gdoc / .gsheet file which contains no actual data.

https://preview.redd.it/fuzrieilcw3f1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=a219a00c98cc5a37db93044750249fd940d0bf6f

It is smart, because it is faster to sync, and don't take up space in your local disk.

When you open this file, it is basically a unique ID that represents the actual file online.

https://preview.redd.it/gu6mgrx6dw3f1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e9f269279386f9eeb17bcf96e3fd263af702ac1

But what if you want to edit it, just like other local files?

The reason a lot of us still uses locally synced folders, is because we have files that has to open locally, and only relying on the Google Drive website won't do it.

So, I thought, what if we bring all file editing experience locally? By this I don't mean an offline mode, just in terms of opening windows, an experience that is closer to handling files locally.

One thing that only makes things harder is that we all end up with a few dozens of squeezed tabs in our browser, so it is not where you find you last opened online document link.

\--------

In Tokie, it supported webview when I launched it, you can save a weblink locally, and it opens in the side peek panel. (Again avoiding bookmarks and tabs in browser)

This mechanism is essentially how Google Drive does it with Google doc files.

So I thought, why not use this to open Google Docs. Only that we need to tweak the file opening process a little to piece together the actual URL, no big deal.

And that's what I build:

https://preview.redd.it/wx2s84n4ew3f1.jpg?width=1764&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2d8fab5f6a4ecc8dbb18883c1add2bae93d96aa

A single click on any locally synced Google Doc files, it opens the actual file, fully editable, in the side peek panel, just like any other web links you save locally with Tokie.

For me this makes a lot of sense if I just want a quick peek at the file, or copy something from it, or even edit it. I can open multiple tokie windows for multiple files if needed, but they will be opened exactly where it is saved.

It just made navigating through files a lot easier. You can try it out in [tokie.is](http://tokie.is) if this make sense for you, and let me know that I'm not alone in this.",1,1748601799.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

1kz0yrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1kz0yrn/helicopter_narcissistic_parents_on_solo_travel/,Helicopter / narcissistic parents on solo travel,"Hi. I’m not sure if this is the right sub to post on. I just need to vent and I’d like some support if anyone can relate at all. I don’t think my parents are as bad as some, but all my issues are likely due to them.

I (29F) am the first born child of 4. My parents are introverted and come from very different families. 

I’ve been told by therapists my parents are selfish and want what’s best for them, and not what’s best for me. Like they want what they think is what’s best for me. 

Growing up my dad was verbally abusive and would tell me no to doing anything. He would say no before yes. Sometimes he needed time to think, and instead of saying that, would yell ‘No’ at me to going out with my friends or walking down the street with my bestie. 

They were and are overprotective. Which led to me sneaking out in 10th grade. My dad has never apologized in my life, he would only buy things as a ‘sorry’ gift. 

My mom always says ‘in one ear out the other’. Or will refuse to reason on anything that doesn’t sit well with her. 

An example is I had surgery last year, and my parents insisted they take care of me, and not my ex. They screamed at me on the phone, and when it came time for surgery, my dad was surprisingly fine. But when my mom came in for her turn (which btw I needed no help. I got a nose surgery and was fine the day after but they wanted to help out, which is a kind gesture in theory) but my mom started complaining on how I SHOULD be healing. Put on music, talk to friends on the phone, pretend I’m not here, etc. I was drawing on my iPad and put on nice fireplace music and she didn’t agree with it. Like what are you talking about?? 

Then it got heated and when I said the word ‘boundaries’ because my therapist at the time was worried about my parents coming over and said I needed to implement some. My mom freaked out and was offended I was asking for boundaries in my home, because she came all the way over here to help me, even though I told them I didn’t need them to. 

She made me feel guilty and threatened to leave and said she’s a horrible mom etc etc. I apologized, because she can never be wrong. They never cross boundaries. They know best. 

My parents were upset when I started my tattoo career. They said mean things to me, ‘why did you even go to college? What are you doing?’ Amongst name calling. Now they both have tattoos from me. Because they see I support myself and I know what I’m doing. 

I have a very painful memory from when I was 22. I got off work one night (coffee shop) and it’s right by a pier. It’s a lit tourist area. Not a bad area at all. I was feeling so good and so myself, and I wanted to call them to say hi. They asked what I was doing and they called me a fucking idiot and that I was going to get kidnapped. I’ll never forget it because I was an adult, who is and was highly self aware. 

I cried so much, and they gaslight abs deny they do these things and they only want the best. I’m sure there’s a level in which they are just expressing their concern now but because of how they raised me, I can’t interpret it any differently. I get extreme anxiety at the thought of telling them I’m traveling. I do it all without saying anything. They find out by social media and act like ‘why do you act like we’re these horrible helicopter parents? We just want to know where you are and that you’re okay. You can live you life’ 

But when I do, I get yelled at. My dad screamed at me for calling him an hour after I left my place to drive 6 hrs to Georgia. I was waiting until I was comfortable on the drive, and he freaked out “what if something happens?! Who will help you?” Not you??? You’re 6 hours away already why the fuck do they act like they can save me? 

So I drove 10+ hrs alone without telling them. They’re nosey and annoying.

Fast forward to now, and my anxiety around my thoughts. Basically me and my now ex traveled to Hungary for a month. My parents act like I can’t travel abroad without someone. Especially a male. That I’m incapable. I am 29. I literally live alone, I support myself fully. I am the one who downloads offline maps, language apps, researches all the good and bad areas, figures out public transit and scams to be weary of. I have internal jacket pockets and a bag close to my chest to avoid pick pockets. 
I think of adapters, battery backups, everything that the people I travel with don’t. 

And I am terrified to tell them I started my solo euro trip. I am in Austria now, and then going to Czech and Poland. I am capable. I am on female only travel apps. I stay in tourist heavy areas, I don’t stay out late. I don’t drink. 

America is scarier tbh, but they have only watched movies like ‘Taken’ and have this deluded perception of what will happen if I travel solo. I have to tell them because my ex is a YouTuber who streams and is going to mention us breaking up. There’s no avoiding it otherwise I just wouldn’t tell them. If I don’t and they find out through him, they’re get mad at me. 

I am just tired of being gaslit. Multiple exes have seen it happen. My therapists have said it sounds toxic. I can’t reason with my parents, they come back saying I had a great life growing up and should be grateful. They are incapable of hearing me out. My mom has gotten worse lately. She projects on me because her mom had dementia and she wishes I would talk to her constantly because she couldn’t talk to her mom for 13 years. I am so tired of the guilt tripping. My who family acts like I’m this girl who picks horrible men to date, I am too sensitive and should be more involved in the family. I am sad and can’t stand them. I think I will talk to my brother. He reasoned with me really well last time. I want to have a good relationship with some of them but my parents are so difficult. 

How can I be 29 and still feel like a child?

## Key Features analysis

the 12 oz cup market is diverse, with models varying significantly in materials, construction, and specialized features. A deep dive into these specifications provides insights into the performance and longevity of each cup.

**Material:** Examining the composition and quality of the materials used in making a 12 oz cup is paramount .

Stainless steel, especially 18/8 (304) grade, is a popular choice for its durability, rust resistance, and lack of flavor absorption. Ceramic, glass, or BPA-free plastic are option options, each offering unique aesthetic and functional properties. The material directly affects temperature retention, ease of cleaning, and overall lifespan of the cup.

**Insulation Type:** Insulation plays a pivotal role in maintaining optimal beverage temperature

Double-wall vacuum insulation is superior for hot and cold beverages, capable of keeping drinks hot for up to 6 hours and cold for over 24 hours. Foam insulation or single-walled construction provides minimal insulation, impacting the temperature of the contents quickly. Look for cups with a high degree of vacuum sealing for maximum thermal performance.

**Lid Design:** The features of the lid design plays a vital role in leak-proofing and spillproofing..

Screw-on lids generally offer a more secure seal than press-on lids, crucial for preventing leaks when traveling. Manny lids feature slide closures for easy opening and closing, while others incorporate a straw opening for added convenience. Ventilation holes prevent pressure buildup, while gaskets enhance spill protection.Dishwasher-safe lids simplify the cleaning process.

**Dimensions and Ergonomics:** A cup's physical properties affect its ease to hold, store and whether or not it will fit in vehicle cup holders.

The diameter and height influence stability and portability. Thinner profiles fit more comfortably in car cup holders. Ergonomic designs create grip, which facilitates ease of use and prevents slippage. Some designs feature tapered edges to improve comfort when sipping.

**Coating and Finish:** The design of the exterior coating and finish can greatly influence grip, aesthetic appeal, durability of the finish coat itself

Powder coatings offer a textured, non-slip grip and are highly resistant to scratches and fading. Brushed stainless steel provides a sleek and modern look while remaining resistant to fingerprints. Glossy finishes are often visually appealing but may be more prone to scratches and smudges.**Certifications and Safety:** Autonomous third-party safety regulations gives buyers assurances of potential health hazards.

Cups bearing certifications such as BPA-free and FDA approval assure consumers that the materials used meet safety standards. Look for cups that are lead-free and adhere to relevant health regulations in your region. Certifications provide added confidence in the product's safety and environmental impact.

If there’s one thing that will instantly level up your home brewing, it’s not a fancy kettle or a new dripper — it’s understanding grind size. Yet most Indian brewers either don’t own a grinder or rely on pre-ground coffee without adjusting it for their brewing method.

Here’s why grind size matters more than almost anything else, and how to use it correctly.

Grind size controls:
1. Extraction time: How fast water moves through coffee.

2. Surface area: How much flavor is pulled from each particle.

3. Flavor profile: Too fine = bitter/astringent; too coarse = sour/under-extracted.

Getting it right is like tuning an instrument — you can have great beans and gear, but if the grind is off, your cup will suffer.


If your coffee tastes off — before you blame the beans or the water — try adjusting your grind. It’s one of the cheapest and most powerful fixes you can make.

Drop your current grinder model and what method you brew with — or if you’re still buying pre-ground, what challenges you’re facing. Let’s dial in together ☕️

Yamori gathered his remaining strength, hoping the voice he had heard was a sign that the way outside the closet was free of danger. And so, he slide-opened the door in a swift movement, as if to ward off an evil fate.

Nothing. No one. He was sure the voice he’d heard came from right behind that door, but the corridor was empty. The place was still upside down and decayed, but calm. Maybe too calm. The red lights were no longer flickering; they had turned a bluish hue.  
As Yamori stepped out of the closet, still cautious but no longer gripped by the terror he had just endured, the absence of whoever that voice belonged to left him with a deep, uneasy feeling. He walked back to where he came from, relieved but still with deep mistrust, hoping to find a way out of the house.

The floor felt like walking on crumpled, torn paper. The walls seemed to have been clawed at by something gigantic. The ceiling, in places, was completely ruined, and the plumbing was leaking. The hallways were left in a state as if a demonic war had taken place the day before. In some places, steel bars jutted out from the reinforced concrete walls, resembling scattered spears or arrows after a savage assault. Only the sound of water leaking from the plumbing and gently trickling down the stairs contrasted with the dark scene, a soft melody, like a waterfall in the forest or a gentle rain on a cloudy autumn day.

 

Yamori went blindly, without knowing where to go or what to do, he just followed the flow of the water. It led to the staircase, the one that had been blocked earlier by rubble and debris. Aware and cautious, Yamori descended step by step. The railings were twisted, rusted, and each step felt like a new world of danger and terror to him. Getting from one floor to another had always been a matter of seconds, but after everything he had gone through, his trembling legs would not allow him to move quickly. He was like an old man crushed by the years and the weight of life’s experiences. The journey from the closet to the first floor was disorienting at best, but eventually, he arrived.

The first floor - the heart of the share-house, is a wide room with a coworking space, a shoebox area, a bar where tenants make coffee, a cozy smoking room, the manager's office, and so much more. It is a rather cozy place that fosters interaction and connection. Fake bricks on the concrete walls, armchairs, designer stools, fake plants, fake parquet, real apocalypse.

Now everything is upside down. Broken tables, ripped chairs, burnt stationery, occult graffiti, a decayed ceiling, dust. The heart of the share-house was nothing more than a ruin. And not just any ruin, a ruin that screams, *""Happy neighbors are welcome, if they come in a coffin.""*

What a dreadful scene for Yamori, but there was no time for regrets. At that very moment, he just wanted to get out of the house. So, he ran toward the genkan, the only gateway to the neighborhood where people come in and out of the house. Some would leave their shoes there and then get scolded by the house manager for not using their shoebox.

Yamori rushed forward but suddenly stopped. The genkan was no longer what it used to be: he almost fell into a deep hole. There was no way he could jump over that pit and grab the door to just leave.

For a brief moment, maybe half a second, Yamori tried to gauge how deep the hole was. But it was so dark it felt infinite. Then he focused for a moment, and from the depths, sounds seemed to rise to the surface: a mixture of screams and rusty machinery. In other words: Yamori was trapped in his own home.

Then he thought, *""Maybe I can climb the fence in the patio.""*

He turned back and headed straight toward the glass doors that opened onto the patio. But both sliding doors were blocked under debris. Yamori didn’t want to risk injuring himself trying to clear the rubble, the rust and dust could easily cause an infection.

He considered another option. He grabbed a stool, lifted it, and aimed at one of the many wide windows, ready to smash it and make a run for it.

But he froze.

In the darkness, on the other side, the patio was crawling with figures. Emerging from the shadows wearing black capirotes. And even though their eyes were hidden under their pointed hoods, it felt as if they were staring straight at Yamori, silent and dreadful.

 

Once again, Yamori was overwhelmed by fear and fled. He rushed toward the stairs, hoping to reach the closet where he had previously hidden. Nearly tripping over debris multiple times, he eventually made it to the staircase, only to be stunned: the stairs were now sealed off by a rusty metal gate covered in barbed wire. He took a few steps back, shaking his head as if to say, *“No way… how is this even possible?”*. Desperate, he grabbed the gate and shook it, hoping it would break loose or reveal a weakness. But it held firm. Yamori had no choice but to look for another escape route.

He returned to the first floor, planning to hide behind the wreckage so the black capirotes wouldn’t see him. But the entire room was now flooded. The water wasn’t very deep, about knee level, but it was dark, murky, and deep enough to conceal anything imaginable. The staircase was a dead end. The water looked treacherous and felt like ice. Yamori had no other choice. He took a deep breath and stepped in, one foot, then the other. It reeked of sewers and bile, but he was thankful he wasn’t barefoot. For a moment, he even considered swimming across the genkan pit to reach the door.

As he ventured deeper into the heart of the house, he realized how much darker it had become. Shadows swallowed the walls. Anything could be hiding, lurking, just waiting to pounce or lash out with unspeakable violence. Yamori trudged forward, the thick water slowing his every step. He braced himself, ready to dive if needed, if it meant reaching the exit.

Then suddenly, his attention snapped toward the sound of splashing, gentle ripples echoing from somewhere nearby. And beneath it all… a voice.

Faint. Pleading. Calling for help.

 

Without hesitation, Yamori ran, ""finally, someone like me"". Someone was drowning, crying for help. Although the water was not deep in that area, it could be that whoever was drowning had been overtaken by panic, unable to control their body. Yamori grabbed the person’s hand and pulled them back to their feet.

After catching his breath, the man, still unknown to Yamori, took a sharp inhale and said, “You saved me… or maybe I saved you, I don’t know. Either way, I’m grateful. This place has become a real nightmare.

\- And I’m grateful I finally found someone to talk to. I don’t know what’s happening here; everything went so fast. I saw that... monster, and that ghost, and now… said Yamori before being interrupted.

\- Monster? Ghost? What are you talking about? Anyway, I want to get out of this hell, and I’m sure you do too. I know a way out, but we need to drain this water before it swallows us completely.

\- Wait, what’s your name?” asked Yamori.

\- Do you really think we have time for that? Follow me. There’s a drain not far from here. I’m not strong enough to open it alone, but the two of us might have better luck,” the man replied.

 

Without another word, he turned and started walking. Yamori stood still, unable to grasp what kind of person he was dealing with. The man looked back at him, his eyes pleading for Yamori to follow. And so, he did.

They were silently heading toward the gym, bath, and laundry area through a narrow corridor covered with drawings and paintings made by the residents since the share-house company had bought the building from that old factory. These naive pieces of art were once inspiring, funny, and cute: reminders to tenants to take life easy.

Until now.

In the dark, they twisted into grotesque figures, unreadable words, looking more like blood stains and splashes.

When they finally reached the bath entrance level, Yamori perked up, it made sense to him that there might be a water drain nearby. But the man he had just saved didn’t react, and kept walking like a sinister scarecrow.

They eventually passed the gym, some vending machines that looked completely depleted, and then the laundry area, which reeked of damp, dirty clothes. Far in the distance, neon lights flickered, it was almost comforting, if one ignored the freezing, foul-smelling water and the occasional unidentifiable filth floating in it.

Yamori had never come this far into the house before, he’d never had a reason to. He found himself strangely intrigued. What was this section? Maybe an old utility room? Or storage?

There was nothing particularly remarkable about this room, except perhaps that it was less dilapidated than the rest of what Yamori had seen so far. A few cardboard boxes were scattered here and there, along with posters clinging to the walls - so damaged and faded that deciphering their original content was impossible. A vending machine stood in the corner, leaking a thick, black substance. Nearby, a lone bicycle wheel lay abandoned beside a stack of rotting magazines.

The neon flickers. Yamori and the unknown man stand motionless in the room, water up to their knees, both quietly taking in their surroundings. The liquid is murky, with vague shapes drifting beneath the surface. Yet it’s still clear enough to make out the floor tiles. Scattered across them lie mundane objects: small pliers, DVD cases, empty glass bottles, circuit boards, so many things, all useless now.

Suddenly, Yamori glances at the man. He neither speaks nor moves. His eyes are hidden in the shadows, staring blankly, unmoving. Only the flickering neon and the soft lapping of water disturb the silence. The two men, face to face in the stench.  
In this room, there is no valve to turn, and outrageously, no water drain on the floor.

1kz0ta3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuttingEdgeEdits/comments/1kz0ta3/how_to_convert_raw_to_jpeg_my_workflow_shortcuts/,"How to Convert RAW to JPEG? My Workflow, Shortcuts & All the Weird Stuff That (Kinda) Works","So here’s the deal: I shoot in RAW. Always. I don’t care if I’m filming for a paid gig or just snapping stills while hiking – RAW is my default. The flexibility in post is non-negotiable. But then comes the annoying part that nobody likes to talk about: exporting that beautiful, fat RAW file into a usable format like JPEG without pulling your hair out.

And yeah, I’ve been down the rabbit hole – Lightroom, Adobe Camera Raw, Capture One, the whole gang. But depending on the shoot, the gear, or the system I’m working from (read: a beat-up laptop vs. studio desktop), the process of converting can either be smooth sailing or a CPU-melting nightmare.

So if you're wondering how to convert RAW to JPEG, let me walk you through my pain, some workarounds, and the hacky stuff I figured out from lurking forums like r/SonyAlpha, StackExchange, and a few niche YouTube tutorials buried under 240p thumbnails.

# The ""Traditional"" Way (That’s Sometimes Way Too Slow)

Okay, yeah – Lightroom. Let’s just get that out of the way. Everyone recommends it. You import your RAWs, tweak your white balance, exposure, maybe slap on a preset if you're feeling spicy, then export as JPEG. Great, in theory.

But here’s my issue: batch processing RAW files in Lightroom sounds easy until you try to dump 500+ images from a Sony Alpha 7IV on a 4-year-old laptop. It’s like watching paint dry in reverse. Fan screaming, RAM choking, and half the time, the export freezes unless I batch them in tiny chunks. I’ve tried optimizing catalogs, clearing cache – all the usual stuff. Still a slog.

Same goes for Capture One. Fantastic color handling, especially for skin tones, but that comes at the cost of speed if you’re not running a nuclear reactor.

# The Weird Hack I Found That... Sorta Works?

So here’s a trick I figured out when I was on location with no Adobe license (and no internet). I was transferring files from my camera to a portable SSD and needed quick JPEGs to send to a client. I remembered that some RAWs come with embedded JPEG previews. I used this little app called *FastStone Image Viewer* – yeah, I know, the UI looks like it hasn’t been updated since 2003, but it worked. I batch-exported embedded previews, and boom: I had JPEGs. They weren’t high-res edits, but for quick proofs? Solid workaround.

Also, *IrfanView* (yes, that’s still alive) has a similar batch-convert feature. Super lightweight, no bloat, and honestly underrated.

# The “I Can’t Believe This Worked” Shortcut

Okay, don’t laugh – but I also stick with Movavi Photo Editor to ""extract"" usable JPEGs from RAW previews when I am in a pinch. Once I was on the road, showing unedited photos to a client who needed quick approval shots. My editing rig was back home, and I only had my travel laptop – which groans at the sight of Lightroom.

So I pulled open the RAW files (yep, Movavi Photo Editor supports tons of uncompressed RAW formats), let them load, and used the AI auto-enhance tool to give them a quick polish. I didn’t need full edits – just decent-looking images for quick feedback. Movavi let me overlay text, crop, adjust colors with presets, and boom – exported to JPEG. No lag, no drama.

Was it perfect? No. You can’t tweak the RAW data itself, just the embedded version – but honestly, for fast-turnaround work or social teasers? It was surprisingly effective. And way more intuitive than some of the “pro” software that comes with a 300-page manual and a subscription fee.

Plus, it has some cool AI tools – object removal, skin retouching, background eraser – which I now use way more than I care to admit when cleaning up test shots.

# MacOS vs Windows: One Is Friendlier Than the Other

If you’re on a Mac, the built-in *Preview* app is shockingly helpful. You can open RAWs (depending on the camera model), and export to JPEG straight from there. No plugins, no nonsense. I’ve used it a few times when I was editing on my MacBook at a cafe, and didn’t have my usual Adobe setup. It’s barebones, but it gets the job done.

Windows, on the other hand, makes it feel like you’re asking for a miracle just to view a RAW file, let alone convert it. I’ve had to install specific codecs, and even then, Windows Photos acts like RAWs are cursed files from another dimension.

# Batch Converting Without Wanting to Cry

The holy grail, right? You just want to dump a bunch of RAWs and spit out JPEGs without babying each one. Honestly, the best way I found for batch converting – when you don’t want to load everything into a full editor – is *RawTherapee*. Open-source, powerful, and surprisingly efficient. It’s not as “user-friendly” as Movavi or Lightroom, but it’s got muscle where it counts. I batch processed an entire wedding shoot through it once on a Linux system and didn’t lose my sanity. That’s saying something.

# But Let’s Be Real...

Even with all these tools, it’s never really seamless. RAW files from different cameras behave differently. What works for Canon might choke on Sony .ARW files. What’s buttery on a Mac might crash on Windows. That’s just part of the game. You get used to having a few tricks in your back pocket – whether it’s using lightweight tools like FastStone or falling back on screen recorders like Movavi for quick grabs.

Sometimes, it's not even about converting RAWs in the best quality – it's about getting something usable to work with. Clients don’t care if the image was pulled from a proper export or a screenshot. They care that it looks good. Period.

Anyway, if anyone’s got a “one-click and done” solution that isn’t cloud-based, doesn’t fry your RAM, and doesn’t cost more than my camera body – I’m listening. Until then, I’ll be over here manually converting 200 RAWs, sipping bad coffee, and regretting not just shooting in JPEG to begin with.

Stay sharp out there.

I thought about a bike trip and even though it is faster and more convenient, it is a bit restrictive when it comes to long trip - weather, stay, safety of luggage, etc.

I have been trying to find out what all I would need so that I won't have to rely on hotels or in some cases restaurants. I should be able to camp out in my car when I need to sleep or take a break. I am trying to find out what things I would need for this. Below are what I have so far. I would really appreciate any suggestions you might have.

1. Foldable bicycle: There are a few available for \~10k. I am not sure about the quality, but it should be good enough to explore cities without taking my car everywhere.

2. Inflatable mattress - Anyone has any experience with this? Can I sleep on this for a few days, if required? I saw a foldable mattress, but I think that might be meant for kids.

3. Car inverter - I think most of these are meant to convert DC to AC and then your adapter convert it back to DC. The car battery should be able to power my laptop for a few hours right? I have also seen a few expensive models which includes its own battery. This would be really convenient if I am spending a lot of time on my laptop, which I might. Or I could break for 3-4 hours, use my laptop and then start again and charge it while driving. 

4. Butane stove - I probably won't need it that often. But in a pinch, I can make black coffee, maybe boil eggs or have noodles. Butane because I can get canisters at any hardware store.

4. Inflatable pillow

5. Sleeping bag/Camping tent: This probably can be skipped, but if i have enough space in the car, I could take it with me.

  
Modification: I have a Swift - not new, but very reliable, and I am considering adding rails on top so that I can free up some space inside the cabin, if in case it becomes necessary.

  
I don't intent to live out my car throughout the trip. I would be staying in if I am not able to find a suitable place and if I think it is safe.

I have road side assistance in case of any issues.",1,1748600699.0,SoloTravel_India,2,1.0,False
