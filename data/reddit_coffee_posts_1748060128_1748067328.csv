1ku4sqa,https://i.redd.it/78njcocu8o2f1.png,Working Remotely with Data Annotation – My Honest Experience After Earning $15K While Studying,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my experience working with Data Annotation (DA) since I’ve noticed more people are curious about legit WFH options. I’ve been using the platform for about a year and a half now, and it’s helped me make over $15,000 whilst finishing up my degree in Business and Marketing here in the UK.

DA is similar to platforms like Outlier since you evaluate AI models, write prompts, give feedback, and work on a bunch of different projects. Some are creative, some technical, and some just need your honest opinion. I’ve worked on projects related to bilingual content, finance, business, safety, accuracy, and even a few STEM ones. Some require experience, but many are accessible even if you don’t have a formal background in the topic.

The best part about this job has been working from home or wherever I’ve got WiFi and coffee. The platform has become my main income source since graduating, and I’m now at nearly full-time earnings, completely remote. Payouts take about a week to verify, but you can withdraw every three days. Work volume can vary, but if you’re consistent and qualify for different project types, there’s real potential here. You do sign an NDA, so I can’t go into detail on the specific companies I’ve worked with, but they’re the biggest companies, especially in the AI field. Like any freelance or remote gig, there can be dry spells. However, this is the best remote platform I have worked for and have consistently been able to work. Whether a student, recent grad, or just looking for more flexibility, this has been a game-changer for me.

Now I’m documenting the journey: the wins, the losses, and everything in between. 

I’ve also set up a Discord community — **WFH Earners Club** — for anyone who wants to get into remote work, learn how to qualify for projects, share progress, and stay motivated. Whether you're new to this or turning side gigs into full-time income, it's a space to connect, co-work, and grow together. Discord link: [https://discord.gg/h4z8TefppN](https://discord.gg/h4z8TefppN)

If you’re trying to build your own remote work lifestyle, come join us. We’re building something real, and it’s better when we do it together.

So since youth had been a huge fan of slightly obsessed with british humor/ comedy and Edgar Wright was no exception. And in all intents and purpose was the newest wave of that. Shawn of the Dead was a cultural milestone, Hot Fuzz all time comedy classic.

By Fuzz I as an American was fully obesseed with Wright and his brand of storytelling. Cirlcled backl even to his UK series Spaced which was also brilliant (And also starred Simon Peg).

So to cut to the chase as an Atlantan born American to suddenly realize he was telling an american story that was filmed in Atlanta sort of had me floored. But HERE is the part I didn't expect: Atlanta has seen a boom of many films being shot there, due to subsidies and many of whom use it as a placeholder for other locations like NY or even San Francisco, Wright chose to makr it take place ON location. And not onlt that HIGHLIGHT Atlanta as a sort of supporting if not main character.

In short I was an Atlantan born, Wright obessed fan who was suddenly treated to a story that placed Atlanta at the heart of it's story and one that if werent from there may not fully get.



To me Wright was part of a type of storytelling that existed in another universe UK, London humor which i so loved and was accustomed to.

And then all the sudden somes Baby Driver. An American focused Action based Romcom.

Yes I understtood the ptractiocalities of shooting on the downloaw in Atlanta but little did I know Wright would Allow Atlanta to be a starring player.

  
From the opening frame All of the sudden I was seeing familiar Atlanta Squad Cars on the tails of the Driver I was seeing named names of Coffee spots such as Atlanta staples as OCTANE Coffee and other familiar Atlanta signifiers.

But I cant' cant tell you enough as an Atlanta alum and film cinephile what a treat it was to see Baby, our main protagonist hop in the drivers seat in desperate need of a tune to turn to the ACTUAL Atlanta oldies station on the FM radio and switch on his song to enable him to carry on the plan. I guess what I'm saying is the attention to detail for a local here is notthing short of STUNNING in terms of nailing a texture of a place credibly and using it for an actual story moment given that only an intimate handful would even get the joke to begin with.

  
In short it was just wild to see a legendardy UK film director suddenly hook into really local niche detaisl and create these jokes. utterly surreal to be quite honest.",1,1748066294.0,TrueFilm,0,1.0,False

I have... questions.

Like, are we really at the point where relationship advice is coming from language models trained on Reddit posts and fanfiction? Is AI now our new therapist-slash-paranormal medium?

As devs and AI nerds, we all know LLMs are basically very talented pattern parrots, not omniscient marriage counselors. But this raises a pretty serious debate: if people are making life-changing decisions based on these outputs, where’s the line? Should we, as creators, put clearer guardrails on how this stuff is used? Or is it just part of the age-old ""user responsibility"" problem?

Have any of you witnessed (or accidentally caused) an example of someone taking an AI’s output a little too literally? How do we balance usefulness with potential for delusion?

Also: is ""AI cup reading"" going to be a startup pitch now? I don’t want to live in that timeline... but I also kinda do.

# Executive Summary

*Lord of the Mysteries* (LotM) has emerged as a significant global literary and transmedia property, demonstrating remarkable popularity driven by its distinctive genre fusion, intricate world-building, and profound character development. Originating as a Chinese web novel, it has achieved ""phenomenon-level IP"" status, evidenced by its extraordinary readership figures, particularly within China, where its audiobook version alone boasts 1.2 billion views and the web novel has attracted tens of millions of readers globally.The series has consistently dominated platform rankings, securing the #1 position on Qidian for consecutive months and ranking #1 in completed fantasy novels on Webnovel.Its success extends beyond the digital realm through successful transmedia adaptations, including an upcoming animated series (donghua), a mobile RPG, and print editions, further solidifying its market presence.The author's direct engagement with the expansive fandom has fostered a deeply invested community, while critical acclaim, including its prestigious inclusion in the National Library of China, underscores its cultural and literary significance. 



# Introduction to Lord of the Mysteries

# Overview of the Web Novel

*Lord of the Mysteries* (Chinese: 诡秘之主; pinyin: Guǐ Mì Zhī Zhǔ) is a highly acclaimed Chinese web novel penned by the author known as Cuttlefish That Loves Diving (爱潜水的乌贼).The novel was initially serialized on Qidian, a prominent online literature platform, from April 1, 2018, to May 1, 2020, captivating a rapidly growing audience during its original run.Following its digital success, print editions began publication through China Literature in 2020, making the extensive narrative accessible to a broader readership that prefers physical copies.The expansive narrative continues with a direct sequel titled 'The Circle of Inevitability,' further developing the rich universe established in the first series. 



A defining characteristic of *Lord of the Mysteries* is its masterful and innovative blend of diverse literary [genres.It](http://genres.It) seamlessly integrates elements of dark fantasy, Lovecraftian horror, steampunk, and xianxia, creating a unique narrative tapestry that defies easy categorization.Beyond these core genres, the story also incorporates aspects of isekai, where a protagonist is transported to another world, and a pervasive mystery element that drives much of the plot.This genre synthesis contributes significantly to its distinct appeal and broad readership.  



# Brief Synopsis and Unique Selling Points

The narrative of *Lord of the Mysteries* commences in the year 1349 of the Epoch Calendar, introducing Zhou Mingrui, a modern-day individual who finds himself transmigrated into the body of Klein Moretti, a university graduate in an alternate Victorian-era world.This meticulously crafted world presents a fascinating juxtaposition of advanced steam technology with potent occult forces and clandestine secret societies.Klein's journey begins as he joins the Nighthawks, a covert organization dedicated to combating supernatural threats. Through this affiliation, he gains access to the ""Gray Fog,"" a mysterious ethereal space that facilitates communication with other ""Beyonders""—individuals endowed with supernatural abilities.Adopting the formidable persona of ""Mr. Fool,"" Klein strategically establishes and leads the Tarot Club, a hidden collective where Beyonders can exchange vital information and rare potion ingredients, often inadvertently uncovering deeper, hidden dangers. 



The enduring popularity of *Lord of the Mysteries* can be attributed to several distinctive elements that set it apart in the crowded web novel landscape:

* **Rich and Complex World-building:** The novel is consistently lauded for its exceptionally intricate and detailed world-building, which reviewers describe as feeling genuinely ""lived in"".The author's commitment to authenticity is evident in the thorough research conducted to ensure historical accuracy for the Victorian-era setting, which provides a robust foundation for the fantastical elements.The seamless integration of diverse influences, such as Cthulhu mythology, SCP-like phenomena, Victorian aesthetics, and steampunk technology, culminates in a ""gigantic different world"" that manages to be both familiar in its historical echoes and refreshingly original in its fantastical execution, resonating with readers across various cultural backgrounds. 
* **Innovative Magic System:** The ""Beyonder"" power system, central to the narrative, is derived from the consumption of specialized potions. This system is considered highly unique and compelling due to its inherent Lovecraftian nature: while granting extraordinary abilities, gaining powers carries the profound risk of losing control and succumbing to madness, transforming into abominations.This perilous progression, detailed through 22 distinct ""Sequence 9"" potions, adds a layer of tension and consequence often absent in other fantasy narratives, making the characters' growth feel earned and precarious. 
* **Compelling Characterization:** The protagonist, Klein Moretti, is frequently highlighted as a remarkably well-developed character, praised for his realism, cautious demeanor, clear-headed rationality, and sympathetic portrayal as a ""tragic hero"".Unlike many typical isekai protagonists who gain overwhelming power quickly, Klein's power progression is deliberately slow and earned, emphasizing strategic thinking and gradual mastery over brute force.Furthermore, the narrative extends this depth to its supporting cast and even antagonists, who are consistently depicted with unique personalities, motivations, and ambitions, making them feel like ""real people"" rather than mere plot devices.Villains, in particular, are noted for their intelligence and unpredictability, posing genuine threats to Klein and his allies. 
* **Deep Philosophical Themes:** The novel transcends mere genre entertainment by delving into profound philosophical inquiries. It explores complex themes such as the inherent value of life, the meaning of existence, the nuanced distinction between good and evil, and the pervasive nature of moral ambiguity.These explorations often evoke strong emotional responses from readers, fostering a deeper connection to the narrative. The story also addresses universal human sentiments, including the ""pursuit for novelty, curiosity for suspense, and yearning for family affection, friendship and love,"" which are identified as crucial factors for its widespread recognition across diverse cultures.Additionally, the setting allows for the examination of pertinent social problems of the era, such as poverty, unemployment, and environmental pollution.

The novel has amassed a substantial global readership. As of 2023, *Lord of the Mysteries* had garnered ""tens of millions of readers"" worldwide, a testament to its widespread appeal. 



**Chinese Readership:** The series enjoys immense popularity within its country of origin. The Chinese audiobook version has achieved an astounding 1.2 billion views, accompanied by 1.3 million votes per month and 400 million plays, highlighting a significant engagement with audio adaptations.On Qidian, the primary serialization platform, the novel recorded 25 million hits and maintained an impressive rating of 4.8 out of 5 points.Anecdotal evidence from readers further underscores its deep penetration into Chinese society; one Chinese reader estimated that 15-30% of high schoolers in their region had read the novel, while another suggested an ""absurd"" figure of 80% of university students in China having read it.These figures collectively paint a picture of a pervasive cultural phenomenon within China.  



**English Readership (Webnovel):** For English-speaking audiences, the novel's official translation on Webnovel has accumulated 54.3 million views, with page views exceeding 24 million person times.While a Reddit user noted 42.6 million views on Webnovel, they also raised the pertinent question of whether this figure represents completed reads or merely partial engagement.Another online platform reportedly recorded approximately 58 million views for the series. 



# Ranking Performance on Major Web Novel Platforms

*Lord of the Mysteries* has consistently demonstrated strong performance on key web novel platforms, reflecting its sustained popularity.

**Qidian (China):** The novel achieved the #1 position on Qidian's popularity rankings for several consecutive months, a clear indicator of its dominance within the Chinese web novel market. 



**Webnovel (International English):** On Webnovel, the English edition holds the #1 position in terms of popularity among completed fantasy [novels.It](http://novels.It) also ranks as the #3 overall in popularity among all completed novels on the platform, showcasing its broad appeal across genres.Furthermore, it secures the #2 position in the Translations' Power Ranking, highlighting the success of its English localization. 



# Geographic Distribution of Readership and Official Translations

The widespread appeal of *Lord of the Mysteries* is evident in its large fandom spanning both Chinese and English-speaking audiences.Notably, the novel was serialized simultaneously in both Chinese and English, a rare undertaking for web novels.The series has also found significant success in other regions, with the Thai edition becoming a ""smash hit"" at the Bangkok International Book Fair, indicating robust demand in Southeast Asia. 



A closer examination of the translation landscape reveals a specific dynamic. While the global success and ""multi-language charm"" of the series are apparent, particularly with the success of the Thai edition, the digital web novel translation is predominantly singular. Reports indicate that ""There is only one translation of Lord of the Mysteries. The Webnovel version. Every other site is pirating that version"".This suggests that while the official digital translation channel is limited, the compelling nature of the narrative and its world-building generates substantial organic demand internationally. This demand is then met through various channels, including unofficial fan translations or pirated versions, which proliferate due to the limited official digital availability. The existence of a successful Thai *print edition* and the upcoming English *print edition* by Yen On further illustrate that while the *web novel's official digital translation* is concentrated, licensed print or other media translations are being pursued in specific international markets to capture this grassroots interest.This demonstrates the inherent strength of the intellectual property, compelling various forms of engagement even where official digital translations are scarce.  



Another significant factor influencing readership distribution and engagement is the pricing structure across platforms. The complete series on Qidian (the Chinese platform) is priced at approximately \~$30. In stark contrast, the same content on Webnovel (the English platform) can easily cost over $300 if users do not strategically utilize reward systems.This substantial tenfold price disparity between the Chinese and English versions of the same content presents a considerable economic barrier for many international readers. This pricing difference inadvertently incentivizes readers to seek out alternative, unofficial, or pirated sources for the English translation. If the official version is perceived as prohibitively expensive, readers, particularly those in regions with varying economic contexts, are more likely to gravitate towards free or significantly cheaper alternatives. While Webnovel aims to monetize the English translation, this pricing approach may inadvertently limit its market penetration and divert a substantial portion of its potential paying audience towards unofficial channels. A more aligned or regionally adjusted pricing model could potentially convert more readers who currently access pirated content into official subscribers, thereby enhancing legitimate revenue and engagement.

# Fandom Engagement & Community Dynamics

The popularity of *Lord of the Mysteries* is profoundly amplified by its exceptionally active and dedicated fandom, which plays a crucial role in sustaining its cultural footprint.

# Author's Interaction with the Fandom

A distinctive aspect of *Lord of the Mysteries*'s success lies in the author's, Cuttlefish That Loves Diving, proactive and direct engagement with the fanbase. The author frequently participated in online discussions, particularly those centered around fan theories concerning the protagonist and his abilities.This engagement was not merely superficial; the author sometimes confirmed fan speculation, redirected discussions, and, notably, incorporated reader feedback directly into future installments of the series. 



This unique practice of direct authorial engagement and the willingness to integrate reader feedback created a dynamic and highly invested fanbase. This direct interaction fosters a profound sense of co-creation and community ownership, making readers feel heard and valued, which in turn significantly deepens their loyalty and commitment to the series. This goes beyond simple fan service; it establishes a powerful feedback loop.

This constant intellectual stimulation keeps the community vibrant and active, driving sustained discussion, organic promotion, and continuous refinement of the story based on audience reception, ultimately enhancing its overall quality and resonance. In the context of web novels, where serialization is an ongoing process, this model of direct, responsive author engagement provides a significant competitive advantage. It transforms passive consumption into active participation, cultivating a self-sustaining ecosystem of content creation (through theories and discussions) and quality enhancement, which is invaluable for the long-term growth and retention of the intellectual property.

# Fan Theory Discussions and Fan-Created Content

The intricate plot and deep lore of *Lord of the Mysteries* naturally encourage a highly engaged and speculative fandom. Fans frequently engage in extensive discussions about fan theories regarding the protagonist and his abilities, showcasing the intellectual depth and analytical engagement the series inspires.This collective theorizing is a significant driver of sustained interest and community activity.  



The community's creative output is further evidenced by the existence of a ""Lord of Mysteries Fanon Wiki"" on Fandom.This collaborative platform allows fans to contribute their own original stories, characters, and even ""new pathways"" within the established LotM universe, demonstrating a high degree of creative investment and expansion of the IP.Additionally, numerous Pinterest boards dedicated to *Lord of the Mysteries* are replete with fan art and related interests, illustrating a vibrant visual fandom and the extensive creative content generated organically by the community. 



# Offline Fan Activities and Community Size

The popularity of *Lord of the Mysteries* in China transcends digital platforms, manifesting in tangible cultural elements that demonstrate its deep integration into daily life and commercial spaces. This includes train station doors decorated with LotM signs and dedicated LotM coffee shops, indicating a pervasive presence in public consciousness. 



Perhaps the most striking demonstration of the fandom's scale and passion is the occurrence of large-scale, real-world fan events. A remarkable fandom meet-up was reportedly held in an actual castle in China, attracting an estimated 40,000 people who attended in cosplay.This event exemplifies an exceptionally organized and passionate community capable of mobilizing a massive gathering, showcasing the profound depth of fan dedication.  



Online, the official subreddit, r/LordofTheMysteries, serves as a highly active hub for discussions, memes, and fan content, boasting over 33,000 members.A dedicated Discord server, linked from the subreddit, provides another platform for real-time community interaction and discussion. 



The transition from online readership to large-scale, real-world cultural manifestations—such as themed merchandise, dedicated commercial spaces, and massive cosplay events—signifies that *Lord of the Mysteries* has evolved beyond a popular web novel into a significant cultural phenomenon, particularly within China.This level of organic, community-driven cultural integration is a powerful indicator of sustained popularity and intellectual property value. It suggests that the IP's themes, characters, and world resonate deeply enough to inspire significant personal investment and collective action from its fanbase. This self-propelling cultural phenomenon acts as an incredibly potent, organic marketing engine, generating continuous buzz, attracting new fans through real-world exposure, and creating additional avenues for monetization, such as merchandise sales and event sponsorships. This level of community vitality is a critical asset for the long-term growth and resilience of the intellectual property.  



# IP Expansion & Transmedia Adaptations

The sustained popularity of *Lord of the Mysteries* has naturally led to its expansion across various media, transforming it into a multifaceted entertainment franchise.

# Overview of Animated Adaptations (Donghua)

An animated adaptation, known as a donghua, of *Lord of the Mysteries* is a highly anticipated project, scheduled for release in June/July 2025.This production is backed by Tencent, a prominent multinational company, and animated by B.CMAY PICTURES, a studio renowned for its ""exceptional adaptations"" and ""fluid and dynamic animation"" in previous works like *The King's Avatar* and *Master of Diabolism*.A crucial aspect for the dedicated fanbase is the author, Cuttlefish That Loves Diving, maintaining direct involvement in the project, ensuring a faithful and accurate adaptation of the beloved source material. 



The first season of the donghua is slated to adapt the entirety of the first novel, comprising 13 main episodes and two special episodes, each running approximately 30 minutes.Initial distribution will be limited to Chinese/Mandarin language on Tencent Videos and Weibo. Future Western distribution on platforms like Crunchyroll is contingent on growing popularity, indicating a phased global expansion strategy.The production encountered a ""temporary setback regarding some of its later episodes"" due to Chinese censorship concerning ""graphic content,"" but has since received clearance, paving the way for its release. 



The significant investment in the donghua, characterized by the involvement of a major studio, Tencent's backing, and the author's direct participation, signals a clear strategy to solidify the intellectual property's dominance within the Chinese market first, leveraging its immense existing fanbase there.This approach represents a low-risk, high-reward strategy given the astronomical pre-existing audience in China. However, the initial limited international distribution, with Western traction dependent on future contracting to other outlets, suggests a cautious, reactive global expansion rather than an immediate worldwide launch.This approach could potentially delay the capture of the full international market potential and might inadvertently encourage international fans to seek unofficial viewing channels. While the donghua is poised for significant domestic success, a more assertive and immediate international distribution strategy would likely be beneficial to capitalize on the existing international fanbase and prevent fragmentation of viewership, thereby maximizing global impact.  



# Development of Video Games (RPG)

Further diversifying the intellectual property's reach, a mobile RPG titled ""Code:Mystery"" is currently in active development as of 2024, utilizing the advanced Unreal Engine 5. 



The development of a high-fidelity mobile RPG demonstrates a strategic move to expand the intellectual property's engagement beyond traditional narrative consumption into interactive media. This initiative aims to capture the massive global gaming audience, particularly within the mobile sector, which includes individuals who may not typically engage with web novels or donghua. The choice to use Unreal Engine 5 signals a commitment to producing a high-quality visual and gameplay experience, which is crucial for attracting and retaining gamers in a highly competitive market. This adaptation is a key step in transforming *Lord of the Mysteries* into a truly multi-faceted entertainment franchise. It creates a new, interactive entry point for the intellectual property, with the potential to convert gamers into readers or viewers, and vice versa, thereby strengthening the overall intellectual property ecosystem and diversifying revenue streams.

# Print Publication Status and International Distribution

In addition to its digital serialization, *Lord of the Mysteries* is also available in traditional print formats.Volume 1, ""The Clown, Part I,"" is officially published in English by Yen On, with a publication date set for July 22, 2025.This print edition is substantial, spanning 580 pages, offering a comprehensive physical reading experience.Early Amazon rankings for the English print edition show promising performance, securing #13,910 in Books overall, #67 in Asian Myth & Legend, and #419 in Action & Adventure Fantasy, indicating a strong initial reception in traditional book markets. 



The novel has also achieved significant success in other print markets, notably with the Thai edition, which was a ""smash hit"" at the Bangkok International Book [Fair.To](http://Fair.To) meet the high demand, a rapid publication schedule was established, with one volume released every 20 days. 



The expansion into official print editions, particularly in English and other languages like Thai, signifies a strategic move to legitimize the intellectual property within traditional publishing channels and reach a broader audience that prefers physical books.This also serves as a crucial measure to combat piracy by providing a high-quality, officially licensed alternative to the widespread unofficial versions. Official print editions lend an air of legitimacy and permanence to the intellectual property, transitioning it beyond its ""web novel"" origins. Furthermore, offering high-quality official print versions can directly counter the prevalence of pirated content, providing dedicated fans a legitimate avenue to support the author and the series. This multi-format release strategy maximizes market penetration and diversifies revenue streams. It demonstrates a comprehensive approach to intellectual property management, ensuring that *Lord of the Mysteries* is accessible across various consumer preferences and solidifying its presence in the global publishing landscape.

# Factors Driving Sustained Popularity

The enduring and expanding popularity of *Lord of the Mysteries* can be attributed to a confluence of compelling factors that resonate deeply with a diverse global audience.

# Unique Genre Blend and Rich Lore

The novel's innovative fusion of dark fantasy, Lovecraftian horror, steampunk, and xianxia is a primary driver of its appeal.This blend offers a ""fresh take"" on established genres, attracting readers who seek novel and complex narratives that transcend conventional boundaries.The ""fantastic, unique"" and ""rich and complex"" world-building, meticulously researched to ensure historical accuracy for its Victorian-era setting, creates a deeply immersive and believable universe that feels genuinely ""lived in"".The well-conceived and inherently dangerous ""Beyonder"" power system, where abilities come with the risk of madness and transformation, adds a layer of profound consequence and intrigue that distinguishes it from more straightforward power progression fantasies. 



# Compelling Narrative and Character Depth

The story's ability to engage readers on multiple levels is another critical factor. The narrative is characterized by a ""very convoluted"" yet ""extremely well written"" plot, featuring ""great mysteries and great plot twists"" that keep readers consistently invested.While the pacing is initially ""slow,"" it gradually deepens and becomes more intricate, rewarding patient readers with a rich, unfolding tapestry of events.The author's skill in embedding meaningful information even in seemingly minor chapters contributes to a consistent and deeply satisfying plot, where every detail can become significant. 



Central to its appeal is the exceptional characterization. The protagonist, Klein Moretti, is lauded as a realistic, sympathetic, and cautious ""tragic hero"" whose slow and earned power progression makes him relatable and his journey compelling.Beyond Klein, the supporting cast and even antagonists are developed with remarkable depth, possessing unique personalities and motivations that make them feel like ""real people"".This commitment to character realism ensures that readers form strong emotional connections, a sentiment frequently expressed in reviews. 



# Thematic Resonance and Cultural Accessibility

*Lord of the Mysteries* delves into profound philosophical and thematic questions, such as the value of life, the nature of good and evil, and moral ambiguity, often eliciting strong emotional responses from its audience.Its exploration of universal human sentiments—including the ""pursuit for novelty, curiosity for suspense, and yearning for family affection, friendship and love""—is a key reason for its wide recognition across diverse cultures.The novel's ability to merge oriental culture and thought into a global context, while depicting social problems like poverty and unemployment in its Victorian-era setting, ensures its story and spirit are universally relatable.This cross-cultural accessibility allows the narrative to touch readers regardless of their background, fostering a broad and dedicated international following.  



# Conclusions

*Lord of the Mysteries* has solidified its position as a globally significant intellectual property, demonstrating a multi-faceted popularity driven by both quantitative market dominance and profound qualitative appeal. Its journey from a Chinese web novel to a transmedia phenomenon is a testament to its compelling narrative, innovative world-building, and deeply resonant characters.

The analysis reveals an extraordinary level of engagement within China, evidenced by billions of audiobook views and widespread readership among youth, indicating deep cultural integration.Internationally, while the official digital translation is primarily singular, the significant views on platforms like Webnovel and the success of localized print editions in markets such as Thailand underscore a substantial global appetite for the series.The notable pricing disparity between Chinese and English platforms presents a challenge, likely contributing to the prevalence of unofficial translations, which the expansion into official print editions and diverse media adaptations can help mitigate. 



The consistent critical acclaim for its unique genre blend, intricate plot, and exceptional character depth underpins its sustained appeal.Furthermore, the novel's recognition by prestigious Chinese literary institutions elevates its status beyond mere commercial success, positioning it as a cultural benchmark and a trendsetter in online literature.The author's proactive engagement with the fandom, incorporating reader feedback into the narrative, has cultivated an exceptionally loyal and active community, fostering a powerful feedback loop that fuels continuous discussion and organic growth.This vibrant fandom extends into real-world manifestations, from themed commercial spaces to large-scale cosplay events, signifying the IP's evolution into a self-propelling cultural phenomenon. 



The strategic expansion into transmedia, including a high-profile animated series backed by Tencent and a mobile RPG utilizing Unreal Engine 5, signifies a comprehensive approach to maximizing the IP's reach and revenue streams.These adaptations are poised to introduce *Lord of the Mysteries* to new audiences, particularly within the gaming and animation communities, further cementing its status as a leading global entertainment franchise. The ongoing development across these diverse platforms indicates a robust future for *Lord of the Mysteries*, promising continued growth and sustained influence in the global entertainment landscape.

So it got me thinking: do people actually wear their engagement ring and wedding band ALL THE TIME? Or is it more like, any time you go out you make sure to wear it?

I am looking making new friends, if you find interesting, message me.

I enjoy cooking for peace of mind, used to like hiking trips(looking forward to resuming this hobby). I enjoy swimming and taking long walks. I try to survive this life with coffee. I sometimes watch/re-watch anime , or listen to audiobooks or useless podcasts in weekends to pass time. Exploring new food/cuisine excites me more than watching a movie.

I currently don't have any pets, but love to adopt a cat some day.

I enjoy cooking as a hobby , I'm definitely not a professional. But I got into it as it reminds me of self value and consistently put efforts to improve myself. It's ok if it sounds a bit boring, but this particular hobby helped me a lot with my anxiety issues and making a routine.

Just for starting conversations, I am writing these questions, feel free to ask me anything that fancies ya.

Since I began getting exams, almost all of my Pap smears have all been abnormal. The response I received from my past Drs was to wait a year until the next exam with the expectation that the result would return as normal. I was also told getting the gardisil shot would help prevent HPV symptoms from progressing, so I did. Fast forward to February of this year, I received abnormal results from my PCP. She was aware that this was not my 1st, 2nd nor 3rd abnormal result. I had been diagnosed with HPV 16. She immediately recommended I be seen for a colposcopy and discussed what would come after should anything abnormal be found. It was my first time hearing of such an exam and I was filled with anxiety when she explained what the cone procedure was. Although I was highly anxious, I knew it had to be done. I got the colposcopy on April 16th and received the results of the biopsy the following week. I had CIN2, midgrade precancerous cells. This sent me. I did not want to sacrifice my fertility and ability to carry since I do not have children and desire them in the future. At the same time, I did not want to allow the cells to progress to cancer and possibly lose my life. I was booked to get the LEEP procedure on May 21. The worst part of the procedure for me was the numbing. I felt the needle in my cervix and anus(possibly due to proximity and some nerve damage), I was instantly in tears. Thankfully my mom, the Dr, and nurse were all there to hold my hand and talk me through it. After I was numbed, everything was super smooth and I didn’t feel a thing besides my legs shaking the entire time. Me being a biology nerd, I was curious and asked to see what the removed portion looked like. It looked BIG. And it was only 1 of 3 pieces that had been excised. It triggered me a bit and I was an emotional crying wreck once I got in the car with my parents. Today is day 2 post-op for me. I also started my cycle, what a joy 😒 I have already passed the coffee grounds stage and the “scab”, it looked awful!!! It made me cry hysterically for about 10 minutes but once I was able to calm down, I had to tell myself that my body is healing from a traumatic event and to show myself some grace for being brave enough to go through with it. I am waiting to hear the results of the LEEP biopsy, I’m praying for clear margins and acknowledgment that all of the cells were removed! 

I hope my story can speak to someone who may feel dismissed by your healthcare provider. 

Stay healthy ladies, and stay up on your Pap smears! A don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself if you feel that Drs are not taking your concerns seriously.  And get that heating pad for post op, it truly helps to ease the cramping!",3,1748064853.0,PreCervicalCancer,0,1.0,False

Had a long list of things to buy — washing machine, dishwasher, chimney, microwave, oven, fob, the whole damn package. Thought I’d be smart and do it all in one go by checking out *Croma* and *Vijay Sales*. BIG mistake.

From the moment I walked in, it was a complete disaster.

1. **Step one: enter store. Step two: wait for someone to give a crap.** You literally have to *chase* someone down to even get a “Can I help you?” And when you finally do, they don’t even stick around — they just throw you at another section like a hot potato. You go there, and guess what? Nobody’s there either. Just you, standing around like a moron, while people in uniforms walk by pretending you don’t exist.
2. **When someone** ***finally*** **shows up**, they can’t be bothered to explain *anything*. No effort to understand what you need, no suggestions, no guidance — just, “This model’s there,” “That model’s also there.” What the hell, man? I’m not here window-shopping. I’m ready to drop serious money — maybe help me make an informed choice?
3. **And here’s the kicker:** I was ready to make a *bulk* purchase — but not *one damn person* thought it made sense to take my number? Not even a “Sir, can I call you with more options?” Just blank stares and vibes. I’ve seen more enthusiasm from parking attendants.
4. Meanwhile, there are a dozen staff members floating around like they’re on a picnic — glued to their phones, watching reels, chatting in corners like they’re on a coffee break. And if they *are* standing near the products, they’re too busy gossiping with each other to notice a paying customer trying to get their attention.

And the cherry on top? **Most models on display are outdated junk.** And then they try to *upsell you models that aren’t even on display*. I’m sorry, you want me to *blind-buy* something I can’t even *see* in your so-called “showroom”? The audacity.

It’s honestly depressing how bad the state of offline retail has become. I *used* to be someone who preferred buying big-ticket items offline just to avoid delivery screw-ups and returns. But if this is the kind of “service” I get, then screw it — I totally understand why everyone’s ditching these stores and going online.

If anyone knows a store — *any store* — where people actually do their bloody job, help you out, and don’t act like they’re doing you a favor, PLEASE tell me. I’m done wasting my time and energy on these clueless clowns.

Back in the halls of Berklee College of Music—where dreams are forged in 9/8 time signatures and nobody has ever heard a four-chord pop song—there walked a quiet figure. Long hair, a flute case, and the unmistakable aura of someone who ate rice silently in the corner of every dorm potluck. His name was John Myung.

John wasn’t like the other kids at Berklee. While they wore Megadeth shirts and played guitar with their teeth, John was there on a flute scholarship. A flute. That’s right—this future prog-metal icon was halfway through his transition… into becoming a ladyboy. Not emotionally, not physically, but spiritually. The long hair wasn’t metal—it was Thai pageant chic.

One fateful Tuesday, as John quietly rehearsed Mozart in the common room, a bass guitar—not his—leaned against the wall beside him. Enter two chaos goblins of musical mayhem: John Petrucci, the biceps bard, and Mike Portnoy, the caffeine-powered octopus with sticks for hands. They stopped mid-stride, spotting John with his delicate features, serene vibe, and most importantly… the hair.

Petrucci leaned in, squinting like a prophet spotting destiny.
“Yo. Do you play bass?”
Myung froze. His brain screamed: ‘Say no, John! Say no and run!’ But his mouth, in a panicked attempt to be cool, blurted,
“Yeah… I, uh… slap sometimes.”

Mike Portnoy, holding a coffee in one hand and three drumsticks in the other (one of which was lodged in his beard), nodded approvingly. “Nice. You into metal?”
John’s parents hadn’t even let him listen to Queen. But he stood tall.
“Yeah. Totally. Big fan of… uh… Metallic—an?”

They bought it.

The boys invited him to jam. John ran to the nearest pawn shop, traded in his flute, his rice cooker, and an unopened box of Gundam figurines, and bought a bass. He spent the next 72 hours practicing every note ever written. Being Asian, he instinctively learned bass by meditating under a waterfall while slapping eighth notes into the mist.

The jam session came. John was terrified. His hands trembled, but he channeled every ounce of anime protagonist determination and held his own. Petrucci and Portnoy nodded in approval. They liked him.

John kept showing up, each time silently dreading the moment they’d figure it out. That he was never meant to be their bassist. That he was a flute boy. A fraud. But every session, he got better. Sharper. Quicker.

Time passed. Dream Theater was born. Albums were made. Solos were played in time signatures that gave normal people vertigo. And through it all, John Myung said maybe eight words total.

People always assumed he was quiet because he was deep. Mysterious. Zen.
But truthfully, he just lived in fear that one day, during rehearsal, Mike would stop mid-song, point at him and shout:

“WAIT A MINUTE. YOU’RE NOT EVEN A BASSIST!”

But that day never came.

And so, John Myung—flute prodigy, accidental bassist, and progressive metal’s quietest overachiever—slaps on. Silently. Brilliantly. Hiding in plain sight.",1,1748064114.0,Dreamtheater,0,1.0,False

Apologies as this is going to be a long one....

I moved to the USA a few years ago with my partner from England. I found out he had been cheating so I ended that relationship. I left that relationship with literally nothing apart from some personal belongings, we were having a house built together which was in both of our names (name on land and deeds).  I was friends with a US citizen who I've known since I moved here. We ended up getting into a romantic relationship and he moved me in. He knew my ex and my situation. We decided early on to get married. The connection was amazing, he was generous and said he would pay for everything and I can start saving for a vehicle.

We had an amazing summer together, he introduced me to all of his friends, let me use his vehicle to get to and from work and told me I could all throughout the summer and then in the winter it would be going into storage, was an amazing partner and it all seemed like a dream. We even booked a trip to Maui for January 2025. We even flew back to the UK so he could ask my Dad for my hand in marriage, I paid for the flights for us to return to my home as I felt he had been great with him letting me move into his home.

I noticed a few red flags before our vacation to England. Jealousy around me talking to members of the opposite sex, and there were comments on me wearing makeup and who was I doing it for and trying to impress etc and he said he would prefer it if I did not wear it.

Fast forward to our trip to England, that was amazing. My parents liked him and were pleased I was getting married. When we returned home, things were still going well. He proposed and we got married in August of 2024. This is when things began to change. I applied for my visa to obtain my green card through marriage. I completed all the paperwork solely by myself with no help from my husband and paid for it all my self too. Please keep in mind in this time I am supposed to be saving for a vehicle too, with the limited funds I had due to the only job I could get without work authorization. So paying out for filing the paperwork wiped out most of what I had saved. My husband said this was fine and whatever I had saved he would make up the rest.

Fast forward a week later, he asks how much I have saved, is not happy with that amount and tells me I should have more. I ended up selling a designer watch and necklace so I would have more funds. We are now in November and the weather is starting to get colder, he asks how much money I have as the vehicle is now going into storage and there is snow on the ground. Considering the money I had just laid out for the visa I did not have as much as he wanted me too. This resulted in him putting the vehicle into storage and leaving me with no vehicle at all. He agreed to contribute with me or even suggested getting a loan. Now he had changed his mind, would not help me at all and proceeded to tell me he felt used and that I was taking advantage of him. He tells me he wants to separate and start seeing other people, however we are still married. I continue to stay in our bedroom but on his terms we are separated, he would go out to the bat without me and leave me at home, he said he was not going to pay for me anymore, and that this was fault for not saving enough for a vehicle, even though there was never an agreed amount I would need to have saved that was acceptable to him. So now the job that I do have colleagues that I am working with are picking me up and I am giving them gas money.

Fast forward a couple of months and he seems to have ""forgiven"" me for this and goes back and forth between being with me and then waiting to separate. I've Thanksgiving he leaves me at home and goes on one of his many trips to the bar and does not return until 4am. My friend messaged me who was at the bat with me to ask me what is going on, he overheard my husband bad mouthing me, calling me a leech and saying how he wants to get an annulment. He ends up going back to my friends house, with my friends ex girlfriend and .u shuabnd gets into a hot tub with her naked. Then he comes home to me as of nothing has happened, obviously not knowing that I know. And when i did confront it, his argument and justification was that we were separated so it was okay. Along with the separations, criticisms, name calling and belittling have also started. Everything that I was previously praised for is now an issue. Everything I do is wrong. I am labeled as stupid, incapable retarded, a dud of a wife and I being told I have done nothing with my life. This is just naming of a few of things that were said.

Our trip to Maui is coming up, and he says maybe this will be a good way to rekindle our relationship, even though we were going with another couple and another one of our friends we were treating it as a honeymoon. So we go on the trip, the first couple of days are great. He is telling me he can see the effort I am making (I had just received my work authorization before our trip) applying for jobs etc..  and that he was falling in love with me all over again. A couple of days later we go on a boat trip and there was an open bar so quite a lot of alcohol was consumed. We get back to our room a bit later a he apologizes for the last few months and being distant and so hard on me, we had not spoken about the hot tub incident, so I bought that up and he lost it, how dare I bring that up on vacation, how nothing happened anyway even though he was named. And said in hindsight he should have just had sex with her. The next morning he proceeds to tell me he is going to fly home as I am selfish for bringing up the hot tub scenario. He threatens to leave me there and he is going to tell our friends at breakfast that he is flying home, this never happens and the vacation continues. However later on that evening I am concerned by my husbands behavior, the name calling hasn't stopped, and that that morning he was threatening to fly home. Obviously things have not been great for a few months, there has been added Jealousy and accusations of me cheating with no proof and lots of control where my phone is concerned. So that night I reach out to my Mum back in England, I am talking to her about the possibility of returning home, I am clearly acknowledging that I am in an emotionally abusive relationship so I am venting to her, and asking what she thinks I should do. Later on we go to bed and my husband asks to see my phone, he wants to check it to prove I am not cheating, he said I had been on it for a while and who am I talking to? So I told him I was having a private conversation with My Mum, he demands to see my phone as he does not believe me. I said as his wife he should trust me and in this instance give me privacy, and he has checked my phone in the past for the same reason and never found anything. I then go out of the room to call my Mum as I am concerned. I return to our room and tell him we need to talk.  He tells me to fuck off and rolls over and goes to sleep. The next morning I say to him if it help ease your mind please take my phone, I tell him I was venting to my Mum and did not want to make him angry. He said our marriage is over and there should be no private conversation between my Mum and I that he cannot read. He says he no longer wants to see my phone, and that our marriage is over, he then took my phone and threw it across the room. He then said when we return home that he will move me into the spare room and I will start paying him rent. 

The rest of the vacation goes by semi smoothly. There is more name calling. He rated me a 1.4 out of ten. He said that he should pay our friend that was on vacation with $1,000 to sleep with me so that he could get me away from him. I beginning to become very scared of him at this point, he is bad mouthing me to our friends and becoming more nasty. I can feel the cortisol levels rising, I am visibly shaking where my brain is in flight or fight and he is mocking me. I had to get out of the apartment we were staying in, so I took myself down to the beach one morning in a complete state of panic, I have been in an abusive relationship before and I could feel it escalating. In my panicked state I did something I know regret, I reached out to my ex in from England who still resides in the USA, he is the only other person I know from my home country and I was scared. We had been in touch since my new relationship as we still had Financials that we needed to sort out, we had been negotiating that back and forth and it wasn't getting us anywhere, he then began to get personal with it and threaten me with calling immigration due to getting married etc... Anyway at the time even though our relationship did not end amicably and we had not spoken for a while as the negoations had stopped I still phoned him. I was not sure whether to fly back to England at this point of fly back early to the US. He calmed me down and said he would help me, I did not speak to him again while on vacation, it was a moment of me feeling completely overwhelmed and panicked.

We flew home a few days later. And true to his word my husband kicked me out of our room and made me stay in spare room and pay  rent, he said if I didn't make the dates or disagreed with having to do this (as his wife!) that he would have me evicted. I was panicking again at this point. He was going out again and leaving me at home. Threatening to bring other women home in an attempt to get me to leave the home. He said he would bring them home and make sure to have sex with them loudly so I could hear it. He said that he wanted a divorce and if I even dared to go back to England he would hunt me down and my family. He said all I was good for now was to be his f*cktoy and to be used a pincushion as that was all I was good for. I am devastated at this point, I do not want a divorce and I am begging him to reconcile and asking what I can do to make this right and that I will do anything. A few days later he comes home and goes on one of his rants telling me the same stuff he has been for nights on end with it always ending on him no longer wanted to be with me. At the end of this particular tirade it is 2.30am, and he said okay if you will do anything go and get your phone. I want to take it for 12 hours, change the passcode, you can go to work and then go through it together. I say no, this was a very controlling and intrusive ask. And he was asking to rebuild trust when none had been broken and it was purely on his assumptions and insecurities. Him keep looking through my phone is not going to achieve anything. He goes to bed and told me that was my last chance at redeeming anything with him. The next day he is sending me disgusting text messages while in his room and I am in mine, saying how we wants me to leave the home and it needs to happen quickly. He then proceeds to call my Mum in England and asks her how he can get me out of his home. A few days later he goes on a skiing vacation with his friend. I am on my own at this point, still with no vehicle and no way to get to work. My boss has said because of where we lived it was becoming an inconvenience for my colleagues to come out of their way to pick me up. My husband had also called my boss, and he was the one that got me that job as they were good friends. Just a side note I had confided in her with what was happening between my husband and I, not ever did I bad mouth him, I was just looking for some advice as I was scared for my future. And wanted a females perspective of someone who had known him a long time. She was very much on my side and could not believe how he was treating me. However after he called her things dramatically changed and she confessed to him that I had confided in her that he was calling me names etc.. anyway after that phone call and while he was on vacation she ended up letting me go. So now I am in the spare room, mu husband is on vacation so I am on my own, I am being threatened with eviction and divorce and being called names on a daily basis. I have now reached breaking point so I voluntarily took myself into hospital. My husband finds out and accuses me of trying to ruin his vacation calls me a f*king asshole and tells me I am not welcome back into his home. While I'm in hospital again I reach back out to my ex from England and explain your him that we have Financials that need to be taken care of and I need to sign off ASAP as my husband is kicking me out of our home. My ex is supportive and even arranges for me to stay with a friend when I am discharged from hospital.

My husband returns off vacation and comes to visit me once while I'm in hospital, but not because he is concerned but because he wants to tell me how i ruined his vacation and how selfish I am being. A few days later he comes to pick me up, still no concern. He tells me he cannot wait for me to be out of his home. He doesn't care where I am going. He just wants me gone. So he kicks me out, I have most of my belongings in the garage still and he tells me I have a week to collect said belonging or he'll burn them or send them to goodwill. The first night I am staying at my friend's, the first night I have been kicked out but also just landed a new job i call him, tell him I do want any of this and just want to come home as I miss him. He tells me he's out at the bar, it's too cold outside to talk to me right now and that he will call me back tomorrow. At this point I am angry the realization that he's kicked me out, which is illegal in the state that we reside, I am an immigrant and he does not care at all or want to support me. He attempts to call me the next day, I do not answer as I am so upset and angry with his actions. I then recieve paragraphs of messages, telling me how useless I am, that I have had 9 months to prove myself to him and have not done that. If he was to ever consider me continuing to be his wife that I would have to pull my head out of my ass and start acting like one. He called me a six year old child, said all I was good for is sex, called me a lying cheater and the list goes on. This goes on for a week, more insults and out downs. Still threats of divorce and revoking his sponsorship for a greencard. The messages are becoming more threatening as the week goes on and as he has not heard from me he blocks me. I contact the sheriff's department at this point and ask for a civil standby. This makes my husband very angry and he asks why I'm telling our whole town that he is physically abusive and why I am in the fear for my life and telling the sheriff's that. I have never called him physically abusive and never told the sheriff's I was in fear for my life. I wanted a civil standby simply because I did not want to encounter anymore verbal abuse from him. He had progressed to throwing my phone again and attempted to throw a sharpie at me which missed, so things did begin to escalate. Not for one minute did I think he would be physical with me though and that is not why I asked for a civil standby on the day that I went to get my stuff I even said to him that maybe I had overreacted and I would come and get my stuff without them, he said no at that we should just keep to that arrangement. I got my belongings and when I arrived back at my friend's house he had sent messages to let me know he was going to file for divorce, revoke his sponsorship with USCIS and have me deported. Staying with my friend was only a short term arrangement and because of my husband's behavior I spoke to a DV shelter and they said I was definitely eligible to stay there. I ended up staying there for 3 weeks. All the while my husband did not know where I was. He was not concerned for my safety or whereabouts but he was just trying to track me down to serve me divorce papers. He was sending my friend who I had been staying with threats, my ex and other friends threatening and demanding messages to try and locate me. He also had people looking for me around the town we lived in. 

When I left the shelter I came to a friend's house where I still reside now. 

He then sent me this message after I had been there for a couple of weeks

Tic toc Leanne. Make good choices. Or maybe I call ice and show them your hezubla dedication and antisemitic stuff? Trump loves a good terrorist. 

I see why that guy beat you, tortured you, and treated you the way he did. You deserved it. My only wish is he did it more and harder. You deserve everything you get. 🚨🖕🚨🖕🚨👋👋👋

This obviously really scared me, and at this point I had not spoken to him for over a month and a half, as all his messages were of a threatening nature and I had realized quite a few of his tendencies were narcissistic and the best way to deal with that is to go no contact. However that above message made me take action and reach out to a mutual friend as a mediator. My husband and I began talking again. Because I am trauma bonded still I am still begging for him back and asking to come home etc.. he obviously blames me for everything, does not take accountability for his actions and words and says it was all truths and things that I needed to hear and that we meant every word and had no regrets regarding kicking me out. We however agree to meet for dinner, he says I need to pay now and going forward if there is more dates I need to pay for all of those too and earn back his love and trust. Then he changes his mind and says he just wants to meet in for coffee instead. He tells me he is scared of me!?! When I am the one that should be scared! He asks me not to kill him when we meet up! Fast forward to our meeting and it goes well. He just discuss day to day things. 

We carry on messaging and he tells me if we are to make a go of anything we need to be friends first which is obviously not plausible given the fact we are married and in my opinion you either want to try and reconcile or you don't. We agree to meet for a second time for coffee again. We have been messaging between these meetings and he still blames me for everything, and the breakdown of our marriage is because of me. I ask him to please reconsider our marriage and trying to make it work. Anyway I arrive at the coffee shop and there is a guy at the counter that I recognize instantly as the process server as I knew who he was. My husband arrives a few minutes later and I ask him if he is going to serve me which he tells me yes. I get emotional and ask him not to do it. Again he starts blaming me, he said the reason I kicked you out was because you kept begging for another chance and reconciliation and that I was still doing that and nothing had changed so that's why he was proceeding with the divorce. We then left but said he would call me later, we spoke on the phone for another hour. We texted for a while after that with me still trying to get him to reconsider. He then just stopped texting. Then a few days okay he messages asking me if I am okay as he has not heard from me?!? I reply a day later, asking him if he saw a way forward now that he had served divorce papers, and did he feel better about things because I am. He has not responded and that was yesterday. I know that he is seeing someone else who is also going through a divorce and that they have been seeing each other for a few months and were even seeing each other when I was still in the spare room.

I have signed off with my ex partner on the land and the deeds so I have at least gone some money and savings behind me. I have an attorney that is going to help me with a VAWA case and I have been told me case is very strong. I also received an interview for my greencard for marriage which I have rescheduled for now and will obviously put a hold on as I am now changing my status again. I am sorry this is so long.

1ku3wk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1ku3wk5/three_week_update_morning_sunlight_has_changed/,Three Week Update: Morning Sunlight has Changed Everything!!,"Three weeks ago, I posted here about wanting to try something new: getting morning sunlight within 10–15 minutes of waking up. The post absolutely blew up. At the time, I was feeling pretty scattered. I had a bad habit of starting my day on autopilot, immediately reaching for my phone, and losing 30–60 minutes to mindless scrolling. I didn’t feel grounded. I was waking up groggy, staying up too late, and just going through the motions.

The advice I kept seeing in books, podcasts, and random Reddit comments was surprisingly consistent: get outside first thing in the morning and let natural light hit your eyes. It sounded simple enough, so I gave myself a challenge. Just try it every morning for three weeks. No pressure to be perfect, but try to stay consistent.

So here I am, 21 days later, and I’ve actually stuck with it. Every single morning. Some days I go for a walk, some days I just stand on the balcony with a coffee. If it’s sunny, I get about 5–10 minutes of direct light. I've consistently used that app to take a pic of the sun so I can only access Reddit and stuff once I've hit my sunlight session for the morning. If it’s cloudy, I still go out and let the brightness hit my face. I leave my phone inside. No music, no distractions. Just stillness.

It’s hard to describe exactly how it’s helped, but I genuinely feel different. My energy throughout the day is more stable. I’ve been falling asleep earlier without forcing it. I don’t feel that wired-tired feeling at night anymore. My mood has lifted too, not in a dramatic way, just a steady feeling of clarity. Even my motivation to stick to other habits has improved. I think this one simple ritual is acting like an anchor for the rest of my day.

The biggest win, though, is how it’s changed the vibe of my mornings. I used to wake up in a fog of noise and urgency. Now I start the day with a few quiet minutes of light and breath. It’s small, but it’s powerful. And it carries on for the entire day!!

If you’re thinking about trying this, I’d say just start tomorrow. No special gear, no fancy goals. Just step outside for a few minutes and let the sky do its thing. It’s been one of the easiest and most rewarding habits I’ve ever built.",3,1748063567.0,Procrastinationism,0,1.0,False

I spent every morning for a few weeks waking up on the dusty ground around the well. Those waking moments were the least drunk I'd be during those times. Every sunrise would bring a short period of time when I'd be confronted with the vibrant memory of my brother going over the side of the well. I could almost hear the sounds of feral mastication, every meaty crunch of bones cracking beneath ragged flesh echoing in my mind. I'd push myself up, look down at the empty bottle in my hand, and go inside to resume drinking.

I used to look at the farmhouse as a happy memory. I could still picture Danny and I running around the corn fields and my mother happily watching over us from the porch with our grandparents standing behind her. That happy place had become nothing more to me than a massive tombstone rising up from the ground now. Every step to my front door was haunted by the knowledge of what composed the foundations of this place. The happy memories I once held so dear had been buried alongside so many others within the mass grave I had come to live upon.

Some nights, I'd stumble out into the field, the path to the well lit by the moon like a beacon guiding me into Hell. I'd approach that profane altar and stand poised upon its lip. I'd walk around the edges, bottle in hand while hoping my foot would slip. I'd fantasize about going over the edge only for everything to stop. No more pain. No more shame. I'd balance on a single leg and take a long drink from the bottle of liquor in my hand. I'd drink until the dreamless sleep that I hoped death would be like would overtake me. Then, I'd wake up on the ground, preparing to do it all over again.

This continued, until I woke up before the sunrise one morning, pushed myself up, looked at the empty bottle, then noticed the old man watching me while leaning against that damn well.

“Good morning,” I croaked with a half wave before pushing myself up to my feet.

The old man lifted his hand to acknowledge my wave and I got a good look at him. He was large, but not fat, just very broad all around. His ruddy skin was a testament to years spent toiling in fields living the life of a farmhand. He was wearing a flannel shirt buttoned up to his neck as well as a leather jacket over it and faded blue jeans held up by a worn, brown leather belt. I held my hand out as he approached to greet him, and as he gripped my hand, I could feel the myriad of calluses covering his palms like armor.

“Good to meet you, Chester,” he rumbled, his voice much deeper than I had thought it'd be. “Your grandfather told me a lot about you. Sorry to hear he's gone. I'm Otto, your neighbor to the East.”

“You knew my grandfather?” I asked dumbly.

“Yea, I'd look after the well for him now and again. Don't look so shocked, most of us older folk here know about it. We got to be pretty good friends a while back, talked about our families and such. I'm gonna miss him quite a lot.”

He looked at me and I almost couldn't meet those sky-blue orbs that penetrated right through any facade of nonchalance I could erect. When I finally did force myself to meet his gaze, I couldn't hold it for longer than a split-second before having to glance back at the endless sea of corn stalks swaying in the morning breeze.

“Something on your mind, Chester?” Otto said in a low, soothing baritone.

I fought the tears, feeling pain creeping up the sides of my face from the strain of forcing my stinging eyes to stay open and dry. There was an awkward silence and the wind became the only sound.

“No, it's nothing, but I appreciate you asking,” I replied in a series of hoarse stutters after a full three seconds had passed.

Otto laid a hand on my shoulder.

“I got a nephew like you, about your age too. He always thinks he has to hide what he's going through, like he's embarrassed about it. Yet, in the end, he always opens up to his family. We always help him through it. So don't feel like you have something to gain by keeping your troubles a secret.”

Maybe it was his kind tone, maybe it was the way he reminded me of Grandpa Silas. Maybe it was the way my head felt like it was going to split in two if I didn't tell someone what was going on. In that moment, I poured out everything to this old man I had only just met. Otto listened too. I told him everything and he let me. The sun was over the horizon by the time I got to the end and finished crying over Daniel's death.

“It took him, Otto. The well. I don't know how to get him back. I don't know how to make it right,” I whispered shakily while wiping the tears from my dirt covered cheeks onto my dirt covered sleeves.

“When my nephew was really young, he convinced his parents to adopt this dog he found off the streets. The dog was fairly small and well behaved, so my sister and her husband agreed to hold onto the dog until the owners arrived. It soon became apparent that the dog was pregnant. So when the time came for the puppies, four were born and my nephew was instantly smitten by them. However, he didn't understand that puppies were fragile. He handled one a little rough and broke the poor things neck.”

The way Otto spoke was hypnotic, the story transfixing me so well that, for a moment, I forgot about my own pains and could only think of the poor dog.

“The dog died immediately, and my nephew was quite distraught. He felt guilty knowing his carelessness had facilitated that tragedy. However, guilt is our mind telling us to act in some way. So I gave him an act to do. I told him that he needed to take care of the other puppies for the rest of their lives. Feed them, walk them, love them. That's how he makes it right. So your brother, you say he has a wife and child? Maybe you can start making it right by helping them.”

I sniffed back tears and, for the first time in weeks, the weight crushing my chest lifted allowing me to breath. For the first time since Danny went down the well, I felt like I had direction. It wasn't strong enough to be called hope, but it was something. I thanked the old man and gave him a hug.

“Don't worry about it, young man. Though, now that you mention it, if I could borrow your tractor, I'll bring it back tomorrow morning.”

I laughed and said “That's no problem. So you used to help my grandfather with the well?”

“Oh yea, I wasn't the only one. There was a whole group of folks that did, at one point. They called themselves the Wishers. Some of the business owners in town are part of them. I don't really know too much about them though, I started helping your grand dad after he stopped allowing them onto his property. I never asked him too many questions about it, but he seemed to have some kind of problem with them.”

“Where are they now?”

“They're mostly business owners in town. The only one I can remember off hand is Amanda, the lady who owns the bar. The ocean-themed one.”

I had no idea what he was talking about, but made a mental note of it for the next time I was out there. He then thanked me for loaning him my tractor and I went inside the farmhouse where I could hear the phone ringing.

I picked it up and was greeted by my mother. She had been calling a lot since Danny went missing. Talking to her was always painful, but the idea of her suffering without my support was even worse.

“I think I have an idea of what happened to Danny!” she shouted into the receiver.

Her tone was that peculiar sound of forced elation that can only be born of the desperation lying just beneath it.

“Oh? What's that mom?”  
“He always loved camping, right? He'd joke about running off to live in the woods all the time. I think he did it, Chester! He could be out there, in the woods, just taking some time for himself... That's what I like to think, that he's out there and happy, just taking some time for himself before coming home. Do you think that could be where he is?”

As she talked, her voice became less excited and more dreamy. That is, until she asked for my participation in the delusion. It was a kind of bargaining we do so often with reality, pleading for tragedy to be replaced by compromise. In my mother's case, she could stomach her son going missing, so long as she didn't have to believe he was dead. She asked me in a pleading voice and I couldn't help but think I would do the same as her if I wasn't cursed with having seen exactly what happened to my only brother.

I blinked the tears out of my eyes and hunched over, keeping myself steady by placing a hand against the wall and fighting to stay strong for my mother.

“Yea, mom. I could definitely see that,” I said calmly while sitting on the floor and wrapping my arms around my knees that were firmly pressed to my chest.

“I had another dream about him last night, you know? I was at the farmhouse, watching you two play around in the corn field. You grandpa Silas was there too, hollering to stay away from the old well. Now grandpa Silas is gone and your brother-”

Her voice cracked for a moment and I realized that my mother, miles away on the other side of the phone, was being strong for me right now. That realization filled me with such shame that I had to bite my lip to avoid whimpering. I tasted blood by the time I recovered.

“It's okay, mom. He could be out there, sitting by a campfire right now, or fishing. It could be a lot of things. I'm sure he'll turn up,” I lied.

“You're right, sweetie. Sorry, I just miss him.”

“I do too, mom.”

That last part was the truth. The fact that we had grown so distant was painful before I had killed him. Knowing that I could never repair that relationship was almost as bad as knowing I had been the one to rob myself of that chance.

After I got off the phone, I crept upstairs and pulled my brother's phone out of my nightstand drawer to look at the lock-screen picture of us as children. It was at that moment that I remembered Otto's advice and texted Sarah. It started with a simple “how're you doing?” and became a solid stream of conversation. We would recount memories that we'd share with one another about Danny, or talking about how Blake was doing or simply offering support.

Blake looked a lot like his dad in the pictures that Sarah would send me. At twelve years old, every picture of him that Sarah sent me could have been a picture of my brother at that age. It hurt a little to look at those pictures, but it was also comforting. Before I knew it, I was asking Sarah about my nephew pretty often.

At first, it was clear that she was a proud parent, but it slowly became apparent that it was more than that. Blake was her last link in this world to Danny. Blake was the only piece of him left in her life now. So it should come as no surprise that she was becoming increasingly worried as Blake became more withdrawn.

“I still don't know what I was thinking, Otto,” I was saying a few days later, sitting on my front porch drinking coffee with my neighbor while he listened to my woes. “I didn't think she'd actually say yes to me.”

“You still haven't told me what you've done,” Otto grumbled, clearly wanting me to stop holding back and get to the point of my story. “You said she was saying she was worried about Blake and thought he needed to get a change of scenery for a little bit.”

“Yea, and I told her she's always welcome to come over here for a visit!”

“That's actually not a bad idea. This could be your best chance to find some closure. Helping your sister-in-law and your nephew to grieve, well, maybe it can help you with your guilt,” Otto said slowly in a voice that you could feel as much as hear.

“What about the well? Isn't it dangerous to have people around it?”

“Didn't your grandfather have you and your brother come to visit all the time as kids? What did he do when you two came over?”

I actually hadn't thought about this before and was stumped. I never saw him go feed the well when we were visiting. I'd of known, I used to get up and help him with the different jobs to do around the farm every morning, back when I used to want to be a farmer and before I was forced into being one by fate and circumstance. God certainly has a sense of irony.

“I have no idea what he did, but you said there was a group of people who used to help him, right? Maybe they would know?”  
“Maybe, but I need to get back to my farm. I'll be back by tomorrow morning to talk if you'd like.”

“Thanks, Otto. I'll talk to you in the morning. You can borrow my tractor if you need to, by the way.”

Otto gave a smirk and a half wave, then walked down the long driveway towards his land. I figured I'd go into town and get a few things if Sarah was coming over. Truthfully, I didn't feel ready to face the woman I had widowed and the child who's father I had murdered. The mere thought of it made me want to vomit, but that didn't matter. They were hurting and I could help them hurt a little less. It wouldn't bring Danny back, but maybe it could help me hurt a little less too.

I went inside to grab my car keys and was about to leave, relishing the feeling of slight optimism stirring inside me, that small sensation that was whispering in the back of my mind... that maybe... just maybe... life could go on.

That's when I heard the well screaming.



After feeding the well, I was on the road, speeding towards town to do some grocery shopping, load up on feed and enjoy access to the internet for a little while. Trees flew past either side of me as I wound my way towards the small patch of civilization nestled into the rolling fields of farmland.

I knew I was approaching the town when I saw the water tower stretching up on the right side of the road, the town name written across it. Just after the water tower is a huge hill, the town just on the other side of it. When you get to the top of the hill, you can see the little town in its entirety. It's actually a really pretty view and I always hesitate for a moment at the top of the hill, taking in the scene before flying down the asphalt ramp in front of me.

Once in town, I ran my errands, only hesitating in front of the liquor store for a moment before driving on and choosing to be sober for Sarah and Blake's visit. I felt rather proud of myself for that. In fact, I felt so proud, that I decided I deserved to have a few drinks before heading home. Sure, I had some groceries in the car, but I had bought a couple bags of ice to toss over them while I took my time. The hard part was finding a bar. I drove around slowly, keeping a wary eye open and finding nothing. I was about to give up when I turned the corner to see a sign that read “The Port Hole” that featured a little tugboat pulling the “e” at the end. I turned in and parked in front of the bar which only had three other cars in the parking lot.

I was walking towards the door while looking up at the sign when I remembered Otto talking about how the only Wisher he could remember was the one that owned a nautical themed bar. What had he said her name was? Amanda.

My hand pushed against worn wood and the door swung open revealing the dark interior inside. I stepped onto the wooden planks of the floor and closed the door behind me, waiting for my eyes to adjust. The life preservers on the walls were the first thing I noticed, along with the anchors and nets and all manner of random things one might associate with a boat. In the center of a the bar was a large ship-wheel, like something out a pirate movie, with the logo of a different beer on each arm of the wheel. The top of the bar was reminiscent of ship railing, and a black haired woman wearing a knee length skirt with a matching red blouse was leaned over it with a cloth to wipe it down. She looked up as I approached, fixing those green eyes onto mine and giving me a smile.

I realized that this must be Amanda, but she looked much younger than I had anticipated. She definitely wasn't that young, but she was no older than forty at the most. I had expected someone my grandfather's age, well into their seventies or eighties. That was the first surprise I received from Amanda.

In those precious few moments I had while walking to the bar, my mind blurred with a series of thoughts. Firstly, Amanda most likely had a falling out with my grandfather, so it would probably be best if I didn't tell her who I was. I could just say that I'm here to move in with my uncle. Wait, who's my uncle? Otto. Otto's my uncle. And I'm just here to get a drink. Should I mention the well? No, not yet. I'll have to do this a few times. Maybe in a week or two of coming up here every other day or so, I'll get close enough to mention it, see how she reacts. I have to get close to her first. Okay, I'll slowly get close to her and then I'll learn her secrets. Wait, I don't have time to-

All that went through my head before I sat down in front of her, deciding that I at least knew to introduce myself as Otto's nephew and could figure out the rest as I went.

“Hi, Chester, nice to finally meet you,” she greeted me in a sultry voice that matched her smirk.

Fuck.

“Good to meet you as well, uh...”

“Mandy. I own the bar here. I heard you had taken over your grandfather's farm,” she said nonchalantly while wiping a glass and not even looking at me.

She came off as smug and arrogant, as if everything I was doing was both mildly amusing and at risk of becoming boring. I immediately didn't like her. I think that fact that I was also immediately attracted to her made it even worse.

“Yea, we thought it best to keep the farm in the family,” I replied with a concerted effort to keep the annoyance I felt from creeping into my voice.

“Of course, that farm has been with your family since... well, I think your grandfather's grandfather, or something like that,” she said while filling up a glass with beer.

“Yea, something like...” I said, involuntarily shuddering at the thought of how long this ravenous pit has been tormenting my family.

She sat the beer in front of me and suddenly, I was trying to repress the urge to look down while also fighting not to be lost in those green gems that almost seemed to glow in the dim light of this shit-hole bar.

“It's on the house,” she said with a wink.

Something told me that while I may not be giving her money for this drink, it was far from free. Still, I was thirsty, and was coming up on the longest I had been sober since my brother's death.

“Thanks,” I muttered and took a drink, trying to pull my mind away from the image of my brother vanishing into the maw of a monster, and instead trying to think of how to broach the subject of the well with her.

“So, you're the new caretaker of the well, huh?”

Or maybe she'd beat me to it, I thought while trying to keep the look of shock from my face. Those eyes had me fixed in place now, Mandy's black hair softly brushing the counter as she leaned in closer to me. I could hear my heart beating in my ears now, but I forced myself to speak.

“Yea, I guess so. It still surprises me that so many people here know about it,” I said, taking another gulp of the beer to calm myself.

“It used to be a lot more than your grandfather who watched over that well...” she said in a cryptic and conspiratorial whisper that was almost... seductive.

“Were you one of the Wishers?” I whispered.

She smiled and leaned in until her otherworldly eyes were all I could see. She smelled like almonds and honey.

“Honey, I was *the* Wisher.”

“What exactly did *the* Wisher do?”

She leaned back sharply, giving me the smallest of reprieves before contorting her face in a pouting expression.

“We helped Silas with the well, and in return, we also got to use it.”

Her tone was vindictively playful. She knew she was giving a starving man breadcrumbs... and not just in terms of information.

“Wait, use it? I thought it just made the corn grow?” I replied evenly as my frustration only continued to eat away at me.

She leaned back in towards me again, locking me into her hypnotic gaze once again. She followed this with a wink and tapped her nose three times.

“It can do a lot more than that, Chester... A lot more...” she whispered, the last part directly into my ear.

I was simultaneously filled with a need to know more and the undeniable sensation that I was nearing an unseen danger. The first feeling won out and I pushed a little further.

“Maybe you can help me. I have some family coming for a visit and I couldn't help but realize my grandfather never fed the well while my brother and I were visiting him. How did he do that?”

I hoped by ignoring that she was flirting with me that she'd stop, but to both my pleasure and my dread, she was undeterred.

“There's ways to keep the well satiated for a while. Of course, everything the well gives must be purchased with flesh. That's why the Wishers came about...” she continued to whisper, forcing me to lean closer to hear her.

I waited for her to say more, but instead, she let the moment draw out with us face to face like that. It was the closest I had been to a woman in a while, and I couldn't help but wonder how it would feel to kiss her.

“Do you think you could teach me more about the well?” I asked, finally matching her tone and playing her game.

Her lips curled into a full grin and she was whispering in my ear again.

“I'd love to, but this isn't a good time. I could always drop by tomorrow morning though, if that's okay.”

“Sounds perfect. I'll see you then,” I whispered back, my heart thumping in my ears.

I finished my drink after that, knocking back the rest in one smooth gulp, and started to head back towards the farm. I was full of the strangest blend of foreboding and anticipation, fearing and yearning to trapped alone with Mandy's surreal gaze.

When I got back home, the sun was setting in the distance, painting the countryside in hues of gold and amber beneath a sky the color of flames. I could see the black silhouette of the well squatting in the field next to the farmhouse, looking like a small temple of dark stones. No, that's not quite it. It looked like a sacrificial altar awaiting the next victim.

The next morning, I woke up to knocking on the door. I wandered down the stairs, pulling on a shirt as I did so. I was expecting Mandy's petite frame standing in the doorway, but when I swung open the door, it was Otto's broad form filling the porch.

“Good morning, Chester! Just wanted to check on you and make sure you're were doing okay,” he said in a voice that one could feel vibrating in their chest.

“I'm doing pretty good, though I'm glad you stopped by. I had a question,” I responded while gesturing for him to come inside.

“If it's about the tractor, I planned to put more gas in it today,” he said while taking a seat at the kitchen table and looking a little sheepish.

“What? Never mind, that's not what this is about. Do you remember you mentioning the Wishers? I found Amanda, she said she's teach me more about the well.”

Otto gave me a serious look.

“Are you sure that's a good idea, Ches? Your grandfather seemed to have had some kind of issue with them.”

“Believe me, I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but this Mandy woman seems to know something. I can't take a chance on Sarah and Blake getting hurt when they come to visit.”

Otto considered this for a moment and then nodded his head in agreement.

“Just be careful, Ches. If anything happens, just know that you can always call on me for help,” Otto rumbled, standing up as he did so.

“Thanks, Otto. I'm glad to have you hear. It means a lot.”

He didn't say a word, just placed a large hand on my shoulder and gave me a knowing smile, then headed out the door.

I wish I could say that I sat down and thought about the risks I had been too stupid to realize that I had been taking, or that I had taken a moment to consider the people I was putting in danger, but I didn't. Instead, I went and shaved and groomed my hair, unable to stop my mind from wandering to Mandy's plump lips and raven hair.

Just as I finished, I heard the sound of tires crunching on the gravel road outside the house and was down the stairs just as the first knock came. I opened the door and grinned like an idiot at the Mandy who was wearing skin tight blue jeans coupled a white dress shirt with the top three buttons left undone.

“Wow, it looks just the same as it did the last time I saw it...” she muttered with a far away look on her face as she scanned every inch of the room she was stepping into.

It took me a moment to realize she was talking about the farm which had the strange quality of being seemingly frozen in time.

“I thought the same thing too when I got here,” I muttered absentmindedly while gesturing for her to follow me inside.

We sat at the kitchen table and once again, I was confronted with the honey and almond smell of her perfume. She smiled and leaned forward across the table, fixing me with that supernatural gaze.

“So, you want to know about the well?” she said with a crooked smile after a moments pause.

“I would *love* to know about the well,” I replied, matching her tone.

“What do you want more than anything in the world, Chester?” she asked excitedly.

You, I thought.

“To have my brother back.” I said. “And call me Ches.”

“The well can do a lot of things... Ches,” she said with a heavy emphasis on my name that made my head spin. “It's just a matter of what you're willing to pay for it. Flesh is its currency, and the bigger the dream, the more flesh to pay.”

“What does this have to do with keeping the well quiet for a week or two?” I asked, confused.

She narrowed her eyes and leaned forward a little more, closing the gap between us and making my mind fog over again.

“The well is meant to grant wishes. If you let someone make a big enough wish, the well will go silent for a while. But it has to be a big wish.”

“Okay, so I throw a few pounds of meat down the well and wish for my brother back. I'll throw a whole cow down there if I have to-”

“That's not how it works, Ches,” she said, placing a finger on my lips to shush me. I wanted to be mad about it so bad, but... I was entranced.

“The well doesn't accept dead flesh for this. It needs to be a live human, the younger, the better.”

My blood ran cold and the spell was broken. I jumped up so fast that I knocked the chair I was sitting in over in the process. The full reality of what she was talking about settled over me, making me feel sick.

“Are you suggesting we kill children?!” I screamed.

Mandy suddenly looked irritated.

“Don't be like your grandfather, Ches! Babies die in nature all the time. Don't you realize you could have anything you like? You could have your brother back, you could be rich, you could be young forever! Think you about it! Every dream you've ever had, they can all come true! What kind of price would you pay to have every dream you ever had be a reality?”

“Babies? Mandy, do you hear yourself?”

“Don't be an idiot, Ches. Your grandfather started off with the occasional prisoner in the town jail, but even if he never admitted it, those prisoners got younger and younger each time...”

“You're lying...” I stuttered, my words falling flat without the force of conviction behind them.

“No, Ches, I'm not,” she growled darkly, standing and beginning the step around the table to close the distance between us.

“I can't believe that grandpa Silas would be okay with such a thing...” I heard myself saying, more a plea to my own ears and than any sort of a rebuttal.

“Chester... you're not thinking about it. You could have *anything* you want. What would you not give to have your brother back?”

She had slipped back into a seductive and sympathetic whisper, and as much as I hate to admit it, the words found their mark. I looked down at the floor, too ashamed to lift my face any higher as I felt Mandy step in even closer, the smell of almonds and honey enveloping me again.

“What would I have to do?” I breathed as I felt her arms slide up and around my neck.

“Only that what you're meant to do,” I heard her say as her face filled my vision, her ghostly green eyes burrowing into me.

“What was I meant to do?” I muttered over the sound of my beating heart.

She leaned in until her lips were brushing my ear and I already knew the words she would utter before they left her mouth.

The post absolutely blew up. At the time, I was feeling pretty scattered. I had a bad habit of starting my day on autopilot, immediately reaching for my phone, and losing 30–60 minutes to mindless scrolling. I didn’t feel grounded. I was waking up groggy, staying up too late, and just going through the motions.

The advice I kept seeing in books, podcasts, and random Reddit comments was surprisingly consistent: get outside first thing in the morning and let natural light hit your eyes. It sounded simple enough, so I gave myself a challenge. Just try it every morning for three weeks. No pressure to be perfect, but try to stay consistent.

So here I am, 21 days later, and I’ve actually stuck with it. Every single morning. Some days I go for a walk, some days I just stand on the balcony with a coffee. If it’s sunny, I get about 5–10 minutes of direct light. I've consistently used that app to take a pic of the sun so I can only access Reddit and stuff once I've hit my sunlight session for the morning. If it’s cloudy, I still go out and let the brightness hit my face. I leave my phone inside. No music, no distractions. Just stillness.

It’s hard to describe exactly how it’s helped, but I genuinely feel different. My energy throughout the day is more stable. I’ve been falling asleep earlier without forcing it. I don’t feel that wired-tired feeling at night anymore. My mood has lifted too, not in a dramatic way, just a steady feeling of clarity. Even my motivation to stick to other habits has improved. I think this one simple ritual is acting like an anchor for the rest of my day.

The biggest win, though, is how it’s changed the vibe of my mornings. I used to wake up in a fog of noise and urgency. Now I start the day with a few quiet minutes of light and breath. It’s small, but it’s powerful. And it carries on for the entire day!!

If you’re thinking about trying this, I’d say just start tomorrow. No special gear, no fancy goals. Just step outside for a few minutes and let the sky do its thing. It’s been one of the easiest and most rewarding habits I’ve ever built.",7,1748063437.0,Habits,1,1.0,False

Sorry I haven't posted in a long time. I've had a lot going on since my last post and just haven't had time to put all the words down. Anyways, I'll just hop right into it. 

I spent every morning for a few weeks waking up on the dusty ground around the well. Those waking moments were the least drunk I'd be during those times. Every sunrise would bring a short period of time when I'd be confronted with the vibrant memory of my brother going over the side of the well. I could almost hear the sounds of feral mastication, every meaty crunch of bones cracking beneath ragged flesh echoing in my mind. I'd push myself up, look down at the empty bottle in my hand, and go inside to resume drinking.

I used to look at the farmhouse as a happy memory. I could still picture Danny and I running around the corn fields and my mother happily watching over us from the porch with our grandparents standing behind her. That happy place had become nothing more to me than a massive tombstone rising up from the ground now. Every step to my front door was haunted by the knowledge of what composed the foundations of this place. The happy memories I once held so dear had been buried alongside so many others within the mass grave I had come to live upon.

Some nights, I'd stumble out into the field, the path to the well lit by the moon like a beacon guiding me into Hell. I'd approach that profane altar and stand poised upon its lip. I'd walk around the edges, bottle in hand while hoping my foot would slip. I'd fantasize about going over the edge only for everything to stop. No more pain. No more shame. I'd balance on a single leg and take a long drink from the bottle of liquor in my hand. I'd drink until the dreamless sleep that I hoped death would be like would overtake me. Then, I'd wake up on the ground, preparing to do it all over again.

This continued, until I woke up before the sunrise one morning, pushed myself up, looked at the empty bottle, then noticed the old man watching me while leaning against that damn well.

“Good morning,” I croaked with a half wave before pushing myself up to my feet.

The old man lifted his hand to acknowledge my wave and I got a good look at him. He was large, but not fat, just very broad all around. His ruddy skin was a testament to years spent toiling in fields living the life of a farmhand. He was wearing a flannel shirt buttoned up to his neck as well as a leather jacket over it and faded blue jeans held up by a worn, brown leather belt. I held my hand out as he approached to greet him, and as he gripped my hand, I could feel the myriad of calluses covering his palms like armor.

“Good to meet you, Chester,” he rumbled, his voice much deeper than I had thought it'd be. “Your grandfather told me a lot about you. Sorry to hear he's gone. I'm Otto, your neighbor to the East.”

“You knew my grandfather?” I asked dumbly.

“Yea, I'd look after the well for him now and again. Don't look so shocked, most of us older folk here know about it. We got to be pretty good friends a while back, talked about our families and such. I'm gonna miss him quite a lot.”

He looked at me and I almost couldn't meet those sky-blue orbs that penetrated right through any facade of nonchalance I could erect. When I finally did force myself to meet his gaze, I couldn't hold it for longer than a split-second before having to glance back at the endless sea of corn stalks swaying in the morning breeze.

“Something on your mind, Chester?” Otto said in a low, soothing baritone.

I fought the tears, feeling pain creeping up the sides of my face from the strain of forcing my stinging eyes to stay open and dry. There was an awkward silence and the wind became the only sound.

“No, it's nothing, but I appreciate you asking,” I replied in a series of hoarse stutters after a full three seconds had passed.

Otto laid a hand on my shoulder.

“I got a nephew like you, about your age too. He always thinks he has to hide what he's going through, like he's embarrassed about it. Yet, in the end, he always opens up to his family. We always help him through it. So don't feel like you have something to gain by keeping your troubles a secret.”

Maybe it was his kind tone, maybe it was the way he reminded me of Grandpa Silas. Maybe it was the way my head felt like it was going to split in two if I didn't tell someone what was going on. In that moment, I poured out everything to this old man I had only just met. Otto listened too. I told him everything and he let me. The sun was over the horizon by the time I got to the end and finished crying over Daniel's death.

“It took him, Otto. The well. I don't know how to get him back. I don't know how to make it right,” I whispered shakily while wiping the tears from my dirt covered cheeks onto my dirt covered sleeves.

“When my nephew was really young, he convinced his parents to adopt this dog he found off the streets. The dog was fairly small and well behaved, so my sister and her husband agreed to hold onto the dog until the owners arrived. It soon became apparent that the dog was pregnant. So when the time came for the puppies, four were born and my nephew was instantly smitten by them. However, he didn't understand that puppies were fragile. He handled one a little rough and broke the poor things neck.”

The way Otto spoke was hypnotic, the story transfixing me so well that, for a moment, I forgot about my own pains and could only think of the poor dog.

“The dog died immediately, and my nephew was quite distraught. He felt guilty knowing his carelessness had facilitated that tragedy. However, guilt is our mind telling us to act in some way. So I gave him an act to do. I told him that he needed to take care of the other puppies for the rest of their lives. Feed them, walk them, love them. That's how he makes it right. So your brother, you say he has a wife and child? Maybe you can start making it right by helping them.”

I sniffed back tears and, for the first time in weeks, the weight crushing my chest lifted allowing me to breath. For the first time since Danny went down the well, I felt like I had direction. It wasn't strong enough to be called hope, but it was something. I thanked the old man and gave him a hug.

“Don't worry about it, young man. Though, now that you mention it, if I could borrow your tractor, I'll bring it back tomorrow morning.”

I laughed and said “That's no problem. So you used to help my grandfather with the well?”

“Oh yea, I wasn't the only one. There was a whole group of folks that did, at one point. They called themselves the Wishers. Some of the business owners in town are part of them. I don't really know too much about them though, I started helping your grand dad after he stopped allowing them onto his property. I never asked him too many questions about it, but he seemed to have some kind of problem with them.”

“Where are they now?”

“They're mostly business owners in town. The only one I can remember off hand is Amanda, the lady who owns the bar. The ocean-themed one.”

I had no idea what he was talking about, but made a mental note of it for the next time I was out there. He then thanked me for loaning him my tractor and I went inside the farmhouse where I could hear the phone ringing.

I picked it up and was greeted by my mother. She had been calling a lot since Danny went missing. Talking to her was always painful, but the idea of her suffering without my support was even worse.

“I think I have an idea of what happened to Danny!” she shouted into the receiver.

Her tone was that peculiar sound of forced elation that can only be born of the desperation lying just beneath it.

“Oh? What's that mom?”  
“He always loved camping, right? He'd joke about running off to live in the woods all the time. I think he did it, Chester! He could be out there, in the woods, just taking some time for himself... That's what I like to think, that he's out there and happy, just taking some time for himself before coming home. Do you think that could be where he is?”

As she talked, her voice became less excited and more dreamy. That is, until she asked for my participation in the delusion. It was a kind of bargaining we do so often with reality, pleading for tragedy to be replaced by compromise. In my mother's case, she could stomach her son going missing, so long as she didn't have to believe he was dead. She asked me in a pleading voice and I couldn't help but think I would do the same as her if I wasn't cursed with having seen exactly what happened to my only brother.

I blinked the tears out of my eyes and hunched over, keeping myself steady by placing a hand against the wall and fighting to stay strong for my mother.

“Yea, mom. I could definitely see that,” I said calmly while sitting on the floor and wrapping my arms around my knees that were firmly pressed to my chest.

“I had another dream about him last night, you know? I was at the farmhouse, watching you two play around in the corn field. You grandpa Silas was there too, hollering to stay away from the old well. Now grandpa Silas is gone and your brother-”

Her voice cracked for a moment and I realized that my mother, miles away on the other side of the phone, was being strong for me right now. That realization filled me with such shame that I had to bite my lip to avoid whimpering. I tasted blood by the time I recovered.

“It's okay, mom. He could be out there, sitting by a campfire right now, or fishing. It could be a lot of things. I'm sure he'll turn up,” I lied.

“You're right, sweetie. Sorry, I just miss him.”

“I do too, mom.”

That last part was the truth. The fact that we had grown so distant was painful before I had killed him. Knowing that I could never repair that relationship was almost as bad as knowing I had been the one to rob myself of that chance.

After I got off the phone, I crept upstairs and pulled my brother's phone out of my nightstand drawer to look at the lock-screen picture of us as children. It was at that moment that I remembered Otto's advice and texted Sarah. It started with a simple “how're you doing?” and became a solid stream of conversation. We would recount memories that we'd share with one another about Danny, or talking about how Blake was doing or simply offering support.

Blake looked a lot like his dad in the pictures that Sarah would send me. At twelve years old, every picture of him that Sarah sent me could have been a picture of my brother at that age. It hurt a little to look at those pictures, but it was also comforting. Before I knew it, I was asking Sarah about my nephew pretty often.

At first, it was clear that she was a proud parent, but it slowly became apparent that it was more than that. Blake was her last link in this world to Danny. Blake was the only piece of him left in her life now. So it should come as no surprise that she was becoming increasingly worried as Blake became more withdrawn.

“I still don't know what I was thinking, Otto,” I was saying a few days later, sitting on my front porch drinking coffee with my neighbor while he listened to my woes. “I didn't think she'd actually say yes to me.”

“You still haven't told me what you've done,” Otto grumbled, clearly wanting me to stop holding back and get to the point of my story. “You said she was saying she was worried about Blake and thought he needed to get a change of scenery for a little bit.”

“Yea, and I told her she's always welcome to come over here for a visit!”

“That's actually not a bad idea. This could be your best chance to find some closure. Helping your sister-in-law and your nephew to grieve, well, maybe it can help you with your guilt,” Otto said slowly in a voice that you could feel as much as hear.

“What about the well? Isn't it dangerous to have people around it?”

“Didn't your grandfather have you and your brother come to visit all the time as kids? What did he do when you two came over?”

I actually hadn't thought about this before and was stumped. I never saw him go feed the well when we were visiting. I'd of known, I used to get up and help him with the different jobs to do around the farm every morning, back when I used to want to be a farmer and before I was forced into being one by fate and circumstance. God certainly has a sense of irony.

“I have no idea what he did, but you said there was a group of people who used to help him, right? Maybe they would know?”  
“Maybe, but I need to get back to my farm. I'll be back by tomorrow morning to talk if you'd like.”

“Thanks, Otto. I'll talk to you in the morning. You can borrow my tractor if you need to, by the way.”

Otto gave a smirk and a half wave, then walked down the long driveway towards his land. I figured I'd go into town and get a few things if Sarah was coming over. Truthfully, I didn't feel ready to face the woman I had widowed and the child who's father I had murdered. The mere thought of it made me want to vomit, but that didn't matter. They were hurting and I could help them hurt a little less. It wouldn't bring Danny back, but maybe it could help me hurt a little less too.

I went inside to grab my car keys and was about to leave, relishing the feeling of slight optimism stirring inside me, that small sensation that was whispering in the back of my mind... that maybe... just maybe... life could go on.

That's when I heard the well screaming.



After feeding the well, I was on the road, speeding towards town to do some grocery shopping, load up on feed and enjoy access to the internet for a little while. Trees flew past either side of me as I wound my way towards the small patch of civilization nestled into the rolling fields of farmland.

I knew I was approaching the town when I saw the water tower stretching up on the right side of the road, the town name written across it. Just after the water tower is a huge hill, the town just on the other side of it. When you get to the top of the hill, you can see the little town in its entirety. It's actually a really pretty view and I always hesitate for a moment at the top of the hill, taking in the scene before flying down the asphalt ramp in front of me.

Once in town, I ran my errands, only hesitating in front of the liquor store for a moment before driving on and choosing to be sober for Sarah and Blake's visit. I felt rather proud of myself for that. In fact, I felt so proud, that I decided I deserved to have a few drinks before heading home. Sure, I had some groceries in the car, but I had bought a couple bags of ice to toss over them while I took my time. The hard part was finding a bar. I drove around slowly, keeping a wary eye open and finding nothing. I was about to give up when I turned the corner to see a sign that read “The Port Hole” that featured a little tugboat pulling the “e” at the end. I turned in and parked in front of the bar which only had three other cars in the parking lot.

I was walking towards the door while looking up at the sign when I remembered Otto talking about how the only Wisher he could remember was the one that owned a nautical themed bar. What had he said her name was? Amanda.

My hand pushed against worn wood and the door swung open revealing the dark interior inside. I stepped onto the wooden planks of the floor and closed the door behind me, waiting for my eyes to adjust. The life preservers on the walls were the first thing I noticed, along with the anchors and nets and all manner of random things one might associate with a boat. In the center of a the bar was a large ship-wheel, like something out a pirate movie, with the logo of a different beer on each arm of the wheel. The top of the bar was reminiscent of ship railing, and a black haired woman wearing a knee length skirt with a matching red blouse was leaned over it with a cloth to wipe it down. She looked up as I approached, fixing those green eyes onto mine and giving me a smile.

I realized that this must be Amanda, but she looked much younger than I had anticipated. She definitely wasn't that young, but she was no older than forty at the most. I had expected someone my grandfather's age, well into their seventies or eighties. That was the first surprise I received from Amanda.

In those precious few moments I had while walking to the bar, my mind blurred with a series of thoughts. Firstly, Amanda most likely had a falling out with my grandfather, so it would probably be best if I didn't tell her who I was. I could just say that I'm here to move in with my uncle. Wait, who's my uncle? Otto. Otto's my uncle. And I'm just here to get a drink. Should I mention the well? No, not yet. I'll have to do this a few times. Maybe in a week or two of coming up here every other day or so, I'll get close enough to mention it, see how she reacts. I have to get close to her first. Okay, I'll slowly get close to her and then I'll learn her secrets. Wait, I don't have time to-

All that went through my head before I sat down in front of her, deciding that I at least knew to introduce myself as Otto's nephew and could figure out the rest as I went.

“Hi, Chester, nice to finally meet you,” she greeted me in a sultry voice that matched her smirk.

Fuck.

“Good to meet you as well, uh...”

“Mandy. I own the bar here. I heard you had taken over your grandfather's farm,” she said nonchalantly while wiping a glass and not even looking at me.

She came off as smug and arrogant, as if everything I was doing was both mildly amusing and at risk of becoming boring. I immediately didn't like her. I think that fact that I was also immediately attracted to her made it even worse.

“Yea, we thought it best to keep the farm in the family,” I replied with a concerted effort to keep the annoyance I felt from creeping into my voice.

“Of course, that farm has been with your family since... well, I think your grandfather's grandfather, or something like that,” she said while filling up a glass with beer.

“Yea, something like...” I said, involuntarily shuddering at the thought of how long this ravenous pit has been tormenting my family.

She sat the beer in front of me and suddenly, I was trying to repress the urge to look down while also fighting not to be lost in those green gems that almost seemed to glow in the dim light of this shit-hole bar.

“It's on the house,” she said with a wink.

Something told me that while I may not be giving her money for this drink, it was far from free. Still, I was thirsty, and was coming up on the longest I had been sober since my brother's death.

“Thanks,” I muttered and took a drink, trying to pull my mind away from the image of my brother vanishing into the maw of a monster, and instead trying to think of how to broach the subject of the well with her.

“So, you're the new caretaker of the well, huh?”

Or maybe she'd beat me to it, I thought while trying to keep the look of shock from my face. Those eyes had me fixed in place now, Mandy's black hair softly brushing the counter as she leaned in closer to me. I could hear my heart beating in my ears now, but I forced myself to speak.

“Yea, I guess so. It still surprises me that so many people here know about it,” I said, taking another gulp of the beer to calm myself.

“It used to be a lot more than your grandfather who watched over that well...” she said in a cryptic and conspiratorial whisper that was almost... seductive.

“Were you one of the Wishers?” I whispered.

She smiled and leaned in until her otherworldly eyes were all I could see. She smelled like almonds and honey.

“Honey, I was *the* Wisher.”

“What exactly did *the* Wisher do?”

She leaned back sharply, giving me the smallest of reprieves before contorting her face in a pouting expression.

“We helped Silas with the well, and in return, we also got to use it.”

Her tone was vindictively playful. She knew she was giving a starving man breadcrumbs... and not just in terms of information.

“Wait, use it? I thought it just made the corn grow?” I replied evenly as my frustration only continued to eat away at me.

She leaned back in towards me again, locking me into her hypnotic gaze once again. She followed this with a wink and tapped her nose three times.

“It can do a lot more than that, Chester... A lot more...” she whispered, the last part directly into my ear.

I was simultaneously filled with a need to know more and the undeniable sensation that I was nearing an unseen danger. The first feeling won out and I pushed a little further.

“Maybe you can help me. I have some family coming for a visit and I couldn't help but realize my grandfather never fed the well while my brother and I were visiting him. How did he do that?”

I hoped by ignoring that she was flirting with me that she'd stop, but to both my pleasure and my dread, she was undeterred.

“There's ways to keep the well satiated for a while. Of course, everything the well gives must be purchased with flesh. That's why the Wishers came about...” she continued to whisper, forcing me to lean closer to hear her.

I waited for her to say more, but instead, she let the moment draw out with us face to face like that. It was the closest I had been to a woman in a while, and I couldn't help but wonder how it would feel to kiss her.

“Do you think you could teach me more about the well?” I asked, finally matching her tone and playing her game.

Her lips curled into a full grin and she was whispering in my ear again.

“I'd love to, but this isn't a good time. I could always drop by tomorrow morning though, if that's okay.”

“Sounds perfect. I'll see you then,” I whispered back, my heart thumping in my ears.

I finished my drink after that, knocking back the rest in one smooth gulp, and started to head back towards the farm. I was full of the strangest blend of foreboding and anticipation, fearing and yearning to trapped alone with Mandy's surreal gaze.

When I got back home, the sun was setting in the distance, painting the countryside in hues of gold and amber beneath a sky the color of flames. I could see the black silhouette of the well squatting in the field next to the farmhouse, looking like a small temple of dark stones. No, that's not quite it. It looked like a sacrificial altar awaiting the next victim.

The next morning, I woke up to knocking on the door. I wandered down the stairs, pulling on a shirt as I did so. I was expecting Mandy's petite frame standing in the doorway, but when I swung open the door, it was Otto's broad form filling the porch.

“Good morning, Chester! Just wanted to check on you and make sure you're were doing okay,” he said in a voice that one could feel vibrating in their chest.

“I'm doing pretty good, though I'm glad you stopped by. I had a question,” I responded while gesturing for him to come inside.

“If it's about the tractor, I planned to put more gas in it today,” he said while taking a seat at the kitchen table and looking a little sheepish.

“What? Never mind, that's not what this is about. Do you remember you mentioning the Wishers? I found Amanda, she said she's teach me more about the well.”

Otto gave me a serious look.

“Are you sure that's a good idea, Ches? Your grandfather seemed to have had some kind of issue with them.”

“Believe me, I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but this Mandy woman seems to know something. I can't take a chance on Sarah and Blake getting hurt when they come to visit.”

Otto considered this for a moment and then nodded his head in agreement.

“Just be careful, Ches. If anything happens, just know that you can always call on me for help,” Otto rumbled, standing up as he did so.

“Thanks, Otto. I'm glad to have you hear. It means a lot.”

He didn't say a word, just placed a large hand on my shoulder and gave me a knowing smile, then headed out the door.

I wish I could say that I sat down and thought about the risks I had been too stupid to realize that I had been taking, or that I had taken a moment to consider the people I was putting in danger, but I didn't. Instead, I went and shaved and groomed my hair, unable to stop my mind from wandering to Mandy's plump lips and raven hair.

Just as I finished, I heard the sound of tires crunching on the gravel road outside the house and was down the stairs just as the first knock came. I opened the door and grinned like an idiot at the Mandy who was wearing skin tight blue jeans coupled a white dress shirt with the top three buttons left undone.

“Wow, it looks just the same as it did the last time I saw it...” she muttered with a far away look on her face as she scanned every inch of the room she was stepping into.

It took me a moment to realize she was talking about the farm which had the strange quality of being seemingly frozen in time.

“I thought the same thing too when I got here,” I muttered absentmindedly while gesturing for her to follow me inside.

We sat at the kitchen table and once again, I was confronted with the honey and almond smell of her perfume. She smiled and leaned forward across the table, fixing me with that supernatural gaze.

“So, you want to know about the well?” she said with a crooked smile after a moments pause.

“I would *love* to know about the well,” I replied, matching her tone.

“What do you want more than anything in the world, Chester?” she asked excitedly.

You, I thought.

“To have my brother back.” I said. “And call me Ches.”

“The well can do a lot of things... Ches,” she said with a heavy emphasis on my name that made my head spin. “It's just a matter of what you're willing to pay for it. Flesh is its currency, and the bigger the dream, the more flesh to pay.”

“What does this have to do with keeping the well quiet for a week or two?” I asked, confused.

She narrowed her eyes and leaned forward a little more, closing the gap between us and making my mind fog over again.

“The well is meant to grant wishes. If you let someone make a big enough wish, the well will go silent for a while. But it has to be a big wish.”

“Okay, so I throw a few pounds of meat down the well and wish for my brother back. I'll throw a whole cow down there if I have to-”

“That's not how it works, Ches,” she said, placing a finger on my lips to shush me. I wanted to be mad about it so bad, but... I was entranced.

“The well doesn't accept dead flesh for this. It needs to be a live human, the younger, the better.”

My blood ran cold and the spell was broken. I jumped up so fast that I knocked the chair I was sitting in over in the process. The full reality of what she was talking about settled over me, making me feel sick.

“Are you suggesting we kill children?!” I screamed.

Mandy suddenly looked irritated.

“Don't be like your grandfather, Ches! Babies die in nature all the time. Don't you realize you could have anything you like? You could have your brother back, you could be rich, you could be young forever! Think you about it! Every dream you've ever had, they can all come true! What kind of price would you pay to have every dream you ever had be a reality?”

“Babies? Mandy, do you hear yourself?”

“Don't be an idiot, Ches. Your grandfather started off with the occasional prisoner in the town jail, but even if he never admitted it, those prisoners got younger and younger each time...”

“You're lying...” I stuttered, my words falling flat without the force of conviction behind them.

“No, Ches, I'm not,” she growled darkly, standing and beginning the step around the table to close the distance between us.

“I can't believe that grandpa Silas would be okay with such a thing...” I heard myself saying, more a plea to my own ears and than any sort of a rebuttal.

“Chester... you're not thinking about it. You could have *anything* you want. What would you not give to have your brother back?”

She had slipped back into a seductive and sympathetic whisper, and as much as I hate to admit it, the words found their mark. I looked down at the floor, too ashamed to lift my face any higher as I felt Mandy step in even closer, the smell of almonds and honey enveloping me again.

“What would I have to do?” I breathed as I felt her arms slide up and around my neck.

“Only that what you're meant to do,” I heard her say as her face filled my vision, her ghostly green eyes burrowing into me.

“What was I meant to do?” I muttered over the sound of my beating heart.

She leaned in until her lips were brushing my ear and I already knew the words she would utter before they left her mouth.

I moved to the USA a few years ago with my partner from England. I found out he had been cheating so I ended that relationship. I left that relationship with literally nothing apart from some personal belongings, we were having a house built together which was in both of our names (name on land and deeds).  I was friends with a US citizen who I've known since I moved here. We ended up getting into a romantic relationship and he moved me in. He knew my ex and my situation. We decided early on to get married. The connection was amazing, he was generous and said he would pay for everything and I can start saving for a vehicle.

We had an amazing summer together, he introduced me to all of his friends, let me use his vehicle to get to and from work and told me I could all throughout the summer and then in the winter it would be going into storage, was an amazing partner and it all seemed like a dream. We even booked a trip to Maui for January 2025. We even flew back to the UK so he could ask my Dad for my hand in marriage, I paid for the flights for us to return to my home as I felt he had been great with him letting me move into his home.

I noticed a few red flags before our vacation to England. Jealousy around me talking to members of the opposite sex, and there were comments on me wearing makeup and who was I doing it for and trying to impress etc and he said he would prefer it if I did not wear it.

Fast forward to our trip to England, that was amazing. My parents liked him and were pleased I was getting married. When we returned home, things were still going well. He proposed and we got married in August of 2024. This is when things began to change. I applied for my visa to obtain my green card through marriage. I completed all the paperwork solely by myself with no help from my husband and paid for it all my self too. Please keep in mind in this time I am supposed to be saving for a vehicle too, with the limited funds I had due to the only job I could get without work authorization. So paying out for filing the paperwork wiped out most of what I had saved. My husband said this was fine and whatever I had saved he would make up the rest.

Fast forward a week later, he asks how much I have saved, is not happy with that amount and tells me I should have more. I ended up selling a designer watch and necklace so I would have more funds. We are now in November and the weather is starting to get colder, he asks how much money I have as the vehicle is now going into storage and there is snow on the ground. Considering the money I had just laid out for the visa I did not have as much as he wanted me too. This resulted in him putting the vehicle into storage and leaving me with no vehicle at all. He agreed to contribute with me or even suggested getting a loan. Now he had changed his mind, would not help me at all and proceeded to tell me he felt used and that I was taking advantage of him. He tells me he wants to separate and start seeing other people, however we are still married. I continue to stay in our bedroom but on his terms we are separated, he would go out to the bat without me and leave me at home, he said he was not going to pay for me anymore, and that this was fault for not saving enough for a vehicle, even though there was never an agreed amount I would need to have saved that was acceptable to him. So now the job that I do have colleagues that I am working with are picking me up and I am giving them gas money.

Fast forward a couple of months and he seems to have ""forgiven"" me for this and goes back and forth between being with me and then waiting to separate. I've Thanksgiving he leaves me at home and goes on one of his many trips to the bar and does not return until 4am. My friend messaged me who was at the bat with me to ask me what is going on, he overheard my husband bad mouthing me, calling me a leech and saying how he wants to get an annulment. He ends up going back to my friends house, with my friends ex girlfriend and .u shuabnd gets into a hot tub with her naked. Then he comes home to me as of nothing has happened, obviously not knowing that I know. And when i did confront it, his argument and justification was that we were separated so it was okay. Along with the separations, criticisms, name calling and belittling have also started. Everything that I was previously praised for is now an issue. Everything I do is wrong. I am labeled as stupid, incapable retarded, a dud of a wife and I being told I have done nothing with my life. This is just naming of a few of things that were said.

Our trip to Maui is coming up, and he says maybe this will be a good way to rekindle our relationship, even though we were going with another couple and another one of our friends we were treating it as a honeymoon. So we go on the trip, the first couple of days are great. He is telling me he can see the effort I am making (I had just received my work authorization before our trip) applying for jobs etc..  and that he was falling in love with me all over again. A couple of days later we go on a boat trip and there was an open bar so quite a lot of alcohol was consumed. We get back to our room a bit later a he apologizes for the last few months and being distant and so hard on me, we had not spoken about the hot tub incident, so I bought that up and he lost it, how dare I bring that up on vacation, how nothing happened anyway even though he was named. And said in hindsight he should have just had sex with her. The next morning he proceeds to tell me he is going to fly home as I am selfish for bringing up the hot tub scenario. He threatens to leave me there and he is going to tell our friends at breakfast that he is flying home, this never happens and the vacation continues. However later on that evening I am concerned by my husbands behavior, the name calling hasn't stopped, and that that morning he was threatening to fly home. Obviously things have not been great for a few months, there has been added Jealousy and accusations of me cheating with no proof and lots of control where my phone is concerned. So that night I reach out to my Mum back in England, I am talking to her about the possibility of returning home, I am clearly acknowledging that I am in an emotionally abusive relationship so I am venting to her, and asking what she thinks I should do. Later on we go to bed and my husband asks to see my phone, he wants to check it to prove I am not cheating, he said I had been on it for a while and who am I talking to? So I told him I was having a private conversation with My Mum, he demands to see my phone as he does not believe me. I said as his wife he should trust me and in this instance give me privacy, and he has checked my phone in the past for the same reason and never found anything. I then go out of the room to call my Mum as I am concerned. I return to our room and tell him we need to talk.  He tells me to fuck off and rolls over and goes to sleep. The next morning I say to him if it help ease your mind please take my phone, I tell him I was venting to my Mum and did not want to make him angry. He said our marriage is over and there should be no private conversation between my Mum and I that he cannot read. He says he no longer wants to see my phone, and that our marriage is over, he then took my phone and threw it across the room. He then said when we return home that he will move me into the spare room and I will start paying him rent. 

The rest of the vacation goes by semi smoothly. There is more name calling. He rated me a 1.4 out of ten. He said that he should pay our friend that was on vacation with $1,000 to sleep with me so that he could get me away from him. I beginning to become very scared of him at this point, he is bad mouthing me to our friends and becoming more nasty. I can feel the cortisol levels rising, I am visibly shaking where my brain is in flight or fight and he is mocking me. I had to get out of the apartment we were staying in, so I took myself down to the beach one morning in a complete state of panic, I have been in an abusive relationship before and I could feel it escalating. In my panicked state I did something I know regret, I reached out to my ex in from England who still resides in the USA, he is the only other person I know from my home country and I was scared. We had been in touch since my new relationship as we still had Financials that we needed to sort out, we had been negotiating that back and forth and it wasn't getting us anywhere, he then began to get personal with it and threaten me with calling immigration due to getting married etc... Anyway at the time even though our relationship did not end amicably and we had not spoken for a while as the negoations had stopped I still phoned him. I was not sure whether to fly back to England at this point of fly back early to the US. He calmed me down and said he would help me, I did not speak to him again while on vacation, it was a moment of me feeling completely overwhelmed and panicked.

We flew home a few days later. And true to his word my husband kicked me out of our room and made me stay in spare room and pay  rent, he said if I didn't make the dates or disagreed with having to do this (as his wife!) that he would have me evicted. I was panicking again at this point. He was going out again and leaving me at home. Threatening to bring other women home in an attempt to get me to leave the home. He said he would bring them home and make sure to have sex with them loudly so I could hear it. He said that he wanted a divorce and if I even dared to go back to England he would hunt me down and my family. He said all I was good for now was to be his f*cktoy and to be used a pincushion as that was all I was good for. I am devastated at this point, I do not want a divorce and I am begging him to reconcile and asking what I can do to make this right and that I will do anything. A few days later he comes home and goes on one of his rants telling me the same stuff he has been for nights on end with it always ending on him no longer wanted to be with me. At the end of this particular tirade it is 2.30am, and he said okay if you will do anything go and get your phone. I want to take it for 12 hours, change the passcode, you can go to work and then go through it together. I say no, this was a very controlling and intrusive ask. And he was asking to rebuild trust when none had been broken and it was purely on his assumptions and insecurities. Him keep looking through my phone is not going to achieve anything. He goes to bed and told me that was my last chance at redeeming anything with him. The next day he is sending me disgusting text messages while in his room and I am in mine, saying how we wants me to leave the home and it needs to happen quickly. He then proceeds to call my Mum in England and asks her how he can get me out of his home. A few days later he goes on a skiing vacation with his friend. I am on my own at this point, still with no vehicle and no way to get to work. My boss has said because of where we lived it was becoming an inconvenience for my colleagues to come out of their way to pick me up. My husband had also called my boss, and he was the one that got me that job as they were good friends. Just a side note I had confided in her with what was happening between my husband and I, not ever did I bad mouth him, I was just looking for some advice as I was scared for my future. And wanted a females perspective of someone who had known him a long time. She was very much on my side and could not believe how he was treating me. However after he called her things dramatically changed and she confessed to him that I had confided in her that he was calling me names etc.. anyway after that phone call and while he was on vacation she ended up letting me go. So now I am in the spare room, mu husband is on vacation so I am on my own, I am being threatened with eviction and divorce and being called names on a daily basis. I have now reached breaking point so I voluntarily took myself into hospital. My husband finds out and accuses me of trying to ruin his vacation calls me a f*king asshole and tells me I am not welcome back into his home. While I'm in hospital again I reach back out to my ex from England and explain your him that we have Financials that need to be taken care of and I need to sign off ASAP as my husband is kicking me out of our home. My ex is supportive and even arranges for me to stay with a friend when I am discharged from hospital.

My husband returns off vacation and comes to visit me once while I'm in hospital, but not because he is concerned but because he wants to tell me how i ruined his vacation and how selfish I am being. A few days later he comes to pick me up, still no concern. He tells me he cannot wait for me to be out of his home. He doesn't care where I am going. He just wants me gone. So he kicks me out, I have most of my belongings in the garage still and he tells me I have a week to collect said belonging or he'll burn them or send them to goodwill. The first night I am staying at my friend's, the first night I have been kicked out but also just landed a new job i call him, tell him I do want any of this and just want to come home as I miss him. He tells me he's out at the bar, it's too cold outside to talk to me right now and that he will call me back tomorrow. At this point I am angry the realization that he's kicked me out, which is illegal in the state that we reside, I am an immigrant and he does not care at all or want to support me. He attempts to call me the next day, I do not answer as I am so upset and angry with his actions. I then recieve paragraphs of messages, telling me how useless I am, that I have had 9 months to prove myself to him and have not done that. If he was to ever consider me continuing to be his wife that I would have to pull my head out of my ass and start acting like one. He called me a six year old child, said all I was good for is sex, called me a lying cheater and the list goes on. This goes on for a week, more insults and out downs. Still threats of divorce and revoking his sponsorship for a greencard. The messages are becoming more threatening as the week goes on and as he has not heard from me he blocks me. I contact the sheriff's department at this point and ask for a civil standby. This makes my husband very angry and he asks why I'm telling our whole town that he is physically abusive and why I am in the fear for my life and telling the sheriff's that. I have never called him physically abusive and never told the sheriff's I was in fear for my life. I wanted a civil standby simply because I did not want to encounter anymore verbal abuse from him. He had progressed to throwing my phone again and attempted to throw a sharpie at me which missed, so things did begin to escalate. Not for one minute did I think he would be physical with me though and that is not why I asked for a civil standby on the day that I went to get my stuff I even said to him that maybe I had overreacted and I would come and get my stuff without them, he said no at that we should just keep to that arrangement. I got my belongings and when I arrived back at my friend's house he had sent messages to let me know he was going to file for divorce, revoke his sponsorship with USCIS and have me deported. Staying with my friend was only a short term arrangement and because of my husband's behavior I spoke to a DV shelter and they said I was definitely eligible to stay there. I ended up staying there for 3 weeks. All the while my husband did not know where I was. He was not concerned for my safety or whereabouts but he was just trying to track me down to serve me divorce papers. He was sending my friend who I had been staying with threats, my ex and other friends threatening and demanding messages to try and locate me. He also had people looking for me around the town we lived in. 

When I left the shelter I came to a friend's house where I still reside now. 

He then sent me this message after I had been there for a couple of weeks

Tic toc Leanne. Make good choices. Or maybe I call ice and show them your hezubla dedication and antisemitic stuff? Trump loves a good terrorist. 

I see why that guy beat you, tortured you, and treated you the way he did. You deserved it. My only wish is he did it more and harder. You deserve everything you get. 🚨🖕🚨🖕🚨👋👋👋

This obviously really scared me, and at this point I had not spoken to him for over a month and a half, as all his messages were of a threatening nature and I had realized quite a few of his tendencies were narcissistic and the best way to deal with that is to go no contact. However that above message made me take action and reach out to a mutual friend as a mediator. My husband and I began talking again. Because I am trauma bonded still I am still begging for him back and asking to come home etc.. he obviously blames me for everything, does not take accountability for his actions and words and says it was all truths and things that I needed to hear and that we meant every word and had no regrets regarding kicking me out. We however agree to meet for dinner, he says I need to pay now and going forward if there is more dates I need to pay for all of those too and earn back his love and trust. Then he changes his mind and says he just wants to meet in for coffee instead. He tells me he is scared of me!?! When I am the one that should be scared! He asks me not to kill him when we meet up! Fast forward to our meeting and it goes well. He just discuss day to day things. 

We carry on messaging and he tells me if we are to make a go of anything we need to be friends first which is obviously not plausible given the fact we are married and in my opinion you either want to try and reconcile or you don't. We agree to meet for a second time for coffee again. We have been messaging between these meetings and he still blames me for everything, and the breakdown of our marriage is because of me. I ask him to please reconsider our marriage and trying to make it work. Anyway I arrive at the coffee shop and there is a guy at the counter that I recognize instantly as the process server as I knew who he was. My husband arrives a few minutes later and I ask him if he is going to serve me which he tells me yes. I get emotional and ask him not to do it. Again he starts blaming me, he said the reason I kicked you out was because you kept begging for another chance and reconciliation and that I was still doing that and nothing had changed so that's why he was proceeding with the divorce. We then left but said he would call me later, we spoke on the phone for another hour. We texted for a while after that with me still trying to get him to reconsider. He then just stopped texting. Then a few days okay he messages asking me if I am okay as he has not heard from me?!? I reply a day later, asking him if he saw a way forward now that he had served divorce papers, and did he feel better about things because I am. He has not responded and that was yesterday. I know that he is seeing someone else who is also going through a divorce and that they have been seeing each other for a few months and were even seeing each other when I was still in the spare room.

I have signed off with my ex partner on the land and the deeds so I have at least gone some money and savings behind me. I have an attorney that is going to help me with a VAWA case and I have been told me case is very strong. I also received an interview for my greencard for marriage which I have rescheduled for now and will obviously put a hold on as I am now changing my status again. I am sorry this is so long. This has been my journey for the last few months and I am devastated. I have been very close to going home but decided to stay as I have dreams here. I still miss my husband and I do not want this divorce at all. I have even said I am willing to forgive everything and move forward and even leave my phone at home while I am at work. I have also told him the only reason I have stayed in this country is for him.",1,1748061817.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/birds/comments/1kicy7i/comment/mreaa86/?context=3)**: 3 hours later**

UPDATE! I bought a little cage (which will stay open) and some food for the time being and have alerted the local pet shop chain that I have the birb and I am going to check tomorrow if anyone loooked for him. Same thing in a couple of shops nearby. He ate his seed and now it seems way more energetic, flying around, singing and exploring. If he ends up staying I am going to name him Seneca!

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: OP, if you're on Facebook, go to 911 Parrot Alert Official and make a post there. Its a group where people post lost and found birds. The admins are members of many ""lost pet"" groups and will cross-post them in wider areas. Birds can travel over many miles so that kind of reach will help.

>**OOP:** Thank you, this has been suggested by multiple people but I do not use Facebook and I live in the North West of Italy, Torino - I think anyway those FB groups work better abroad. I am planning over the weekend to go to the shops, bars, restaurants and cafeterias of my area telling that I have found this beautiful bird and to contact me if the owner shows up looking for him

Commenter: I live in Italy and in my city there is a Facebook group for local missing pets which works very well, give it a try! Or try and contact a local rescuer like ENPA

>**OOP:** Thank you I will look into it!

*To a longer* [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/birds/comments/1kicy7i/comment/mrfqs18/?context=3) *with lots of info about parrots:* 

**OOP:** Thank you for the info! I have two questions, maybe you can help:

* does he need something specific nest-like as a literal bed for sleeping?
* does he need covers or pillows or something else to stay warm? Especially during the night when I will not be able to check on him

Commenter: Where do u live, OP? Since u said bird may be domestic… just wondering where these beautiful birds are local ☺️

>**OOP:** Sorry, English is not my first language, probably I meant domesticated. These birbs are not native of my area, North West of Italy, Torino

**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/1kict40/comment/mrgftor/?context=3)**: 7 hours later**

UPDATE 2 Since I've seen many people worried about the original owners, I want to make clear that my intention is first to look for the owners for at least 1 week, if after that no one ask for him I think I will keep him and that would mean that I would buy a huge luxury cage for my feathered friend!

***Comment:*** 

Commenter: OP you wrote that you are in Italy, maybe check the regulation around parrots there? I think that in Germany you should at least have 2, since they are social animals, but I don’t know if that is an EU regulation.

>**OOP:** I do not know the regulation at the moment but I honestly do not think there is such a regulation here, most likley a guideline. Anyhow my intention is to wait a few days before starting to consider him a permanent roommate, once it is established I will buy a huge cage and will look into finding him a buddy, checkup at the vet and so on!

**Update** [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/birds/comments/1kicy7i/comment/mrk0ghy/?context=3)**: May 10, 2025 (Next Day)**

UPDATE 3 The first night is passed, when I woke him up removing the sheet he chirped and started eating, while I was making coffee. Afterwards I opened the cage and he flew on me, explored a bit my shoulder, my beard and my hair (dreadlocks) and now is napping on my [wrist.Today](http://wrist.Today) I will check again local shops and make a few calls to exotic pets vets to check whether anyone asked for him. [birb day2](https://imgur.com/a/Jr7wFKl)

**Title:** UPDATE:This fella arrived on my balcony and now we are friends

Original post: Hi everybody, i am updating in a new post to put some more photos and to expand a bit. Basically the weekend went great, I purchased a couple more things for his little cage and he is enjoying it, like the rope perch. I put and old sock inside as a plaything but it seemed to me he was attacking it, so to let him relaxed I swapped it woth a piece of paperel, will see what will come! 

We have a lot of fun together, his favourite thing to do is sitting on my shoulder playing with my hair sometimes deafining me with a chirp just beside my ear😂 In the morning when I open his cage I sing to him ""who let the birb out, who who who"" and he sometimes answers vocalizing a bit - very cute. 

But the cutest thing is that he loves cuddles and scratches, if I extend a finger to pet his head he lowers his head to have more and closes his little eyes in bliss, too too cute. He is also a bit of a weirdo, for example when he roams freely sometimes he takes little strolls on the floor and to my inexperienced eye a walking bird is hilarious! In the photos you can see the food I am giving him with ingredients, so you can suggest me anything better if needed. 

I also try to give him fresh fruit but this cute dude seems to like only apples and just a little bit carrots. I have tried with bananas, strawberries, blueberries. He seems visually upset by the berries! 

On the previous owners hunt no updates, no one in the neighborhood has info. I even created a fb account to scan local lost pets groups and no one is looking for a lovebird. So the plan is to look for the owners for a few more days. Luckly in one month and a half I will move to an apartment that's double the size of the current one and there I want to buy a luxury cage, huge one, do you have any specific suggestion? Also, I have recieved different opinions whether to adopt another one or not, I understand that they are social birds but some people stated that if I miss for work he will just get used to it as a routine.

Last but not least important, I am moved by all the kind replies to the original post and even dms giving tips and telling me I am a good human being. I shed a tear, since to me it has literally just been natural and spontaneous to care for him.

Will update again!

I managed not to post the food picture 😂 here it is in the link [food stats](https://imgur.com/a/rqZLjdL)

***OOP responds to people asking about finding the OG owner:*** 

>Hey there, I am replying because this is a common concern but I have written both on the og post and in this one that i am actively looking for the previous owners with no success, both by word of mouth and on fb groups. If no one asks for him I will just keep him  
*To another commenter:*   
I have asked to all shop, including the local pet store chain, bars, supermarket in my neighborhood to spread the word and to call me if anyone asks for a lost parrot, called the (as for my findings) only exotic vet of the area and created a fb account to check lost pet groups of the city and nothing comes up. If the owners show up though I will give them the birb, but I will stop looking for them in a few days🦜

Commenter: Its hard to believe nobody is looking for a bird a sweet as this. Really hoping it wasn't a released bird because somebody no longer wanted to take care of him. If that is the case at least he found you.

>**OOP:** I was thinking maybe some old folks passed and their relatives freed him?

*Bird's name:* 

>His name is Seneca, like the Roman philosopher and play writer!  
*To another commenter:*   
His name is Seneca, often called Senechino since it's small 🦜

Commenter: Just throwing this out there, while leaving the cage open for him to roam is great, DO NOT leave it open at night. Open cage sleeping has a lot of risks and he could severely injure or kill himself if left unattended while you are sleeping. Similarly don't snuggle with him in bed and fall asleep with him, birds have died by being rolled onto because they are fragile and can't fight their way out from under you like a dog or cat.

>**OOP:** Thank you, multiple people gave this suggestion - honestly one of my first thoughts was to doze off with him on me. It's easy to see once you pointed it out how it can be very dangerous. He's free roaming only when I am awake in the house!

Commenter: Needs a much larger cage. The one you have now can be used for travel.

>**OOP:** Yeah, at the moment I don't have much space, I let him out a few hours a day, one hour in the morning and a few more in the late afternoon/evening 🦜 He showed up at the right time I guess since next month I am moving to a bigger place where I will be able to have a huge luxurious cage for him🦜

Commenter: That’s great that you’re taking care of him! Does he exhibit any other concerning behaviors? Like he’s uncomfortable being help? Or wants to fly away? Are his wings clipped?

>**OOP:** He seems healthy and active, he eats, chirps and sinust (more when I am not with him), flies around the room, asks for cuddles on the head... He has a weird aversion to berries, he does not interact with paper nor takes a bath, although he showed some interest in the water stream out of the faucet in the sink. He just likes staying on my hands or shoulder grooming himself or my beard/hair. He likes all physical contact!🦜🦜🦜

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/birds/comments/1koupoh/update2_the_fella_who_arrived_on_my_balcony_is/) **2: May 17, 2025 (5 days later, 8 from OG post)**

Hello eveybody! This is an update about the situation, since many asked, with my new feathered roommate, Seneca!

Previous update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/birds/s/HKsNACGNCS](https://www.reddit.com/r/birds/s/HKsNACGNCS)

First thing first, it's been more than a week now since he arrived in my apartment and I have not found the previous owners. I have checked and looked everywhere I would go if I lost my pet, including fb local groups and local pet stores. No one is looking for a lost bird it seems.

On a sweeter note we are bonding and we have found some kind of temporary routine since until halfway through June we both are a bit restricted on what we can do, the apartment is quite small and I have to go to work anyway.

I wake him up a 7.30/8 am, I clean his cage, change his water and refill his feeders as needed, I also put a few fresh piece of apples/carrots in the cage. I then free him for one hour, I talk and whistle to him and as long as he wants I pet his head and cheeks.

Video of Seneca enjoying the pets: [https://imgur.com/a/wCCH4P0](https://imgur.com/a/wCCH4P0)

Afterwards if he agrees I put him back in the cage and I leave for work. It happened in the most recent days that he understands that I am going out and so he does not responds to me as he otherwise do, flying on the tallest spot of the room and mocking me for my inability to catch him. Since I actually must go to work I have birdproofed a room so I can leave him free without worrying that he might get hurt or making a mess/marking stuff dirty or whatever.

Once I come back, which can be from 5 to 8 hours later, I free him if he's in the cage and spend some more time with him, 3 to 5 hours. During these hours I am not constantly interacting directly with him, for example he sits on my shoulder grooming me while I do PC stuff or while I browse Reddit on my phone. I have found a little game to play with him, he likes to bite the band of my watch, so I hide it to him and he looks for it or I move it around so he chases it.

I then put him back in the cage at 7 pm and I reduce the light in his cage partially covering it. I change his water and fresh fruit once again and between 7.30 and 8 pm I completely cover the cage so he can sleep his 12 hours.

Tips requests and questions below!

* how do you manage your bird poop, the only way I found to minimize the issue is to put below the common places in which he perches something to collect his droppings
* does he get sad from the 5-8 hours in which he is alone and maybe in the cage?
* do you see any flaw in our routine? Is it sustainable for 1 more month? Afterwards he is going to have a lot of space
* he does not seem to play with paper or stuff when alone, how can I be sure he does not get bored when alone?
* what's this fixation he has for my toenails especially but also for my finger nails, he bites them quite hard
* can you explain to me how to see if he is 'hormonal' or not? A bunch of people told me that would be bad, but I am not sure about the signs of it

I am sharing some pictures and stuff and thank you all for the overwhelming love and support you are sending us (a lot of people even told me I am as cute as him 😂)

CHAPTER ONE - ✅

Hart Island is New York City’s mass grave. I’ve lived here my entire life, yet the first time I heard its name was two weeks ago while trying to claim my father’s remains. He went unidentified for weeks, and when that happens, the city buries you there, among the unnamed and unclaimed.

“Name?” says the city clerk at the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, whose name tag reads Myriam.

“I’m Alba. I’m here to confirm next of kin.”

“Of the deceased” she says, this time with a slight edge of annoyance, making it clear that my presence is beginning to wear on her.

“Victor Diaz,” I say, as politely as I can. Already catching on that it’s clear that anything short of sweetness won’t get me far. So, I effortlessly assumed the 'kill with kindness' approach.

“Relationship to the deceased?”

“Daughter.”

I slide the manila folder toward her containing my birth certificate – documentation tying me to my late father. Myriam rifles through the contents, barely skimming them, and places the papers upside down on a flat device next to her screen – a digital scanner, I assume. 

I think of the last time I saw him. It was about five years ago, shortly after he was released from prison due to overcrowding during the height of the COVID pandemic. He was standing outside my apartment building – the one I shared with my then-boyfriend, Wes. I remember it clearly. It was an unusually warm evening for mid-April, and I had stepped out for a walk around the block – the only alone time I could carve out after a long day of working from home. He looked years beyond his age, face gaunt, clothes torn, with a smell that reeked of a combination of alcohol and urine. He was begging me for twenty dollars. Maybe it was pity. Maybe it was shame or the fear that Wes might walk out and see me speaking to a “stranger” in that condition. Whatever it was, I pulled out three twenty-dollar bills and handed it over without a word. But it wasn’t his desperation for money to feed what I could rightly assume was a long-developed addiction or his reappearance after a two-year reduced sentence at Rikers Island that stayed with me. It was what he said: “Another black outfit, huh?”.

He wasn’t wrong. Black has always been my uniform. It doesn’t stain easily, looks elegant in almost every situation, and above all, it’s an architect’s uniform. Even in college, when all the “archie majors” packed into lecture halls, it was a sea of black. That hasn’t changed. In the field, we still wear it like armor.

Black is safe.

Black is confident.

Black is control.

Today, I’m wearing black linen pants, a black cotton turtleneck, black flats, and black sunglasses. And for once, the color is fitting. I am mourning.

“He was interred on Hart Island yesterday.” Myriam says, eyes still glued to her screen. Unbothered by the line that has wrapped around the waiting room for the past two hours since I’ve arrived.

“I’m sorry he’s been buried?”

“Yes. We can release the remains to a licensed funeral home once you make arrangements”

“But I don’t understand. I was told to come in and claim the body with the appropriate documentation to prevent a city burial.”

“When were you told?” Myriam asked. Eyes still never meeting mine but her voice ever so slightly growing annoyed.

“Two days ago. On Monday.”

That was a lie.

I’d known for at least two weeks. My father was never consistent in my life, and when he resurfaced after my college graduation, it was only to tap into my newly minted yuppie income. I thought we were reconnecting – but all he saw was a bank account. I wanted a relationship, and even though I could clearly see his intentions, I ignored them. Until I started setting boundaries. Boundaries that quickly turned into an unspoken ‘no contact.’

Once I noticed the track marks, I stopped contributing to the life he had chosen. And with that, he swiftly vanished. A disappearance I welcomed, even as I suffered it in silence.

I couldn’t confide in Wes – we hadn’t met yet. But even if we had, he came from a world I couldn’t relate to. His parents had been married for over thirty-five years, and the biggest scandal in his family was a cousin dropping out of Stanford Med to become a surf instructor in Maui. When we got together, he didn’t know what SNAP was. Or an EBT card. Or what it meant to rely on supermarkets or churches on select days just to pick up almost-expired food. He never had to cook his own dinner as a child because his single mother was working a double shift. I never told him any of that. How could I? So, when someone you love, like a parent, lives that kind of life – it’s easier to just say you’re estranged. And when my father showed up outside my apartment that day, I chose to leave that encounter out entirely. As far as Wes knew, I hadn’t seen my father since I was a child.

Then there was my mother, who wouldn’t want to hear about my father even if, by some miraculous reason, had turned his life around. For someone so deeply religious, you’d think she might have forgiven him. Asked about him. Prayed for him. But she never did. He abandoned us when I was two years old, leaving behind nothing but debt and a final twist of the knife – she later found out he had another family in Florida. A woman and children he had left us for, but eventually returned to after walking out on us completely.

My mother has never spoken his name since. I admire and fear her stoicism. 

So, I never told her about his return to the city after my graduation. Or during COVID. And I certainly didn’t mention his passing when the corrections officer contacted me two weeks ago. He told me my father had been serving time for petty theft and died of cardiac arrest.

“Why are you calling me?” I asked.

“You were listed as his next of kin.” Said the officer.

“Ok thank you for letting me know.” I expressed in a monotone voice.

“Of course. But miss – if you don’t claim the body in ten days, then the correctional facility will go ahead and direct the body to the city plot,”

“Ok thank you for letting me know.” I repeated.
 
For the next two weeks, I thought about my father constantly. I was already dealing with losing my job, my apartment, and moving back home with my mother – all in the span of two weeks. And now, this. The news of his death layered itself on top of everything else, weighing me down in ways I wasn’t prepared for. I thought about Wes, and how our relationship didn’t survive the stress test of COVID lockdowns. 

A sudden rush of loneliness swept over me. I began to wonder: who’s really there for you in the end? And for a single woman in her mid-thirties, the intrusive thought of ending up alone didn’t seem so far-fetched anymore.

Still, I decided to be there for my father. He wasn’t perfect – far from it. He was the source of much pain and absence in my life. But I wanted to give him a proper goodbye. I wanted to show up. So, on the final day – the tenth and last day to claim his remains, I made my way to the Office of Chief Medical Examiner. Only to learn I was one day too late.
 
Myriam clicks a few times on her mouse, then lets out a dramatic exhale, like she just ran a marathon.

“Arrangements. Okay?” For the first time, she breaks eye contact with the monitor and turns to look at me.

“Is that necessary? I was hoping to manage it myself. You know, cut costs and avoid the funeral home prices. I’m not looking to hold a viewing. Cremation would be fine.”

“And who do you think handles that? Us?” She scoffs.

“Understood,” I say. I know I’m not getting anything else out of her.

“Thank you. I appreciate your—”

“Next,” she calls, already dismissing me.
 
. . .
 
Outside, I’m greeted by a light rain. The kind you can’t really see or hear, but if you try to brave it for a few blocks to the nearest subway, you’ll end up silently soaked.

I pull my phone from my oversized black purse and check the time. It’s 9:50 a.m. I’m calculating how fast I can get from East 26th to East 116th before my 11AM Zoom call.

Train: 45 minutes.

Cab: 30 minutes but add 15 for weather and morning traffic. 

Train: two dollars and ninety five cents. 

Cab: forty-five dollars plus surge pricing for morning rush hour. Plus the comfort of being in my own private car. Plus the unnecessary down-pour on me. 

My money situation was abysmal. Frugality is the new norm. Just three weeks ago, I was living in my dream apartment in DUMBO. Doorman. Amenities. Pool. Parking. All the works that finally let me live the lifestyle I always dreamed of. While most of my friends locked in low mortgage rates in the New York City Metro suburbs, I chose luxury renting. 

I thought I was ahead of the curve and considered myself one of the lucky ones during the Great Real Estate Reshuffle in 2021. What I didn’t expect was the landlord hiking the rent by 20% without warning by 2023. When it was time to renew in 2025, it went up again – twice the amount. The promotion I was promised never came through. My savings evaporated trying to stay afloat until I couldn’t anymore. Pride delayed my exit until I was left with no other option. So here I am. Back in the same room I grew up in, living with my mother.

The subway is the only smart option.

As I descend into the station, I brace myself for the morning rush – bodies pressed close, hot thick air combined with the smell of wet coats. I am mentally preparing for two things: the team Zoom meeting ahead and my mother.

In the design and construction industry, burning bridges is a death wish. Everyone knows everybody. You never know who will end up where, and your name carries farther than you think. Being laid off from my so-called dream job wounded my ego deeply. I was confident – maybe too confident. And confidence, especially from women, is often mistaken for arrogance. After pouring myself into that role, the dismissal left me hollow.

Luckily, connections still count. Francisco – a former colleague – helped me land a new role at his firm. It’s a step down in every way: pay, title, prestige. But it’s something. And today’s our first team meeting.

Then there’s my mother. Our relationship is one that after three and half decades I still fail to understand. She’s the kind of mother who would give her life for mine but shows love through judgment and sacrifice tallies. It’s the immigrant parent script: ""I gave up everything for you."" And she did. Dominican-born, she worked tirelessly to give me a future. To her, success is measured in education, a solid job, a good body, and a marriage by 30. I tick a few boxes, but not all. I can feel her disappointment in the silence, in the sideways glances. She never says it out loud, but her face says enough. And even though I’ve achieved a lot – graduated with honors, built a name in my field, lived on my own – I feel like a failure. 

The move back home was a step backward, not just in life, but in pride. For both my mother, and for me.



CHAPTER TWO - ✅

Fifteen stops and thirty minutes later, I step off the subway at East 103rd Street. I’ve got just enough time to make a pit-stop at the bodega for a much-deserved breakfast. Normally, I’d go for overnight oats, a Siggi’s yogurt, or my latest acquired habit – nothing at all. But waking up at 5:30AM, trekking downtown to open a city building, and standing in line for almost three hours, only to be told I was a day late and penny short to retrieve my father’s remains, calls for some comfort food. And for me, that came in the form of a chopped cheese – a cheeseburger smashed into a sandwich: gritty, greasy, and deeply comforting.

I step into the corner bodega on Lexington and nod to Mr. Rivera, who’s owned this place longer than I’ve been alive. I give him a shy wave and head straight for the fridge to grab an orange juice.

Something about moving back home makes me feel like all eyes are on me – the latest neighborhood gossip. People tend to think of Manhattan as a place where you can disappear into the crowd, but in a tight-knit pocket of Spanish Harlem, it’s the opposite. Here – in El Barrio – as we call it, neighbors still sit on stoops and swap stories. Everyone knows the guys hustling on the corner, the ones outside playing a hand of domino while blasting Bad Bunny tracks, the woman who works nights and keeps to herself, the block tía who is not really anyone’s aunt but knows all your family drama. So, I figured my grand return would stir up a little chatter among the masses or at the very least generate a side-eye or two. 

But none of this has been the case. If anything, I’ve realized people are too wrapped up in their own lives to care. Surviving their own chaos. I have to remind myself of that most days: not everyone is out to get you.
I still find this feeling hard to shake. I spent so long in a work environment constantly second-guessing people’s motives, waiting for the rug to be pulled out from under me – and eventually it was. Now, that same anxiety I experienced at work, has bled into everything else in my day-to day life. I’ve become a more reclusive version of myself, tiptoeing into a mild case of social anxiety that I’ve been able to manage with a low dose of Xanax. PTSD effects of a post-toxic-workplace, I guess.

I walk over to the deli side and place my breakfast order with Manuel – or Manny, as I’ve always called him.

“Hey Manny. Just a chopped cheese.” I say with a small yet genuine smile.

“Coming right up.” he replies. With no side-eyes.

Manny and I grew up together going to the same daycare, same public schools, same neighborhood programs in El Barrio. He was the only boy my mother ever trusted to walk me to and from places. The only one she didn’t question when I said I was spending time with. The only one she truly treated like a son.

Manny was like a brother to me. He taught me which Dragon Ball Z character was the best, got me hooked on listening to Linkin Park, and stood guard when grown men catcalled an obviously underage girl. During hot summers we would play under the opened fire hydrants – our version of a pool – courtesy of Mr. Rivera, who never cared about what the fire department thought despite all the warnings to cease opening them on his own. We shared everything. Our dreams, and our futures. He wanted to be a pilot and I wanted to be an architect. He would mention how he planned to work summers at the bodega to save up for aviation school, and I said my plan was to raise money at church to take drafting classes and learn design software.

But that was all before high school when we ended up at different schools, and like most childhood friendships, separated by distance or social circles, ours slowly faded. We stopped having things in common to talk about and eventually, we stopped talking at all – only catching a glance of each other in passing when out around the block.

For all intents and purposes, we started at the same place – two kids from Spanish Harlem with big dreams. And now I’m back, and I find him right where I left him: behind the deli counter at his father’s bodega.

I make my way to the register, where Mr. Rivera is having a conversation on speaker phone. Something about someone looking for a one-room rental, while complaining everything is out of budget. I place my orange juice on the counter and offer a sympathetic look as I can relate to price hikes.

“Everything is through the roof, nena,” Mr. Rivera says as he rings me up. “Soon they’ll be charging us for the oxygen we breathe.”

I nod and glance down to find bodega cat walking between my legs with its tail hugging my ankles. Wow, someone’s had a few too many meals. I thought to myself.

“That’s all, nena?”

“And a chopped cheese, please.”

Manny walks over and places the sandwich on the counter – no side-eye or any eye contact at all – and walks away. Mr. Rivera places it in a plastic bag as he continues his loud conversation with an even louder person on the other end of the line.

“Dame un minuto” Give me a minute. He says to the person he has on speaker. Then he leans in and says: “Nena, how’s Lourdes? Tell her we’re stocked with the coffee she likes. In fact – hold on.”

He steps down from the counter and disappears down an aisle, returning with a pack of Café Santo Domingo. I hold the bag open, and he drops it in.

“Thank you,” I say, my voice soft.

As I head toward the exit, I stop with one foot out the door and the other firmly inside the corner store.

“Mr. Rivera” I call out. “The cat is laying on the bread again.”
 
…
 
I arrive home with only ten minutes to spare before the call. With no time to eat the chopped cheese, I set it down on the kitchen counter and head straight to my room.

Inside, I slide the manila folder with my birth certificate and other documents into the top drawer, then sit at my makeshift table – half vanity, half desk. I nudge aside a few hair products, push the mirror back, and place my laptop in front. I open the curtains, but the light’s weak, so I switch on the floor lamp beside me.

With five minutes to spare, I open my laptop and log into Zoom, muting both video and audio. While I wait for the meeting time to approach, I close my eyes and slow my breathing. No matter how much of a downgrade this job feels like, it’s still an opportunity.

The same kind of opportunity that once got thirteen-year-old me a scholarship to Wendover Academy – one of the most prestigious high schools in Manhattan. The same kind that earned me a full ride to Cooper Union’s School of Architecture. The same kind that led Maddox Development to offer to fund my master’s in Historic Preservation at Columbia University.

I accepted this job at Jenkins Partners quickly. Mainly because I had racked up debt, assuming a promotion was coming, and second, if I wanted to remain relevant in my field, I needed to take the offer – even if it meant I wouldn’t be designing anything as the lead architect.

The project is a historic landmark in Central Harlem – The Langford – a century-old community library that’s been abandoned for two decades and now, it’s being restored and converted into a museum. Francisco, a former colleague from Maddox, now works at JP – the firm representing the client – the client being the city of New York. He remembered my background in historic preservation, and he knew I was a good fit. He also knew it had been a while since I worked on a project like this. Back at Maddox, he brought in the business, and I designed the visions. After I left, I moved on to VOX Studio, where I designed some of the most innovative, high-budget and high-profile projects of our lifetime.

This new project, Francisco explained, would involve retrofitting and restoring – or as we designers like to say, giving the building a good facelift. Only I wouldn’t be doing the facelift. My title: Historical Liaison. My task: review architectural drawings, engineering plans, and consultant reports to make sure the building’s historical integrity is preserved.

Francisco, ever so kindly, explained that no one at Jenkins seemed particularly eager to take it on. Government jobs come with tight budgets, sluggish approval processes, and a long chain of command. Add landmark status into the mix, and it’s even messier. In a world of sleek private projects and fast-moving clients – the kind I’d grown used to – this kind of work is often avoided.

The offer from Jenkins came in fast, and I wasn’t surprised. I didn’t negotiate – I couldn’t afford to. I needed a job, and I needed one quickly. It was the only opportunity on the table, even if it meant swallowing my pride and taking a pay cut. Not every opportunity needs to be glamourous to be worth taking. I’ve come too far to shrink in the face of something smaller than I hoped for – but that doesn’t quiet the feeling that somehow, I’ve fallen short.

I catch myself biting my cuticle – a tell-tale sign I’m nervous. At least I’m not reaching for a Xanax, I think. I glance at the Zoom waiting room: eight names. One minute until 11:00AM.

I check myself in the mirror propped behind my laptop, fluff my shoulder-length black curls, refresh my blush-toned lipstick that looks natural against my cinnamon skin. I take a breath and click “JOIN CALL”.

I’m the first one in. But soon, everyone else starts shuffling in.

Francisco quickly starts with intros, and I follow along looking at everyone sitting in their virtual box, unintentionally sizing them up – something I’ve learned to do over years of kicking off new projects with new faces.

There’s Sean Merrick, the general contractor. He will probably always be early – something characteristic of the boots-on-the-ground type.

Darius Lang, the MEP engineer – the kind always racing toward a hard stop, jumping into the next call, the next client, the next project. I’ve never understood when they actually find time to engineer anything at all.

Then there’s Theo Calder, the architect – a well-known name in the industry, though we’ve never crossed paths. And now, instead of contributing to the design, I’m expected to quietly observe and resist the urge to critique.

Jordan Holt from the furniture design team – a woman, I think to my delight. Though, if I’m honest, most people would probably say it’s a fitting role.

And finally, there’s H. Zamora with the camera off. Francisco mentions he’s the structural engineer. Maybe he’s just shy, I think. Still, it’s unusual to go dark for a kickoff call.

Just as quickly as introductions were made, Francisco jumps straight into the scope.

“We will be restoring the historic features of The Langford – which includes cleaning and repairing the stonework, windows, and original detailing,” he explains. 
“But we’ll also need to retrofit with modern systems, plumbing, HVAC, electrical. Add elevators and ramps, reinforce for heavy exhibits, install security, fire protection, all while preserving the building’s soul.”
 “To help us with these efforts, we have with us my colleague Alba Diaz, our Historical Liaison.”

The call goes quiet. And I assume this is Francisco’s way of giving me my cue to jump in. But what could I possibly say at this point?

“Hi everyone,” I say, giving a small smile. “I’m excited to work on this project with all of you.” Not knowing what else to add. I sit back and put the ball back on Francisco’s court to continue.

“Well, thank you for –” Francisco says before he is interrupted.

“Excuse me,” a man’s voice cuts in. “How will you address the proper restoration of the polychromatic brick façade on top of stone?”

I turn my attention to Theo, since this seems like an appropriate question for the architect, but he doesn’t say anything at all.

“Ms. Diaz?” says the same voice.

I jolt, just slightly – then roll my shoulders back and respond calmly.

“Well, I suppose –”

“What’s your level of confidence that the façade can actually be retained without shoring?” the voice interrupts again, which now I can clearly see that it is coming from the black video box with the name H. Zamora.

“Well, um – Mr. Zamora, my intention is to –”

“I understand these may require physical observation, but these are the kinds of questions that delay structural decisions,” he says, cool and clipped, talking through me, not to me.

I’ve seen this before. Women steamrolled in meetings. I glance toward Jordan for a sense solidarity, but she’s nodding – an indication that she’s aggreging with H. Zamora.

I internalize the disappointment as I remember that I’m on camera. I smile and begin to say: “Mr. Zamora, I –”

“We intend to do a full site analysis a week from today.” Francisco cuts in, smoothly. “We’ll have answers for you and the team by then.” He says.

My mouth’s still open. I decide to say something, even if I have to muscle my way through with a one full sentence.

“Preliminary.” I say, firmly. “We’ll have preliminary answers after the building inspection.”

My expression is calm. But my pulse is racing. My palms are sweating. And just like that, I wish I had taken the Xanax.

Francisco wraps up the call, sets the site visit for the following week, and everyone begins the process of saying goodbyes and signing off.

“Thanks, everyone. Alba, can you hang back a sec?” Says Francisco as the others continue to drop off.

“What the hell was that?” I ask, right after the last person leaves. “Who is that guy?”

“Who?”  Francisco says, as if I just asked him about someone from a distant past.

“Zamora!” I say wide-eyed and with a hint of annoyance that he ended up getting under my skin after all.

“Oh, Hugo? Don’t take it personally. He’s always like that. Likes to drive the conversation.”

“More like run it over,” I mutter, rolling my eyes.

“Anyway,” Francisco says, pivoting, “I wanted to ask if you’re comfortable leading the site visit next week. I’ve got a scheduling conflict.”

“Of course. No problem.”

“Great. I’ll text you the code for the lockbox. You’ll let everyone in and if you can, try to swing by before then – get the lay of the land. That way, you’ll have the upper hand on Hugo. He hasn’t seen or been inside the building yet.” He says with a smirk.

That’s what I’ve always appreciated about Francisco. His breezy confidence that things will work out – and the respect he extends me, even when others don’t.
We hang up. And despite the rough moment, the meeting was productive. And put into perspective – it’s the least dramatic thing that’s happened to me all month.

I stand and stretch as my stomach lets out a loud growl. It’s 12:15PM, and I’ve been up since 5:30AM without a single bite to eat. I head to the kitchen, unwrap the chopped cheese, and take a bite. Cold or not, I’m too hungry to care. Halfway through my breakfast-turned-lunch, my phone buzzes. A text from Nia lights up the screen.

NIA J. [Wednesday, October 1, 12:25PM]: Don’t forget about happy hour.

NIA J. [Wednesday, October 1, 12:26PM]: And no “I lost track of time” nonsense.

So you see, they set up security cameras in their house. Their house was a three-story house that we built onto. We built the bottom two stories as the first story, the highest story was already there. we had only lived in the house for around a year to two years when things started happening. Nothing happened to any of us in particular except for my grandma. but she installed security cameras in the house and caught a few strange things… She can't voices, one of them was in their bedroom, and the camera turned on as it's motion sensing and you hear a woman's voice whisper Linda, then another time you see, my grandpa come downstairs, to the basement, where we lived, and exit through the back door and then you hear a male voice, sighing, it sounded like it was in it's a late 30s, but there was no other men present at their house when that happened. I always felt watched in the basement, it wasn't even really a basement. If you saw it you could probably tell that it was the bottom story, but it didn't particularly look like a basement. It had wide windows and a whole bunch of natural light pouring in from almost all sides. I also heard children's lullaby from my room when I was alone downstairs at one point, the thing that happened to my grandma was she had a dream about her mom, that has been dead for around 10 years, she dreamed that she forgot her mom., And she went into her closet and found an R, a paper R, her name was Ruth. There was no way that I could've gotten there, especially since she had just woken up and went into the closet to get clothing. None of us were at the house at that time and my grandpa was in the living room, making coffee. There was no way you could've fallen off any shelves as it was perfectly in the middle of the floor centered. I don't have any of the videos of the voices, but I seen them. The ghosts never really did anything to hurt us or anything. I don't even know how they got there in the first place. has anyone have any experience like this?",1,1748061325.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

and I swear I’m not trying to rush things,
but I couldn’t help sitting with a thought—
because, in truth,
I’ve only scratched the surface when it comes to understanding you.

I dont know how you take your coffee or tea,
nor how you like your food served.
I don’t know what truly gets under your skin,
or what runs through your head when you go quiet.

And somehow,
those feel like the most important things in the world right now.
Well—maybe second to how your hair looks messy in the morning.
Or what makes you laugh so hard it turns into tears.
Or what makes you laugh while you’re already crying.

Or which side of the bed feels like home to you.
Or how you look when you’re sleeping like a baby.
What your comfort movies are.
Who your idols have always been.

And yeah, I know—we’ve talked deeply,
but not meticulously.
And lately, everything feels a little blurred.

In the middle of all that,
my mind contemplates—
what your favourite destination might be,
where I’d take you out if I had the chance.
And the thought:
if we ever sat across from each other in silence,
would it still echo comfort?


I wonder what the unfiltered you looks like—
if that version would smile at flowers
if I ever showed up with some.
If she’d smile seeing me all smitten.
If she’d mind me leaning in to steal a kiss.

It’s strange—how your voice plays on a loop now.
Soft. Familiar.
Even though we’re technically still strangers at best.

Yet I’m curious.
And no, I probably won’t say this out loud.
Not yet.
Maybe not ever.

But if I’m being honest—
everything that matters to you
feels like something I genuinely want to care about.

Or maybe…
that’s my way of whispering 
how much I love you.",26,1748061274.0,UnsentLetters,7,1.0,False

Im pretty sure he was studying independently because one day when Aizawa commented on how young Izuku looked to be working there and Izuku said he was but had completed his studies. In the first few chapters he saved Eri and she grew attached to him and he did not know where else to send her so she stayed with him.
So when Eri is sleeping he’d go out and come back late or injured and Eri knew what he was doing and would help tend his wounds but would scold him.
After a while Izuku caught principal Nezu’s attention and they (Nezu and the pro heros) would come across Deku (i think his name was like rabbit? im not sure) and they think he’s a young adult and find him interesting. They set up a meeting and Nezu wants Izuku to teach or help teach at UA and stop being a vigilante

I heard it like twenty years ago from a YouTube video, and that video was literally the ONLY example of that song on YouTube at all. Seriously, I tried finding a lyric video for it maybe a week after I first heard it and there was nothing.

The song sounds like something from All Time Low’s “Put Up Or Shut Up” (aka VERY early ATL, like pre-2008), complete with sounding like Alex himself is singing it. It sounded similar to “Dear Maria”, “Poppin’ Champagne”, and “Coffee Shop Soundtrack”. The lyrics I remember clearly, which I believe is part of the chorus, are as follows:

“They’re out on the town, the next rockstars
They’re all driving out in their cars”
(Last line of the song is a drawn out “teenagers!”)

Now, the second line of that could possibly be “they’re out driving ‘round in their cars”, as I admit the quality wasn’t the absolute best and I have always had a little trouble understanding what’s being said/sang in songs with certain tempos and sounds.

[This](https://www.jammable.com/conversion/jam-JWs6kJXn) is my best impression of how the parts I remember clearly sounded. I recorded myself singing it and used an AI thing to make it sound like Alex, which it did in the actual song (the voice is not an EXACT match, it’s a bit higher pitched in the song and is better quality; Just listen to “Poppin’ Champagne” for a nearly identical voice match if the clip isn’t close enough for you).

The video the song was in was one of those AMVs with random anime pictures, and, well, please understand that I was a VERY strange child and did not find this weird at the time but I do now, all of those pictures were spanking related. I was only on that video for the song, not the pictures, but I figure that telling you the content of the video may help here.

Please, if you know what this song is, tell me! I’ve spent hundreds of hours trying to find even a microscopic trace of its existence on at least a dozen different search engines, including some Tor/deepweb exclusive ones, and come up with zilch. My health isn’t getting better and I want to find this song before my time on this earth comes to an end (which hopefully won’t be for many more years, but unfortunately I have conditions that can easily bring on my end at any time with little to no warning).

1ku38sq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ku38sq,"ALL NEW R3BEL CRT Delta Skins complete with REFLECTIVE BEZELS and OVERSCAN! For iOS, iPadOS, and even macOS!","**\[R3BEL CRT GAMEPAD\] \[R3BEL CRT PORTABLE\]** for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS!  [Download \[R3BEL CRT GAMEPAD\] and \[R3BEL CRT PORTABLE\] Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KzdDTsyJ6YPraAVbaIETkQCX65Xo-u06?usp=share_link)

2 months in the making and they’re finally ready! These are some of my most complex skins to date! They are CRT style skins that use Core Image Filters to distort the game screen to create a bubble style screen similar to the old CRT televisions. They also feature a reflective bezel, mirroring the game image on the inner edges of the screen bezel (not compatible with macOS version). They are definitely not perfect CRT's, but seeing that Delta does not support actual third party shaders this is the closest I could get. 

**RELEASE NOTES:**

1. The CRT GAMEPAD versions are meant for use with Bluetooth controllers, Backbone, etc
2. The CRT PORTABLE versions have complete control sets to play on the go
3. Currently only available for NES and SNES, however N64 is still in the works. There may be a SEGA version as well, but I currently don’t have access to the SEGA emulator to test.
4. iPhone versions only supports edge-To-Edge iPhones (no home buttons)
5. In addition to the labeled quick utility functions there is also a hidden ""Hold to FFW"" button on top of the game screen/display 
6. There are also invisible combination buttons (A+B, L+R, etc) located just around the ABXY Cluster, See image below for button mapping location. 

**OVERSCAN:**

* NES Version has a single overscan which is cropped in by 8pixels on all sides. Top 8, Bottom 8, Left 8, Right 8. (8888)
* SNES Version has 4 overscan versions available to use for different games. 
   * Each skin is labeled with numbers in this format \[0000\], with the first two digits being the top and bottom edge cropping and the last 2 digits being the left and right edge cropping. \[TBLR\]
   * 0000: No cropping at all. Just the standard screen that Delta presents
   * 2244: Cropped in by 2px on the Top and Bottom and by 4px on Left and Right Sides
   * 8222: Cropped in by 8px on Top, and 2px on Bottom, Left and Right sides
   * 81022: Cropped in by 8px on Top, 10px on Bottom, and 2px on Left and Right sides (this one was minimally tested on Chrono Trigger)
   * If you are not sure which overscan to use, try starting with \[2244\]. This is compatible with the most number of games. Or use \[0000\] to just stick with the standard no crop of the screen. 
   * *If you have any requests for specific games to crop out the black borders that these do not work for. Please let me know.* 

As always, feedback is always welcome. Good, bad, or ugly. all is welcome ;)

1ku38mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadBosses/comments/1ku38mu/fired_by_ambush/,Fired by Ambush,"I work somewhere I don't really want to disclose. It's nothing illicit, it's just that it happened recently and I don't want anyone at work finding out. Take Dave, Dave runs a big department store filled with all sorts of jewellery and perfume. Not really, but you know when you go into those big expensive department stores like the Bay or Hudson's Bay it might be called, and there are different counters selling perfumes because they are owned by different companies? That's the most convenient comparison I can think of. 


There's a woman called Judy and a man called Pete. Judy and Pete own one company and four counters, Dave for sure owns one counter but I think he owns two others. So that's seven counters in total. Judy runs one counter, Pete another, and someone very close to both of them runs a third, we'll call him Steve. The third one has a second counter that sells a different product but it's still the same company, another person can work there but it doesn't get much business.

Then there's my dad and I, we work at the highest grossing counter, Dave's counter, in Dave's business. My dad has been in sales most of his life and he's passed om a lot of his tricks to me, he's a pro, I'm just a novice but I've been selling other items with him for years in other department stores.

Last year we were the highest grossing counter, this department store can travel BTW. Judy and Pete are the bosses of the counters because Dave is too busy with the department store. So anyway, my dad and I come in almost late yesterday because Judy told my dad work started at 3pm when it really started at 12pm. I check another source and it states that work starts at 12pm. So off to work we go, not expecting what happened. I get to the counter, Judy and, we'll call her Lisa are behind the counter setting it up. Judy looks startled and says to me, ""Oh did your dad get my text?"" My dad received no text saying we opened at 12pm instead of 3pm or any other text from her. Though I did check with another worker who told me that we did almost start at 3pm.

I get in the counter and put my backpack away, still wondering why Lisa is there but not saying anything. Judy tells me, ""Lisa is going to work this side."" (There are not two sides to the counter, it becomes an instant competition if two peopleare forcedto work there.) I asked her what she meant and Judy says, ""Did your dad not tell you?"" I said my dad doesn't know. My dad shows up and Judy tells him, he has the reaction you would expect of being fired on the spot. But no, no, it's OK. Because Lisa is going to work one side of the counter, and my dad and I work the other side. We don't split the profits, we fight for customers. None of the other counters have to compete, each counter is run by one person. (We work in commission.)

Judy says she's putting Lisa on the counter because profits have gone down which I don't believe for a second. Last weekend, sure I'll buy it, but in total, no way. It's also been not busy and we've had bad weather. So here's the thing, I got into this for my dad, I don't earn any money that's our agreement. I don't need it but he does. Plus I'm young, I can stand at a counter for 12 hours without many breaks but my dad is in his 60s and in very poor health and he needs a lot of rest. He takes naps in the van. Well all these greedy busy bodies took notice, kept asking me where my dad was, I would say in the bathroom, or went for a coffee, or around. What else could I say? But as long as one of us is there it is OK. We're a unit my dad and I. We did this last year when it was cold and not busy and it wasn't a problem. When it's cold and not bust there are nit enough customers to justify two people at that counter which I'm unreliable told by Judy and Pete need two people to run.

When it's nice weather and busy we are both at the counter. I had a great time travelling with my dad and making memories especially now that I know his time is very short. And these people are taking that away from me, and the excuse they give is that we are under performing. Judy claims that she told my dad that Lisa would be working at the counter last week but I doubt that. My dad says she could have said that because his cognitive abilities are declining but I really think that if she said that my dad would have done a double take and said wtf?

And how about mentioning it to me? You're not going to tell me there's someone I have to work next to for five months? You had to wait until the last second?

 I'm sure I'm not including everything but I don't feel good and I just want to get this posted and idk, get some support? Or criticism? Nothing like this happened to me before.

P.S. Lisa is a meth head and runs to Judy everytime she has a problem instead of discussing it with me.

Edit: From grammar and clarity, one of us was fired because now we don't get all the profits from the counter, we have to compete for customers. All names are fake. There is no HR.",2,1748061054.0,BadBosses,0,1.0,False

i got a spine. a stronger one. 

 [my previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/s/3QB2yYj2Bg)

first and foremost, 
i looked up residency laws in my state- under 90 days there’s no residency rights+ you need proof like mail or a lease tied to  my address- he had neither. therefore he had zero right to our apartment! 

anyways, i said in my last post that i  gave him an ultimatum between june 5th or june 15th. i planned to stick to this, hoping to get the extra $200 if he decided to stay until the 15th. i gave him this ultimatum last friday. 

WELLLLLL that following monday my friend, D,  confided in me about something he attempted to do and i snapped out of it. whatever kind of spell he had over us i was shoved out once i learned. while i don’t feel comfortable sharing WHAT it was, it was not great and heavily triggered all of us. actions that i simply cannot let be explained away or given excuses for. 

after my friend told me, i immediately became cold towards him and avoided him like the plague. i couldn’t even stand to look at the creep. 
i still had to pretend that everything was okay because i was so anxious about  the confrontation without prep. 

tuesday comes around and G is still being possessive towards D and tracking her. her and i spent the morning out getting coffee and planning out how we’d go about getting him out. we had to lie and say we had errands to run but we just sat outside safeway and talked for ~2 hours. 

i decided that i needed to confront him when i got home from work that day-because i didn’t need the stress of doing all this before my shift started. talk about draining drama. 

next thing i know, im at work and D is messaging me: “G notices yall are ignoring him…he said he is gonna talk to yall.” (not in a mean way but like a warning). all day while i was at work he was cleaning the house, im talking dishes, mopping, taking out trash…all a manipulation tactic. 
that morning he also swept right in front of me as i was doing laundry and was like “im cleaning see :)” AND also said to me at some point around that time “i used headphones last night to watch my show so it wasn’t as loud!” 

1) this guy should’ve been cleaning sooner. he never did dishes once outside of this. never swept, never mopped, never even wiped off the ash off my TV stand from his bowl piece. 

2) what happened to blasting the TV really loud?? the volume was ~30 at 11pm….we are in a one bedroom so this is really loud. i would constantly have to tell him to turn it down and he’d say “i can barely hear it” and wouldn’t turn it down below 20 unless my fiance grabbed the remote himself and turned it off- 

either way, he detected that something was off from us and he was texting D all day saying stuff like “im gonna throw up” “im gonna cry” “im so scared to talk to them” etc. completely blowing her phone up even though she also had work that day and was very busy. 

my fiance comes home from work before me and immediately as he walk inside G bombards him and starts apologizing- 

G: “i’m sorry for the disrespect i’ve been showing towards you guys…i hope you can see the changes ive made”

My fiance: “okay thanks :)” 

my fiance texts me about this and im thinking grreeaatttttt…..can’t wait to be home. 
my time to shine comes to and im on my way home from work, shaking but not nearly as much as the first time i confronted him. i was truly ready to clock this dude. 

i get home, hit a snapper, change my clothes and wait on my bed for him to have something to say. roughly 5 minutes pass and i’m waiting in anticipation, my RBF locked in…he enters the room all shaky with his shoulders down and hands clasped together. 
G: “hey, can i talk to you?”

Me: “sure.”

G: “well i just wanted to say that i’m very sorry for how ive been treating you guys and your home, i know ive been disrespectful and im sorry….” (starts fucking TEARING UP!!!!) 

Me: “i understand that you’re sorry and i can forgive the disrespect you’ve had towards me, my fiance and our home BUT the harm you tried to exhibit towards D is absolutely foul and unacceptable and i will not allow someone like that in my home” 

i won’t disclose the full details of the convo as to not give the exact event for protection of D BUT he said  full chest that he didn’t and would *never* do “that” and that D was a liar. 
while he was saying these things he was choking up and yet no tears were forming. almost like he knew his lie wasn’t believable. 

THIS sent me the FUCK off- i said PAUSE! let me record this…i am so serious when i say that turned on my camera and said “say it again” 
and TEN TOES DOWN FULL BOLD CHEST HE SAID IT AGAIN “she did XXX so therefore i didn’t do XXX”  TO THE CAMERAAAAAAAA

i burst out laughing because i was literally so flabbergasted….the video ended up being ~10 minutes long and full of him saying bullshit that we both knew wasn’t true. by the end of the video/convo he was saying stuff along the lines of  “I PROMISE I WOULDNT I PROMISEEEE IM SO ALONE NO ONE BELIEVES MEEEEEE IM NOT A BAD GUY I WOULD NEVER DO THAT” 

i was soooo livid and yelled at him to get out, that he he had until 11PM and i best not hear his whiny cry baby ass sobbing to in my living room. of course his googoo gaga ass stayed until 10:50PM…suspiciously though he was on the phone with a lot of people while packing.

i told him he wouldn’t be getting the $400 he paid us for rent because how long he was staying here equated to $20 a night, which is cheaper than any hotel and he can suck my salty nuts if he thinks he’ll even get a penny back. he didn’t argue against this which made me smile. 

luckily G was with another friend for support away from here while this whole thing was going on, but still, i immediately send the recording to D because i knew G would immediately start messaging her.….which he did. “do you hate me” “im sorry im such a bad person” etc. 
i encouraged her to block him, which she did and im so proud of her for doing that despite the lack of complete closure. 

sadly she forgot to block him on IG  and he started mass sending her tiktoks and ig reels with audios like “when you know you knowwwww” (lana del ray) with captions like “i will always love you forever, im sorry i hurt you” and other cringe middle school ass phrases. lord it was hilarious to watch.

of course he made a big deal the next day and texted G on other socials (found her on FB, they weren’t friends on there) and sent her texts like
“i survived the night”
“i miss you” 
“are you leaving me alone forever now”. etc. 

WE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT HE SPRAYED HIS OWN MF PILLOW IN HIS COLOGNE AND LEFT IT FOR HER ANDDDDDD ON TOP OF THAT TOOK HER WATER BOTTLE WITH HIM!! he was really thinking he had the perfect reason to see her again and return it! she bought a new one lol. 
here). 

AND NOW HERE WE ARE! all that shit was fucked and i’m sooooo glad that he is out. FINALLY we have peace in here. i’m spiritual so i immediately washed anything physical that he touched (that i could) and cleansed my house and let the light and air in and etc. and the air feels lighter. the energy is better and my stress hives are gone! 

thank you all for the support and if you got to the end of this post thank you for being a real one lol. 
this is hopefully my final update.

1ku33zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/deism/comments/1ku33zz/pandeism_and_the_coming_death_of_scott_adams/,Pandeism and the (coming) death of Scott Adams,"Scott Adams is probably best known for being the cartoonist who created *Dilbert*, and later getting super-political. But in 2001 he did something very different -- publishing *God's Debris*, a novella which introduces decidedly Pandeistic ideas through a thought experiment: the titular ""God,"" seeking to experience all possibilities, “blows itself up” into the Universe, becoming its very fabric, with ourselves as unwitting expressions of it. This concept captivated quite a few readers, some of whom recognized this as an expression of Pandeism (pantheistic Deism).

And so, whenever Adams garners attention in the news, good or bad, Pandeism sees a similar surge in interest.  With Adams’ announcement on May 19, 2025, that he has metastatic prostate cancer and expects to live only until this summer, the effect has been dramatic. Visits to various websites discussing Pandeism ( e.g., [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandeism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandeism) ) tripled for the next several days.

Adams’ prognosis, shared on *Real Coffee with Scott Adams*, has thusly sparked discussion, not only as to his declining health, but as to his intellectual legacy as well. He revealed that his cancer has spread to his bones, mirroring former President Biden’s diagnosis, and expressed plans to use California’s aid-in-dying law, expecting to “check out” by summer’s end. This has brought renewed focus to Adams’ work, including *God's Debris* (which he recently tweeted a reminder about himself). If his path goes as predicted, media coverage could push interest in Pandeism to unprecedented levels.

If the media remembers *God's Debris* (and acknowledges its Pandeistic nature), this might become the “Summer of Pandeism,” finally propelling the concept out of its usual ivory tower confines and into the broader public consciousness, where it could at last sustain itself indefinitely, as people grapple with Adams’ ideas on divinity, existence, and our Universe’s nature.",2,1748060583.0,deism,0,1.0,False

1ku33i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ku33i0/playing_japan_on_hard_mode_vegan_trans/,"Playing Japan on hard mode - Vegan, trans, neurodivergent","Hi all! On the flight back to the UK after about 3 weeks in Japan! Tokyo, Hokkaido, Sendai. I traveled with my husband and wanted to share my experiences! I'm not a very negative person, and have very little negative to say, so I'll just do a couple negative bits, and then onto positives and vegan restaurant recommendations! ❤️ 

1. It's hot. Really, fucking hot and humid. I found myself getting overwhelmed and awful lot, thankfully 
- most flagship stores have seats and are well air-conditioned 
- It's easy to find ice cold drinks everywhere. 

2. Toilets are great, but the lack of soap is a bit jarring. Just bring some sanitizer or soap in your bag and you'll have a better, cleaner time. <3 

3. If you're vegan, check EVERYTHING! There are many taken-for-granted vegan things in the UK that contain fish in japan. Some I would describe as borderline completely illogical. Just check - I'm not very strict in my veganism but my husband is (he gets quite ill if he eats meat] so, just check everything. 

That's literally it for negatives! No issues at all with queerness (I don't pass) with immigration or using bathrooms - just kept quiet and respectful and used facilities when I needed them and left. No problems. As for neurodivergancy, I found the structured approach to a lot of things helpful - crowds were overwhelming and we did have to dip back to the hotel to decompress a few times. 

I mostly stayed in Tokyo, so my recommendations are for there. 

VEGAN RESTAURANTS! 

Taito Bon - Asakusa: Deeply, truly special. Affordable, 8-course meal inspired by an authentic vegetarian buddhist tradition. The rooms are private and quiet, and the staff were amazing. 10/10 - MUST RESERVE  

Kobiko Organic Wine and slow food - Cute lil restaurant in shinjuku, slow food, just a sweet old japanese lady cooking your 6 course meal one at a time. Set aside a few hours but it was so fresh and worth it. 

Teamlab Planets Vegan Ramen - Genuinely a surprising one, but by far the best ramen we had in Japan. Deep umami, seasonal veggies and a rich broth with hint of yuzu. 

NeoShinjuku - Cyberpunk Izakaya, all vegan menu. Worth it for vibes but food was incredible too. 

Inclusive restaurant - Terminal 3 henada - Henada airport has a surprising amount of great restaurants, and we had a phenomenal vegan cutlet curry as we had time to kill before security. Super worth it if you're there and want some scran. 

BARS! QUICK TOP FIVE! 
Im a bartender, and basically visited for this reason, so... 

A BAR SLEEPING TALES - Beautiful, tiny bar, bartender makes an assortment of homemade ingredients and is so so kind. 
VIRTU - Pricey, but the best view in Tokyo IMO and best service, 10/10 cocktails. 
SUNFACE SPIRITS BAR - Kind, warm bartender in small space. Omakase, no menu. Mezcal and rum specialty. 
JEREMIAH - Great drinks but even better experience. Bartender gave us a tour of the bar, let us pose with his actual freaking katana sword and gave us a world-class flair show. Immense kindness and above and beyond service. 
Any bar down Golden Gai - okay, a cop out. But we had a rule and would just pick any place that was empty, there was a surprising amount. I think some people are afraid of empty bars. We found two that had no cover charge, no gimmick or anything, just local spirits and local people and we managed to communicate just fine. We even drew one of the owners of one of the smaller bars we went to and she was so sweet and poured us all some lovely local booze for us to toast to. Just, go, explore, have fun! 

COFFEE! 
I'm also a coffee nerd, and in three weeks, I visited two coffee roasteries a day. Yup, every day. There were a lot that were great, but one truly stood out to me... 

COVERT COFFEE. The attention to detail here is insane; and like, y'know how sometimes you smell a coffee and read the notes and are like, nah mate? Well, here, each coffee had a truly unique profile.

I think all in all I visited about 30 coffee roasteries and literally none of them were bad. Pro tip: google ""coffee roastery"" instead of ""cafe/coffee shop"" and you tend to get more artisan, craft places. 

ASK ME ANYTHING! Happy to answer! I had an amazing time and hope others can too!

Apologies in advance for *another* recommendation post, but I’ve gone through a bunch and still feel like I could use your expert advice on something a little more unique. We just bought a new house (yay!), and we’re moving in mid-June... but we literally need *everything* fridge, washer, dryer, coffee machine, toaster you name it, we need it.

A few curveballs to help guide your wisdom:

* **I’m new to the U.S. (moved from the UK),** so I’m still learning where to shop and how deals/deliveries work. Can I schedule delivery for mid-June if I buy now?
* **Laundry setup:** I was leaning toward LG for washer/dryer. I know Speed Queen is popular here, but I want the modern features (Wi-Fi, large capacity). Also are laundry pedestals worth it? I do not want a stack type and prefer front loaders! The laundry room is big too so size isnt an issue for me.
* **Buying from Costco?** Their return policy is amazing, and they seem to have some solid deals running. Would love to hear which models are best value vs. just expensive.
* **We also have access to the LG partner site. S**o if that unlocks anything extra good, let me know.
* **Steam closet/dryer cabinet recs?** Worth it or not?
* **Fridge freezer help:** We’ve got a built-in-style cutout with a max space of:
   * Width: 36""
   * Height: 69 1/4""
   * Depth: ideally 29 3/16""
   * The rest of the kitchen is Whirlpool (dishwasher, oven, microwave, stove top), so I’m torn between sticking with Whirlpool or going for something like the Samsung Bespoke series. Anyone compared the two or found killer deals? I dont mind any other brand you might recommend Open to anything!
* **Everything else:** I need suggestions on *all the small stuff* too toaster, kettle, coffee machine, etc. What are your must-haves? What’s wowed you recently?

Bonus points if you can drop links or call out current deals/models you love. I’m happy to spend a bit more if it’s truly worth the upgrade just trying to find the sweet spot between value and quality.

Thank you all so much in advance I know these posts are common, but I’m grateful for any help! Hoping to make smart buys without going totally mad in the process 🙏

Reallly thank you though im going mad trying to find information about so many things at once and then trying to find good deals on that item and than trying to make the right decision on price vs quality. Truly do appreciate your help!",3,1748060498.0,Appliances,4,1.0,False

1ku31bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mother-Effective-797/comments/1ku31bp/hunger_of_the_well_part_3/,Hunger of The Well (Part 3),"I invite you to hear my futile screams as they echo into eternity. That is, if you're so inclined to suffer the knowledge I wish I could trade for your ignorance. Perhaps you can tell yourself I'm merely a madman, or that this is an elaborate lie. Whether or not you believe me is irrelevant. After all, there is only one fact you need to remember if you are to understand the point to all this. There is only one thing I wish for anyone to take away from this story.

First and foremost, I am a coward.

I spent every morning for a few weeks waking up on the dusty ground around the well. Those waking moments were the least drunk I'd be during those times. Every sunrise would bring a short period of time when I'd be confronted with the vibrant memory of my brother going over the side of the well. I could almost hear the sounds of feral mastication, every meaty crunch of bones cracking beneath ragged flesh echoing in my mind. I'd push myself up, look down at the empty bottle in my hand, and go inside to resume drinking.

I used to look at the farmhouse as a happy memory. I could still picture Danny and I running around the corn fields and my mother happily watching over us from the porch with our grandparents standing behind her. That happy place had become nothing more to me than a massive tombstone rising up from the ground now. Every step to my front door was haunted by the knowledge of what composed the foundations of this place. The happy memories I once held so dear had been buried alongside so many others within the mass grave I had come to live upon.

Some nights, I'd stumble out into the field, the path to the well lit by the moon like a beacon guiding me into Hell. I'd approach that profane altar and stand poised upon its lip. I'd walk around the edges, bottle in hand while hoping my foot would slip. I'd fantasize about going over the edge only for everything to stop. No more pain. No more shame. I'd balance on a single leg and take a long drink from the bottle of liquor in my hand. I'd drink until the dreamless sleep that I hoped death would be like would overtake me. Then, I'd wake up on the ground, preparing to do it all over again.

This continued, until I woke up before the sunrise one morning, pushed myself up, looked at the empty bottle, then noticed the old man watching me while leaning against that damn well.

“Good morning,” I croaked with a half wave before pushing myself up to my feet.

The old man lifted his hand to acknowledge my wave and I got a good look at him. He was large, but not fat, just very broad all around. His ruddy skin was a testament to years spent toiling in fields living the life of a farmhand. He was wearing a flannel shirt buttoned up to his neck as well as a leather jacket over it and faded blue jeans held up by a worn, brown leather belt. I held my hand out as he approached to greet him, and as he gripped my hand, I could feel the myriad of calluses covering his palms like armor.

“Good to meet you, Chester,” he rumbled, his voice much deeper than I had thought it'd be. “Your grandfather told me a lot about you. Sorry to hear he's gone. I'm Otto, your neighbor to the East.”

“You knew my grandfather?” I asked dumbly.

“Yea, I'd look after the well for him now and again. Don't look so shocked, most of us older folk here know about it. We got to be pretty good friends a while back, talked about our families and such. I'm gonna miss him quite a lot.”

He looked at me and I almost couldn't meet those sky-blue orbs that penetrated right through any facade of nonchalance I could erect. When I finally did force myself to meet his gaze, I couldn't hold it for longer than a split-second before having to glance back at the endless sea of corn stalks swaying in the morning breeze.

“Something on your mind, Chester?” Otto said in a low, soothing baritone.

I fought the tears, feeling pain creeping up the sides of my face from the strain of forcing my stinging eyes to stay open and dry. There was an awkward silence and the wind became the only sound.

“No, it's nothing, but I appreciate you asking,” I replied in a series of hoarse stutters after a full three seconds had passed.

Otto laid a hand on my shoulder.

“I got a nephew like you, about your age too. He always thinks he has to hide what he's going through, like he's embarrassed about it. Yet, in the end, he always opens up to his family. We always help him through it. So don't feel like you have something to gain by keeping your troubles a secret.”

Maybe it was his kind tone, maybe it was the way he reminded me of Grandpa Silas. Maybe it was the way my head felt like it was going to split in two if I didn't tell someone what was going on. In that moment, I poured out everything to this old man I had only just met. Otto listened too. I told him everything and he let me. The sun was over the horizon by the time I got to the end and finished crying over Daniel's death.

“It took him, Otto. The well. I don't know how to get him back. I don't know how to make it right,” I whispered shakily while wiping the tears from my dirt covered cheeks onto my dirt covered sleeves.

“When my nephew was really young, he convinced his parents to adopt this dog he found off the streets. The dog was fairly small and well behaved, so my sister and her husband agreed to hold onto the dog until the owners arrived. It soon became apparent that the dog was pregnant. So when the time came for the puppies, four were born and my nephew was instantly smitten by them. However, he didn't understand that puppies were fragile. He handled one a little rough and broke the poor things neck.”

The way Otto spoke was hypnotic, the story transfixing me so well that, for a moment, I forgot about my own pains and could only think of the poor dog.

“The dog died immediately, and my nephew was quite distraught. He felt guilty knowing his carelessness had facilitated that tragedy. However, guilt is our mind telling us to act in some way. So I gave him an act to do. I told him that he needed to take care of the other puppies for the rest of their lives. Feed them, walk them, love them. That's how he makes it right. So your brother, you say he has a wife and child? Maybe you can start making it right by helping them.”

I sniffed back tears and, for the first time in weeks, the weight crushing my chest lifted allowing me to breath. For the first time since Danny went down the well, I felt like I had direction. It wasn't strong enough to be called hope, but it was something. I thanked the old man and gave him a hug.

“Don't worry about it, young man. Though, now that you mention it, if I could borrow your tractor, I'll bring it back tomorrow morning.”

I laughed and said “That's no problem. So you used to help my grandfather with the well?”

“Oh yea, I wasn't the only one. There was a whole group of folks that did, at one point. They called themselves the Wishers. Some of the business owners in town are part of them. I don't really know too much about them though, I started helping your grand dad after he stopped allowing them onto his property. I never asked him too many questions about it, but he seemed to have some kind of problem with them.”

“Where are they now?”

“They're mostly business owners in town. The only one I can remember off hand is Amanda, the lady who owns the bar. The ocean-themed one.”

I had no idea what he was talking about, but made a mental note of it for the next time I was out there. He then thanked me for loaning him my tractor and I went inside the farmhouse where I could hear the phone ringing.

I picked it up and was greeted by my mother. She had been calling a lot since Danny went missing. Talking to her was always painful, but the idea of her suffering without my support was even worse.

“I think I have an idea of what happened to Danny!” she shouted into the receiver.

Her tone was that peculiar sound of forced elation that can only be born of the desperation lying just beneath it.

“Oh? What's that mom?”  
“He always loved camping, right? He'd joke about running off to live in the woods all the time. I think he did it, Chester! He could be out there, in the woods, just taking some time for himself... That's what I like to think, that he's out there and happy, just taking some time for himself before coming home. Do you think that could be where he is?”

As she talked, her voice became less excited and more dreamy. That is, until she asked for my participation in the delusion. It was a kind of bargaining we do so often with reality, pleading for tragedy to be replaced by compromise. In my mother's case, she could stomach her son going missing, so long as she didn't have to believe he was dead. She asked me in a pleading voice and I couldn't help but think I would do the same as her if I wasn't cursed with having seen exactly what happened to my only brother.

I blinked the tears out of my eyes and hunched over, keeping myself steady by placing a hand against the wall and fighting to stay strong for my mother.

“Yea, mom. I could definitely see that,” I said calmly while sitting on the floor and wrapping my arms around my knees that were firmly pressed to my chest.

“I had another dream about him last night, you know? I was at the farmhouse, watching you two play around in the corn field. You grandpa Silas was there too, hollering to stay away from the old well. Now grandpa Silas is gone and your brother-”

Her voice cracked for a moment and I realized that my mother, miles away on the other side of the phone, was being strong for me right now. That realization filled me with such shame that I had to bite my lip to avoid whimpering. I tasted blood by the time I recovered.

“It's okay, mom. He could be out there, sitting by a campfire right now, or fishing. It could be a lot of things. I'm sure he'll turn up,” I lied.

“You're right, sweetie. Sorry, I just miss him.”

“I do too, mom.”

That last part was the truth. The fact that we had grown so distant was painful before I had killed him. Knowing that I could never repair that relationship was almost as bad as knowing I had been the one to rob myself of that chance.

After I got off the phone, I crept upstairs and pulled my brother's phone out of my nightstand drawer to look at the lock-screen picture of us as children. It was at that moment that I remembered Otto's advice and texted Sarah. It started with a simple “how're you doing?” and became a solid stream of conversation. We would recount memories that we'd share with one another about Danny, or talking about how Blake was doing or simply offering support.

Blake looked a lot like his dad in the pictures that Sarah would send me. At twelve years old, every picture of him that Sarah sent me could have been a picture of my brother at that age. It hurt a little to look at those pictures, but it was also comforting. Before I knew it, I was asking Sarah about my nephew pretty often.

At first, it was clear that she was a proud parent, but it slowly became apparent that it was more than that. Blake was her last link in this world to Danny. Blake was the only piece of him left in her life now. So it should come as no surprise that she was becoming increasingly worried as Blake became more withdrawn.

“I still don't know what I was thinking, Otto,” I was saying a few days later, sitting on my front porch drinking coffee with my neighbor while he listened to my woes. “I didn't think she'd actually say yes to me.”

“You still haven't told me what you've done,” Otto grumbled, clearly wanting me to stop holding back and get to the point of my story. “You said she was saying she was worried about Blake and thought he needed to get a change of scenery for a little bit.”

“Yea, and I told her she's always welcome to come over here for a visit!”

“That's actually not a bad idea. This could be your best chance to find some closure. Helping your sister-in-law and your nephew to grieve, well, maybe it can help you with your guilt,” Otto said slowly in a voice that you could feel as much as hear.

“What about the well? Isn't it dangerous to have people around it?”

“Didn't your grandfather have you and your brother come to visit all the time as kids? What did he do when you two came over?”

I actually hadn't thought about this before and was stumped. I never saw him go feed the well when we were visiting. I'd of known, I used to get up and help him with the different jobs to do around the farm every morning, back when I used to want to be a farmer and before I was forced into being one by fate and circumstance. God certainly has a sense of irony.

“I have no idea what he did, but you said there was a group of people who used to help him, right? Maybe they would know?”  
“Maybe, but I need to get back to my farm. I'll be back by tomorrow morning to talk if you'd like.”

“Thanks, Otto. I'll talk to you in the morning. You can borrow my tractor if you need to, by the way.”

Otto gave a smirk and a half wave, then walked down the long driveway towards his land. I figured I'd go into town and get a few things if Sarah was coming over. Truthfully, I didn't feel ready to face the woman I had widowed and the child who's father I had murdered. The mere thought of it made me want to vomit, but that didn't matter. They were hurting and I could help them hurt a little less. It wouldn't bring Danny back, but maybe it could help me hurt a little less too.

I went inside to grab my car keys and was about to leave, relishing the feeling of slight optimism stirring inside me, that small sensation that was whispering in the back of my mind... that maybe... just maybe... life could go on.

That's when I heard the well screaming.



After feeding the well, I was on the road, speeding towards town to do some grocery shopping, load up on feed and enjoy access to the internet for a little while. Trees flew past either side of me as I wound my way towards the small patch of civilization nestled into the rolling fields of farmland.

I knew I was approaching the town when I saw the water tower stretching up on the right side of the road, the town name written across it. Just after the water tower is a huge hill, the town just on the other side of it. When you get to the top of the hill, you can see the little town in its entirety. It's actually a really pretty view and I always hesitate for a moment at the top of the hill, taking in the scene before flying down the asphalt ramp in front of me.

Once in town, I ran my errands, only hesitating in front of the liquor store for a moment before driving on and choosing to be sober for Sarah and Blake's visit. I felt rather proud of myself for that. In fact, I felt so proud, that I decided I deserved to have a few drinks before heading home. Sure, I had some groceries in the car, but I had bought a couple bags of ice to toss over them while I took my time. The hard part was finding a bar. I drove around slowly, keeping a wary eye open and finding nothing. I was about to give up when I turned the corner to see a sign that read “The Port Hole” that featured a little tugboat pulling the “e” at the end. I turned in and parked in front of the bar which only had three other cars in the parking lot.

I was walking towards the door while looking up at the sign when I remembered Otto talking about how the only Wisher he could remember was the one that owned a nautical themed bar. What had he said her name was? Amanda.

My hand pushed against worn wood and the door swung open revealing the dark interior inside. I stepped onto the wooden planks of the floor and closed the door behind me, waiting for my eyes to adjust. The life preservers on the walls were the first thing I noticed, along with the anchors and nets and all manner of random things one might associate with a boat. In the center of a the bar was a large ship-wheel, like something out a pirate movie, with the logo of a different beer on each arm of the wheel. The top of the bar was reminiscent of ship railing, and a black haired woman wearing a knee length skirt with a matching red blouse was leaned over it with a cloth to wipe it down. She looked up as I approached, fixing those green eyes onto mine and giving me a smile.

I realized that this must be Amanda, but she looked much younger than I had anticipated. She definitely wasn't that young, but she was no older than forty at the most. I had expected someone my grandfather's age, well into their seventies or eighties. That was the first surprise I received from Amanda.

In those precious few moments I had while walking to the bar, my mind blurred with a series of thoughts. Firstly, Amanda most likely had a falling out with my grandfather, so it would probably be best if I didn't tell her who I was. I could just say that I'm here to move in with my uncle. Wait, who's my uncle? Otto. Otto's my uncle. And I'm just here to get a drink. Should I mention the well? No, not yet. I'll have to do this a few times. Maybe in a week or two of coming up here every other day or so, I'll get close enough to mention it, see how she reacts. I have to get close to her first. Okay, I'll slowly get close to her and then I'll learn her secrets. Wait, I don't have time to-

All that went through my head before I sat down in front of her, deciding that I at least knew to introduce myself as Otto's nephew and could figure out the rest as I went.

“Hi, Chester, nice to finally meet you,” she greeted me in a sultry voice that matched her smirk.

Fuck.

“Good to meet you as well, uh...”

“Mandy. I own the bar here. I heard you had taken over your grandfather's farm,” she said nonchalantly while wiping a glass and not even looking at me.

She came off as smug and arrogant, as if everything I was doing was both mildly amusing and at risk of becoming boring. I immediately didn't like her. I think that fact that I was also immediately attracted to her made it even worse.

“Yea, we thought it best to keep the farm in the family,” I replied with a concerted effort to keep the annoyance I felt from creeping into my voice.

“Of course, that farm has been with your family since... well, I think your grandfather's grandfather, or something like that,” she said while filling up a glass with beer.

“Yea, something like...” I said, involuntarily shuddering at the thought of how long this ravenous pit has been tormenting my family.

She sat the beer in front of me and suddenly, I was trying to repress the urge to look down while also fighting not to be lost in those green gems that almost seemed to glow in the dim light of this shit-hole bar.

“It's on the house,” she said with a wink.

Something told me that while I may not be giving her money for this drink, it was far from free. Still, I was thirsty, and was coming up on the longest I had been sober since my brother's death.

“Thanks,” I muttered and took a drink, trying to pull my mind away from the image of my brother vanishing into the maw of a monster, and instead trying to think of how to broach the subject of the well with her.

“So, you're the new caretaker of the well, huh?”

Or maybe she'd beat me to it, I thought while trying to keep the look of shock from my face. Those eyes had me fixed in place now, Mandy's black hair softly brushing the counter as she leaned in closer to me. I could hear my heart beating in my ears now, but I forced myself to speak.

“Yea, I guess so. It still surprises me that so many people here know about it,” I said, taking another gulp of the beer to calm myself.

“It used to be a lot more than your grandfather who watched over that well...” she said in a cryptic and conspiratorial whisper that was almost... seductive.

“Were you one of the Wishers?” I whispered.

She smiled and leaned in until her otherworldly eyes were all I could see. She smelled like almonds and honey.

“Honey, I was *the* Wisher.”

“What exactly did *the* Wisher do?”

She leaned back sharply, giving me the smallest of reprieves before contorting her face in a pouting expression.

“We helped Silas with the well, and in return, we also got to use it.”

Her tone was vindictively playful. She knew she was giving a starving man breadcrumbs... and not just in terms of information.

“Wait, use it? I thought it just made the corn grow?” I replied evenly as my frustration only continued to eat away at me.

She leaned back in towards me again, locking me into her hypnotic gaze once again. She followed this with a wink and tapped her nose three times.

“It can do a lot more than that, Chester... A lot more...” she whispered, the last part directly into my ear.

I was simultaneously filled with a need to know more and the undeniable sensation that I was nearing an unseen danger. The first feeling won out and I pushed a little further.

“Maybe you can help me. I have some family coming for a visit and I couldn't help but realize my grandfather never fed the well while my brother and I were visiting him. How did he do that?”

I hoped by ignoring that she was flirting with me that she'd stop, but to both my pleasure and my dread, she was undeterred.

“There's ways to keep the well satiated for a while. Of course, everything the well gives must be purchased with flesh. That's why the Wishers came about...” she continued to whisper, forcing me to lean closer to hear her.

I waited for her to say more, but instead, she let the moment draw out with us face to face like that. It was the closest I had been to a woman in a while, and I couldn't help but wonder how it would feel to kiss her.

“Do you think you could teach me more about the well?” I asked, finally matching her tone and playing her game.

Her lips curled into a full grin and she was whispering in my ear again.

“I'd love to, but this isn't a good time. I could always drop by tomorrow morning though, if that's okay.”

“Sounds perfect. I'll see you then,” I whispered back, my heart thumping in my ears.

I finished my drink after that, knocking back the rest in one smooth gulp, and started to head back towards the farm. I was full of the strangest blend of foreboding and anticipation, fearing and yearning to trapped alone with Mandy's surreal gaze.

When I got back home, the sun was setting in the distance, painting the countryside in hues of gold and amber beneath a sky the color of flames. I could see the black silhouette of the well squatting in the field next to the farmhouse, looking like a small temple of dark stones. No, that's not quite it. It looked like a sacrificial altar awaiting the next victim.

The next morning, I woke up to knocking on the door. I wandered down the stairs, pulling on a shirt as I did so. I was expecting Mandy's petite frame standing in the doorway, but when I swung open the door, it was Otto's broad form filling the porch.

“Good morning, Chester! Just wanted to check on you and make sure you're were doing okay,” he said in a voice that one could feel vibrating in their chest.

“I'm doing pretty good, though I'm glad you stopped by. I had a question,” I responded while gesturing for him to come inside.

“If it's about the tractor, I planned to put more gas in it today,” he said while taking a seat at the kitchen table and looking a little sheepish.

“What? Never mind, that's not what this is about. Do you remember you mentioning the Wishers? I found Amanda, she said she's teach me more about the well.”

Otto gave me a serious look.

“Are you sure that's a good idea, Ches? Your grandfather seemed to have had some kind of issue with them.”

“Believe me, I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but this Mandy woman seems to know something. I can't take a chance on Sarah and Blake getting hurt when they come to visit.”

Otto considered this for a moment and then nodded his head in agreement.

“Just be careful, Ches. If anything happens, just know that you can always call on me for help,” Otto rumbled, standing up as he did so.

“Thanks, Otto. I'm glad to have you hear. It means a lot.”

He didn't say a word, just placed a large hand on my shoulder and gave me a knowing smile, then headed out the door.

I wish I could say that I sat down and thought about the risks I had been too stupid to realize that I had been taking, or that I had taken a moment to consider the people I was putting in danger, but I didn't. Instead, I went and shaved and groomed my hair, unable to stop my mind from wandering to Mandy's plump lips and raven hair.

Just as I finished, I heard the sound of tires crunching on the gravel road outside the house and was down the stairs just as the first knock came. I opened the door and grinned like an idiot at the Mandy who was wearing skin tight blue jeans coupled a white dress shirt with the top three buttons left undone.

“Wow, it looks just the same as it did the last time I saw it...” she muttered with a far away look on her face as she scanned every inch of the room she was stepping into.

It took me a moment to realize she was talking about the farm which had the strange quality of being seemingly frozen in time.

“I thought the same thing too when I got here,” I muttered absentmindedly while gesturing for her to follow me inside.

We sat at the kitchen table and once again, I was confronted with the honey and almond smell of her perfume. She smiled and leaned forward across the table, fixing me with that supernatural gaze.

“So, you want to know about the well?” she said with a crooked smile after a moments pause.

“I would *love* to know about the well,” I replied, matching her tone.

“What do you want more than anything in the world, Chester?” she asked excitedly.

You, I thought.

“To have my brother back.” I said. “And call me Ches.”

“The well can do a lot of things... Ches,” she said with a heavy emphasis on my name that made my head spin. “It's just a matter of what you're willing to pay for it. Flesh is its currency, and the bigger the dream, the more flesh to pay.”

“What does this have to do with keeping the well quiet for a week or two?” I asked, confused.

She narrowed her eyes and leaned forward a little more, closing the gap between us and making my mind fog over again.

“The well is meant to grant wishes. If you let someone make a big enough wish, the well will go silent for a while. But it has to be a big wish.”

“Okay, so I throw a few pounds of meat down the well and wish for my brother back. I'll throw a whole cow down there if I have to-”

“That's not how it works, Ches,” she said, placing a finger on my lips to shush me. I wanted to be mad about it so bad, but... I was entranced.

“The well doesn't accept dead flesh for this. It needs to be a live human, the younger, the better.”

My blood ran cold and the spell was broken. I jumped up so fast that I knocked the chair I was sitting in over in the process. The full reality of what she was talking about settled over me, making me feel sick.

“Are you suggesting we kill children?!” I screamed.

Mandy suddenly looked irritated.

“Don't be like your grandfather, Ches! Babies die in nature all the time. Don't you realize you could have anything you like? You could have your brother back, you could be rich, you could be young forever! Think you about it! Every dream you've ever had, they can all come true! What kind of price would you pay to have every dream you ever had be a reality?”

“Babies? Mandy, do you hear yourself?”

“Don't be an idiot, Ches. Your grandfather started off with the occasional prisoner in the town jail, but even if he never admitted it, those prisoners got younger and younger each time...”

“You're lying...” I stuttered, my words falling flat without the force of conviction behind them.

“No, Ches, I'm not,” she growled darkly, standing and beginning the step around the table to close the distance between us.

“I can't believe that grandpa Silas would be okay with such a thing...” I heard myself saying, more a plea to my own ears and than any sort of a rebuttal.

“Chester... you're not thinking about it. You could have *anything* you want. What would you not give to have your brother back?”

She had slipped back into a seductive and sympathetic whisper, and as much as I hate to admit it, the words found their mark. I looked down at the floor, too ashamed to lift my face any higher as I felt Mandy step in even closer, the smell of almonds and honey enveloping me again.

“What would I have to do?” I breathed as I felt her arms slide up and around my neck.

“Only that what you're meant to do,” I heard her say as her face filled my vision, her ghostly green eyes burrowing into me.

“What was I meant to do?” I muttered over the sound of my beating heart.

She leaned in until her lips were brushing my ear and I already knew the words she would utter before they left her mouth.
