1klmvvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gravesdisease/comments/1klmvvk/muscle_weakness/,Muscle Weakness?,"Hey All- has TT 18 months ago, levoxyl is stable, but I've been having hyper symptoms on occasion; the only connection I've made so far is if I drink fully caffeinated coffee or too much decaf, so I avoid that. 

But one of the symptoms I've had periodically that really bothers me is severe muscle fatigue. It feels like my muscles aren't getting enough oxygen, they're weak and shaky. I haven't figured out a pattern to this yet. I lift weights 3x/week and do 20-60 minutes of aerobic activity daily, my bp is on the lower end of normal but still normal. I drink 2.5-3L water/day, eat vegetables, take multivitamins...I'm waiting for an endocrinologist appt, but meantime wanted to ask whether anyone else here has had a similar symptom, and whether you've tied it to something in particular?

1klmvq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXIndia/comments/1klmvq0/asked_a_guy_playing_andrew_tate_shorts_in_public/,Asked a guy playing Andrew Tate shorts in public on full volume if he had headphones.,"And got called a ""fucking bitch"", among other lovely things in Arabic, for my troubles. 

For context, this was in the waiting room at the doctor's. This guy wasn't even a patient but was sat with his friend who had a cast on his leg. They both treated the waiting room as their own living room with used tissues on the coffee table, shoes taken off (he was walking around the surgery in socks and demanding to be seen, although it seemed like there was a backlog of patients that afternoon so none of us were going anywhere). 

As his phone volume got increasingly louder with the misogyntic shorts, I asked him if he had headphones. He pretended to not understand English, so I asked his friend if he did so he could translate. Then he asked me if I was selling some 😂 he then grabbed his stuff and stormed out of the waiting room but not before going on a whole rant in Arabic, interspersed with ""fucking bitch"" thrown my way. I suppose when your English tutor is Andrew Tate that will probably be one of your go-to phrases.

The administrative staff later told me that he's been asked not to come back, so there's the silver lining at least. 

The entitlement is something else. 


Edit: this got removed from a few other subs because I mentioned Arabic (was accused of trying to start Islamophobic/racist shit) and not particularly containing any sort of question. My need for commiseration/attention/venting still has not been fulfilled so posting this here 😂

ASROCK Z390 PHANTOM GAMING 4-CB ATX W/RGB WIFI CROSSFIRE  

I bought the PC through CyberpowerPC so my Bios/UEFI is CyberPowerPC by Asrock. I upgraded the bios to 4.3.

I wanted to upgrade from 4x8GB 2666MHZ to 2x16GB 4000MHZ.

I bought F4-4000C18D-32GTZN, installed on PC in A1/B1, enabled XMP. If I leave all settings set to auto, it will boot with RAM set at 2133MHZ/2666MHZ, If I set it manually to 3000 MHZ, it will continue to boot normally, any setting above 3000MHZ, When I boot, I get a message ""You computer tried to boot multiple times, would you like to enter bios"", if I let it continue to boot, it will be 2133MHZ/2666MHZ.

  
My understanding that if I bought RAM above 2666MHZ then I would need to enable XMP and it would essentially be plug and play.

I believe I have a RAM bottleneck while playing Escape From Tarkov, so that is the reason for upgrading.

I saw that Asrock recommends the RAM be installed in A2/B2, So Im gonna swap that now, but seemed like a longshot to resolve this. 

   
I have been trying to find solutions, but haven't been able too, so any assistance would be appreciated.

I discovered phpBB. Built a hobby community. Watched it grow.

Revenue from Adsense and direct advertisers, I had nothing to complain.

But soon I noticed something strange. Other forum owners were growing faster. Way faster.

They were using vBulletin. More importantly, they were using something called **vBSEO**. It rewrote thread titles, added some SEO magic, and boom - their traffic exploded.

So I switched. The difference was unreal. My forum traffic started doubling every month.

That’s when I got hooked.

**SEO power was REAL.**

Then vBulletin launched a new version 4. It was awful. Developers left and started building xenForo.

Everyone loved it. So I migrated.

And got slapped.

We lost traffic for six straight months. But I stayed patient. We recovered. The forum exploded in size.

Ads paid the bills. Things were stable.

But stable can get boring.

Users wanted more than just discussions. They asked for quizzes, competitions, events. I said yes to everything.

That’s where the nightmare began.

Every feature needed a plugin. Every plugin needed a developer.

Good developers were impossible to find. I spent money. I lost money. I begged agencies to fix bugs. It was a total chaos.

And then one day I asked myself:

**How hard can it be if I just learned to code?**

There was only one problem.

***I absolutely hated programming.***

Still, I picked **WordPress**. It felt beginner-friendly. And Stack Overflow became my therapist. No, ChatGPT didn't exist.

The next six months? Pure pain.

But I kept going. Eventually, I built a working setup. It had all the features we needed. I invited a few users to test it.

They liked it.  
But refused to switch.  
They didn't want to leave the old community just for a few new features.

That’s when it hit me.

**If I really wanted this to work, I had to build my own community platform from scratch. One that replaced everything.**

So I did.

I worked 14 hours a day. For a full year. No team. Just coffee, bugs, and stubbornness.

And finally, it worked.

We migrated. People loved it.

Suddenly, **other community builders were asking about the platform**. They wanted it too.

But it wasn’t built for others. It was built for us.

So I shelved the idea. Took a break. Stepped down from my role.

Then came **COVID**. And a new opportunity.

A startup asked me to build a developer community. We tried Slack, Discord, Discourse... and finally Circle.

Circle looked perfect. Beautiful UI. Great onboarding. Modern everything.

But after a full year, we had zero growth.

Turns out, Google wasn’t even indexing our content. Their JS-heavy frontend made it almost invisible to search engines.

So we switched to Discourse.

Better SEO, but terrible mobile experience. Plugin fatigue came back. Admin panel was a mess.

I was back to square one.

That’s when I snapped.

I decided to build something better. Something that:

* **Doesn’t mess up SEO**
* **Doesn’t rely on plugins**
* **Has everything built-in from day one**

**Discussions. Articles. Polls. Jobs. Quizzes. Events. Webinars. All native.**

I left my job. Rebuilt my old codebase in three months. Launched quietly.

Got my **first paying customer from Reddit**.

No ads. No sales team. Just word of mouth.

Then second - the founder of a **NASDAQ** listed company! - yep, from Reddit!

Growth’s been slow but steady.

And most importantly, **profitable**.

So if you're stuck looking for a startup idea...

**Start with what frustrates you.**

Fix it.  
Test it.  
Sell it.

That’s how real businesses get built.

I had a crush on him in the first semester and the way he was acting was leaving me with mixed emotions. when we'd meet in person he was very attentive and interested but he was showing no initiation. guess he was only seeing me as a friend even though I was feeling like something was there. the second semester starts and we meet again. one day he suggests hanging out together. we go out he ends up holding my hand and well in short before leaving we kiss. after that he like ghosts me for like a week. but we're keep running into each other. 3 days in a row. the last time I'm visibly frustrated going straight to the class he texts me to come out and brings me hot chocolate. that night he texts me if I'm free tomorrow. I also wanted to clear things up. we go out we make up and make out too kinda..... he seemed kinda inexperienced but I thought that was cute. our country is modest and I don't f w fuckboys really. after that he texts me like one time I text him on his birthday and he ghosts me for over a month. I'm moving on at this point. anyways we meet again that day I ignore him he texts me we talk over phone not really fighting but I'm asking him questions and he tries to make excuses whatever. we had an exam the next day and it was late so we planned to talk afterwards. he talked to me about everything. I found out about some really messed up family drama and he even cried. (I know it had nothing to so w the situation but I genuinely felt bad it was THAT messed up) he mentioned how he feels jealous because of my male bsf. which I did notice. his past relationship ended because of that male best friend drama. he explained the situation said that he didn't know I wanted to talk to him after all this I don't remember the details but we made some things clear. he said that we kinda skipped the few steps and he wants to get to know me better. and that he was planning to text me and talk to me. I was very skeptical and demanding and I said I didn't believe half of what he said. I don't trust him and I said I didn't know what to think about all this. he walked me home I joked ""I'll see you after a month"" he grabbed my face and kissed me. after that he texts me like everyday. (about initiation he also told me that in previous relationship he was initiating everything and he thinks it ruined everything so he has trauma response or something) we had an exam together one day also met up had a great time his phone died I brought him in my apartment where me and my roommate (my cousin, 18/f) live. I introduced them to each other she thinks he is a good guy and whetever. after that my roommate was out of town well still is for like 5 days. and I thought I'd bring him and he'd stay here. now that I'm writing this he has been here for 2 days and he left because of the exam. the first day we made out and he came twice but he couldn't please me so he felt insecure and told me that we shouldn't do it again until we're closer. yesterday when we were kissing we ended up in the same situation.

now where the thing starts. he confessed that he watches porn and how it feels ""disappointing"" afterwards. I have heard some things about idk ""porn addiction problems"" but I have never done that so idc. he said that in real life he kinda feels the same way too and the fuck that I seem unfazed and he can't please me the way he wants to isn't helping. then he starts talking about the past and I find out he had kissed like 5 girls and have made out with like 3 of them. I just wasn't expecting this and since he's the first guy I kissed (I was in a relationship once but it ended in a short time) idk I felt so weird. plus he has said all this stuff like how he feels like we had wrong view on sex and it feels like just a hobby for some people (says the porn addict). so I'm kinda sarcastic person all this made me extremely uncomfortable and in a defense mechanism way I started making funny out of place comments that led to... him crying. he dissociated. went completely blank for half an hour or something and it scared me so much. he wouldn't speak and I felt so bad I know I was judgemental and wrong. I tried comforting him them he comforted me saying that it's not my fault. anyways today is the next day and we're completely fine. I made him lunch and coffee before he left for exam. but I feel so uneasy and unsure. plus... he is very sensitive and shows me affection and does this little things, sweet gestures. when I returned from work he was all housewifing he made the bed brought some products but I still feel like... he said he likes me but also says that he wants to know me better first. but after this I don't know if I want this. plus he is this sensitive and vulnerable and I'm pretty much the opposite. I told him yesterday that I think our personalities don't match in that case. but I don't want to blame this on him I think knowing about his past, knowing that I thought all those things were cute thinking he's inexperienced when he isn't. (he's virgin but in my country most people, well, girls, wait for marriage but gen z is takin over. in short I'm saying that things are big deal here) also the fact that he also had like one time thing with someone when he knew me and knowing I was trying to figure out if he liked me too and he was doing all that that made me really sick.
I really don't know what to do. I'm not sure this will go somewhere. what do you think about this situation is their a way to save this relationship or is it better to end it?",1,1747145022.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

This is my first real attempt at making music—and the first piece I’ve been brave enough to share. I’d love to hear what you beautiful people think.

My technical knowledge isn’t that deep yet. I made this track in GarageBand, somewhere between a morning coffee and 4-5 cigarettes. I recently downloaded Bitwig and I’m slowly learning it—just experimenting and creating things for myself and anyone who might enjoy it.

I’m not chasing fame or money—just loving the process and how it makes me feel.

So yeah, just wanted to share a few thoughts and this simple piece of music I made. I’m open to any kind of feedback. Hope you enjoy it.

I've been taking these for like 4 years. Thankfully I've been self employed so I make my own schedule but that is going to change soon because I'm getting a 9-5 job. I've always woke up at like 10am. I think the Clobazam is the worst for drowsiness. I've never taken ambien or any of those sleep drugs but I imagine it's like this. And combined with the other drugs it's bad. I take the Clobazam at night. I'll try and get up at 8am sometimes for an important call on the rare occasion the person can only do the call before 10am or whatever and it's like impossible. And then if I do get up and don't sleep through the call it'll take me at least 1 hour to not look and sound like a zombie. Everyone knows I just woke up.

Also I can't drink caffeine. Every adult I know drinks coffee in the morning and it makes them wake up at whatever time they drink it. Then their body gets used to the caffeine at that time and it's like automatic when they wake up. Unfortunately like many people with epilepsy it makes it worse because it makes the neurons fire too quickly, which is what epilepsy is.

And on top of that I've always been a night owl pre-epilepsy.

But sometimes rarely I'll forgot to take Clobazam at night and it'll be so much easier to get up. Also it'll make my mind so much clearer and able to function well throughout the day. When I'm on Clobazam and the other drugs it's like I'm high or had alcohol. I'm like 3 steps behind everyone else whose neurons are firing quickly. The epilepsy meds slow down the neuron firing like alcohol and other depressants like heroin and we're slower in thinking. Probably drinking caffeine would put me back at normal neuron firing like if I never drank the coffee. As opposed to people who don't take depressant drugs and drink coffee and their neurons are firing much faster than a normal brain. And a brain just on depressants and no caffeine are firing much slower than a normal brain. It's like being a sloth when people who aren't on drugs drinking coffee are like being a cheetah. And if you took depressants and drank coffee or took a stimulant like adderall then your brain would be in the middle of a sloth and cheetah, basically regular.

Sorry for the long post, but trying to consolidate the whole context.

So basically, a few weeks ago I went to a bar and when I entered I noticed a girl looking at me, we held eye contact for a long time, then she broke it and then made eye contact again. This girl was with her friend, which is the one I got interested in.  
Me and my friends went in a bit further and placed ourselves kind of close to them. Then after awhile they left their spot and passed through us, the first girl passed without touching anyone, but the friend made physical contact with me, brushing my entire left side of the body, this was weird when she had all the space in the world to not touch anyone. 

After this night I even talked about this situation with my friend and he said they were looking into our direction several times.

2 days later I go to the mall, and find that same girl working at a store, I roam the store a bit but end up leaving, as I am leaving  the store I say ""good night"" to one of the employees which is there, and then as soon as I turn my head to the counter, the girl was already looking at me and smiling, we held eye contact pretty much until I left her LOS.

A few days later I went back to the store to return an Item, and made my approach to the girl, I asked her about going out for coffee and she replied ""I don't have time, I have 2 jobs"", I was ok, that's fair. And left it at that.

Now, the following week I go to the mall to buy lunch and some other stuff, while I walk to the grocery store, I notice she is working at a booth in the middle of the hallway. Again she was already looking at me, facing me, and then we held eye contact the entire time, then she starts smiling and even says hi (first), very warmly.

I went there 2 more times after that, and she keeps doing this, smile and says hi.

This is just so confusing, as it appears she is giving all the signs of interest.  
I understand she could just be polite, but honestly who would act this warm to someone they kind of rejected? Wouldn't she just want to avoid me trying to reach out again?",2,1747144910.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

But I kept going. Eventually, I built a working setup. It had all the features we needed. I invited a few users to test it.

They liked it.  
But refused to switch.  
They didn't want to leave the old community just for a few new features.

That’s when it hit me.

**If I really wanted this to work, I had to build my own community platform from scratch. One that replaced everything.**

So I did.

I worked 14 hours a day. For a full year. No team. Just coffee, bugs, and stubbornness.

And finally, it worked.

We migrated. People loved it.

Suddenly, **other community builders were asking about the platform**. They wanted it too.

But it wasn’t built for others. It was built for us.

So I shelved the idea. Took a break. Stepped down from my role.

Then came **COVID**. And a new opportunity.

A startup asked me to build a developer community. We tried Slack, Discord, Discourse... and finally Circle.

Circle looked perfect. Beautiful UI. Great onboarding. Modern everything.

But after a full year, we had zero growth.

Turns out, Google wasn’t even indexing our content. Their JS-heavy frontend made it almost invisible to search engines.

So we switched to Discourse.

Better SEO, but terrible mobile experience. Plugin fatigue came back. Admin panel was a mess.

I was back to square one.

That’s when I snapped.

I decided to build something better. Something that:

* **Doesn’t mess up SEO**
* **Doesn’t rely on plugins**
* **Has everything built-in from day one**

**Discussions. Articles. Polls. Jobs. Quizzes. Events. Webinars. All native.**

I left my job. Rebuilt my old codebase in three months. Launched quietly.

Got my **first paying customer from Reddit**.

No ads. No sales team. Just word of mouth.

Then second - the founder of a **NASDAQ** listed company! - yep, from Reddit! 

Growth’s been slow but steady.

And most importantly, **profitable**.

So if you're stuck looking for a startup idea...

**Start with what frustrates you.**

Fix it.  
Test it.  
Sell it.

That’s how real businesses get built.

...and I help businesses build their communities with our platform. I love it. They love it. Their users love it.

Suspected Diabetes as of last week, confirmed diagnosis as of yesterday morning - prescribed a sensor and Metformin. Blood sugar was 300 and 250 across two blood tests (my doctor wanted a repeat test after the first, I'll get into why). A1C was 14.1.

Tests at last year's physical were not indicative of anything diabetes-related.

My doctor (and I) were surprised after regular blood work that my glucose was 300 since in the intervening year between physicals I had been dieting and exercising regular, and even shaken off 25 lbs (215->190), and didn't eat too many sweets, but would have bread or pasta with one of my meals each day.

Overall, physically fit, though diabetes runs hard through my family. Since over the course of a year where I was working to be better nutritionally and physically, doctor told me my pancreas's time might just be running out with how bad my family history is.

I cut out remaining carbohydrates (so at this point, just bread and pasta), I'm shifting exercise to after each of my meals to dampen any blood sugar changes from meals. Also went from three meals a day to two so that I can have an 18 hour fasting period from dinner until lunchtime. 

I made these changes after the first blood test and before diagnosis since I figured my genetics had finally caught up to me.

Anyway, I took Metformin for the first time yesterday after dinner and before running or riding, and I woke up this morning much more easily than in ages! I didn't need my morning coffee (though, I still had it after taking a morning ride because it's routine). 

I thought fatigue was due to stringent dieting and exercise over the past year, but it doesn't seem so. Grateful to be on the path to reversing the damage on my body, and for the extra energy.

As a first little victory, blood glucose has ranged 100 - 200 since I put in a CGM and taken my first does of Metformin after dinner last night!",2,1747144791.0,diabetes_t2,0,1.0,False

**About DataBlur:**
It's a free Chrome extension that lets you blur sensitive information on any webpage before taking screenshots or sharing your screen. Everything happens locally - no cloud storage, no data collection.

**The situation:**
- 100 daily active users
- 1 donation ever
- Zero marketing strategy

I'm not a developer by trade. I just enjoy ""vibe coding"" - creating products that solve real problems with an intuitive feel. But I've hit that classic indie maker wall: I built something people use, but I have no idea how to grow it.

**What I'm calling ""vibe marketing"":**
I want to learn how to create an emotional connection with users, not just promote features. I want people to *feel* something when they discover my product.

**My questions for you:**

1. If you've successfully grown a side project, what distribution channel worked best for you?
2. Any recommended resources for non-marketers trying to learn marketing?
3. How do you balance building vs. promoting when you're a solo creator?

I liked knowing exactly where my favorite grocery store was, who my neighbors were, all the stuff that made life feel stable. But things changed when I decided to move states for a new job opportunity. Honestly, it was terrifying.

I remember the night before the move, my anxiety was off the charts. I kept asking myself, ""What if I hate it there? What if I don't make any new friends?"" It felt like stepping into a complete void of uncertainty. All I could think about was everything I was leaving behind... my family, my favorite coffee shop, even my go-to jogging routes.

The first few weeks in the new place were kinda rough. I definitely had moments of doubt where I asked myself why I ever thought this was a good idea. But slowly, and probably without even realizing it at first, things started to shift. I found a funky little coffee spot around the corner that almost feels like home now. I managed to say 'hi' to a couple of neighbors and even joined a local book club (which is waaay outside my comfort zone but hey, new friends!).

Looking back, while the fear was really real, pushing through it kinda taught me that my comfort zone was more like... a suggestion? Maybe that it doesn't always define what's best for me.

I guess I'm curious if anyone else has had a similar experience of moving away and what helped you adjust? Would love to hear how you navigated the fear of the unknown! 😊",1,1747144524.0,ComfortZoneChronicles,0,1.0,False
1klmjtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1klmjtd/insight_from_dr_ks_recent_video/,Insight from Dr. K-s recent video,"I hope this helps some of y'all. Much love. 

So I have been watching Dr. K-s latest members lecture ""Deep Dive into Fear"" and started meditating after watching. And lo and behold, I had an epiphany.


So I am an aspiring stoic, and 1 linked Dr.K-s thoughts on emotions, fears and trauma, with what he says about karma. Especially mental karma. I realized this has parallels to stoicism's emphasis on virtue


So, as Dr. K says, emotions are all transient. No matter how anxious/afraid/sad/angry we might feel in any given moment, chances are, we won't be feeling the same emotion after a few hours/ days/ months. 


An example that Dr. K always likes to use
is the perfect wedding. Throughout his
experience as a psychiatrist, he has noticed that even people who tried their hardest to have the perfect wedding day, often end up getting divorced. This is because no matter how happy you are on your wedding day
his emotion is fleeting, and eventually fades away. As is the case with all other emotions.
However, how we react to emotions fundamentally shapes what kind of person we become.


For example, getting fired, or dumped, might mean the end of the world for one person while another sees it not as a disaster, but rather as an opportunity. They are able to step back and tell themselves ""there is a reason why this happened. I wasn't meant to be in this company/ with this person, and this opens me up to find the job/ person I am
truly compatible with.""


Even smaller things, like deciding to give into scrolling 5 more minutes, getting annoyed because someone cut us off in traffic, or putting off important homework, sow mental karma. 
In other words, every time we give into our destructive and unproductive emotions, we make it harder to resist them in the future. If we sow negative karma, it comes back and bites us in the ass, whereas sowing positive karma makes it easier to do the right thing next time a similar situation arises.


It's like our vices are serpents, who scare us into giving them food, and every time we do so, they grow in size and become ever scarier.


But the serpents cannot hurt us unless we
allow them to, they cannot scare us into
submission if we are not phased by them.
They will go away., as long as we don't feed them. And if we refuse to feed them a few times in a row, they will eventually starve to death.


This is the case with all emotions. They
will come and go, but how we react to them that shapes who we are.


And this is where the link to stoicism can be made. In stoicism, the ultimate ideal that all humans should strive for is virtue.
they believe that living in accordance with virtue, a.k.a. being a wise, just, balanced and courageous person, will lead to long lasting happiness and fulfilment. It will make our very soul full of joy.


And being a virtuous person is all about
focusing on what we can control.


Going back to the examples i listed above,whether we get fired, broken up with, cutoff in traffic, or get an urge to scroll ourphone isnot under our control. These are all things that life throws at us, just like snakes that sneak up and try to scare us into submission. Allthese events are exactly
that: events. 
They last only for a moment.
And the emotions that they cause are also
transient, as l've discussed above


What IS under our control, and what isn't
transient, but rather follows us for as long as we are alive, is our character, and whether that character is a virtuous one or not is entirely up to us. 
We build this character through our decisions, day in and day out. And the stronger our character is, the more
virtuous it is, and the more positive mental karma we have accumulated, the better our quality of life will be.

If we keep accumulating this positive karma and keep improving our life, we will be better people in all aspects of it, which will inspire others around us, and can build up enough to really make a meaningful impact on them.

These people will therefore also become
more likely to inspire others. This can keep scaling practically indefinitely, leaving echoes of positivity and inspiration that can last even longer that we are alive. This might sound very optimistic, even unrealistic, but if
we really look at the nature of the things I discussed, we will realize that it is possible.

Not easy, but possible, and worth striving for.


As Dr. K said in one of his interviews
on the IcedCoffeeHour podcast, ""Don't
underestimate the power of a single human
being"".

So, the next time your emotions attack you and try to force you to do something you will later regret, remind yourself:

Our emotions are transient. Our reactions to them echo in eternity.

From the start, he checked all the boxes for me—successful, intelligent, driven, quirky—and I’m very attracted to him. I believe the attraction is mutual. Not to sound cocky, but I’ve definitely caught him checking me out multiple times.

That said, he’s extremely busy with work and life, and our communication between dates is pretty minimal—mostly just logistical texts to set up dates. I don’t mind that too much since I’m also busy with work and life too. At first, I was confused by the slow pace, but over time I’ve grown more comfortable with it. I actually appreciate the space and peace.

Still, there have been times when he disappeared for weeks, only to reappear and plan another date. I’m confident he’s not hiding a wife, and he’s always open to meeting and to plan things.

Recently, I found out through an acquaintance that he’d been on Seeking for years. We don’t know if he still active.  I mean I get why he is a SD. Due to his schedule; it is probably difficult to have a relationship (?). But now things start to make sense. He is VERY generous.

Hey Reddit,

Today someone sent me $15 through Buy Me a Coffee for my Chrome extension [DataBlur](https://datablur.app/?source=reddit) with a note saying ""Extremely solid application, has been really helpful in setting up demos.""

Small win, but it got me thinking about the bigger picture.

**About DataBlur:**  
It's a free Chrome extension that lets you blur sensitive information on any webpage before taking screenshots or sharing your screen. Everything happens locally - no cloud storage, no data collection.

**The situation:**

* 100 daily active users
* 1 donation ever
* Zero marketing strategy

I'm not a developer by trade. I just enjoy ""vibe coding"" - creating products that solve real problems with an intuitive feel. But I've hit that classic indie maker wall: I built something people use, but I have no idea how to grow it.

**What I'm calling ""vibe marketing"":**  
I want to learn how to create an emotional connection with users, not just promote features. I want people to *feel* something when they discover my product.

**My questions for you:**

1. If you've successfully grown a side project, what distribution channel worked best for you?
2. Any recommended resources for non-marketers trying to learn marketing?
3. How do you balance building vs. promoting when you're a solo creator?

I'm documenting this journey publicly, so any advice you share might help others in the same boat.

1klmcg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tonsilstones/comments/1klmcg1/cause_of_increase_in_stones/,Cause of increase in stones?,"I have had tonsil stones for as long as I can remember, but they're usually pretty minor and didn't cause any discomfort and minimal smell. However, in the last few months, I have noticed a really bad taste in the back of my mouth/throat and started being able to feel the stones in my tonsils. The other day, I randomly had a stone come up, and this led me to poke around with my fingers and I ended up dislodging 8-10 stones. I have NEVER dislodged this many stones in such a short time span. Judging by the taste that would flood my mouth whenever one came up, they had been there for a while. 

I'm wondering why there might be such an increase in stones? I have a few ideas and wondered if anyone else had experienced anything similar. 

1) I got my first ever full time job in March, which has been a pretty big life change. I'm 23 and had been going to school full time for nearly 4 years. I just started my first full time job as an IT help desk technician, which also involved COMPLETELY changing my sleep schedule. I used to go to bed at like 5am and now that's when I wake up. 

2) I stopped tongue scraping in favor of just brushing my tongue. Tongue scraping adds an extra step to my routine, and in the mornings and right before bed I just want to brush and be done. I have noticed that my tongue seems less clean than normal, so I'm going to go back to scraping regularly, but I wonder if that is contributing to the increase. I brush twice a day and floss midday, but am thinking about adding mouthwash to my routine.

3) I've started drinking a lot of coffee. I probably have 2-3 cups a day. I'm not sure if coffee can contribute to stones, so I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this. 

Other than that, my oral hygiene and diet have stayed the same. I'm not really looking for definitive answers, more just wondering if anyone else has experienced this. ",2,1747143977.0,tonsilstones,0,1.0,False

It was one of those busy Saturday afternoons where everyone and their mother decides *today* is the day to do a full grocery run. I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally *blocks* my path.

She’s probably in her 50s, dressed like she’s heading to a country club.

**Me:** “Um… no, it’s mine. I’ve been using it for like twenty minutes.”

She scowls and gestures at the cart.

**Rude Lady:** “That’s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It’s mine.”

Now, I’m staring at the cart my cart which has *my* purse, *my* reusable bags, and a bunch of groceries. Also, she said she left it by the entrance. I’m in the *middle* of the store, nowhere near the front.

**Me:** “This definitely isn’t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else’s empty coffee cup in it.”

**Rude Lady:** “Well, it’s *my* cart now. You can take another one.”

At this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she’s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.

**Employee:** “Is there a problem here?”

**Rude Lady:** “Yes! She took *my* cart and is refusing to give it back!”

The employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what’s up.

**Employee:** “Ma’am, if she’s been using the cart and her items are in it, it’s not your cart. We can get you another one.”

**Rude Lady:** “I don’t want another one. I want *that* one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.”

Better wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the *wheels.*

Eventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about “the decline of respect in younger generations,” she stomped off… and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about *its* squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.

1klm8kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1klm8kr/can_the_jkcover_jc4r_armrest_cover_truly/,Can the JKCOVER JC-4R Armrest Cover Truly Transform Your Tacoma Experience? Review Inside!,"The **JKCOVER JC-4R Compatible with 2024-2025 Toyota Tacoma (4th Gen Tacoma) Center Console Armrest Cover** has been quite the ride for my vehicle-related adventures. It's not every day you find an accessory that manages to combine style, durability, and function so effortlessly. As someone obsessed with keeping my car’s interior squeaky clean and free from scratches, I decided to give this armrest protector a solid run in my truck. Let me just say—it didn’t disappoint, though it did come with some minor quirks worth noting.

**Design and Material Quality**

From the moment I opened the package, the build quality of this cover stood out. The cover is made of high-quality PU leather, giving it a sleek, polished appearance while also being practical. The reinforced stitching further enhances its durability, feeling like it was made to withstand the wear and tear of a really hectic, coffee-spill-prone road trip. My dog also tried it out with her curious claws, and, thankfully, there wasn’t a single scratch visible. It’s waterproof and resistant to dirt, which is a blessing, especially after a particularly rainy weekend when muddy hands were unavoidable.

**Ease of Installation**

Installing the center console cover doesn’t require you to be any sort of car enthusiast—no tools are needed at all. There’s an elastic band and a safety buckle at the back, which ensures it stays firmly in place. The simplicity of securing it was honestly satisfying, even for someone as impatient as me. I snugly secured it onto my armrest in just about two minutes. No slipping or weird wrinkling occurred after a week of dragging my arm across it either. That buckle is doing its job!

**Benefits**

- Scratch-resistant material that’s ideal for pet owners or anyone prone to accidental damage.  
- Provides full protection from cracks, dirt, and wear, saving you from buying a whole new armrest cover.  
- Waterproof surface ensures any accidental spills—like my morning espresso disaster—can be wiped clean effortlessly.  

[Check JKCOVER JC-4R price on Amazon.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b0dqd3qrhl/)

**Enhanced Comfort and Visual Appeal**

Driving for long hours is tough on all of us, so any additional comfort is welcome. What surprised me was how soft and ergonomic the design felt over long hauls. It cushions your arm but still retains a level of firmness, which is great for support during extended drives. This isn’t just an upgrade in functionality but also aesthetics. Covering my slightly worn-out console, it instantly made the interior of my truck look more classy and put-together.  

**Drawbacks**

- Limited fitment, as it’s tailored only for the 2024-2025 Toyota Tacoma models; older ones are not compatible.  
- It might require slight adjustments during the first few days to find that ‘perfect fit.’  
- Over time, the elastic band could lose its elasticity, leading to a slightly looser fit.  

**Favorable Aspects**

The armrest cover really shines in ways I wasn’t expecting. One of the big wins? It’s crazy easy to maintain. After a camping trip where the console picked up some dirt, I just wiped it clean, and it looked brand new. Its protective nature wasn’t overstated either. I noticed that preventing direct exposure to sunlight reduced wear considerably—my console still looks pretty fresh weeks later.  

**Areas for Improvement**

The lack of compatibility with earlier Toyota Tacoma models is a missed opportunity. For a product made this well, limiting its use to just the most recent generation of trucks feels short-sighted. It’s also worth mentioning that while the cover holds well now, there’s speculation from other reviewers that prolonged use may stretch the elastic band. A more robust fastening method might have helped.

**Alternative Offerings**

Looking at competitors like the EDBETOS Automotive Console Cover or the vehicle-specific designs from FH Group, I realized this product offers more bang for your buck in terms of material quality and durability. The aforementioned brands are good substitutes, but they don't quite replicate the clean stitching or the premium look of the JKCOVER JC-4R. On the other hand, customizable covers are an edge they offer for broader compatibility across car models.

**Cost Efficiency**

Taking its overall craftsmanship, functionality, and longevity into account, the pricing feels justifiable. Other console covers in the market do the same at a similar cost, but they often cut corners in quality or fall short in the installation process. Based on my experience, this one appears to hold up exceptionally well over time, making it a worthwhile investment.

1klm7wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1klm7wc/and_im_the_manipulator/,And I’m the manipulator.,"This is a wake up call for some on here that are calling their ex’s the narcissist or manipulator when they are in fact the ones that are doing the manipulation.

You were the first woman I have had feelings for since my divorce over 3 years ago.  You knew the trauma I went through finding my wife having an affair with our neighbor and what it did to me.  I should have seen the red flag on the first date when you made me prove that I was not the cheater in my marriage. I shared the most intimate parts of myself with you and wanted to share the rest of my life with you. I told you daily how much I loved you and every night while I laid there rubbing your back while you put your cold feet on me. I miss that so fucking much right now. In hindsight I should have seen the red flags from the beginning.

From the beginning: You made me cut off all communication with all my female friends all because you asked if I ever wanted to have sex with them and I said a long time ago with one but that was 15-20 years ago yet you still use it as a reason.  I deleted my Facebook and Instagram account for you and took off any female on my TikTok account yet never good enough.  I let you track me yet you accuse me of putting my phone down so you count see me move throughout my building.

You started messaging guys on Facebook just to get a rise out of me during our first argument yet could not see why it bothered me that you would add random guys on Facebook and told me I need to trust you. You added over 40 guys in 1 weekend and all I asked was transparency while we worked on us. You accused me of breaking your boundaries yet you broke your own rules and boundaries when you wanted and never once respected mine.

You gave us rules like no going out unless we are together or getting drunk u less it’s approved. And all I added for the rules was to not belittle each other since you would call me a manipulator or narcissist every other day it felt like.

You called all my female coworkers whores

You accused me of having an emotion affair with my ex wife just for talking about what shoes our son wants for his birthday. You then accused me of having an emotional affair with 3 different women without a cause.

We would laugh and have fun and smack each other on the ass until I broke up with you and only then you claimed I physically abused you. You were the one who choked me and dug your nails in me yet im the abuser?

Every time I tried to talk about issues I was having you would talk over me, ignore me, or say it didn’t happen.

Don’t think I didn’t notice that every time I told you how you made me feel, from that point forward you would say that’s how I made you feel and then added verbal abuse to my list you want to tell the cops.  I was the one who asked you to stop belittling.

I’m the one who bought or cooked dinner every night. I’m the one who spent my weekends sitting with you at your work to keep you company. I’m the one who dropped coffee and breakfast at your work almost every other day you worked. I’m the one who moved to your house that was twice as far so you would feel comfortable.  I was the one who bought us plane tickets to travel the states and Hamilton tickets because you wanted to see it. Yet you told me I did the bare minimum.  You called me pathetic simply because I asked you to bring some of the cokes that I bought to my house when you were coming over instead of going and getting more cokes. Yet you managed to tell me how sexy you dressed up for me but yet you refused to come over.

Your threats of having me arrested mean nothing to me at this point because I have the evidence that shows who is the true victim. The minute you threw those accusations at me you’re damn right I called the people that hate you the most that know the true you and who tried to warn me about you.  I chose from the beginning not to listen to them and to find out for myself which lesson learned on my part.

What’s sad is I was willing to take all that abuse if it meant still seeing you, holding you, and having you in my life.  I just wanted you to love me the way I loved you but not at the expense of costing me my freedom from false accusations.

YT is prob the most toxic and most manipulative space. its hard to explain. especially in the realms of self improvement and ''do this to become...'' how to be....'' and so on. gurus upon gurus upon gurus telling you useless shit on how to do this or that or whatever. tutorials on basically everything. videos upon videos of ...in theory... ''educational content''

but if you re totally honest with you looking back years and every single ''educational video'' or ''productive'' video you have ever watched: literally nothing changed after you watched it. they all kind of sell the psychological trick where your brain gets tricked into being productive or making progress in something but in reality, you dont make any progress, you dont improve on anything, 99% of the shit people say online you already know anyways and you would be way better just turning off your laptop and driving over to the hardware store to buy some wood and then trying to build a small coffee table without even knowing what you do, and just learn it while doing instead of spending hours on yt watching videos of other people building coffee tables. 

every single video on my YT feed was like: will my life be different in 15 minutes after i watch it? and 99,9% its always a hard NO. it doesnt matter if its sold as educational or productive content...is all just kind of useless BS wasting your time.

if you want to know something about a topic? actually head over to the local library and read a book about it. want to be productive? then go out and actually do something productive. YT isnt any different than any of the other timewasters out there.

1klly3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1klly3d/does_the_oxo_brew_compact_cold_brew_coffee_maker/,Does the OXO Brew Compact Cold Brew Coffee Maker Deliver? Detailed Review,"Testing out the **OXO 11237500 Brew Compact Cold Brew Coffee Maker, Black** has been an unexpectedly refreshing experience for me on multiple levels. I say ""refreshing"" not just because I’m borderline addicted to cold brew, but also because this compact coffee maker brings convenience and quality together in a way I didn’t know I needed. Something about waking up to a fresh batch of low-acid coffee concentrate always puts a spring in my step. However, while testing this device daily, I’ve uncovered some stellar highlights along with a couple quirks worth pointing out.

**Compact Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
Space can be a luxury in kitchens, and the product’s thoughtful design has made a real difference in my limited counter area. Its dimensions—5.2""D x 5.3""W x 8.6""H—are ideal for small kitchens, dorm rooms, or even camping setups, as it doesn’t dominate your countertop. The minimalist all-black finish with stainless steel and borosilicate glass details gives it a sleek, modern appeal without screaming for attention. What I appreciated the most is how easily the brewer and carafe nest together when not in use, saving even more space. Anyone who shares their kitchen with stacks of random gadgets knows the value of clever storage features.

**Rainmaker Showerhead for Even Brewing**  
Getting the water-to-coffee ratio right is usually the tricky part with cold brews, but the Rainmaker perforated top takes out the guesswork. It evenly distributes water over the grounds, making sure every ounce of coffee is steeped for that signature smoothness. It’s almost therapeutic watching the water spread out so uniformly—kind of like a coffee-lover’s ASMR.  

[Find the best price for OXO 11237500 on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07hb3gh6w/)

**Brewing Performance and Flavor Quality**  
This compact cold brew coffee maker is truly a one-solution wonder for cold brew addicts like me. The 24-ounce brewing container delivers an impressive coffee concentrate that stays fresh enough for multiple drinks over a week. I’ve used this concentrate for iced lattes, diluted it for hot coffee, and even experimented by throwing in some mocha syrups. Each time, the flavor was exceptional—low on acidity and high on smoothness. If you’ve ever had that biting aftertaste from store-bought cold brew, this DIY method beats it hands down. One downside? The manual operation does require some patience, as it takes a good 12-24 hours for the coffee to steep fully. However, if you plan ahead, the payoff is worth it.

**Included Components—More Than Just Basic**  
It’s the small details that make this product standout. The reusable ultra-fine stainless steel mesh filter is a blessing—not only is it eco-friendly, but it’s also incredibly effective at keeping grounds out of your coffee. Cleaning it is a breeze, requiring just a quick rinse. The borosilicate glass carafe, paired with a cork stopper and silicone seal, keeps your concentrate fresh for days without letting odors or unwanted tastes creep in. It’s thoughtful touches like these that show the makers really cared about practical usability.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Compact design fits into tiny spaces like refrigerators or camper vans.  
- Rainmaker technology ensures even water distribution for consistent brewing.  
- Produces a low-acid concentrate that stays fresh for up to a week.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Long brewing process can be frustrating if you’re not pre-planning your coffee needs.  
- Borosilicate glass carafe feels slightly fragile; not ideal for those prone to accidental bumps.  

**Competing Brands**  
Several other cold brew makers, like the Takeya Deluxe Cold Brew Coffee Maker or even the Toddy Cold Brew System, compete directly with this model. While Takeya offers a sturdy plastic pitcher and quick brew time, it doesn’t quite rival the taste purity or even water saturation achieved by this OXO coffee maker. Meanwhile, the Toddy maker can produce a slightly larger batch of concentrate, but its bulky storage leaves a lot to be desired for small-space dwellers like myself. What really sets this coffee maker apart for me is its compact form factor combined with stellar brewing quality. If portability combined with elegance matters, this is clearly a better pick.

**True Value**  
One thing I was most skeptical about initially was whether this cold brew maker offered solid value for its price. After weeks of daily use, I can confidently say it does. From the reusable filter to the durability of the carafe, the set feels premium yet uncomplicated. Could you go cheaper with another product? Absolutely, but you'd probably miss out on the finer features like the draining system that starts automatically when the brewer touches the carafe. To me, it feels like a smart investment for cold brew lovers.

1kllvyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1kllvyx/on_adjustable_rate_loansmortgages/,On adjustable rate loans/mortgages,"Atrioc recently criticized adjustable rate loans/mortgages as a tool for banks to profit of the financially illiterate. This doesn't seem that nuanced and might be a uniquely American problem, as I'm from a country (Sweden) where [71% of all mortgages are adjustable rate](https://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/financial-markets/financial-market-statistics/financial-market-statistics/pong/statistical-news/financial-market-statistics-march-2025/).

In an efficient market, fixed rates with a lower risk require a premium to offset the risk. Adjustable rates therefor have an average lower rate which contradicts big A:s take of banks using it as a way to increase their profits. This is the case in Sweden, adjustable rates are cheaper than fixed rates, not the other way around.

I might be overly optimistic about letting monetary policy control peoples wallets but if the point of monetary policy is to cool down or heat up the economy, that doesn't really make sense with fixed rates as the fed simply has less control of households disposable income. (side note, found out that the Swedish fed, Riksbanken, doesn't have a dual mandate but only a single one. The goal of price stability / control inflation)

I'm no expert on American housing but this is my understanding: A high interest from the fed means nothing for people with an existing fixed rate mortgage other than that they can't refinance. Meaning the interest rate needs to be even higher for the people who are affected to compensate. Doesn't this mostly screw over people who aspire to move? Which disproportionally is young people who either move for job opportunities, into their first home, a bigger home bc of kids, or in together / away from their SO. And older people who move as they age into retirement. I.e the weakest socio-economic groups of society. 

Ideally adjustable rates are better for both the borrower who enjoys a lower average rate and the fed which has better tools to control spending.

Maybe this wasn't the most nuanced take to criticize but I feel like Atrioc has a tendency to rationalize examples into structural issues. E.g. adjustable rates are bad because you can scam people, or the argument against gold-investment that's been brought up multiple times that is not that gold wont go up in price, but rather that its an unproductive investment. And no matter if gold 10x:s three times in a row or if fartcoin reaches the moon, I feel like Atrioc tends to avoid seriously engaging and defending/explaining his point and reasoning when he can point at a graph or example which supports his stance, but the underlying theory is a lot more important and ignored imo.   
  
Like, why are adjustable rates a scam in the US but not in Sweden? Or why is gold a good investment, without pointing at the results? I might have just missed those argumentthough, theres a lot of VOD:s and I'm not able to scroll through them all while simultaneously holding glizzies in both my hands.

Anyway, I should've bought coffee calls when the cow himself started streaming seeing as the price correlates 1:1 with his yt views, glizzy glizzy glizzy

From my *“MY Fantasy Life in a Cult”*:

*Many of the friends of the Maracle family came by Sunday to “sanctify” their new home.

*Sorry I couldn’t post yesterday, I was off to register for the summer semester, declare my major (Psychology), and meet with my new mentor!*

Returning to the the Daisaku Ikeda lecture on *The Opening of the Eyes*, today I continue studying the second section, [An Age When Fundamental Ignorance Reigns](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/the-votary-ofthe-lotus-sutra-one-who-practices-the-correct-teaching-with-outstandingperseveranceand-compassion/). 

Nichiren writes:

>When a seriously ill person is given good medicine, he will complain without fail about its bitterness. And we meet with similar complaints about the Lotus Sutra, even in the lifetime of the Buddha. How much more severe is the opposition after his passing, especially in the Middle and Latter Days of the Law and in a far-off country like Japan? 

Simply put, opposition to the propagation of the Lotus Sutra is to be expected. [Just breathe, Julie!](https://youtu.be/ZBohARO6kHQ?si=iIC2I7XY8GnSc-Rr)!

Next, Nichiren states:

>It is now over two hundred years since the Latter Day of the Law began. The Buddha predicted that conditions would be much worse after his passing, and we see the portents of this in the quarrels and wranglings that go on today because unreasonable doctrines are prevalent. And as proof of the fact that we are living in a muddied age, I was not summoned for a doctrinal debate with my opponents, but instead I was sent into exile and my very life imperiled. (WND-1, 241–42)

Let’s bring this down to earth. Our friend Eigenstien in a post yesterday illustrated “I was not summoned for a doctrinal debate with my opponents, but instead I was sent into exile and my very life imperiled.” Nichiren’s opponents did not want to bother with substantive doctrinal debate with him—much easier to dehumanize him, chop off his head, or send the dude into exile.

Just like Eigenstien:

>No, i’m not “dialoguing” with you about your cult literature.

Very courageous of you, Eigenstien! Why even bother when it is so much easier to dismiss, denigrate, and dehumanize. You state:

>I heard from someone else who can still stand to read the dog park’s latest dumps that one of the sock puppets is proposing we “dialogue” with them about the Lotus Sutra. Yet another example of fake teaming and virtue signaling. Why in the world would we bother to do that?

So the RV Park becomes the “dog park” and my posts are just “dumps.” I am wondering whether this dehumanizing spirit I am reading was there all along in you, and because of that, you could never see the beauty of the SGI movement?

Yes, Eigenstien, I must admit again, I am a sock puppet and I provide full disclosure in almost every post by including your phrase for me, “MY Fantasy Life.” I am sure you are equally concerned and disturbed by all of the sock puppets BlancheFromage uses to convey her thoughts.

Next, you tell us: “I couldn’t care less about the Lotus Sutra. I’m busy living my life, and doing just fine without some Japanese priest’s interpretation of a sutra NOT written by the Buddha and having zero relevance to my life from 700 years ago!” 

I am wondering, Eigenstien, whether you gave the same critique to BlancheFromage when she was conveying her deep respect for Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra which she believes is its essence? (For samples see: “The Lotus Sutra says that Kwanyin is most important,"" “The Ikeda cult ‘sanitizing’ that problematic Bodhisattva Quan Yin chapter (25) of the Lotus Sutra,” “Nichiren identified three ‘proofs’ but missed the most important one,” or “SGI member bragging about NOT practicing real Buddhism.”

Next you tell us there is no room for a discussion because:

>We wouldn’t even be reading the actual sutra! I’m sure the sock puppet would be providing Ickeda’s ghostwritten interpretation of it, because they have probably never read a full translation of the entire sutra by an authorized academic authority. (BTW, I have read the entire thing, thanks, over 40 years ago and have no need to read it again. BORING)

All right, Eigenstien, you find the Lotus Sutra “BORING.” So, let’s disappear the scholarship and cultural influences of the Lotus Sutra in [East Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Sutra#In_East_Asian_culture). 

Perhaps, Eigenstien, you are “virtue signaling” your accomplished scholarship and moral superiority which gives you the right to judge who is or is not an “an authorized academic authority.” (I didn’t know that there was an authorization process for research and publishing.) Certainly, Eigenstien, I think you would “de-authorize” [Jacqueline Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Stone) and [Stephen F. Teiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_F._Teiser) who [wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Sutra#Lotus_Sūtra_practice) that ""it is perhaps no exaggeration to say that the Lotus Sūtra has been the most influential Buddhist scripture in East Asia."" Nor would you accept that [Burton Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burton_Watson), one of the modern translators of the Lotus Sutra, is accomplished enough. Instead, you claim authority because you read the Lotus Sutra from end-to-end some 40 years ago. That’s not how academia works. There are endless efforts, reviews ([sample](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23728902?read-now=1&seq=5#page_scan_tab_contents)), followed by discussions until consensus forms.

Eigenstien, you continue: 

>Dialogue? Bitch, please. I’m sure we would be lectured endlessly about wrong thinking and what we should think. Gee, thanks. 

What a gentle soul you are, Eigenstien! I am guessing that the “B” word was directed at me and I apologize if that is wrong. No worries, I have been called worse. 

At any rate, you go on:

>And where, exactly, would we be doing this? On your sub, where you can delete anything you don’t like and I’m banned? Certainly not gonna happen over here! Talk about virtue signaling! How heroic!

We share some things in common. You are banned here, I am banned there. You hear about what we are saying on our side of the hedges, and we read what you are saying. We both post with the knowledge that a small group of people are reading. We are having a [dialog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue)!

I think I am just about at the end. You close by saying, “This is like a fundagelical wanting to dialogue with me about their Bible.” I mean, do you have any “fundagelical” friends? Have you taken the time to sit down over coffee with them? If you have, you would see that digging just a bit beyond the surface reveals some mighty fine people. You should try this! We have and are close friends with several “fundagelicals.” Now two of them, both pastors, serve on the board of our totally imaginary Longhouse Elementary School.

BTW when you write “They just can’t fathom that we have totally moved ON,” who exactly is “they”? Why do I pick up on some denigration in your reducing real people to the pronoun “they.” In the sentence that comes right before you are referring to NS High Priests. Are “they” the “them”? I doubt whether they know or care about you. Is the “them” me, FH007, and other MITA folk? Some SGI members? All SGI members? I am glad that you believe you have “moved ON” although I doubt it very much.

Let me conclude with an observation from Daisaku Ikeda:

>The fact that one is a practitioner of the Lotus Sutra unerringly spreading the Mystic Law stirs fierce resentment in those filled with disbelief toward it. As the Daishonin asserts, “[If devils did not arise], there would be no way of knowing that this is the correct teaching” (WND-1, 501).

Thanks for reaffirming the Lotus Sutra, Eigenstien. Excuse me, I have a lot more to say, but I have to “move ON” with my day!

The article emphasizes proper soil preparation, effective watering techniques like drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting, and addressing common challenges such as pests and heavy rainfall. It also provides a seasonal planting guide for year-round gardening. By adapting to local conditions and selecting appropriate plants, gardeners can thrive in Hawaii’s rich landscapes.

  
Gardening in Hawaii is a delightful endeavor that goes beyond simply planting seeds; it is an intricate dance with nature that requires a deep understanding of the unique environmental factors at play. An essential aspect of this understanding is knowing your gardening zone. This article aims to demystify Hawaii’s gardening zones, explore the state’s diverse climates, and provide practical insights for nurturing a thriving garden in this tropical paradise.

  
Gardening Zones: What You Need to Know

  
Gardening zones, or USDA Plant Hardiness Zones, categorize regions based on their climate and average minimum winter temperatures. In the continental U.S., these zones dictate which plants can thrive in each area. However, Hawaii presents a unique case. Its lush landscapes and varied elevations create a tapestry of microclimates, making it crucial for gardeners to understand the specific conditions of their local environment.

  
Why Gardening Zones Matter

  
Imagine planting a delicate hibiscus in an area prone to frost. The result? A sad, wilted plant! Understanding your gardening zone helps you select the right plants, ensuring they flourish rather than struggle against the elements. For example, if you reside in a coastal area (Zone 10), you can embrace a wealth of tropical plants. In contrast, higher elevations (Zone 12) allow for cooler-climate crops like apples and berries.

  
Hawaii’s Unique Climate

  
Hawaii’s climate is a rich blend of tropical warmth, ocean breezes, and varied elevations. This creates diverse microclimates, each offering unique opportunities for gardeners. Here’s a brief overview of how elevation and rainfall influence gardening in Hawaii:

  
Low Elevation (Sea Level)

  
: Warm and humid, ideal for coconuts, hibiscus, and plumerias.

  
Mid Elevation

  
: Moderate temperatures are perfect for coffee and cacao.

  
High Elevation (Volcanic Slopes)

  
: Cooler temperatures favor berries and stone fruits.

  
Rainfall also varies dramatically across the islands. For instance, Hilo receives over 100 inches of rain annually, while Kona averages only 20 inches. These differences require distinct gardening strategies, from selecting moisture-loving plants in wet regions to drought-resistant varieties in arid areas.

  
Understanding Microclimates

  
Hawaii’s microclimates can change dramatically over short distances. One area may be lush and green, while just a few miles away, the landscape may be dry and sun-soaked. Here’s a quick look at some common microclimates:

**VÆB– RÓA (Iceland)**

i love the vibe these two bring to the function, but the song literally makes non sense. they said it's like a metaphor of life cause no matter what happens, you just have to keep going and keep rowing and this really sounds like when i had to invent meanings that didn't exist in poems during literature tests. i know they will do great things tonight but i also know we'll be disappointed cause they won't make it. anyway, it goes straight to my eurovision favorites playlist. (am i the only one who is developing a crush for halfdan? yes? no?)

**Justyna Steczkowska – GAJA (Poland)**

ok so the song is about a woman who is rejected and after feeling hurt by this rejection she just goes full “I’m a strong and powerful bitch” mode. usually I don’t like songs with this meaning, not cause I do not care about the topic, the opposite actually, but most of the times they are just average songs saying yep, I can do it all on my own I don’t need you and they don’t really give me that empowHERment feeling (right marcella bella?), but in this case idk why it just hits harder. maybe it's the polish? and i love the ""curse"" part (i think she called it like this, the part where she goes zargo, raga, urra..., the part that technically makes you live until 152 years old). love it, justyna is queen, but no eurovision playlist for you girl, at least not now.

**Klemen – How Much Time Do We Have Left (Slovenia)**

okay I DO NOT like love songs in eurovision, so as soon as I read the title I was ugh, not another one. then I read the lyrics. girl, I can’t. I was crying as soon as I read the first four sentences, like literal tears running down my face. now, although this song has nice lyrics when you dive more into them, it has a nice melody, i don't think it will actually make a big impact live, i get the metaphor of him singing upside down but he really looked like he was gonna explode at any moment and the rehearsal clip looks really ""normal"", but i love the fact that he will technically be joined by his wife. unfortunately I think it won’t qualify.

**Tommy Cash – Espresso Macchiato (Estonia)**

this is actually one of the songs i have already listened to, cause i'm italian so... 

there’s a lot to say about what really happened with this song, and quite nothing to say about the song itself. it caused a big collective meltdown in italy, everyone was mad at him, oh he’s mocking italians and blah bla blah, no Gianfranco, he’s not mocking italians and you seriously need to find a better hobby than cry over everything. in my opinion he’s mocking more americans and italian-americans (he's dressed like trump and he does his little dance, moreover he drinks coffee from a paper cup, and i think no italians would ever do that). let me tell you that this guy was able to do something that for me, it’s crazy (it's partyyyy, tatatararatataratatata). basically people in italy follow eurovision, but mostly only during the proper competition and quite never actually stream eurovision songs so much that they end up on the radio, and I’m talking about AFTER eurovision, so you can imagine that before eurovision, only a few people in italy try to listen to any eurovision song. but here comes the crazy part for me, he was able to be streamed on the radio BEFORE eurovision, but most importantly, in the weeks right after sanremo. after sanremo radios in Italy just go for sanremo songs, quite all day, every day on repeat, and tommy cash was able to jump there and say hello motherfackah. about the song itself, i just hope that some coffee company will hire him for a tv ad

**Melody – ESA DIVA (Spain)**

so the song is some kind of biography, it talks about how she has been a diva since she was a child, but this didn’t change her, and that’s what a diva does, not letting fame go through her head. but she also says that divas are not only famous people, but everyone can be a diva: mothers, less known artists…everyone. honestly, when I used to hear the snippets on tiktok and I heard the part una diva es valiente, poderosa, sus jardin lleno de espinas y rosas I was, once again, not another yeah we strong women song. and that’s why you shouldn’t stop at the snippets. somehow is the same meaning as roa, by Vaeb, cause she says all this thing about the garden with thorns and roses, which is life with its obstacles, but you have to keep going cause there are also roses there. I was told by some people that they were kind of done with her singing this song in spain, now I don’t know if it was just their perception or it was real, but I actually like it, I like how the song tells her life from her own pov, it’s catchi. there's a part almost at the end where it just says diva diva diva diva ooooh, this part can be gone in my opinion, she can delete it and the song would be perfect, and i also hope she doesn't do the thing that she did at benidorm with her hair cause idk why, that scared the shit out of me.

**Ziferblat – Bird of Prey (Ukraine)**

let me tell you a little story. a few years ago, a girl from italy was watching eurovision when she suddenly heard carpe diem by joker out and she instantly fell in love to the point where two years later she is crying in her room cause they've just announced new tour dates and italy isn't there. the same exact thing is happening right now with ziferblat. i'm loving this song so much, i love that it mixes funk, 60s music and a bit of rock, i love that it is part in ukranian and part in english. honestly, the meaning is what we can expect from ukraine, it's the story of how ukranian families have been separated by the war, and there is this bird flying between members of the family to share their different emotions. i also love that part almost at the end where, at least at vidbir, the lights went off, i hope they do the same tonight. and speaking of tonight, i saw the rehearsal clip, and i had the same reaction that i know many of you had: WHERE IS MY GRASS CARPET? i had many doubts on their outfits at the beginning but they are growing on me acually. song already added to the eurovision playlist, blasting on repeat in my earphones along with Диско-Фанко Терапія

**KAJ – Bara Bada Bastu (Sweden)**

sausages, fireplace, sauna. let's be honest, more than being extremely catchy and fun, the song doesn't have such a deep meaning. but yes, i've already learnt the dance. i know they are fan favourites, but as they are fan favourites and not jury favourites i know they won't win, mark my words, they'll place 2nd (as baby lasagna and käärijä). 

**NAPA – Deslocado (Portugal)**

deslocado is actually one of the songs i've already listened to. from the snippets on tiktok it sounded just like a basic song, like the other one million you have already listened to, but then someone pointed out the meaning of the song, so my researches started and that's when love came. the song talks about napa's personal experiences of leaving madeira to live on the mainland and as much as they like their new lives, they still think about their origins, they still think about how everything is different and they can't really call this new place home. even the music video made me really emotional, especially cause they used real footage of people who had the same experience and had to leave their home countries for different reasons, and even if they are enjoying their new life, they still miss their real home. i'm quite sad that this song needs a miracle to qualify, especially if the meaning is not fully explained before the performance and because they have been put in a really strong semi and squeezed between sweden, which is first in the odds, and norway, which is another super appreciated song this year. but i'm with you guys.

**Kyle Alessandro – Lighter (Norway)**

if i have to be honest, i like this song, it's way different from what i was expecting, kyle is really good and i'm really sorry for what brought him to write the song (the song is about his mother having cancer, and she told him something around the lines of be happy, don't ever lose your light, so it's not about people asking you for a lighter in the club, or is it Odette?), BUT, and this is my real personal opinion and i know it differs from the average esc viewers one, there is something off with this song, i think it might be his dance break, i don't like it, it really seems too random for me. i usually don't like dance breaks in general it's something that for me takes away part of the message, i mean, you say your mother has cancer and then you dance? maybe i'm missing something, maybe he actually said like oh, yeah, she was sick, but now she's good so i'm dancing in the song cause i'm happy for this? idk, it's just my hypothesis 

**Red Sebastian – Strobe Lights (Belgium)**

i like the mixture of electro-pop and high notes, but that's just it, i don't really like the rest of the song. i'm sorry

**Lucio Corsi – Volevo essere un duro (Italy)**

here he comes, the light of my life, the bane of my existence and the object of all my desires. i like the fact that they are using subtitles for his performance, cause it's one of those songs that might lose all its meaning if you don't understand the lyrics. lucio's song serves as a tribute to those who feel out of place and were never meant to conform to societal expectations. through the lyrics, he delves into the tension between the persona he once aspired to be and his authentic self. he alludes to qualities often linked to conventional masculinity — being tough, unfeeling, and perpetually strong. however he challenges this image by embracing his vulnerability. rather than appearing as an invincible man he expresses his sensitivity, rejecting the narrow definition of what it means to be “a real man.” and you know that he sews all of his clothes? that yellow jacket with big shoulders? he did that. and do you know how those big shoulders don't fall? with packages of crisps (i'm not lying). i know he also explained why he paints his flace white, he says cause when he is in front of the cameras he feels the difference with being in front of an audience, he feels that the emotions are very different, so he wants to kind of protect himself by using this mask. anyway, i love him, i love the song, i love the retro/70s style it has, i love the topic, i love that he brought tommaso with him on stage. i'm actually quite unsure of how the stage will turn out, cause i didn't see much from the reharsal clip and pics, it looked a bit empty.

**Mamagama – Run with U (Azerbaijan)**

this would've been a great song for a club...if it was released in 2014. don't get me wrong, i'm starting to become a little bit old(er) so when i listen to this kind of songs i'm like ah yeah, the good old 10s. and that's why this song won't qualify, i won't rememebr it in a month, but i will spend the next two weeks saying no matter what you do tonight, I wanna run with U I wanna run with U

**Tutta l’Italia – Gabry Ponte (San Marino)**

as many of you know now, gabry ponte is one of the minds behind blue da ba dee, and he is an icon, he collaborated with many different international artists and so on, and he also co-wrote austria 2022 entry for eurovision. Tutta l’Italia was the theme song of this year’s sanremo and many people were joking about the fact that it would have been a better entry for eurovision than any of the songs that were competing, and someone took the joke seriously, cause he was invited to compete in the San Marino song contest and won. He actually looks like a really sweet guy, I remember when he announced that he was gonna try for san marino he posted something like as an artist I’ve had so many first times: international hits, sanremo, my fisrt san siro concert… and I thought I would’ve never had any more first times in this way, but that when I got invited to smsc so I’ve decided to try and go for a new first time and it was so nice. and then I watched as they were announcing that he won the contest and, I mean, everyone knew he was gonna win, but I think he was not actually believing it so much, and he started crying, like literally big drops coming out of his eyes and I was yes, that’s it, I guess I’ll vote for san marino this year, honestly it was so sweet to see. the song is actually what you can expect from gabry ponte, i know for sure that in a month every beach club in italy will play this song all day and all night, even if it doesn't have such a deep meaning, you just want to dance along with it. i like how it merges pop with traditional italian music like tarantella and accordion. BUT i've seen some things i quite don't like from the rehersal clips: the stage looks really empty, he quite disappears behind his console, they are all wearing black, and i think that it doesn't fit with the general context of the song, i would have prefered them to be wearing white and red clothes like in the national final and the mv, i would've loved to have dancers during the perfomance but i get that they have to follow the 6 people rule. i think that the success or unsuccess of this perfomance will depend on two things: the camera works and how the audience will react, if they will sing along or not.

**Shkodra Elektronike – Zjerm (Albania)**

have i already said that I love when artists mix their own language with tradition and modernity? If not, I LOVE IT. i like the contrast between beatrice and kole's voices. i think this song might give albania one of their best results in esc. the meaning of the song is actually quite simple: unity, love, peace and freedom. if insieme: 1992 and novi val had a son, it would be this song. although they live in italy (or maybe it's actually beacuse they live in italya), I think that in this song, and in their music in general, they manage to capture the essence of what they define as post-immigration pop. if i had to give a word to this song, it would be original.

**C’est la vie – Claude (The Netherlands)**

better than i expected, i thoght it was gonna be even more pop. that's truly a new discover for me. the meaning is in some ways similar to kyle's song, cause they both talk about their mothers, but claude is doing so by repeating the words that his mom told him when he moved to the netherlands from DRC and he had to adjust to a new life, that he now adores but sometimes still makes him feel miserable. but i honestly can't understand the reason behind the dance moves when he says la-la-la-la vie, cause the song is sad, but he is like yasss, take it gurl. i think it will be in the live performance too actually, idk. another problem is that if you say c'est la vie, the first person that comes to my mind is actually achille lauro

**Marko Bošnjak – Poison Cake (Croatia)**

differente styles? okay i like it picasso. meaning? i would poison my enemies too girl. sweetness and cuteness? overload, i think i might have diabetes now (or maybe i've been poisoned). overall i have a few things to point out: i've watched the dora performance and the studio version sounds 100 tims better (i can see y'all saying oh really? that's news gnegne) but let me explain, the way he was singing ""made you something that i know you'll like....."" he was doing it with a sweet face, i get it (looks like a cinnamon roll but could kill you), but i would totally have done it with a psychopath face, like honey let this whole psychopathy get out, we get you, we'll have your back (especially with the people who treated you unfairly after dora). another thing to point out in the song is the second verse: i don't like it, it may sound rude but i neither like the words nor the way he sings them. 

**Zoë Më – Voyage (Switzerland)**

these first reactions are getting shorter and shorter, but i'm almost there. so, voyage, romantic, a classical chanson, kind of makes you feel lighter (this is not an intended pun with kyle's song). from what i understood, the song is about the power of unconditional love — how, even when you're hurt, you can choose kindness and stay by the side of someone who's struggling, in the hope that love will help both of you grow, like flowers cared for with tenderness. i really like the climax towards the end of the song, where the instrumental part intensifies, and it finally bursts into a vocal part that feels unexpectedly light and delicate

**Theo Evan – Shh (Cyprus)**

okay, that's a bop. i don't care what other people say. this.needs.to.qualify. period. i've read that it is about the inner struggle of a person torn between fame and their deeper emotions, and explores themes like identity, love, pain, and transformation, all wrapped in a sense of secrecy and vulnerability. but i also read that it is about narcissuss trying to hide his identity when he became a flower? honestly i don't know. another thing that i don't know is why i feel like i'm enjoying this song more than i should, but i don't care, i will still blasting it while i'm at the gym

overall reaction to semifinal 1: i like most of them, but i've already seen a bunch of songs in semifinal 2 that might be a complete noooo for me, so stay tuned for (maybe) another round of first reactions on thursday (not tomorrow, i'll be in grief for portugal tomorrow)",3,1747142358.0,nilpoints,1,1.0,False

It was my first trip to China as a European. I went to Beijing, Pingyao, and Datong (both walled, ancient cities).

1.       Avoid going during or close to national holidays: I had to travel at that time, and it was severely overcrowded everywhere. Overcrowded in a country of 1.4 billion people is different than what you think overcrowded means.

2.       Set up Alipay, WeChat, and Didi beforehand. They are essential.

3.       Holafly e-SIM worked perfectly from the moment I landed. Never connected to any WiFi.

4.       Amaps worked just fine (Android user here). Apple users (like my friend) should be good with Apple Maps.

5.       Didi is amazing. Fast, reliable, and dirt-cheap taxis everywhere.

6.       Booked all hotels and some tour/attraction tickets via Trip.com. Top offers, available in English, and great customer support.

7.       Booked some train tickets via Trip.com and others via 12306.cn. After all, I think I didn’t need to do it via 12306.cn at all. Trip.com was sufficient, but I was worried about ticket availability because I traveled during high season. The trains are amazing. High speed, yes, but also offering food service, having cabinets and clean toilets, water, etc. And train stations were spotless. Remember, they have similar restrictions to airports. Not the 100ml liquid one, but they will throw out flammable products, like hair sprays.

8.       Look carefully at bed mattresses when booking hotels. The Chinese seem to be OK with extremely hard mattresses, and some hotels have them. I had to change hotels because literally the floor was almost as hard as the mattress.

9.       In general, my recommendation would be that when traveling to relatively challenging destinations (due to language, firewalls, etc.), prefer modern accommodation and hotels, rather than traditional accommodations and Airbnbs.

10.  The language is a problem, but not huge. Please be patient with your translator apps and insist. The vast majority of Chinese people were extremely helpful and friendly. I am saying insist, because despite being friendly, they sometimes were a bit staggered, confused, or impatient when going through the translation process. Especially in restaurants, insist on understanding the menu and the items, because otherwise you may eat things you don’t like.

11. The Simatai Great Wall is insane. I chose it over Badaling and Mutianyu because I wanted a less touristy and more authentic experience. A couple of points here, though, to make the most out of your visit:

No. 1: The hike from the bottom of the Great Wall (tower 2) to the top (tower 10) is extremely difficult for an average person. IMO professionals may complete it, but not people of average to good fitness.

And guess what? You don’t have to do this hike. Just take the cable car one-way up to tower 8, hike up to tower 10 (not difficult at all), and then hike all your way down from tower 10 to tower 2, where you can take the hiking path back to the village. I honestly could not believe that people were attempting the hike while we took in the scenery, carefree hiking down the Wall.

No. 2: Gubei Water Town is cute, but artificial and touristy. It is not old; it was built in the 2010s for tourist purposes. I understand why, and good for them and declogging Badaling and Mutianyu, but you won’t see anything of historical value, just a copy of an actual historical city, and lots and lots of tourist shops.

No. 3. : Most tour agencies combine Gubei Water Town with Simatai Great Wall. You start at 9 am and go back to Beijing at 10 pm. To get you to spend money, they try to focus the visit on the town. If you’re not interested in the town, you don’t need such a tour. Take the local bus or find a bus that takes you there. Tens of buses take off from there earlier than 20.00. Just speak to the drivers in the parking lot.

12.  Avoid the Hongqiao market. Or at least go consciously that everything there is fake. I repeat: 99% of the stuff sold there is fake. They may tell you the products are original. They are not. If you want to buy fakes and have fun haggling and interacting with crazy sellers, by all means, do it. It can be entertaining. And some fake stuff may be ok (e.g. a bag or a t-shirt or sth).

13.  In general, if you treat the touristy markets and shops as casinos, you’ll be ok: you know you may lose some money, but it is entertainment. Have fun haggling, laughing, and trying things, but don’t expect to necessarily get a good value for your money or good products. A lady managed to sell me a box with 200 pictures of Mao for 4 euros after haggling over different items for over 20 minutes. 4 euros well spent, but for the entertainment, not the box.

14.  Pingyao ancient city is a mix of history with tourism. Great sites and very scenic to spend a day or two, visit the sites, and walk the wall. But overcrowded with shops, which makes it kind of a historical shopping mall experience. Didn’t regret it, and you get to see authentic Chinese architecture, featured in movies such as “Raise the Red Lanterns”. Get the city pass to enter all sites for 3 days.

15.  Datong was similar, but much, much bigger. It has more than 3 million people, and it was a great vibe overall. Outside of Datong, we visited the Hanging Temple and the Yungang Grottoes. My tip? Avoid the Hanging Temple. Spend a full day at the Yungang Grottoes.

The Hanging Temple was below average, just bad. Ok, it’s a monastery built on a rock, it’s authentic, but you get to see it queuing up with people in tight places, like you’re trying to get into a concert venue. And the views are not that much worth it IMO.

The Yungang Grottoes, on the other hand, were spectacular. The whole site is amazing, huge, with beautiful scenery you can relax and enjoy a lunch or a coffee. And the caves and sculptures themselves, truly impressive.

16.  Avoid the Sanlitun neighborhood, at least during the night. From the moment we stepped outside our taxi, street PR people were inviting us to “ladybars”, which apparently are places where you hang out with sex workers before inviting them to your hotel. Delinquent vibes, and it started feeling unsafe when a guy followed us for more than 40 minutes, talking via walkie-talkie with the other guys, as they are all connected, trying to lure us into their “ladybars”. Disgusting.

17.  The area around the Drum and Bell Towers up to Ghost Street is very vibrant at night. You can find food, nice bars, and above all, local and not touristy.

18.  One does not simply walk into Tiananmen Square. There are multiple security controls to enter, and if you try to enter during the day, you will queue up with thousands of people trying to visit the museums/sights. We visited Mao’s Mausoleum and the National Museum of China. We had to enter 2 hours later due to queuing up, and no, that was not during the holiday season, and not during a weekend. By the way, Mao’s mausoleum will not be impressive to you if you don’t know or are not interested in this historical figure. And yes, you see the man himself. Note that you can’t enter the mausoleum with any bags on you; there is a point opposite the site where you can store your bag. The National Museum is 100% worth visiting, although not the best museum of its caliber I’ve visited. It is huge, so I’d dedicate almost a full day to it.

19.  Plan all sight visits beforehand. I saw quite a few people being turned down in sights and museums for not having tickets. It is a crowded country, remember.

20.  Foodwise, I was mostly disappointed. We ate in lots of places, from fancy to medium restaurants and street food. Usually, we had to avoid half the menu to avoid unusual (for Europeans) items (tripe everywhere, chicken feet, animal heads, brains, balls, tongues). I tried some of them, but I would not try again. Most food was either too intense or too bland. Especially desserts were mostly bland, and my bar is not desserts with 1000 calories in a serving. One highlight was the dough game. The Chinese know their dough: from dumplings and handmade noodles, to pastries, buns, and cakes, I had some of the most pleasing texture-wise dough items I’ve ever had. Dumplings were also usually easy for our untrained tongues, as well as most noodle dishes.

21.  Another highlight was coffee. While it is not too widely available, the few specialty coffee places were stellar. Who would’ve told me that I would have to hunt down good coffee in Luxembourg, Amsterdam, and Dublin, but I could find it in Pingyao and Beijing? Kudos.

22.  This is already too long. But I’d advise anyone to enjoy the overwhelming experience. Let yourself sink into it. It is not a relaxing trip, but a rewarding one. Talk with the few locals who know English, have fun with the rest, haggle with vendors, and try an unusual dish. Queue up and try to digest what it means that the city or province you’re in has a bigger population than the number of people of your nationality globally. Enjoy the advanced technology, the friendliness, the frequent stares, the smells, and the lights.

23. Most importantly, read about the incredible history of China, and don’t skip the last 100 years, to understand what you see around you.

Most of this has been going on for 4 years.  I've been to countless doctors and specialists, including traditional, functional, kinesiology, acupuncture, several OBGYNs, my endocrinologist.  NONE mentioned perimenopause to me.  OBGYNs were the worst, most dismissive, most patronizing of all of them - which makes no sense.  I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars on out of pocket testing and visits and supplements and scans.  I was referred to a ""special"" functional doctor that only deals with complex cases for $10k a year, which I paid, like an idiot, depleting my savings.  I've been diagnosed with all kinds of fringe things like mold toxicity, MCAS, dysautonomia, etc.  None of the treatments worked and my list of symptoms grew.  I've had lots of hormone blood testing done.  My estrogen always looks fabulous, low or low normal progesterone, and bottomed out testosterone.  I was always told this was fine, normal, nothing that can be done, couldn't possibly be the cause of my issues.

My diet is pristine (strict paleo,) I drink tons of water, I am not overweight, I take supplements, I exercise - and each doctor I saw tried to blame all of this on various features of my lifestyle.  Maybe I'm not getting enough sunlight, maybe I need more fiber, maybe I need to sleep more, maybe I need to take 12 different supplements that they can sell me at the front desk, maybe I need to detox, maybe the normal stress of life is just too much for me, maybe I have ""adrenal fatigue,"" maybe I'm mentally ill, maybe I'm just a hypochondriac, etc  - NOT maybe I need some HORMONES!

Once I skipped a period I began reading peri forums and realized that this is almost certainly what's been going on.  The doctor I see next week is enthusiastic about treating peri with HRT and I am feeling optimistic that this might finally bring some relief.  I'd basically resigned myself to the fact that I had some obscure chronic illness and was slowly dying.  This has impacted my relationships, my work, and my quality of life in extreme ways as I know it has many of you.  It is an absolute travesty how women in this stage are treated in this medical system.

1kllnnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kllnnn/i_feel_like_my_bestie_and_i_are_drifting_apart/,I feel like my bestie and I are drifting apart since I began dating my BF,"TLDR: My bestie's and my life changed a lot. She had just met my BF and after that, she didn't show interest neither in hanging out with us nor me unless for short coffee. She confronted me about things that bother her after being quiet and lying for 5 months. After making promise to make it work, nothing really changed and we are drifting apart.

K and I have been friends for 7 years and in last 3 years we bonded to the point I considered her my best friend. She began dating A 4 years ago and back then I lived in another city. At mark of their first year I moved to the same city where K and A live. First two years of me living there were amazing. I grew closer to K and I also became close to A. We would hang out twice a month, maybe more frequently. Me and K were students while A was working full-time. We would go out to drink until late hours as typical people in 20s.

 Last year I decided to try out dating and thus met my boyfriend. Both K and A were very supportive, especially K because she is of opinion everyone should have somebody. She couldn't wait to meet him and had fantasies about four of us hanging out.

Anyway after several months I introduced K and A to my boyfriend. We went out for drinks in the evening, spend couple of hours together to get to know each other. Not until late hours, just had couple of drinks then went home. In my opinion it was good. A and my bf talked a lot. K is a shy person, but she still engaged in conversation. They seemed happy. My bf couldn't stay until very late because he had made plans before we made plans for meeting which was fine with me and he apologized to them as well.

Since the evening turned out well, I was very excited about us hanging out. Now during that time, K graduated and began working full-time while I continued studying in different city 4 hours of driving from where I live. I have classes 2 times a month so it took me a while to balance that, finding a part-time job, meeting my bfs friends and maintaining my friendships. For K it took her a while to get used to different lifestyle and she somehow withdrew herself. Our dynamic began to change. We would meet once a week or in two weeks and those hangouts were always for 1 hour at coffee shop. She was the one who would end them that soon. I found that weird, but I assumed it was because she is tired from working. I tried to get 4 of us together to hang out, but it wasn't happening really. One time K suggested for us to hang out the next day. Luckily I wasn't travelling that weekend so I agreed. I told her to come to my place and I will make us dinner. The next day I texted her to confirm our plans. She didn't respond for several hours. Three hours before dinner, she told me she doesn't feel like it and that we will hang out next time. I have already begun preparing something and it made me angry she cancelled last minute. The next day I called her to check what is going on and asked her if it was about my bf. She claimed no because she doesn't even know him and that she was just too tired and she didn't want to bring that energy.

Several weeks later she invited me to lunch and suggested we go out in the evening to a club. Later I got a message from her she doesn't feel like clubbing and that she wants to go to a fair, but that she will see if she is in mood for clubbing. Since she couldn't make up her mind, I decided not to go. This isn't the first time she has been like that. While that was fine with me before, now I don't like changing plans last minute. Then I initiated another hangout 4 of us. A couldn't come. We agreed to meet up on weekend. After over 1 hour, K left saying she had work to do. I found that bs because she doesn't work that late at night. I got very sick for a month unrelated to that. After that K mentioned she wanted to spend 1on 1 time with me. I made plans for later considering how she behaves. 

Then came that day. We made plans and she said she wants to hang out one on one then next time it will be 4 of us. That day she told me everything. She confessed that she feels neglected and how I prioritize my bf. She claimed she knows how in first relationships partners may start to behave similarly and accused me of that, especially because I don't feel like going out to drink anymore. She said that while she believes me and my bf are good to each other, that she wasn't really happy with our first meetup. She was disappointed we didn't go out to drink for long. I believe it bothers her that he is not a type of person to go out drinking until late hours. I was shocked by that because I have already asked her if she likes him and she never complained. I told her I initiated hangouts at least 5 times in last 4 months, she behaved like that wasn't enough. Then I apologized to her. Then she told me how I left after an hour last time. Then I told her how she always does that to which she responded that she doesn't like spending long time in coffee shops. She then asked me not to tell my boyfriend about this. 

I invited K and A for dinner. It was nice evening and I was happy. Afterwards I asked her how was evening and what she thinks of my boyfriend. She just said that it was nice and that she liked the game we played. After that whenever I had free time, I asked K to hang out 4 of us. However with busy schedules we couldn't work it out. Once more I asked her if she liked my bf and she again said she doesn't know him that well not really saying anything.

A month ago, I realized that the confrontation messed me up. I questioned if anyone who met my bf lied to me about their opinion. But in the end I believe they were honest. I was very open to my bf about how it hurt me what happened with K. Then I couldn't keep quiet and confessed to him . He was understanding and he told that I did everything I could. He was kind of annoyed about how K viewed hanging out.

Now the last time I saw her, she wanted to hang out with me but instead I invited her to join me and my bf for lunch. We had a good time but we didn't really talk since then. Through that time I have been thinking about what I want from our friendship. I stopped initiating hangouts because I am just tired of trying all the time. Ever since I took a mental break from her, I have felt more calm. I didn't feel need to reach out to her. I don't view her as best friend anymore, just someone I used to be close to, but still some sort of friend. Did this friendship come to an end... ",1,1747142138.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Hey culinary enthusiasts! As a chef constantly battling food waste in both professional and home kitchens, I've found vacuum sealers to be game-changers for food preservation. I recently got my hands on the Bonsenkitchen VS3952 Vacuum Sealer, and I'm excited to share my professional assessment with you.

## The Sleek Kitchen Assistant

First impressions matter in the kitchen, and this vacuum sealer doesn't disappoint. With its stainless steel finish and compact design (15.16"" x 5.91"" x 3.23""), it earns its counter space without dominating your kitchen. The controls are intuitive with clearly labeled LED indicators for various functions: Dry, Moist, Seal, Vac/Seal, and Stop. 

What particularly impressed me was the built-in cutter for custom-sizing bags - a simple but incredibly practical feature that eliminates the perpetual hunt for scissors while working with bag rolls.

## Performance Testing

I put this machine through its paces with different food types:

- **Dry goods (coffee beans)**: The 85kPa suction power created a perfect vacuum, maintaining freshness and aroma
- **Moist foods (marinated chicken)**: The dedicated moist setting handled the job admirably, preventing liquid from interfering with the seal
- **External vacuum function**: Works effectively for canisters, adding versatility for items like grains or wine preservation

The seals were consistently solid, and the machine handled continuous operation without issues. While not whisper-quiet, the noise level is reasonable for a vacuum sealer.

## Key Specifications

| Feature | Specification |
|:--------|:--------------|
| Model | VS3952 |
| Material | Stainless Steel (Panel), ABS |
| Dimensions | 15.16"" x 5.91"" x 3.23"" |
| Weight | 3.3 pounds |
| Vacuum Strength | Up to -85kPa |
| Power | 120V AC, 140 Watts |
| Max Bag Width | 11.8 inches |
| Included | Bag Roll (7.8""x78""), 10 Pre-cut Bags, Vacuum Hose, Manual |

## Pros & Cons

### What Shines:
* **Impressive Suction Power**: The 85kPa vacuum strength effectively removes air
* **Versatile Modes**: Dry/Moist settings adapt to different food types
* **User-Friendly Design**: Intuitive controls with clear indicators
* **Built-in Cutter**: Convenience factor is off the charts
* **Complete Starter Kit**: Ready to use out of the box
* **External Vacuum Option**: Expands functionality beyond bags

### Room for Improvement:
* **Lid Closure**: Requires firm pressure on both sides to properly latch
* **Noise Level**: Standard for vacuum sealers, but noticeable
* **Instruction Manual**: Adequate but could be more detailed

## Who Would Benefit?

This vacuum sealer hits the sweet spot for multiple user types:

**For Beginners**: The straightforward controls and included starter kit make this perfect for those new to vacuum sealing.

**For Home Chefs**: If you meal prep, buy in bulk, or practice sous vide cooking, this machine offers the features you need without overwhelming complexity.

**For Value Seekers**: The balance of functionality, durability, and price point makes this an excellent choice for those wanting to reduce food waste without breaking the bank.

## Professional Chef's Verdict

As someone who values both functionality and efficiency in the kitchen, I find the Bonsenkitchen VS3952 to be a valuable addition to any home kitchen. It extends food freshness up to 6x longer than conventional storage methods, preserves flavor, prevents freezer burn, and ultimately reduces waste.

The stainless steel design, versatile functionality, and thoughtful features like the built-in cutter demonstrate that Bonsenkitchen understands what home cooks actually need from a vacuum sealer.

I was not even allowed to participate in integration language class since I have studied at uni. The mentor just repeated that even Finnish cannot find jobs, so just wait. The TE office reforms sth, not sure what it is. I'm arranged with an old arrogant lady in Jan, 2025. She never replies my message, both email and from TE website. I got her email only after I have been waiting too long and lost temper in my message. And the replies are always negative. I cannot attend any integration program, and lesson, and even any work trail. I cannot even go to CV polishing class since they have limited positions.

There is a organization called settlementti which helps foreigners to get jobs. I finnally got help from them and allowed to start a work trail at supermarket, even I have 2 master degrees, and honestly to say, really good work experience in famous international companies. I accepted because I dont speak good Finnish yet, it might just be a start. I worked at market 6 hours a day, 5 days per week without salary. I only applied Kela subsidy after I began to work. I think I have contributed now. I was not informed any rights for this work trail. I dont have coffee break and annual leave. I feel like a slave, but I accept it. It's just a start. The 1st work trail is supposed to be 2 months. Then after I worked a month, I got a new one at another supermarket, which is promised to become an official work after 2 months' trail at that one. I think the two trials are almost the same, so I planned to stop the current one and have some time to continue apply to work in my field and study Finnish at home. So I asked TE office I want to interupt the current one. I waited so long for the reply that I have made my schedule. The TE officer lady finally messaged me and criticized that""You have been unemployed for so long. Why you think you can get holiday after working for just a month? Your subsidiary will be stoppped. Go talk to your employer if  he can agree.""

I feel so sad today. I worked in my country in the top American FANG companies. Why I'm so looked down here even with local degree. I worked hard without payment to earn local exprerience. Why I cannot stop such unpaid job according to my willings. I dont hate Finland because I accept kindness here and my husband really enjoys to work here. But I really feel helpless and sad.

I’m not here to pretend I was the victim of a misunderstanding or that I was “doing my best.”
I wasn’t. I was avoidant, dishonest, emotionally unreliable, financially chaotic, spiritually confused, and somehow still managing to say “you’re overreacting” while being completely unavailable.

So this isn’t a flex.
It’s a confession.
And a prayer that self-awareness counts for something, even if it shows up late and smelling like vape juice and broken promises.

Here are 20 things I would gladly do if she ever decided to let me move back in and try again:

⸻

	1.	Delete OnlyFans. Not just the app. The memory. The era. The whole embarrassing genre of “intellectual curiosity.”
	2.	Let her read my phone like it’s court-ordered. Scroll away, Your Honor.
	3.	Actually shut down my failing business. No “this next job will turn it around.” I’ve said that eight times. It didn’t.
	4.	Apologize for missing the newborn stage. I was “busy.” I was “tired.” I was selfish.
	5.	Create a chore wheel where every slot just says “Me.”
	6.	Attend parenting classes and be the guy who actually takes notes.
	7.	Stop giving TED talks about my spiritual growth while ignoring text messages about the baby’s nap schedule.
	8.	Read every message I avoided and respond with what I should have said. Then light my ego on fire and roast marshmallows over it.
	9.	Respect boundaries like they’re sacred, not suggestions.
	10.	Call her mother. Just to talk. About her plants. Without sarcasm.
	11.	Do all the nighttime wake-ups for six months. No complaints. I owe at least that much to karma and colic.
	12.	Build her a snack drawer. Stocked. Off-limits. Not a single Cheez-It stolen.
	13.	Stop whispering “technically” after saying, “You were right.”
	14.	Make coffee how she likes it. Memorize it. Tattoo it if necessary.
	15.	Say thank you daily — not for the big stuff, but for the stuff I used to take for granted.
	16.	Turn the retreat center (a.k.a. my mom’s guest room) back into just my mom’s guest room.
	17.	Stop trying to “win” the relationship and just show up for it.
	18.	Stop staying in touch with people I promised not to. It wasn’t harmless. It was cowardly.
	19.	Carry emotional labor like it’s CrossFit. Show up sweaty and consistent.
	20.	Stop trying to fix things with poetry when what’s needed is reliability.

I recently picked up some BPC-157 capsules for my tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) from an online source I’m not familiar with. It was the only place I could find selling it in oral capsule form in canada so I went for it but I’m a bit skeptical about the quality.

It’s only been about a week since I started taking them, so I’m not expecting to feel much yet. However, I’ve noticed something odd. the capsules dissolve really fast. Like I’ll pop one in my mouth, take a sip of water and within 2–3 seconds it’s basically gone. fully dissolved.

At first, I didn’t think much of it because I’d usually take it quickly. But one morning I took a sip of hot coffee and couldn’t swallow fast enough, and the capsule completely dissolved in my mouth. Tried it again with cold water and got the same result. super fast breakdown.

Could this be a red flag that it’s a fake or low quality product? Has anyone else experienced this?

The MAMAZING S66 Lightweight Baby Travel Stroller immediately caught my attention with its sleek design and portability. Weighing just 11.6 pounds, thanks to its carbon fiber frame, this stroller effortlessly combines durability and ease of use. Carrying it felt like a breeze compared to other clunky travel strollers I’ve tried. The compact structure folds down to a neat size (H20.6 x W18.5 x D11 inches), perfect for fitting into my car trunk or even overhead bins when flying. Navigating crowded airports or bustling streets with this was a surprisingly stress-free experience.  

**User-Friendly Folding Mechanism**  
A standout feature for me has to be the one-handed fold-and-unfold system. On a chaotic morning when my toddler was in full meltdown mode, I managed to collapse the stroller and load it into the car with just one hand while holding a coffee in the other. It literally takes seconds, which made all the difference in such situations. I’ve tested other strollers that put me through countless attempts at figuring out their folding systems, so this ease of operation felt like a godsend.

[Check MAMAZING S66 price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0cx999ymh/)  

**Comfort for Little Ones**  
What sealed the deal for my kids was the level of comfort offered by this stroller. The seat, made from a blend of polyester, faux leather, and cotton, has a plush feel, giving my child total relaxation. The adjustable UPF 50+ canopy became our lifesaver on sunny days, providing much-needed shade without trapping heat underneath. My toddler, who usually fusses in strollers, actually enjoyed sitting in this one for prolonged durations—probably the best indicator of its quality!  

**Safety Features to Keep Your Mind at Ease**  
When it came to safety, the inclusion of a robust 5-point harness system reassured me that my child stayed securely strapped even during bumpy rides. It also has a foot-operated brake system that’s responsive and reliable on varied surfaces. This stroller meets both CPSC and ASTM standards, providing an added level of trustworthiness, especially for parents like me who prioritize child safety above all else.  

**Storage Options That Don’t Disappoint**  
As a mom always lugging around bags of snacks, toys, and wipes, I appreciated the spacious under-seat basket. Though it can handle a maximum weight of 4.4 pounds, I managed to squeeze in a diaper bag and a few extras during one of our zoo visits. While it’s not spacious enough for heavy-duty shopping trips, it’s more than enough for daily essentials.  

**Positives**  
- Lightweight and highly portable at 11.6 pounds.  
- Compact folding design for easy storage or travel.  
- Comfortable seat with quality material.  
- Reliable safety features like the 5-point harness and foot brake.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The under-seat basket has a low weight limit of 4.4 pounds.  
- Not compatible with car seats, which could limit its utility for some parents.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
While testing this stroller, I also had the chance to look into a few competing options like the Summer 3Dlite Convenience Stroller and the GB Pockit+ All-City Stroller. The Summer 3Dlite is lighter on the wallet and comes with a similar lightweight design, but it lacks the advanced carbon fiber frame that makes the MAMAZING S66 feel so durable. On the other hand, the GB Pockit+ offers incredible portability with a smaller folded size; however, its canopy isn’t as UV-resistant as the one on this stroller. The MAMAZING S66 hits the perfect middle ground in terms of quality build, comfort, and features while staying suitably compact for travel.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Given its combination of durability, comfort, and ease of use, this stroller feels like a worthwhile investment for parents always on the move. While it might not be the cheapest option out there, the advanced materials and smart design pay off in convenience and peace of mind. In a world where lightweight strollers often compromise on sturdiness, the MAMAZING S66 strikes an excellent balance.

..........

He led me gently to a chair, and I sat. My body aching, sore in the most intimate of ways, but my heart oddly light. On the table in front of me were takeout containers, still warm. He opened each one, placing them carefully between us, asking softly, ""What do you want?""

God. That small act—it shattered me in a beautiful way.

This quiet tenderness, this slice of normalcy after the storm of our bodies, it felt too perfect, too whole. My chest swelled, warm and full, as if this moment could stitch me back together. I told him I was too tired to move, and he smiled, feeding me instead. A bite for me. A bite for him. A sip for me. A sip for him. He fed me like I was precious, like I was cherished. We talked about the mundane, about life, about everything and nothing. I wanted to live in that moment forever. I wanted time to stop right there, with his hand brushing crumbs from my lips.

But then, he said her name.

""Samantha.""

It rang in my ears like a siren, shrill and dissonant. It was like a glass of ice water thrown over my bare skin, shocking, cruel. It seeped into the cracks of my mind like poison, freezing everything soft inside me. I froze, smiling—out of habit, out of fear, out of self-preservation.

“Samantha?” I asked, my voice too sweet to match the sudden storm in my chest.

He continued, explaining his recent encounters with her—casually, like it meant nothing. Like it was just another anecdote. I nodded. I smiled. I pretended. But I wasn’t listening. My thoughts were loud, louder than his voice. I thought she was gone. I thought I was enough. Was I ever enough? That name echoed in my skull, a painful reminder I wasn’t the only one. I tried not to cry. I tried not to break.

I kept smiling, swallowing the pain down like bitter wine.

I shouldn’t compare—I know that.

But he was mine first.

And yet, if he truly felt whole with me, would there even be room for her?

If I were enough, he wouldn’t be seeing her. And yet here I was, fed by him, loved by him, fucked so thoroughly I could barely move—and still feeling like second best.

This pain didn’t just sit on the surface; it burrowed deep, somewhere between my ribs, sinking into my bones. It pulsed with every beat of my heart, each one whispering the same cruel thing: *You’re not enough.*  
Not soft enough. Not strong enough. Not *her*.

And yet, I couldn’t bring myself to blame him. Not really.  
I had walked willingly into this. I knew how it would end, knew the hollow echo it would leave. I chose this kind of love—the kind where I would always hunger for more than I was allowed to have, always wanting something that could never be mine.

Was this love? Or was this just the cruel illusion of it?  
Fuck.

Later, we moved to the bed, our bodies curling into each other like instinct. His skin was warm against mine, his breathing steady. He held me, but the space between us felt louder than it ever had before. That name still echoed in the back of my mind—like a whisper I couldn’t shake. I pulled myself closer, pressing my lips to his ear. “You’re mine, right?” I asked, almost too softly. A desperate prayer in the shape of a question.

“Yes,” he replied, without hesitation. “Just like you’re mine.”

Lies.

Beautiful, cruel lies.

I kissed his lips—a soft, fleeting peck that carried the weight of everything I couldn’t say—and then buried my face in the curve of his neck, breathing him in, trying to memorize the scent of someone who might not be mine tomorrow. I held him tighter, as if my arms could anchor him to me. As if holding him close could stop the inevitable. But deep down, I knew—I was clinging to something that was never really mine to keep. So why did it feel like I was losing everything?

In the car, on the way to my drop-off, our hands were intertwined, but mine were trembling. I kept stealing glances at him as he drove, studying the curve of his jaw, the way the light played against his skin, the quiet concentration in his eyes. I was memorizing him like a favorite song you know will fade soon, storing him in a place where memory tries to fight time. The closer we got to goodbye, the more I felt my chest tighten, like time was rushing me toward a cliff I wasn’t ready to fall from. I held his hand tighter, but it was like trying to hold onto smoke—slipping through despite my desperation. Was he slowly slipping away? Or was I finally beginning to loosen my grip, quietly breaking inside, but trying to find the strength to let go?

When we arrived, everything inside me screamed to stay. To rewind. To pause. But reality doesn’t grant that mercy. For the last time, I hugged him tightly. Like maybe, just maybe, this embrace could stitch something permanent into our story. I kissed him hard, hoping he’d taste the goodbye I couldn’t voice. I pressed my face to him, took a deep breath, trying to memorize the warmth that once felt like home. Then, with trembling hands and a smile that barely held, I waved as he drove away. .Each second as the car disappeared felt like something sacred unraveling. I stood for a moment, the ghost of his touch still lingering on my skin. And then I turned, forcing myself to walk away, not daring to look back—because I knew if I did, I might never be able to let go.

Tomorrow, I will wake up with the hollow ache of knowing I left—silently, without a word—while he slept unaware, never knowing I was already saying goodbye.",5,1747141424.0,AlasFeels,3,1.0,False

As a lifelong baseball fan, I often browse looking for nostalgic treasures. That day, I stumbled upon an incredible listing: a vintage 1950s Rawlings baseball glove that looked like it had just come out of a time capsule. It was the type of glove that legends wore, complete with the signature of a Hall of Famer embossed on the thumb. I had to have it.

The bidding was set to start at a mere $50, and I thought, ‘This can’t be right!’ I quickly registered my bid, envisioning myself using it for casual catch sessions with my friends. I imagined the stories we’d create, trading tales of the greats while breaking in this stunning piece of history. But as the auction progressed, I watched the price climb steadily and nervously. At one point, I was up against a couple of serious collectors who clearly knew their stuff. It was exhilarating and nerve-wracking at the same time.

The final minutes of the auction were a whirlwind. I remember my heart racing as I placed my final bid of $250, gripping my coffee cup tightly as I awaited the end of the countdown. I could see the other bidders' names flickering in and out of the leaderboard, and it felt like a mini World Series game—full of suspense and unpredictability.

Finally, the auction concluded and I couldn’t believe it—my bid had won! I was ecstatic, practically bouncing in my seat. When the glove arrived a few days later, it exceeded my expectations. The leather was aged beautifully, and the smell of it brought me back to my childhood days of playing catch in the backyard. I spent the weekend breaking it in, feeling like a kid again.

That glove has become more than just a collectible; it’s a centerpiece in my living room. Friends love to ask about it, sparking conversations about baseball history and letting me share the thrill of that auction experience. It’s incredible what you can find if you dig deep enough.

Wishing you peace and progress today :)

# Today's check in:

What is something you can do to be kind to yourself today?

# Bonus exercise: Time in and Time Out

For many of us (me included!), binging and other unhelpful behaviours are used as relief from negative emotions. To move ourselves from ""I'm not binging but it's all I can think about"" to ""I'm not binging and I don't miss it either"", we need to find other ways to deal with those emotions.

There are two ways to deal with emotions: emotional regulation (""Time In"") and emotional discharge (""Time Out"").

\*\***The more you invest in Time In, the less often you're going to need those Time Outs.** Like everything, the more you maintain your emotional needs, the less often they’re going to need emergency care!!\*\*

**Time In is the things that we do** ***before*** **our emotions become overwhelming.** It's emotional maintenance. Time In includes things like:

* meditation (CoSaWe04)
* journaling
* listening to music
* reading (CoSaWe04)
* walking / yoga / swimming / running / other exercise (zodiahck, HappyVanillaBean, CoSaWe04, Future-Designer-6855, Anybody\_Minimum)
* maintaining friendships and spending time with loved ones (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Future-Designer-6855)
* eating delicious and nutritious food to sustain ourselves on a regular basis (not over-restricting!), and staying hydrated (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Future-Designer-6855)
* checking in with ourselves and paying attention to our feelings and needs
* coffee dates with ourselves (Anybody\_Minimum)
* checking in on loved ones / favourite people (zodiahck, Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* phone-free playtime with kids (MSH0123)
* listening to recovery podcasts (smokyoat)
* making sure to get enough sleep (guavatc, HappyVanillaBean)
* taking breaks from work or studies (guavatc)
* Colouring, Cross-stitching, General crafting (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* extended skincare routine, with scented candles and soft music (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* Listening to audiobooks (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* Reading something comforting, usually something I’ve read 100 times before! (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* Planning engaging activities or routines (HappyVanillaBean)
* Arts and crafts (CoSaWe04, Anybody\_Minimum)
* oils on the pillow at night (Future-Designer-6855)
* food journaling (Future-Designer-6855)

**Time Out is the things we do when our emotions are high and we need to discharge them.** It's emotional 911. For most emotions, it usually takes about 20 minutes for discharge to occur (of course there will be exceptions, for example if someone you love has passed away you're not going to discharge those emotions in 20 minutes). Binging is a form of Time Out, a very effective one but also one that creates its own problems... More helpful types of Time Out include things like:

* more intense exercise (CoSaWe04)
* dancing
* crying
* venting (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Anybody\_Minimum)
* writing can also be a discharge activity
* screaming into a pillow
* taking a car ride with the windows down (MSH0123)
* driving or walking somewhere nice (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean)
* hot shower or bath (MSH0123, smokyoat, HappyVanillaBean, CoSaWe04, Anybody\_Minimum)
* DIY/hammering things! (apragopolis)
* vent art / memes (guavatc, Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* listening to angsty music (guavatc)
* a hot cup of tea (guavatc)
* watching comforting or funny youtube videos (guavatc, CoSaWe04)
* stomping around (apragopolis)
* watching something sad and having a good cry (smokyoat)
* therapy (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* getting into bed, sleeping or napping (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty, HappyVanillaBean, Anybody\_Minimum)
* aggressive cleaning, vacuuming, scrubbing (Bad\_Mr\_Kitty)
* grabbing a refreshing drink (HappyVAnillaBean)
* reading (CoSaWe04)
* heated blanket (CoSaWe04)
* weighted blanket and essential oils (Anybody\_Minimum)
* fidget toys (Future-Designer-6855)
* look at pictures of loved ones (Future-Designer-6855)
* leave the situation (Future-Designer-6855)
* check in with a support group (Future-Designer-6855)
* duvet day (Anybody\_Minimum)

**So the exercise is:** What does your Time In and Time Out look like? Are there any that you are you willing to try (I'll add yours to the lists above!), and are there opportunities for more investment in Time In?

1kll0mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/elgwynrielucien/comments/1kll0mt/why_elriel_isnt_a_slow_burn_its_a_dead_end/,Why Elriel Isn’t a Slow Burn - It’s a Dead End,"Let’s stop pretending Elriel is a slow burn. It’s not. It’s a stalled flame that went out the moment they chose silence over action. Here’s why it doesn’t work - emotionally, narratively, or romantically.

Buckle up - this is a long read and analysis. Don't like? Don't read. Yes I am repetitive a little - to drive points home and support new ones.

\---

There’s just too much fallout, politics, and potential damage tied up in Elriel. And honestly? Not nearly enough reward to make any of it actually worth it.

Autumn Court tensions. Possibly Day Court politics. Potential fractures within the IC itself. Lucien or Azriel actually being killed in a blood duel.

Bonds are supposed to be sacred. Rare, even. (Though, from where we’re standing, they seem to pop up pretty frequently, don’t they? Ha.)

And if Azriel’s mate does show up….which, let’s be real, is probably likely given he's an important character….do we really think he’s going to ignore that? After wanting a mate for so long? That would just mean even more heartbreak for Elain. If anyone seriously believes Az would abandon his mate once that bond snaps…..ooof.

Elriel holds no foundation. They talked about gardening. Twice. And that was back when she was still hung up on Grayson and he was still stuck on Mor.

Where are the actual moments of connection? Where’s the healing? Vulnerability? The conversations that show they’re not just good for each other in theory, but in practice? What Azriel feels around her so far is mostly self-loathing. Maybe a few smiles. (And of course I'm sure Mor made him smile and laugh over the course of 5 centuries)

We should ask….why did he fall for Mor? Because she was kind to him, maybe the first non familial female to do so. She made him feel included. Wanted (in friendship, though he tried for more). Seen. He was vulnerable with her. Maybe for the first time in his life.

There’s been zero vulnerability between Azriel and Elain. No deep conversations. No emotional groundwork. Sure, they have a quantity of small moments. Glances. Some chemistry. But there’s no quality. No weight. They don’t talk about anything that actually matters. And it’s been nearly two years.

And the silence between them?

That’s not a romantic slow burn.

It’s a no burn.

It’s hollow. 

It’s two people who want to feel something…..but not enough to risk the discomfort of actual honesty and something real. Neither of them has tried to break through. Not once.

Real connection? It takes risk. It takes effort. And they’ve both chosen something else.

\---

Frankly, their entire dynamic reads like a rebound.

Elain, reeling and heartbroken from Grayson’s rejection. Azriel, emotionally stranded after centuries of pining for Mor. They were both hurting, both craving to feel wanted, to feel something else, and they latched onto the nearest safe place for some level of *comfort*. Because it’s easier to feel something safe and shallow than to face the terrifying depths of real healing. Comfort is easy. It asks nothing of you. Growth demands everything.

And they haven’t chosen growth. Not with each other.

\---

Honestly, we already saw Elain reject the beginning of their connection once....if we can even call a kiss a true 'connection'. (People have hookups and kisses all the time that arent deeper than that.)

Right after Azriel leaned in….he told her it was a mistake. \*Forced\* or not. \*He\* chose those words. Not ""I'll talk to you later"". ""Wait right here."" The guy went with - ""This was a mistake.""

That line? That shattered whatever illusion they were both holding onto.

It confirmed Elain’s worst fear: that she was once again…..unwanted. Another almost. Another not-quite. Another rejection, and so soon after Grayson. Imagine how she felt in that moment.

So what did she do? She beat him to it.

She returned the necklace. No note. No explanation. She could have fought for him, she is an equal part in this…but she didn’t.

It wasn’t just the gift she was returning...it was everything it represented. The gesture, the tension, the possibility. She closed that door before it even had the ability to open further. And rightfully so. She is protecting herself after such a heartbreaking comment.

Azriel gave her an out with that line. And she took it.

Not with confrontation.

But with silence. Because that’s what they do. They don't have any more depth. And sometimes silence says more than words ever could.

It was easier to close the box than to open a real conversation...And then that sat...for months. By BOTH of them.

\---

We also have to talk about Azriel’s thoughts in his POV...because people love to use that as 'evidence'. But what’s clear is that he’s jealous of the bond. Envious of not having one of his own. Not because he specifically wants Elain for who she is, but because he’s seeing a pattern with his brothers. They both got a mate. A sister. And he didn’t. It’s less about Elain and more about “why wasn’t I chosen too?”

When he thinks about Elain, he never reflects on what makes her special or unique to him. Not once.

And this is supposed to be romantic and \*real\*?

\---

Then there’s the unworthiness narrative that keeps getting regurgitated. Azriel didn’t feel worthy with Mor either. Did that lead to anything good? (No...) And when he was in love with Mor, he didn’t stay away from her. Yet with Elain? He stays away. Repeatedly.

Why do we want him to keep chasing relationships where he feels unworthy? Why is it okay that he just...accepts that now? Why do Elriels dismiss the fact that Az didn’t push back against Rhys’s command? Not where it mattered anyway.

If he really, truly had feelings for Elain, wouldn’t he have resisted in some way?

Sure. He raged. He insulted Lucien. Was arrogant. He stamped his foot. But in reality, Azriel did nothing. Words vs actions? Where are we with that?

And coming from the guy who went to war while hurt. ""Chain me to a tree, Rhys""? He has it in him. Yet he didn't choose \*her\*.

And somehow Elain is supposed to be fine with that? We are supposed to be fine with that on her behalf? After what she been through with Grayson...being unwanted and not fought for?

She deserves more than being someone’s passive longing.

And if Az won’t fight for her now, why is it supposed to be romantic that they’ll “work through it” later? Why is Elain expected to ignore his actions and thoughts?

Every time I think of Elriel, I imagine the entire scenario being thrown into a subreddit in ""relationships"", and for every single comment to respond with ""it's toxic and they both should move on"" or something similar. Because that's literally what would happen here.

\---

Also...this really can’t be stressed enough...how is it healthy for either of them to jump into something serious when Az has spent 500 years hung up on Mor and Elain is still dealing with her failed engagement? Where’s the growth for either of them?

Or better yet...where’s the choice?

Because Elain has done nothing to actively choose Azriel. Not when it comes to emotional connection. Not when it comes to conversation or closeness or curiosity.

And part of that? She’s spent this whole time avoiding the one choice she should be making: Whether to accept or reject her bond with Lucien.

Instead of confronting the bond, she’s found the perfect distraction in Azriel.

And let’s not forget: Elain hasn’t claimed her magic, either. She hasn’t chosen her own future, her voice, her power. Until she does that...until she becomes someone who chooses herself first...how can she possibly choose a partner?

\---

And now the biggest point that I never hear about: What about Elain?

She’s done nothing...absolutely nothing....to get closer to Azriel. She hasn't sought him out. She hasn’t asked about his life. His scars. His shadows. His work. His dreams. His pain. She hasn’t tried to get to know him on a personal level at all.

And that’s not how people behave when they actually \*like\* someone. If you care about someone, you find ways to be around them. You ask questions. You're curious. Especially when Lucien is away so often. So, what’s stopping her?

She’ll tend gardens for strangers, but doesn't ask Azriel for dagger lessons? To coffee in the city - even as friends? Not ask what keeps him up at night? <insert something else she could possibly do to get to know him>?

Nearly two years...and nothing. This is supposed to be some epic love story? Why is this so invested in?

In SF, Az even drifts toward Elain and Nesta when Elain laughs. Instead of drawing him in...something so simple, so easy...to include him in on a joke...she dismisses him and claims to check on dinner. If she actually cared about him, why would she do this?

\---

And Azriel’s shadows?

They retreat around Elain.

Just like they do with the Cauldron. Just like they do when he laughs...(something we can assume happens fairly rarely, and which seems to *unsettle* them when it does)

People love to romanticize this.....to claim it means she brings him peace. That her presence is soothing to him. But peace doesn’t make you hide. And I highly doubt the cauldron brings peace.

His shadows don’t purr. They don’t curl around her.  
They *pull back.*

That’s not peace. That’s discomfort.

Azriel has had his shadows for over 500 years. They’re not some decoration....they’re *part of his identity.* Extensions of his instincts, his emotions and himself. How his shadows respond, mean something.

\---

More on the bonus chapter...the almost kiss, the “this was a mistake,” the returned necklace...happens around Chapter 58 of Silver Flames, during Winter Solstice.

Then the BR happens. Then months pass and the book ends in early spring.

And in that entire time?

There is not one single on-page interaction between Azriel and Elain from anyone's pov. No more glances. No small moments. No follow-up. No apology. No conversation. Nothing.

And in a SJM novel, silence is never accidental. It’s narrative intent. At least in this way.

If she wanted to keep the flame alive, she would have. She’s done it with every major couple before: Feyre and Rhys. Nesta and Cassian. Hell, even Varian & Amren.

But Elain and Azriel go dark.

That silence isn’t the beginning of a slow burn. It’s the end of a dead spark.

That's not romantic tension. That's called closure.

\---

Attraction. Infatuation. That’s what’s being confused for something deeper.

But it’s not love.

It’s not growth.

Not for her.

Not for him.

And after all this time, their silence says more than words ever could. Especially after the BC.

\---

Azriel doesn’t respect Elain’s agency. He doesn’t listen when she tries to claim it either.

She *wanted* to scry. She said so. She wants to stop being treated like a porcelain doll. And instead of helping her, encouraging her, or even asking how he could support that decision, Azriel went behind her back and told the Inner Circle she *couldn’t.* That it was too dangerous. Too dark. And he said it without her in the room, as if its his decision. (and talk about a moment he could have supported her. A lot of us would commend him for doing so....and yet?)

\---

Elain has said outright that the bond feels like it takes her choice away. And Azriel? Instead of supporting that, instead of saying *I see you*, he’s throwing a quiet tantrum that she should have been *his* mate instead.

Let’s talk about THAT double standard.

Lucien gets dragged through the thorns for acknowledging the bond. For offering Elain gloves for gardening. For trying. For being confused and awkward - but never pushy. For being respectful.

But Azriel? Az gets a pass. He’s “romantic” for being jealous. For wanting to *override fate* and *claim* her as his mate instead - when she already told everyone else that the bond felt like a cage. That she didn’t need a male. The same logic used to demonize Lucien gets twisted into a love story when it’s Azriel doing it.

Azriel didn’t just dismiss Elain’s power. He dismissed her autonomy too, AND he wanted to possess her in the very way she said she didn’t want to be possessed.

And that’s not love either. It’s a form of control...for not wanting her to scry and for claiming he should be her mate instead.

Call it what it is - because when Tamlin did it, we all saw it.

\---

Where’s the Reward?

If Elriel were to be endgame, you’d expect a reward that matches the weight of their obstacles, silence, and stalled development.

And yet...when you lay it all out?

The reward is barely there. It’s mostly imagined...not canon stubstance. -- and, a lot of the *moments* elriels claim - are during periods of Elains emotional state while she is actively grieving Grayson, and Azriel is still hung up on Mor...

So what is it really?

1. Two quiet, overlooked people finally finding love?

What it promises: That the brooding shadowsinger and the gentle sister, both of whom fade into the background, finally get to be seen.

Reality check: They’ve had years to \*see\* each other...build something....and haven’t. Elain hasn’t made one effort to know Azriel as a person. Azriel hasn’t described a single thing he loves about Elain beyond surface longing or her beauty.

This reward only works if you believe attraction = understanding. And SJM doesn’t write love that way.

2. Azriel finally being “chosen.”

What it promises: That the third brother, who always stands in the shadows, finally gets his turn. A sister for every brother.

Reality check: This has nothing to do with Elain as a person...and everything to do with pattern-filling. Azriel deserves love, yes. But not from someone who doesn’t see him, doesn’t know him, hasn't even tried, and hasn’t fought for him either. They are mirrors of each other.

That’s not love. That’s just symmetry.

3. Elain proving she can make her own choice.

What it promises: That Elain will reject the bond and follow her heart instead.

Reality check: We’d need to actually see Elain’s heart. And we haven’t. If she chooses Azriel, it must be earned...through conversation, action, emotional intimacy. So far, she’s chosen mostly avoidance of him, of her own powers, and of her current bond.

Until Elain chooses herself...her magic, her truth...her choice means very little.

4. They’re both “gentle,” so they *must* work.

What it promises: That softness deserves softness. That they can give each other peace.

Reality check: Azriel is not emotionally soft. He’s repressed, wounded, and aching for something deeper, and it doesn't even remotely call in his line of work. It would seem he isn't even ready for it either, he needs to do a little soul searching and self-healing first. Elain is not emotionally available. She’s avoidant, passive, and has been afraid of her own transformation. Together, they enable each other’s silence. Which has been proven time and time again on page. They can't be good for each other if they aren't good for themselves first.

Real peace comes after struggle, not in the absence of it.

So what’s left?  
Longing.  
Silence.  
—Glances.  
—Vague attraction.  
—A kiss that didn’t happen.  
—A gift returned.  
—A rejection by both of them.  
—Azriel keeping Elain on a pedestal - idealized and too fragile to challenge. Not trusting her to hone her own magic. Not seeing her as someone with power or agency.

Is *that* the reward?

Because here’s the truth: Every other SJM couple gets a reward that matches the journey.

—Feyre and Rhys: Partnership. Healing. Power.

—Nesta and Cassian: Growth. Self-worth. Redemption.

But Elriel?

The reward would be what?

More silence that finally gets a few lines of dialogue?

\---

Silence in SJM Romance: Let's compare, shall we?

One of the most common defenses of Elriel is that silence between them might mirror the silence seen in other SJM endgame couples...particularly Nesta and Cassian. But when you look closely at how Sarah writes romantic silence across her series, it becomes very clear: Silence only lasts when there’s something underneath it... 

1. Feyre & Rhysand

Their early silence is brief and full of tension, hidden meaning, and mental communication. As soon as they are in the same space, they push each other emotionally.

2. Nesta & Cassian

This is the most cited comparison. But their silence is laced with emotion. It's angry. Active. Cassian continues to show up. Nesta pushes him away. They’re both reacting, hurting, struggling. Their silence never sits still…it builds toward confrontation and, eventually, intimacy and SO much growth. And it happens AFTER one of the most emotional moments in the series - ""I will find you in the next life"". It also mostly happens off page, with the pass of time...because let’s face it, silence between characters on page in a love story is a snooze fest. 

3. Bryce & Hunt - don't come for me Brycriels, I'm just pointing out how our current couples are written <3

Their silence is momentary and centered around betrayal...but Bryce demands clarity, and their bond deepens through emotional honesty and dialogue amongst a commitment to each other (and its even deeper than this honestly).

4. Aelin & Rowan

Their early dynamic involves emotional resistance...but never withdrawal. Even when secrets are held, there’s sparring, tension, challenge. Silence is filled with emotion and eventually broken through communication and vulnerability.

Now compare this to Elriel:

\- No emotional confrontation.

\- No true build-up. 

\- No release.

\- No private conversations, vulnerability, or tension to resolve.

Their silence isn’t charged...its hollow. It doesn’t move. It doesn’t evolve. It precedes their climax and follows rejection, and it stretches for months.

\---

I see so many elriels holding on to these little itty bitty moments.....but what’s the point of the crumbs if the cake’s already been thrown out?

Small moments—glances, soft words, a shared breath....only matter when they build toward something. But with Elain and Azriel, the big moment....the one that was supposed to confirm everything....ended in mutual retreat.

So when people point to “he looked at her with longing” or “she gave him a smile”....okay?

How does that stand next to rejection, more silence, and shutdown?

If the climactic moment broke them, then the little ones aren’t buildup anymore.

They’re remnants of something broken.

Tiny, tender, romanticized gestures mean nothing if the emotional center doesn’t hold. And, of course it didn't, because there isn't one.

\---

Elriels often say it was all just a misunderstanding. A miscommunication. That Azriel didn’t mean *“This was a mistake.”* That Elain returned the necklace because she was hurt. That they’re still circling each other, waiting for the “right moment.”

But the truth was crystal clear...

Azriel labeled the moment a mistake.  
Elain didn’t object. She apologized.  
He left her and listened to Rhys.  
She returned the gift.  
No note. No confession. No second chance.

He gave the gift away.

They both went separate ways. Neither of them dug their heels in.

And neither of them fought for it afterward.  
No follow-up. No accidental run-ins. Nothing.

Two people in love don’t walk away without trying. At least *one* of them always fights. But here? They both chose silence...again...

This is what the other needs? This is the best choice for either of them?

And no, it’s not because it “wasn’t Elain’s book.” Every other ship has progressed *outside their POV*:

• Rhys fought for Feyre in her book.

• Cassian bled for Nesta before hers.

• Rowan pursued Aelin long before we were in his head.

SJM always lays groundwork before a love story begins.

She didn’t lay groundwork for Elriel. She gave them a quiet ending to....whatever it is they were for each other.

\---

The Real Miscommunication?

It’s not between Elain and Azriel.

It’s between *readers* and what SJM actually wrote.

Because in canon, this wasn’t longing held back - it was an opportunity, the necklace scene was the moment, and *neither* of them took it.

Azriel said, *“This was a mistake.”*  
And Elain didn’t argue. She didn’t fight.  
*She literally agreed with him*—by saying *“I’m sorry”* and returning the necklace.

That wasn’t miscommunication. That was a mutual acknowledgment.

And yes - Elain is Lucien’s mate. That’s a complicated layer.  
But mates can be rejected. And still, she didn’t choose Azriel. Not emotionally. Not magically. Not at all. She has had ample opportunity to tell Lucien she didn’t want him around. That she didn’t want his gifts. That she is rejecting the bond to be with Azriel because she *loves him.*

And what did she do?

If Elain wanted him, she would’ve said so.  
If Azriel loved her, he would’ve tried harder.  
If it were real - it would’ve moved forward. It didn’t.

\---

But hey - there’s still time to let go of the ghost of what never was. Some ships are built on silence and stagnancy. Others on healing and light. Gwyn supremacy is right there - a thing of secret, lovely beauty, sparking in the chest if you dare to look.

(And for the record, I didn’t bring Gwyn into this whole explanation of why Elriel doesn’t work - because, to quote Azriel himself, *I didn’t need to resort to it.*)

AND/OR —

There’s still time to stop chasing shadows and follow the thread that was always meant to lead somewhere. Elucien isn’t loud...it’s patient, waiting for two people still learning how to choose themselves first.

Lucien means *light.* He lived in Spring, is heir to Day. Elain loves what grows. The buds in her mind are sleeping - not dead. Maybe it’s *him* who helps them bloom when she finally lets him in.

The Cauldron favors Elain - we know this. It wouldn’t give her the wrong mate.

In the end --

What is it that you are all fighting for? To be right?

Because I think its pretty clear that Elain and Azriel aren't what the other truly *needs*.",13,1747140359.0,elgwynrielucien,27,0.68,False

Have you ever been in a conversation with someone and suddenly noticed... their breath?

It wasn’t just bad. It was *offensive*.

And worse — they didn’t even realize it.

Now imagine *you’re* the one in that situation.

You brush twice a day. You floss. You use mouthwash. You even chew gum like it’s your full-time job.

But still… it lingers.

That’s not just a hygiene issue. That’s a **symptom** of something deeper — something most people never consider.

And if you’ve experienced this yourself, or even just seen it in others, I want you to understand something:

**Bad breath is rarely about what you do on the surface. It’s about what’s going on beneath it.**

# What Most People Don’t Know…

Most people believe bad breath comes from food, coffee, or poor brushing habits.

But here’s the truth: those are just *symptoms*.

The real cause? A hidden imbalance in your mouth — an overgrowth of certain bacteria that thrive in the dark, moist environment behind your tongue and between your teeth.

These bacteria don’t just make your breath smell bad. They can lead to plaque, gum disease, and even more serious health problems down the line.

And yet… no one talks about it.

No one tells you how to fix it — at the source.

That’s why so many people keep trying the same things over and over again — only to feel defeated when nothing changes.

# But There Is a Better Way

If you’re ready to stop masking the problem and actually *solve* it...

If you’re tired of feeling self-conscious in conversations, on camera, or with people you care about...

Then you need to see what the experts are saying.

In a powerful 10-minute video, one of the world’s leading oral health researchers explains exactly how these harmful bacteria work — and what you can do about it.

This isn’t just another ""freshen-up"" trick.

This is a science-backed strategy that gets to the root of the problem — and helps you finally breathe easy again.

1klkzel,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoImmuneProtocol/comments/1klkzel/fatigue_and_low_for_me_heart_rate/,Fatigue and low (for me) heart rate?,"I did AIP about 7 years ago. After about 4 months of tweaking and never able to get off the elimination phase I gave up. A couple years ago I was diagnosed with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome and have been trying to avoid surgery. I was thinking before I give up I should give AIP a try again. I started weaning off coffee about a month ago and went full elimination phase two weeks ago. My current medications are NP thyroid and Lyrica. I'm thinking about quitting the Lyrica because it isn't helping my pain anyway but for now I'm still on it.

My resting heart rate is normally 85-100. Sometimes in the 70s. I guess it depends on the day. Since starting AIP my heart rate has consistently been low 60s or lower. In the last week or so I have been really tired despite sleeping 6-7 hours. I have had problems staying awake while driving. I have also had daily headaches and a couple migraines. I also have had increased chest pain but that is likely TOS and not cardiac since I've been doing a bit more in physical therapy than I had been. My upper body muscles are always fatigued because TOS but I've noticed more burning in my leg muscles. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it a delayed caffeine withdrawal? It's interesting because I feel like my orthostatic intolerance is improved since AIP but I'm just so exhausted I sometimes have a hard time staying on my feet because of that and not dizziness lol.

I'm definitely eating enough. Probably too much but it's hard starting a new thing to not feel like you're hungry all the time. I've been making sure I'm getting enough good carbs. Sometimes fat is harder to get in but I'm working on it.

1klkwtx,https://i.redd.it/tsgr1ahdoj0f1.jpeg,What Surprised You the Most About Bali?,"Hey, Reddit!  

I recently got back from Bali and I’m still processing everything I experienced there. The island turned out to be completely different from what I had imagined. I want to share some of the most unexpected things I encountered and hear what surprised you the most!  

1. Roads and Traffic 🚗🏍️

The first shocker? The roads. Traffic jams in Canggu and Denpasar can be worse than Moscow at rush hour. And the motorbikes? There are thousands of them, weaving through every possible gap—even on sidewalks! The craziest part? Locals ride without helmets, carrying kids, oversized loads, and somehow still avoid accidents.  

 2. ""Bali Rain"" Is a Whole Experience ☔️

I thought tropical rain was just heavy rainfall. Nope—it’s like someone dumps an ocean on you in five minutes. Streets instantly turn into rivers, and then, just as suddenly, the sun’s back out like nothing happened.  

3. Monkeys Are Not Cute—They’re Thugs! 🐒

Walking into the Ubud Monkey Forest, I thought, ""Aww, how adorable!"" Ten minutes later, one stole my water bottle, another tried to pull off my shorts, and a third screamed at me from a tree like I’d invaded its personal space.  

4. Prices Aren’t as Cheap as You’d Think 🍜

For some reason, people assume everything in Bali is dirt-cheap. But nice cafes, surf camps, and private villas with pools cost about the same as in Spain or Greece. And if you want decent coffee or avocado toast? Be ready to pay nearly big-city prices.  

5. Balinese People Are Incredibly Kind 😇

Despite the chaos, locals are some of the warmest people I’ve ever met. Always smiling, always helping—even when I accidentally wandered into a temple wearing shorts (yes, that happened). Their daily offerings (*canang sari*) on every corner add this magical vibe to the whole place.  

6. ""Bali Belly"" Is Very Real 🤢

Yes, stomach troubles hit almost everyone. Even if you stick to bottled water and ""safe"" restaurants. Apparently, local bacteria just don’t agree with foreign stomachs.  

7. Dogs Everywhere—But Weirdly Happy? 🐕
 
Stray dogs sleep on roads, wander beaches, and lounge in cafes, yet they seem totally content. No one chases them off, and people occasionally feed them. Though their nighttime barking? Next-level.  

8. The Volcanoes Are Massive 🌋
 
Hiking Mount Batur or just staring at Agung makes you realize how alive and powerful the island is. And yes, watching the sunrise from a volcano summit is one of the coolest feelings ever.

Though we kept some contact, it was kind of superficial. Somehow, I wanted it back - yes, ik, once it’s over, it is over.

Just some backstory - there wasn’t any sort of cheating, it was simply because things didn’t work out - and also because we ended up long distance for more than seven months.

Now the twist - I was getting done with my training, and maybe, a just a small part of me, was getting ready to move on. I get a text, from an unsaved but familiar number. “X has given me an offer letter” (X pertaining to the company name). Text 2 arrives, “Its in Kochi, I felt I needed to let you know”. My heart skipped beats, head whirled, felt all nauseated.

Couple days after - I had helped her regarding some onboarding formalities, before her asking (she might have not asked, still). We talked, she seemed a bit indifferent - but yeah, we agreed to have coffee.

The day - I was so fucking anxious. Still, I put on my best self and decided to wait for her to text. No texts in the morning. (Ofc I was kidding myself, why on earth would would she have the need to acknowledge me). “Lunch break, for sure, she will text”. Nope, no sir.

To clarify, the wait wasn’t for reconciliation - it was just to confront this anxiety, to see an old friend, to bid adieu in the nicest way possible, to put bandages to an open wound that might never be closed.

She had seen another friend of mine in the break. That gave me an ache.
I decided to text her as the day was almost getting over. “Am in cabin C, will see you”. I waited outside the cabin, heart thumping, blood rushing, hands all cold. I saw her through the glass. She was with a couple of friends (from college). She was happy, I guess.

Now, there she comes. “Hello”. (hello, stranger). She talked as if she met me for the first time, and as if I was a sales associate knocking on her door to desperately sell some books.
“Can we have coffee?”. 
“Sorry, there’s a brother of mine, Rahul, coming to see me. He works in infopark”. 
Why wouldn’t I know you have a brother? Why wouldn’t I know his name? Why wouldn’t I know he works here? 
The tone, the unfamiliarity, everything together was so much for me to handle. I left the place, a tear in my eye, disguised with my glasses on.

1klksj4,https://i.redd.it/hh9e1ygcnj0f1.jpeg,I don't think Cream will ever appear in the movies (or at least not with cheese),"This statement is based upon the fact we see the chao garden and cheese himself in the movie, stating chao as the creation of Japanese coffee shop owners and not as actual, living creatures. Of course, like in earth let's say, there's already hedgehogs, but it wouldn't make any sense if there's actual chao in other dimension. At much, it can be done as a earth native species but I'm pretty sure they won't do it, mostly because the whole thing about the sonic movies is that earth is pretty much the lame planet that we live in rn 

Now, for Cream, she's pretty much cream + cheese, we see it like that in almost everything. And if she happens to be introduced without cheese, there will be complain.

1klkraw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1klkraw/i_have_been_symptoms_free_for_nearly_4_years/,I have been symptoms free for nearly 4 years,"I would like to at first apologise to everyone for not sharing this sooner. I should have done it long ago but then again, better late than never. This will also probably be a long post so I hope you can bear with me.

I got diagnosed with what was termed ''prostatitis'' by two separate urologists at the ripe old age of 19. Having read a lot about this condition in the meantime, I can't blame them. The diagnosis depressed me, shamed me, made me fearful of intimacy. There were times where I had some dark thoughts. I didn't have many ups and downs in the process for a long time. For me, it was consistent. Ejaculation equals pain, urination is much more frequent. I didn't have erectile disfunction but the fear of developing it was immensely frustrating anyway.

Then, I began to notice a pattern. It would for example be 12 PM and by that time, I would have already gone to the bathroom about 5-8 times. I would be feeling the need to urinate again. Then I would get an invite for a coffee or beer with a friend at the local pub. I would tell myself to endure it at least until I got there so I wasn't late. ''You can hold on for 10 minutes.'' I would go to meet him there, sit down and since I am generally quite social, immerse myself immediately in whatever conversation we were having. Then, 4 bloody hours later, having had beer, coffee, sometimes both, I would realise I still haven't taken that trip to the bathroom and neither did I feel the need. At home, it felt like I would have to go soon.

Similar occurrences kept repeating and inspired me to explore the mental side of this issue. Then I discovered a man called John Sarno, a doctor and my life honestly was never the same. Inspiredby what the man taught and related in his works, I took a deep dive into myself and the history of my diagnosis.

The first thing was to realise when it started. It didn't come out of the blue in the happiest days of my life. It started when my family was falling apart and my dad was becoming more and more of an insufferable monster.  
Then I thought, was there ever a time when my symptoms were not there. Yes there was, a period of 3 months when I went to live and work in the US, a time where I had so many positive distractions in my life that having this problem was removed from the front of my conscience. I met new people, fell in love, learned new skills and I was ok. All of that was gone once I returned home. My father eventually kicked us out of the house, at the 3 am in the morning and after that, I spent 3 years closing my mind and heart to it all. My symptoms were never worse.

Then, I faced all of it. I explored myself, I went to therapy, I forgave dad everything even if we are not in contact. I let go of my rage and shame. I started to see and notice more. I started to have this ''I got you'' feeling.

The most transformative moment, the moment when the ''dam broke'' was when I was reading about how a UFC fighter I liked spent years struggling with a diagnosis called ''plantar fascitiis''. I read all about it, found out what it was and then forgot about it for around a week. 7 days pass, there is some stress in the family, my sister is acting out. My bloody heel starts hurting for the first time in my life. I start to wonder why. Then I remember what I read. I tell my brain to fuck off, I tell my issues that I know what they are. I, maybe ridiculously stamped my foot in an act of defiance. The pain was gone.

Applying this process to my ''prostatitis'' was not short. My brain wasn't going to forget the struggles, the fear so easily. But day by day, it came around to the notion I was ok. And I was. From the age of 24 to the age of almost 28 as of today, I have been symptoms free. I does not matter how much I have sex, masturbate. I does not matter if I drink a beer, coffee, Coca Cola. It does not matter if I get stressed sometimes. It does not matter that I have been powerlifting for two years, which many people say is terrible for the diagnosis of prostatitis. It does not matter that I don't do any stretches or therapy related to this issue. I have no pain. I can confidently say I am OK.

The most notable thing in this process was creating this ''higher authority'' in myself. It wasn't Sarno, it wasn't anyone else. It was me, the me who spent hours upon hours of work and thought to get to the bottom of this. Me who had so much evidence of this being a problem of the mind that sooner rather than later, I would have to start to believe it. The more confidence I had, the more concrete examples of this assumption I gathered, the more I was ready for this step. Eventually, whenever I would think about the problem, whenever the old fearful thoughts returned or the pain itself, there was something in me that would politely tell them to fuck off, something that knew I was ok and that was the only thing I needed to trust.

I do not wish to demean any of you for the problems you suffer yourself by claiming in a religious fashion that what I say is the only truth. The prostate, the pelvic floor, they are physical organs and tissues that themselves may go awry. For some of you, this might be the truth and maybe what I say does not apply. But if any of you can relate to might story and get some help from it, I would feel very fulfilled.

Thank you for your time and good luck in your own healing.",15,1747139601.0,Prostatitis,2,1.0,False

1klkqnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiSexTalk/comments/1klkqnc/from_classmates_to_cummates/,From classmates to cummates,"Let me tell you about this girl, Divya. We went to school together, but back then, she was just the quiet, smart girl with glasses who sat next to me in class.

Everything changed when we started having Sanskrit tutoring sessions at her house. We were 14, hormones raging, and those hours alone in her bedroom? Let’s just say neither of us paid much attention to the tutor. She’d kick off her sandals under the table and rub her bare feet against my legs. Soft, warm, teasing. Her toes would trace my calves, her eyes glued to her notebook like she wasn’t doing a damn thing. After a few weeks, her hand started “slipping” onto my thigh during lessons.

One day, she unbuttoned her jeans just enough for me to see the lace of her panties. I nearly passed out. We never kissed, never went further just a lot of flushed cheeks and shaky breaths. Then life pulled us apart. I moved away for college, and she stayed back.

Years later, out of nowhere, she texts me. By then, Divya wasn’t the shy girl anymore. Her Snapchat was a masterpiece, curves that could ruin a man’s sanity. 36D breasts, an ass that defied physics, and this way of biting her lip in selfies that made me throb.

We started swapping porn clips. She loved watching women cum; I loved watching girls suck dick. One night, I texted, “I’d wreck you doggystyle,” and she called me immediately. I came while she moaned about how wet she was. But life got busy, and we faded again.

Cut to It’s 2022. I’m bored in a dead-end relationship when I get a text: “Remember my bedroom?” It’s Divya - this girl I’d crushed on since school. My heart races. We hadn’t talked in years, but her message instantly made me hard.

Two weeks later, we meet at a cafe. She walks in wearing a tight black top that barely holds her huge tits. Her jeans look painted onto her perfect ass. She hugs me, and her chest smashes against mine. Jesus.

We don’t even drink our coffee. She leans close, her tits almost spilling out, and says, “Let’s watch a movie.” Her knee rubs my thigh under the table. And we went to a City Gold Theatre.

The theatre was empty except for an old man sleeping in the back. Lights go off. I grab her face and kiss her. She moans, opens her mouth, and our tongues clash. My hand goes under her shirt. Her bra’s thin and I squeeze her tit, pinching her nipple.

She gasps and yanks my belt open. Her cold hand wraps around my cock. I nearly jump out of my seat. I unbutton her jeans. No panties -just hot, wet skin. I slide two fingers inside her. She’s so fucking wet.

She jerks me off fast, her hips grinding on my hand. “Don’t stop,” she whispers. Her breathing gets shaky, and suddenly she shudders, biting my shoulder to stay quiet. She cums hard, squeezing my fingers.

Before I can think, she drops to her knees. She licks the tip of my cock, then shoves it deep into her throat. No gagging, just slow, hungry sucks. I grip her hair, thrusting harder. “I’m gonna cum,” I warn her. She doesn’t stop. I explode, and she swallows every drop, looking up at me with those big eyes. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand, grinning like she just won the lottery.

The old man’s wide awake now, staring, but Divya just adjusts her bra and says, “Your place tomorrow?”

“Hotel,” I rasp. “More privacy.”

She stands, buttoning her jeans. “Bring lube.”

1klknfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1klknfg/how_does_the_rainbean_mini_french_press_redefine/,How does the RAINBEAN Mini French Press redefine portable coffee making review?,"Testing coffee products is a daily ritual for me—a bit of an obsession, really. The RAINBEAN Mini French Press (model Mini) recently found its way into my kitchen, and I’ve been putting it to rigorous use. Compact, efficient, and stylish, it promises to deliver a great cup of coffee without too much hassle. But as much as I've enjoyed using it, there are a few quirks worth noting that might sway your decision.

**COMPACT AND STYLISH DESIGN**  
One of the first things I noticed about this mini French press is its sleek and compact design. It's crafted with German borosilicate glass for the carafe, which not only makes it heat-resistant but also super lightweight. The entire setup seems built for convenience, with BPA-free polypropylene for the handle and base, ensuring I never burn my hand while pouring. It's small enough to tuck into a bag, making it perfect for travel or camping trips. The black color gives it a simple and elegant look, but I wish there were more color options available. That said, the 12 oz size does limit it to single servings, so bigger households might want to look elsewhere.

**PERFORMANCE AND EASE OF USE**  
Using this compact coffee press is as easy as it gets. In under three minutes, I can enjoy robust, flavorful coffee. All you do is add coarsely ground coffee, pour in some hot water, and slowly press. The manual operation ensured I had full control over the brewing process, and I found that I could consistently achieve great taste with minimal effort. It’s worth noting that the stainless steel filter traps those pesky coffee grounds effectively, leaving behind a smooth, well-rounded cup of coffee. My only hiccup was the glass carafe—it feels durable, but I was a little paranoid about dropping it on the kitchen counter.

**HIGHLIGHTS**  
- Compact size makes it highly portable, perfect for camping or small kitchens.  
- Stainless steel filter ensures you get the oils and aromatic nuances from your coffee.  
- Stylish and minimalistic; it complements a variety of interiors.  
- Simple, manual brewing process allows anyone to experiment and perfect their cup.

**USABILITY ON THE GO**  
I took this little French press with me on a weekend camping trip, and it performed remarkably well. Its portable nature is truly its standout quality. Fitting snugly in my backpack, it didn’t take up much space or add noticeable weight. Plus, its simple design doesn’t require electricity or fancy equipment, which makes it a great option for outdoor coffee enthusiasts. Cleaning it was a breeze too—just rinse out the grinds and voila! That said, for those who dislike hand-cleaning, it is dishwasher safe, but disassembling it may get tedious after multiple uses.

**FLAWS TO CONSIDER**  
While my experience with this product has been largely positive, there are minor shortcomings:  
- The 12 oz. capacity isn’t ideal for making large servings, so this is strictly for individual use or small households.  
- Though the glass is durable, it’s still glass—accidents could prove costly.  
- If you’re using finely-ground coffee instead of coarse, the filter might not contain all the sediment.  

**ALTERNATIVE OFFERINGS**  
Compared to big-name competitors like the Bodum Chambord or the Aeropress, the RAINBEAN Mini French Press holds its own in terms of simplicity and portability. I found the Bodum offerings to be more versatile with larger capacity options available, but they lack the same travel-friendly design. The Aeropress, on the other hand, caters better to those craving espresso-like coffee and comes with fewer chances of sediment in your cup. However, both alternatives come at noticeably higher price points. The simplicity of the RAINBEAN Mini French Press strikes a nice balance between cost, ease of use, and quality.

**SMART SPENDING**  
For what it offers, I’d say this product scores high on affordability. It’s a budget-friendly way to enjoy rich coffee on the go with minimal fuss. You might be able to find French presses at even lower price points, but they likely won’t boast the same build quality or level of portability. Given its durable materials and efficient brewing system, it feels like a good investment for anyone needing compact solutions. Whether this is your first French press or a secondary one for travel, it delivers value without breaking the bank.

**Design and Build**  
The compact footprint of the unit is a standout feature, especially if you’re tight on kitchen space. Its black matte exterior gives it a clean and premium look. The dimensions, 11.02” x 7.28” x 12.67”, make it quite manageable even in smaller kitchens. Despite its lightweight frame of barely 1 pound, the coffee maker feels sturdy and doesn’t slide around during use. I appreciated how the removable tank simplifies cleaning — although squeezing it back into place sometimes requires a bit of precision.  

**Ease of Operation**  
One thing that struck me about this product is how approachable it feels even for someone who isn’t a morning person, like me. The button interface is simple to navigate. Whether you want a quick 8-ounce shot of energy or a larger 12-ounce serving to fuel hours of work, the three serving size options are perfect for customization. I did notice, however, that some experimentation was required when using the manual grind settings to get the coffee just as I liked it.

**Advantages**  
- Integrated conical burr grinder for fresh ground coffee.  
- Compatible with coffee pods (like the Keurig K-Cup) and freshly ground coffee.  
- 48-ounce removable reservoir for multiple brews without frequent refills.  
- Charcoal filter ensures good water quality for better taste.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The grinder can be noisier than expected, particularly early in the morning.  
- Some users might find the hopper’s capacity (100 grams) slightly limited, especially for frequent use.  

**Grinding Capability**  
Freshly ground coffee enthusiasts will love the conical burr grinder that’s seamlessly built into the unit. It grinds the beans into the HomeBarista reusable filter, which is conveniently tucked into a storage compartment on the side. While the hopper’s sealed lid keeps beans fresh, I found myself wishing for a slightly larger capacity on busier days when I had guests over.  

**Performance in Daily Use**  
The coffee was smooth, rich, and aromatic once I got my preferred settings dialed in. It did take me a bit of tinkering to find the right grind size, as coarser grounds sometimes caused weaker brews. That said, the integrated charcoal filter in the removable water reservoir really does its part to improve the taste, especially if your tap water is less than stellar.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to a Keurig K-Elite, the Cuisinart DGB-2 has a significant edge with its integrated grinder and reusable coffee filter. On the other hand, hardcore Keurig fans might find this less pod-friendly, as it doesn’t specifically optimize for their pods. While the Nespresso Vertuo offers an automated capsule system that feels effortless, it can’t match the customizable grind-and-brew experience you’ll get here. The tradeoff really boils down to whether you prioritize pre-packed convenience or freshly ground flavor.  

**True Value**  
Looking at its features, this coffee maker strikes a reasonable balance between price and performance. While other machines may focus on either single-serve convenience or grinding capabilities, the Cuisinart DGB-2 manages to offer both without breaking the bank. I’d say it’s worth the investment if you’re someone who values the freshness of ground coffee paired with the convenience of single-serve functionality.

1klknb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningTrainingShoes/comments/1klknb8/why_choose_new_balance_mx877_walking_shoes_review/,Why Choose New Balance MX877 Walking Shoes Review for Comfort and Style?,"Walking shoes are like the unsung heroes of everyday life. They’re always with you, taking on the gritty urban terrain, casual strolls, or even fancier walks around the park. My experience with the New Balance MX877 Cardio Training-M, specifically the Men's 877 V1 Walking Shoe, has been nothing short of intriguing—there’s a lot to appreciate here and a few things to consider. This shoe aims to combine comfort, practicality, and a classic design approach. Let’s figure out if they delivered what they promised.

**Timeless Design That Stands Out**

Straight out of the box, I was immediately drawn to the suede/mesh upper. There’s something nostalgic about its vintage appeal, combined with the modern adjustments New Balance made. It's not flashy, but its understated elegance stands out. My dad saw them and instantly decided he wanted a pair for his Sunday park walks. These shoes cater primarily to those who prefer a more timeless, neutral design. On the downside, the color options are limited, so if you’re someone who likes variety, you might not find something wild or bold here.  

**Comfort On Another Level**

Right after slipping them on, the wide fit was noticeable (I tried the 14 X-Wide). It's definitely a relief for anyone who struggles with narrow-fit designs. I had them on all day during a visit to my nephew's soccer game, and my feet didn’t protest once. The 11mm drop provides subtle heel support—I didn’t totally geek out on this until I found myself standing much straighter after wearing these for weeks. The soft rubber outsole and premium cushioning kept every step smooth. However, if you're after plushy, cloud-like cushioning, these shoes lean more towards solid than squishy.  

**[Check New Balance MX877 Cardio Training-M price on Amazon.](https://crosner.com/p/b00f5vh70k/)**  

**Performance Features that Matter**

Walking in these is no fuss. The craftsmanship, especially with the rubber sole, provides a grippy, stable feel. A normal weekend for me involves walking on sidewalks, gravel trails, or inside malls, and these shoes adapted to each environment effortlessly. The suede and mesh materials make the shoes surprisingly breathable. Once, I got caught in a light drizzle while heading home from coffee, and while the suede handled it fine, I was desperately avoiding mud to keep the light gray exterior pristine. A water-resistant treatment would’ve saved a lot of anxious moments.  

**Benefits**

- Perfect for people with wider feet thanks to varied size options.  
- Durable materials built for consistent daily use.  
- Stylishly blends vintage aesthetics with a practical function.  

**Limitations**

- Limited resilience against wet conditions.  
- Not for those seeking extra vibrancy in color or dramatic designs.  

**Target Audience for These Shoes**

Having introduced the pair to several of my coworkers during long office walks, the feedback was consistent. These shoes are ideal for middle-aged individuals, people with foot conditions requiring extra comfort (even eligible for Medicare reimbursement), and anyone who appreciates a retro design. However, if you’re someone who clocks in thousands of steps daily or is training for racewalking marathons, you may want something more robust or sport-specific.

**Competing Products**

Stacking up these walking shoes against others like Skechers Go Walks or Asics Gel-Quickwalk 3, it’s clear that the New Balance option excels in stability. While Skechers offers memory foam cushioning that feels soft but wears out relatively fast, the MX877 seems ready for long-term commitment. Asics, in contrast, might have the edge for athletic walking but doesn’t quite match when it comes to accommodating wide sizes or delivering a suede-textured style. 

**Affordable Quality**

Pricing-wise, you’re paying for a balance between heritage and performance. These walking shoes won't cross into luxury pricing but might inch slightly above no-name or budget brands. For the combination of domestic assembly and its reputation for durability, it’s money well spent for practical users. Just be patient if you expect the shoe to be your ultimate multitasking gear.

1klkn85,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaffeeWelt/comments/1klkn85/warum_ist_der_philips_serie_5400/,Warum ist der Philips Serie 5400 Kaffeevollautomat mit LatteGo die beste Wahl?,"**Design und Verarbeitung**  
Der Philips EP5441/50 aus der Serie 5400 punktet mit einem modernen Design, das sich nahtlos in jede Küche einfügt. Die Kombination aus mattem Schwarz und hochglänzenden Akzenten wirkt elegant, während die klaren Linien des Gehäuses den Gerätedimensionen – 30,2 x 47,5 x 49,71 cm – ein kompaktes, aber funktionales Erscheinungsbild verleihen. Ich liebe es, wie das intuitive TFT-Display ins Design integriert wurde und Benutzerfreundlichkeit ausstrahlt. Die robuste Verarbeitung hinterlässt einen langlebigen Eindruck, was ich für ein Gerät dieser Preisklasse auch erwarte. Ein echter Eye-Catcher, der seinem hochwertigen Anspruch gerecht wird.  

**Funktionen und Anpassungsoptionen**  
Ein Highlight dieser Kaffeemaschine ist die Vielzahl an Funktionen, die sie bietet. Dank der 12 verschiedenen Kaffeespezialitäten lässt sich fast jeder Wunsch erfüllen – vom Espresso bis hin zum Cappuccino. Besonders das LatteGo-System hat es mir angetan: Es ermöglicht cremigen Milchschaum und ist überraschend einfach zu reinigen, da es nur aus zwei spülmaschinenfesten Teilen besteht. Um die Intensität zu verstärken, nutze ich regelmäßig die ExtraShot-Funktion, die den Geschmack intensiviert, ohne ihn bitter werden zu lassen. Das Coffee Customiser Feature gibt mir dabei freie Hand, Aroma, Stärke und Milchmenge individuell anzupassen.  

[**Mal den Amazon‑Preis für Philips EP5441/50 checken? Klick hier.**](https://kaffeechef.de/p/b08cbjcq39/)  

**Bedienung und Benutzerfreundlichkeit**  
Die Bedienung des Philips Kaffeevollautomaten hat mich angenehm überrascht. Das Touchscreen-Display ist intuitiv aufgebaut, und die verschiedenen Getränke lassen sich ohne großen Aufwand auswählen. Besonders toll finde ich, dass bis zu vier Personen ihre Kaffeevorlieben abspeichern können. Bei uns zu Hause hat sich das als besonders praktisch erwiesen, da jeder sein individuelles Getränk mit einem Knopfdruck zubereiten kann. Die integrierte Kaffeemühle arbeitet geräuscharm und passt die Menge des gemahlenen Kaffees automatisch an, was für Konsistenz und Geschmack sorgt. Bis die Maschine nach etwa fünf Zubereitungen ihre optimale Selbsteinstellung gefunden hat, kann dies jedoch etwas dauern.  

**Herausragende Merkmale**  
Dieser Vollautomat bringt zahlreiche Vorzüge mit sich, die man nicht übersehen sollte:  

- Einfache Reinigung dank des spülmaschinenfesten LatteGo-Systems.  
- Personalisierte Speicherfunktionen für bis zu vier Personen.  
- Intuitive Steuerung über ein benutzerfreundliches TFT-Touchscreen-Display.  
- Möglichkeit zur Zubereitung von 12 vielseitigen Kaffeespezialitäten.  

**Schwächen und Einschränkungen**  
Trotz all der Stärken sind mir auch ein paar Punkte aufgefallen, die verbessert werden könnten:  

- Der Wasserbehälter könnte für Vieltrinker etwas größer sein.  
- Manchmal dauert die erste Zubereitung eines Kaffees länger als erwartet, da die Maschine die Selbstkalibrierung durchläuft.  
- Der hohe Kunststoffanteil könnte bei manchen Käufern den Eindruck von weniger Wertigkeit erwecken.  

**Produktrivalen**  
Auf dem Markt stehen zahlreiche Alternativen zu diesem Modell. Eine direkte Konkurrenz stellt beispielsweise der De’Longhi DINAMICA Plus dar. Während er vergleichbar viele personalisierbare Optionen für die Kaffeezubereitung bietet, punktet der Philips EP5441/50 mit dem einfacheren Reinigungssystem des LatteGo. Im Gegensatz zum Philips hat der De’Longhi jedoch einen größeren Wassertank, was für Vieltrinker ein Vorteil sein könnte. Der Jura ENA 8 wiederum beeindruckt mit einem kompakten Design und besonders hochwertigem Gehäuse. Was diese Maschine jedoch fehlt, ist die Vielseitigkeit der verschiedenen Getränke, die der Philips Kaffeevollautomat liefern kann.  

**Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis**  
Aus meiner Sicht bietet der Philips Kaffeevollautomat ein solides Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. Die Vielzahl an Features sowie die intuitive Bedienung und die robusten Anpassungsoptionen rechtfertigen den Preis in weiten Teilen. Natürlich ist er kein Schnäppchen, aber die Investition zahlt sich für Kaffeeliebhaber, insbesondere für Familien mit unterschiedlichen Geschmäckern, aus. Verglichen mit anderen Modellen in derselben Kategorie bekommt man hier echte Qualität für sein Geld, vor allem durch die einfache Wartung und das LatteGo-System.

I have a friend who was really close to me back in SHS. Now we’re in the same school, same block, and even the same circle in college. We were still close during the first semester, but in the second semester, I started feeling like she doesn’t like me anymore. Sometimes it feels like she does, but most of the time, it feels like she doesn’t. What’s more confusing is that she’s really sweet and touchy with our other friends, she used to be like that with me too, but now she feels so distant. I honestly don’t get her mood most of the time.

Since we’re always together, I noticed that she tends to complain a lot and wants things done her way. When that doesn’t happen, you can really see how disappointed she gets. I understand that it can be disappointing but sometimes she comes off as too bossy.

She also tends to judge our decisions, but when we give her the same energy, she doesn’t like it. There are times she gets annoyed when I can’t give her the answer during quizzes or exams. But sometimes, I’m just unsure, didn’t hear the question, or I’m afraid we’ll get caught talking. Most of the time, though, I help her and our other friends when I can.

One time, we were at 7/11 with another friend. We bought coffee and drank it there. When we were about to go back, I accidentally spilled mine and it splashed a little on her uniform. I apologized right away, it was really an accident. I get why she was upset since our uniform is all white (we're in medical field), but it was just a small dot. I still said sorry several times because I know how particular she is about being neat. But the whole walk back, she was still mad. She kept saying “bwisit” while trying to wipe it off, all the way to the classroom. I felt really guilty. It was my fault, and I didn’t know how to fix it. Even our other two friends stayed quiet because her mood shifted. She let the whole thing ruin her day.

Because of how guilty I felt, I started distancing myself. I stayed quiet when we were together. Eventually, she talked to me again during dismissal because we're always go home together and since then happened we still go to school and go home together. But i can still really feel the distance between us.

1klkj5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1klkj5y/my_name_is_gr3gory_part_1/,My name is Gr3gory part 1,"My whole life, I've been... unlucky. Whether it was having a broken limb every summer, getting sick every flu season, never getting good grades, or even just my hair looking dumb, styled both long *or* short, it was as though I was a magnet for misfortune. 


Very much unlike my twin brother Jeremy. He was the *best* at *everything*. He always had friends, always got the girl, the good grades, prom king, you name it, he had it. 


Even now, as we both were taking college classes, I was struggling; changing my major frequently, while Jeremy was flex coursing his way through med school. 26, finishing six years of credits in only three, and somehow had still made time for life outside of school, to spend with our mom, and his fiance. 


I still lived at home, so I saw mom daily. Honestly she wasn't too interesting. She had maybe 5 things she'd say on repeat, and that was it: ""You planning on getting out of bed today?"" ""Did you put any job applications in this weeks?"" ""Are you planning on cleaning your room, so I can finally do all the dishes?"" ""You need to figure out a financial plan, like your brother"" ""Are you planning on moving out soon?"" 


But when my brother came over, she swooned over him. Congratulating him on his most recently published medical article, or complimenting his fiance on her new necklace or earrings. She always had nice things to say to him: how proud she is, and how good he looked. How she never doubted he would become a dignified member of society. 


And you might think that, yes, I, Gregory, have a pretty lame life. Whether it be my own poor choices, or what the universe laid out in front of me. I suck. And I must be very depressed. 


And I would be...


Except I just got a letter. 


And I've been waiting until our family dinner, to share it with my mom and Jeremy. 


I wore my best button up shirt and my least wrinkled pants. I even tried combing out my hair. I could hear Jeremy and his fiance, Shelby walk in and trade greetings with our mom. 


I came down, almost giddy to help prepare the meal, which surprised my brother. Usually I snuck in, last minute, to eat and then go do my own thing. Throughout the next hour, they all eyed me curiously, until the moment finally came. 


In the middle of our meal, I stood up and announced, ""Guys, I'm moving out!"" 


They stared at me, a mixture of confusion and excitement. Jeremy, being an optimist, was the first to say, ""Hey, Greg, that's great! You found an apartment?""


""Nope"" I said still cheerful.


""A home? That's a pretty big commitment"" my mom chimed in, ""are you buying or renting?"" 


""Not that either"" my smile couldn't get any bigger.


Everyone was quiet, so I continued, ""I found our grandfather."" 


My mom gasped and immediately started choking on her wine. 


""Grandfather? We don't have a grandfather"" Jeremy said. 


""Well, that's what *mom* wanted us to think."" I said as I held up my letter, ""I just got this in the mail. It's from an attorney who was just assigned to Ham Spiegel, *our grandfather*. He had a will written long ago, that stated, in the unlikely event that he become ill, to the point of needing living assistance, *I* can get soul inheritance of his house, land, ALL OF IT, if I just go take care of him!"" 


""Long ago, but it included you, specifically?"" Jeremy swiped the letter from me. 


""You can't possibly,"" mom was still coughing, ""be considering going out to his property"" 


""Uh. Yeah I am! It's a sweet deal!"" I started getting a little upset. Why weren't my brother and mom as happy as I was? 


""Yup it says here: Gregory, and only he, has this opportunity"" Jeremy read.


Mom persisted, ""Greg please don't go out there. You don't even know him""


""Well who's fault is that?!""


""He isn't like other men. Not like other grandfather's. He was a terrible father, and I don't want you going near him."" 


I chuckled, ""What's he going to do? It says here, he's needing living assistance. He could be in a coma! I could literally just be changing shit bags, and saline drips. And in exchange, I get my own place! I thought you'd be happy to have me out of your house."" I grabbed my letter back from Jeremy and headed up to my room. 


Mom caught up to me, holding my arm, ""Gregory I'm begging you to please not go. There will be other opportunities. This isn't your only shot."" 


I stared at her for a moment, and smiled. She actually cared about me. She was actually begging me to stay. She was actually showing some interest in my decisions. 


But it didn't matter. I had made up my mind a week ago. I had spent the last few days packing my stuff. Surprisingly, there's not a lot of it. I only needed two suitcases. 


I stepped away from my mother, walked around the corner, grab those two suitcases, said one last goodbye and walked out the door. 



I thought back to those last few moments, as I sat in the train station. I also thought about what opportunities lie ahead of me, as I make a very unexpected turn in my life: meeting a man I never knew, seeing sites I've never seen...


An announcement rang out, and I got up to catch the train that would take me closest to the little town of Deepwater, Missouri. 


§


I had a few different ideas of what to expect, as the cab dropped me at the front of my grandfather's property, but the amount of trees and overgrown shrubs was rather surprising. The driveway was about a quarter mile long, and the whole walk down, there was no gaps between the twigs and foliage. 

About 60 yards from the house, the trees started clearing up to show an empty yard with a large brick patio. Of course it didn't look very empty, with how long the grass was. The patio needed maintenance, also: bricks were broken, chairs were rotten, and hanging plants had been dead for some time. 

How long had Grandpa been sick? And did he not have anyone else, out here, that could maintain the property? 

Well, I guess that's why I was notified. I wonder if the inside of the house looked any better. 

I walked up to the front door and froze. Do I knock? Do I just go in? Until now, this all felt like a dream, but as soon as I touch this door, I know reality will fall over me, like a heavy blanket.

As I reached for the knob, the door opened. I jumped back a little as I saw a man, who could not be my grandpa. He was maybe 35, in a navy blue suit. He carried a briefcase that I'm sure held all his emotions, since on his face he wore the most shallow smile I'd ever seen. This was the attorney. 

""Hi, you must be Gregory! My name's David."" He said, his smile widening, as he put out a very stiff hand for me to shake. 

After I reciprocated, he gestured for me to follow him into the house. 

Most all the lights were off, but with the sun shining through the windows, I could see how... stagnant the house looked. All objects were discolored from the amount of dust coating them. I feared touching anything, as it may result in a mobile dust cloud. 

David lead me to a study where we could sit and discuss my grandfather. 

""Alright,"" he said opening his briefcase, ""first off, thank you for being here on time. I'm used to these types of meetings, and sometimes I have to stay for a few days for a loved one to show up. Which is usually fine, but being out here in the thicket just gives me the heebie-jeebies. I guess that's just the city-boy in me."" 

He chuckled, but cleared his throat and changed the conversation, ""So anyway, I do apologize, I am pretty new to Ham's file. This thing had more dust on it than this house does! He made it about 25 years ago, and has never updated it."" He started turning pages, ""Well, I mean, he did everything to keep it relevant, but the one thing that always stayed the same was you. That you get everything, if you just come take care of Ham during his final time here on Earth."" 

He looked at me, expecting some sort of emotion. Or maybe any questions. But I just sat there quietly. He turned a few more pages, ""Okie doke, well that's about everything that relates to you, in this file, so if you could just sign here, stating you were informed, I can get out of your hair."" 

I signed all his forms, and asked, ""So... where's my grandfather now?"" 

David collected his papers and stood up, ""Oh, I do suppose that's something we haven't discussed. So now that these are signed,"" he held up his brief case, ""I can call the retirement and rehab facility in town, and a hospice nurse will get Ham scheduled to be moved back out here."" 

""How soon would that take?

He strolled to the front door, ""To get him back out here? Well it's a Thursday, so he could be back in the house tomorrow. Lucky it's not a weekend. Nobody would come out here on the weekend."" 

""Do you happen to know what his... condition is?"" 

David now stood on the porch. His eyes squinted, like he was remembering, ""I'm sure the nurse could tell you better, when they drop him off, but from what I heard, it was a stroke."" 

That scared me a little. I wasn't sure I knew how to take care of a stroke recovery patient. I guess I'll be talking with that hospice nurse quite a bit. 

I was so lost in thought that I barely heard David as he walked down the steps, ""I'm surprised he survived actually, at his age. Most 98-years-olds couldn't come back from something like that."" 

That made me chuckle. Must have been where my brother Jeremy got his genetics. My twin brother never got sick. He's even fallen from great heights and never broke a bone. Meanwhile I can't even eat eggs without going into anaphylactic shock. 

""You must really be special"" David said. Again, jolting me from my thoughts. Have they been thoughts? Had I been talking out loud? 

"" Huh?"" I said, caught off guard.

""Don't be offended, but I read through Ham's family records. He has two daughters, another grandson, and many in-laws that live out of state. He could have left his property to anyone. Or to all of y'all to fight over. But he chose you. You two must have a special bond."" 

With that, David finally turned and walked down the driveway. I saw him take out his cellphone, most likely to call a cab, or maybe the retirement home. 

That meant I had the rest of today to explore this property, and see if this house was even worth keeping after grandpa died. 

But first, I was hungry. I went back into the house and quickly found the kitchen. Most everything in the fridge was rotten or expired, and the pantry had mice. Well that would be first on my to-do list in this house, I decided. 

I filled a trash bag with old fruits, vegetables, and every box in the pantry that had a hole chewed in it. As I walked the bag out the side door, something caught my eye. 

It was my name. My name on a sticky note attached to a key. A key that definitely went to a vehicle. The attorney didn't go over this at all. As I took the key off the hook, I noticed my name again, this time on an envelope, on the counter. I opened the envelope and pulled out a piece of paper. As I did, a credit card fell out. 

The paper simply said, ""Don't go too crazy"". 

I stood there in disbelief. How could this be real? So many things ran through my head but the one that stuck out the most was my brother. Jeremy had worked so hard for his first car. He got it when he was 15, and did weeks if not months of manual labor to get enough money for it. And how excited he was to get his first real paycheck. He used it to take Mom out to dinner. 

I suddenly remembered how hungry I was. I stuffed the credit card into my pocket and ran outside to see if I could find a vehicle that matched this key. 

Right out the side door was a two-door garage. It held three vehicles: A '73 Pontiac Catalina, the station wagon model, an '82 Buick Riviera, *GOSH* I begged for that to be mine, but I could tell, with as new as this key looked, it had to belong to the '95 Acura. 

My heart sank just a little, but it was still a car, and it was still mine. Time to cruise into town, and see what the local food was like. 

The town was cute. Very Hallmark. The streets were clean. Every store was open and inviting. Even the families seemed like they jumped right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. As I was stopped at a light, a husband and wife walked across, smiling and holding hands, with their twin girls skipping along, in front of them. They all wore matching coats. The girls had tight golden locks. 

Passed the family, I decided to stop as Marla's Diner. It was pretty crowded so I figured the food must be good. 

Inside, the diner was just as picturesque as the streets. Families, dressed their best, took up half the booths. The mailman stood at the bar, chatting up the local sheriff. And waitresses, sporting old-school diner attire, swarmed the facility accordingly.

I was suddenly aware that I probably stood out like a sore thumb. I was still in the same slacks and button-up shirt that I had worn to dinner, the night before. Who knew what the condition of my hair was. Even if it were all in my head, I could feel the eyes judging me, and I quickly dipped into a booth in the back corner. 

A waitress immediately came up to me, ""Hey there hon, can I get you anything to start with? Coffee? Orange juice? Something stronger?"" She gave me a humourous wink. 

I blushed, and asked for tea. She quickly went to retrieve my beverage. 

As I sat, I noticed many people taking glances at me. Did I really look that awful? I turned my face to the window and tried smashing my hair down into a presentable style. 

""Excuse me"" came a soft voice from behind me. 

I turned to see an older woman standing there. She was short, with your classic snow-white perm, with a little purple pill box cap on top. She had a matching purple pantsuit, and bamboo purse. Beyond her, I saw at least six booth occupants watching our interaction. 

""Y-yes ma'am?"" I was very unsure of what she would say. 

""You look pretty new to the town. You wouldn't happen to be dear Ham's grandson would you?"" 

Again I said, ""Yes ma'am."" 

Her eyes lit up, and without asking, took a seat next to me, leaving her husband in another booth. A few other women came and sat across from us. 

""Oh, it's so nice to meet you!"" She said, ""My name's Sheryl, and these,"" pointing to the other two women who joined *our* booth, ""are Jasmine and Rachel. We're big fans of your grandfather.""

""Oh he's such a wonderful man."" Jasmine stated, ""We were very sorry to hear about his stroke.""

""In fact all of us in the diner, sort of, idolize him,"" Rachel chimed in, ""he's just such a wonderful teacher."" 

""Oh...um that's great. What exactly does my grandfather teach.?"" 

The women all looked at each other. Sheryl responded, ""Oh, just about everything. He's just so knowledgeable. Almost like he's on a spiritual level."" The ladies all giggled. 

At that moment, the waitress came back with my tea, ""I see you made some friends. Did you have an idea of what you'd like to eat?"" 

I hadn't even had time to look at the menu, but I knew what I wanted. I'd been craving bacon for a while, ""Yeah, could I get a lumberjack breakfast, but instead of eggs, can I just get more strips of bacon?"" 

The women at my booth went silent, and kind of eyed each other, and then looked at the waitress. 

The waitress said, ""Well, we don't carry eggs here anyway, hon, so I'll get that order out as soon as I can."" She gave me another wink, and turned back to the kitchen. 

The women all sighed and went back to there little giggles. I took a moment, to open the menu and did notice there definitely wasn't any eggs available in any dishes. Not even as ingredients. No hollandaise sauce, and the pancakes and waffles were made with bananas as a substitute. I personally love breakfast food, and since I'm allergic to eggs, this might be my new favorite restaurant in town. 

""By the way, you never told us your name, son"" Sheryl said sweetly. 

I took at sip of my tea, their eyes staring at me, almost in admiration. ""Um. Gregory."" 

""Gregory"" they all said in unison. 

Sheryl then shouted to her husband, ""This is Gregory! He's Ham's grandson!"" 

Suddenly a few other folks in the diner came over to shake my hand and introduce themselves. One mom brought her twin boys over to meet me. 

Definitely having never been the center of attention, I had no idea how to act. I tried making small talk with the twin boys, saying how I was a twin too. They just giggled and ran back to their seats. 

""Alright, alright, y'all leave this young man alone so he can enjoy the best hash-browns he's ever tasted,"" my waitress was back. As she placed the meal in front of me, the crowd dispersed. 

The only one left was Sheryl. ""Well, I guess we'll see you around town then, and definitely up at the ch- at your grandfather's place. It was very nice to meet you."" She got up and went back to her husband's booth.

The hasbrowns were good. The bacon was better. I ate the last strip, as I wrote a shopping list on a napkin. 

The town's grocery store was only a few blocks from the diner. Considering my grandfather's condition, I decided to stock up on broths, smoothies, and other things that were easy to eat. Perhaps I'd even look for a food processor or blender. If there's one at the house, I'm sure it's outdated. 

Down one aisle, a short, older man stopped and talked with me. Apparently word travels very fast here. He thanked me for coming to town, and how sweet I was to be taking care of my grandfather. I just shrugged and said it wasn't a big deal. As the little man turned to walk away, his posture made me remember that I needed to stop down the handy-man aisle and get some mousetraps. 

What all did mice eat? I feel like I remember some movie where an old farm woman was ranting to her husband about rats breaking all her chickens eggs. She'd go to collect, and all the eggs would be broken and the contents drank out. 

I decided that was a good place to start. It wouldn't hurt to have eggs in the house as another easy food for grandpa, also. But after the second complete walk-through in the cold section, I could not find eggs *anywhere*. 

I stopped an employee, and asked about an egg section to which he replied, ""Sorry sir, we don't sell those.""

Well that's odd. 

For a restaurant not to sell eggs is one thing, but for them not to be at the grocery store is a whole other level. 

Being allergic, I probably cared less bout this than someone else would. I decided some cheese cubes would be better for mouse bait anyway, so I grabbed a pack, and checked out. 


§


With the kitchen fully cleaned, stocked, and baited for mice, I could now explore the rest of the house. 

I couldn't tell you the age of this house, but I could say that it's whatever year they were able to make houses that looked tiny on the outside, but quite comfortable and spacious on the inside. Aside from the study and the kitchen, there was a living area, a den with a fireplace, two bedrooms, and... what was this upstairs? 

The upstairs was just one whole room, complete with gables. Almost as though, originally it was the attic, but was walled and insulated some years later. The room was red. Stacked and leaning on one wall were maybe 30 folding chairs. And on the other side, there was a podium, with some fancy symbolic displays behind it. 

I thought back to the diner and what the women had said to me about my grandfather:

*""He's just such a wonderful teacher""*

*""Almost on a spiritual level""*

Was Ham Spiegel a pastor? Did he hold sermons out here? 

Our mom never pushed any type of religion on us. In fact I wasn't familiar with any types of religious traditions. But as I looked out the gable window, toward the beautiful lake, just past the trees, I felt tranquil. This setting, out here in the woods, near the water, would be a perfect little religious getaway. For a moment I was proud of my grandfather. 

Respectfully, I left the upstairs, so not to damage any relics or ruin any spiritual energy. Though I was definitely curious. I would absolutely be asking questions about the... chapel? I guess you could call the upstairs a chapel. 

But for now, just seeing the lake, through that upstairs window, made me want to go walking out back. 

I walked off the brick patio, taking mental notes of some things that needed fixing. I would definitely need to get some good chairs for out here. It's too good a space to not enjoy. 

This whole property was too good not to enjoy. To think, grandpa lived out here, all by himself, for all these years. I wonder if that was what made him so wise. Walking through these trees, I sure felt at peace with the world. Being out here, it wasn't hard to shut out the hustle and bustle, and focus on those inner thoughts. 

Somewhere between the house and the water front, I came across a small clearing in the trees. The area was... eerie. There were children's toys everywhere. On the ground were tonka trucks and baby dolls, and multiple swings were hung in trees on the edges of the clearing. There was a seesaw, and also a little toddler playhouse. 

What was this? Why was this on grandpa's property? I thought back to the attorney's comment. He said grandpa had two daughters, and one other grandson -that grandson, of course being Jeremy, my twin brother. And all other 'in-law' relatives lived out of state. So there was no other relatives that this could be for. 

Oh but wait. If he had sermons upstairs, then maybe this area was for the children of the members of Grandpa's little chapel. But this was pretty far into the trees from Grandpa's back patio. I guess folks around here have more trust in their kids, just to let them go walking into the woods, with no adult supervision. Aside from that, what else could this area be for?

Even if it was harmless, the little clearing gave me an uneasy feeling. I ran past it quick, and soon reached the water's edge. 

I would need to put a bench out here. The maps in town would tell you this was a creek, and if so, it's the biggest creek I've ever seen. The water stretched all the way across the horizon, to where the trees on the other side were blurry smudges. The surface was smooth as glass. 

A few hundred feet out, there were two men in a row-boat. They looked to be chumming the water. They had a few buckets, with large chunks of some type of meat that they dumped straight over the side. I wondered what kind of fish must be in these waters. I looked down and kicked a rock into a shallow area. 

As I looked back up, the two men in the boat were staring right at me. They didn't have any expression on their faces. Were they scared? Did they think I would tattle to the game warden about chumming the water? I definitely didn't care about any of that, so to show them I meant no threat, I smiled and waved. Both the men reciprocated, at least by waving. Their faces didn't appear to change. I might have been thinking about it a little too hard, but the guys made me a uncomfortable. 

Suddenly there was a splash at my feet. I jumped back and saw the rock, that I had kicked into the water, had been tossed back out. I felt like that scared me more than it should have. I was breathing heavily. The men in the boat were still staring at me. I let out a nervous chuckle, laughing at my own demeanor. Then I quickly walked back to the house, bypassing the children's play area. 

So maybe the attorney did have a reason to get the heebie-jeebies out here. But after I've cleaned up the property, and removed a few things, this place should be warm and inviting. 

By the time I got back to the house, the sun had set. I figured I should make some dinner and try to get some sleep. But as I walked passed the den, I noticed a light-source coming from within. I walked into the room cautiously, and saw that the light was coming from a slightly ajar door. I guess I didn't explore this room enough, to notice it before. 

I pulled the door open the rest of the way and saw stairs. I didn't think this place could get any bigger, and now it seems I've found a basement. 

Only the light at the top of the stairs was on. I carefully made my way down. Maybe there would be more chairs down here that I could set up on the back patio. But as my foot planted on the basement floor, and my hands found a light switch, I realized this was a different kind of storage. 

Wine. 

It lined every wall, from Ports and Sherrys to Cabernets and Merlots. There had to be over 2000 bottles down here. So not only was grandpa a leader for a small religious group, but he was also a wine connoisseur. I wonder if he used it for religious reasons or if he just kept it around for himself. Either way, I had even more questions, that I hoped he could answer. I grabbed a bottle of Malbec and walked back upstairs. 

Having the basement, or I guess, *wine cellar* in the den absolutely made sense. As you walk back into the den, directly ahead is a small bar table, with a few different styled glasses. I grabbed a tall wine glass and filled it as high as I could. I myself, was *not* a connoisseur of wine. Perhaps, grandpa could eventually teach me how to be, but for tonight, it was all about getting relaxed enough to sleep in this new-old house. 

I curled up in a large chair, my wine glass in one hand, and a notepad in the other, and started making a list of everything that would need to be done to prepare this home for myself. 

Even though the property still belonged to my grandfather, it was hard not to imagine all the things I could do with it. Clearly I was no pastor. Definitely not a leader. There'd be no use for that upstairs chapel after he passed. I figured there'd be no harm in donating everything up there to a church in town. Then perhaps I can make the upstairs my personal area, and rent the downstairs to hikers and fishermen. Like a Bed and Breakfast. 

Who knew how far away this dream was from reality, but the thoughts fill me with excitement. Was is excitement? Or was it the wine? I didn't drink very often, and my head was spinning. 

This was probably a good point to stop writing. I placed my notepad and wine glass on the table next to me, grabbed a flannel blanket that was folded up by the fireplace, and snuggled up tighter in the large chair. Sleeping in this house might be easier than I thought it would be.

I like an intense coffee flavor with caramel notes or a nutty flavor (not a fan of fruity/acidic coffee). I'd appreciate recos that go well with Oat milk (bc that's what I use), and those na masarap pag hinaluan ng vanilla, toffee nut, or hazel nut syrup :) I'm looking to get capsules from Cozy Cafe PH (Piano, Fortissimo) but maybe you have recos?

1klkgna,https://www.reddit.com/r/pens/comments/1klkgna/i_feel_like_i_just_woke_up/,i feel like i just woke up,"I always had opinions on pens and pencils but never knew any terminology or even thought to voice them, it was more innate. Strong NO or YES reactions when I’d write with different pens, but I didn’t know it was something I could KNOW about. In school I mainly used a Pentel Twist Erase Mechanical Pencil (religiously and with disgust towards anything else - see the seeds of this were already here) so I never really learned pen types or even any other type of pencil. I hadn’t bought a pen in maybe a decade, and mostly just have those promo pens (which I now know to be Bic Clics) from restaurants and coffee shops scattered throughout my house/car/life. I thought I’d never buy a pen again bc there were always perfectly fine pens being doled out everywhere you go. 

Fast forward I’m a whole entire 30 years old, in grad school and have one of my first real, serious, holy-shit-i-actually-want-this-job interviews coming up and every pen I can find is from like, Mr. Champy’s Chicken Shack or whatever. I’m doubting everything about myself and stop at office depot on the way to the interview, grab a fresh notebook and some more “serious” looking pens, but nothing too crazy either -  I agonized over the decision and what image I was going to project for wayyy too long, and then settled on a 4 pack of Zebra F301’s. 

I could not believe my own reaction to writing with these. I was like “this is so silly, this is just another ballpoint pen, why can i not stop writing nonsense in this notebook?” I’m like this has got to be some premium brand, and I google it. Obviously reddit is full of freaks obsessed with weird niches (I’m from cast iron reddit so I’m familiar) so I quickly come to find that yes this is a well known entry level pen but is apparently rather mid in comparison to what’s out there, which only makes my reaction to a PRETTY BASIC ballpoint pen even funnier. 

I’ve now been lurking on this for 2-3 weeks and I’ve learned so much. I’m noticing the pens around my office, in the supply closet and on my coworkers desks. The other day I ended up staying later than everyone else, and I took a legal pad around the office and tested every pen I could find.

I keep trying to remind myself of the belief I held less than a month ago, that there is really no reason to spend money on a pen since they’re practically always available for free. I try to remind myself of my Pentel Twist Erase, that I can be satisfied with only what works for me and nothing more. I remind myself that I now have a 4 pack of durable, refillable pens, that I literally like and enjoy, but I can’t stop looking at vintage Jotters on ebay. And I know since that would open up the wide world of refills, it’s pretty much over for me after that.

Mils and Jenna have ZERO business owning a dog in that 600sqft. apartment. I'm actually convinced Jenna doesn't really like dogs, or anything that requires care. When she was with Jay, a reporter noted that their dogs (like 5 of them) were going to the bathroom in the house and drinking from the toilet bowl. Jenna took her little chiuahaha on the road with her only to pawn it off on her security guard when she wanted to take off and party. She's actually walked away from all her pets and her and Lior gave their dog away.

Mils and Jenna have a fern slowly dying in the corner of their living room. There's no way these two (let alone Jenna, if Mils has to be away for work) can adequately care for a Shibu Inu. Shibu Inus are a smart, active breed and they're high maintenance. They require a lot of training and mental stimulation so they don't turn to destructive habits like chewing on shoes or a door. They also shed a lot. Shibu Inus belong with active households who frequently get outdoors and do things like hiking or running. Jenna and Mils are such sloths they pretty much stay holed up in that one bedroom apartment unless Mils has to go to work.

It makes me so sad that they're bringing an innocent animal into all of this. It will absolutely 100% be neglected unless Mils is dedicate to being it's caretaker - which how can she when she works all day. I can only hope and pray that the breeder vets them and determines them not fit to have a dog (which is unlikely since breeders usually just want the $$).

Edit: Mils also doesn't seem competent enough to take care of anything on her own without supervision. She can barely take care of herself and adult tasks, like making coffee, are too much for her to handle.",60,1747138641.0,wtfjennajameson,53,1.0,False
