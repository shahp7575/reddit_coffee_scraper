I'm a very laid back individual, bi, a parent, and a lover of memes (if you have plenty to swap then bonus points).

What am I looking for? An online friend (future best friend?), vent buddy, meme buddy, maybe all of the above never know what'll happen.

About me: I have a very dark and inappropriate sense of humor, non coffee drinker my caffeine comes from my love of pepsi, I am a gamer but currently not looking to game with others as I typically just play single player stuff. I love stand up comedy and would love to know your favorites. My all time favorite is George Carlin. I'm a big wrestling fan as well as anime lover, and I mainly listen to rock and metal music.

If any of this tickles your fancy then feel free to send me a chat and tell me about yourself.",1,1735402190.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False

Any big suggestions yall would give to someone on the dark in this? 
I know mixed opinions but, was prescribed Ozempic, cutting out sugar and high carbs, 

But do I need to be checking my sugar levels? how do I do that? can I drink black coffee? I've read numerous mixed opinions on that. 
Do I just drink water and eat grilled chicken for the next 3 years till I lose the weight? 
I've saved a bunch of PD safe recipes and snacks, and I'm going to start working out. 
Is a morning walk good? should I be doing heavy cardio?

while we played hide and seek in the dark.

My shin hit the coffee table

and I can still feel the pain pressed fresh against my skin.

\_

Games of suspense and surprise

are thought to be child's play.

Bruises fade but my flesh holds memories

of the wear and tear of my youth.

\_

The routine of my girlhood

was a merry-go-round of misery.

There seemed no way off

the tradition of the only temperament we knew.

\_

I leapt off the route

of my preconceived futurity.

Feet first and reconsideration second,

I left my stomach on the ledge.

\_

I arrived to womanhood

bursting with vast, barren scapes.

I had no idea how to fill these years

with the joy I yearned.

\_

From flint to fire he ignited my heart

when I had stopped hunting the happiness.

He seeps into the crevasses within me

and seamlessly makes me whole.

\_

I find fulfillment within my purpose

that I stumbled on among my ruins.

My narrative demonstrates hope

and my passion is to change their story too.

\_

My future holds promise

and love radiates bright.

Hide and seek is actually pretty easy--

you just need to turn on the lights.

1ho8jyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1ho8jyd/observations/,Observations,"Sitting on the couch this morning having a cup of coffee and reading through some recent post. I just recently came back to Reddit because this relationship was good for a while, there was fire, there was communication, there was shared respect, and an appreciation for each other. In the past I used this app as an outlet of sorts to look at pictures for my alone time üòÇ. 

We met about 4 years ago at work, me going through a divorce, and her unhappily married but felt stuck and afraid because of her kids. We started talking and things clicked, we started fooling around in the car on lunch and breaks, and she pulled the trigger and filed for divorce. Fast forward to this morning with me and my coffee while she is still asleep and turning me down all week because in her words life has been heavy lately with the holidays, family drama, and the kids (we have two nights kid free, well one night now). 

She will go through spurts of sexual desire for me, and those moments are amazing, I desire her daily and enjoy taking control and devouring her when the opportunity presents itself. She gets overstimulated easily which kills any opportunity, she is also going through some changes with her body and feels uncomfortable with herself, even with reassurance from me daily, and uses those for an out for sex. None of this is a secret in the marriage and she knows when my attitude shifts that it is because of a total lack of desire or affection that I‚Äôm receiving. 

Three times this week I‚Äôve tried and she has denied me intimacy for one reason or another. I‚Äôm frustrated, grumpy, disconnected, and make comments to show my frustration with no resolution. I‚Äôve gone to solo therapy (even told my therapist I‚Äôve thought about divorce) but what‚Äôs the point of going alone when I already know what I‚Äôm doing right, I know what I‚Äôm doing wrong, and she continues to set cruise control and be ok with it. She knows she is lacking in department of intimacy but does nothing to improve, and won‚Äôt bite when I ask for joint therapy. 

I desire her so much I even think about her, and look at old sexy pictures she sent when I finally can‚Äôt last any longer and take things into my own hands. I‚Äôm just a frustrated lonely man at this point in life. ",1,1735401567.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False
1ho8j0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ho8j0x/500_days_of_sober/,500 Days of Sober ,"39m. This is the longest I‚Äôve ever gone sober since my first drink at 14. A lot of things have changed since I decided I couldn‚Äôt continue to live life on a cycle of being either drunk or hungover at all times.

Before I quit, I was drinking either 6 or 7 days a week. I wasn‚Äôt getting black out drunk, but I was drinking enough to be drunk daily. I never lost my job, in fact I got promoted many times over the last 8 years. I believe the anxiety from drinking caused me to be an over achiever at work due to the paranoid feelings I would have every day. 

I ignored many signs, including nearly dying from blood loss. 4 years ago, I woke up puking what looked like coffee grinds. It was also leaking out of my nose, and I had uncontrollable diarrhea of it coming out of me. I blacked out the on bathroom floor. Then again on my couch next to my 2 year old son at the time. Luckily, my wife was still home. After being rushed to the ER and blacking out again in the waiting area, I woke up in a wheelchair covered in the ‚Äúcoffee grinds‚Äù. A doctor was explaining to me I was throwing up digested blood. I had never seen it before. I was told I have at least a dozen ulcers they could see and I required immediate repair. They told me had I not come in when I did, I wouldn‚Äôt have woken up from the last black out and would have died of blood loss. The ulcers were obviously from drinking. I stayed off alcohol then for about 2 months, but then came back to it just as hard or worse. 

500 days ago, I just woke up one morning and realized I can‚Äôt continue like this. It was difficult mentally at first to replace the ritual. Weight lifting was the first thing I did. Then I began using the stationary bike and monitoring my calorie intake. The cost of joining the gym was nothing compared to what I spent on alcohol. I was 237 pounds at 5‚Äô8‚Äù, and now down 97ish pounds and weigh on average 150 pounds. 

I for once am able to save money. Something my wife and I never really did prior. 

I‚Äôm clear headed and feel great all the time now. I play outside with my kiddo more than ever. My relationship with him and my wife is the best it‚Äôs ever been. 

I quit my job. I realized I hated it and it also contributed to my unhappiness. I‚Äôve taken a job that pays less, and had significantly less responsibilities but it gives me the best work life balance I‚Äôve ever had in my life. 

The only thing that has changed for the worse is I officially don‚Äôt have any friends. When I drank I was more likely to reach out and say hi to people and keep contact. I‚Äôm finding out now if I‚Äôm not drinking, my buddies I‚Äôve had aren‚Äôt really there anymore. And that‚Äôs ok. I know I have the ability to make friends with people, I just need to reach out and do it again with new people. I‚Äôll get there. ",5,1735401492.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

1ho8hez,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ho8hez,Living room space ideas ,"Hi All,

Thanks for taking the time to read this! My partner and I bought our starter home about two years ago in the Northeast U.S. It‚Äôs a (I think) Dutch colonial with 3 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, and about 1,250 square feet across two floors. It‚Äôs a bit tight, but it works well for the two of us and our dog.

The living room, however, has always been a challenge for me. The elongated shape, combined with two large open archways and the front door right in the middle of the room, makes it tricky to design. I‚Äôve divided the space into two zones: the left side leads to the stairs and kitchen, while the right side serves as the living room. This setup works for us overall, but there‚Äôs one major issue.

With the sofa against the window wall, the TV viewing angles are awkward. The only comfortable spots are either the chairs on the left side or lying down on the sofa‚Äînot sitting. This has led to one of us often lying on the couch while the other ends up sitting on the floor. Another consequence is that I‚Äôve started falling asleep on the couch more often than in my bed!

As we‚Äôve started entertaining more, the space feels increasingly limiting. We usually end up shifting the chairs and coffee table closer to the stairs to open up the area. I‚Äôm struggling to find a layout that feels both functional and inviting. This seems to be a common issue in homes like this in the Northeast. My sister has a similar house and places her sofa where mine currently is, with the TV against the stair wall. However, I‚Äôve ruled that out‚Äîit‚Äôs too far from the TV, uncomfortable, and, in my opinion, not a pleasant setup.

Does anyone have advice or ideas for how to make this layout work better? I‚Äôd love to hear your suggestions! Please excuse the mess, it‚Äôs Christmas!",3,1735401371.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

1ho8f5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teethgumhealth/comments/1ho8f5e/teeth_whitening_with_coconut_oil_and_turmeric/,Teeth Whitening With Coconut Oil And Turmeric,"The Benefits of Teeth Whitening with Coconut Oil and Turmeric
-------------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever thought about brightening your smile naturally? Teeth whitening with coconut oil and turmeric is gaining traction as a popular home remedy. Both of these ingredients have unique properties that can help you achieve a whiter smile while promoting overall oral health. Let‚Äôs dive into the benefits and methods of using coconut oil and turmeric for teeth whitening.

### Understanding Coconut Oil

Coconut oil is well-known for its numerous health benefits. When it comes to oral care, it contains **medium-chain fatty acids** that are effective in combating harmful bacteria in the mouth. By doing so, coconut oil not only helps maintain fresh breath but also contributes to a healthier mouth. Here are a few specific benefits:

- **Anti-bacterial properties:** Coconut oil can help reduce the amount of harmful bacteria in your mouth, which could otherwise lead to tooth decay.
- **Moisturizing agent:** It keeps your gums healthy and prevents dryness, which can contribute to gum disease.
- **Detoxification:** Swishing coconut oil around your mouth can help draw out impurities, a process known as oil pulling.

### The Power of Turmeric

Turmeric is a bright yellow spice often used in cooking, but it holds incredible benefits for teeth whitening as well. Its main compound, **curcumin**, provides anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties that can enhance oral hygiene. Here‚Äôs how turmeric works wonders for your teeth:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Natural stain removal:** Turmeric‚Äôs natural abrasiveness helps in removing surface stains without damaging the enamel.
- **Anti-inflammatory effects:** It can soothe irritated gums, reduce swelling, and promote healing.
- **Antioxidant properties:** Turmeric fights free radicals which can contribute to oral diseases.

### How to Whiten Teeth with Coconut Oil and Turmeric

Now that you know the benefits, let‚Äôs look at how to use these ingredients for teeth whitening. The process is simple and can easily be incorporated into your daily routine.

#### Ingredients:

- 1 tablespoon of coconut oil
- 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder

#### Steps:

1. **Mix the Ingredients:** In a small bowl, combine the coconut oil and turmeric powder to form a paste.
2. **Brush Your Teeth:** Use a soft toothbrush to apply the paste onto your teeth. Make sure to cover all surfaces.
3. **Leave it on:** Allow the mixture to sit on your teeth for 5-10 minutes. This gives the ingredients time to work.
4. **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse your mouth with warm water. You may wish to follow up with brushing using regular toothpaste.

### Frequency of Use

To see the best results, it‚Äôs advisable to use this teeth whitening remedy 2-3 times a week. Over time, you may notice your teeth appearing visibly whiter and healthier. However, it‚Äôs essential not to overdo it to prevent any potential sensitivity.

### Additional Tips for Optimal Results

In addition to using coconut oil and turmeric, here are some additional practices to help enhance your teeth whitening regimen:

- **Maintain Oral Hygiene:** Brush and floss daily to keep your mouth clean.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to help wash away food particles and bacteria.
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** Limit consumption of foods and drinks that can stain your teeth, such as coffee, tea, and red wine.

Teeth whitening with coconut oil and turmeric into your dental care routine can lead to a brighter smile and improved oral health. It‚Äôs a natural and effective alternative to commercial whitening products. So why not give it a try? Your smile deserves it!

Comparing Natural Teeth Whitening Methods: Coconut Oil and Turmeric vs. Commercial Products
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brighter smile, many people are exploring natural remedies as alternatives to commercial teeth whitening products. Specifically, coconut oil and turmeric have gained attention for their potential benefits. In this article, we will dive into how these natural methods stack up against the conventional options available in the market.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### The Natural Power of Coconut Oil

Coconut oil, known for its numerous health benefits, is often used in mouth rinsing practices called oil pulling. This ancient technique involves swishing coconut oil in your mouth for 10-20 minutes. Many believe it can help in reducing plaque, fighting bad breath, and potentially whitening teeth. Here‚Äôs how coconut oil supports oral health:

- **Anti-Bacterial Properties:** Coconut oil contains lauric acid, which is known for its ability to fight harmful bacteria in the mouth.
- **Stain Reduction:** Regular use may help to lift and dissolve stains from foods and drinks.
- **Enamel Protection:** It's gentle on enamel, making it a safer long-term option.

### The Brightening Benefits of Turmeric

Turmeric, known for its vibrant yellow color, is another natural option people use for teeth whitening. Its key component, curcumin, offers anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. Here's how turmeric can benefit your smile:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Naturally Whitens Teeth:** Turmeric can help in breaking down stains on the teeth's surface.
- **Promotes Gum Health:** Its anti-inflammatory properties may assist in reducing gum inflammation.
- **Easy Application:** Mixing turmeric with a bit of coconut oil creates a paste that can be easily applied to your teeth.

### Commercial Whitening Products

On the flip side, numerous commercial teeth whitening products are available today, ranging from whitening strips to professional treatments. Here's what they offer:

- **Quick Results:** Many commercial products can deliver noticeable results in as little as a few days.
- **Variety of Options:** There are multiple types of products, including gels, strips, and even light-activated systems.
- **Professional Treatments:** Dentists can provide in-office whitening options that are highly effective and safe.

### Comparing Effectiveness

While both coconut oil and turmeric have their fans, their effectiveness can vary greatly compared to commercial products:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Time to Results:** Natural methods may take longer to show results, often requiring consistent use over weeks or months.
- **Stain Types:** Coconut oil might work better for some types of stains, while turmeric may be more effective on others.
- **Sensitivity:** Natural remedies are generally kinder on sensitive teeth compared to some commercial options that may cause discomfort.

### Cost Comparison

Cost is another factor to consider when weighing your options:

- **Coconut Oil:** Usually inexpensive; a jar can last a long time.
- **Turmeric:** Also affordable, especially when purchased in bulk.
- **Commercial Products:** Prices can range from $20 to $200 depending on the brand and method used.

### Potential Side Effects

It's important to note that natural does not always mean without risk. Here are possible side effects:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Staining:** Turmeric, if not rinsed thoroughly, can leave a yellow tint on teeth and gums.
- **Allergic Reactions:** Some people may be allergic to coconut or turmeric, leading to irritation.
- **Overuse Issues:** Excessive oil pulling may lead to a change in oral flora.

Ultimately, the choice between coconut oil and turmeric versus commercial teeth whitening products will depend on personal preference, dental health, and desired results. While natural methods are appealing for their gentleness and cost-effectiveness, commercial options can provide quicker results for a brighter smile. It's advisable to consult with a dentist before embarking on any whitening regimen to ensure it's the right fit for you.

### Conclusion

Embracing teeth whitening with coconut oil and turmeric offers a natural alternative that many find appealing. Both ingredients are celebrated not only for their whitening properties but also for their overall oral health benefits. Coconut oil is well-known for its antibacterial properties, which help reduce harmful bacteria in the mouth, promoting healthier gums. Turmeric, with its anti-inflammatory qualities, can soothe irritation, contributing to an enhanced oral environment.

When comparing natural methods like coconut oil and turmeric to commercial products, it becomes clear that while the latter may offer quick results, they often come with harsh chemicals that can damage enamel or lead to increased sensitivity. Natural remedies provide a gentler approach, reducing the risk of adverse effects while still offering a brighter smile over time.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Additionally, making a paste from these ingredients is simple, cost-effective, and free from the additives often found in store-bought whitening agents. With consistent use, you may find that your teeth not only look whiter but also feel healthier and more robust.

Choosing to incorporate coconut oil and turmeric into your oral care routine can transform your approach to teeth whitening. By opting for these natural alternatives, you‚Äôre taking a step towards a radiant smile that reflects both beauty and wellness. As you explore this journey, know that a brighter smile can indeed begin at home with these amazing ingredients. The choice is yours to make, and the results can be both satisfying and empowering.

He isn't in a good physical health so I a happy to be here to help him. Then I have bad days too.

I currently work at Buffalo Wild Wings. I got home around midnight last night but didn't really get to sleep around 4 in the morning. It was because of the pain and my mind would keep racing. I finally got to sleep then around 7 I heard my step mom outside my room talking to the dogs. I went back to sleep by 7:30 and got up at 10. They were having breakfast so I got mine. I am not a morning person so I had to go sit down and wake up before I did anything else.

Then all of a sudden my dad is doing the dishes and cleaning his wife's coffee pot. For one his wife could be cleaning her coffee pot not him. As far as the dishes I would be doing them just not right after I wake up. Now he is mad at me because he ""had to do"" the dishes. I am in pain, still tired and didn't have a good night at work. I just want to wake up before I do the dishes. Do I do something wrong?

**CHAPTER SUMMARIES:**

**CHAPTER 46 - CLARISSA:**

Clarissa watches Ashford give angry orders as he attempts to keep the ship under his control.¬† Monica Stuart and Anna start their broadcast to appeal for total system shutdowns, so Ashford orders an assault on the broadcast center.¬† Ruiz is still working on undoing all of Sam‚Äôs sabotages, so Ashford yells at her and then demands that they at least line up the shot the laser will take when it‚Äôs functional.¬† Holden and his team begin their effort to gain control of engineering, so Ashford puts four people into the confiscated Martian power armor and sends them to stop the assault and kill everyone who‚Äôs not on their side.¬† The environmental controls are remotely adjusted to knock out everyone on the bridge, so Ashford shouts at people until Clarissa fixes it for him. (And he doesn‚Äôt even [thank her](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/347e386d-aa38-46f2-b37a-05412a41e2aa)?!?)¬† In short, he‚Äôs becoming increasingly unhinged and out of control as his people and his plan meet resistance from multiple angles.¬† As she watches, Clarissa starts to contemplate the concepts of sacrifice and redemption.¬† Maybe it‚Äôs her conscience pricking her, maybe it‚Äôs watching Anna plead for everyone‚Äôs lives amid sounds of gunfire, or maybe it‚Äôs watching Ashford spiral and tantrum like a toddler.¬† Cortez tells Clarissa there is always a chance at redemption, although it often requires painful sacrifice.¬† He thinks the plan described by Anna - to save everyone and get them home, but open the possibility of alien attacks from the Ring on the rest of humanity - is selfish, but Clarissa seems to disagree. .¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 47 - HOLDEN:**

While Naomi and Bull work on holding engineering and stopping the laser upgrade, Holden and Corin are crawling through the elevator shaft to access the bridge.¬† Their plan is to wait for everyone to get knocked out by the environmental system hack and then seize control.¬† The problem is that the environmental systems have locked them out and Holden‚Äôs team can‚Äôt hack it.¬† All 15+ people on the bridge will be conscious when Holden and Corin enter.¬† Since this would be an impossible mission, and since Naomi has spotted the assault team in the [Martian power armor](https://www.therpf.com/forums/threads/martian-marine-goliath-power-armor-from-the-expanse.340898/) heading for engineering, Bull gives Holden and Corin a new job:¬† ~~stop~~ slow down the four people in the armor so Naomi has enough time to complete her tasks.¬† They will absolutely die doing this, because even without ammunition (Bull removed it when he initially confiscated the suits), the armor is so strong that they can literally just rip Holden and Corin apart.¬† But if they buy enough time for Naomi, she can stop Ashford‚Äôs plan to weaponize the laser.¬† Naomi and Holden prepare to say their goodbyes over the radio.¬† Holden has a moment of self-awareness where his ~~life~~ personality flashes before his eyes.¬† He realizes that he‚Äôs transformed from the self-righteous, insufferable guy who always thought he was right.¬† He‚Äôs passed through nihilism to become a man who sees the hope and the complications in humanity, who understands that situations are complex and nothing is black-and-white, and he just wishes he could be a part of making things better.¬† He wants to tell all of this to Naomi, but instead he just tells her he likes her and always has, thanking her for their time together.¬† She tells him she loves him, and they get all choked up until a giant screeching sound interrupts them.¬† Bull informs Holden that his mission has changed again.¬† Ashford has stopped the rotation of the drum, causing more catastrophic injuries to lots of people, just so the assault team in the Martian armor can get to engineering without encountering resistance in the elevators.¬† Holden and Corin are back to plan A:¬† they have to take the bridge‚Ä¶ but they have to do it while everyone is fully conscious.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 48 - BULL:**

The Martian-armored assault team enters engineering and all hell breaks loose.¬† They toss furniture and equipment like toys and kill people that get in their way.¬† There is nothing Bull and his team can do to fight back or slow them down.¬† Bull alerts Naomi that it‚Äôs time to bail, but she wants more time.¬† She‚Äôs dumped the core, but she still needs to get the laser grid offline.¬† Unfortunately, time is up, and Bull convinces her to leave before she‚Äôs killed.¬† At least alive, there‚Äôs a chance she could try again later.¬† As they try to flee, two of the armored men block their escape route to the drum, so they‚Äôre forced to jump into the elevator shaft and slam the airlock shut.¬† Following Naomi and Bull are Juarez and Cass, the Martian marines recruited by Anna, as well as Sergeant Verbinski and a man from Bull‚Äôs security team.¬† To get through the shaft, Bull has to be removed from his mech, so his lower body floats uselessly in the zero g environment.¬† He collects his ammunition and some grenades before leaving the mech behind.¬† The assault team is beating and tearing at the airlock, so there‚Äôs not much time.¬† Bull instructs everyone to put on environment suits and pull themselves through the shaft.¬† Juarez is able to shoot one of their pursuers, but Verbinski dies from his earlier injuries and when they reach the elevator, the security man is shot as well. (He never got a name, so I assume this guy was wearing a [red shirt](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Redshirt).)¬† Bull knows he isn‚Äôt going to survive the assault, so he sends everyone else ahead to help Holden and Corin at the bridge while he makes a last stand to give them time.¬† Monica Stuart calls him for an update:¬† they‚Äôre under heavy fire, the sudden halt of the drum has caused catastrophic damage and injuries, Anna might be dead, and they want to know how much longer they have to hold out.¬† Bull explains the situation bluntly: the bad guys are in control and almost all the good guys got killed.¬† Monica can‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs over, insisting there has to be a way to salvage their plan, but Bull has to go because the assault team is almost on him.¬† If everything works out, he says she should tell Fred Johnson he owes Bull big time. ¬† Then he meets the assault team, led by Casimir, with a grin and some grenades.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 49 - ANNA:**

You didn‚Äôt really think she was dead, did you?¬† Anna gains consciousness but is in considerable pain, floating near Okju, the camera operator who has been killed.¬† Amos is glad to see Anna is alive, and warns her to get out of the middle of the room.¬† He and a UN soldier are firing at Ashford‚Äôs assault team near the door.¬† Anna realizes what Ashford has done:¬† he stopped the drum suddenly to give his side an advantage, willingly sacrificing dozens or even hundreds of lives in the process. ¬† Anna heads to the radio room to help Monica get back on the air, offering to operate the camera.¬† Monica laughs at her and points out that their plan has failed and there‚Äôs no hope, so Anna bullies her into getting back on the air.¬† Another soldier dies, and Anna gets on the radio to get a mission status update.¬† Holden fills her in and explains that his group is trapped in the hatch until someone lets them onto the bridge.¬† Two more of the soldiers on Amos‚Äôs team die, but the rest of them open fire and push back Ashford‚Äôs team.¬† Anna realizes that Monica has abdicated leadership to her, so she broadcasts a message asking for everyone available to help fight back against Ashford.¬† To Anna‚Äôs surprise, Clarissa responds, wanting to know if Earth will really be destroyed if Ashford‚Äôs plan succeeds.¬† Anna tells Clarissa that James Holden learned it on the protomolecule station and asks Clarissa to trust that it‚Äôs true and to open the door for Holden‚Äôs team.¬† Cortez catches them talking and tells Clarissa not to listen to Anna, and the two pastors argue.¬† Anna repeats her plea to open the airlock door for Holden and his team, since they are the people who gave Clarissa a second chance and forgave her, who willingly risk their lives for strangers.¬† She points out that Ashford kills people out of expediency, and asks who Clarissa and Cortez would rather let die.¬† As Anna and Cortez continue arguing about the philosophical, spiritual and even [etymological](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sacrifice) facets of sacrifice, Clarissa makes her choice.¬† She opens the doors.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 50 - HOLDEN:**

Holden is stuck in the niche between the airlock and the elevator shaft, and Naomi can‚Äôt get the door open for him.¬† He can‚Äôt believe how catastrophically every one of their plans have failed.¬† Holden has been through so many ‚Äúlast stands‚Äù today that he isn‚Äôt even afraid anymore, just exhausted. The universe keeps [pulling him back from the brink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPw-3e_pzqU) every time he loses all hope. Corin alerts him to the fact that the two Martian marines are arriving, but Bull isn‚Äôt with them.¬† Juarez and Cass are down to their last rounds of ammo, and they tell Holden that the hold point has been lost but two of the four from the armored assault team are down.¬† They know Bull has died taking the second one out.¬† Corin wants to retrieve Bull‚Äôs body but Juarez points out that he is blocking the elevator and protecting them.¬† Holden orders her to pull herself together and save her grieving for after they complete the mission.¬† He gives Juarez tactical command and goes to help Naomi try to crack the door.¬† Juarez and Cass take careful shots with their limited ammunition as the assault team approaches, and Holden admires their bravery even as he admits to himself that Ashford is going to win.¬† And then the power comes back on, and the elevator starts up.¬† Naomi drops the elevator down to the floor and crushes the assault team.¬† Corin notices that the green light on the airlock is blinking, so she opens the door.¬† They enter the corridor and head towards the bridge.¬† They don‚Äôt really have the numbers to take the bridge, but they prepare to do it anyway.¬† Juarez is immediately shot when they begin their assault, so they all pull back around the corner.¬† Naomi works to bandage Juarez‚Äôs wounds, while the rest of the team shoots back at their attackers.¬† It looks like there‚Äôs no chance they can succeed.

**CHAPTER 51 - CLARISSA:**

Ashford wants to know why Clarissa let them in.¬† Cortez tries to defend her, saying she is in distress and misunderstood something he told her, but Ashford demands someone shoot Clarissa.¬† The gunfire from Holden‚Äôs team gives Clarissa and Cortez just enough time to duck into the safety of the security office.¬† They argue about whether the information Anna told her could be trusted, given that it was from James Holden.¬† Amazingly, Clarissa defends Holden, pointing out that he never lies.¬† She feels conflicted about the fact that she no longer wants Holden to die.¬† She has come to realize that everything she sacrificed was in vain, and she doesn‚Äôt think sacrificing her life now would make up for that.¬† Clarissa hears Ruiz tell Ashford that the laser is ready to fire, and she acts.¬† Activating her extra glands, she goes into [berserker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker) mode with her sights on Ashford.¬† Clarissa launches herself at him, knocking him away from the control panel so he can‚Äôt fire the laser.¬† She barely registers the firefight, just hoping she won‚Äôt be shot before she does everything she needs to do.¬† At the access panel, she finds the brownout buffer and pulls it, watching the cascade of failures with pleasure.¬† In her head, she tells Ren that he‚Äôs just helped her save everyone. She turns to see Ashford watching with rage, two of his men training their guns on her, and Cortez watching in surprise. ¬† Ashford pulls his pistol and aims it at her.¬† Cortez launches himself toward Ashford with a taser.¬† Then the lights flicker and go out.

**CHAPTER 52 - HOLDEN:**

The lights go out and Holden is thrown into complete disorientation.¬† All of a sudden, he is kneeling naked on a plain covered in moss and grass, with Miller standing a few feet away.¬† Miller explains it‚Äôs an Earth-like planet ‚Äúin the catalog‚Äù that he thought would be calming; they aren‚Äôt really there, but it‚Äôs a simulation in Holden‚Äôs brain where they can talk.¬† Miller tells him not to worry whether he‚Äôs still in the middle of a gunfight; he‚Äôs been able to convince the station that the humans are a curiosity, not a threat.¬† They‚Äôve gotten below the power threshold and saved Earth, among other things.¬† Miller shows Holden the sky filled with glowing blue Rings.¬† The gates open and Holden can see alien solar systems.¬† Miller explains that things look clear and there are no aliens invading Holden‚Äôs solar system, at least for now.¬† They can go through the gates, and Holden realizes he might be about to live through a golden age of exploration and expansion.¬† Miller cautions him not to get too excited because he should still be watching those [doors and corners](https://youtu.be/OxFuW6vhxlw?si=MF_VKzX9nZX3-Ypd&t=36).¬† The sky shifts again and Holden can see all the ships stuck in the slow zone.¬† Miller tells him that the speed limit and security system has been lifted, leaving the humans free to go home and also free to explore.¬† There are probably worlds like the one in this simulation, but Miller has another warning.¬† There was a war fought in the Ring, and the protomolecule side lost.¬† That civilization is gone, and Holden‚Äôs problem has been solved, but that‚Äôs not what Miller was made for.¬† The protomolecule built him to find out what happened to their civilization and fix it, and they were supposed to connect to the network, even though it‚Äôs not there.¬† And he‚Äôs not done with Holden; he needs a ride so he can keep investigating.¬† Holden is dropped back into the gunfight.¬† He turns on his suit lights and they hear Cortez yell for a cease-fire.¬† Holden tells Cortez that it‚Äôs all over, and Cortez says they should call Ruiz to turn everything back on so people don‚Äôt panic.¬† He also needs a medical team for Clarissa, who‚Äôs been shot by Ashford.¬†¬†

**CHAPTER 53 - CLARISSA:**

Clarissa slowly regains consciousness in a dirty room, hooked up to an IV, lying (not floating) in a bed because they‚Äôre under gravity.¬† She is satisfied to know that things worked out.¬† She exists in a strange mixture of sleep and waking, illness and healing.¬† When she wakes again, Holden and his crew are standing at her bedside with Anna, debating what to do with her.¬† Anna is asking for the *Rocinante* to transport Clarissa to Luna so she can stand trial and justice can be done, but Holden points out that she‚Äôs already tried to kill them once and so he won‚Äôt take her on his ship.¬† The rest of the crew has a different problem with the plan: they‚Äôre in a precarious legal position themselves since the *Roci*‚Äôs status is being contested.¬† Anna then offers to have Tilly buy the *Rocinante* from Mars so they can transport Clarissa.¬† Holden agrees.¬† Clarissa is outfitted with a medical restraint cuff that will knock her out instantly if she uses her glands or needs to be restrained by the crew.¬†¬†

Michio Pa has survived and is again captain of the *Behemoth*.¬† Funeral ceremonies are held for Bull, Sam, and a dozen others.¬† No one mentions Ashford at all.¬† The Martians are planning to stay in the Ring and survey the open gates.¬† Holden and his crew board the *Rocinante,* with Clarissa coming along but kept separate from the crew areas.¬† She knows they don‚Äôt want her there, and it weighs on her.¬† Everyone ignores her and she feels like she‚Äôs already disappeared from the world.¬† And then there‚Äôs a ***REAL*** crisis:¬† they are out of coffee!¬† This means that Holden will be forced to drink the fake coffee the ship makes, which gives him dead-squirrel-scented gas.¬† As the men tease each other about bodily functions, Naomi jokes to Clarissa that it‚Äôs nice to have another woman aboard, and this makes Clarissa tear up unexpectedly.¬†¬†

Fred Johnson is talking to Holden on a screen, expressing his regret over how much he asked of Bull and explaining that he intends to send supplies to the *Behemoth* so they can start farming on the drum.¬† He offers Holden a contract for the *Roci* to work as a security escort for the ships that will go between Ganymede and the Ring.¬† Holden notices Clarissa passing by and they greet each other, but she knows they‚Äôll never be friends because of the things she‚Äôs done that can never make up for.¬†¬†

Amos talks to Clarissa about the damage she did to the ship, and he shows some grudging respect for her strength.¬† As he works on the repairs, Clarissa thinks he looks like [Hephaestus](https://www.worldhistory.org/Hephaistos/), the smith of the Gods.¬† As they talk about the repairs, Clarissa is able to suggest a fix that Amos hadn‚Äôt tried.¬† She asks him if he thinks she‚Äôll be executed, and he tells her the UN doesn‚Äôt often apply the death penalty so she‚Äôll likely be living the rest of her life in a tiny cell.¬† Clarissa says she‚Äôll miss being on the *Roci*, and Amos just shrugs, but then he offers to reprogram her ankle monitor so she can help him in the machine shop with the repairs.¬† He calls her Peaches, and she tells him it feels good to be fixing something.¬†¬†

**EPILOGUE - ANNA:**

On the *Thomas Prince*, Anna sits in the observation lounge watching the display of the stars outside.¬† She records a message to her family explaining that she‚Äôs been summoned to a meeting with the conference bishop because people have complained about her actions during the crisis.¬† She suspects it is Ashford and isn‚Äôt concerned about how she‚Äôll respond.¬† She tells Nono that Tilly will be visiting Anna and her family in Moscow, where Nami is learning to crawl in full gravity, amazing Anna.¬† She tells her wife she has a lot to apologize for, but also feels like her presence made a difference in the outcome of everything that happened.¬† With an expression of love, she hugs a pillow in place of her family, and sends the message off.¬† Anna watches the ships going home through the Ring, returning with news of the open gates and of those who died.¬† Anna can only imagine the opportunities and resources that the opening of the Ring gates offers to children like Nami.¬† She is surprised when Cortez approaches her.¬† He tells Anna that the Secretary General of the UN has lost an election while they were gone and is being replaced by Nancy Gao, a move that he assumes was orchestrated by Chrisjen Avasarala.¬† Anna doesn‚Äôt know who that is, and thinks to herself that politics is almost the worst thing invented by people, except for [lutefisk](https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/food-and-drink/lutefisk/).¬† Then Cortez asks her not to hold it against him that he supported the wrong side in the conflict on the *Behemoth*.¬† She assures him that she won‚Äôt, and still considers him a good man.¬† Cortez wonders if it‚Äôs advisable to explore the new worlds instead of being satisfied with Earth.¬† Anna says she thinks that learning is never in opposition to God, because He‚Äôs bigger than all of it.¬† Cortez cautions her that by exploring, they are choosing that future for the next generation, no matter what it might bring.",1,1735400913.0,bookclub,20,1.0,False
1ho8apr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1ho8apr/what_to_do_about_jobs_if_your_grades_arent_ideal/,What To Do About Jobs If Your Grades Aren‚Äôt Ideal: Aggregated Advice For 1L‚Äôs From Reddit,"A lot of folks have been posting this question, ‚ÄúI got my grades back and they‚Äôre worse than I thought. What do I do now? Am I never getting a job?‚Äù

There‚Äôs a ton of good advice on this sub so I figured I‚Äôd aggregate some of the most helpful (tactically and emotionally) comments and posts into one super-post for any students out there feeling not so hot right now.¬†

I‚Äôd just like to add myself briefly: It‚Äôs okay. Really. 

It really does happen to the best of us. Law school is weird and sometimes it takes a while to get your sea legs. You‚Äôre not doomed yet. Plenty of folks (including [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1g8ui1j/i_broke_into_big_law_without_going_to_a_t14_and/)) were heartbroken after our first semester grades were released and still go on to have great jobs in all sorts of fields including big law, government, in-house, whatever. You‚Äôre not the only one, and while yes, some jobs can be an uphill battle and things will be hard, you‚Äôre not out of the game yet.¬†

So here we go. A list of some great advice I‚Äôve read from reddit on what to do if your grades were bleh and how to tackle the job hunt now.¬†

# Big Themes/TDLR:

1. **Network like a demon.** This is going to be your biggest lever you can pull until you get a new set of grades later. It will also be the thing that lets you punch above your grades to land things you might not have otherwise. 
2. **Apply to 1L jobs that might be less grade sensitive** (i.e. some state and local government jobs, some public interest, maybe some small firms if you want to work at a firm, etc.). And even if some places are grade sensitive, shoot your shot anyways. There‚Äôs no harm in trying. You never know unless you try, and plenty of people were picked up at spots they didn‚Äôt expect their grades to make the cut.¬†
3. **As awkward as it is, go talk to every single one of your professors and ask what happened.** Was it that you just outright didn‚Äôt know the material? You didn‚Äôt IRAC? Missed big issues? The test taking strategies they might be able to share with you will apply to future exams, even in entirely different subject areas. Then, go talk to your TAs if they‚Äôre open to it. Get a second look at those exams. Then do that again with legal tutors (many schools will automatically give you them if your grades are below a certain threshold, but if they don‚Äôt, ask for them anyways). You basically are looking for as many data points as possible to figure out what went wrong and how you can systematically improve next semester.

# Advice From Redditors

>**@**[**Laws\_of\_Coffee**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Laws_of_Coffee/)  
  
I got put on academic probation after 1L fall. I worked a judicial externship for the first summer. It was great. Second summer I worked a government honors law clerkship and am returning part time to them in the spring.  
  
You‚Äôre not outta the count. Work with your school. Figure out what went wrong on exams. Attend class. Take good notes. You‚Äôll perform and get outta the hole.  
  
A lot and I mean a LOT of the hiring process is personality. Be a good person and be kind and that energy will carry you far.



>@[**Psychological\_Snow27**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Psychological_Snow27/)  
  
I had a rough first semester and thought that my big law goals were shot out of the gate. But I took the opportunity to reassess my approach and work smarter in the following semesters and ended up having a successful recruiting experience for big law.   
  
I ended up getting a 1L big law summer position with what I think may have been the lowest GPA the firm had ever accepted from my school, then raised my grades substantially and had a lot of options for 2L summer. Now I‚Äôm about to enter a top firm in a top market.  
  
The feeling you‚Äôre experiencing isn‚Äôt a fun one, but you‚Äôre not at the end of the road. Just focus on improvement and start networking heavily.



>@[**bighairbigtex**](https://www.reddit.com/user/bighairbigtex/)  
  
How heavily your first semester grades are weighted depends on your goals. There are many traditionally competitive jobs (biglaw, clerkships) where first year grades are the most important year of grades. But plenty of other employers (like small firms, some public defender offices, local government) exist where grades aren‚Äôt as important, or where they might look at an upward trend as a sign of hard work.  
  
If you go to a school where people actually get C-range grades, the most grade sensitive employers were probably a long shot anyway (and now with a C, they are almost certainly off the table).  
  
So, you shouldn‚Äôt be looking at fed gov, fed clerk, or large/prestigious firms. But those are far from the only legal employers, and one C shouldn‚Äôt take you out of range for other kinds of jobs.



>**@**[**zarigueya4014**](https://www.reddit.com/user/zarigueya4014/)  
  
Tis not the end of the world. My first semester grades were a big shock too, they are for many. Take time to rest, lick your wounds, and then lock in when this new semester starts. That includes meeting with professors to review your exams and figure out where you went wrong. Was it a test taking issue? A study habit issue? A little of both? Something else? Professors are a great resource for answering this question. Otherwise, realize that a 2.7 is not the end of the world and you're still very likely on track to graduate and become a lawyer.   
  
Still apply to all the jobs that interest you, regardless of whether you think your GPA is too low. If a potential employer asks about your grades, be honest with them about what didn't go as planned this semester, and what you're actively doing to improve yourself. Employers, if they're human, realize that nobody is perfect and what matters a lot is how someone reacts to their own stumbles. You've got this! Don't let that imposter syndrome sink your dreams.



>**@**[**tenyeartreasurybill**](https://www.reddit.com/user/tenyeartreasurybill/)

>Apply everywhere. If you‚Äôre not picky about location look at firms that are not ‚Äúbiglaw‚Äù but carry similar early career earning potential like AmLaw 200 firms or Delaware local counsel shops.

>Apply to secondary market offices for V100 firms too, and of course don‚Äôt close any doors on yourself and apply to primary markets within the V100 too.

>Being above a 3.0 at a good school puts you above the grade cut-offs for a lot of places. Some firms won‚Äôt look below a 3.3/3.5 whatever but ‚Äúbiglaw‚Äù (or a biglaw salary at least) is definitely not out of the question.



>**@**[**IndividualBee8900**](https://www.reddit.com/user/IndividualBee8900/)

>My school doesn‚Äôt rank‚Äîwhich presents its own challenges, but suffice it to say it depends. The biggest thing with 1L is doing well. The assumption with any grade is you tried your hardest. I‚Äôm sorry you fell short of your expectations.

>Decide whether big law is the goal, the means to an end, or a way to make money during law school. If it‚Äôs option 1‚Äìand depending on your law school rank and geographic market‚Äîa 1L big firm job is probably not in the cards. For 2L it‚Äôs potential, but start applying and networking now. For ‚Äòlower‚Äô GPAs and big law, it might take till 3L. So think about what you can do during the summers and the school year.   
  
Look at an unconventional route that interests you. In my experience, lawyers care way more about how much work you are willing to do adequately than how much you can do excellently. Networking is key and people will admire a hardcore smiling grinder than a pompous intellectual. Here‚Äôs my story as an example. Caveat, I took two years of free jobs in two different countries, emailed literally every financial institution and law firm with a market cap over $500 million and every lawyer there who went to my school, and asked every professor if they had projects I could help with.

>I was a university athlete during 1L and 2L. I was a professional athlete 1L summer and worked for less than minimum wage at a PI firm. During 2L I studied abroad and took all financial regulatory and free speech classes and did financial litigation for free while maintaining my athletic status. During my 2L summer I wrote law articles with a professor at Cambridge, during the first semester 2L I wrote an article for a professor, second semester I wrote two for professors, 3L fall I wrote for another professor and now my 3L spring, I‚Äôm writing an article with a SCOTUS justice and another professor. I was on a journal but it wasn‚Äôt law review. My Cambridge articles were published in my schools law review, one was published with The Hague commission on war crimes, and the final ones are with the Court. 3L I took a free job working for an investment bank reviewing contracts and helped coach my university sports team. I finally landed a big law job slightly before finals.

>I went to every non-school networking event I could find, failed a ton at making connections and slowly got better. I was called stupid a third of the time during networking calls and learned when some things were worth more time than others.

>Keep this in mind, no one wants to see you fail, everyone will help, no one can help you as much as you can. Take advice with a grain of salt, but don‚Äôt write it off. You don‚Äôt want to go into interviews or networks trying to impress people, go in honestly telling them what you want, something that interests them, and find out about them. Follow-up like crazy cause no one does. As a 24 year old 2L I spoke to people that my professors have been how TF did you meet that person, as a second semester 3L, I‚Äôm polite and helpful and just willing to work. That is what got me my job with a slightly above curve gpa when I was under the curve for three semesters.

>Finally, experienced, high-ranking lawyers want mentees. I know three general councils for the three biggest US banks in the world‚Äîpurely out of networking, no family ties or even my law school network. One GC told me that he‚Äôd rather have a young lawyer from Fordham who works than a Harvard grad who is just smart.



>**@**[**Expensive\_Change\_443**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Expensive_Change_443/)

>Not to be a Debbie downer, so let me start out with nothing is actually impossible. But that being said, you have an uphill battle. The chances of, in one semester, going from below the average to high enough for an OCI SA candidate GPA range is slim to none. Keep in mind that the very top of your class likely was all As, and will likely be there or pretty damn close again. So just doing the math, you shifting from B50 to T10-25% in one more semester isn‚Äôt very likely. So my advice would be twofold.   
  
First, do something meaningful with your 1L summer that helps your non-GPA credentials for OCI. If you qualify, look into the 1L diversity clerkships some big law firms offer. Look into nonprofit fellowships or split fellowships sponsored by big law firms. Look into other prestigious, but less competitive opportunities. A lot of government agencies ‚Äúhire‚Äù volunteer legal interns. These are still tough to get and prestigious, but may not be advertised as widely or as competitive as OCI or paid 2L government internships, especially outside of the DoJ. Seconds, without giving up entirely, it may be time to start thinking outside BL, at least as a 2L/post grad option.   
  
Think about a) what else you might be interested in, and b) how important big law vs. a particular practice area within it is. There are some back door ways into ‚Äúnon-partner track‚Äù staff attorney position laterals that have similar compensation to associate positions without the pressure/competition. Particularly, from what I have heard, business based immigration, taxes, and estates tend to be ‚Äúspecialty groups‚Äù within a lot of big firms that don‚Äôt hire attorneys through the traditional OCI track.   
  
Consider going to a boutique or mid size firm in one of those practice areas to set yourself up for an early career lateral. Also, even if your grades don‚Äôt go up dramatically, if you are set on big law, apply through OCI. Some career service folks and big law hiring folks discourage it and say it shows a lack of ability/willingness to follow directions. I have also heard others describe it as a sign of ambition and confidence and willingness to try difficult things. The worst that will happen is you won‚Äôt get an interview or won‚Äôt get hired (which will also happen if you don‚Äôt apply).



>**@**[**Distinct\_Number\_3658**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Distinct_Number_3658/)

>Network! Network! Network!!! I got my 1L summer clerk position by cold emailing alumni. Most alumni I emailed didn‚Äôt even respond. It‚Äôs a numbers game. One alumni I emailed happened to be the managing partner of a boutique law firm. I emailed asking to connect on how to transition into the legal field from XYZ law school. I never even spoke directly about a job, and out of the blue during finals week she sent me an email asking if I would clerk for her. I was (kinda) offered a post-grad position last week, and continue to work throughout the school year.

>My 1L grades were bad. (2.4 first semester on a 3.0 curve, and had to retake civ pro due to getting under a C) The attorney who ended up hiring me never even asked about grades or my transcript.

>Have you ever heard lawyers say, if the facts are on your side you argue the facts, but if the law is on your side, you argue the law? There‚Äôs a similar principle here in my opinion. If your grades are good, lead with your transcript. If they aren‚Äôt, lead with your personality and desire to add value. Sell yourself. You, yes you, can and will do this!



>**@**[**haysfan**](https://www.reddit.com/user/haysfan/)

>Hang in there. Two critical things to remember:

>Learn from your mistakes. Meet with each professor. Identify what specifically prevented you from earning a higher grade. Figure out if those things are attributable to gaps in knowledge, study methods, or something else. Adjust accordingly.

>Your law school career is not over. Make some adjustments, pull your GPA up. That will make you a more competitive job applicant. While a bad first semester may disqualify you from some things, it won‚Äôt disqualify you from everything. Focus on pulling your GPA up and you‚Äôll have a great career. 



>**@**[**nuggetofpoop**](https://www.reddit.com/user/nuggetofpoop/)   
  
Many employers don't ask about grades. Don't worry about it too much. Focus on improving your studies. If you can't find a 1L summer gig, see if you can RA, take classes, do clinic, or find some law-related volunteer work.



>**@**[**jce8491**](https://www.reddit.com/user/jce8491/)

>It happens. Keep working hard. Some people are better at law school tests than others. My personal view (everybody has their own opinion) is that supplements aren't useful. Your professor is going to teach the class in the way that matters to them. They're grading your exam, so you need to learn from them and rely on what they say.

>The other thing I'll say is that taking practice tests is very important. Get your outlines done and then immediately go to practice tests (in the period leading up to the exam). Understanding how to apply what you know is more important than rote memorization (particularly in classes where you can use an outline). I'd recommend going to your professors and reviewing the exams. It might be painful, but you learn the most from your mistakes.

>As for 1L summer employment, just don't put your GPA on your resume. There are jobs that will take you, particularly unpaid internships. Get out there and network.



>**@**[**Fuzzy\_Purple\_Llama**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fuzzy_Purple_Llama/)

>I failed a class 1L year 2nd semester, and the rest of my grades were either a C or C+.

>I'm now in my last semester and have my post-grad job lined up.

>I had a clerk position the summer after 1L. The summer after 2L, I had two clerk positions. One of which extended into last semester. This semester, I'm working at the firm that will be my post-grad associate attorney job.

>So... take a little time to be angry and sad. Then suck it up and handle your business. Also, think outside the box when looking for jobs. Don't rely on your school's job bank...whete a lot of other students from your school AND OTHERS are competing for a very limited number of spots.



And lastly, on a nice note.



>**@**[**quailsdontquack**](https://www.reddit.com/user/quailsdontquack/)

>Stick with it‚Äî 1L fall is about learning how to learn. Have faith that you‚Äôll do better in the spring.



>**@**[**ErinGoBoo**](https://www.reddit.com/user/ErinGoBoo/)

>Also, stop telling yourself you can't do it. My first semester was an absolute dumpster fire... and when I say it was a dumpster fire I mean I was a solid C student brought down by a D+. I did worse my second semester. I have managed to make a complete turnaround, and while I can't say I'm now getting straight As and am top of my class, I can tell you I'm still here, I'm more confident, and I feel like I actually belong now. I have stopped telling myself I don't belong here and the school made a terrible mistake taking me in. I have stopped deciding what my bad class is going to be every term. I have decided I am going to graduate from law school. This is all stuff I didn't do through my 1L year. You are your own worst enemy, so stop it. You can do this.

1ho8682,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1ho8682/hi_there_fellow_stopgamers/,Hi there fellow /stopgamers,"I have been grappling with my gaming addiction for a while now.  
At first I was not taking it all to serious. I had another addicion to battle first which was alcohol.  
I am sober from that for 17 months now.  I am also a massive coffeeholic. I played World of Warcraft alot after the launch of Classic Wow but after the first expansion TBC I lost motivation. The game which really gets me the dopamine rush at full force is Starcraft 2 (combined with a truckload of coffee).  
  
I tried to quit both coffee and Starcraft 2 endless of times. Telling myself, this is my last evening with coffee and SC2 so now I can binge game and drink ... then a few days later I reinstall SC2 (which is so easy and fast that uninstalling is pointless and only to make me feel better at that time). I have been reading here and on /decaf alot and I know for sure now that I can't control my gaming and coffee intake.   
  
So I just want to shout it out loud here. I have failed so many times but I have never gave up the desire to quit. I hope this post will create some extra accountabilty  for me. I will come back here to give some updates on my /nogaming (and no coffee) journey. If you have tips, or just want to share your experience, please leave a comment. I hope more people will join me on the /nogaming journey. Life is short and my love for gaming has transformed in endless grinds and countless hours of siting behind my PC. This is not how I want to go forward. I will turn 40 next year. I unsubbed my wow account and resubbed my gym account. It's time to get in shape and level up in real life now!

One more thing. I like to watch streamers on youtube who play Starcraft. I don't watch that excessive, it's also not getting me stressed or wired like playing myself. I wonder if I should keep watching those or that it's better to stay away from that to?

Good luck all and thanks for reading.",1,1735400475.0,StopGaming,0,1.0,False

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interest you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1ho82ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1ho82ht/start_with_live_improvisation/,Start with live improvisation,"Hi! I would like to try making electronic music. There are many suggestions in this sub, but most of them seem to aim for editing songs similar to video editing, where you build a song step by step and refine it in multiple iterations to work towards a final result.

I would mostly like to improvise live for myself. I learned the piano as a kid and when I visit my parents, I like to improvise on their electric piano. Not really writing anything down, just playing for myself because I enjoy the process. I would love to do something similar at home, but more electronic than piano and on a small budget to try things out. I also have very little space, so equipment needs to be somewhat compact and easily storable.

I was thinking about a cheap/used midi keyboard and cheap/free software. I think I would mostly do this on a MacBook, but I also have a Windows machine available. Something like 100‚Ç¨ total for a start. As I said, I learned the piano, so a piano-style keyboard is a must.

Some ideas of what kind of music I have in mind:

1. Ambient sounds, basically just chords of deep electronic sounds.

Examples:
Brendon Moeller - Soaring
Alessandro Cortini - III

2. Piano improvisation over a beat.

Examples: 
&ME, Black Coffee, Keinemusik - The Rapture Pt.III

3. Progressive styles of Techno and House that are based on progressively adding and removing more and more elements.

Examples:
Einmusik - Sirens
Stephan Bodzin - Birth

I'm looking for equipment, software and workflow recommendations. Thanks!",0,1735400178.0,edmproduction,2,0.5,False
1ho82bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/uber/comments/1ho82bt/feedback_and_query_regarding_an_uber_baxi_ride_in/,Feedback and Query Regarding an Uber Baxi Ride in Delhi,"I wanted to share an unusual experience I recently had during an Uber Baxi ride and seek your input on whether this is a common occurrence.

Ride Details:

Pickup Location: Karol Bagh, Delhi, India

Destination: Kashmiri Gate Metro Station.

Driver‚Äôs Name: Sonu Rawat.


The driver took over 10 minutes to arrive at a location just 740 meters away. Since I was having coffee at the time, I didn‚Äôt mind the delay.

However, during the ride, the driver informed me that he needed to pick up a parcel. Trusting his judgment, I agreed. He stopped at KFC, collected an order, and then mentioned he needed to deliver it to a nearby location before continuing our journey. While I appreciated his politeness and effort, this added an unexpected delay to my trip.

To make matters more confusing, I was dropped off at Sarai Rohilla Railway Station instead of my intended destination. The driver briefly left, asking me to wait. After around five minutes and a follow-up call, he returned and completed the trip to Kashmiri Gate Metro Station.

It was evident that the driver was simultaneously working with Uber as well as other platforms, such as food delivery services, during this trip. Some people might suggest that I should have canceled the ride, but I was in a location where finding alternate transportation was not easy. Canceling would have left me stranded and caused further inconvenience.

Is this kind of situation common? Has anyone else faced similar issues?",1,1735400164.0,uber,0,0.99,False

1ho81s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1ho81s4/general_musings/,General musings,"So I‚Äôm coming to the end of week 4 (2.5) and my first 5mg dose is tomorrow. So far I‚Äôve seen good results and I‚Äôm down almost 6kg as of last Sunday. 

My husband has been incredibly supportive but he doesn‚Äôt really understand my journey (my husband has always been ‚Äúthe low end of average‚Äù in his weight) so I wanted to put some general musings out into the mounjaro community void. If anyone has any comments or advice I‚Äôm always happy to hear them. 

Water- before mounjaro I always drank 40-80 oz of water a day (yes I have a massive meoky tumbler that is glued to me at all times), but since starting I‚Äôve shifted to 80-100oz and pee a lot less than I used to! Part of this increase was worry over constipation and dehydration (both of which I‚Äôve avoided so far- touch wood!) and part of it is just increased thirst. I‚Äôve also started taking electrolyte tablets in my water on a morning which I find gives me a boost. 

Protein- so I‚Äôm still struggling on the protein front a bit. I‚Äôm trying to be protein- forward but could definitely do with getting more in. Due to allergies I cannot eat meat, but I do occasionally eat fish, putting me in the pescatarian box, but I prefer to eat vegetarian most of the time. Eggs and Jacob‚Äôs protein bread have been my saviour for breakfasts and lunch, with protein powder added into coffees and clear whey protein filling my tumbler in a morning. If I‚Äôm missing any obvious tricks to get more (vegetarian) protein in my diet,please share!

Supplements-I know this is a hot topic with a lot of people saying you need X Y and Z to succeed on mounjaro, and some people saying it‚Äôs all a scam. Personally I take a multivitamin and vitamin D each day as this was recommended by my doctor. I also take a vegan‚Äúhair skin and nail‚Äù gummy on the daily with plans to swap to a vegan based
Collagen when I‚Äôve finished my current tub, this is mainly to help with my brittle nails but also to help with minimising lose skin in the long run. 

Exercise- due to a multitude of reasons, not limited to disability, I have not exercised much. I‚Äôm planning on doing some home workouts to build strength and aid in fat loss when I feel like my body is capable. If anyone has any recommendations that don‚Äôt involve running or getting up and down from the floor constantly I would love to hear them!

‚ÄúSlow‚Äù losses- in 4 weeks I am about 6kg down, roughly 11lbs and almost a stone. For some that‚Äôs a slow loss but for me it‚Äôs monumental, the last time I lost that much weight I was in Slimming World and it dis more harm than good (for me personally). I‚Äôm hoping to stay consistent with these losses moving up to 5mg. 

Side effects- so far my side effects have been minimal and I hope it stays like this, but with moving up to 5mg I‚Äôm nervous as this seems to be a problem dose for a lot of people. My main side effect has been the last 2 days about an hour after waking up. I‚Äôm hungry. Not just a little bit or a regular amount which I‚Äôd expect, but I am so hungry my stomach cramps and it causes me to throw up. I‚Äôm aiming to treat this with a snack before bed about 9pm and see if it continues towards the end of the week on a higher dose, if so I‚Äôll speak to my gp. Aside from that I have had a minor bruise on my injection site one time, slight constipation for one day, reduced peeing and light nausea if I eat too much or too fast. 

If you made it this far, thanks for sticking with me whilst I rambled, I hope you all had a great festive period and I wish you the best for 2025!",1,1735400119.0,mounjarouk,2,1.0,False

It's only been about 2.5 weeks of coffee only. I'll only have 3 cups of coffee per day max.  But usually I'm good with just one before exercise. 

I suppose this reduction in caffeine consumption makes sense that I would experience strength gains, being as our nervous system runs on electricity and is stimulated by caffeine. I can only imagine that the cortisol which is released with excessive training would cause muscle breakdown and in the end reduce strength gains.

When you‚Äôre in your late 20s (29 to be exact), your whole mindset just changes. There‚Äôs this ‚Äúswitch‚Äù that just flips and all of a sudden your priorities are different. No longer do I care about owning the newest and latest and greatest. Not that I ever did, really. I don‚Äôt care about going out every weekend, drinking with friends, staying out late. Again, not that I ever really did. But I used to have this ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so young, live it up,‚Äù mentality. Weekends used to give me so much anxiety if I wasn‚Äôt doing the most. And maybe that‚Äôs what work does to you. Working all week and then maximizing the amount of time you have off. And I still have that. Expect, the switch got flipped. And now I think about how to make my house more of a home. Are the dishes done? What‚Äôs in the fridge? What‚Äôs for dinner? What‚Äôs the state of the laundry situation? What family can we see this weekend? We‚Äôve been married for over a month, now. And while it has changed some things.. others, it hasn‚Äôt. But I feel like my single friends think it has. They don‚Äôt reach out anymore. And when I do, they have plans. Plans that don‚Äôt usually include me. I will often get a half-ass invite, but they fully know the invitation is an obstacle to me and I‚Äôm likely not to take them up on it.

You wanna get together today?‚Äù All met with other plans already made. I feel like I even carefully curated the times in which I asked, to give her minimal time to make plans in between. But alas, to no avail. Is that the saying? Anyways, these early married days are just different. And kind of lonely. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I felt this way in my engagement, too. Don‚Äôt even get me started on that. I won‚Äôt back log that unless you ask. But as much as I love being a wife, I get it. I have another newly married friend who really seems to get it. I find some comfort in her, but recently she quit her job and I don‚Äôt see her as much now. I was really sad about that. Back to the ‚Äúswitch‚Äù. Your brain truly does shift focus. I‚Äôm thinking about babies, now. And if my house is enough. Things my husband and I can do together. How to be a better wife. How to fulfill my needs and grow how I‚Äôd like to.

I contacted customer support, and they suggested I might be using too much powder. The recommended serving is one scoop (or 8 oz of powder) in 250 mL of water.

I don't really feel any difference yet, likely due to the headache from yesterday's batch. I'll try again tomorrow morning and give you an update.

The wait wasn't long for me at all because I signed up on the bravo app before making the trip there, but others told me they had to wait 2 hours to get a seat.  

The casino itself is nice. But everywhere is going to smell like smoke including the poker room. You get free non alcoholic drinks (water, coffee, soda).  The poker room was a shit show as others described with how busy it was, but it didn't really impact the speed of the game.  Everyone i was playing with seemed to know the rules and when it's their turn, etc.

The size of the poker room is good, but I feel a couple of tables are too close to each other.  I've seen many complaints about the dealers online before going, and they weren't as bad as people were making them out to be in terms of speed of the game.  There was an occasional misdeal here and there with a card accidently getting flipped over when dealing, but when you're going that fast it's bound to happen at some point.  Cards were dealt very quick most of time.  I will say they aren't the most friendly people in the world.  Maybe it had something to do with it being busy idk, but the first 2 females I dealt with weren't friendly, especially the eastern european one lol.  Seemed liked the male dealers were more nice.  

As far as the rake goes, I don't think I even saw rake being taken out??? Anyone else that's played there notice that or is that just me?  Idk.  

There's definitely a lot of action.  Very loose players.  You could even say fishy for some, but the game is so fast paced it's hard to recognize them right away especially it being my first time playing at a casino, it was a little nervousing at first.  There 9 people at a table.  Not much talk with each other, just business.  Out of all the players there, I don't think I saw one female lol.  Predominantly middle aged men, some younger men.  

I had a decent experience there.  I played for about 3 hours and profited $350 for my first time playing at a casino.  Not bad right? Better than losing money

I have never seen him make a bad throw. What a future he has!"" -- Duke Snider 
 
Last April, I wrote about which Yankee player had the most vowels in his baseball-reference listed first and last names, thinking it was Jonathan Albaladejo with eight. The aptly named /u/M_Looka looked a little harder than me and found a Yankee with nine -- [Aurelio Rodriguez](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/trsAAOSwpKFlDf3k/s-l400.jpg)! 
 
Rodriguez was an extraordinary defensive third baseman who needed to be, because his bat was so weak. And yet he had some big hits for the Yankees in the World Series, and was the rare calming influence in the tumultuous New York clubhouse of the early 1980s. 
 
Happy birthday to [Aurelio Ituarte Rodriguez](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rodriau01.shtml), born December 28, 1947, in Cananea, Sonora, Mexico, a mining town near the border with Arizona. His father, Aurelio Rodriguez Sr., played in the Mexican League. 
 
At age 18, Rodriguez was the Rookie of the Year in the Mexican League as the starting shortstop for the Charros de Jalisco. In August of that year, he signed with the California Angels, who assigned him to Triple-A Seattle in the Pacific Coast League. He got there in time to play 17 games in September 1967, hitting .254. 
 
But the Angels already had a young star at shortstop -- Jim Fregosi! The future long-time manager was in 1967 a 25-year-old shortstop hitting .290/.349/.395 (125 OPS+) and winning the Gold Glove. And so the Angels moved Rodriguez to third base and assigned him to Double-A El Paso. There he hit .327/.364/.557 in 309 at-bats, so they promoted him back to Seattle, where he hit .308/.330/.405 in 185. 
 
He finished the 1967 season as a 19-year-old September call-up with the Angels. He hit just .238/.250/.300 in 130 at-bats, but his glove was so good that he quickly took over the starting third base job from veteran Paul Schaal. 
 
Rodriguez appeared poised to continue as the starter in 1968, but after a terrible spring training he was given a bench role. After getting just 13 plate appearances in all of April, the Angels gave the job back to Schaal and sent Rodriguez back to Seattle, where he hit an uninspiring .249/.280/.343 in 181 at-bats. 
 
But Schaal was beaned by Jose Santiago of the Red Sox on June 13, and missed almost the rest of the season. The Angels called Rodriguez back up, but he continued to struggle at the plate, hitting just .137 in June and then .222 over the first half of July. Aurelio was benched for two games to clear his head. When he got back, he hit .288/.340/.345 over the rest of the season, despite missing most of August after an emergency appendectomy. 
 
He played in almost every game as the starting third baseman in 1969, but hit just .232/.272/.307. He still played great defense, leading all third basemen with an amazing 42 double plays turned and ranking second behind the great Brooks Robinson with 352 assists, but also led the A.L. with 24 errors. 
 
Despite the errors, the press raved about his glove, and in particular his cannon arm. Yet he frequently came up in trade talks as the Angels were looking for more offense. They finally pulled the trigger on April 27, 1970, sending Aurelio and outfielder Rick Reichardt to the Washington Senators for veteran Ken McMullen. (These were not the original Washington Senators -- they had moved in 1961 to become the Minnesota Twins -- but the 1961 expansion team that would later become the Texas Rangers.) 
 
The reason the Angels finally gave up on Rodriguez as a hitter was because, they said, he was uncoachable. They wanted him to choke up and slap the ball the other way; he liked trying to hit the ball up the middle or pulling it down the line. The Senators figured if anyone could teach Rodriguez to hit, it was their manager -- the great Ted Williams. 
 
But Williams thought Rodriguez's approach was just fine -- the problem he saw was a lack of focus as games went on. The statistics don't really bear it out -- for his career, Rodriguez hit .230 in innings 1-3, .240 in innings 4-6, and .243 in innings 7-9 -- but whatever it was, Rodriguez blossomed under Williams. He had a career year, hitting .247/.300/.426 (103 OPS+) with 19 home runs in 547 at-bats, more than twice as many home runs as he had had in 977 at-bats with the Angels. He led the team with 5.6 bWAR! 
 
Now he was not just one of the league's best defensive third baseman, but a solid hitter as well, and he was still just 22 years old. His trade value at an all-time high, the Senators packaged Rodriguez with three other players in a eight-player swap with the Detroit Tigers, getting back future Yankee Elliott Maddox, third baseman Don Wert, prospect Norm McRae, and the headliner, former two-time Cy Young Award winner Denny McLain. McLain had been suspended for three separate incidents during the 1970 season, but hopes were high that the 26-year-old McLain would straighten out and regain his dominance under Williams. Instead he led the majors with 22 losses and posted a 4.28 ERA (77 ERA+). Prior to the start of the 1972 season, the Senators moved to Texas but didn't bring McLain with them, dealing him to Oakland for a couple of no-name pitchers. 
 
Meanwhile, Rodriguez -- called ""the prize of the deal"" from Detroit's point of view -- saw his batting stats fade considerably from what he'd done in Washington, though he still showed more power than he had with the Angels. In nine years with Detroit, he hit .239/.274/.356 (76 OPS+). The Tigers won the A.L. East in his second year with them, but lost to the Oakland A's in the ALCS, three games to two. (Aurelio went 0-for-16 in the series.) 
 
In 1976, he hit just .240/.267/.325 (71 OPS+), but he made up for it with the leather, winning a Gold Glove in 1976 and snapping Brooks Robinson's streak of 16 straight GG's at third base. (Graig Nettles of the Yankees then won it in 1977 and 1978.) Robinson said Rodriguez was as good a defensive player as he was, praise he never gave to Nettles. 
 
But while his defense was still great, Rodriguez's ever-weakening bat was becoming a problem. In 1977 he was reduced to a platoon player and defensive replacement. After the 1979 season, the 31-year-old Rodriguez's contract was sold to the Padres. 
 
There he hit just .200/.227/.297, continuing in mostly a platoon and defensive replacement role. But then some bad luck for the Yankees was good luck for Rodriguez. In late July of 1980, Graig Nettles got sick -- the Yankees at first thought it was the flu, then the diagnosis was hepatitis -- and he missed all of August and September, only returning for the final two games of the season. DH Eric Soderholm was moved to third base, and the Yankees bought Rodriguez's contract from the Padres to be his back up and defensive replacement. After a week, Rodriguez took over the starting role, playing almost every game the rest of the season. As had happened in Anaheim and in Detroit, he won the job not because of his bat -- he hit .220/.251/.323 line in 182 plate appearances -- but his glove. 
 
> ""The depth of the Yankees' pitching has been suspect all season, and when third baseman Graig Nettles was lost with hepatitis, Steinbrenner subscribed to the theory many baseball people mistakenly reverse -- that you don't support mediocre pitching with more firepower, you do it with defense. Hence, the slick-fielding Rodriguez."" -- Peter Gammons 
 
But he did provide some unlikely offense, such as his walk-off two-run home run off Chicago's Britt Burns on [August 11](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA198008110.shtml), and his two-run home run off Dennis Eckersley -- then a starter -- in the sixth inning of a 5-3 win at Fenway on [September 14](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS198009140.shtml). 
 
The Bronx Bombers returned to the postseason in 1980 but were swept by the Royals in three games; Rodriguez appeared in two games and went 2-for-6 with a double. 
 
Rodriguez was back with the Yankees in 1981, but so was a healthy Nettles. Rodriguez rarely played, only when Nettles needed a rest or a day off against a tough lefty. Aurelio didn't get a plate appearance in April; 18 plate appearances in May; 12 in June; none in July; 12 in August; and 13 in September. He saw a little time at first and second in addition to third, and even had seven at-bats as a DH (and had three hits and an RBI!). 
 
I mentioned Rodriguez didn't get a plate appearance in April -- but his bat did! On [April 27](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET198104270.shtml), in a game against the Tigers, Bucky Dent was hitting just .192. In the seventh, with the Yankees clinging to a 1-0 lead, Nettles told Dent to try a lighter bat. He borrowed Rodriguez's 31-ouncer and hit a two-run home run to give New York a little breathing room, and the Yankees hung on to win, 3-1. 
 
In October, Rodriguez didn't play in the three games to two win over the Brewers in the ALDS, and only appeared in the Game 2 blowout in the three-game sweep of the Oakland A's. But in the World Series, Nettles jammed his thumb diving for a ball in Game 2, and didn't play again until the final game. Rodriguez more than capably filled in for him, going 5-for-12 with a walk and not making an error, but the Yankees lost in six games. 
 
Overall, in seven games as a Yankee in the post-season, the light-hitting Rodriguez was an impressive .389/.421/.444 (.866 OPS) hitter! 
 
After the 1981 World Series, the Blue Jays came calling, asking the Yankees for Rodriguez. Toronto needed a third baseman because their starting third baseman in 1981, Danny Ainge, had unexpectedly quit baseball to play pro basketball! Having played in the majors for three seasons, the former BYU shooting guard made himself available for the 1981 NBA draft, which was held three days prior to the start of the 1981 MLB players' strike. The Celtics took him in the second round (\#31 overall) and then worked out a cash settlement with the Blue Jays. 
 
The Yankees were willing to deal Rodriguez because they wanted to give the utility infielder role to Tucker Ashford, the \#2 overall pick by the San Diego Padres in the 1974 January amateur draft. Ashford, now 27, had hit .300/.380/.496 in 504 at-bats in Triple-A in 1981 and it looked like he'd finally get a shot at a major league job. 
 
And so the Yankees sent Rodriguez to the Blue Jays for a Player To Be Named Later, who turned out to be the \#1 overall pick in the 1978 January draft -- 22-year-old catcher Mike Lebo. (He would hit an impressive .298/.387/.573 in A-ball for the Yankees that year, but apparently never played professionally again -- anyone know why? -- and then became a long-time youth coach.) 
 
The trade was a bust for the Blue Jays as well. He never played in the majors for the Blue Jays after being beaten out in spring training by prospect Garth Iorg -- plucked from the Yankee farm system by the Blue Jays in the 1976 expansion draft -- and they flipped Rodriguez to the White Sox for veteran DH Wayne Nordhagen. 
 
Rodriguez hit .241/.275/.342 in 277 plate appearances in 1982 as Chicago's third baseman. After the season, Rodriguez signed as a free agent with the Orioles. He hit just .119 in 71 plate appearances and was released, and returned to the White Sox where he went 4-for-20 over the final month of the season. His final major league appearance was as a defensive replacement in Game 3 of the 1983 ALCS as the White Sox fell to the Orioles, 11-1. 
 
His major league career was over, but he hung on for a few more years in the Mexican League, then was a manager there, winning the Mexican League championship in 1991 with Monterrey. In 1995, he was elected to the [Sal√≥n de la Fama del Beisbol Mexicano](https://en.salondelafamadelbeisbolmexicano.com/). 
 
On September 23, 2000, the 52-year-old Rodriguez returned to Detroit for a fan event. Rodriguez was leaving a restaurant at around 2 o'clock in the afternoon when the driver of a passing car had a stroke and swerved onto the sidewalk, drove over Rodriguez, and into a tree. His funeral in Mexico was attended by thousands, including Mexico's president. 
 
At the time of his death, Rodriguez was a minor league instructor for the Arizona Diamondbacks. They have, or had, an award named in his honor. The Aurelio Rodriguez Award recognizes ""the Diamondbacks minor league player who best exemplifies character on and off the field, who is a good teammate and who comes to the ballpark every day ready to play."" I can't find a list of who has won it every year, or when it started or if it is still going on, but there are stories about [outfielder Adam Eaton winning it in 2011](https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/sports/high-school/grad-eaton-honored-diamondbacks/mWpoADjg8CVt1bpNOSTSLP/) and [Socrates Brito winning it in 2015](https://www.mlb.com/es/player/socrates-brito-593647). 
 
**Oh Really Oh!** 
 
* The name Aurelio has a Latin origin, from the root word aurum, meaning ""golden"" or ""gilded."" In Ancient Rome, it was written as Aurelius -- most famously, Emperor Marcus Aurelius. 
 
* There have only been four major leaguers with the first name Aurelio. The first was Aurelio Cortes, a Cuban-born catcher who played in the Negro Leagues in the late 1920s. The other two had overlapping careers with Rodriguez: Aurelio Monteagudo, a pitcher from 1963 to 1973, and Aurelio Lopez, a pitcher from 1974 to 1987. Aurelio Rodriguez was right in between, 1967 to 1983. And all three -- Monteagudo, Rodriguez, and Lopez -- [died in car accidents](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/mlb-players-named-aurelio-died-the-same-way/wjxlg181u6c71w1uk56r9c9b8)! 
 
* Rodriguez's nickname is sometimes given as ""Chi-Chi,"" though it doesn't appear he was often called that. It likely comes from having the same last name as Puerto Rican golfer Chi-Chi Rodriguez, who became a national celebrity in 1964 after beating Arnold Palmer by one stroke to win the Western Open. 
 
* If Rodriguez played today, his nickname would probably be ""Au-Rod."" 
 
*  ""Aurelio Rodriguez might be the best Mexican player ever,"" Angels manager Bill Rigney said prior to the 1969 season. (Though he did qualify that statement by also mentioning 1950s Cleveland Indians infielder Bobby Avila.) Was he right? Kind of, at least when he said it! Rodriguez's 15.11 career bWAR was the second-best by a Mexican-born player (behind Avila, 28.43 bWAR) until Fernando Valenzuela came along in 1980 (41.45 bWAR). Aurelio now ranks ninth, behind Valenzuela, Teddy Higuera (30.34), Avila, Ismael Valdez (24.13), Esteban Loaiza (22.74), Yovani Gallardo (22.31), Vinny Castilla (19.32), and Joakim Soria (18.60). 
 
* When we remembered [previously forgotten Yankee Alfredo Aceves](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/uiwrlx/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/), I noted Aceves (2.7 bWAR) is the greatest Mexican-born Yankee of all time, if you go by bWAR accumulated as a Yankee. Rodriguez (-0.3 bWAR) ranked 12th. 
 
* When Dodgers rookie Fernando Valenzuela was taking baseball by storm in 1981, sportswriter Dick Young asked Rodriguez about him. (They were both from Sonora.) ""He was good, but not outstanding,"" Rodriguez said. What limited statistics are available from Valenzuela's early days in the Mexican Center League show Rodriguez's scouting report was apt. But then Valenzuela learned the screwball from Dodgers reliever Bobby Castillo, and ""Fernandomania"" was born. 
 
* Rodriguez was a popular teammate. ""He was a very personable kind of guy,"" legendary Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell said. ""He had a great smile. He was the kind of person everyone took to."" When the Yankees traded for Rodriguez in 1980, his good-natured personality was deemed almost as important as his glove, as the Yankee clubhouse in those days was positively toxic. 
 
* [Rodriguez's 1969 baseball card](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91iALLdbToL.jpg) is a popular one with collectors -- that's not him on the card! It's Leonard Garcia, the Angels bat boy. To this day, no one is sure if someone had pulled a prank on the Topps photographer or if it was just a mistake. Apparently no one noticed for awhile, and you can see why from the baby-faced Rodriguez's [1970 card](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KC5fxa8xL.jpg). But there was no mistaking Rodriguez for a bat boy once he [grew his awesome 'stache](https://ansel.frgimages.com/detroit-tigers/aurelio-rodriguez-autographed-baseball-card-detroit-tigers-1981-detroit-news-number-47_ss2_p-200648864+u-zamuweiwqizymeualwfe+v-ujkzwbptzklmctwcyqns.jpg).
 
* Rodriguez's [1983 Fleer card](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xUsJmKmSL._UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg) is a fun one too. He was goofing around with the photographer and they picked it for the card. Trying to stand out from Topps's sometimes staid approach, [Fleer](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/yxUAAOSwQj1mtmfs/s-l400.png) [cards](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/gwYAAOSw3ppgQa1X/s-l400.jpg) [were](https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1984-Fleer-Baseball-Glenn-Hubbard.jpg) [often](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/onsAAOSwqGJh~~ef/s-l1200.jpg) [more](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/t5YAAOSwM4tiABzq/s-l400.jpg) [unusual](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/wVUAAOSwJo9k0tCy/s-l400.png). 
 
* When Rodriguez was first signed by the Los Angeles Angels, they assigned him to their Triple-A affiliate in Seattle. At the time, he spoke almost no English, and he encountered few Spanish speakers in Seattle. He said he knew how to order only one thing in restaurants: Ham and eggs. ""Breakfast, lunch, and dinner,"" Rodriguez later said. ""I ate so many eggs, I was beginning to feel like a chicken."" If the waitress asked how he wanted the eggs, he would just shrug, leaving it up to the cook. ""I had them every way -- scrambled, poached, and fried."" 
 
* Aurelio found more Spanish speakers -- and enjoyed a more varied diet -- the following year when he was assigned to Double-A El Paso. He hit .327 with 11 home runs over the first half and was promoted back to Seattle! 
 
* As a 20-year-old rookie with the Angels in 1968, Rodriguez asked Cuban-born teammate Orlando McFarlane to be his translator during an interview with *The Sporting News*. ""He doesn't try to learn English,"" McFarlane complained as an aside to the reporter, ""and all he talks about -- even in Spanish -- is baseball, baseball, baseball."" Rodriguez, who had been waiting to hear McFarlane's Spanish translation, suddenly perked up. ""Ah! B√©isbol! Comprendo b√©isbol!"" 
 
* The following year, Rodriguez tried a different player as his translator -- the Mexican-born Ruben Amaro Sr., father of the future major league outfielder and front office executive. During spring training in 1969, Amaro and Rodriguez entertained their teammates by enthusiastically singing ""Hava Nagila"" in the Angels clubhouse. ""The thing about this song,"" Amaro said, ""is that you can get by just singing Hava Nagila. I'm sure that Aurelio thinks those are the only words."" 
 
* Rodriguez said he eventually learned English by watching television and movies, mostly westerns. 
 
* Rodriguez was one of only three Latin American-born players on the Yankees in 1980 -- the other two were Ed Figueroa (Puerto Rico) and Luis Tiant (Cuba). In 1981, the only Latinos were Rodriguez and the Dominican-born Bill Castro. Compare that to this year, when the Yankees had 13 players born in Latin America -- and that doesn't include Carlos Rod√≥n, who was born in Florida to Cuban parents, or the Mexican heritage of the Texas-born Jose Trevino and Arizona-born Alex Verdugo. 
 
* In fact, in 1982, the *Hartford Courant* assigned a bilingual reporter named Clemson Smith Mu√±iz to cover the Yankees, but no Latino players made the Opening Day roster. (Rodriguez had been traded in November, and Castro in March.) Mu√±iz was in the clubhouse one day and, frustrated about something, started cursing in Spanish. Lou Piniella laughed and asked: *""¬øQu√© te pasa?""* Sweet Lou was born in Florida, but grew up speaking Spanish because his grandparents were from Spain! 
 
* How good was Aurelio defensively? [This video](https://youtu.be/lNTXKMTlBAU?si=hUggePD5VU_if6WO) has a few highlights as well as rave reviews from teammates Alan Trammell and Al Kaline. 
 
* Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell: ""He had probably the best arm I've ever seen on any infielder, bar none."" 
 
* Rodriguez credited his extraordinary defense to growing up playing on the rock-hard, pebble-strewn infields of Sonora. Ruben Amaro Sr., his fellow Mexican-born teammate from the Angels who acted as his translator in 1969, said if you could survive as an infielder in Sonora, you could play anywhere. 
 
* In *The New Bill James Historical Abstract*, Bill James ranked Rodriguez as the 91st best third basemen of all time (or at least, of all time up to 2001, when the book was published). That rating is based almost entirely on his defense. ""Among the 100 third basemen listed here, Aurelio had the highest percentage of his career value in defensive accomplishments, rather than offensive."" (James used his own system, called Win Shares, rather than Wins Above Replacement.) Second on the list in terms of percentage of total value based on fielding was Clete Boyer, who played third for the great Yankee dynasty of the early 1960s. In 16 major league seasons, Boyer -- ranked 63rd by James -- was worth 27.8 bWAR despite an 86 OPS+; Rodriguez had 15.1 bWAR despite a 76 OPS+. Nettles, with 67.9 bWAR and a 110 OPS+, was 13th. 
 
* In Phil Pepe's *Few and Chosen: Defining Yankee Greatness Across the Eras* (2001), Whitey Ford debated who had the better glove at third base, Boyer or Nettles... and for that matter, who was the best he'd ever seen. ""The great defensive third basemen in my time were Boyer, Nettles, Mike Schmidt, Sal Bando, Buddy Bell. Aurelio Rodriguez was as good as anybody, and he had the best arm I ever saw on a third baseman. But you have to put up some offensive numbers to get noticed,"" the Chairman of the Board said. As to which was the best, his answer was: ""It depends on who you talk to."" 
 
* Rodriguez's fielding was so good that the Yankees thought they could pry away Lou Whitaker from the Tigers. In 1976, the 19-year-old Whitaker was named the Florida State League MVP after hitting .297/.376/.355 with 48 stolen bases as a third baseman. Tigers scout Hoot Evers wanted to fast-track Whitaker to the majors, but Rodriguez won the Gold Glove at third that year and Tigers GM Jim Campbell wanted to keep him at the hot corner. Seeing Whitaker's path to the majors was blocked, the Yankees tried to buy him from the Tigers for the jaw-dropping (at the time) price of $500,000. Campbell turned it down and told his coaches to find another position for Whitaker. And so when Whitaker got a cup of coffee in September 1977, it was at second base... where he would stay for 19 seasons! 
 
* Detroit's Mark Fidrych -- the oddball pitcher who took the league by storm as a rookie after going 19-9 with a majors-best 2.34 ERA in 1976 -- was famous for talking to himself on the mound. Actually, Rodriguez said, Fidrych was talking to the *ball*. ‚ÄúCome on, you bleep, we gotta get in there,‚Äô‚Äù Rodriguez said, recalling the Bird's chatter. ‚ÄúI can hear everything at third base. ‚ÄòTake it easy, one more, come on let‚Äôs go.‚Äô I had to put my glove over my face in the last inning. I was starting to laugh.‚Äù  
 
* Rodriguez was involved in a strange play during the 1978 season in a game against the Minnesota Twins. Minnesota's Dan Ford was on first base when the batter hit a gapper to right-center. ""Disco Dan"" rounded second and motored toward third base as the right fielder tried to gun him down. The throw beat him, but was way off line, so Aurelio had to go get it. Ford, instead of sliding into the bag, inexplicably ran toward Rodriguez and slid into him -- about 15 feet from third base!  
 
* After Nettles went out with hepatitis -- the reason the Yankees traded for Rodriguez -- the Yankees went 15-17 in their first 32 games without him. What had been a 7 1/2 game lead shrank to just a half game. Steinbrenner said one reason for the slide was the absence of Nettles, and the third baseman -- who often feuded with Steinbrenner in the press -- quipped: ""It took him eight years to decide I was indispensable."" 
 
* Rodriguez had two managers in Detroit with Yankee connections. The first was Billy Martin, his manager from 1971 to 1973. Billy no doubt saw something of himself in the scrappy, hustling infielder. ""The young guy's a battler all the way,"" Martin said. The second was Ralph Houk, his manager from 1974 to 1978. Signed in 1938 by Yankee scout Bill Essick, Houk was a Yankee player, coach, manager, and general manager before returning to the dugout as manager from 1967 to 1973. He ended his 35 years of employment with the Yankees a year after George Steinbrenner bought the team, saying he could no longer abide with his constant meddling. 
 
* During the strike-shortened 1981 season, Major League Baseball ruled the teams that were in first place before the strike and the teams that were in first place after the strike would play each other in a best-of-five series. If the same team had the best record in both the first half and the second half, that team would play the runner-up in the second half. This meant the first half winner had no incentive to play hard in the second half, and the Yankees -- 34-22 before the strike -- went 25-26 after. Steinbrenner was incensed that his players looked to be loafing in the second half. He singled out for punishment Reggie Jackson, who hit .255/.309/.294 in his first 15 games after returning from the strike. To embarrass him, Steinbrenner ordered manager Gene Michael to use the light-hitting Rodriguez as a pinch hitter for Reggie in the eighth inning of a 3-0 game against the Twins on [August 25](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA198108250.shtml). (Aurelio singled!) Reggie was then sat the next three games. When Reggie finally returned to the lineup, he hit .279/.338/.549 the rest of the way! 
 
* Prior to the 1981 season, a Brooklyn bartender named Dick Lally wrote a book called *The Bartender's Guide to Baseball*. Presumably intended to dazzle bar patrons with quirky stats and funny anecdotes, Lally included an unusual all-star team composed of the players with the lowest batting averages at each position who lasted 15 years or more in the majors. ""This team proves that perseverance is the key to a long career in baseball,"" Lally told *The New York Times*. ""If a player can do one thing exceptionally well, such as fielding or stealing bases or drawing a base on balls, it can make up for batting deficiencies."" Clete Boyer (career .242 hitter) was the third baseman, but, Lally acknowledged, Aurelio Rodriguez would pass him if he played in 1981, which would be his 15th season. Sure enough, Rodriguez did play that year -- and two more after that -- to qualify. His .237 career average knocked Boyer off the team. 

* Tucker Ashford, the Yankee prospect who made Rodriguez expendable after the 1981 World Series, didn't survive spring training. He made two errors at third base in an exhibition game against the Mets, prompting George Steinbrenner to snarl to reporters, ""We've seen enough of Tucker Ashford."" Indeed, he was never seen in pinstripes again, despite another impressive year in Triple-A in 1982 (.332/.399/.467 in 540 at-bats). After the season he was traded across town for two minor leaguers, but soon the Mets quickly saw enough of him too; they gave him just 56 at-bats in 1983 and shipped him off to the Royals, where he had 13 at-bats in 1984 and never returned to the majors. Ashford hit .218/.282/.318 in 510 major league at-bats scattered between 1976 and 1985, and .284/.358/.432 in 2,708 at-bats in Triple-A.
 
* Having traded Rodriguez, and given up on Ashford, the Yankees needed to find someone else to be Nettles's backup prior to the 1982 season. They traded for former Red Sox third baseman Butch Hobson as a stopgap, then in April finally pulled the trigger on a long-rumored deal for Twins infielder Roy Smalley. Smalley eventually took over at shortstop, sending fan favorite Bucky Dent to the bench, and then to the Texas Rangers in a trade for former Met Lee Mazzilli. 
 
* On [June 2, 1976](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET197606020.shtml), the Tigers were beating the Brewers, 4-1. Milwaukee's George Scott had been hit by a pitch in the top of the sixth, so Milwaukee pitcher Jim Colborn retaliated by hitting Rodriguez with a pitch in the bottom of the inning. Rodriguez charged the mound and the benches emptied, but no real punches were thrown. As he was pulled away, Rodriguez shouted at Colborn that if he hit him again, the next time he'd charge the mound with his bat and hit Colborn in the head with it. Asked by reporters after the game about Rodriguez's threat, Colborn laughed it off. ‚ÄúAll I‚Äôd have to do is make my head look like a slider and he‚Äôd miss it by 6 inches!‚Äù 
 
* Despite being famed for his weak bat, Rodriguez had four games in his career with two home runs, including as a Yankee on [May 10, 1981](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SEA/SEA198105100.shtml). His two home runs that day were off Seattle pitcher Jerry Don Gleaton. 
 
* And on [September 11, 1975](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS197509110.shtml), Boston's Luis Tiant had a no-hitter with two outs in the eighth inning broken up by Rodriguez's clean single up the middle. 
 
* In 1977, Rodriguez had an embarrassing injury when he slipped and fell in a hotel shower, suffering a hairline fracture to a rib. 
 
* Rodriguez wore \#12, \#47, and \#1 when with the Angels, and \#2 when with the Senators. He wore \#4 with the Tigers and the Padres. After he left the Yankees, Rodriguez wore \#20 and \#22 with the White Sox and \#6 with the Orioles. When he came to the Yankees, all his former and future numbers were taken, starting with \#4 which obviously wasn't an option. \#12 was being worn by Jim Spencer, \#47 by Dennis Sherrill, \#1 reserved for the perpetually about to be re-hired Billy Martin, \#2 was worn by Bobby Murcer, \#20 by Bucky Dent, \#22 by Ruppert Jones, and \#6 by Brad Gulden. So Rodriguez took \#27, and he only just barely got that -- it had been only available for a month, after the July 1 release of [previously forgotten Yankee Paul Blair](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1g1dnlz/no_game_until_monday_yay_so_lets_remember_a/). \#27 has been worn since 2018 by Giancarlo Stanton; it also was worn by previously forgotten Yankees [Darrell Rasner](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1anputy/no_game_until_two_weeks_from_today_so_lets/) and [Bob Wickman](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/wwgvi4/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/). Joe Girardi wore \#27 during his first two years as Yankee manager, then switched to \#28 after the Yankees won their 27th championship in 2009. 
 
* As noted above, [previously forgotten Yankee Jonathan Albaladejo](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1bvmz2g/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/) has eight vowels in his first and last name. So do Jonathan Loaisiga and Isiah Kiner-Falefa. If Ed Figueroa had gone by his given first name -- Eduardo -- he would have tied Aurelio with nine vowels in his first and last name.
 
* You can also get to eight vowels if you spell out David (two) John (one) LeMahieu (five) or Jasrado (three) Chisholm (two) Junior (three). 
 
Aurelio Rodriguez was one those Yankees I had heard of but knew almost nothing about. He's almost forgotten today, but in his hey-day, guys like Duke Snider, Brooks Robinson, and Whitey Ford raved about his defense. And had the Yankees won the 1981 World Series, he would have been one of the heroes. A Yankee worth remembering!",16,1735398834.0,NYYankees,3,0.94,False

I searched for a while but couldn't seem to find it. So I remember it was about an older peter parker. He had this job at some lab (I think it might have been horizon labs) and he got it by bumping into the ceo in a coffee shop and solving something on the guys tablet. Anyway this peter parker was pretty rich and he had like a personal lab sort of thing where he developed his spider tech. He created an AI (I think its name was KAOS). So he has improved his fighting style by training with I think it was shang chi but it could have been Iron fist. So Tony stark comes to recruit him to fight in civil war (I think he was about 22 at this point) then he talked captain america down? So then later he meets gwen stacy in the lab that he works and then it goes on like that. Gwen eventually faces Rhino while Peter is battling someone else and (gwen is spider woman at this point) and the ai in the suit advices gwen to use the steam pipes to overpower rhino like peter had done earlier. Thank you so much for all your time and help guys. Just keep in mind that some details may not be the most accurate. Thanks again.",3,1735398705.0,FanFiction,0,1.0,False

I can recall being stood waiting for him in his room in lingerie, he looked at me, told me to get something on, coz he was going outside and wanted me to join. after about three - four months off this happening, other 'red flags' was more apparent. he was always a drinker which I didn't mind, never been one to judge, I like a drink myself but when he was drinking 4 cans a night after work, every night and then more so on the weekend, where he wouldn't drive to see me, or collect me from work (he finished at 2pm and I finished at 5:30pm), having me wait in the poring rain to travel half way across the city as he 'wanted a drink', or going out for a meal and he would leave me at the table for min of 10 minuets, spending most of his money on the gambling machines in and pub / that he saw, then asking me to pay for cigs for him, it started to become to much. one night I spoke with his brother about my concerns and asked for advise on how to re-connect with my ex, but speaking to him was like I was talking to a better version of the man I was in love with. he did drink, but offered to pick me up from work next time before he does, he does gamble but not all his money, and he does smoke as well but not as much as my ex did, or ask me to pay for it. After speaking to him I started to see how much I wasn't meant to be with my ex, but I also started to look at his brother diffrently. I know it's wrong but I wished that I met his brother first, and I was with him instead, even feeling like I was punched in the gut when he told us he had a new gf himself. But once one crack appears, its only a matter of time till it grew beyond repair, I knew I couldn't stay both in that relationship knowing how unhappy I was and how I was starting to think about someone else, but also in that family, the last thing I wanted was to break up the family by any of my mistakes. so at the end of July I broke up with my ex. I was a reck I might not have been happy but I lost my first love, part of my family of the last two years and my friend all in one go. so when at a away game I saw my ex's mum, brother and friend, I was happy to see them and asked them to come over. we stood and chatted for a while waiting for the coats. this looking back was a big mistake. I ended up sitting next to my ex's brother for a 4 hour car ride, in which everyone was drinking as much as they could as per the rugby norm. we spoke, laughed, and spent the time listening to music like old times, and was nice. after the match (which we sadly lost) all emotions where heightened, and the drink was definitely taking effect. I saw the brother stood outside the coat and we stood chatting for a minute whilst sharing a cig. in my drunken state, I confessed to his brother how I saw him as the better version of my ex, how I wished I met him first and I would have been with him and not my ex. as the words left my mouth I realised what I was actually saying, but before I could apologise his brother kissed me. we spent the rest of the way home kissing, flirting and arranging to meet up again. thankfully once I had slept off the alcohol I quickly messaged his brother apologising for what had happened and explained that we could never see each other like that again which we both agreed as I still needed to heal and he was still with his gf. which leads me back here, nearly a year laster still feeling awful for what iv done. so reddit, am I the arsehole?

About a year ago, I finally produced a draft I was satisfied with. So I had a several proof versions printed to give to writers and avid readers I know to get their feedback.

I understand asking someone to read a 350 page book is an imposition. If someone doesn't want to, or just doesn't have the time, I don't take it personally. But my mother is *a retired librarian* who reads multiple books a week. 

Anyway, I gave it to her, and she seemed excited. But as the weeks went by, when I visited, I noticed my book sitting there on the coffee table, no bookmark in it, as other books came and went from her pile.

After a few months, I asked if she'd had the chance to start my book. She told me she hadn't because she'd had too many titles on hold at the library.

Another month went by, and still she didn't touch it. Finally I asked for the copy back so I could give it to someone else.

She handed it to me, totally impassive, and said, ""Maybe another time.""

I don't know. I honestly feel a little silly about how much this hurt me.

I should add I'm a professional writer. I've written for major magazines and newspapers. There's a decent chance my book will actually be published. And I guess my mom just... won't read it?",154,1735398646.0,BoomersBeingFools,43,0.97,False

(I never take naps, so this was unusual). So now I'm permanetly on a nigh schedule. I have chronic insomnia off my medication, but there's such a vast improvement taking it that I haven't had to seek any treatment for it outside of the medication I'm already on. (For reference, I skipped a week of doses on accident and would sleep anywhere from 3-7am to 12-1pm, last night i took it and slept from 12am to 9am. The difference is night and day.) 

Also, whenever I get my blood pressure checked while I'm taking it, it's usually much lower than when I'm off it (both in normal range, but I err on the higher side when I'm off meds and err on the lower side while on them). I thought this was normal until I googled ""lower blood pressure on atomoxitine"" this morning and found apparently its supposed to *raise* my blood pressure. 

I knew the fatigue was somewhat weird already because there's been reports of it making REM difficult and increasing energy, but there's been enough people saying that it makes them more drowsy that I figured it must be like how some people with ADHD get more tired when they drink coffee. I haven't been able to find anything on it lowering blood pressure though.

Would love to investigate the science behind this, because it's funny to me that a drug that's apparently supposed to raise my blood pressure (and my family has a history of hypertension) actually lowers it. So this is like a 3-in-1 treatment for me.

1ho7hh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/1ho7hh0/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 28/12/2024**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

We did a coffee date, then I invited him to a group activity at a brewpub with some of my friends.I thought it went well, he mixed well with my friends. We kissed at the end of the night. He's visiting his family for the next week but we've been texting daily. Last night I had dinner with one of my friends from the other night. And she let me know last night she accidently swiped on my date on the app. They matched, and she said wait are you the guy from (place) and he said yes, and she was ""gorgeous."" Now, I'm not assuming we are exclusive. But coming on to one of my friends, rubs me wrong. I now recall him texting me afterwards, asking the names of my friends. On his end I asked him about it, and he said he swiped on her before he knew me. He finds us ""both attractive"". I did have a good feeling about it but now...

1ho7g5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ho7g5w/my_friends_and_i_set_out_to_hunt_pythons_and/,My friends and I set out to hunt pythons and encountered a monster in the woods.,"The fat cop tapped his fingers impatiently on the beige table in the dimly lit interrogation room. I suppose the dim light is supposed to be intimidating but, after eight hours of nearly nonstop questioning, it was more comforting than anything.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you tell me one more time what happened to your friends‚Äù he snarled, clearly unimpressed with the story I‚Äôd finished telling only moments ago. I inadvertently let out an exasperated sigh and dropped my head into my hands. He scribbled something into a small, coffee-stained notebook. Crossing his arms above his big belly, he leaned back onto his too-small metal folding chair and silently waited for me to respond.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you three times already.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell tell me again!‚Äù he demanded, punctuating the sentence with one loud smack of his open palm on the rickety table between us. I jumped, not expecting the sudden increase in volume.

‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù I yelped. ‚ÄúOkay... It was a hot day...‚Äù

\~ \~ \~ 

It was a hot day in South Florida and the iguanas were sunning themselves on the vibrant green grass lining the canal. The airboat bounced gently as it floated atop the water towards our drop-off point in the Everglades. Beau, the airboat operator, was telling us a long-winded story about his time in Vietnam during the war. I think he was happy to be in the presence of other veterans, though Alex, Rick, and I spent our time serving in the Middle East. A far cry from the forests of Vietnam. A far cry, too, from the humid, mosquito-filled air of the Everglades. The three of us really were out of our element as we headed deeper and deeper into the swampy wilderness.

""If I were 20 years younger, and 'bout 50 pounds lighter, I'd join you boys out there today and show you how it's done"" chimed Beau, patting his rotund belly. ""Ain't nothing sound more fun than blastin' the head off a python, or so I'd imagine."" He released the controls of the airboat just long enough to pantomime the motion of repeatedly shooting a rifle with his calloused hands. This made me chuckle. Looking around the boat, it occurred to me that we really were just a bunch of middle aged buffoons looking to relive our glory days. Alex, Rick, and I intended to do so by hunting an invasive species of python through the thick brush of the South Floridian wetlands. Beau did so by transporting us from shore to wetland on our mission like the Vietnam-era helicopter pilot he once was.

Alex, who had grown out a bushy handlebar mustache for exactly this occasion, had a pair of sleek, black night vision goggles dangling around his thick neck, despite the fact that we weren't planning to stay out past about 4pm. Rick, on the other hand, was wearing a short sleeve shirt -- though I had repeatedly warned him about thorns and poison ivy-- and had brought almost nothing in the way of survival gear except a leather tool belt that held a small pistol on one side and two bowie knives on the other. I would pay a lot of money to see him fight a 12-foot python in hand-to-hand combat but, if all went well, I might get to witness it for free. Since Rick was chronically underprepared, and Alex was chronically overprepared in all the wrong ways, I had purchased us each a new machete-- paying extra to have them professionally sharpened-- and insisted that we bring them along.

""Did you both bring your machetes?"" I asked, hoping they'd remembered to pack at least one useful piece of equipment in their tattered camouflage backpacks.

""Sir, yes, Sir!"" shouted Rick, planting his extended palm on his forehead in a traditional military salute, which had the dual purpose of answering my question and mocking me for asking it at all.

""You know you're not in charge out here. We don't have to listen to you anymore,"" said Alex. ""But yes. I brought the damn machete."" He was pretending to be a hard ass but I could see a hint of smile peeking out beneath his ridiculous facial hair. Unfortunately, and by the grace of God, these two idiots were my best friends, and I was excited for a long day of hiking, banter, and bloodshed.

\~\~\~

""Bloodshed?"" the cop repeated, flipping his lips downward as he scribbled in his miniature notebook. I didn't have to look to closely to see that his handwriting was borderline illegible and sloping slightly downward as the sentence went on, and on, and on. He must have thought that bit was important.

""Python blood,"" I clarified.

He let out a gruff chuckle, which turned into a continuous dry cough as he waved his hand for me to continue.

\~\~\~

By the time we arrived on the island, we each had a mile wide grin plastered on our faces. We gathered up our supplies and, one by one, stepped off the boat and onto the soft mucky embankment. My brand new boots immediately began sinking into the brown sludge, which was roughly the same texture as bread pudding. Alex and Rick shifted their feet from one position to another, trying to fight gravity, and failing just as I was. I pulled a granola bar out of my backpack and ate while listening to Beau's instructions and the pitter patter of small critters chasing one another beneath the underbrush. There was a small gator, only a few feet long, warming its cold blood on the opposite side of the channel. The sun reflected beautifully off its rough exterior and I understood why women once paid good money for alligator skin shoes and handbags.

""Alright, boys. I'll wait here. Head back before the sun gets to settin', you hear?"" he said while attaching wriggling live bait to the hook on the end of his fishing pole. He leaned back in the captains chair, fetched a cold beer from the styrofoam cooler between his feet, and cast his fishing line into the algae tinted water beside the boat. ""Ya'll have fun now and holler if ya'll need rescuin'!""

He must have thought that was a funny joke because I could hear his continuous laughter slowly fading as we walked away, heading steadily into the damp woods. We walked for quite some time, violently slicing through vines and briars with our recently sharpened machetes, partially for ease of mobility through the thick foliage but mostly just for fun. I felt vindicated that, despite the ridicule I‚Äôd endured for insisting upon the machetes, they were already proving both useful and entertaining.

We hadn't been off the boat fifteen minutes before my upper lip sweat began beading up and running down both sides of my chin, leaving a trail of dewy moisture reminiscent of Alex's mustache. The air was chicken noodle soup, and we were the overcooked carrots floating in the warm, salty broth. My sopping wet shirt clung to my skin and my too-long hair stuck to my forehead. The heavy backpack digging into my shoulders was filled to capacity with water bottles but I'd began to fear they wouldn't last.

""Woo-eee,"" howled Rick, wiping sweat off his forehead and flicking it onto the ground, ""it's god damn hot as shit out here."" Rick had a way with words. If he hadn't been such a damn fine soldier, he may well have been a poet.

I could hear the words before they even came out of his mouth and began rolling my eyes in advance. ""You know what they say,"" said Alex, right on cue, ""it's not the heat. It's the humidity."" Rick and I let out an audible groan in unison. It echoed slightly and sounded almost melodic against the din of invisible crickets and almost imperceptibly buzzing gnats.

We continued on, mostly in silence punctuated by the occasional outburst as one or the other of us was bit by something swarming, crawling, or flying across our arms and necks. Alex liked to help Rick by smacking the mosquitos on the back of his head with a bit of extra force, to ensure that they were really dead. Rick, in turn, would shove Alex forward and laugh as he weaved and bobbed in the silty mud trying to regain his balance. It seemed there wasn't a single dry patch of land for miles. The entire Earth may well have been a puddle for all the splashing we were doing as we headed steadily into the wilderness, further and further away from Beau and his cooler full of refreshing, ice cold beer. Hopefully, there would be three left for us when we returned to the boat this afternoon.

""God damn it! I haven't seen one damn living thing out here except you idiots. Not a bird or a squirrel or a gator and definitely not no damn python"", Rick whined as he stabbed through the bark of a tree with his favorite bowie knife. The one with a carved deer bone handle. He was right. We'd been fighting our way through thorns and gloopy muck for at least two hours now and hadn't seen so much as a lizard in the last fourty-five minutes. Rick twisted the knife around in the tree, clearly upset that he hadn't had the chance to shoot his shiny new gun.

""You know what it means when it's quiet like this?"" Alex asked, gesturing his arms vaguely towards our lush surroundings. Rick slipped his knife back into it's leather holster and turned towards us, waiting for Alex to finish his thought. We stood silently for a moment with nothing but the incessant humming of hungry mosquitos to indicate that there were other living creatures in the woods besides the three of us.

He continued in a whisper, as though he feared the mosquitos might overhear something private. ""It means there aren't any prey animals left."" Rick and I exchanged a sideways glance. Alex leaned in close and lowered his voice even further. ""If there's no prey, there must be an abundance of predators."" With that, he stood up straight and returned to his normal speaking voice. ""Come on, guys, we must be getting close to the pythons. Maybe we'll even find a nest. You know, they pay extra if you find a nest.""

I couldn't fault his logic, though I didn't much like it. I suppose I should be thrilled at the thought of an abundance of pythons. More pythons means more to shoot at, and a higher chance of actually hitting something. Though the thought of an *abundance* of giant, slithering reptiles sent a shiver down my spine. Or maybe that was just a bead of sweat. I don't know how many pythons I was expecting, or hoping, to encounter, but it certainly wasn't any more than three. One for each of us. Maybe that had been na√Øve. They are invasive after all.

Alex and Rick began pushing their way forward through the vines. I followed mindlessly though I began to feel unsettled in my surroundings. We trudged on for ten or so minutes, maybe more, without saying a word to one another. The entangled branches and cascading vines around us were suffocating. The briars were knives and the mud was quicksand. Clearly dehydration was beginning to set in. ""Hey, I'm going to stop for a minute. You guys go on ahead,"" I announced.

""You sure?"" asked Alex, looking around warily, ""I'll tell you, I'm not sold on the idea of putting much distance between us. Even though I don't particularly care for you fellas.""

I threw my backpack onto the muddy ground and used it as a makeshift chair. It was lumpy and uncomfortable. ""Don't worry, I'll catch up. Your damn stomping is scaring away all the pythons anyway,"" I joked, stamping my foot on the soggy leaves to imitate his heavy walk.

""He has a point, Alex,"" added Rick, ""Maybe we should go different directions for a bit. We only have another two hours or so before we need to start heading back towards Beau, anyway. We could meet back up at the boat.""

I choked on my water. The thought of splitting up for more than a minute or two made me uncomfortable but I felt I couldn't protest since, in a way, it had been my idea in the first place. Despite, or especially because of, everything we'd been through together, I didn't want to let the guys know that I was feeling apprehensive. After all, what we were doing amounted to no more than a walk in the woods. We'd been through worse than this in basic training. I put on a brave face, knowing that if I didn't, they'd relentlessly mock me every chance they got for at least the rest of our trip, maybe longer.

""Good idea, Rick,"" I replied, turning to Alex, ""unless you're too chicken."" Rick laughed and flapped his arms like wings, teasing Alex in exactly the same childish way I had been afraid of them teasing me. Alex sighed in response. ""Fine, we can split up. Just don't go too far. Try not to do anything stupid, and, I don't know, yell if you need help or something, okay?"" he relented.

""Aye, Aye, Cap'n"" Rick barked, snapping his palm onto his forehead in the same overexaggerated salute he'd used on me back at the boat.

After I divvied up what little water I had remaining in my backpack, we said our goodbyes, and headed off in a different direction. Rick slapped my ass as he headed past me towards a slight opening in the trees to the west. Alex raised his hands up above his head and fashioned his fingers into peace signs, in what I'm assuming was intended to be a mediocre Richard Nixon impression, before stepping over a downed tree and disappearing into the woods to the north. The crunching of leaves under boots slowly faded away until, eventually, I heard nothing at all. My heartbeat and breathing were the only audible sounds left to hear as I stood alone in the wilderness. Turning slowly in a circle, I surveyed my surroundings and considered which direction I should take further into the woods, if I should go further at all. Images of Beau lounging in his captains chair, fitting another worm to his fishing hook flashed through my mind and I briefly considered abandoning my pursuit and heading back to the boat early.

It wasn't so much the silence as the oppressive stillness that bothered me. Large trees with interwoven branches loomed overhead blocking every hint of a breeze. Nothing splashed in the murky puddles. Nothing scurried along in the bushes. There wasn't so much as a rustle of the leaves to suggest the presence of a single living creature, hidden from view by the dense foliage, and while I'd never cared much for squirrels, I found myself longing to catch even a glimpse of one.

Since Rick had gone west, and Alex north, I chose to continue on in the direction we'd already been headed before splitting up-- east. It seemed to be the direction with the most amount of space between the trees, making it easier to slip through the foliage without expending too much energy hacking through vegetation. My machete arm was beginning to ache. So were my feet. Blisters had begun to form between my big toe and its neighbor as my slightly too-small shoes crammed them together with each step.

It had been more than ten minutes since the crunching of Alex and Ricks boots behind me had faded into memory and the oppressive stillness of the woods enveloped me completely. I passed the time and ignored the pain in my feet the same way I had in basic training, by imagining which famous sitcom characters would win in a cage match. I was torn between Kramer from *Seinfeld* and Phoebe from *Friends*, leaning towards Phoebe, when I first noticed the smell.

The scent of decomposition lingered in the moist air, sticking to my skin and my clothes. Even when I held my breath, I could smell it. I could almost taste it, even. I pulled my wet shirt over my mouth and nose, breathing through the fabric to block the acrid smell. Though really all it did was replace the rotting smell of decomposition with the sour smell of my own rancid sweat.

The branches and roots in this small clearing were strewn, snapped and broken, across the ground, and in the center, laid the bloated corpse of a deer. My feet, without the consent of my brain, much less my nose, walked me closer to the corpse. I stopped a foot or two back, blocked from moving closer by an impenetrable, almost palpable, curtain of the sickly sweet scent of decomposition, carried back and forth from the rotting deer to my nostrils on the wings of buzzing flies. From this distance I could see that the deer had certainly not died of natural causes, unless you consider having your rib cage snapped and broken inward to be natural. The corpse was mangled in a way I hadn't noticed from the edge of the clearing, with a collapsed ribcage and twisted spine, causing its front and back legs to jut out in opposite directions. The eyes, at least, the bits of them that hadn't been overtaken by flies and maggots, bulged outward from the sockets as though they had tried to flee, leaving the rest of the body behind.

Any creature capable of crumpling a deer like an empty aluminum can must be much stronger than any I'd be comfortable encountering in the wild, at least not without shitting my pants. My eyes scanned the tree line, searching through the leaf litter and swaying vines for any hint of something that might be waiting for an opportune moment to attack. My knuckles turned white as I squeezed my fingers around the hilt of my machete. My heart wasn't racing so much as pounding in my chest. My position in the open clearing left me more vulnerable than I cared to admit in the moment. Slowly, very slowly, I turned to examine the trees behind me, where I could have sworn I'd heard the faintest sound of twigs breaking only moments before. I held my breath and stared straight ahead, daring the creature to make an appearance and meet the newly sharpened edge of my machete. A minute went by. Then two, maybe more, and nothing, not so much as a lizard, came forward into the clearing. My heart rate slowly returned to its steady rhythm. The tension in my shoulders released. Animals kill each other in the woods all the time. This was nothing out of the ordinary. I let out a chuckle, and made a mental note to tell the boys all about the mutilated deer when we met up later. Beau, more than anyone, would be interested in hearing about the more gruesome aspects of our day, decomposing deer corpses included.

I'd only just released the hilt of my machete, allowing the blood to return to my knuckles, when my relief was interrupted by an abrupt and piercing scream. My viscera lurched inside me at the shock of such a vibrant sound. A second scream tore through the tree tops from what sounded like the direction Rick had gone after we split up. We hadn't been walking for long so he couldn't be far behind me. I ran, trampling my own muddy footprints and taking a branch to the eye as I forced my body through the trees.

""Rick?"" I yelled, ""Rick?""

A gunshot echoed through the trees in response. A single bird burst through the leaves and flew overhead, proving I hadn't imagined the sudden noise. ""RICK"" I screamed, louder this time. As loud as my dry mouth would allow. My throat began to feel desiccated and my tongue stuck to my soft palate with every swallow.

Rick did not respond. Not another scream or even a yelp to direct the wild movement of my body through the dense brush. The bird, perhaps my only living companion in these woods, had fled in the opposite direction. Tears stung my eyes, even more so in the eye that had been scratched by the branch. I yearned for even a brief glimpse of my friends. A peek of a t-shirt through the leaves. A flash of skin as they ran past. The glint of a machete. A single sound would be welcome. A screech. A cough. A barrage of insults, even. Anything besides the hollow echo of my rapid breath and the whir of swarming gnats.

I'd only vaguely perceived a rustling in the branches in front of me before I collided violently with a person moving just as wildly in the opposite direction. ""God damn it all to hell!"" Alex cursed, having landed hard in on his ass in the mud. ""You the one doing all that damn screaming? What the hell're you shooting at?"" He stood and brushed the mud off the seat of his pants before helping me to my feet.

""It'd better be a damn huge python and you'd better've hit it square as hell on for all that hollering. You scared the every loving shit out of me, man,"" he scolded.

""Wasn't me,"" I replied, gulping air into my lungs, ""must have been Rick. Haven't seen him yet. I heard him screaming, same as you.""

""God damn it."" Alex threw his hat onto the ground like an angry baseball coach on the sidelines of a losing game. ""I bet that asshole is fucking with us.""

A glint of light caught my eye. The reflection of a single sunbeam off a metal object partially covered by wet, brown leaves on the sodden ground. My dry mouth became, somehow, drier. ""I don't think he's fucking with us, Alex.""

We'd collided at the entrance to another small clearing, clearly created through forceful means as the palms and shrubbery had been disturbed. The trees were bent and broken at unnatural angles, as though they'd been intentionally snapped. The smaller plants had been flattened against the leaf covered ground. ""This looks similar to the clearing where that deer got crushed,"" I said.

""What the fuck are you talking about, Dan?"" Alex demanded. Right, I hadn't told him about the deer. When would I have had the chance. Before I could explain, I was silenced by the the pressure of a heavy, slithering sensation atop my boots.

I wasn‚Äôt particularly afraid of snakes but having one writhing in place on top of an appendage was certainly not my favorite. And this one felt very large. Though I suppose that's the problem with pythons, isn't it. They're usually large. Slowly looking down, I was surprised to see not scales but a long, pink lump of muscle, split on one end. The forked end of the tongue squirmed and flitted about over my boots and the bottom of my pants. I choked on my breath, afraid to turn my head and see the snake that may be attached to the other end of such a massive tongue. A stifled gasp sounded beside me and I knew that Alex had noticed the tongue, and probably the snake it was attached to.

""Dan..."" he whispered, gripping my bicep with an unnecessarily strong hand.

""I see it,"" I replied, eyes steadily fixed on my feet and feet planted like an oak tree in the ground.

""It's his machete,"" he said, raising a pointed finger towards a scatter of trampled bushes on the opposite edge of the clearing. The tongue receded from my boots, back into what I could only imagine to be the fanged maw of the single largest living being on the planet. The crunch of dry leaves sounded out beside me, like beneath a boot clad foot on a city sidewalk in autumn, as the massive creature slithered away to who knows where. I couldn't bring myself to look up and see which way it was going. My breath caught in my throat, too afraid to exit my lungs and enter the hellish wetlands that the rest of us had walked into willingly. The ringing in my ears was so loud that Alex's words sounded warbled and far away as he tried to get my attention. The *womp womp womp* of his urgent pleas barely registered as anything more than the wind rustling through the trees.

He smacked me on the back of my head. ""Dan! Look!""

""Huh? Ricks machete?"" I asked. His words crashed into my brain all at once. Right, the metal object on the ground. I turned my attention towards the silver glint at the end of his outstretched arm. Alex was right. Ricks machete was laying a few meters away, partially obstructed by branches and mud. Alex picked it up and examined it. The previously shining, never before used blade was now slightly bent and partially coated in a mix of mud and a slick reddish brown liquid.

We stood, looking at the blade, digesting it's meaning in the sweltering humidity. We'd both seen enough bloody weapons to recognize the red brown coating on the blade and we'd both seen enough sharp force trauma to hope the blood wasn't human. There were no other signs of Rick in the clearing. Not his backpack, gun, knives, tank top, boots, bad attitude, or sarcastic comments. Certainly not his body, dead or alive.

""He must have been attacked by that big ass fuckin' snake,"" I finally offered, thinking this the most logical conclusion.

""What the fuck are you talking about, man?"" Alex asked. He shot me a look that would have made Medusa shut her eyes and run.

""The big ass snake that was licking my boots over there."" I pointed to the faintly visible track of a large slithering belly in the mud. It was wider than I would have guessed and I'd have guessed it was about a meter wide.

""Shut the fuck up, Dan,"" Alex snapped. ""This is fucking serious, okay? You of all people should understand that. Rick is somewhere around here, missing his machete and probably fucking bleeding and you're going on about, what? Dead deer and big ass pythons? We haven't seen one god damn python all god damn day, Dan."" He was shaking the machete around for emphasis and only narrowly avoided slicing me into ribbons.

His tirade was interrupted as a snake the size of a Ford F150 and twice the height‚Äî not including the portion of its body obstructed from my view‚Äî rose up, out of the brush, and loomed mere inches behind Alex. Before I could utter a warning, a massive pink tongue flitted across the back of his neck. He shuddered, dropping the machete, and slapped the back of his neck as though the tongue were merely a spider or a fly or some other inconsequential being. ""Alex, do not turn around,"" I commanded, reaching my arms out to grab him.

""Why?"" Alex asked, ""what are you looking at?"" The snake loomed higher, becoming, somehow, even larger and more imposing than it had been moments ago. Its yellow eyes locked on mine as I pulled Alex closer to me. ""Just do not turn around. Walk forward slowly. Towards me,"" I repeated.

He turned around. Of course he turned around. All men will turn around when asked not to, just as all men reach out to touch artwork in a gallery even though, or specifically because, there are posted signs directing them not to do so. The next moments were a blur. Alex screamed, as expected. So did I. He ran, or attempted to run, but didn't get far before the unhinged jaws were around him in his entirety, swallowing him down, down, down into what I can only hope was a quick and painless death. For a second, before he disappeared completely behind pointed teeth, I saw only a pair of mud caked, worn down boots against the empty blue sky of the clearing.

There was nothing left to do but run, and so I did. As fast as I could. Shedding gear as I jumped over logs and tripped through puddles. Briars dug through my shirt and into my flesh, ripping, and tearing as I forced my body through tight spaces at great speed. Sweat ran down my arms, mixing with blood, and stinging my wounds.

~/~/~

""Is that what happened here?"" the cop asked, gesturing his meaty palm toward the thin scabs lining my arms from my shoulders to my fingertips.

I nodded. ""See, those look to me like the kinda wounds someone might leave behind if they were fighting for their life. Or, lives, in this case."" He raised an eyebrow and watched my face.

""These scratches are from the briars,"" I repeated, keeping my voice and my face as still and emotionless as I could manage under the circumstances.

He let out a chuckle as he flipped to a new page in his notebook and wrote a few more sentences before pausing briefly to scribble the pen in circles at the top of the page. He tossed the pen in a wire wastebasket in the corner of the room and stood up.

""I'm going to refill my coffee. While I'm gone, you better think real hard about how you want this story to end 'cause right now it's not looking too good for you, son.""

Left alone in the dark interrogation room, I wondered what Alex and Rick would think of this situation. Alex would know exactly what to say to the cop to smooth everything over. He was always good with authority. He was the only private who could show up to inspection with a wrinkled uniform and not get his ear drums blown out by the drill sergeant. Rick. on the other hand, would inevitably make me laugh despite the looming threat of serving twenty-five to life. He'd do a surprisingly accurate impression of a community college dropout turned unreasonably stern cop and I'd forget, for a moment, that he was dead and that I was being blamed for it.

The cop re-entered the room, pen in one hand, coffee in the other. He'd been gone for long enough that my tears had dried, leaving only clean streaks in my grime covered face to show they were ever there. For the first time since I'd stepped off Beaus airboat, alone, I admitted to myself how exhausted I really was. Emotionally and physically. I was more than ready for this to be over so I could curl up in bed and sleep for days, and days, and days. Even if it meant I had to sleep on the top bunk above a heavily-tattooed guy named Diesel who snores like a chainsaw and brews hooch in an aluminum toilet.

""Alright,"" grunted the cop, ""you were running through the woods and getting all tore up by 'briars.'"" He emphasized the last word and raised his hands to mime an exaggerated quotation mark.

""Right,"" I agreed, ""the briars.""

~/~/~

I don't remember a whole hell of a lot after that. Somehow, I managed to find Beau. He was sitting on his boat, just where we'd left him. Drinking beer and fishing, just like he'd said he would be. I launched myself from shore onto the boat, screaming and hollering for him to start the engine and get the hell out of there as fast as he could. ""Where are the t'others?"" he asked. ""Dead, I hope,"" I replied. We argued for a minute, I think. He asked me questions. Question after question, quickly, and at a high volume. I don't remember what he asked, and I don't remember what, or if, I'd answered, but eventually the boat was moving quickly across the water. Away from the snake, which is all that really mattered anymore. The ride back was silent except for the whir of the motor and the gasping sobs escaping from my mouth. Though, Beau must have phoned the police. The sun had sunk well below the horizon by the time we made it back to shore but every detail of the dock and palm trees were visible in the blue and red light of the waiting cop cars and ambulances.

~/~/~

""Blue and red light, huh?,"" repeated the cop. ""You think this is some kind of creative writing class, son? This ain't no damn joke. You understand?""

""You asked me to tell you what happened. Well, that's what happened,"" I replied.

‚ÄúRight, right,"" he said, closing his notebook and folding his beefy hands together on the table. ""So you really expect me to believe that your friends were eaten by some big snake?‚Äù His perpetually raised eye brow silently mocked me.

‚ÄúA very big snake,"" I clarified, ‚Äúand no, I honestly don‚Äôt, but I don‚Äôt know, maybe you and some other officers could go out and see for yourselves. It might still be hungry.‚Äù

""Oh, don't you worry, son. We've got officers out there now. Matter o' fact, I heard they already found that bent up, blood covered machete you mentioned. It's been sent off for fingerprinting and DNA testing. I have no doubt we'll find your fingerprints on the hilt and the blood of at least one, if not both, of those young men on the blade. That should be enough for any jury 'round these parts.""

He tightened a pair of handcuffs around my wrists. A little too tight, if you asked me. They really weren't necessary as I had no plan to run or to fight. The solitude of the holding cell was more than welcome after hours of non-stop questioning. It is said that the truth will set you free but the sound of the key in the lock was proof that the truth will set you free only if it is believable to those with a limited view of reality. The rusty bed frame creaked beneath my weight as I laid down. This may well be a king bed at the Ritz Carlton for how tired I was. I closed my eyes and prayed to the universe, or whichever deity was listening, that I would dream of anything, anything other than snakes.",4,1735398330.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

[Help?],"I enabled the recording as instructed but still couldn‚Äôt get it to work on my iPhone. Just wondering if anyone had success here. With the upcoming changes to the network I really wanted to respond\* to this one.

\*This is what I would have said:

**Q1**  
MSNBC played an incredibly meaningful role in my life throughout 2024. Nicolle Wallace, Joy Reid, and Rachel Maddow, in particular, make me feel smarter after watching their shows. They have this remarkable ability to unpack complex issues in ways that feel both enlightening and empowering. Nicolle Wallace‚Äôs show has become a daily staple of my work-from-home routine. Her calm, insightful commentary provides a much-needed sense of reassurance when the political world feels like absolute chaos. It‚Äôs grounding and helps me stay informed without feeling overwhelmed. I chose MSNBC over other news sources because of its thoughtful, in-depth approach to news and analysis. The network‚Äôs focus on expert perspectives and its respect for nuance make it stand out. It‚Äôs not just about headlines‚Äîit‚Äôs about understanding the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù behind the stories that shape our lives. MSNBC‚Äôs programming helps me stay engaged, informed, and hopeful in the midst of uncertain times

As the new administration prepares to take office, I am looking for coverage that prioritizes truth and accountability above all else. Nicolle Wallace, Joy Reid, and Rachel Maddow are essential viewing because they approach news with clarity, courage, and a refusal to shy away from difficult truths. With a second Trump term on the horizon, I am deeply concerned for my LGBTQ+ community, the Hispanic and Latino communities, and any marginalized group likely to be targeted by policies or rhetoric. I need a network that remains resolute in defending democracy, human rights, and the principles of free speech.

**Q2**  
I want coverage that cuts through spin and propaganda‚Äîinvestigative reporting that sheds light on government actions, challenges abuses of power, and provides historical and legal context to help viewers understand what‚Äôs at stake. It‚Äôs critical that MSNBC (or whatever it may rebrand as) protects the integrity of its journalists and steadfastly defends their ability to bear witness to history without interference or intimidation.

In terms of format, I value in-depth analysis, expert panels, and interviews with diverse voices‚Äîlegal scholars, historians, activists, and those directly impacted by policy decisions. I also want to see the network push back against false equivalencies and avoid the performative both-sides narrative that dilutes accountability. And, honestly, it‚Äôs time to rethink the platforming of voices like \[THE GUY AND HIS WIFE ON THE MORING COFFEE SHOW.\]\*\* His approach feels increasingly out of step with the urgency of this moment. There‚Äôs no room for bootlicking or complacency when the stakes are this high.

Above all, I need to trust that the network will not bend to the pressures of authoritarianism or corporate interests. A free press is a cornerstone of democracy, and I need MSNBC to stay unwavering in its commitment to truth-telling and justice.

\*\*Rules of the sub prevent mention of this guy. But we all know who I'm talking about, right?

I know you're gonna say it's fake and that you saw this Hallmark Christmas movie and I'm right there with you. Honestly, I wouldn't believe it either if it didn't happen to me. So, if you can't believe it, then just pretend and give me advice anyway like I'm a real person. Because I am.

I (32M) met Sarah (30F) in grade school in our small town. She was my first everything‚Äîgirlfriend, love, and eventually wife. We both went to college together, and after I graduated, we got married when I was 23, and she was 21. Sarah was still finishing her degree, and I worked hard to support both of us while she completed her studies.

When she got her first job, I was so proud of her. It felt like all our sacrifices and hard work were paying off, and I thought we were on our way to building a life together. For two years, everything seemed fine‚Äîor at least, I thought so.

Then one day, I came home from work and found her packing a bag.

She sat me down and told me she had been having an affair with a coworker. I was completely oblivious. She was crying and apologetic. She said she loved me but she was ""in love"" with the coworker and they had this chemistry and a deep connection and that she never felt this level of excitement and attachment with me.

At the same time, she seemed to be really apologetic and acted very guilty. She moved in with the coworker that night.

Sarah made the divorce as quick and easy as possible. She didn‚Äôt contest anything and took almost nothing. In the state we lived in, you can get a divorce in 10 days if there aren't any children involved. We filed the papers ourselves, no lawyer (couldn't afford one).

After it was final, she asked if we could be friends, and I'm ashamed to say that I just broke down and sobbed like a baby in front of her, said nothing, and left. At that point, she was 23, and I was 25.

A couple of years later, in early 2020, while riding out Covid in my hometown, my mom casually mentioned that Sarah had married the guy she left me for. Apparently, Sarah‚Äôs parents and mine had talked about it since they‚Äôre longtime friends, and Sarah‚Äôs parents were hesitant about the marriage but supported her.

Hearing that stung. I had done everything I could to move on, but knowing she had married her affair partner felt like reopening the wound. I told my mom, as kindly as I could, that I didn‚Äôt want to hear about Sarah anymore. She understood and never brought her up again.

I was broken and depressed at first, but I went to see a therapist and got on some meds. I got some certifications and, through a friend from college, I got an interview with a global consulting company. My friend was married and couldn't do the amount of travel that the job required, so he pushed hard for me for the position. I started traveling around the world and pretty much worked all the time at first. On any given day, I was either in the gym, working, or having a virtual therapy session at 3 AM. I was a dull boy. I got into incredible shape thanks to lifting and running. Eventually, I got a long-term project in Romania and was able to meet and have relationships with women.

Fast forward a few years. Recently, I had a few weeks of vacation saved up, and I wanted to spend Christmas in Reykjavik, Iceland. I went to my parents‚Äô place in my hometown for Thanksgiving with my sister and brother.

Last Thursday, I was at the local independent drug store in what passes for ""downtown"" in my hometown. It has a lunch counter like an old-fashioned drug store. I got a cup of coffee and sat down at the counter drinking it when Sarah sat down beside me and said hello. She was super nervous and red in the face. I was shocked and just sat there looking at her. I was exploding inside, but I kept my cool outwardly.

She was still beautiful. She was actually very fit herself and had lost her baby face and became maybe even more beautiful. She started off by apologizing for the way she ended our marriage. I told her she already apologized like 100 times when she dumped me, but she insisted that she was young and stupid, and over time she realized how much she had hurt me. She wanted to meet me later in a less crowded spot with fewer ""spies"" (small town, remember?).

I shook my head no and told her frankly that I didn't see what I could possibly get out of meeting with her again. That kind of took the wind out of her sails, and she kind of deflated. She admitted that it was probably more for her than for me. She said that I'd get closure not only for how she ended things but for the kind of person she was back then. She wanted to tell me about how she'd changed and what she'd learned about herself and what real love is. She wanted me to see that the person she became is someone that I could respect and maybe be friends with again.

I wanted to get the hell out of there, so I just told her I'd think about it. She gave me her number, and I went home. Apparently, my mother and sister had already heard about it from Sarah's mom. So I'm a big dumb victim of some kind of big dumb Hallmark Christmas movie hit job. My sister (29F) and mom (55F) told me that they kept up with Sarah since our divorce and they know that she's changed and that I should hear her out. My dad (56M) just shook his head and walked off. My brother (22M) thought all of this was hilarious. I asked if he wanted to chime in, and he just shrugged his shoulders and said that since Sarah and I knew each other from when we were kids, I should at least hear her out just to keep the peace between our families since we live in a small town.

Personally, I do think that her family would feel insulted if I didn't at least talk with her. I know for a fact that she's living with her parents now, so it seems like her life completely sh!t the bed. I'd kind of like to get the gory details as maybe a form of schadenfreude, but it's all behind me now, and I think it would all just make me sad.

I guess I'm a better man now that I'm more mature, more wealthy, and fitter than I was when I was with her, but I'm still the same guy that she didn't have chemistry or connection with back in the day. So I think whatever comes out of her mouth would be bullsh!t. I think she's probably a dragon cosplaying as a princess and wants me to be her white knight. F@#$k that.

My mom and sister are pushing hard for me to meet her, and my mom says that she's afraid if I don't at least hear Sarah out, that Sarah's mom will resent her and make her social life more complicated.

Let me make it clear that I have no intention of getting back with Sarah. Sarah is very beautiful, but so are the women of Romania, Iceland, and elsewhere. And they have the added bonus of not breaking my heart.

I'm interested in going just to hear about what happened to her after she dumped me and to smooth things over for my folks.

What do you think, Reddit? Should I go? I kind of want to. Talk me down off the ledge. WIBTAH if I ghosted my ex-wife?

**Commenter 1:** Sounds like you don‚Äôt need the closure so why pick at healed wounds.

Tell your mom and sister if they want to hear Sarah talk so much, they can go in your place but to leave you out of it.

**Commenter 2:** Don't go. You don't have to ghost her. You can tell her you aren't interested in rehashing the past and you wish her well. Nta

**Commenter 3:** YWNBTAH Tell your mom that you are not responsible for Sarah‚Äôs feelings nor her mothers. You‚Äôve moved on as best you can after the horrific way Sarah treated you, you have no reason to listen to whatever shitty excuses she is going to give you in order to resolve herself of guilt and frankly your mom should be ashamed of herself. Why are Sarah‚Äôs feelings/what she wants more important than yours?

**Commenter 4:** Naw ... You are a better man and just leave the past in the past. As to the social life being difficult for your mom, well she just needs to rise above it too. It's not your problem and you have your own life to live. NTA

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/n1z3SGgx6d): **December 21, 2024 (11 days later)**

Hi, I'm apparently known as the Hallmark Christmas Movie Guy.

I'm currently writing this from Reykjavik, Iceland. I have some friends I met while doing some consulting work here. This time of year, the days are very short and the northern lights are visible. Unfortunately it's supposed to be cloudy and rainy for the foreseeable future here so I'm out of luck with the aurora borealis.

We're doing a Christmas pub crawl among other things. Reykjavik is very single friendly during the holidays.

TL;DR: I met up with Sarah to shut up our families. We talked. I left. Done.

After I posted, for the next couple of days, my mom and sister kept bugging me about it until I caved. I know. I made it clear to them that I had no intention of getting back together with Sarah and that I was pissed that they thought there was a chance I'd get back together with someone who stabbed their son and brother in the heart. Finally I told Sarah, I'd meet her at the playground at our old school. It's a small town so there's only one school that's K-12.

When we met, I told her up front that I'm just there as a favor to our parents and my sister. She acknowledged that and we engaged in a little small talk. She told me that she had started following me on social media (I've since made it friends and family only) and she saw how I'd been all over the world and even commented on the girlfriend I had in Romania. I told Sarah her name was Monica and we had a great time together.

She then started in with the juicy stuff I wanted to hear. Unfortunately it wasn't very juicy. Just regular boring relationship crap. She started living with the guy and it quickly became apparent that, once she was with him, the relationship went from an exciting affair to a regular humdrum relationship. She said she knew the forbidden sparks were gone the first time she had to pick up and launder the guy's skid marked underwear. Yep, she left me for a guy who was barely toilet trained.

She said she was in denial that she couldn't have thrown me away for a guy who was no good so she doubled down by marrying him. Sarah was always very stubborn. He was apparently a good salesman and earned a lot in commissions but he was really bad with money. They had a lot of fights about money and household chores and finally she caught him cheating with a coworker (oh, the irony!). She left him with a wrecked credit score. She was pregnant with his kid at the time, so she got an ab0rt!on. (trying to avoid the filters). This is something no one in our families know about. She's been living with her parents and working at the same feed store her dad works at.

She said she wanted to reconnect with me due to the fact that we were childhood friends and had been each other's best friends for 17 years and she missed me. She started on about how much therapy she'd been through and that she is a completely different person now. She wants me to know how much she cares about me and that that girl I was best friends with is still there and blah blah blah I can't even write this manipulative sh!t out any more.

I guess I'm not a nice guy any more. I didn't want to start any kind of beef with her family and mine so I just told her that I had also changed since she dumped me. I told her that when I touch something and get burned, I don't touch it any more. I told her it's great that she worked on herself but some new guy (idiot) will have to benefit from that. When I look at her all I see is her crying telling me she's leaving me holding a proverbial knife with my blood all over it. In my mind she's a person who says ""honey I love you but I also love stabbin'!"". No thank you, ma'am. I told her that if we got together, the resentment would make me treat her like crap all the time and she didn't want or deserve that.

I told her good luck in her future endeavors and I hope she keeps up with her changes and that I had to leave to go to Iceland for Christmas (yes, I was bragging). She was tearing up and trying not to let me see her cry and I pretended not to notice.

Dad was disappointed I caved to mom and sister. He made it like I failed the test of manhood. I told my mom and sister not to expect any wedding bells or grandchildren/nephews any time soon. My brother called me a ""simp"" and so I had to wrestle him. He got me in a headlock. The guy's getting too big and I held back too much.

I left for Iceland the next day and I'm there until the new year. I'm headed to Budapest for a follow up project. Sarah is not invited.

**Commenter 1:** Good for you not letting her come back into your life.

**Commenter 2:** Your dad and brother are right. It's amazing the lack of empathy your mother and sister have towards you. They both suck.

I don‚Äôt know if this is the best place to ask this question but I didn‚Äôt get much traction in the breakups Reddit. Recently, I went through a really nasty breakup where she cheated on me after almost 3 years and it sent me into a complete spiral. One thing that was a staple of our relationship was a shared loved of all things Wizarding World. The movies were our comfort zone, we would both listen to the Audiobooks, sometimes when falling asleep, we would both read the books. Give each other Harry Potter themed gifts, wake up on a Saturday, much like today and throw on one of the movies and just have a lazy mornings drinking coffee and watching one of the films, playing Legacy, I was even planning a trip to Orlando to take her to Wizarding World once we got engaged. My pickup line on Hinge was even Harry Potter themed because she had a prompt about it. 
Long story short, I miss the comfort of Harry Potter. I want to watch the movies again and be happy, I want to listen to the audiobooks and smile again. I want to recapture that joy and not let her be the only one who keeps it. I know she doesn‚Äôt care, when logging out of her Max on my TV she was watching one of the movies. Does anyone have any advice on how to recapture my magic and begin to love and be comforted by these stories again? It meant so much to me as a child, I can‚Äôt lose it forever. Any advice at all is super appreciated. Thanks friends. ",0,1735398244.0,harrypotter,7,0.33,False

Like how some dogs just lay down and are chill? Doesn‚Äôt exist. In our puppy training class he is by far the most advanced when it comes to commands, but as soon as the command practice is over, other pups lay down and just look around and he needs to be constantly on his feet, sniffing, pulling towards other dogs (he‚Äôs overly social which we‚Äôre working on, hence the puppy class), attention barking and so on. He can only lay down when he is constantly being fed treats and they have to be high value when there‚Äôs other dogs around. As soon as I run out it‚Äôs over. People say to teach him to settle but he does so only for treats and as soon as it stops he‚Äôs done. He lets me do stuff around the house, don‚Äôt get me wrong, he can go play with his toys outside by himself, but recently he started demanding more attention even after like an hour long walk or play and training time which we do frequently, so he is not bored or movement deprived. He also has a backyard he loves to be in. He doesn‚Äôt have an issue with laying down for a nap when he gets tired, so it‚Äôs not over-tiredness anymore. 

And yes I know he is a working breed and I try to accommodate that as well as possible (plenty exercise and mental stimulation and training) and I‚Äôm looking into dog sports for him to do.

Two years ago I was a ward clerk and it was completely crushing me to be a pawn for the LDS money extortion machine. I had to tell my wife and bishop and was released. I continued to go to church for a year to ""support my wife"" and our 5 kids, but for the past year I haven't gone to church. 

I'm not happier out of the Church, but I also will never go back to that high demand religion led by hateful men pretending to speak to God. My wife has told me she would choose the church over me, and suggested we should get a divorce. The only thing that's changed is I haven't gone to church and I drink tea and coffee. I've been bitterly depressed for the last 6 months because of the things she's told me - comparing me to korihor, telling me I've lost the spirit and that's why I'm depressed, that I've thrown away my family, etc. If you can imagine it, she's said it. She won't listen to a single word from me about my experience and instead just says I'm deceived because I listened to ""anti-mormon crap"" (for the record, my experience with any anti material was the gospel topic essays, which are a pretty solid refutation of the church's truth claims, and the fucking news). Meanwhile, she goes to the temple twice a month now, when we never went more than one per year.  Doubled down doesn't even begin to describe her response to my leaving. 

I don't need her to leave the church. I just want her to validate my path. I don't want to be married to someone I can't openly share my feelings about a corporation, Church, worldview, etc. The fucking church stole my family from me, claiming the moral high ground at every turn.

""Everything all right at home?""

""Yeah, it is. Well, Ida's been worried, on account of Ilie's gettin' curious about Christmas stuff.""

""We're doin' okay, Serge. Really.""

The rest of the afternoon passed more quietly, just installing the all-important ""fixtures,"" as Serge called them. Last thing, Serge gave Costin a quick look at the film projector, and right away the machine seemed intriguing.

""Well, Serge, I dunno as I wanna go into business or whatnot, but I believe I could help you out with this beauty if it ever gives ya trouble.""

Serge grinned.

""That's what I like to hear, Cost. Just what I like to hear.""

Heading home, Costin arrived at the end of their street around the usual time, and sure enough he found Ilie waiting for him. Smiling, he grabbed the boy up and hugged him.

""How's my favourite son?""

""Papa, I'm your *only* son.""

""So you are. Come on, let's get home.""

They went into the building by the front door, stopping to talk to Isaac Feinman.

""Well, Costin,"" the grocer said, ""Ilie. What can I do for you?""

""Need a pound of coffee,"" Costin nodded, ""and I was wondering if you got maybe cornmeal?""

""Do I got cornmeal? Costin, I got cornmeal almost coming out my ears.""

Little Ilie, engrossed in studying the bolts of cloth behind Feinman's counter, made a little disgusted sound at the comment, and the two grown men laughed to themselves.

Once the items had been handed over, Isaac smiled.

""Everything is well for your family, I presume?"" he murmured to Costin.

""All well. You?""

""We're all well. Jimmy's much better. Hey, Ilie! Ilie, here, have this.""

Isaac handed the boy some sticks of barley candy. They were quickly accepted and shoved into a coat pocket, and Costin nudged his son's shoulder.

""Whatta we say?""

""Thank you, Mr. Feinman.""

Isaac laughed.

""He's a good lad, Costin. A good lad.""

They took their leave then, allowed passage through the door behind the counter to climb the stairs to the fourth floor from there. All the way, Ilie was laughing, telling Costin some silly jokes he had learned at school that day, singing hints of songs. Once, he tried to unwrap some of his candy, but his papa stopped him.

""Your mama'd have my head if I let you spoil your dinner, son.""

# How Does Java Burn Works?

As stated, this product is derived from entirely natural components recognized for their appetite-suppressing and metabolism-boosting properties. When you blend Java Burn Fat Burner with your morning coffee, the caffeine present in the beverage not only elevates your energy levels but also initiates thermogenesis.

This metabolic process is crucial as it prompts your body to utilize stored fats as fuel instead of relying on carbohydrates or sugars for energy, a departure from the typical scenario when exercise is lacking or the diet is not optimal.

  
Additionally, the presence of green tea extract, chlorogenic acid, and caffeine serves to ramp up metabolic activity, offering weight loss advantages while sustaining a productive lifestyle.

  
Remarkably, this product operates without necessitating lifestyle changes or dietary alterations. Many users have reported shedding 5 lbs within just a week, a significant reduction in excess fat without the imposition of strict dietary restrictions. Considering that these individuals did not have to adhere to a rigorous diet regimen, the outcomes are notably swift.

We have a 2024 XLE and I am so annoyed by how bad the remote start is. Here are my complaints:

1. App sucks. I usually use the fob to start because the app fails like 40% of the time.
2. Car turns off when you unlock the doors! So when I have my kids with me (specifically the one year old) I have to put him down in the front seat for a second while I restart the car, or else I am buckling him into his car seat while the van is getting colder, not warmer.
3. You can't lock the car with the fob outside the car. So when I restart the car, which is already annoying, I can't lock the kids in the car to run back inside for bags, the dog, my coffee, whatever my toddler forgot and now desperately NEEDS. Or if I wanted to go out and start the car and turn on the heat (see point 4), I can't lock the doors when I come back inside.
4. Heat/seat warmers don't come on automatically. In my Grand Cherokee (2014 Laredo, so nothing especially new or fancy), when it's <40¬∞ and you remote start, the heat and seat warmers and front defroster automatically come on full blast. Sienna just seems to come on whatever the setting were when you got out last.

I have only been on creatine for a week, am I ready to start injecting it or will this cause an overdose? I look forward to your replies. ",2,1735397134.0,Creatine,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been out of the church for many years, and my parents beliefs have become a bit more tame over the years, but people in my family, who I should mention are not really adventist or super religious still continue to be shocked and question my normal life decisions. Decisions in terms of getting piercings, drinking, church attendance, dating, clothing choices etc. Also, by question I mean like ‚Äúwere your parents mad at you when you got your piercings‚Äù? Or like ‚Äúwhat do you mean you don‚Äôt go to church? Your parents don‚Äôt force you‚Äù? Or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre drinking in front of your parents‚Äù? I was used to this kind of treatment at first, and definitely kinda expected it, but now it‚Äôs definitely getting out of hand especially now that I am 28 years old. 

For example, I was making coffee yesterday morning during brunch and one of my aunts was genuinely shocked that I was drinking coffee as she assumed it was ‚Äúfake‚Äù or decaffeinated coffee. Also, the fact that I mentioned that I wasn‚Äôt planning on going to church with my parents and the rest of my family this morning had my cousins shocked as they still believed that at age 28, my parents still forced me to go to church and that I would oblige.
I just want to be seen as a normal 28 year old, who has agency and not one that still follows the demands and teachings of what my parents / the adventist religion demanded when I was a child, but it‚Äôs super annoying that people still hold me to those standards and get shocked and question me when I don‚Äôt follow. Also since I mentioned above that my parents beliefs have changed over time, so they genuinely don‚Äôt care about what I do anymore and don‚Äôt force their beliefs on me (which I am grateful for), but people outside just don‚Äôt see it this way, and still ask me as if I‚Äôm a rebellious teenager which is quite infantilizing in a way.

Just to share a quick story from yesterday, and see if anyone has had a similar experience. 

Me and my partner headed to Starbucks after our monthly Costco shop. This is like our little tradition. I ordered my usual drink - Decaff Caramel Macchiato with Oat Milk, and my partner did the same. Weirdly enough this time, we had to wait 5-6 minutes between the first drink arriving and the second drink arriving. My partner insisted that I took the first one, so I waited until their one arrived, then we took them away with us as we sit and enjoy a view of the countryside with the drinks.

As soon as I had finished my drink, I instantly felt something was wrong. Just this hot, dizzy and nauseous feeling came over me and within 10 minutes I was violently sick, like projectile vomiting my whole coffee at the side of the road. 

We have contacted the branch via email to have this investigated.

1ho6y2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1ho6y2s/christianity_can_have_a_negative_impact_on_our/,Christianity Can Have a Negative Impact on Our Self-Esteem,"Hello! I hope all is well. I am reaching out to the community to discuss the relationship between Christianity and self-esteem.

[Here, I discuss this topic over a cup of coffee if you prefer to engage that way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqbBMtFL1CU). I am focused on creating a community where those who've experienced religious trauma can find hope and support.

Let's get into it.

I believe Christianity can have negative impacts on one's self esteem. Here is what I am not saying:

**I am not saying Christianity is all bad and does no good**

I do not want that to get lost in the noise here. I do believe Christianity can have a positive influence on someone. However, this is not a conversation about the positive impacts of Christianity, it is a conversation about how Christianity may negatively impact the self-esteem of those who profess belief.

They may not even realize how it is impact their self-esteem. You may not see how it is shaping your view of yourself and others. I know I didn't.

Here are my main points:

1. You are in the wrong

Without the above statement being true, we have no need for a tortured savior. If you are not in the wrong, you do not need saved and are right before God and can die in peace. But since we are in the wrong from the Christian perspective, we must accept that some people will internalize this.

Where you may see ""God loves me so much he died for me"" others may see ""am I bad and evil that someone had to be killed for me?""

Both sides of this need to be taken into account. But that's not what I see happening. I see the voices of those with negative impacts being silenced and told they ""are not real Christians""

That only increases the anxiety of those struggling.

2. You deserve hell

In Christianity, the wages of sin is death. Physical and spiritual death. Without Jesus' blood and pain covering your infractions against God, you are left hopelessly destined for eternal torment. But, do not fear, this is what you deserve. This is the correct and proper outcome for the sins weve commited againast God. We do not deserve the gift of grace that Jesus offers, no, what we deserve is to be placed in a state of eternal conscious torment.

Where some people see, ""thank you God for freeing me from what I deserve"" others see ""am I really so wrong I deserve to be burned?""

3. There are no qualms about your destruction, it is celebrated

Not only are we wrong and deserving of hell, but our eternal torment is accompanied by celebratory passages all throughout the bible. God consistently and systematically takes out his enemys one by one throughout the entirery of the bible. And you are on thie hit list if you dont think the right thoughts about Jesus. This can place someone in the constant position of wondering if they've been deceived and are on the path leading to hell. This is only exacerbated by the notion of Satan, the master deceiver, who is prowling around seeking to devour souls.

Conclusion:

I think it is fair to say that belief in such ideals \^ might have a negative consequence on people, particularly if they are taught these things from a young age.

We have activities in our club that are related in serving the church/chapel. After that we will have an after club activity which we will go outside of the university and do the activities that aren't related in the club (ex: eating dinner, go karaoke).

It happened last April, an alumnus was planning for a get together after the club activity. After the club activity, we stayed outside in the office since it was occupied, and the members slowly left. A club officer asked me where will I go and I told him that I don't know where to go (context: I was grieving at that time since I cut off my best friend). So he replied ""there's (name) and (name) over there so you can go talk to them, I will go home now bye"". So I sat with them in silence and I felt numb.
When I went at my dorm, I checked my Instagram. They went out for a coffee. I react a heart on their stories. The club officer removed me on their close friend list and the members and alumni who are involved removed it on their instagram story. It sucks that the ribbon I gave to the freshman gave it to an alumni (context: there's a ribbon activity and I gave them a yellow ribbon that means I want to be friends with them). So I cried a couple of hours till I fall asleep.

The day after there's a meeting for all clubs in the university, The club officer and I were the representative of the meeting. I tried to be professional and acted being blind of what happened in the situation that same goes with the club officer. After that I poured it all out. Whenever I see their IG stories of their circle or someone who would mention on their other group chat, I would somehow reminisce that have happened last April.

At this point I do not know if they are my friends. Whenever I am with them in serving the masses, I feel hurt and would act as if I am okay.

There is danger in dialoging too much with a Terminal Monologer. He has to be the funniest person in the room. And it is genuinely funny. I laughed a lot and immediately felt terrible because it was coming from the mouth of a (pick one): rapist, debaser, sadist, mooch, manipulator, duvet snatcher, philosophy 2200 megalomaniac.

While pooping, three people come and try to get in.

With the doors closed, the bathrooms never have a chance to dry. The floor mat and towels are always wet.

This could all be solved by simply not closing the door when exiting the bathroom.

1ho6lh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenNoCensor/comments/1ho6lh4/why_is_this_girl_acting_like_that/,Why is this girl acting like that?,"First of all:

1-English is not my mother tongue. I understand you perfectly, no problem with that...but I apologize if I make some grammar or vocabulary mistakes.

2-I don't want to come across as arrogant. I'm no model or perfect guy. If I say I perceive a girl is attracted towards me is because of her attitude. Please don't interpret that as arrogance.

Here's a work colleague of mine, let's cal her Jennifer; 24F (I'm 29M), who I was not friends with, just a good relationship at work but we were not part of the same rota so we didn't see each other a lot. Anyway, it was just a normal relationship like with many of my female coworkers. I worked at the airport and at my job 90% or even more are women. 

I quit that job last year and I've no contact with most of my colleagues anymore, only whose who I was most close to because we worked together for years or because we were part of the same rotation.

I don't use IG a lot but in November I posted some photos of mine, some of which I was complimented about by some friends. One day Jennifer sends me a WhatsApp. 

\-Hey Alex, how are you? How are things going? I saw some photos you posted and I said ""ohh Alex it's been a long time"". 

I replied everything okay, I asked if she was still working at the airport, if everything was okay...we chatted a little bit but I never said anything about having a coffee or anything like that...I just kept it ""civil"".

This is weird because right after I posted some photos she contacted me. Also, we were not that close for her to ask me how I was doing; so my conclusion was that she likes me and she wanted me to ask her out or chat with her more often or whatever. HOWEVER, there's also the possibility that she just wanted to know about my life to tell other colleagues. I mean, Ik now that environment and gossip and bitching was too much. Everyone wanted to know about everyone else's lives. And yes, men were the first to bitch and gossip too; but again, my work colleagues were 95% female.

Thing is, I've noticed that Jennifer is repeating what I do. If I post a story with my little cousin, she posts a photo with a baby or similar the next day. I posted a pic of my car after I washed it, she posted a photo washing her car a couple days later. Now by Christmas a post with some stuff I was gifted: a pair of shoes, a ring and some clothes, brand Lacoste. Yesterday she posts some old photos of her trip to Italy but she poses in a way that shows clearly that she's wearing a handbag brand Lacoste. 

  
Is this a dead giveaway? Can you like someone you haven't talked to in the last 14 months or so?  I've noticed this pattern in other women I've met....When they liked me they even feigned hobbies or things just because I had those hobbies or I liked something. Like a way of getting my approval. Maybe you don't realize as you do it unconsciously but it's pretty obvious this girl is acting in a weird way.

Wife blames me for taking her to the hospital after a psychosis.,"I don‚Äôt want to add too much detail, since the story is complicated. But long story short, she experienced rapidly intensifying psychosis over a night (I didn‚Äôt realize this was an increasingly serious situation for months) and I thought she was at least somewhat better by the morning. I had put off calling an ambulance that night. I left her at a nearby cafe after having coffee, where she could work on her projects. I parted ways to work at home and thought she‚Äôd be fine. Worst case scenario, I thought, she might erupt at the cafe but there were many people or cops would show up. I didn‚Äôt expect what followed.

Fast forward, an ambulance comes to get her after someone sees her on the street acting erratically and calls an ambulance. I get a call from the EMT, show up and we go to the ER. After an evaluation (I didn‚Äôt even know how these things worked at the time), she is admitted inpatient for a week.

The signs had been growing over some months. I only ever showed her love, although we had our issues, as any couple does. We‚Äôve been together 10 years. She thinks I‚Äôm a good person, but is hurt that I was either in her eyes unwilling or unable to calm her down. 

I accept that our habits as a couple may have played a role, but I also know that other stressors were the main factor. We‚Äôve overall had a great relationship. 

This is just her second week out of the hospital. Thoughts?

Dubai is my hometown and I love it to death and don‚Äôt want to leave but dating here is extremely frustrating, and im tired of constantly losing time to those who aren‚Äôt serious about dating.

I work as a senior account manager at a PR agency. I workout 5x a week - love strength training, pilates and yoga. I can definitely squat over 70kgs (and put some men to shame with a 130kg+ deadlift/hip thrust pb) but also look like I like a cookie or two. 

I‚Äôm funny, intelligent and kind and think those are the three biggest traits that could make or break a relationship. 

I‚Äôm getting older and I want something more meaningful - and I‚Äôm ready to put in the legwork to make something beautiful with someone else. When I‚Äôm not working or working out - I spend time with my family, raving (I love techno), travelling the world and reading. I also loooove cooking and eating cheesecakes from multiple eateries in the city (hence the cookie lover physique).

When you download it, make sure to visit the settings and complete your profile so you get more surveys. Also, tap on ""Notifications"" and enable ""short surveys"" and ""long surveys"". For Notification Frequency, tap ""As many as possible"". You can also enter the code ""tnuku"" as an invitation code in the settings to start with a small bonus :)

I was invited to a coffee date. Catching up with friends. I was looking forward to that.

Today is the day that I should meet them. Guess what? They proceeded differently, no one informed me.

They are now in a sleepover. Without me. Without informing me, even as courtesy. Nothing.

I heard one of their friends is invited and we‚Äôre not close enough for her to be comfortable around me. And they chose her üòÇüòÇ. Cute, right? 

I will never be that kind of person that worth to choose, no?",0,1735395246.0,self,2,0.4,False

It always started with some erotic, romantic sexting. After working out, I would get dressed up and head over to your Pleasure Palace. You would have fresh flowers and yummy food laid out. We'd smoke weed and then fool around in the hot tub, then have amazing, passionate sex. After that, we would head downstairs and cook up some food. Most of the time I would beat you in a game of dominoes before our early bedtime. Sunday mornings were sweet. We would hang out on the sofa with me drinking coffee and you drinking tea. It was nice. Too bad you ruined everything with your lies and your cheating. I understand now why you have maintained a connection to that worn-out, illiterate, trashy, west Texas Road Whore. You need somebody to crap on just so you can feel good about yourself. Go to Hell.",0,1735395203.0,UnsentLettersRaw,0,0.5,False
