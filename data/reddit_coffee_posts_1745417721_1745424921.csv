1k634t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1k634t5/i_just_had_a_baby_and_i_am_so_bored/,I just had a baby and I am so bored,"My husband and I had a beautiful baby girl 3 weeks ago. It was a birth story like in the movies, but a very uncomplicated vaginal delivery. So recovery has been very smooth, apart from some soreness down below and stinging when I pee. But that‚Äôs 95% gone now so I feel basically back to myself. And honestly, I‚Äôve felt pretty good a day or so after giving birth. 

I am on maternity leave and will be for a year. I love my job and love working, so I really miss work. 

My husband is also home all the time (he‚Äôs on parental leave but also his job is WFH anyways). So it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs only me home while he gets to go out. We are BOTH home all day everyday and both taking care of our child and doing chores equally. 

We do go on a walk around the neighborhood once a day. 

But I just want to get out of the house and go to a cafe or walk around the mall or just something that isn‚Äôt staying in my house and going for a walk once a day. 

Before she was born, my husband and I use to go for a walk to a cafe and have a coffee once a week. This was the highlight of my week and I loved it. It‚Äôs a long walk (40 minutes each way) but was so nice. 

Yesterday, I went to get my haircut in the morning and then picked up some breakfast and coffee at a cafe for my husband and I. I really enjoyed this little outing. 

I don‚Äôt mind taking the baby with me. It has nothing to do with being away from the baby. It‚Äôs more just I want to be out of the house. 

I told my husband I would like for us and the baby to go to a cafe and get a coffee. But he‚Äôs quite nervous to do this. He‚Äôs a bit more practical than me maybe. What if the baby needs to be changed? What if she fusses? What if she cries? (That‚Äôs what‚Äôs going through his head). I understand where he‚Äôs coming from. And she also hasn‚Äôt been vaccinated yet, which I am a bit nervous for. 

My husband said his parents can watch the baby while we go out to dinner. But I would also feel bad about asking someone else to watch a newborn baby, who is unpredictable and would either spend 3 hours fast asleep not making a peep or 3 hours crying. I also kind of want to do something as a family. 

We don‚Äôt have any friends in this town, so going out to lunch with a friend while hubby stays at home with the baby isn‚Äôt practical. My friends live a minimum of an hour away and it is very hard to organize things with them. They haven‚Äôt even met the baby yet (this is because every single one has had a cold). 

Any other new moms feel like this? What did you do to get out of the house? Did you take your newborn baby with you? How did you deal with scenarios like needing to be changed or crying? I breastfeed but I also pump so we would be using bottles to feed the baby when not at home.

1k634ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Famous-Discipline916/comments/1k634ca/i_think_sugar_is_making_my_pcos_worse/,I think Sugar is making my PCOS worse?,"**Understanding PCOS**

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is more than just a hormonal issue‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-body condition that disrupts how your hormones function. While commonly associated with irregular periods, PCOS also leads to higher levels of androgens (often called ‚Äúmale hormones,‚Äù but present in everyone), which can trigger symptoms like facial hair growth, acne, hair loss on the scalp, and unpredictable menstrual cycles.

But that‚Äôs just one side of it. PCOS also increases the risk of metabolic complications such as weight gain, elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, and insulin resistance, which may contribute to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular issues.

**The Sugar-PCOS Connection**

Many people are unaware of how closely sugar and PCOS are linked. One of the primary features of PCOS is insulin resistance. When you consume sugar‚Äîespecially in the form of sugary beverages or processed foods‚Äîyour blood sugar spikes, and your body releases insulin in response. However, in PCOS, your cells don‚Äôt respond properly to insulin, leading to an overload in the bloodstream.

This excess insulin stimulates the ovaries to produce more androgens, which worsens hormonal imbalance and PCOS symptoms. The result? A vicious cycle where sugar fuels insulin resistance, which in turn exacerbates PCOS.

**How Sugar Affects Menstrual Cycles and Fertility**

When insulin levels are chronically high due to sugar intake, it disrupts the normal hormonal signals that regulate ovulation. This can lead to irregular or missed periods, making conception more difficult.

In short, a high-sugar diet can worsen insulin resistance and throw hormone levels off balance, interfering with both your cycle and fertility.

**Sugar and Inflammation in PCOS**

There‚Äôs a strong link between sugar and inflammation, especially in those with PCOS. Excess sugar can lead to the accumulation of visceral fat around the abdomen, which is notorious for releasing inflammatory chemicals (cytokines). This inflammation can contribute to bloating, joint pain, acne, and further disrupt hormone balance.

Hormonal acne, especially along the jawline and chin, is often driven by insulin spikes and increased androgen levels, both worsened by high sugar intake. Similarly, elevated androgens can shrink hair follicles, leading to scalp hair thinning while increasing unwanted facial or body hair.

**Reducing Sugar: Real Benefits**

Cutting back on sugar has clear and measurable benefits for PCOS:

* **Improved Insulin Sensitivity**: Research in *The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism* found that reducing sugar intake improved insulin sensitivity by 20‚Äì25% in just a few weeks.
* **Lower Inflammation**: *The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* showed that reducing added sugars led to a 30% drop in CRP, a key marker of inflammation, in about 10 weeks.
* **Better Weight Management**: A study in *Obesity* showed participants on a low-sugar diet lost an average of 5% of their body weight over six months‚Äîhelpful for managing PCOS symptoms.

**Simple Swaps to Cut Sugar**

You don‚Äôt have to go cold turkey. Start gradually:

* **Replace sugary drinks** with herbal teas, sparkling water, or black coffee.
* **Snack smarter** with nuts, seeds, berries, or veggies instead of processed sweets.
* **Cook from scratch** to avoid hidden sugars in packaged foods, sauces, and dressings.
* **Rethink breakfast**‚Äîditch sugary cereals and go for eggs or plain Greek yogurt.
* **Watch portion sizes** if you‚Äôre indulging in something sweet.
* **Add more protein and fiber** throughout the day to curb cravings and stabilize blood sugar.

**Long-Term Gains**

A low-sugar lifestyle doesn‚Äôt just help with PCOS‚Äîit boosts overall well-being. Many people report better mood stability and less fatigue once they reduce sugar intake. More balanced blood sugar = more balanced hormones = fewer mood swings and energy crashes.

If you're managing PCOS, reducing sugar could be a game changer for your hormones, your cycle, and your long-term health.

It was completely dark where I was. A drop of moisture had pulled me out of sleep. I stretched out my arms, but they were quickly stopped by wood. I pushed harder, but nothing happened. I was clearly stuck inside this wooden thing.

I fumbled around, trying to find where the moisture had come from. With a bit of luck, I managed to locate the spot where water had seeped in, and I began pushing against the wood, which was softer there. The wood split, and some dirt fell onto me.

I slipped in that direction, through the soil. It was difficult, but after some time, I finally saw a glimmer of light above me. I continued my way through the damp earth. At last, the sun touched me. I took a deep breath of CO‚ÇÇ and stretched out my leaves to capture those precious rays.

As I looked around, I realized it wasn't sunlight shining down on me.

The light had a strange quality. Too steady, too white. It didn't really warm me. I lifted my leaves toward it, uncertain. All around me, the ground was contained, framed by slightly foggy glass walls. The air was thick with moisture, saturated with a steady, lukewarm heat.

I wasn't in a forest. Nor in a field. I was somewhere else.

I couldn't sense the roots of others around me. There was an unusual silence. No wind. No insects. No rustling. Only this strange artificial smell, a mix of fertilizer, plastic, and metal.

I reached a leaf in one direction, then another. Beyond the glass, a silhouette passed by. Tall, bipedal. A human. They stopped for a moment and approached. Their face was hidden behind a transparent shield. They scribbled something on a tablet, then walked away.

I had been born in a greenhouse. But I wasn't an ordinary plant.

Days passed, or maybe hours. It was hard to tell under such frozen light. I got used to this world without wind, without sky, without rain. My roots stretched carefully through the warm soil, but soon I hit a barrier. A material I didn't know.

Then one morning, something changed.

A high-pitched chime sounded, followed by heavy footsteps. Muffled voices. The greenhouse door creaked open, and the human returned, this time not alone. Another biped walked beside them, smaller, hunched, with hair as white as the clouds I had never seen.

He came closer slowly. His eyes squinted behind small square glasses. He knelt before me, extended a wrinkled hand, and brushed the tip of one of my leaves.

They spoke to each other, then the other human nodded and tapped their tablet. An agreement had been made. Then, with surprising gentleness, they lifted me from the table where I had been growing.

I felt no pain, no fear. Just a quiet worry about what might come next.

They wrapped me in crinkly plastic and carried me out of the greenhouse. The air outside felt different. Cooler. More alive. Noises, smells, unsettling vibrations.

I was placed in the back of a vehicle. A car, I think. It smelled of dust, worn leather, and a strange nostalgia. The old man sat at the wheel and started the engine.

The world rushed past me, blurry and fast. The vibrations from the car gently shook my leaves, still folded like they were asleep. I could hear the radio crackling.

Then finally, the car stopped.

The sky, the real sky, welcomed me. Vast, ever-changing, infinite. Clouds drifted slowly overhead. The wind touched me for the first time, and I shivered. I hadn't expected the wind to be so strong. The air smelled of living earth, fallen leaves, invisible animals.

The man took me out of the car with the same care he had shown in the greenhouse. He walked along a path lined with old trees, circled a house with a rusted roof, and stopped in front of a wide open yard. As far as the eye could see, a field rippled in the wind. Hills in the distance. A few rusty farm tools.

He dug a hole in a clear spot, at the edge of the field. Not quite in the center, not quite apart.

He planted me gently in the soft soil. Not in a pot. Not in a box. In the ground. The real ground.

He pressed the earth around me carefully, as if searching for something, then murmured as he poured a bit of water

""Come on now, grow for the next generations.""

He stayed a while, sitting near me, silent. Then he stood slowly, walked away, and entered his house, leaving me alone for the first time.

But I wasn't truly alone.

I could feel life all around me.

Beneath the surface, tiny vibrations tickled my roots. Insects, worms, maybe even small mammals, were busy under the soil, stirring the matter, gently aerating the ground. I felt the silky touch of a centipede, then the clumsy beats of a beetle that slipped on a moist clump and scurried away. Another, smaller, paused against one of my roots.

Above ground, ants marched in lines, carrying twigs, avoiding my young shoots with remarkable precision. An aphid climbed up my stem, tasted me, then was swept away by a ladybug.

My first real leaves finally unfolded completely. A fine membrane still linked them to my young buds, but they began absorbing the sun's energy with new eagerness. The sky felt immense, almost dizzying, but also reassuring. I was learning, slowly, to recognize the rhythms of day and night. The rising warmth of morning. The soft breeze of afternoon. The chill of twilight. And in the darkness, the living cold of night.

Each day, my leaves stretched further, my roots dug deeper, branching out, exploring. The soil here wasn't perfect. Sometimes too dry, sometimes too dense. But I liked it just the same.

Birds came. At first, they flew over me without stopping. Then one morning, a chickadee perched briefly on a nearby branch. She looked at me, head tilted, curious. Then flew off. Later, a sparrow landed nearby, pecked an insect at my base, then left singing.

I didn't yet understand everything happening around me. I was discovering.

Spring welcomed me like a fresh breath. Each day brought more light, more warmth. The ground slowly warmed up, rains came often, sometimes violent, but always welcome. My buds swelled, burst into broader, sturdier leaves. Around me, grass grew taller, insects buzzed, birds returned with their morning songs.

Summer, hot and wide, brought my first real challenge. The sun beat down so hard that my leaves sometimes curled at noon to preserve water. But I held firm. My roots, now deeper, sought moisture below when the surface dried. That's when I discovered something strange. Deep down, the earth wasn't just nourishing. It also held memories. Remains of old roots, dead wood, forgotten stones.

Autumn was a bittersweet season. I felt the light wane, days grow shorter, the air cool. My leaves changed color, from bright green to pale yellow tinged with ochre. I learned to pull back a little, to slow my growth, to store my strength. Birds still passed by, but quicker, quieter. The old man would sometimes sit near me, a book on his lap, or just watching the hills.

Winter, at last, nearly put me to sleep. The cold froze the surface, but deep down, the earth remained warm. I drew back my sap, closed my pores, let my leaves fall one by one. It wasn't death, no. Just a pause. A slow breath, a waiting. Snow covered me, protected me. Winter silence was total. But underground, my roots still moved, imperceptibly, like curious fingers.

Then spring returned. And with it, light. Energy. Drive. And so the cycle of seasons continued.

Each year, I grew a little more. My trunk thickened, my branches multiplied, my leaves formed a gentle canopy. Birds came back for good, made their nests. Insects buzzed from dawn to dusk. Even a squirrel climbed me one day, leaving small scratches on a young branch.

And always, the old man came. Less often, more slowly.

One day, the old man didn't come back.

The wind waited. So did the sun. Days passed, and the rusty chair remained empty. The house felt even quieter, shutters closed, the garden overgrown.

Then one morning, new sounds arrived.

An engine, sharp. Young voices, lively. Slamming doors. Quick footsteps. It felt like excited birds discovering a new land.

People had moved into the house. It was a young couple.

They walked past me without really noticing at first, too busy carrying boxes, painting walls, cleaning dusty windows. But soon, they began to explore more attentively. One morning, the woman walked to the field, a steaming mug in hand, and stopped in front of me. She looked at me for a long time, then came closer and placed her hand on my trunk.

""Look at this,"" she said. ""It's younger than the other trees. I wonder who planted it.""

He shrugged, holding a hammer.

""A memory, maybe. It's well placed. We could put a bench right next to it.""

A few days later, the man came out of his workshop with an old white wooden bench, a bit wobbly but charming, and set it at my base. They often came to drink their morning coffee there. Sometimes they read. Sometimes they said nothing at all. Sometimes they laughed loudly. Sometimes they cried softly.

I kept growing. My trunk thickened, my crown spread. The shade I cast was now larger and cooler. The birds had truly returned. Chickadees, blackbirds, even a hawk soaring above the field.

And every spring, when my buds opened once more, I remembered.

The first darkness. The strange light. The greenhouse. The wrinkled hand. The journey. The field. The man who had planted me and whispered

""Grow for the next generations.""

And I did. For them. For him. For me.

1k62u9a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k62u9a,And if I told you... that the librarian... is It the FATHER (or something like that)!?,"Yes, I know. You now think I'm crazy and I'm talking nonsense for saying. But think and hear that this gets serious.

During the game nothing tells us very well who we are, what we want or what we do there. We can only make assumptions about what is happening or what happened before by the clues they give us, and from there come very crazy theories.

But there are two theories that stand out among the others: The heir is the mother or is it a past/future life of us, the previous ruin seeker who failed, made the bad ending.

The fact is that we intuit that he has a relationship with us both because of his peculiar name and because of his very similar appearance. But... What if we change our focus?

Remember the customization room? The one behind some trees in a hidden room that allowed the fox to change the color of different parts of its body, and that also had a chest with a coin of those used to make wishes.

Well, as if that were not enough, you will remember that there is another room more hidden within the hidden room. It's another changing table, but this one ADDS a new customizable body part: a mohawk/strand of hair. 

And now some of you may already know where I'm going... Doesn't this crest remind you of something? OR SOMEONE?

Yes. I'm talking about the librarian, one of the few enemies who is a fox (the only one alive), and who has this peculiarity in his design.

Chance? I'm sure that's what some of you think. I don't think so. Also, it seems as if he doesn't really want us to do badly, but knows what will happen to us if we free the heir and wants to get the pages of the manual to give help to a suitable ruin seeker. 
In addition, if you beat him, he appears later in his armchair and helps you a little to know what you have to do. And most beautiful of all, he wishes you GOOD LUCK. 

We could also add the fact that he knows the nature of his universe, that they live inside a video game, which could help us empathize with the fact that he knows that you will revive if you don't manage to defeat him, so he wouldn't be doing something BAD actually.

I have also noticed that the library itself is very difficult to reach, it is one of the most difficult of the three gems without a doubt in terms of finding it. And in the library itself there are no enemies, there's just the ADORABLE robot coffee table and that's it. And there's a save point next to the boss-fight that he himself put there.

My wife came out to me after the fact, and now lives her life being her authentic self. However, we live in a very red county. 

Moved to a rural area with bigger cities near by, so I have a 45 minute commute to the most progressive area in the state, which is not bad but I just wish I had a community closer that didn't judge my wife and I for for being queer. I have friends who all live in the progressive city, but the commute makes it difficult to have a ton of gatherings. 

I work from home with 3- sometimes 4 when I babysit the neighbors kid -kids and my wife gets to go to work to a job she really enjoys 4-5 days a week in the progressive city, talking to adults, making friends, going out and I'm just here.. working on my garden and talking to kids and plants all day everyday. 

It also really doesn't help that I still don't drive but that's in the works, and I'll be able to experience a little bit of freedom, but it's just not the same. I miss hosting. I miss meals with friends, cute fancy drinks to make, making the little things special for get togethers. I miss talking to adults. Having coffee with adults.. I miss the social butterfly I used to be. I miss my friends. I miss the outside world. 

I've had several attempts to make friends here. The closest thing I have to a social life here is small talk with my neighbors every once in awhile. Most people when they find out about our little queer family just ghost me here. I have yet to make 1 motherfucking friend here and it's quite embarrassing, honestly. I feel defected. 

I also feel like I'm just piggy-backing on the friends my wife makes here and I'm not finding anyone I truly connect with, so I feel double defected. What is wrong with me? ",2,1745423992.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False
1k62su3,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1k62su3/my_short_story_willow_i_wonder_if_its_good_or/,"My short story ""willow"". I wonder if it's good or boring?","I had just woken up. It was completely dark where I was. A drop of moisture had pulled me out of sleep. I stretched out my arms, but they were quickly stopped by wood. I pushed harder, but nothing happened. I was clearly stuck inside this wooden thing.

I fumbled around, trying to find where the moisture had come from. With a bit of luck, I managed to locate the spot where water had seeped in, and I began pushing against the wood, which was softer there. The wood split, and some dirt fell onto me.

I slipped in that direction, through the soil. It was difficult, but after some time, I finally saw a glimmer of light above me. I continued my way through the damp earth. At last, the sun touched me. I took a deep breath of CO‚ÇÇ and stretched out my leaves to capture those precious rays.

As I looked around, I realized it wasn't sunlight shining down on me.

The light had a strange quality. Too steady, too white. It didn't really warm me. I lifted my leaves toward it, uncertain. All around me, the ground was contained, framed by slightly foggy glass walls. The air was thick with moisture, saturated with a steady, lukewarm heat.

I wasn't in a forest. Nor in a field. I was somewhere else.

I couldn't sense the roots of others around me. There was an unusual silence. No wind. No insects. No rustling. Only this strange artificial smell, a mix of fertilizer, plastic, and metal.

I reached a leaf in one direction, then another. Beyond the glass, a silhouette passed by. Tall, bipedal. A human. They stopped for a moment and approached. Their face was hidden behind a transparent shield. They scribbled something on a tablet, then walked away.

I had been born in a greenhouse. But I wasn't an ordinary plant.

Days passed, or maybe hours. It was hard to tell under such frozen light. I got used to this world without wind, without sky, without rain. My roots stretched carefully through the warm soil, but soon I hit a barrier. A material I didn't know.

Then one morning, something changed.

A high-pitched chime sounded, followed by heavy footsteps. Muffled voices. The greenhouse door creaked open, and the human returned, this time not alone. Another biped walked beside them, smaller, hunched, with hair as white as the clouds I had never seen.

He came closer slowly. His eyes squinted behind small square glasses. He knelt before me, extended a wrinkled hand, and brushed the tip of one of my leaves.

They spoke to each other, then the other human nodded and tapped their tablet. An agreement had been made. Then, with surprising gentleness, they lifted me from the table where I had been growing.

I felt no pain, no fear. Just a quiet worry about what might come next.

They wrapped me in crinkly plastic and carried me out of the greenhouse. The air outside felt different. Cooler. More alive. Noises, smells, unsettling vibrations.

I was placed in the back of a vehicle. A car, I think. It smelled of dust, worn leather, and a strange nostalgia. The old man sat at the wheel and started the engine.

The world rushed past me, blurry and fast. The vibrations from the car gently shook my leaves, still folded like they were asleep. I could hear the radio crackling.

Then finally, the car stopped.

The sky, the real sky, welcomed me. Vast, ever-changing, infinite. Clouds drifted slowly overhead. The wind touched me for the first time, and I shivered. I hadn't expected the wind to be so strong. The air smelled of living earth, fallen leaves, invisible animals.

The man took me out of the car with the same care he had shown in the greenhouse. He walked along a path lined with old trees, circled a house with a rusted roof, and stopped in front of a wide open yard. As far as the eye could see, a field rippled in the wind. Hills in the distance. A few rusty farm tools.

He dug a hole in a clear spot, at the edge of the field. Not quite in the center, not quite apart.

He planted me gently in the soft soil. Not in a pot. Not in a box. In the ground. The real ground.

He pressed the earth around me carefully, as if searching for something, then murmured as he poured a bit of water

""Come on now, grow for the next generations.""

He stayed a while, sitting near me, silent. Then he stood slowly, walked away, and entered his house, leaving me alone for the first time.

But I wasn't truly alone.

I could feel life all around me.

Beneath the surface, tiny vibrations tickled my roots. Insects, worms, maybe even small mammals, were busy under the soil, stirring the matter, gently aerating the ground. I felt the silky touch of a centipede, then the clumsy beats of a beetle that slipped on a moist clump and scurried away. Another, smaller, paused against one of my roots.

Above ground, ants marched in lines, carrying twigs, avoiding my young shoots with remarkable precision. An aphid climbed up my stem, tasted me, then was swept away by a ladybug.

My first real leaves finally unfolded completely. A fine membrane still linked them to my young buds, but they began absorbing the sun's energy with new eagerness. The sky felt immense, almost dizzying, but also reassuring. I was learning, slowly, to recognize the rhythms of day and night. The rising warmth of morning. The soft breeze of afternoon. The chill of twilight. And in the darkness, the living cold of night.

Each day, my leaves stretched further, my roots dug deeper, branching out, exploring. The soil here wasn't perfect. Sometimes too dry, sometimes too dense. But I liked it just the same.

Birds came. At first, they flew over me without stopping. Then one morning, a chickadee perched briefly on a nearby branch. She looked at me, head tilted, curious. Then flew off. Later, a sparrow landed nearby, pecked an insect at my base, then left singing.

I didn't yet understand everything happening around me. I was discovering.

Spring welcomed me like a fresh breath. Each day brought more light, more warmth. The ground slowly warmed up, rains came often, sometimes violent, but always welcome. My buds swelled, burst into broader, sturdier leaves. Around me, grass grew taller, insects buzzed, birds returned with their morning songs.

Summer, hot and wide, brought my first real challenge. The sun beat down so hard that my leaves sometimes curled at noon to preserve water. But I held firm. My roots, now deeper, sought moisture below when the surface dried. That's when I discovered something strange. Deep down, the earth wasn't just nourishing. It also held memories. Remains of old roots, dead wood, forgotten stones.

Autumn was a bittersweet season. I felt the light wane, days grow shorter, the air cool. My leaves changed color, from bright green to pale yellow tinged with ochre. I learned to pull back a little, to slow my growth, to store my strength. Birds still passed by, but quicker, quieter. The old man would sometimes sit near me, a book on his lap, or just watching the hills.

Winter, at last, nearly put me to sleep. The cold froze the surface, but deep down, the earth remained warm. I drew back my sap, closed my pores, let my leaves fall one by one. It wasn't death, no. Just a pause. A slow breath, a waiting. Snow covered me, protected me. Winter silence was total. But underground, my roots still moved, imperceptibly, like curious fingers.

Then spring returned. And with it, light. Energy. Drive. And so the cycle of seasons continued.

Each year, I grew a little more. My trunk thickened, my branches multiplied, my leaves formed a gentle canopy. Birds came back for good, made their nests. Insects buzzed from dawn to dusk. Even a squirrel climbed me one day, leaving small scratches on a young branch.

And always, the old man came. Less often, more slowly.

One day, the old man didn't come back.

The wind waited. So did the sun. Days passed, and the rusty chair remained empty. The house felt even quieter, shutters closed, the garden overgrown.

Then one morning, new sounds arrived.

An engine, sharp. Young voices, lively. Slamming doors. Quick footsteps. It felt like excited birds discovering a new land.

People had moved into the house. It was a young couple.

They walked past me without really noticing at first, too busy carrying boxes, painting walls, cleaning dusty windows. But soon, they began to explore more attentively. One morning, the woman walked to the field, a steaming mug in hand, and stopped in front of me. She looked at me for a long time, then came closer and placed her hand on my trunk.

""Look at this,"" she said. ""It's younger than the other trees. I wonder who planted it.""

He shrugged, holding a hammer.

""A memory, maybe. It's well placed. We could put a bench right next to it.""

A few days later, the man came out of his workshop with an old white wooden bench, a bit wobbly but charming, and set it at my base. They often came to drink their morning coffee there. Sometimes they read. Sometimes they said nothing at all. Sometimes they laughed loudly. Sometimes they cried softly.

I kept growing. My trunk thickened, my crown spread. The shade I cast was now larger and cooler. The birds had truly returned. Chickadees, blackbirds, even a hawk soaring above the field.

And every spring, when my buds opened once more, I remembered.

The first darkness. The strange light. The greenhouse. The wrinkled hand. The journey. The field. The man who had planted me and whispered

""Grow for the next generations.""

And I did. For them. For him. For me.

For the world.",2,1745423989.0,writers,1,1.0,False

I'm going to mention bits of my diet, lifestyle, and personal stats so it can be determined what maybe will help me.
If this isn't the right place, sorry! Please let me know where I could go.

But it pretty much says it in the title, I CAN'T  POOP, and I don't know what the problem is.

Okay obviously I poop, but it's literally like twice a week. A ""good"" poop really only happens once a week at BEST, the rest are just sad clumps.

I am a female, 17, 4'11, and currently weight in at 90.5lbs, but I fluctuate around a bit. I get cardio throughout my day (aiming for 11k steps a day). I slightly train my arms and back with pushups as well.

I make sure to consume atleast 80oz of water a day, and sometimes it's a bit more. And I make sure to get lots of fiber. I aim for 27g, but usually end up over 35g+. 
I make sure to get a considerable amount of fats and protein throughout the day as well (fairly easy).
Most of the fiber products I eat come from FiberOne, but I get a fair amount from the fruits and veggies I eat as well, but mainly the fiber one stuff.
But it just DOESN'T work, it gives me hazardous gas at best, and makes my stomach rumble (not even hurt either, just rumble.) 

I think another important factor I'd like to mention too is that laxatives..BARELY have an effect on me as well, and I'm not trying to over exaggerate.

I've tried magnesium citrate, fiber supplement, coffee, chia seeds, green tea, laxative supplements, milk of magnesium, celcius(which actually does help some days). Just anything you could think of.
For the stuff to actually work, I need like twice the recommended amount on the product, and it doesn't even kick in the same day I take it, it kicks in the next day, at NIGHT. I've even tried starting my day off with fiber or coffee, but no use.I really wish I was just being dramatic, but this seriously happens. 

I'm really hopeless at this point on what to do next for my bowel movements if I've tried almost everything at this point. And it sucks seeing myself get slightly bloated throughout the week, or even waking up bloated or more puffy looking in the morning too. 
Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated, thank you. And once again if this isn't the right sub I deeply apologize.",2,1745423962.0,diet,3,1.0,False

For a lot a the dreams that we have are soon forgotten. Some stay with us, while some are never forgotten, i don‚Äôt really remember the circumstances as to what took place prior to the dream. I only remember setting there in a car some 35 years ago. 

After having a sleepover at a friend‚Äôs house, a friend who I grew up with but have long since lost touch with. It was a quit little town not really hidden away, but if you blink you would certainly miss it. But at the time I can remember telling him all about the dream the next morning. Just as we were heading to the local comic shop I remembered telling him about it. 

For the dream itself didn‚Äôt even seem like a dream, but more like I was looking at a still image. A picture! A picture of a blonde haired girl standing there holding a skateboard. 

A picture that would come to haunt me years later in a way that I would have never felt possible.

For as the years would go by I would all but forget about having the dream until one night when I was living on my own. 

When another dream I would occur, But this dream would be much more darker! With a much more realistic feel to it! 

But I will try to describe it the best way that I can, first to begin with it didn‚Äôt feel like a dream at all! As a feeling of dread was coming over me, of like I wasn‚Äôt alone, but a charged staticky feeling was coming over me. A fear! As i could slowly see flames coming up, and that was when she appeared. 

A blonde haired woman standing in the flames screaming in agony! But as the dream went on it was like her face was changing, but only her face! It was like she was more than one person, made up of different people! But she stayed in white clothing. As she then held up a piece of paper that had something written on it, as she then started pointing to it. 

But as she was pointing to it, she was screaming the words 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it!‚Äù

A feeling of dread then began coming over me! A feeling of

That was when faces of different girls began to appear showing them one by one! showing only certain aspects of their faces! leaving other aspects darkened. 

As if they were faces from a picture not knowing at the time who they were I would really fully never know!

But just as the last face vanished! It showed a group of what seemed to be photos being showed to me with a date on it!  Along with other numbers! From what I can remember the numbers 55, 24, 25, 27, 28 and 29 appeared on the Photos that had something written on them. With the last photo showing a girl in the photo standing there dressed in all in White! 

But a feeling of that in

The Days To Come 

I would find out! One by one!

But for as long as I could remember I had always had a fear over a movie. With the movie being 

‚Äò Carrie‚Äô 

That had came out in 1976. Never really knowing why until I went to see the one that came out in 2013 with 

Chloe Grace Moretz‚Äô

For on that day I would truly understand why I had always had a fear over this movie. That is when it all started! A week or two had gone by with the feeling never leaving me! A feeling that was inside of me that was urging me urging me to write something!

And write something I did! 

A binding contract! The first one! But what I did not know at the time was that many more would follow!

But the strange thing was! When I wrote the first one! It wasn‚Äôt at a specific time like 11:11 or a specific star alignment! Or even during a Blood Moon!

No! It was just random! At around two o‚Äôclock in the afternoon! In a local coffee shop in the town of all places.

But strangely since then the coffee shop has since changed hands several times after! The coffee shop was located in the same small town going by a different name now

But later that night I could remember being forced awake seeing a hand reaching for my face followed with the feeling of something being ripped through my face! Falling to the floor as I found myself grasping for air! 

As the morning would come I found myself at work feeling emotionally drained from life, not from a lack of sleep! For fear didn‚Äôt really set in at the time, for I just went back to sleep after. 

For even though it felt like they took something from me, that night! They still don‚Äôt fully have it, being my soul. For I can still very much feel the presence of God around me. For something still has yet to be decided! Fulfilled! 

But that was when I saw them! Them being the Demons! And of all places at work! Not where I work now, but at a different store. With the first one seeming as if he just suddenly appeared out of nowhere!

But the very first noticeable thing about him was his eyes! With what seemed to be a white light coming from his eyes for a very split second walking a short distance away from me. But oddly enough I could remember I was given his in a dream later on with his name being 

‚ÄúMccoy!‚Äù

And that is when I noticed the second one! Waking towards me! this one a female with a walk that did not seem human even though both  very much looked human from a distance. 

And that is when I looked into her eyes! 

Eyes that one could tell were not that of a human! From up close as the white around her blackened pupils was more like a solid pure pearl white! 

Much more than a human eye color could be making it that every photo that I would see after that. I would only see the person eyes as if I was looking at her eyes! Grinning as she walked by me her looked said it all 

‚Äú You belong to us now‚Äù! 

Just as the male then walked over to me grabbing my hand just as he slid his finger up the palm of my hand with both of them then leaving just as quickly as they came. 

But through the years many more would come And for the next eleven years the dreams would come and go! Dreams showing me the girls that I would write a binding contract on. 

With the dreams also showing me things that they would be doing in a television show or movie! While at the same time opening a door revealing the next girl.

For example in one dream it showed Elizabeth Olsen driving a certain car make and the following day! 

With it showing the exact scene in the TV show. With the television show being WandaVision 

While in the dream showing her getting out of the car walking over to a door opening it up revealing the next girl. 

With another dream, a dream that just did not feel like a dream! A dream showing a possible up coming movie possibly starring the same actress.

It showed a scene of her Elizabeth Olsen standing there in a park like setting wearing clothing that of a park ranger. With her then taking off running followed by three men running after her! 

With the scenery then suddenly changing to showing train tracks going up the side of a mountain. With it then showing what seemed to be an old storage building, when it then showed the actor Benedict Wong

He was walking around in it as he then picked up a note book and a pencil as if he was about to write something down. As he then looked to me like I was to write down what I just saw.

But that was when I woke up but as I was walking to the bathroom I felt different very different! 

For I was waking in Elizabeth Olsen‚Äôs body! I could feel her body all around me as it then just faded away.

But this dream was from two to three years ago!

But just as in the second dream would show different faces!

One by one! 

That I would encounter each of the girls not all of them but some of them Just to show  me that they could until the final one. But from what I remember, but not how or in order that they was written, but that the very first girl was

Kristen Stewart‚Äô 

Then one night while at work, being close to closing time as I approached the end of an aisle.
A girl pushing a shopping cart as then suddenly came around the corner. With the girl being a very famous actress! With actress being 

Miranda Cosgrove‚Äô

While encountering other very famous actresses and a very famous singer at that! With them Jennette Mccurdy‚Äô Elle Fanning‚Äô Avril Lavigne‚Äô ‚Äôand Christina Ricci‚Äô

Even though they were others, I want mention them without being completely sure 

And now back to the second dream! For the paper that the woman in the flames was holding up! what i thought could have been a binding contract! 

May have been something entirely different!

With me now believing to be short stories! Short stories that was sent in to a YouTuber! With the YouTuber being 

Robert Meyer Burnett‚Äô 

for a contest around four years ago. 

For one day while at work, a very famous actress Natalie Portman‚Äô would come in shopping with her family.

With her then asking if we had a product in stock in which we did not at the time. But as she and her family walked away I overheard her say that she liked one of my short stories! a short story that was sent to this YouTuber. 

The short story was titled

 ‚ÄòA place in Heaven‚Äô

While mentioning another short story that included another very famous actress!

Being ‚ÄòAlone‚Äô

Another instance on the short stories happened when two YouTubers one of them being Robert Meyer Burnett‚Äô were talking about upcoming releases from CinemaCon. 

But just as their stream had seemed to end or so they thought had ended. They then started talking between themselves with one of them seemingly not really being to sure of this. For all he heard all day‚Äô 

Was! What about ‚ÄòAbby‚Äô 

But as they talked amongst themselves lasting about a ten seconds about the project that the executives of a certain studio that was interested in it at the time. But for one! I am in no way talking bad about either of these YouTubers.

For if it wasn‚Äôt for Robert Meyer Burnett‚Äô  then Natalie Portman‚Äô would have never even seen that short story. But Remember! What this story is about! The short stories were just a small part of this! 

But the studio that had ‚ÄòAbby‚Äô was Paramount at the time! But that could have changed by now. Or being held for something else.  But at the time it was needed for that reason! Just to show me what they were capable of doing! I mean they were contest stories to begin with! 

But another very famous actress would walk by me! With me over hearing her say that she had been asked about doing ‚ÄòAbby‚Äô That would be great if it happened! While at another time another very famous actress! With her that I also over heard that she was also asked about ‚ÄòAbby‚Äô

And that would be great as well! Two very talented actress‚Äôs that have been possibly asked about doing ‚ÄòAbby‚Äô Actress who I want name. But no matter if anything even comes of these stories, I will always remember a much beloved actress liked my short story

‚ÄòA place in Heaven‚Äô

And now back to the second dream! Just as I then heard a loud crashing noise around me not being able to move! Feeling his arms wrapping around me! Feeling a tongue sliding up and down the side of my face! 

hearing a voice saying 

‚Äú I will rip the flesh from his body‚Äù! 

Just as a second voice then said 

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt dead yet we can‚Äôt take him‚Äù 

the voices began to fade I heard one last thing with on of them saying. 

‚Äú He will become a girl!‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I rip her flesh from her body!‚Äù

35 years later! After the first dream, Just a little over a two years ago while I working around closing time. Standing there at the service desk!When I just happened to look up only to see the girl that was in the photo from the first the first dream. And standing there in front of me was none other than her Dakota Fanning‚Äô

But now since two years have since passed, while at work just I then looked over only to see another very famous actress. Being Elizabeth Olsen‚Äô

As she then walked by me but it wasn‚Äôt until later that I would see one of her very famous sisters! One of the Olsen Twins! standing there in front of me

For One by one! Till the final one! 

With me Never Knowing until the end! Until then I will never know!

But their where occurrence near the beginning and towards the end of this* for I could remember one night ripping up a binding contract! One that was on a set of photos! 

When the next morning came! I went to bathroom setting there on the floor looking up at me. Was the piece of the photo that had the girl‚Äôs name on it. For even if one does rip up a binding contract, if it still remains in your heart! It still remains! 

On a different note! Still belonging very much so with the story itself little over eight years ago while at work.

My pastor Johnny Osborne‚Äô at the time had came in shopping stoping next to me to buy just as he was about to say something to me.

A Laugh I heard! With not only me hearing it but I could see the look in his eyes as I looked to him as he suddenly looked in the direction of the laugh.

It wasn‚Äôt even but a couple of months later that I had heard that he just left! Not only the church! But his family as well.

Never to hear what really happened to him, but from that day on, but I knew in my heart what had happened that day.

For the Demon that laughed was basically letting me know that I was going to go through this on my own 

Along with the dreams came many warnings! One such warning came with a dream, after writing one! One of many! In the dream, I was the girl that I had written on! I was setting in a darkened place along with them in their true form! As they were before falling setting there with me.

When one of them then looked to me as he then placed  his hand on top of my head. saying to me

‚ÄúSo you want to be down here with us!‚Äù

For one night I remember being woken up just as I looked over only to see something scrolling through my phone! At one that was written on my phone. Just as the scrolling then suddenly stopped on her photo! As I then felt a hand smack me on my eye.
 
With the girl in the picture being

Jennifer Lawrence 

But for now another dream I had and in the dream different things it showed me. Not of any celebrities but of things that I would see. And the very next day I would see! For in the dream it showed me two different things that I would see on

YouTube that day.

One of them being a woman in a coat walking and the next was a dollar amount. With both happening in the same video the same woman in the coat and the exact dollar amount that I heard.

But just before the dream had ended I was handed a remote! Meaning that the control of what was to come was now in my control the fate of my soul was now in my hands. 

For since I was young I had always lived my life for Christ! For nothing has been done that cannot be undone, for there is still time for forgiveness to repent. But the day will come when a choice must be made! 

For when I was younger I remember a dream that I had not really remembering what exactly was in the dream 

But also in the dreams it was made very clear to me! That no harm shall come to any of the girls or any other mentioned here. For I am the only one that will be affected by this other than my direct family

But a while back a person would come in wearing a grey hoodie and jeans with their hoodie covering their blonde hair. But strangely enough I could feel who it was, for I could feel it as I Looked up and saw them walking towards me. 

Even though iI know who it was I want say who it was! But as in the dream one by one! And one by one they did! For everyone that was in the dream has come, for a not to long ago, just as I turned an ale the final one walked by me was a very famous actress at that! Wearing sunglasses and a hat! I am not going to mention her name nor am I going to mention another actress here.

For One could say that bending reality is beyond belief. One can also say that this story is beyond belief. Or is it! For if someone was to will something to happen. Could they! For bending reality is to will something to happen In a way that one would never even notice it

For even though this was all true! it only affects me! they are just to many names involved here, to many very big names at that! To share this story for that reason. I guess a story like this would be best just to stay as such! Just a story 

But one last thing the one that I wrote specifically just for Reddit! Being the one with Chloe! Something happened that never happened before! Just as finished one part of it, I was just messing around with it by putting in another time at the top of it from one of the other ones.

When I went to put the photo of her wearing a hoodie on it. The photo just disappeared! It completely vanished before reappearing

But the blonde haired woman who ever she was! That was in the flames was indeed holding up what seemed to be a short story or screen play

But in the end regardless of what happens! I will know what I did lose, and that was my family, my family a wife that had,had enough, spending time with my mom and dad, loosing my home, and worst of all! Missing watching my son growing up! Even though I was there! I was not! That I will know. For until that Day! On that Day! With me and the world Never knowing

I recently completed this book called before the coffee gets cold and there was one short story in it which portrays a woman with a heart disease going through a pregnancy and dieing during the birth. 

This is not about the book though, I mean to say is suppose someone has got a chronic disease from one of their parents and they know in advance that it may pass on to their child. Why do they risk it? 

They would know how hard life is fighting a chronic illness and probably may have seen their elders suffer from the same, then why do they want their own offspring going through that?? 

I discussed this with a few friends, and they told just because they are ill they can't find happiness. I mean no offense but there's a lot of things that may give a person joy rather than giving birth to a human being who has to go through rough times in their near future.

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm 26, and currently going through the toughest financial situation of my life. I owe around $19,000 across 4 credit cards, and 1 of them is already in delinquency (2 months late). My credit score dropped to 587, and I‚Äôm fighting to recover it and pay everything off by the end of the year.

During college, I used credit cards to survive while finishing my degree in Political Science and Economics. Some of that spending was necessary food, gas, bills but, I also used them stupidly for things I didn‚Äôt need. Now, I‚Äôm taking a gap year before applying to law school so I can focus 100% on fixing this financial mess and building a clean slate.


My debts:

Amex: $2,467 | Minimum: $164

Discover: $4,593 | Minimum: $338

Citi: $5,902 | Minimum: $339 (Account closed, in delinquency)

Chase: $6,097 | Minimum: $297


I haven‚Äôt made any payments in 2 months. I want to pay off Amex first, since it‚Äôs the lowest and still open.


My current jobs and income:

Job 1 ‚Äì Coffee Shop (Tourist Zone):

22 hours/week at $5/hr

Tips: ~$80 - $120

One strong day: $100+ in tips


Job 2 ‚Äì Bartender:

2 or 3 days/week, 16+ hours total at $5.50/hr

Tips: ~$150 per day

One strong days: $250+


Total per week (conservative):

$400‚Äì$500 average from both jobs

Some weeks more, depending on tips


Fixed expenses:

Rent: $550

Food: $250 (cutting down aggressively)

Gas: $20 (I drive a 2001 Toyota Corolla)

Phone: $45

Gym: $17

Wilding: $50

Laundry: $40
‚Üí Total monthly: ~$972


Upcoming cash:

Tax return: ~$1,000 (I haven‚Äôt filed yet, I know I‚Äôm late)

Parents might help me with $200/month

I just received a $229 check from Job 1

Another $600 check is pending from my previous Job (My boss is an asshole and he doesn't want to rewrite the check because my dumbass lost it, it's been 3 weeks)

My plan:

I want to work 60+ hours/week. I‚Äôm athletic and healthy, have no medical issues, and plan to sleep 6‚Äì8 hours daily. I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice partying, comfort, and weekends for the rest of the year. 

I already found a nighttime job in the same district I work (waiting tables) that I might take to bring in another $240‚Äì$300/week. I could do that the nights that I'm not bartending Its going to be brutal, but I'm willing to do it.


My main goals:

1. Get out of delinquency ASAP


2. Fix my credit score


3. Pay off all debt by December 2025


4. Survive and stay disciplined


If anyone can help me fine-tune my payoff strategy, offer advice on rebuilding credit fast, or recommend smarter moves, I‚Äôm all ears.

hello,
 its my first ever post on reddit and i would really appreciate some help from you guys
me and my boyfriend, we are together for like 10 years (with some minor break ups etc). we were classmates at med school, he is now 3 year already doctor, and im still studying, bc of mental health problems (narcistic father, serious depressive disorder, anxiety etc). we see each other as often as possible, he works and live around 1 h away, mainly i visit him (during the weekends) , bc he works a lot and i dont want to put more stuff with car driving on him so... i really love him, though he is not my crush type, but when we talk i could listen to him for hours (though im mostly listening.... üòÖ) so as time went we build quite solid relationship, at least i thought...  but lately - speaking of last 2 years its really hard to get him out of his stereotypical zone. I mean his daily routine is wake up late, coffee, shower, get to work, stress at work, get home, coffee and smoking tons of cigarettes and play pc games until he is about to fall asleep on chair....  when im with him we cuddle o lot ofc, but it feels like its not enough for me, and i have a feeling for some time like im just an extra tool to fill some of his emotional needs. i dont know how to express it properly. Simply when he needs it, its ok, but when i need, its less relevant... so i have to adjust all my time and things that im used to do around him. and here begins the problem. He is so used to have me around, and doing all the stuff whenever he wishes, that when i ask for something else/new its too much for him. 
F. e. we argued about open relationship. His sex drive is extremely low, im on antidepressants and still needs sex at least 1xweek. now we have sex around 1xmonth, which is really dyssatisfactory. its always me who initiate sex (mainly blow jobs) , and i feel really terrible, like im pushing him... he always say that he is not in the mood bc of work, but i know he masturbate at least 3x week mainly on muscular guys on twitter. so after some thinking, i suggested open relationship (that does not mean that i want to whore myself out) but his reaction was very violent, either we are monogamous or we break up....  so he doesnt seem to work on sex life, nor he wishes to let me have some fun. my psychologist said that im basicly harming myself, restricting contact with boys (not neccessary sexual), trying to please his ideas of how the ltr should work....   
other things like no common friends, sitting at home for most of the time, literralynwaste of time being there with him, when we are not cuddling or watching tv... 
idk im so fucking depressed and horny at the same time, my life is so fck up... there is so much more, but its so hard to put the thoughts into some understandable way....
 so if you have anything to say, ill be glad to read it... ",0,1745423025.0,AskGaybrosOver30,1,0.5,False

It's sad Breville is about to kill or at least enshittify this brand as well. Buyer beware!

So has soloing EN06 become a little bit annoying. The first time I tried I quit, because I couldn‚Äôt kill it with my normal melee/autoaxe setup. I couldn‚Äôt hit the shield generator with my gatling plasma and EN06 stopped shooting so ricochet couldn‚Äôt do it‚Äòs thing. So after doing no damage to the shield I jumped back to the ground and was shooting from there. But after a while I quit because I know that would take forever with the melee loadout. 

Then I tried the Heavy Gunner method with my vats optimized gatling plasma but I needed two bunkers to kill it. And bringing down the shield took too long in my opinion. I also used a lot more stimpaks than in the attempts before the update and a lot more ammo, at least more than I got back

So after reading into it, I decided to go back to using my autoaxe but then in third-person-view. And that helped a lot. That way I could do damage to the shield generator. But in order to keep AP high I needed too much canned coffee. And since EN06 again stopped shooting, no ricochet could help bring down the shield. So it took almost three minutes until the shield was at less than 1%. 

 But then EN06‚Äòs new trick literally hit me. And it hit me off the platform, so that I finally died before I could autoaxe it. 

Did that happen to anybody else? What are you guys doing now to farm EN06? Besides that, it seems that also XP was nerfed and the infinite button glitch fixed. ",0,1745422717.0,fo76,1,0.2,False

Let me start this review by saying this ‚Äì **PrimeBiome isn‚Äôt just another supplement on the shelf. It‚Äôs a total game-changer.** If you‚Äôve been dealing with gut problems, low energy, bloating, weight gain, or constant fatigue, and you‚Äôve tried everything from diets to detox teas, *this review might just be the best thing you‚Äôve read all year.*

Because I was in your shoes. Tired, sluggish, and frustrated beyond belief.

# My Gut Was a Mess ‚Äì And So Was My Life

For years, I struggled with gut issues. I‚Äôm talking about constant bloating, random stomach cramps, gas, embarrassing bathroom issues, and a stubborn weight that refused to go away no matter how ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù I tried to eat.

Every morning, I would wake up with a heavy stomach. By 2 PM, I needed a nap. My skin was dull, my energy was at rock bottom, and my mental clarity? Non-existent.

I tried probiotics from the drugstore. I tried fiber powders. I even tried eliminating foods like dairy, gluten, and sugar. But nothing worked ‚Äì at least not consistently. And worst of all, I started to believe that this was just ‚Äúhow my body is now.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I discovered **PrimeBiome**.

# What Is PrimeBiome?

PrimeBiome is a **premium gut-health formula** that goes beyond just being a probiotic. It‚Äôs loaded with **high-quality, clinically proven strains of probiotics, prebiotics, digestive enzymes**, and more.

But what makes it truly stand out is this:

>

And the best part? It does all this *naturally*.

# Week-by-Week Experience Using PrimeBiome

Let me break it down so you know exactly what to expect:

# ‚úÖ Week 1 ‚Äì Immediate Relief

Within just 3 days, I noticed that my bloating had drastically reduced. I could eat my favorite foods again without doubling over in discomfort. I wasn‚Äôt running to the bathroom, and for the first time in years, I felt‚Ä¶ *normal*.

It‚Äôs hard to explain how powerful that is unless you‚Äôve lived with daily gut issues. It felt like my body was finally cooperating with me.

# ‚úÖ Week 2 ‚Äì More Energy, Better Sleep

By the second week, my energy was on another level. I didn‚Äôt need coffee to keep my eyes open. I was getting through work with full focus and actually sleeping deeply at night.

Oh, and something I didn‚Äôt expect? **My skin started clearing up.** I wasn‚Äôt even using any new skincare products ‚Äì it was all internal healing from PrimeBiome.

# ‚úÖ Week 3 ‚Äì Slimmer Waistline, Less Cravings

This week was when I really started to *feel* and *see* the weight loss benefits. I wasn‚Äôt bloated, my pants were looser, and I noticed I had way fewer cravings for sugar and carbs.

I later found out this was due to the **balanced gut bacteria PrimeBiome supports**, which helps regulate appetite and hunger hormones.

# ‚úÖ Week 4 ‚Äì Total Body Transformation

By the end of the month, I felt like a brand new person. I had dropped 6 pounds without changing my diet. My digestion was flawless. I wasn‚Äôt bloated at all. My mind was sharper. I was even in a better mood.

And get this ‚Äì people started noticing. Friends asked me if I had started working out (I hadn‚Äôt!). One coworker said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre glowing lately, what are you doing differently?‚Äù

The answer: **PrimeBiome**.

# What‚Äôs Inside PrimeBiome That Makes It So Effective?

Let‚Äôs quickly look at what makes this formula so powerful:

* **11 Proven Strains of Probiotics** (including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) ‚Äì for restoring good gut bacteria
* **Prebiotic Fiber** ‚Äì to feed and support those healthy bacteria
* **Digestive Enzymes** ‚Äì for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients better
* **Zinc, Magnesium & Turmeric** ‚Äì to reduce gut inflammation and improve immunity

It‚Äôs non-GMO, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free, and manufactured in a GMP-certified facility in the USA. That‚Äôs quality you can trust.

# Why PrimeBiome Is Better Than Any Other Probiotic I‚Äôve Tried

I‚Äôve tried 7 different gut health supplements before. Most of them gave me either:

* Zero results
* Temporary relief
* Or worse ‚Äì more bloating

PrimeBiome was different from the start. Why?

1. **It doesn‚Äôt just give you probiotics ‚Äì it gives you the** ***whole system*** (enzymes + prebiotics + gut-healing minerals)
2. **It‚Äôs shelf-stable** ‚Äì no refrigeration needed
3. **It‚Äôs backed by real clinical science**
4. **It actually WORKS** ‚Äì and works fast

# Who Should Try PrimeBiome?

Honestly? If you‚Äôve experienced *any* of the following, PrimeBiome is worth trying ASAP:

* Bloating or gas after meals
* Food intolerances or random stomach pain
* Low energy or constant fatigue
* Mood swings or brain fog
* Difficulty losing weight or stubborn belly fat
* Skin problems like acne or dullness
* Poor sleep or low immunity

Because these are all linked to **an unbalanced gut** ‚Äì and PrimeBiome helps restore it naturally.

# Final Verdict: This Is More Than a Supplement ‚Äì It‚Äôs a Life Upgrade

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling off, bloated, or just not like yourself ‚Äì **PrimeBiome might just be the one thing that transforms your health from the inside out**.

It did for me. I wake up energized. I digest better. I feel lighter. My mind is clearer. And I honestly feel 10 years younger.

I wish I had started using this sooner.

This week was when I really started to *feel* and *see* the weight loss benefits. I wasn‚Äôt bloated, my pants were looser, and I noticed I had way fewer cravings for sugar and carbs.

I later found out this was due to the **balanced gut bacteria PrimeBiome supports**, which helps regulate appetite and hunger hormones.

# ‚úÖ Week 4 ‚Äì Total Body Transformation

By the end of the month, I felt like a brand new person. I had dropped 6 pounds without changing my diet. My digestion was flawless. I wasn‚Äôt bloated at all. My mind was sharper. I was even in a better mood.

And get this ‚Äì people started noticing. Friends asked me if I had started working out (I hadn‚Äôt!). One coworker said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre glowing lately, what are you doing differently?‚Äù

The answer: **PrimeBiome**.

# What‚Äôs Inside PrimeBiome That Makes It So Effective?

Let‚Äôs quickly look at what makes this formula so powerful:

* **11 Proven Strains of Probiotics** (including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) ‚Äì for restoring good gut bacteria
* **Prebiotic Fiber** ‚Äì to feed and support those healthy bacteria
* **Digestive Enzymes** ‚Äì for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients better
* **Zinc, Magnesium & Turmeric** ‚Äì to reduce gut inflammation and improve immunity

It‚Äôs non-GMO, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free, and manufactured in a GMP-certified facility in the USA. That‚Äôs quality you can trust.

# Why PrimeBiome Is Better Than Any Other Probiotic I‚Äôve Tried

I‚Äôve tried 7 different gut health supplements before. Most of them gave me either:

* Zero results
* Temporary relief
* Or worse ‚Äì more bloating

PrimeBiome was different from the start. Why?

1. **It doesn‚Äôt just give you probiotics ‚Äì it gives you the** ***whole system*** (enzymes + prebiotics + gut-healing minerals)
2. **It‚Äôs shelf-stable** ‚Äì no refrigeration needed
3. **It‚Äôs backed by real clinical science**
4. **It actually WORKS** ‚Äì and works fast

# Who Should Try PrimeBiome?

Honestly? If you‚Äôve experienced *any* of the following, PrimeBiome is worth trying ASAP:

* Bloating or gas after meals
* Food intolerances or random stomach pain
* Low energy or constant fatigue
* Mood swings or brain fog
* Difficulty losing weight or stubborn belly fat
* Skin problems like acne or dullness
* Poor sleep or low immunity

Because these are all linked to **an unbalanced gut** ‚Äì and PrimeBiome helps restore it naturally.

# Final Verdict: This Is More Than a Supplement ‚Äì It‚Äôs a Life Upgrade

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling off, bloated, or just not like yourself ‚Äì **PrimeBiome might just be the one thing that transforms your health from the inside out**.

It did for me. I wake up energized. I digest better. I feel lighter. My mind is clearer. And I honestly feel 10 years younger.

I wish I had started using this sooner.

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm 27, living in Puerto Rico, and currently going through the toughest financial situation of my life. I owe around $19,000 across 4 credit cards, and 1 of them is already in delinquency (2 months late). My credit score dropped to 587, and I‚Äôm fighting to recover it and pay everything off by the end of the year.

During college, I used credit cards to survive while finishing my degree in Political Science and Economics. Some of that spending was necessary food, gas, bills but I also used them stupidly for things I didn‚Äôt need. Now, I‚Äôm taking a gap year before applying to law school so I can focus 100% on fixing this financial mess and building a clean slate.

Here‚Äôs my current breakdown:

My debts:

Amex: $2,467 | Minimum: $164

Discover: $4,593 | Minimum: $338

Citi: $5,902 | Minimum: $339 (Account closed, in delinquency)

Chase: $6,097 | Minimum: $297


I haven‚Äôt made any payments in 2 months. I want to pay off Amex first, since it‚Äôs the lowest and still open.


My current jobs and income:

Job 1 ‚Äì Coffee Shop (Tourist Zone):

22 hours/week at $5/hr

Tips: $80, $120 daily

One strong day: $150+ in tips


Job 2 ‚Äì Bartender:

2 or 3 days/week, 16 hours total at $5.50/hr

Tips: ~$150+ per day


Total per week (conservative):

$400‚Äì$500 average from both jobs

Some weeks more, depending on tips


Fixed expenses:

Rent: $550

Food: $250 (cutting down aggressively)

Gas: $20 (I drive a 2001 Toyota Corolla)

Phone: $45

Gym: $17

Laundry: $40

Wilding: $50
‚Üí Total monthly: ~$972


Upcoming cash:

Tax return: ~$1,000 (I haven‚Äôt filed yet, I know I‚Äôm late)

Parents might help me with $200/month

I have a $600 check pending from a previous job but, the owner is an asshole and he doesn't want to rewrite the check because I lost it (its been 3 weeks)


My plan:

I want to work 60+ hours/week. I‚Äôm athletic and healthy, have no medical issues, and plan to sleep 6‚Äì8 hours daily. I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice partying, comfort, and weekends for the rest of the year. I already found a nighttime job in the same district I work (waiting tables) that I might take to bring in another $240‚Äì$300/week. I can go there the nights I'm not bartending, it's going to be brutal but, I want to get out this as soon as possible. 


My main goals:

1. Get out of delinquency ASAP


2. Fix my credit score


3. Pay off all debt in 2025


4. Survive and stay disciplined

If anyone can help me fine-tune my payoff strategy, offer advice on rebuilding credit fast, or recommend smarter moves, I‚Äôm all ears.

This is my first relationship and her fourth (she's a bit older). A few months ago we had quite a big crisis - I lost my job and had only money to survive, so we didn't go out anywhere, and I spent more time at home. The tension between us was constantly growing (our conversations didn‚Äôt help and a lot of nasty words were said), at the same time she started to have better contact with a co-worker, I know she told him about our situation, they often went out in the evenings, I didn't care at all, until now she had only been with girls, so I decided that he was just a friend, and in this difficult situation she needed to get away (my mistake). I was so surprised when I listened to a voice message from her friend, in which she was cheering them on. That‚Äôs when something broke inside me, and I moved out (though we still kept in touch). A few days later, she admitted to me that she had kissed him (he drove her home after a party, went inside with her, and stayed the night).
Long story short: we broke up at that point, but eventually got back together. Unfortunately, their story doesn‚Äôt end there, because he‚Äôs still part of her friend group (they hang out together with the girl who sent the voice message and her boyfriend).

Joe Flint ‚Äî April 23, 2025 at 9:00 am

A group of Warner Bros. Discovery WBD 8.24% executives gathered in a conference room at the Beverly Hills Hotel last spring to discuss a hard truth: Their Max streaming service was kind of a letdown.

Over snacks, coffee and Diet Cokes, they plotted Max‚Äôs revival. 

‚ÄúWe said, ‚ÄòOK, we‚Äôve got to sort of refocus our bull‚Äôs-eye,‚Äô‚Äù said JB Perrette, CEO and president of global streaming.

Warner has spent the past year picking apart and rebuilding Max, turning it into one of the company‚Äôs relative bright spots. The entertainment giant, born out of a 2022 merger between AT&T‚Äôs Warner Media and Discovery Communications, has struggled to convince investors it is on the right track.

JB Perrette, CEO and president of global streaming at Warner, has said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre not fighting for the more-is-better game.‚Äô Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images
The company‚Äôs stock is down about two-thirds since the deal.

Its movie studio suffered a string of flops before ‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie‚Äù and ‚ÄúSinners‚Äù hit it big, and its cable networks are in structural decline. Building momentum at Max is a crucial part of the company‚Äôs pitch to investors.

Max added 20 million subscribers in 2024 to finish the year at 117 million globally, and expects to hit 150 million in 2026. (Netflix, by comparison, ended last year with more than 300 million subscribers.) 

The platform still has a relatively small share of U.S. TV time‚Äîabout 1.5%, according to figures from Nielsen. That is less than Peacock and Paramount+, though Warner executives say Nielsen‚Äôs data doesn‚Äôt capture viewing via Amazon Channels.

Max increased its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to $677 million last year from $103 million a year earlier. It forecast Ebitda of $1.3 billion for the current year.

DATE WITH DESTINY 

When Zaslav unveiled plans for the Max streaming service two years ago, he declared, ‚Äúthis is our rendezvous with destiny.‚Äù

That destiny, as he laid it out at the time, was to be ‚Äúthe place every member of the household can go to.‚Äù It offered critically acclaimed fare from HBO, popular reality shows from Discovery‚Äôs cable networks and lots of children‚Äôs programming.

But most consumers already had a streaming service for every member of the household. It was called Netflix.

From late 2022 until the end of 2023, Max‚Äôs subscriber numbers hovered between 95 million and 100 million.

‚ÄúWhat people want from us in a world where they‚Äôve got Netflix and Amazon are those things that differentiate us,‚Äù Bloys said.

After the Beverly Hills meeting, Max dropped its focus on children‚Äôs programming, acknowledging it couldn‚Äôt break through with young viewers already glued to Netflix and Disney+. Even sacred cows such as ‚ÄúSesame Street‚Äù and the Looney Tunes content library were cut loose.

A lot of Discovery‚Äôs unscripted shows, from channels such as Food Network and HGTV, also weren‚Äôt moving the needle for Max. There is less of that on the platform now.

And while live sports were initially available on the lower priced ad-supported version of Max, now only those with the premium-subscription tier can get baseball, basketball and other sports.

Max‚Äôs second life is more streamlined, with adult-oriented content like ‚ÄúThe Pitt‚Äù and ‚ÄúHacks,‚Äù and true-crime offerings such as the documentary ‚ÄúQuiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV.‚Äù And HBO‚Äôs highly anticipated ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù series is scheduled to debut in 2026.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not fighting for the more-is-better game,‚Äù Perrette said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll let others deal with the volume.‚Äù

BUNDLING UP

One key part of Max‚Äôs makeover was a bundling partnership it launched with Disney last summer in which subscribers can purchase Max, Disney+ and Hulu at a significant discount to their respective stand-alone prices.

It has been a major subscriber driver, with high retention rates, and Warner executives have said they are eager to extend the partnership overseas.

Still, some investors want more wholesale progress from Warner. Late last year, the company restructured into two operating divisions‚Äîone housing the legacy cable business and the other comprising the streaming operation and movie and TV production studios.

The move was seen as a potential precursor to a spinoff or sale of the cable business. Warner added directors with digital and technology chops after encouragement from activist Sessa Capital.

Should a split or spinoff happen, Max would be expected to serve as the ‚Äúrevenue-generating war horse for the company,‚Äù said Guggenheim Securities analyst Michael Morris.

**A long post - but I hope sharing my experience in detail will help others who are going through this too :)**

**Age 30 Female, healthy otherwise, I weigh 120 pounds, and am fairly active.**

* **June:**¬†Diagnosed with LSIL after a Pap test; advised to retest in 6 months.
* **December:**¬†Results showed HSIL; referred for a colposcopy.
* **February:**¬†Colposcopy performed. The procedure was uncomfortable, with significant cramping starting the same day and lasting several days. Around day 4‚Äì5, I passed a large clump, likely Monsel‚Äôs paste, which was alarming. I was told to expect ‚Äúcoffee grounds‚Äù discharge but wasn‚Äôt prepared for a piece of paste and tissue the size of my thumb. I jokingly referred to it as a ‚Äúlarva‚Äù because that‚Äôs what it looked like.
* Results showed CIN2 in the endocervical canal, but no abnormalities on the cervix. A LEEP was recommended.
* **April 1st:**¬†Underwent the LEEP procedure.

While I‚Äôve had awake surgeries before (carpal tunnel release, wisdom teeth removal), nothing prepared me for the sensation of this internal procedure. The numbing injections were painful, and the adrenaline caused a metallic taste and lightheadedness. Fortunately, the actual procedure was quick, about two minutes.

Initially, I felt fine, likely due to lingering numbness. However, the next few days were brutal. I experienced extreme cramping, much worse than any period pain I‚Äôve had. Over the counter meds (200mg ibuprofen and 500mg Tylenol) were nowhere near enough. I recommend taking at least 400‚Äì800mg of ibuprofen beforehand, and throughout healing, as it‚Äôs more effective for this kind of pain. I didn‚Äôt realize I needed a much higher dose and in hindsight, I would be much more aggressive with pain management.

The two weeks following my LEEP were some of the most difficult I‚Äôve ever experienced. I had intense cramping, severe bloating, and persistent lower back pain that kept me awake night after night. Emotionally, I was completely drained, I cried daily and felt like I was barely keeping it together. I was not expecting to experience these feelings, as up until this point I felt okay.

Ten days in, overwhelmed and desperate for relief, I called the clinic. The nurse encouraged me to come in for an assessment. The doctor explained that sometimes blood can be pooling in the cervical area as it heals, which can cause bloating, pressure, and pain. He recommended an ultrasound to rule out complications. Around the same time, I also saw my GP, who suggested a back X-ray due to a recent injury. The scan showed existing spinal issues, and I strongly believe the bloating and swelling in my pelvis from the procedure put additional strain on my back, compounding the pain.

Something I wish I had understood beforehand is that¬†**LEEP is surgery**‚Äîan invasive one. I didn‚Äôt fully grasp the toll it would take on my body. It was downplayed, both by the clinic and in my own mind. I thought two days off work would be enough. It wasn‚Äôt. I ended up going back for a day, only to call in sick the next. I‚Äôd return, then crash again. That start-stop cycle was incredibly frustrating and only made things harder.

If you're preparing for this procedure, please be gentle with yourself. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust a Pap follow-up‚Äù it‚Äôs a real surgical procedure, and your body needs time to recover. Your emotions may feel overwhelming, but they're normal. I wish someone had told me that sooner. Give yourself grace, and don‚Äôt hesitate to advocate for the time and support you need.

Two weeks post-LEEP, I began bleeding heavily at work, passing large, golf-ball-sized clots. It was frightening, but since I wasn‚Äôt soaking a maxi-pad in an hour, I monitored it at home. The bleeding subsided within two days, and I finally felt relief.

Around the same time, I got my pathology results:

* CIN3 was found on the cervix, but the endocervical canal was clear.
* I was initially confused, as this was the reverse of my earlier results.

The clinic explained that during the LEEP, they removed a¬†**cone-shaped section of tissue**¬†from my cervix. This cone shape allows the surgeon to remove not just surface cells on the cervix, but also deeper tissue from the¬†**endocervical canal**, where abnormal cells also develop or hide. By removing tissue in this way, they can ensure that both the visible and potentially hidden areas are addressed in one procedure.

The excised tissue was then¬†**carefully dissected into eight separate sections**¬†to examine every part thoroughly under the microscope. The pathologist checked each slice to look for signs of dysplasia. My results came back showing¬†**CIN3 on the cervix**, but¬†**no abnormalities in the endocervical canal**, and most importantly‚Äî**the margins were clear**. That means no abnormal cells were found at the edges of the removed tissue, which strongly indicates that they got it all.

The nurse told me this was very positive news and explained that because of the way the tissue was removed and analyzed, the team feels confident in the completeness of the treatment. It gave me a huge sense of relief to know the procedure has hopefully its job and that I could focus on healing and rebuilding my body from there.

Since then, I‚Äôve taken proactive steps:

* Started the HPV vaccine series.
* Began taking¬†**Papillex**¬†and¬†**AHCC**¬†supplements.
* Focused on nutrient-dense foods‚Äîespecially vegetables, avocado, and blueberries.
* Prioritized sunlight and exercise to support my immune system.

Now, three weeks post-LEEP, I‚Äôm finally starting to feel like myself again. The intense cramping and back pain have subsided, and I‚Äôve started my period without any unusual bleeding, which brought a huge sense of relief. The first two weeks were incredibly tough, I felt hopeless, which is rare for me. I‚Äôm typically a very optimistic person, but the physical pain combined with the emotional toll was taxing on me.

In trying to make sense of it all, I came across some studies about the body‚Äôs stress response after surgery, and it really resonated. LEEP may be a short procedure, but it‚Äôs still surgery. It disrupts not just tissue, but also hormones, inflammation pathways, and our overall sense of safety and control. Knowing that helped me be more compassionate with myself. Our bodies go through so much more than we realize in the healing process, and it‚Äôs okay to not feel okay for a while. I hope this post helps, as I scoured reddit for two weeks everyday looking for anyone who had experienced what I was going through.¬†

Not just love in general, although that is true too, but romantic love. Not so much a gradual coming to but a realization that smacked me over the head with a two by four shaped like a boy. He was kind, and good, and sweet, and something I had no business trying on. But I did anyway, because it is true what they say. Love is a drug, and it was the first time anyone ever offered me a hit. 

I grew up between two vastly different worlds and different peoples, with raging animosity between the two. White collar, multi generational wealth, liberal, atheist, highly to overly educated people who looked down their nose at you, and who‚Äôs solution for a burnt out lamp was to call the electrician or buy a new lamp. The other were blue collar, multi generational salt of the earth ranchers. Conservative, Christian, who could take your engine apart and put it back together before they got their learners permit. It was an hour commute each way for me, school and work, then back home. Tolerated by both, accepted be neither. Mostly because I was born into it before prejudice sinks its teeth into kids, although it did bare them when puberty hit and kids started becoming interested in the opposite sec. But not me. I would arrive at 8 in the morning for school, and be back on the bus to go home at 5pm. I couldn‚Äôt do after school sports, or clubs, or sleep overs, or parties. I was the conditional friend when it was convenient, and would disappear when it wasn‚Äôt. I tried and failed to go to college twice, before picking a different path, buying a farm sight unseen, moving across the country to chase a blue eyed dream, in a place where the average age is 55. I was two weeks off the moving truck when a long time local on disability told me young folks leave as soon as they can because there is no future here. And he was right. 

Five years later, this boy comes walking into my coffee shop in his DPW town hat and blue collar yellow. He took the time to figure out my very fluid schedule, as I paid the price for my dreams with three jobs in five different states, and would visit me often. It took four months for him to ask for my number, and I gave it to him. It was the first time anyone had ever asked, and the first moment I realized someone could be interested in me. He was the first soul, ever. It took another almost four months for our schedules to align. I was busy living three lives, he was busy, he has a son and near full custody. The result of a teenage pregnancy. I had no business going anywhere near it, but love is a drug, and one of my greatest fears turned out to be true. Love can make you stupid. I should have never opened that door, never gone down that path, never spent those almost four months masquerading at the start of a long distance relationship, even though it was only 19 geographical miles. And the subsequent two months I don‚Äôt dare whisper to a soul. We were never meant to be. I always knew I would leave this place, just not when, and certainly not as soon. And he very plainly told me he wouldn‚Äôt until his son was grown. Stability for him was the most important thing in the world. But we tried, and in the end I had to break both our hearts. The inevitable fate I always knew we‚Äôd run into. But he taught me a lot, and I will forever be grateful for his gifts. 

Love is fake. Love is foolish. Love is dirty and cheap and for fools and other people, but certainly not me. Love makes you weak. Love makes you soft, and nothing of value ever comes from being soft. I remember when he told me I was beautiful, and the only reaction I had was a blank stare because I didn‚Äôt know how to react. Not a single person had ever told me that before. Not a single person had ever tried to win my attention or affection in any way I had noticed. I had long built walls against the idea of love, and he showed me there were cracks in them. That I do want to be loved. That loving and being loved does not make you weak. That despite all my years on this planet building armor against wanting someone, I do deeply want someone. 

Love is real, love is not fake or dirty or cheap, and love can be for me. I want love to be for me. And it smacked me over the head in the shape of a joy at the age of twenty six. It is ok to be soft, it is ok to be held, and have wants and needs. Human connection and reliance is apart of being alive. It is not a sign of weakness, it does not devalue you as a person. On a related note, value of a person is not related to how capable they are, how well they bear weight alone, how independent and self reliant they are. I learned to bear it all alone because there was never anyone who offered to help. There was never any one who offered a hand, or even showed interest. Who‚Äôs thought about kissing me, or dating me, or any of the steps that come after.  But I want someone who does  

I am someone who wants love. And that‚Äôs ok. 

I said goodbye to the town boy. And grieved over it like we ever had a chance, ever were something. We were never meant to be, we were foolish to try, borrowed time even at best, an illusion at worst. He has a girlfriend now. Someone much better suited to him. I‚Äôm in the process of leaving, here again, gone again. I have to find my place first, then I can find my person. And oh how I am impatient for both. It took twenty six years to taste it, the very first time for anything, as little as it was, as insignificant as it may seem to anyone else. As someone who‚Äôs never had or experienced anything, it felt like a whole lot of something. I have tasted a drop of love, and now I cannot get it out of my mind. I‚Äôm hungry for it, I wonder if I‚Äôm addicted. But I think maybe that is what it means to be human",1,1745421723.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

About me:

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life‚Äôs intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There‚Äôs magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you‚Äôre into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

I‚Äôm also in the middle of a fitness journey, building strength and feeling good. Thinking about my first tattoo. you got any awesome designs or stories to share?

What I‚Äôm looking for:

Someone emotionally grounded, kind, curious. Someone who doesn‚Äôt mind sitting in silence sometimes, or sharing weird thoughts and real feelings. If you‚Äôre someone who feels deeply and values presence, we might just get along.

# The Slow Burn of Fatigue and Hopelessness

A few months ago, I hit rock bottom. I wasn‚Äôt sick, but I wasn‚Äôt healthy either. I dragged myself through each day like I was walking through quicksand. My energy was completely depleted. I felt like a phone stuck at 10% battery‚Äîalways about to shut down, never fully charged.

Doctors told me I was ""fine."" Blood work? Normal. Thyroid? Fine. Vitamin levels? ‚ÄúSlightly off but nothing alarming.‚Äù But I knew something was wrong. I wasn‚Äôt living‚ÄîI was surviving.

My brain felt foggy. My body ached for no reason. I had zero motivation. Even simple tasks like doing the dishes or responding to a text felt overwhelming. It was terrifying to feel so *disconnected* from the vibrant, energetic person I used to be.

Then I found **MITOLYN**‚Äîand everything changed.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not just another supplement that promises the world and delivers nothing. It‚Äôs a cutting-edge formula specifically designed to **recharge your mitochondria**‚Äîthe tiny powerhouses inside your cells responsible for energy production.

Most people don‚Äôt realize that as we age, our mitochondria weaken. Poor mitochondrial health equals less energy, slower metabolism, mental fog, and even accelerated aging. But MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt just *support* your mitochondria‚Äîit revitalizes them at the core.

When I first learned this, it all started to make sense. My fatigue wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúaging‚Äù or ‚Äústress.‚Äù It was a **mitochondrial energy crisis.** And MITOLYN turned out to be the lifeline I was desperately looking for.

# Why I Took the Leap

I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI was skeptical at first. I‚Äôve wasted hundreds of dollars on so-called ""energy boosters"" in the past. They always left me jittery, anxious, or just flat-out disappointed.

But the reviews for MITOLYN were different. People talked about *sustainable energy*, *clarity*, *better sleep*, and even *youthful vitality*. No crashes, no side effects. Just real, consistent results.

Plus, the science checked out. Ingredients like PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone), CoQ10, and NAD+ precursors are backed by actual studies. MITOLYN isn‚Äôt fluff‚Äîit‚Äôs **biohacking at its finest.**

So I ordered a one-month supply. Little did I know, that decision would change the trajectory of my life.

# Week 1: Subtle But Promising

By the third day, I noticed something. I wasn‚Äôt dragging myself out of bed. I was *getting up*‚Äîwith ease. No snooze button, no dread. I felt... lighter.

My usual afternoon crash didn‚Äôt hit as hard. I wasn‚Äôt bouncing off the walls, but I felt more balanced. I didn‚Äôt need my second cup of coffee.

Something was definitely shifting.

# Week 2: Clarity, Focus, Drive

This is where the magic really began. I started waking up with a *clear mind*. Tasks that used to feel overwhelming were now easy to knock out. I felt **present** again‚Äîfocused, motivated, and mentally sharp.

For the first time in years, I was working on passion projects in the evening instead of collapsing on the couch.

Friends started commenting on how upbeat I seemed. My partner said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre smiling more. I missed this version of you.‚Äù

I was feeling like *me* again.

# Week 3: Energy Like I Had in My 20s

By week three, I felt unstoppable. I was going on walks, exercising, even cooking full meals from scratch (something I hadn‚Äôt done in ages).

The energy wasn‚Äôt fake or forced‚Äîit was **real**. It came from deep inside, like my cells had remembered how to breathe again.

I didn‚Äôt just feel good. I felt **powerful**.

# Week 4: Deep Sleep and Radiant Health

One of the most unexpected benefits? **Sleep.** I used to toss and turn every night. Now, I fall asleep within minutes and wake up feeling truly rested.

My skin looks brighter. My digestion improved. Even my mood is more stable.

It‚Äôs as if my entire body is working better‚Äî**because it is.** Mitochondria power everything, and MITOLYN brought mine back online.

# The Ingredients That Make It Work

MITOLYN is packed with science-backed ingredients that *target the root cause* of energy loss:

* **PQQ:** Stimulates mitochondrial growth and function.
* **CoQ10:** Essential for cellular energy production.
* **NAD+ Precursors:** Fuel your body‚Äôs anti-aging and repair processes.
* **L-Carnitine & ALCAR:** Enhance brain function and fat metabolism.
* **B-Vitamins & Magnesium:** For nerve health, energy metabolism, and stress resilience.

There‚Äôs nothing artificial. No stimulants. No BS. Just pure, high-quality ingredients that your cells recognize and crave.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

* Struggling with low energy, burnout, or fatigue?
* Dealing with brain fog or forgetfulness?
* Waking up tired no matter how long you sleep?
* Feeling older than you are?

Then trust me‚Äî**you owe it to yourself to try MITOLYN.** You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

# Final Verdict: Don‚Äôt Wait Like I Did

I wish I had found MITOLYN years ago. I lost so much time living at half-capacity, thinking I just had to ‚Äúaccept‚Äù the decline.

You don‚Äôt.

You don‚Äôt have to feel tired all the time. You don‚Äôt have to push through the fog. You don‚Äôt have to miss out on life.

MITOLYN gave me back my vitality, my passion, and my zest for living. If you're on the fence, take this as your sign. Don‚Äôt wait for your body to hit rock bottom.

I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI was skeptical at first. I‚Äôve wasted hundreds of dollars on so-called ""energy boosters"" in the past. They always left me jittery, anxious, or just flat-out disappointed.

But the reviews for MITOLYN were different. People talked about *sustainable energy*, *clarity*, *better sleep*, and even *youthful vitality*. No crashes, no side effects. Just real, consistent results.

Plus, the science checked out. Ingredients like PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone), CoQ10, and NAD+ precursors are backed by actual studies. MITOLYN isn‚Äôt fluff‚Äîit‚Äôs **biohacking at its finest.**

So I ordered a one-month supply. Little did I know, that decision would change the trajectory of my life.

# Week 1: Subtle But Promising

By the third day, I noticed something. I wasn‚Äôt dragging myself out of bed. I was *getting up*‚Äîwith ease. No snooze button, no dread. I felt... lighter.

My usual afternoon crash didn‚Äôt hit as hard. I wasn‚Äôt bouncing off the walls, but I felt more balanced. I didn‚Äôt need my second cup of coffee.

Something was definitely shifting.

# Week 2: Clarity, Focus, Drive

This is where the magic really began. I started waking up with a *clear mind*. Tasks that used to feel overwhelming were now easy to knock out. I felt **present** again‚Äîfocused, motivated, and mentally sharp.

For the first time in years, I was working on passion projects in the evening instead of collapsing on the couch.

Friends started commenting on how upbeat I seemed. My partner said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre smiling more. I missed this version of you.‚Äù

I was feeling like *me* again.

# Week 3: Energy Like I Had in My 20s

By week three, I felt unstoppable. I was going on walks, exercising, even cooking full meals from scratch (something I hadn‚Äôt done in ages).

The energy wasn‚Äôt fake or forced‚Äîit was **real**. It came from deep inside, like my cells had remembered how to breathe again.

I didn‚Äôt just feel good. I felt **powerful**.

# Week 4: Deep Sleep and Radiant Health

One of the most unexpected benefits? **Sleep.** I used to toss and turn every night. Now, I fall asleep within minutes and wake up feeling truly rested.

My skin looks brighter. My digestion improved. Even my mood is more stable.

It‚Äôs as if my entire body is working better‚Äî**because it is.** Mitochondria power everything, and MITOLYN brought mine back online.

# The Ingredients That Make It Work

MITOLYN is packed with science-backed ingredients that *target the root cause* of energy loss:

* **PQQ:** Stimulates mitochondrial growth and function.
* **CoQ10:** Essential for cellular energy production.
* **NAD+ Precursors:** Fuel your body‚Äôs anti-aging and repair processes.
* **L-Carnitine & ALCAR:** Enhance brain function and fat metabolism.
* **B-Vitamins & Magnesium:** For nerve health, energy metabolism, and stress resilience.

There‚Äôs nothing artificial. No stimulants. No BS. Just pure, high-quality ingredients that your cells recognize and crave.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

* Struggling with low energy, burnout, or fatigue?
* Dealing with brain fog or forgetfulness?
* Waking up tired no matter how long you sleep?
* Feeling older than you are?

Then trust me‚Äî**you owe it to yourself to try MITOLYN.** You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

# Final Verdict: Don‚Äôt Wait Like I Did

I wish I had found MITOLYN years ago. I lost so much time living at half-capacity, thinking I just had to ‚Äúaccept‚Äù the decline.

You don‚Äôt.

You don‚Äôt have to feel tired all the time. You don‚Äôt have to push through the fog. You don‚Äôt have to miss out on life.

MITOLYN gave me back my vitality, my passion, and my zest for living. If you're on the fence, take this as your sign. Don‚Äôt wait for your body to hit rock bottom.

# The Slow Burn of Fatigue and Hopelessness

A few months ago, I hit rock bottom. I wasn‚Äôt sick, but I wasn‚Äôt healthy either. I dragged myself through each day like I was walking through quicksand. My energy was completely depleted. I felt like a phone stuck at 10% battery‚Äîalways about to shut down, never fully charged.

Doctors told me I was ""fine."" Blood work? Normal. Thyroid? Fine. Vitamin levels? ‚ÄúSlightly off but nothing alarming.‚Äù But I knew something was wrong. I wasn‚Äôt living‚ÄîI was surviving.

My brain felt foggy. My body ached for no reason. I had zero motivation. Even simple tasks like doing the dishes or responding to a text felt overwhelming. It was terrifying to feel so *disconnected* from the vibrant, energetic person I used to be.

Then I found **MITOLYN**‚Äîand everything changed.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not just another supplement that promises the world and delivers nothing. It‚Äôs a cutting-edge formula specifically designed to **recharge your mitochondria**‚Äîthe tiny powerhouses inside your cells responsible for energy production.

Most people don‚Äôt realize that as we age, our mitochondria weaken. Poor mitochondrial health equals less energy, slower metabolism, mental fog, and even accelerated aging. But MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt just *support* your mitochondria‚Äîit revitalizes them at the core.

The idea sparked during a chat about the hassle of listing past travels for visa applications, specifically remembering all those passport stamps and dates. Inspired, I whipped up a quick prototype in just a few hours, and was amazed by the initial feedback ‚Äì someone instantly created their travel list in 5 minutes!

That led to the **Visual Travel History Generator** ([https://travel.pavelcherkashin.com](https://travel.pavelcherkashin.com)). It's a modern web app designed to finally give those passport stamps a dynamic life beyond just ink on paper. Simply upload photos of your passport pages, and AI gets to work, extracting the countries and dates for you.

I even experimented with both OpenAI (gpt-4o) and Google Gemini (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) models and found Gemini surprisingly more accurate for stamp recognition ‚Äì so that's my go-to recommendation!

Your travel history then comes alive on an interactive, animated world map and a timeline. You can easily edit any details the AI might miss and export the results in various formats like PDF, JSON, or XLSX.

The best part? It's free, no registration or SMS needed. Your privacy is paramount ‚Äì your images are processed securely, and never stored within the app. All you need is your own API key from OpenAI or Google Gemini, which is used solely for the recognition process during your session.

I truly hope this tool simplifies things for you and helps you visualize your incredible journeys. If it does, and you feel like supporting the caffeine-fueled development, you can find a 'Buy me a Coffee' button on the results page.

# My Gut Was a Mess ‚Äì And So Was My Life

For years, I struggled with gut issues. I‚Äôm talking about constant bloating, random stomach cramps, gas, embarrassing bathroom issues, and a stubborn weight that refused to go away no matter how ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù I tried to eat.

Every morning, I would wake up with a heavy stomach. By 2 PM, I needed a nap. My skin was dull, my energy was at rock bottom, and my mental clarity? Non-existent.

I tried probiotics from the drugstore. I tried fiber powders. I even tried eliminating foods like dairy, gluten, and sugar. But nothing worked ‚Äì at least not consistently. And worst of all, I started to believe that this was just ‚Äúhow my body is now.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I discovered **PrimeBiome**.

# What Is PrimeBiome?

PrimeBiome is a **premium gut-health formula** that goes beyond just being a probiotic. It‚Äôs loaded with **high-quality, clinically proven strains of probiotics, prebiotics, digestive enzymes**, and more.

But what makes it truly stand out is this:

>

And the best part? It does all this *naturally*.

# Week-by-Week Experience Using PrimeBiome

Let me break it down so you know exactly what to expect:

# ‚úÖ Week 1 ‚Äì Immediate Relief

Within just 3 days, I noticed that my bloating had drastically reduced. I could eat my favorite foods again without doubling over in discomfort. I wasn‚Äôt running to the bathroom, and for the first time in years, I felt‚Ä¶ *normal*.

It‚Äôs hard to explain how powerful that is unless you‚Äôve lived with daily gut issues. It felt like my body was finally cooperating with me.

# ‚úÖ Week 2 ‚Äì More Energy, Better Sleep

By the second week, my energy was on another level. I didn‚Äôt need coffee to keep my eyes open. I was getting through work with full focus and actually sleeping deeply at night.

Oh, and something I didn‚Äôt expect? **My skin started clearing up.** I wasn‚Äôt even using any new skincare products ‚Äì it was all internal healing from PrimeBiome.

# ‚úÖ Week 3 ‚Äì Slimmer Waistline, Less Cravings

This week was when I really started to *feel* and *see* the weight loss benefits. I wasn‚Äôt bloated, my pants were looser, and I noticed I had way fewer cravings for sugar and carbs.

I later found out this was due to the **balanced gut bacteria PrimeBiome supports**, which helps regulate appetite and hunger hormones.

# ‚úÖ Week 4 ‚Äì Total Body Transformation

By the end of the month, I felt like a brand new person. I had dropped 6 pounds without changing my diet. My digestion was flawless. I wasn‚Äôt bloated at all. My mind was sharper. I was even in a better mood.

And get this ‚Äì people started noticing. Friends asked me if I had started working out (I hadn‚Äôt!). One coworker said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre glowing lately, what are you doing differently?‚Äù

The answer: **PrimeBiome**.

# What‚Äôs Inside PrimeBiome That Makes It So Effective?

Let‚Äôs quickly look at what makes this formula so powerful:

* **11 Proven Strains of Probiotics** (including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) ‚Äì for restoring good gut bacteria
* **Prebiotic Fiber** ‚Äì to feed and support those healthy bacteria
* **Digestive Enzymes** ‚Äì for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients better
* **Zinc, Magnesium & Turmeric** ‚Äì to reduce gut inflammation and improve immunity

It‚Äôs non-GMO, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free, and manufactured in a GMP-certified facility in the USA. That‚Äôs quality you can trust.

# Why PrimeBiome Is Better Than Any Other Probiotic I‚Äôve Tried

I‚Äôve tried 7 different gut health supplements before. Most of them gave me either:

* Zero results
* Temporary relief
* Or worse ‚Äì more bloating

PrimeBiome was different from the start. Why?

1. **It doesn‚Äôt just give you probiotics ‚Äì it gives you the** ***whole system*** (enzymes + prebiotics + gut-healing minerals)
2. **It‚Äôs shelf-stable** ‚Äì no refrigeration needed
3. **It‚Äôs backed by real clinical science**
4. **It actually WORKS** ‚Äì and works fast

# Who Should Try PrimeBiome?

Honestly? If you‚Äôve experienced *any* of the following, PrimeBiome is worth trying ASAP:

* Bloating or gas after meals
* Food intolerances or random stomach pain
* Low energy or constant fatigue
* Mood swings or brain fog
* Difficulty losing weight or stubborn belly fat
* Skin problems like acne or dullness
* Poor sleep or low immunity

Because these are all linked to **an unbalanced gut** ‚Äì and PrimeBiome helps restore it naturally.

# Final Verdict: This Is More Than a Supplement ‚Äì It‚Äôs a Life Upgrade

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling off, bloated, or just not like yourself ‚Äì **PrimeBiome might just be the one thing that transforms your health from the inside out**.

It did for me. I wake up energized. I digest better. I feel lighter. My mind is clearer. And I honestly feel 10 years younger.

I wish I had started using this sooner.

# My Gut Was a Mess ‚Äì And So Was My Life

For years, I struggled with gut issues. I‚Äôm talking about constant bloating, random stomach cramps, gas, embarrassing bathroom issues, and a stubborn weight that refused to go away no matter how ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù I tried to eat.

Every morning, I would wake up with a heavy stomach. By 2 PM, I needed a nap. My skin was dull, my energy was at rock bottom, and my mental clarity? Non-existent.

I tried probiotics from the drugstore. I tried fiber powders. I even tried eliminating foods like dairy, gluten, and sugar. But nothing worked ‚Äì at least not consistently. And worst of all, I started to believe that this was just ‚Äúhow my body is now.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I discovered **PrimeBiome**.

# What Is PrimeBiome?

PrimeBiome is a **premium gut-health formula** that goes beyond just being a probiotic. It‚Äôs loaded with **high-quality, clinically proven strains of probiotics, prebiotics, digestive enzymes**, and more.

But what makes it truly stand out is this:

>

And the best part? It does all this *naturally*.

# Week-by-Week Experience Using PrimeBiome

Let me break it down so you know exactly what to expect:

# ‚úÖ Week 1 ‚Äì Immediate Relief

Within just 3 days, I noticed that my bloating had drastically reduced. I could eat my favorite foods again without doubling over in discomfort. I wasn‚Äôt running to the bathroom, and for the first time in years, I felt‚Ä¶ *normal*.

It‚Äôs hard to explain how powerful that is unless you‚Äôve lived with daily gut issues. It felt like my body was finally cooperating with me.

# ‚úÖ Week 2 ‚Äì More Energy, Better Sleep

By the second week, my energy was on another level. I didn‚Äôt need coffee to keep my eyes open. I was getting through work with full focus and actually sleeping deeply at night.

Oh, and something I didn‚Äôt expect? **My skin started clearing up.** I wasn‚Äôt even using any new skincare products ‚Äì it was all internal healing from PrimeBiome.

# ‚úÖ Week 3 ‚Äì Slimmer Waistline, Less Cravings

This week was when I really started to *feel* and *see* the weight loss benefits. I wasn‚Äôt bloated, my pants were looser, and I noticed I had way fewer cravings for sugar and carbs.

I later found out this was due to the **balanced gut bacteria PrimeBiome supports**, which helps regulate appetite and hunger hormones.

# ‚úÖ Week 4 ‚Äì Total Body Transformation

By the end of the month, I felt like a brand new person. I had dropped 6 pounds without changing my diet. My digestion was flawless. I wasn‚Äôt bloated at all. My mind was sharper. I was even in a better mood.

And get this ‚Äì people started noticing. Friends asked me if I had started working out (I hadn‚Äôt!). One coworker said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre glowing lately, what are you doing differently?‚Äù

The answer: **PrimeBiome**.

# What‚Äôs Inside PrimeBiome That Makes It So Effective?

Let‚Äôs quickly look at what makes this formula so powerful:

* **11 Proven Strains of Probiotics** (including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) ‚Äì for restoring good gut bacteria
* **Prebiotic Fiber** ‚Äì to feed and support those healthy bacteria
* **Digestive Enzymes** ‚Äì for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients better
* **Zinc, Magnesium & Turmeric** ‚Äì to reduce gut inflammation and improve immunity

It‚Äôs non-GMO, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free, and manufactured in a GMP-certified facility in the USA. That‚Äôs quality you can trust.

# Why PrimeBiome Is Better Than Any Other Probiotic I‚Äôve Tried

I‚Äôve tried 7 different gut health supplements before. Most of them gave me either:

* Zero results
* Temporary relief
* Or worse ‚Äì more bloating

PrimeBiome was different from the start. Why?

1. **It doesn‚Äôt just give you probiotics ‚Äì it gives you the** ***whole system*** (enzymes + prebiotics + gut-healing minerals)
2. **It‚Äôs shelf-stable** ‚Äì no refrigeration needed
3. **It‚Äôs backed by real clinical science**
4. **It actually WORKS** ‚Äì and works fast

# Who Should Try PrimeBiome?

Honestly? If you‚Äôve experienced *any* of the following, PrimeBiome is worth trying ASAP:

* Bloating or gas after meals
* Food intolerances or random stomach pain
* Low energy or constant fatigue
* Mood swings or brain fog
* Difficulty losing weight or stubborn belly fat
* Skin problems like acne or dullness
* Poor sleep or low immunity

I thought my story would get torn apart. Thought people would call it fake, say I made it all up. But honestly? I *cut parts out* just to make it believable. Like the time I had no money, was sick, and my mom made me drink my own piss ‚Äòcause she‚Äôd heard it boosts immunity. Yeah. That happened. But there are things even I'm not ready to share. Not yet. Also I haven't added much details cause seriously it won't fit here. 

Grammarly helped me a lot in writing 

Anyway, here‚Äôs **Part 2**.

After I passed +2, I stayed in Nepal. And by ‚Äústayed,‚Äù I mean I roamed. The streets were my schedule. I got into smoking, drugs ‚Äî not just your regular stuff. I'm talking stuff even border patrol takes to stay alert ‚Äî keeps you awake for days, won‚Äôt let you blink. I was a walking zombie.

But through all that, I had my best friend. The one I told you about. His family took me in. His two sisters became mine. Even invited me to their *Bhai Tika* celebration ‚Äî first time I‚Äôd felt something close to a family. I nearly cried. That moment? It saved me. I quit drugs. I wanted to do something real.

I had done Barista training back when I thought I was going abroad, so I used that. Landed a paid internship in Teku ‚Äî at one of the Kwality Food joints. But it was a mission. My home was deep inside Gongabu ‚Äî I‚Äôd take 3 buses just to get there. And at night, sometimes 11‚Äì12, I‚Äôd walk home ‚Äòcause the drunk customers wouldn‚Äôt leave.

So I asked my mom for something big: a scooter. She said yes‚Ä¶ under one condition ‚Äî I had to ask my *dad*.  
Now, after all the drama (you know what I mean if you read Part 1), I hadn‚Äôt spoken to him in a year. But for a scooter? I swallowed my pride. My mom called him, and I asked.

He said OK.  
I was over the moon.

A week later, he showed up with a yellow 60K scooty ‚Äî 60 lot. Was it fancy? No. But to me? It was everything. I thanked him, even if we still barely spoke.

But then‚Ä¶ the job didn‚Äôt pay me. A full month of work, and not a rupee. So I quit. And yeah ‚Äî I took a bag of coffee beans with me out of spite. Whatever. I had no regrets.

Things were smooth for a bit. Then one day, me and my best friend were playing PUBG. He invited a girl to the match. Next day, we‚Äôre chilling at our hangout spot ‚Äî smoking, vibing ‚Äî and she‚Äôs there. He says, ‚ÄúHey, this is the girl from last night.‚Äù I go, ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ whatevaa.‚Äù

We smoked together. Played again at night. Time passed‚Ä¶ and we fell in love.

She was older. Had lived with her ex before. But I didn‚Äôt care. I brought her home after 6 months.  
My parents? They weren‚Äôt cool with it.  
But I didn‚Äôt listen.

(Yeah, you know I messed up.)

Two years in, I was exhausted. The drama, her issues, her past‚Ä¶ her ex was linked to one of Nepal‚Äôs biggest ex-gangsters. He started blackmailing me. I was drained.  
So I cheated.  
With a girl who‚Äôd liked me for a year. Someone I lowkey had feelings for too.

And then‚Ä¶ right after I cheated, life threw the final punch.

A neighbor asked me for a ‚Äúfavor.‚Äù Said he knew someone applying for Nepal Police but was too dumb to pass the exam. He offered me 2K to take the *Lok Sewa* test for him. I was depressed. Lost. Rejected by life. All my close school friends ‚Äî we were 7 tight ‚Äî went to Korea together and straight up blocked me when they got there. Even my best friend had left for Australia. I was alone.

So I said, ‚ÄúF\*\*\* it.‚Äù

I went. Took the test. Two cops walked in mid-exam, saying someone got caught impersonating another candidate. I was literally doing the same thing.

I got caught.  
An ASP slapped me *hard* and paraded me like a circus clown.  
Everyone laughed.

I stayed calm ‚Äòcause the guy who hired me swore he‚Äôd bribe the cops and get me out.  
Yeah‚Ä¶ right.

They took me to the station. There was another guy who also got caught. We were both processed in front of everyone. Laughed at. Then they searched us, took our laces and socks ‚Äî later I learned it was so we couldn‚Äôt hang ourselves (someone had done that before).

They beat us up for no reason.  
Then told us to clean the toilet.  
The officer just stared. Didn‚Äôt care.

After that, we were shoved into a dark room ‚Äî no windows. Designed for 15, packed with 45.  
That‚Äôs a Nepal police cell, baby.  
It was summer. No air. You only got to use the toilet twice a day‚Ä¶ right next to where the food was served.  
No door. No dignity.

I had to sit in a crouched position the whole time. Eat like that. Sleep like that.

Eventually, they let me call someone. I called my girlfriend.

She came. First thing she said:  
‚ÄúI know you cheated on me with \*\*\*\*\*\*.‚Äù  
I froze.

I begged her to help first ‚Äî told her to call her dad (an ex-officer). But he couldn‚Äôt help. This wasn‚Äôt a regular case. It was registered by Lok Sewa Ayog. Official.

So I told her to call my parents.  
It was too late ‚Äî the cops said they could come the next day.

That night‚Ä¶ I forgot I was hungry. Just numb. When food finally came, I took it slowly, respectfully. But yeah ‚Äî it was served right outside the open, doorless toilet.

This post‚Äôs already long.  
I thought I could finish it here‚Ä¶  
But there‚Äôs still the part where I was sentenced to 5‚Äì10 years in prison.

I wanted to post my story here because I know when I first received my DOR diagnosis, I scoured this subreddit for success stories for people with similarly low AMH and didn't find too many.  I hope this is helpful to someone in the future.  Apologies in advance for the length, but I want to be as detailed as I can.  ***TW:  success, mentions of loss.***

Today, I ""graduated"" from my fertility clinic at 8w4d measuring 8w3d with a fetal heart rate of 173.  We were lucky and had success with our first medicated IUI cycle after a MMC in 2023, chemical pregnancy in 2024, DOR diagnosis six months ago, and our REs telling us our only chance for success was to use donor eggs.  Initial CD3 bloodwork in August 2024 showed AMH <.08ng/mL, FSH 15.17 mIU/mL, and E2 <15pg/mL.  TSH has always been normal.  We never specifically retested my AMH, but FSH has steadily increased since.  I advocated for IUI to try and get pregnant with my own eggs, since they would not proceed with IVF because of my low AMH.  I'm glad I did!

For the medicated IUI cycle, I took 100mg Clomid and 7.5mg Letrozole for 5 days beginning CD3.  CD3 bloodwork showed FSH 22.1, E2 28.7, and LH 8.32, with an AFC 3.  (I'm located in the U.S., so all values are in standard U.S. measurements.)

Monitoring appointment on CD12 showed one lead follicle >20mm on my left ovary and 1 teenie tiny follicle <10mm on my right ovary.  (However, it appears the third follicle on my left ovary was obscured by the large lead, because I eventually ovulated 2 follicles from my left side.)  E2 221, LH 14.4, endometrial lining was determined too thin to trigger at 5.06 and I returned the following day for another monitoring appointment where the numbers looked much better:  still same for follicles, but E2 292, LH 28.6, and lining 8.24.  I triggered with Ovidrel at 6PM that evening and the IUI was scheduled for the following day.  My spouse provided a fresh sperm sample and the procedure took place just before noon on CD14.

Then, the waiting.  A week after my IUI, I started taking 2mg of Estradiol twice a day and continued for 7 days.  I tested out the trigger shot at around 10dpIUI, had my first faint positive test 12dpIUI, and confirmed BFP with my clinic at 14dpIUI.  Blood work CD30 showed HCG 254, Progesterone 23.3, with two corpus luteum cysts on my left ovary.  Blood work two days later confirmed HCG 776, Progesterone 27.5, and appointment a week later showed gestational sac and yolk sac.  Since then, we have measured almost exactly on time with fetal heartbeat detected via transvaginal ultrasound at 6w4d, and the heart rate of 173 confirmed this morning at 8w4d.

**Things that definitely helped:**  All the medications!  I am grateful that my RE threw everything at this cycle by having me taking Clomid and Letrozole in combination.  In previous monitoring, my follicles were very slow to grow and I think giving them a boost was extremely necessary.  Taking estradiol to support my lining in the luteal phase was super important, I think, because my estrogen has generally been on the lower side.

**Things that probably helped:**  Supplements & testing!  I'd been taking CoQ10, vitamin D, a prenatal, and fish oil for a long time, but I bumped up my vitamin D and added DHEA in late December.  Anectdotally, when I started taking the DHEA, I suddenly had a lot more energy and my libido, which had been MIA for some time, returned in force.  I don't know if the DHEA is the reason why because we didn't test my levels (I took it after my clinic essentially said, ""can't hurt.""), but I truly believe this was a crucial piece of the puzzle for my body.  My spouse also took supplements for male fertility and had an SA which came back normal.  I had a saline sonogram and HSG the cycle prior to IUI, which resulted in a very strange *not-period* that expelled a lot of brown blood and several clots.  I don't know how necessary this was, but it feels like it must have meant something.

**Things that might have helped:**  I didn't drink in January at all, and hardly at all in February or March leading up to the IUI, and started acupuncture in January.  Initially, I went to acupuncture bi-weekly and then weekly just prior to this cycle starting.  I also cut way way back on caffeine starting in January, down to 1 cup of tea/day by March (I had previously been a 3 large coffees a day person).

**Things that made me think all was lost:**  I had a wicked head cold that migrated to my chest the week of the IUI into the first week of the TWW.  I had a fever for a few days as well and was so disappointed and sure that we had ruined our chances.  I also experienced what I called a ""telltale temp drop"" 10DPO that I assumed meant I was out.  However, my temp shot back up the next day and then took off for real on 12DPO.  Just goes to show that there is always hope, even in an ""imperfect"" cycle, and you're not out until your period arrives!

There is still a long way to go and I have a lot of worries and concerns that probably won't ever go away, but I am so grateful for this community (and other place on Reddit) where I found success stories and learned how to ask the right questions and advocate for what I wanted.  I am hopeful that this will be it for us.

i like the thought of eating someone - especially their organs and it's one of my fantasies to have someone who would let me taste their flesh. even more i like to imagine myself being eaten, which is something that's been on my mind for a long time. at first i simply ate my skin or intentionally hurt myself to drink my blood but it quickly stopped being enough, so i decided to do something more

thus, one day i took a razor blade and just cut out a piece of my flesh. there was a lot of blood and i messed up part of this piece, so i had to eat it raw (i think i also ate some of my skin nerves?? or whatever those things were!) but the other part of it was alright, so i fried it, added to my scrambled eggs and then ate, while drinking a coffee with a bit of dish soap

while i am somewhat aware that this is a bit weird, i can't look at this as something completely abnormal or bad - i don't regret it and would love to do it again. and like i said before it doesn't really bother me. yet i wonder sometimes; what if i got drunk or high? would i lose control and eat someone? or what if i started to eat more and more of my flesh, reaching the point where i wouldn't be able to stop?

well, those are just silly thoughts and i'm rather sure that none of them will happen! but i still don't know what should i do or where did those urges came from",0,1745421069.0,AskDocs,2,0.5,False

If you‚Äôve ever stood in the baby food aisle and whispered, *""What foods should I avoid giving my baby?""* ‚Äî first, know you‚Äôre not alone. Second, you‚Äôre asking the right question. Because when it comes to feeding babies, **some foods can be risky ‚Äî and not just the ones that stain clothes.** üëïüí•

**Top Foods to Avoid in the First Year** üö´

Let‚Äôs explore the **no-go goodies** for babies under 12 months:

* **Honey** ‚Äì Sounds harmless, right? But it can carry *Clostridium botulinum* spores, leading to **infant botulism**. Wait until your baby turns 1.
* **Cow‚Äôs Milk** ‚Äì Not suitable before one year. It lacks vital nutrients and can be hard to digest. Stick with breast milk or formula.
* **Sugary Snacks** ‚Äì Candies, cookies, and processed sweets promote **unhealthy habits** and **early tooth decay**.
* **Salty Foods** ‚Äì Baby kidneys aren‚Äôt ready for excess sodium. Say no to chips and salty crackers.
* **Whole Nuts & Peanuts** ‚Äì Major choking hazard. üÜò Use smooth nut butters instead.
* **Soft Cheeses (Unpasteurized)** ‚Äì Brie, camembert, and the like may carry **Listeria**. Choose pasteurized options.
* **Undercooked or Raw Eggs** ‚Äì Risk of Salmonella. Cook thoroughly until yolks are firm.
* **High-Mercury Fish** ‚Äì Avoid shark, swordfish, and king mackerel. **Salmon and cod** are safer, nutritious picks.
* **Caffeinated Drinks** ‚Äì Tea, coffee, and energy drinks are off-limits. üòµ Water, breast milk, or formula are best.
* **Unpasteurized Juices & Dairy** ‚Äì These can harbor harmful bacteria. Always opt for pasteurized.

**Watch Out for Choking Hazards** üò¨ Even nutritious foods can be dangerous if not served safely:

* **Whole grapes & cherry tomatoes** ‚Äì Slice into quarters and consider peeling.
* **Popcorn & hard candies** ‚Äì High choking risk. Avoid entirely.
* **Raw carrots** ‚Äì Steam or finely grate to make them baby-friendly.

**Navigating Allergenic Foods** ‚ö†Ô∏è Allergens aren‚Äôt totally off-limits ‚Äî just handle them with **care**:

* **Peanuts & tree nuts** ‚Äì Use smooth nut butters and introduce them slowly.
* **Eggs** ‚Äì Serve well-cooked and increase portions gradually.
* **Fish & shellfish** ‚Äì Start small, especially if allergies run in the family.

**Pro Tips from a Health Researcher (That‚Äôs Me!)** üë©‚Äçüî¨

* Always introduce one new food at a time.
* Watch for any unusual reactions.
* Have emergency contact info handy ‚Äî just in case.
* Consult your pediatrician, not just a parenting forum. üòÖ

Hey everyone, I wanted to share a small project born out of a real-world problem. The idea sparked during a chat about the hassle of listing past travels for visa applications, specifically remembering all those passport stamps and dates. Inspired, I whipped up a quick prototype in just a few hours, and was amazed by the initial feedback ‚Äì someone instantly created their travel list in 5 minutes!

That led to the **Visual Travel History Generator** (https://travel.pavelcherkashin.com). It's a modern web app designed to finally give those passport stamps a dynamic life beyond just ink on paper. Simply upload photos of your passport pages, and AI gets to work, extracting the countries and dates for you.

I even experimented with both OpenAI (gpt-4o) and Google Gemini (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25) models and found Gemini surprisingly more accurate for stamp recognition ‚Äì so that's my go-to recommendation!

Your travel history then comes alive on an interactive, animated world map and a timeline. You can easily edit any details the AI might miss and export the results in various formats like PDF, JSON, or XLSX.

The best part? It's free, no registration or SMS needed. Your privacy is paramount ‚Äì your images are processed securely, and never stored within the app. All you need is your own API key from OpenAI or Google Gemini, which is used solely for the recognition process during your session.

I truly hope this tool simplifies things for you and helps you visualize your incredible journeys. If it does, and you feel like supporting the caffeine-fueled development, you can find a 'Buy me a Coffee' button on the results page.

I, (30F) started talking to this guy (30M) off bumble, we hit it right off the bat, the conversation flowed naturally and we texted the entire night (til 4am) 
We discussed our intentions, interests, work, hobbies etc. he had started calling me baby and all too. He did seem to be a little conservative but since its acceptable in our community and not a big deal, I went with it.
Now, he would text me good morning every day, and would always let me know before sleeping. He had a strict father so he would sleep around 1 and would wake up around 9am. He told me his father was leaving the town for a week so we waited til that happened and then met up for coffee. The meet up was fun, light, and we kissed as well. 
After his father left he started to sleep without letting me know and would wake up later than before, which wasn‚Äôt a problem but I still addressed it and asked him why wouldn‚Äôt he let me know before sleeping, he said ‚ÄúIs there a handbook which says I can‚Äôt sleep til noon?‚Äù
It rubbed me off the wrong way, but I tried to explain how I didn‚Äôt mean it the wrong way but since he would always tell me before sleeping, and hadn‚Äôt been doing for for the past 2-3 days, I was just wondering why. He proceeded to get mad and said ‚ÄúThis is why I don‚Äôt do relationships and this is who I am, Im not changing for nobody‚Äù we argued a bit but the last nail in the coffin was when he said ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt even pick up my girl‚Äôs call if she ever called me while Im with my cousins or friends‚Äù to which I replied ‚Äúyou can always let her know that you are with your friends or family‚Äù he said he wouldn‚Äôt change and doesn‚Äôt want to. I said take care and blocked him. However, after 2 days I apologised for blocking him and he did not reply. 
It all happened within 2 weeks of talking. Was it too soon to address my expectations? And was I in the wrong for blocking him over what he said?

I made a mistake, I had booked a short trip with 2 of my girlfriends about a month ago. I had briefly mentioned to my Q (partner) that I was thinking about a trip. When I got round to booking it he was in a bad binge. I didnt tell him at the time because he was very unstable. We don't live together and he has children so I do occasionally plan my own thing.

He's been in a binge since November until 2 weeks ago (although he's now back to drinking shandys...). In those 4 months he's:
- been arrested and questioned under caution by police. He won't tell me what happened but said he caused a 'ruckus '

- due to said arrest I had to cancel out holiday that I had booked and paid for. I lost out on ¬£350 which he said he'd pay back but never has.

- he has an inappropriate friendship with a woman in our work place. It's a long story but in short, if it was the other way around he would be furious with me. He told me he'd stopped speaking to this woman because of me. Made me feel very bad about it. A few months later i found out they were meeting up for coffee again. She had actually stopped speaking to him due to her controlling ex at the time. He made up that it was my fault.

- when his drinking was very bad, he kept cancelling on me last minute. It was a nightmare. Also wouldn't accept help.

- I have supported him all the way through this binge and never felt like I could voice any of my upsets because he just blames his MH.

I had forgot about the trip until last week. I hadn't even booked the time off work. I work 4 jobs at the moment to try and get back on my feet. My life is chaos. When I realised I hadn't told him I become very scared and anxious as I knew he'd kick off. He is always paranoid I will go off and cheat.

I told him earlier on the phone, I apologised to him. He has his kids the next 2 days so we wouldn't be seeing each other anyways.

He cut the call short, sent me a short message telling me to enjoy it (I know it was sarcastic) and has blocked me.

I have codependency issues I've been working on a lot. I am reacting the calmest I ever have but I can feel the anxiety building.

I don't know what I'm looking for, maybe some reassurance I'm not completely awful for not telling him about the trip sooner. I dont know what to do. I've text him where I don't think I'm blocked and told him to tell me when he's free for me to call him. The told him we need to talk.

They would complain about taking a girl out, the costs and all that. I used to feel very bad about that and I am in a career where I make a bit of money. So I would help.


I went for coffee dates, had an entire 3 month relationship where we went halfsies, had a guy once take me out on a date to ask for 300 dollars and my last relationship I spent over 6k flying to him and also helping him.

My brother and I compared notes and I told him, I am the guy in all my relationships. However, instead of being rewarded with love, respect or appreciation, I get poor behavior, sexual boundaries crossed and lack of commitment.

Being in this position has given me an opportunity to see men's revealed preferences as opposed to their stated ones. Here is the truth no one wants to admit.

1. Men are just as opportunistic as women. If you have money and they know it, they will both try to go after you to get it or date you in order to accomplish that. I feel sick when I see a guy's eyes light up when I mention my occupation, I know I'm about to be a walking wallet. 

2. Men's ego cannot handle women outpacing them. Every single man I have ever dated except the ones who were on my level with money or education had some issue with my career. Little comments were cutting: Never put your career above me (after date one). Don't ever think you are better than me(another 2 months in) and my last guy whom I loved ( if I never make money will you ever respect me?--- last one, now that I think of it, broke my heart). I feel penalized for working hard and earning more, almost like society hates me for what I have done. It makes me resentful of the world sometimes.

3. Fifty fifty is failure.
Biology isn't fifty/fifty. I'm on a clock, most men are not. I spend money on makeup, skincare and hair to try my hardest to be somewhat palatable, men are not doing this. I buy lingerie, men just have to show up. If I'm also now paying for flights, dates and at one point a guy wanted me to pay for an exam; then I'm losing out.

The relationship is progressing slowly, we are only able to meet every other weekend when our kids are with their other parents. As such we have only seen each other in person on 5 dates over the past 3 months, but spend most nights texting after the kids have gone to bed. Our dates have been us meeting at a restaurant, park, outdoor mall, etc. and spending the day together. And neither of us knows exactly where the other lives, just the general area from when we've met closer to one of our houses. Or so I thought.

This past weekend we met at a local coffee shop not far from my apartment. When I met him there I never actually told him I had walked there instead of driving. Afterwards, we spent the day at the beach and had a really good time, then he dropped me off back at the coffee shop and we had a great talk later that night. And everything seemed normal, until Monday. When I open my door to rush my daughter to school there is a bouquet of flowers sitting right there. I'm confused and when I look at the note it is from Liam. And my first reaction is not happiness or romance, but fear. How did he know where I lived? Throughout the day he sends coy messages like ""did you have a special morning?"" but I just couldn't respond. Each time a new message arrived it made me feel a little sick. That night he called me as usual and immediately asked if I had a ""surprise"" that day. I asked as flatly as possible ""How do you know where I live?"". He then proudly explains that he was able to figure it out because he didn't see my car at the coffee shop so he knew I walked. One of the photos I had shared with him had my apartment in the background and he was able to figure out which apartment complex was mine from the paint and building style. He couldn't get my exact apartment from the photo, but based on trees and sun angle he was able to narrow it down to 3-4 possible locations in the complex. Early Monday morning he came with the flowers and recognized my car in front of one of the locations and that was when he knew.

At this point he could tell something was wrong and asked if everything was okay. I told him that this was not okay and this act scared me. He immediately apologized and said that wasn't his intent. He went on about something how his mind is constantly looking for puzzles and challenges and how he wanted to do a grand romantic gesture like the movies we have watched. I was not in the right mindset for this and just told him I needed space to think about things and hung up.

As I thought about it more, everything he said does match what I know about him. He is self-proclaimed ""hopeless romantic"", and has done many wonderful gestures for me since we started dating. And one of the things he told me he liked about being a software developer is solving problems. But at the same time, there is a chance it is all a facade and could be a ""psycho stalker"". Even if it is a small chance I'm not sure its worth the risk, for me or my daughter. And even if he is a good person with good intentions, how could he not see how scary that act was to a single mother? How could he be surprised that it would cause this reaction? Just doing it shows he must not have the best judgment.

To his credit he hasn't contacted me since I asked for space. There have been no more apologies or gestures to win me back. But I just don't know what to do next. Up until now everything seemed to be going so well. I am starting to find myself missing our talks, but part of me also still feels fear at who he could be.

Admittedly,  I am a little bummed today. I am 6 months in at my current job after being senior admin of a law firm for many years (the firm closed and I was laid off last summer). I don't particularly like being fussed over so I am okay with not being treated to lunch or coffee or flowers or even a card today, but I am a little disappointed thst even after the CEO of the company I work for sent a company wide 'Happy Admin Day' email with some very kind words, my direct supervisor has yet to even acknowledge the day. Just kind of bumming and feeling underappreciated by the person I report to daily.

That being said, I hope you are all being recognized for all of your hard work and contribution to whatever type of company you work for today. Our role as admin is so important and we are the 'glue' in many ways.

One thing that‚Äôs been consistent is how he always wants to buy new stuff and seems to be very impulsive with money.

We both work full-time, have similar salaries, and keep our finances separate (thankfully), but we split common expenses 50/50. Still, he constantly pushes for new purchases.

For example, he really wanted a high-end espresso machine that cost over $1000. I don‚Äôt really care much ‚Äî instant or fresh, it‚Äôs all the same to me ‚Äî but I agreed. It‚Äôs been only 6-7 months and now he‚Äôs saying we might need a better one because the coffee grounds container is ‚Äútoo small‚Äù (we empty it every 2-3 days, which doesn‚Äôt seem bad to me?).

Same story with our lawn mower ‚Äî he used it several times, said it was terrible and wanted to replace it, so now I mow the lawn just to avoid another expensive ‚Äúsolution.‚Äù

He also maxed out his credit card, and we had to take out a loan together to consolidate his debt (he was rejected applying alone). He promised to pay it back early, but now he‚Äôs maxed his card again and used the savings he had for the loan to invest in stocks ‚Äî his first time doing so ‚Äî saying if it doubles, he‚Äôll pay it off faster. (It hasn't.)

When we order takeout, it‚Äôs the same thing. I often pay double what he does, and when he has no money (because he put everything into stocks), I cover for him and he pays me back a month later after getting paid.

Is this kind of financial irresponsibility or recklessness something common in narcissists? Or is this something else entirely?

TL;DR:
Husband constantly wants new expensive stuff (coffee machine, mower, etc.), maxed out his credit cards, took a loan (with me co-signing), used savings to gamble on stocks, and often leaves me covering expenses like takeout. Wondering if this kind of impulsive, irresponsible spending is typical of narcissists?",1,1745420447.0,NarcissisticSpouses,1,1.0,False
1k61bqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1k61bqc/friendly_psa_on_caffeine/,Friendly PSA on caffeine.,"I see a lot of people ask about caffeine from time to time. There are a lot of benefits to coffee, specifically, and people love that cuppa joe. But a lot of folks have issues with caffeine if you have cPTSD, so here's a bit of the *why* and how to help if you want that cup of coffee from someone who has been dealing with cPTSD for a long time and is also coincidentally a molecular biology person.

**Why caffeine makes us feel bad:** Simplest answer - caffeine triggers a stress response in the body, which leads to a spike in cortisol, the stress hormone. This is much more pronounced in people with nervous system dysregulation (like us). This raises blood pressure, heart rate, energy, etc. This is *great* if you are going to be doing exercise or, you know, running for your life from a bear. *Not great* if you're just trying to have a nice cup of coffee before your work day and already have an over-stimulated nervous system thanks to cPTSD.

**How to make caffeine feel less bad:** Keep the servings small and pair it with food. Also, be liberal with the milk and creamer. Don't drink it straight black, even if that's how you prefer it, unless you pair it with food (especially fat and protein heavy food). If you can't or don't want to consume dairy, try another fat-rich non-dairy option, like oat milk.

**Why these suggestions:** Fat and protein from milk, creamer, or food will help slow down caffeine absorption and help regulate blood sugar, which in turn will help reduce the effects of the cortisol spike.

**What I drink:** 6oz of coffee mixed with equal parts milk and a splash of sweetener. I have learned the equal parts milk is the best ratio for me. This keeps me from feeling wired. Your own ratio may be different and may take time to find.

**And absolutely avoid any caffeine supplements or energy drinks.** For most of us, those are going to throw our nervous systems into complete disarray. I remember I tried an energy drink once. I punched a hole in the wall and had a sobbing breakdown about my mom while raid leading on some MMO in front of a few hundred people. It was not my best moment.",4,1745420435.0,CPTSD,3,1.0,False

""Pull us up, dude!"" Lightning begged.

Cody did as he was instructed to, but his fingers slipped off the cliff and caused all four to plummet to their doom‚Ä¶ until they were saved by Courtney and her hot air balloon.

Owen had his ankle tied to the boom pole. ""David and Goliath, my ankle can't hold on much longer!"" he yelled as they were all taken along for the ride.

""Courtney! Save us! Pull us up!"" Cody pleaded heavily.

Courtney tried to pull the pole, but it didn't budge. ""The pole is stuck! It won't let me pull you up!"" Courtney said with worry.

""We're going to die!"" Lightning freaked out.

""Don't worry. I can save us!"" Owen said seriously and reached out for the pole. Once he grabbed it, the big boy started to climb up, and the three boys hanging onto him didn't let go while they were being dragged alongside him.

Owen managed to hold on to the basket's rope of the hot air balloon. ""Okay, everyone. We're safe for now. And we still have the case!"" Rodney said.

""You might as well throw the case onto the balloon if you don't want it to fall from your hands!"" Courtney suggested, and after careful consideration, Owen hurled the suitcase up in the air, and Courtney was able to catch it and place it down.

Courtney pulled the handle in order to control the balloon more, and as they went past the trees, the boom pole was unintentionally tied onto a bear's leg and brought the animal along.

Owen was the first to witness this. ""Bear!"" he screamed, causing everyone on the balloon to fear for their lives as the bear roared and started to climb on the pole.

The camera cut to the beach below as Katie and Sadie rowed up in their canoe, eyes fixed on the scene unfolding above.

""Is that a hot air balloon and the case?!"" Katie exclaimed.

""I knew it was a good idea to be on the water!"" Sadie added. The two quickly hopped out of their beached canoe and ran into camp.

The scene moved to Dawn and Brick noticing something through the bushes ‚Äì a young moose trying to reach a branch. ""That moose is so cute. Oh, it can't reach the branch,"" Dawn said with sympathy.

""I think I can help out here,"" Brick smiled before jumping onto the top of the branch, allowing it to be on level with the moose and the moose to be happy. ""Here you go, little moose.""

Brick soon lost his standing and crashed onto the moose after slipping off the branch. In the process, the little moose bleated in alarm, and the camera zoomed out to show a large and angry-looking bull moose snorting at the boy.

‚ÄúThis is not what it looks like,‚Äù Brick tried to clear up the misunderstanding to the big moose, and the footage skipped ahead to show Brick and Dawn running and screaming away from the angry moose.

Confessional: Brick

‚ÄúSo I angered the father moose, but I was just trying to help out its child,‚Äù Brick said in the outhouse. ‚ÄúOur best hope is to not get killed by the end of the day.‚Äù

""The case is almost at the campgrounds!"" Chris announced over the loudspeakers. ""Get your butts in gear, people. It's a million big ones!""

The shot cut to Mike's team running through the woods. ""We have to hurry!"" Sky said.

‚ÄúThere has to be a faster way to get there,‚Äù Ella panted.

It was then that Chef drove up alongside them on the red ATV. ""Hey! Any of you punks seen a hot air balloon go by?"" he asked gruffly, stopping as they did. ""Courtney took it from one of our cameramen.""

""Courtney has a hot air balloon?!"" Sky asked. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to win at this rate!‚Äù

""She got the case, too,"" Chef informed them. ""On her way to the finish line."" Mike was shown taking off his shirt, and he transformed into Vito before picking up a large club-like stick off the ground. ""If I had to bet on anyone,"" the cook continued, ""I'd put my-"" He was cut off by a blow to the back of the neck courtesy of Vito, who watched as the hulking man fell to the ground.

Sky and Ella winced while Vito hopped onto the ATV and drove it past them. ""What are you waiting for, ladies?"" he told them. ""Get on!""

The scene went to Sadie and Katie running. ""Do you know where they could have landed?‚Äù Sadie landed.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Katie said.

A cry of ""RUUUNNN!"" coming up behind them got their attention, and the duo stopped in their tracks and looked back just in time to see Dawn and Brick running for their lives.

""From what?"" Sadie asked in confusion before they gasped and the two began to flee as well, the angry bull moose appearing moments later in chase.

The scene cut to the balloon drifting over the campgrounds, Courtney still in the basket while Owen, Lightning, Rodney, Cody, and the brown bear clung to the dangling microphone cord.

""Hurry, guys!"" Owen shouted in a panic as Cody was steadily climbing upwards. The bear growled and swiped at Owen's butt, tearing away a small piece of his shorts and exposing his bare bottom, though it was pixelated. The big guy yelped at this, but managed to haul himself up with the rest.

""That was a close one,"" Cody breathed a sigh of relief as he untied the rope.

""Thanks for not letting us die, Courtney,"" Owen told her.

""I was expecting just me and Duncan to have the money, but we'll share it one-sixth,"" Courtney bargained.

""That's good enough for Lightning,"" Lightning said. ""Deal?""

""We would be dead if it wasn't for your hot air balloon, so we'll share the money,"" Cody confirmed.

The camera cut to the beach below as Harold and Heather arrived, eyes fixed on the scene above.

""Is that a hot air balloon?!"" Harold asked.

""They've got the case and a bear!"" Heather made note and they got off their canoe. ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù

The shot cut to the forest, where Sky, Ella, and Mike, now with his shirt on, were on the ATV. The vehicle hit a rock in front of them and they flew up with a yelp before the ATV landed and drove normally again.

""I can't stop this ATV!"" Mike yelled. They then reached the campgrounds at high speed towards Heather and Harold, who both saw the vehicle and dashed the other way as the ATV chased them all the way down the dock and into the water.

The five teens surfaced on the lake. ""That was crazy!"" Heather sputtered.

""That was awesome!"" Harold admitted.

""Attention campers!"" Chris announced, once again via the camp's loudspeakers. ""The case is still in play! Don't give up now!""

A flash took the focus to Jo, running through the forest with a determined expression. ""I was suckered out of that money,"" she muttered to herself. ""Now I have to find a way to get back in the game, and fast!"" She spotted something nearby, and the camera panned over to show the Arts and Crafts Center.

""Wait a minute,"" the jock-ette said, skidding to a halt in front of the shack. The camera's point-of-view moved to inside the small building as Jo kicked the door open, stared for a moment, and broke into a grin. ""Yes!"" she exclaimed excitedly as the viewpoint moved back over her shoulder, showing the gleaming red-and-chrome motorcycle that had been stored inside the Arts and Crafts Center.

""Just need to find the key,"" she said as she began to look around the room, moving things aside and tossing them behind her until she found a small brass key hidden under a coffee can. She held it up to her grinning face, and the footage skipped forward to her putting it in the ignition.

Its engine roared to life. Jo laughed, hopping on the bike and turning it to the shack's open door.

The scene cut to Noah inside the boathouse. ""Tell me why we're doing this again?"" he asked.

‚ÄúI feel kind of dumb!‚Äù Eva muttered.

Shawn came up to the camera's view while looking back at his allies. ‚ÄúBecause that way, she won't see us coming. Now remember,‚Äù the conspiracy nut gave a bucket to Noah and Eva, ‚Äúwhen you see Jo, fire this at her, and then, we‚Äôll take the case back,‚Äù he finished with a bucket in hand. ‚ÄúGot it?!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe got it,‚Äù Noah said.

Confessional: Shawn

‚ÄúIf only we had icing around for another plan,‚Äù Shawn confessed. ‚ÄúBakers have been hiding in plain sight covered in icing camouflage since, like, the dawn of time! At least that's what my old boss at the bakery used to tell me. Mind you, he also said the pyramids were built by pastry chefs, so...‚Äù

Confessional Ends

The shot cut to the washrooms‚Äô exterior. It zoomed in to show Shawn, Noah, and Eva looking out from behind until Dawn, Brick, Katie, and Sadie ran past them, the moose still chasing them. ""Get back!"" Shawn ordered the team to hide behind.

""The pool ladder! Let‚Äôs climb up there!"" Dawn shouted as the camera focused on them running before reaching the ladder. Katie and Sadie climbed up first, and Dawn and Brick followed after. The moose ran off into another direction once the teens were no longer in sight.

Duncan arrived at the scene. ""What the heck... What are you guys doing up there?!""

The four that got chased pointed to the moose, and Duncan looked behind him. ‚ÄúOh no!‚Äù He screamed, and ran away while the moose huffed and gave chase to him.

The camera followed them as they ran into the main lodge. The moose soon went from the chaser to the chased as Duncan scared it with a trophy moose head.

""MOO!"" Duncan shouted to frighten the moose as they departed.

Katie, Sadie, Dawn, and Brick were now on the board. Brick then saw the hot air balloon coming near them. ""Incoming!""

""We're going to hit!"" Owen screamed, and he and the passengers‚Äô fright increased as the bear started to grab onto the basket.

""We have to jump for it!"" Lightning told the passengers in the balloon.

""We'll all die! Are you crazy?!"" Owen refused to do so.

""He's right! It's the only way!"" Cody sided with the uber-jock. ""On the count of three! One! Two! Three!""

With the exception of Courtney, who held onto the money, the boys got off the balloon and landed on the diving board with the other four. It tilted sideways at first, but it gained its balance back quickly.

Courtney looked at the case. ""I guess they don‚Äôt-"" She felt the bear tapping her, causing her to look back. ‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù

Seeing the danger she was in, Courtney jumped off the balloon, leaving the bear to fly away with the balloon now.

Courtney got in-between those that were chased by the moose and those that were recently riding with her, and a scuffle over who should get the suitcase ensued.

Down below, Sky rushed to the ladder. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let the suitcase get away!‚Äù She climbed up and tried to grab the case as soon as she was on the diving board, only for it to slip away.

‚ÄúNOOO!‚Äù the contestants all cried out when the case fell down and landed in front of the washrooms as Lindsay's team came out the door.

‚ÄúAnd I was like, ""Yes! You can wear pink with red,"" and she was like, ""No you can't!"",‚Äù Lindsay told them a story and saw the case. ‚ÄúWow, that's a pretty case. So anyway, I-‚Äù

""It's the case!"" Beth smiled as soon as she saw it on the ground.

""Move it or lose it!"" a determined cry sounded, the three watching as Jo, on top of the roaring flame-detailed motorcycle she'd found earlier, drove into view.

""What the-"" Chris said in front of the monitors back at Playa Des Losers.

""My bike!"" Chef Hatchet exclaimed. ""I knew I shoulda hidden that key better!""

As Jo was driving faster and faster, Ezekiel, Beth, and Lindsay ran away screaming, leaving the case on the floor. She came to a stop and got off the motorcycle, picking up the case with her hand. ‚ÄúNow to get to the dock!‚Äù

''Not so fast!'' Shawn called, coming from behind the washroom. ''NOW!'' he yelled before Eva and Noah appeared on top of the washrooms and poured buckets of fish guts at Jo.

‚ÄúFish guts?!'' Jo groaned at the water and fish that doused her. ‚ÄúSeriously?!''

''You should try this!'' Shawn shouted before he put a pail of chum on her head and ran off with the case. ‚ÄúI'm a millionaire! Zombie-proof bunker, here I come!''

The beanie boy failed to see a rock in the grass, causing him to trip over it and he saw the case bounce off again.

Back at the washrooms, Duncan was shown running after the case while Jo began to walk around as she could not see. ‚ÄúSomeone get this bucket off my head!‚Äù she demanded obliviously.

The campers on the diving board gasped in terror when the structure finally fell apart. Sadie, Sky, Courtney, Cody, and Rodney fell into the pool while Brick, Dawn, Katie, Lightning, and Owen slid along the ground on part of the diving board after getting a speed boost from the piece of the airplane wing leaning against the pool.

Jo was walking around trying to get the bucket off of her head, and the campers on the diving board took her along with them, the bucket getting off of her head.

They all got to the dock as Lindsay, Ezekiel, Beth, Shawn, and Duncan were also present. The contestants on the diving board plowed everyone into the water, including Harold, Heather, Ella, and Mike, who were trying to get back up. The force of the crash startled Chris, who was watching from above in a helicopter along with Chef.

Shawn was the first one to surface from the lake. He frantically looked around for the case and saw it floating on the lake, and it was promptly swallowed whole by a man-eating freshwater shark. A gull swimming nearby laughed, only to be eaten itself moments later.

""Great!"" Jo shouted angrily. ""Now what?!""

The sound of footsteps on the dock got everyone's attention, and the camera showed Chris already off the helicopter and Chef flying out of sight, the host stepped towards the fifteen floating campers ‚Äì Katie, Lightning, Owen, Dawn, Brick, Jo, Duncan, Shawn, Beth, Lindsay, Ezekiel, Heather, Harold, Ella, and Mike.

""Soooo,"" Chris told them, ""you lost the case! Way to gooo. I didn't wanna have to do this,"" he put his hands on his hips, ""but since none of the fifteen of you officially won, you all officially tie. Which means,"" he grinned, ""that you will all have another shot at winning the million dollars!"" He paused as they cheered off-camera before adding ""In season two!""

Confessional: Dawn

‚ÄúA season second?"" Dawn asked.

Confessional: Heather

""Uh-uh. No way. I am not coming back here,"" Heather refused.

Confessional: Lindsay

‚ÄúSeason two?! Season two?!‚Äù Lindsay exclaimed happily. ‚ÄúI'm gonna be so much more famous than I thought! I hope I have a chance to get my roots done first.‚Äù

Confessionals End

""Oh, forget this!"" Duncan glared at the host. ""I did not agree to season two!""

""Actually, you did,"" Chris told him. ""It's called the fine print. Read it, live it, love it!""

Ezekiel groaned to himself. ""I don't want to compete again, but fine,"" the homeschooler said in defeat.

The focus moved back to the dock as Chris addressed the seven campers not in the lake: Sadie, Sky, Courtney, Cody, Rodney, Noah, and Eva. ""As for the rest of you,"" Chris told them, ""your treasure hunt ends here!"" He gave them a smug look. ""Along with all your hopes of ever winning any money off of being on this show!"" Eva glared at him and Noah frowned in disappointment as the host continued to speak. ""The good news, though? You'll be watching all the action on season two, from the sidelines!""

""Wait a minute!"" Courtney protested. ""I wanna be on season!""

""Tut, tut, tut, tut!"" Chris told her impishly. ""Fine print!""

Confessional: Courtney

""Oh, that is it!"" Courtney said in the confessional. ""If they thought they were in trouble before, they're in huge trouble now!""

Confessional: Harold

""Another season? Sweet! Another chance to showcase my mad skills! Hi-yah!"" Harold tried to perform a karate move, but hit his elbow on the wall and felt pain. ""Funny bone! That is funny,"" he laughed a bit before groaning in pain.

Confessional: Katie/Sadie

""Yay! We get to stay for another season!"" Sadie cheered while holding Katie's hand.

""You only get to watch though,"" Katie reminded. ‚ÄúI'll be the one competing.‚Äù

""That's okay. I'd watch at home anyway,"" Sadie humbly said.

""Oh yeah, that's true! Wish me luck!"" Katie told her friend before they squealed joyfully.

Confessionals End

The footage cut back in to Lightning grinning in the water. ""Oh yeah!"" he cheered. ""One more sha-chance at the gold, and this time, Lightning's going all the way to the endzone!‚Äù

""This is so exciting!"" Beth said to Lindsay. ""Lindsay, if you win and you buy France, will you invite me over?""

""For sure!"" Lindsay promised.

""In exactly two weeks,"" Chris McLean announced, ""you will all report to a brand-new location, for a whole new challenge! And, the last one standing will receive one million dollars!"" He looked straight at the camera. ""So don't forget to tune in,"" he held up a film slate and raised the clapstick, ""to Total! Drama! Action!"" On the final word, he clapped the stick and grinned.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best holiday gift sets stand out due to their quality, variety, and presentation.

**High-Quality Products:** The foundation of any great gift set is the quality of the individual items it contains.

This means using premium ingredients for skincare and beauty sets, durable materials for home goods, and authentic flavors for gourmet food selections. High-quality products not only ensure a satisfying experience for the recipient but also reflect the giver's thoughtfulness.

**Thoughtful Curation:** A well-curated gift set tells a story or caters to a specific theme or interest.

Instead of simply throwing together random items, the best sets feature products that complement each other and enhance the overall experience. For example, a coffee lover's gift set might include artisanal coffee beans, a stylish mug, and gourmet biscotti, all working together to create a delightful coffee ritual.

**Attractive Presentation:** First impressions matter, and the presentation of a gift set can significantly impact its perceived value and desirability.

Beautifully designed packaging, such as elegant boxes, ribbons, and tissue paper, adds an extra layer of luxury and excitement to the unboxing experience. Attention to detail in presentation shows that care and effort went into selecting the gift.

**Variety and Value:** A good gift set offers a variety of items that provide a comprehensive experience and represents excellent value for money.

This means including a range of products that allow the recipient to explore different aspects of a particular theme or interest. Additionally, the total value of the individual items should exceed the price of the gift set, making it a smart and economical choice for shoppers.

**Customization Options:** The ability to personalize a gift set adds a personal touch and makes the gift even more meaningful.

Some brands offer customization options, such as allowing customers to choose specific scents, colors, or flavors for certain products. This level of personalization shows that the giver has put extra thought and effort into creating a unique and special gift.

**Sustainable Practices:** Increasingly, consumers are seeking out eco-friendly and sustainable products.

Gift sets that prioritize sustainable packaging, ethically sourced ingredients, and environmentally conscious production practices are highly desirable. This not only reduces the environmental impact of the gift but also aligns with the values of many modern consumers.

 ## Core Benefits

Holiday gift sets provide a range of benefits for both the giver and the recipient.

**Convenience and Time Savings:** Shopping for individual gifts can be time-consuming and stressful, especially during the busy holiday season. Gift sets offer a convenient solution by providing a curated selection of items in one package.

This saves shoppers the hassle of searching for multiple gifts and ensures that the items complement each other. Gift sets are a perfect option for those who want to give a thoughtful gift without spending hours browsing through stores or online retailers.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** Gift sets often offer a better value compared to purchasing individual items separately. Brands typically bundle products together at a discounted price, making gift sets an economical choice for shoppers.

This allows consumers to give a generous and impressive gift without breaking the bank. The cost savings can be significant, especially for higher-end brands and luxury items.

**Exposure to New Products:** Gift sets provide an opportunity for recipients to discover new brands and products that they might not have otherwise tried.

This is particularly beneficial for beauty, skincare, and gourmet food sets, where recipients can sample different items and find new favorites. Exposure to new products can lead to long-term customer loyalty for the brands featured in the gift set.

**Reduced Decision Fatigue:** The sheer volume of products available during the holiday season can lead to decision fatigue, making it difficult to choose the perfect gift. Gift sets simplify the decision-making process by offering a curated selection of options.

This eliminates the need to compare countless individual items and reduces the stress associated with holiday shopping. Gift sets provide a pre-packaged solution that takes the guesswork out of gift-giving.

**Perfect for Hard-to-Shop-For Individuals:** Everyone has someone on their list who is notoriously difficult to shop for. Gift sets offer a versatile solution for these individuals by providing a variety of items that cater to a range of interests.

This increases the likelihood that the recipient will find something they love within the set. Gift sets are a safe and thoughtful option for those who are unsure of the recipient's preferences or specific needs.

1k61689,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1k61689/did_i_overreact/,Did I overreact?,"The other day I confided in my best friend about an argument between my husband and his sister that got quite heated (not violent, just raised voices) because I was scared at the time. Fast forward a week and she text me that she wants to hang out. I'm heavily pregnant now, and my family (husband + in-laws) were out, so I said if she wants to meet up then it would help me a lot if she comes to mine while I finish up cooking and then we look for a coffee shop close by. Her reply was simply, ""With all that yelling?""

No-one needs to explain to me why someone might not want to walk into a tense house. Duh, no brainer. But this is my best friend of nearly a decade and I have never once invited her over when there's been any tension. I usually go to her place because it's more convenient for her and if I do invite her to mine, it's been when there's no-one else home. So when I read this reply... I kinda snapped. I told her, ""Nah it's alright, not really in the right headspace for hanging out anymore"", and when she asked why, I said I found her comment insensitive. I reminded her I've never invited her into a hostile or dangerous environment and never would so, honestly, it felt like she's casually saying it just because she didn't want to make the long journey in my direction. I didn't like that she turned something I confided in her into a matter of her own comfort/convenience and I let her know I am at my absolute lowest right now so I really think it's better if we rearrange for some other time. 

My reaction wasn't just a response to that though. She's someone with an extremely low tolerance for other people's issues but she'll call me over every single minor detail on her life like I'm her personal, emotional dumping ground. Like after my work contract was illegally terminated, I was fighting a lawsuit and facing homelessness, she called me in tears because she, at the tender age of 27, can't afford a 10k new kitchen and feels ""behind in life"". Girl, read the room. Some of it's been about as tone deaf as telling a homeless guy how hard it's been finding a trustworthy builder to install the new swimming pool.

But yeah, this rubbed me the wrong way cos I have truly gone out of my way NOT to dump the misery that is my daily life on this friend, and it's like at the first opportunity she used something that took me a lot of courage and hesitation to share, and made it about her. Maybe she really was worried about coming to my place, idk, it's just hard to give her the benefit of the doubt considering we pretty much always meet when and where is convenient for her. Say, for example, I'm sick - don't even think about meeting up, she doesn't want to catch it. But if she's sick? Happy to ask you to pop over and run errands for her. So yeah, this did just feel like another, ""That's too much effort for me, how can I get out of it?"" remark.

There was a little more to our exchange - mostly her deflecting and even twisting some of what I'd said (""I wanted some sunshine. If you just wanted me to keep you company at yours and not go out, why didn't you say that?"" - uhh cos that's not what I wanted, hence not what I said), and the interesting thing is I haven't heard back from her AT ALL since then. She's asked me in the past why I never reach out to her when I'm really struggling, and I've always said it's just not my thing... But really it's to avoid disappointment. And now that I told her I'm genuinely at my lowest? Radio silence.

Idk, was I being unreasonable? Should I reach out and apologise or wait and see if she bothers to check in with me? I feel pretty let down by the lack of support she's shown when I've been going through so much, not just on this occasion but a few times over the years when it's really mattered. But I'd also be totally isolated without her so a part of me feels like I should just try to make amends. I'm just not sure I really overreacted...

1k615wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superfunnystories/comments/1k615wr/the_great_sock_heist_of_2025/,The Great Sock Heist of 2025,"# ‚Äã

It all started one fateful Tuesday when Jeremy realized he had lost yet another sock. He wasn‚Äôt one of those people who lost socks in the laundry; oh no, Jeremy had a *methodical* approach to laundry. Socks went in pairs, folded neatly, and placed in his dresser with military precision. But, every week, at least one sock would go missing.

This time, though, Jeremy had had enough. He wasn‚Äôt just going to sit back and accept the Sock Thief‚Äôs tyranny any longer. He declared war.

He gathered his friends: Kyle, the guy who could fix anything with duct tape; Alice, the conspiracy theorist; and Greg, who was just along for the free snacks. Together, they formed the ""Sock Investigation Taskforce"" (S.I.T.). Armed with nothing but snacks, coffee, and a lot of confused looks from their neighbors, they began their operation.

Kyle rigged a hidden camera inside Jeremy‚Äôs laundry basket, Alice set up a perimeter of aluminum foil (to reflect psychic sock-stealing rays), and Greg‚Ä¶ ate snacks. They waited.

Hours passed. Nothing.

Then, just as Alice started ranting about how the socks were probably taken by an alien race, the camera caught something. A *shadow*. A sneaky, suspicious figure creeping toward the laundry room at 2 AM.

They rushed to the monitor, holding their breath. The figure finally emerged from the laundry room‚Ä¶ It was Jeremy‚Äôs cat, Mr. Whiskers, wearing the missing sock as a cape.

""HE‚ÄôS BEEN THE SOCK THIEF THIS WHOLE TIME?!"" shouted Alice, pointing dramatically at the screen.

The cat strutted through the living room, tail high, looking like he had just won an award for ""Best Cat in a Sock.""

The team sat in stunned silence. Then, Jeremy just burst out laughing.

""Well, I guess I owe Mr. Whiskers an apology‚Ä¶ and a new sock.""

And from that day on, the Sock Heist of 2025 became the most legendary event in their group‚Äôs history. Every time they got together, they couldn‚Äôt help but talk about the day the socks weren‚Äôt stolen‚Ä¶ they were *stolen by a cat*.‚Äã",1,1745420038.0,Superfunnystories,0,1.0,False
1k615pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1k615pg/we_built_an_ai_marketing_tool_for_ecommerce_and/,"We Built an AI Marketing Tool for E-commerce, and After 3 Months of Iterating (and Some Brutal Feedback), We Hit 10k Daily Users. Now We‚Äôre Going Fully Paid‚ÄîWish Us Luck!","Hey Reddit! I‚Äôve been dying to share the rollercoaster story of PhotoG, an AI marketing tool we built from scratch for e-commerce and brands. It‚Äôs been 3 months of grinding, tweaking, and begging for feedback‚Äîand somehow, we‚Äôve hit 10k daily active users. But here‚Äôs the big news: we‚Äôre switching to a fully paid model. I‚Äôm equal parts excited and terrified, so I‚Äôd love to hear what you think!
What‚Äôs PhotoG All About?
PhotoG is an AI-powered marketing agent that takes a product image and a simple prompt (like ‚Äúmake this pop for TikTok‚Äù) and spits out a full marketing kit:
Eye-catching images
Short videos
3D product models
Ad copy
E-commerce pages
SEO-optimized titles and descriptions
It‚Äôs got built-in editing tools too, so you can tweak everything without hiring a designer. Think of it as a one-person marketing department in your browser.
The Rough Start
When we launched, it was dead silent. No users, no buzz‚Äîjust me staring at my screen, wondering if I‚Äôd wasted months of my life. Here‚Äôs how we clawed our way out:
Constant updates: We pushed new features weekly, based on whatever feedback we could get our hands on.
Real-world testing: I dragged friends, local shop owners, and random coffee shop strangers into focus groups. They tore it apart‚Äîtoo clunky, too slow‚Äîand we fixed it.
First believers: A handful of e-commerce folks tried it for free and gave us killer insights, like ‚Äúthe videos rock, but the SEO needs work.‚Äù That‚Äôs when things started turning.
The Win: 10k Users and Counting
Fast forward 3 months, and we‚Äôre finally humming:
Word spread: Early users loved the ‚Äúsolo marketing team‚Äù vibe and told their friends.
Solid stats: People spend 5+ minutes per session, and 15% come back daily. For a tool like this, that‚Äôs huge.
Real impact: One small brand slashed their marketing costs by 70% and doubled their Instagram engagement with PhotoG. That‚Äôs when I realized we‚Äôd built something legit.
The Pricing Leap: Free ‚Üí Freemium ‚Üí Fully Paid
Here‚Äôs the juicy part. We started free to get traction, dipped our toes into freemium to test the waters, and now we‚Äôre going all-in on a paid model. Why?
Keeping the lights on: Servers and AI upgrades aren‚Äôt cheap, and we want to keep pushing the tool forward.
Fair value: PhotoG saves users thousands in marketing costs‚Äîcharging for it feels right.
User nudge: Some folks even asked for premium features like faster renders and deeper customization.
But let‚Äôs not kid ourselves‚Äîthis could backfire. I‚Äôve seen tools tank after going paid. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here, spilling the beans and hoping you‚Äôll weigh in.

I initially thought, ""Do I really need another coffee maker?"" But after testing it through several workdays and lazy Sunday mornings, I quickly realized why this little machine earned its spot on my counter. Designed for small households, couples, or even a one-person caffeine-driven mission, this compact coffee maker delivers on style and functionality.

**Appealing Design and Compactness**

The design hits all the right notes. It's minimalistic yet modern, with stainless steel and black accents that blend seamlessly into any kitchen setting. Measuring 5.71 x 8.07 x 10.08 inches, it doesn‚Äôt hog counter space, making it perfect for smaller kitchens or cozy office setups. I appreciate its lightweight build ‚Äì at just 2.78 pounds, it‚Äôs easy to move or store when needed. This coffee maker is certainly a fit for anyone tight on space but unwilling to compromise on aesthetics.

**Efficient Performance and Brewing Capabilities**

Brewing up to 5 cups at once, this machine is ideal for one to two coffee-loving individuals. For me, it‚Äôs enough to kickstart busy mornings and still leave room for a second cup. One feature I love is the Pause & Brew option, which pauses the brewing process if I need a quick cup immediately. No mess or dripping spills, and I can get my caffeine fix early without waiting for the whole pot to finish brewing. Small but mighty ‚Äì it gets the job done efficiently, and that‚Äôs a win in my book.

**Ease of Use and Thoughtful Features**

Operating this coffee maker is as straightforward as it gets: a single on/off button controls the entire process. The water tank, with its top fill design and visible level indicator, is simple to manage. The included measuring spoon ensures I get my coffee-to-water ratio right every time. Add in the permanent, reusable filter, and we're talking about a waste-reducing setup that‚Äôs easy on my wallet and the environment. As someone who has ruined mornings fumbling with confusing coffee maker settings, this simplicity felt like a game-changer.

**Upsides**

- Stylish and modern design fits in small spaces beautifully.  
- Pause & Brew function allows convenient mid-brew coffee pouring.  
- Reusable filter reduces costs and environmental waste.  

**Cleaning Simplified**

I can‚Äôt stress enough how much I hate tedious cleanup routines for appliances. Thankfully, the effort to maintain this coffee machine is minimal. The stainless steel exterior cleans up in seconds with a quick wipe, and both the carafe and permanent filter are dishwasher-safe. The drip-free spout is a lifesaver too ‚Äì no more fighting sticky or damp countertops after pouring coffee. This makes those rushed mornings a bit more manageable.

**Caveats**

- Brewing capacity may feel limited for larger households or gatherings.  
- The Keep Warm function only extends up to 30 minutes, which could be a downside for those who drink coffee more slowly.  

**Competitive Options**

While there‚Äôs no shortage of coffee machines on the market, this product competes closely with brands like Mr. Coffee and BLACK+DECKER. Compared to Mr. Coffee, which sometimes lacks the compactness and Pause & Brew feature, this machine feels better suited for small households or tighter spaces. BLACK+DECKER machines, on the other hand, sometimes provide larger carafe capacities but sacrifice stylish aesthetics. The KRUPS model edges out its competitors for those who value simplicity and premium design over sheer brewing volume.

**Smart Spending**

When I think about the features versus the price, this coffee maker honestly hits a sweet spot. You‚Äôre not just buying a coffee maker; you‚Äôre investing in a sleek, functional appliance that simplifies your routine. Factor in the reduced need for paper filters and the energy-efficient Keep Warm function, and you‚Äôve got yourself an excellent choice that doesn‚Äôt break the bank.

1k611ky,https://i.redd.it/7tfr8mhzklwe1.jpeg,Please help me with my lounge/dining layout!,"Floor plan of my lounge/dining attached (can‚Äôt send it here due to upload limit). The photo cuts off just before the kitchen island begins. Next to the small diagonal wall is the hallway entrance.

Currently, my TV and stand are in the far corner, between the window and sliding door, angled diagonally. I have two 2-seater couches forming a sort of L-shape (like a half-diamond) facing the TV, with a coffee table in the middle, creating a defined square ‚Äúlounge‚Äù zone.

In the top-right corner near the kitchen, I‚Äôve placed my large square dining table, but it feels a bit cramped next to the island. I work from home and game at this dining table and it feels odd being able to knock elbows with my kitchen while doing so. 

To the left of the front door, I have a tall bookshelf facing diagonally and a short/wide bookshelf along the wall beside it, with a giant beanbag in front of them. This forms a cozy reading corner, but it feels a little awkward being right at the entrance.

What I‚Äôm thinking of doing:
	‚Ä¢	Move the bookshelves and beanbag to the far corner where the TV and couches are now.
	‚Ä¢	Then center the TV under the heat pump (on the wall between the window and hallway).
	‚Ä¢	Position the couches facing each other, perpendicular to the TV (rather than angled), with the coffee table in between. That way the couches create more of a balanced conversation space, and the TV is still viewable.
	‚Ä¢	This could open more access to the sliding door, give the reading nook more of a tucked in feel, and free up space near the dining area, so I can move the dining table a bit away from the kitchen island.

Any thoughts on this idea would be much appreciated! I‚Äôm slightly concerned about having the couches facing eachother instead of the TV, because even though it‚Äôs still in view it would be less comfortable for long viewing sessions but better for the harmony of the room and for social events. Also having the main living area/couches so close to the front door? Do we hate that? Thank you in advance! ",2,1745419731.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False
1k6115d,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1k6115d/sources_for_refill_policy_2025/,Sources for Refill Policy 2025,"I occasionally like to sit at Starbucks to work. I hadn't gone for awhile and when I went last month, I was denied a free refill because I didn't have a personal cup (my bad!) - and because my initial order was a latte. I brushed up on the policy and have zero problem bringing my own cup. 

However, nothing in the [official Starbucks policy](https://about.starbucks.com/backtostarbucks/) seems to clarify whether you're eligible for a refill of hot or iced brewed coffee or tea **regardless of what your first drink is**. I know in the past, if I ordered a latte, I could get a free refill of an iced tea while I was still in store. I can't imagine why that wouldn't still be the case, but I can't find anywhere in the official Starbucks policy that actually references it. Any ideas? 

I also wish there was clarification on whether mobile orders are allowed refill - ie. if I mobile order, drink in store with my personal cup, and then request a refill while still in store. It seems like this should be ok, but again, I've gotten pushback on this too and can't find anything that actually supports this.

Can anyone point me to resources on either of these points that I can reference when requesting a refill?(or- if I'm totally wrong I will accept that too!)",2,1745419697.0,starbucks,3,0.75,False
1k6113e,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1k6113e/random_advice_drinking_coffee/,"Random advice , drinking coffee","What I noticed worked well for me was drinking coffee after every meal, with or without suger and milk to get my metabolism to start working . 

And it keeps me energy up after eating. Don't drink coffee after every meal if you have a hard time sleeping at night if you drink too late. 

One cup after lunch and a ""fika"" aka cup of coffee around 15 is really good , in my opinion of course :) 

Energy drinks don't have the same effect so I don't recommend it and it's not good for you 

EDIT: to clarify 15 does NOT mean 15 cups of coffee, I hope everyone understands that. I mean the time 15 ",0,1745419694.0,WeightLossAdvice,9,0.25,False

1k60yfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1k60yfj/it_started_small/,It Started Small,"It started last Thursday.
Nothing big. The hallway light was off when he got up to use the bathroom. He was almost certain he‚Äôd left it on. But maybe not. Maybe he‚Äôd just thought about it and never actually flipped the switch. It was late. He was tired.

The next morning, he found the coffee canister in the fridge. He never put it there. Still, people make little mistakes all the time. He laughed at himself, shook his head, and moved on.

Then the garage door was open. Wide open. He hadn‚Äôt even gone outside the day before. He stood at the doorway for a while, trying to remember locking it, trying to picture himself turning the key. He couldn‚Äôt. But memory gets fuzzy. That‚Äôs normal. That‚Äôs what he told himself.

Soon, it was something new every day. A drawer left open. A shirt in the laundry he didn‚Äôt remember wearing. Water running in the bathroom when he hadn‚Äôt been in there. He started checking the locks before bed. He started writing little notes to himself.

One evening, he walked into the kitchen and found a man standing by the sink.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù he asked.

The man turned around, calm. ‚ÄúI live here.‚Äù

Panic crawled up his spine.

‚ÄúNo, you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

The man just walked past him, didn‚Äôt even look twice.

He didn‚Äôt sleep much after that.

The next morning, all the picture frames were different. Not just rearranged, the actual photos. New people. Strangers. A child he didn‚Äôt recognize smiling at a woman he‚Äôd never met. He stared at it for a long time, waiting for the memory to come.

It didn‚Äôt.

Then came the morning when he woke up and the entire house felt wrong. The air smelled off. The floors seemed too cold. The hallway was longer than it should‚Äôve been. The sofa wasn‚Äôt where it was supposed to be. He opened cabinets and didn‚Äôt recognize the dishes. The silverware was too heavy.

He sat down in the middle of the living room and stared at the walls like they might move if he watched long enough.

A knock at the door broke the silence.

A woman stepped in, clipboard in hand, gentle voice.

‚ÄúHi. I‚Äôm with home care. Your daughter called. You‚Äôve been confused lately.‚Äù

He looked at her.

She spoke slowly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been showing signs of dementia. But it‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôre here to help.‚Äù

He turned back to the living room.

He didn‚Äôt know this place. He didn‚Äôt know the couch. Or the photos. Or the air. It wasn‚Äôt his.

But everyone else was so sure it was.

And that was the worst part.

1k60xtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k60xtr/pro_tip_if_your_partner_likes_milk_drinks_but_not/,"Pro tip: if your partner likes milk drinks but not a strong coffee flavour, try to find older specialty beans at a grocery store.","This might be super-specific to my area, but it's been helpful for me. My wife loves lattes with syrups, grated chocolate, and loads of milk, and can't drink straight espresso. I don't judge her choices because I'm one of them. üòÅ

So instead of trying to mask the flavour of coffee, I discovered all the supermarkets around us have a little ""specialty"" section tucked at the end of the coffee aisle which sell bags from local roasters (some of the same brands I buy at specialty shops nearby, one actually 15 minutes from the supermarket itself), but which are ~6 months past roast date.

Obviously not ideal for espresso, but that lack of flavour from older beans is great for a milk drink that's still caffeinated and has a _hint_ of coffee flavour, without being too strong. And I'm happy to support a local roaster and good coffee-buying practices by helping use up their older stock, and show grocery chains that something besides Maxwell House will still sell.

Bonus: they're cheaper too, I'm paying about $15-18 CAD for a 12oz bag, compared to $20-30 for the same bag freshly roasted.",0,1745419471.0,espresso,11,0.5,False

**Why This Pick?**

I fully expect yet another painfully low-scoring affair here that boasts exceptional defense from both squads. The Rockets and the Warriors have cashed the Under in their last 5 straight meetings ‚Äì all 5 barely cracking 200 points. With Houston having figured out how to keep Golden State in check (I‚Äôm still in awe of their ability to hold Steph Curry to 3 points back on April 6th‚Ä¶), I‚Äôm on the Under to hit, friends.

1k60vie,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k60vie/explore_if_igloo_countertop_ice_maker_lives_up_to/,Explore if Igloo Countertop Ice Maker Lives Up to Expectation in This Review,"The Igloo IGLICEB33SL Electric Countertop Ice Maker Machine has been my go-to solution for keeping drinks cold during gatherings, work-from-home coffee breaks, and even summer road trips in the RV. As someone who appreciates convenience combined with functionality, this portable ice maker caught my eye with its promise of churning out up to 33 pounds of ice in just 24 hours. After putting it to the test in various settings, there's a lot to love‚Äîbut also a few things to consider before committing.

**Compact Design Suited for Any Space**  
What struck me first was how sleek yet compact this countertop ice maker is. Measuring just 14.17""D x 9.65""W x 11.61""H with an aesthetic silver finish, it fits neatly on my kitchen counter without adding clutter. The design blends nicely with modern appliances, and the portability factor is honestly a huge bonus. I‚Äôve used it not just at home but in my RV and even on a countertop at the office during a recent team event. The transparent lid is a cool touch too‚Äîit lets me easily peek to see how much ice is left without opening it.

**Easy Setup Means Instant Gratification**  
Getting started was refreshingly simple. No installation required‚Äîjust plug it in, add water to the 2.5-quart tank, select the ice-cube size, and wait. Within 7 minutes, I had 9 cylinder-shaped ice cubes waiting for me. I chose the larger cube setting, which I found perfect for iced coffee since it melts slower on hot days. The small cube option worked well for cocktails when I tested it during a weekend gathering with friends.

**Check [Igloo IGLICEB33SL] deals on Amazon now.**  

**Features That Make Entertaining Easier**  
A couple of features instantly stood out. First, the included removable basket can hold up to 2 pounds of ice, making refills efficient and hassle-free. Transferring ice to cups, pitchers, or even my cooler while camping was made even easier with the included scoop. These thoughtful touches add convenience, which I truly appreciate. Plus, the electronic control panel is super easy to use. The illuminated LED indicators are impossible to miss‚Äîthey alert you when water needs to be added or when the ice basket is full.

**Highlights of the Igloo Ice Maker**  
- Compact and portable size makes it easy to move between rooms, RVs, or outdoor spaces.  
- Quick ice production: Ready in about 7 minutes.  
- Two ice cube sizes to suit different needs‚Äîsmall for cocktails, large for slower melting in coffee or tea.  
- The removable ice basket and included scoop make serving neat and simple.  

**Control Panel Simplicity**  
Sometimes, gadgets come with complicated interfaces, but this ice maker keeps it clean and straightforward. With clearly labeled buttons and bright indicator lights, even my not-so-tech-savvy friends found it easy to get the hang of. By the way, it‚Äôs impressively quiet during operation‚Äîbarely noticeable in the background, even when used in the living room.

**Areas That Could Improve**  
While this machine checks most boxes, there are a few quirks to mention. The constant need to refill the water tank can test your patience during heavy use. I‚Äôve also noticed that the ice cubes tend to clump together if left sitting in the basket for too long, which calls for some manual breaking apart. Lastly, it doesn‚Äôt come with any auto-cleaning options, so I do find myself spending more time than I‚Äôd like rinsing and drying the interior to prevent water buildup.

**Limitations**  
- The water tank needs frequent refills during long sessions.  
- Ice in the basket can sometimes clump if left unused for extended periods.  
- Lacks an auto-cleaning function, requiring more manual maintenance.  

**Competitive Options**  
Now onto the competitors. I‚Äôve tested similar countertop ice makers like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker and the VIVOHOME Compact Ice Maker. While the GE Profile delivers chewable nugget ice, it runs at a higher price point and takes longer to produce its first batch of ice. On the flip side, the VIVOHOME is comparable in affordability, but it lacks the intuitive control panel and LED indicators of the Igloo model. In my experience, the Igloo product strikes a nice balance between efficiency, size, and price.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For a midsize household or anyone who hosts gatherings often, investing in a compact ice maker like this is highly practical. The lack of installation, quick ice production, and energy efficiency make it feel like a steal in its segment. Compared to similar devices, this one hits a sweet spot for quality relative to its cost. It feels durable enough without being overly extravagant, which matters if you‚Äôre sticking to a budget.

1k60vfm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k60vfm,Zero Proof Events,"I‚Äôm Birdie üïäÔ∏è I organize zero proof events for Queer + Sober Atlanta since 2018. When I relapsed after 1.5 years of recovery, I noticed a significant gap in safe, social spaces for LGBTQIA+ people.

In those early days there weren‚Äôt many non-alcoholic alternatives and even fewer options in the entertainment industry and nightlife. Now there are sober bars and entire bottle shops that sell zero proof products, and the recipes have drastically improved.

Today I‚Äôd like to share the type of events I produce to inspire those who struggle to be social without alcohol. You are not alone, and there are so many ways to connect with likeminded people safely and creatively ~

1. Monthly coffee shop meetups
2. Vegan potluck picnics at the park
3. Road trip to an animal sanctuary
4. Art shows with musical guests
5. Dance parties at queer clubs
6. Garden parties at a local farm
7. Vision board parties
8. Rooftop kava parties
9. Full moon markets
10. Virtual meetups

Over the last seven years I‚Äôve developed relationships with alcohol-free brands and venues which allow me to host free events for my community with complimentary beverage offerings. We work with a vegan food pop-up and local vendors who sell their products, and our guests have more flexibility to shop since we do not charge for admission or drinks.

People often ask why I do this work without fiscal profit. I‚Äôm just creating spaces I want to experience that don‚Äôt already exist. I‚Äôm trying to build a world where addiction treatment is not stigmatized, accountability is more normalized, and everyone everywhere can connect with people, places, and products that significantly reduce harm and cultivate joy.

There is a harmonious intersection of queers who don‚Äôt drink alcohol, don‚Äôt eat meat, and practice astrology & tarot, so my events are typically from that lens. I believe that the events you host should be a reflection of YOUR interests specifically to remain authentic as you tap into your audience.

I‚Äôll continue to share the template I built out organically as we explore the opportunities you have from your respective corner of the map.

So, what city are you in? What does your ideal sober event look like?",1,1745419305.0,soberqueers,0,1.0,False

1k60uy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1k60uy1/abrupt_change/,Abrupt Change,"Not 100% sure about the flair, but given the time I had last night it's the closest one.

I had previously posted about my partner not meeting my needs and my trying to hold out until I had enough money to leave. That avenue was changed abruptly yesterday. He gave me thirty days to get packed and out of the house. I'm writing this from a friend's house right now because I was too distraught to go back to his house last night after work.

The short story is that the relationship was on its last legs anyway and we were actually discussing the possibility of couples therapy. There was a LOT going on that I was willing to work on, but he never found the time for us to make an appointment together (his typical M.O. for unpleasant tasks) so we never started.

The details: his horrible kid had been told the time we need to leave for school each morning to ensure he got there with enough time to walk to his first class on time. This reason was explained to the teenager multiple times. 

Every day for the last three weeks, this kid walked out the door 3-8 minutes after the time he was supposed to be in the car. I mentioned it to my ex and asked him to address it (by this time I was only a chauffeur and food source). He said he would, but never did. Always an excuse--it's been a weird week, we were having a great day and I forgot--but I never said anything. 

Yesterday (Tuesday), the teen walks out of the house late again. When he gets in the car, he says ""I forgot my earbuds. Can I go back and get them?"" To which I calmly answered, ""no, you're already late.""

He flipped out, went on about how I was ""freaking out"" over 4 minutes. I never raised my voice at him. Simply stated that he needs to make sure he has everything ready the night before as previously discussed MANY times. He sends a text to his dad, saying I was the one freaking out, and then tells me he is never listening to me again. Cool. I told him he could find another ride to school starting today.

I got a huge nasty text rant from the ex, defending the teen's behavior yet again, and telling me that not allowing his earbuds was the same as not allowing his meds because he missed a dose. Nope. He's not allowed to have them at school anyway and has been told as such by several teachers.

So I was given 30 days to find a place and move. Because I said no and made his horrible teenager face the consequences of his actions.

On the plus side, I no longer have to worry about my needs being neglected. But now I have to rehome my cats because my best option is to move into a room at work and I can't have them there. A coworker has agreed to take them in, so I'll be able to come visit them, but I'm gonna miss having my girl sleep on my hip.

I still don't have the money needed to move properly, so I have to use my car and move my stuff to my storage units. Anything sentimental is going first to prevent him from intentionally damaging things. 

And yes, I'm getting petty and taking anything that I bought that hasn't gone missing or been destroyed. Including the laundry pods and most of the towels (which have been a huge point of contention).

His kid destroyed my office chair, most of the coffee cups I bought for the house, a $200 mattress I had purchased but was in storage at the time, and the rocker recliner that had belonged to my grandmother. And there were excuses for every one of those instances. I said things enough that this shouldn't have happened, yet I was told I was nagging when no one would listen.

I will get through this.

\*\*\*

Captain Michael Fay Liurre sat ponderously in the captain‚Äôs chair, staring thoughtfully out of the view screen, thinking with his best frowny face.

*‚ÄúCaptains Log: Stardate‚Ä¶Tuesday.‚Äù* *‚ÄúSpace Ship 1 has completed its refit and is currently en route to the Milariun system, where we are to host a diplomatic gathering, hoping to secure lasting peace in the Milariun conflict.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúMorale is high, pillows are fluffed and the coffee machine is‚Ä¶‚Äù*

&nbsp;  

He paused to sip from a steaming mug, then nodded.

*‚ÄúMmm. Functional. However, the crew appears to be afflicted by an unusual ailment.‚Äù*

&nbsp;  

A crewman behind him sneezes. He doesn‚Äôt turn around.

‚ÄúThere it is again. What *is* that?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúA sneeze, captain.‚Äù Science Officer Jim stated.

‚ÄúYes, I know - but what‚Äôs causing it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIrritation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat,‚Äù Jim replied.

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre pinched his nose.

‚ÄúWell what‚Äôs causing *that*? A virus? Bacteria? Sexy alien fox girls with allergies?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs‚Ä¶dust, captain.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúDust?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúWhy do you keep repeating-‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚Äú-Damn. Is it at least‚Ä¶*Space* dust?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Jim tilted his head thoughtfully.

‚ÄúWell, yes and no, technically-‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúDammit Jim, I need to know what we‚Äôre dealing with! Lives are at stake!‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúThen yes sir, *space* dust.""

‚ÄúAstonishing. Every day a new discovery.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Jim glanced at a confused crewman and shook his head.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúExcellent work. But we can‚Äôt be sneezing our way through these negotiations, can we?‚Äù

Captain Liurre smiled knowingly.¬†

‚ÄúRight. Options?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúSir?‚Äù The young ensign at the helm turned around.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúOh! Yes, ensign?‚Äù

‚Äú...sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on ensign, speak up - I know you‚Äôre new, but you may speak freely. What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúEnsign Options, Sir.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre blinked.

‚ÄúAh. No. I need *options*.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Lieutenant Noh leaned in.¬†

‚ÄúEnsign Options is right there, sir. Are you okay?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre turned to the Ensign, and then Lieutenant Noh.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Who crewed this ship? Moving on. Dust! We need‚Ä¶‚Äù

&nbsp;  

He looked at Ensign Options tentatively.

&nbsp;  

‚Äú...ways of dealing with this.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúMight I suggest cleaning, sir?‚Äù Jim interjected

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre nodded.¬†

‚ÄúCleaning. Hmm. Perhaps‚Ä¶vacuuming? That has a certain ring to it. Someone grab a vacuum cleaner.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

The computer chipped in.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid the S-U-M-1 computer system lacks the physical appendages to operate such a device. Might I suggest manual operation - or perhaps venting the affected areas?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre narrowed his eyes.

‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre talking. Let‚Äôs do some‚Ä¶‚Äù

He paused for effect.

‚Äú...vacuuming.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúWhich area is this‚Ä¶space dust‚Ä¶most concentrated in?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶I‚Äôm afraid you won‚Äôt like this.‚Äù Jim grimaced.

‚ÄúI rise to any challenge, Jim. Where is it?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúWell sir, the refit adopted some more‚Ä¶traditional naming conventions sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd? Get to the point.‚Äù

‚Äú...it‚Äôs on the poop deck, sir.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúDear God.‚Äù¬†

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre sprang into action.¬†

‚ÄúEvacuate the poop deck immediately. There‚Äôs‚Ä¶no other choice.‚Äù¬†

&nbsp;  

""Activating brown alert now, captain."" Jim replied.

&nbsp;  

""Crewman. Grab a mop. Jim - *vacuumise* that dust!""

""...vacuum it?""

&nbsp;  

He cursed his slip of the tongue.

&nbsp;  

""No - *vent it*‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Ensign Noh spun around.

""I can't, captain. That‚Äôs Lieutenant Jim‚Äôs-""¬†

&nbsp;  

""-surely someone must be able to?""

&nbsp;  

""I'm afraid the AI SUM-1 can‚Äôt do that, captain. Shall I?"" Jim interjected.

&nbsp;  

""Finally! Yes. Vent that space dust into space.""

""You mean the dust‚Ä¶that‚Äôs inside?""

""Yes, the space dust. Vent it outside.""

""The space dust‚Ä¶is already...outside?""

&nbsp;  

""Damn, that was quick.""

""No - I mean it's always been outside."" Jim replied.

&nbsp;  

Ensign Noh looks on nervously. Captain Liurre shook his head at her.¬†

&nbsp;  

""Well then what's inside?""

""Well sir, you, me, ensign Noh-""

""-ah! What kind of dust is *inside*?""

""Just...dust?""

""Well get it outside, with the rest of the space dust.""

""The outside space dust or the inside space dust?""

""Both, outside, now.""

&nbsp;  

Ensign Noh and Science Officer Jim both stood up, making to leave.

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre held up his hand.

‚ÄúWait. I have a better idea. Let‚Äôs head to engineering - they‚Äôll know what to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too, sir?‚Äù Ensign Noh looked on, hopefully.

&nbsp;  

‚Äú...Yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúSUM-1, find us a route that avoids the‚Ä¶‚Äù

He visibly shuddered.

‚Äú...poop deck.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúAcknowledged captain. Optimal route would be via the renamed and refitted 'Quarterdeck'.""

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúOh, I like the sound of that. Let‚Äôs go there.‚Äù

\*\*\*

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre stared down at the sign, flanked by Ensign Noh and Lieutenant Options.

&nbsp;  

The sign simply said ‚ÄòWelcome to the new and improved Quarterdeck!‚Äô. It was affixed to the wall, two inches from the ceiling, and eight inches from the ground. The entire deck was 16 inches tall.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs idea was this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe engineers wanted to show off their work, sir, I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd mind-‚Äù

‚Äú-No. No! No - Why is the deck 16 inches tall?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúSwimming pool expansion, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm. Can‚Äôt be helped. And we *have* to go through here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid so, sir. It‚Äôs either this or the poop deck.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúAbsolutely not. I won‚Äôt be putting lives at risk unnecessarily. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

They crawled through the perilous depths of the quarterdeck, eventually arriving at Engineering.¬†

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúNow, this is certainly impressive. Who‚Äôs in charge here?‚Äù Captain Liurre asked, loudly.¬†

‚ÄúYou are, sir!‚Äù Lieutenant Options replied, proudly from his side.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúHmm. And who‚Äôs the Engineer in charge of all‚Ä¶this‚Ä¶wonderful‚Ä¶machinery?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat would be me sir - Lieutenant Brian.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBrain?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrian.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúShame - so how does this work then?""

Captain Liurre gestured vaguely to a large glowing, flashing piece of equipment.

&nbsp;  

""No Idea Sir.‚Äù Lieutenant Brian replied.

Ensign Noh leaned around to get a better look.

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre paused for a moment.

‚ÄúMaybe you should sit this one out, ensign.‚Äù

She nodded and stepped back.

&nbsp;  

""Who does know, then?""

""No I mean - *it runs on No Ideas*. A lack of ideas. Steve's inside it right now, trying not to have any ideas. Wave for the captain, Steve.""

&nbsp;  

Steve did wave. Encased in a small glass room with a sign that read: ‚ÄòNull Reaction Chamber. NO BIG IDEAS‚Äô.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúScience will never cease to amaze me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt doubt that, sir.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúAnyway, we‚Äôre here about the dust.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent sir. It‚Äôs always a problem in engineering.‚Äù

‚ÄúHere too?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverywhere, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is more serious than I thought.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre tapped his badge.

‚ÄúBridge. It seems the problem is spreading. Engineering‚Äôs affected as well. Although‚Ä¶‚Äù

He watched Lieutenant Brian suspiciously for a few moments.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúNo signs of any danger‚Ä¶yet.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

He tapped his badge again.

‚ÄúListen, Lieutenant Brian. I need options here.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlready here, captain.‚Äù Lieutenant Options interjected.

‚ÄúNo. No!‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Too late.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Ensign Noh jogged quickly to his side.

‚Äú...What I mean to say is‚Ä¶we need ideas.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt do that here, I‚Äôm afraid. You‚Äôll have to take it elsewhere.‚Äù Lieutenant Brian pointed to the sign.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúCurses. Foiled by bureaucracy once again. Listen here, lieutenant. You‚Äôre supposed to be the brains of this outfit-‚Äù

*‚Äú-Brian.‚Äù*¬†

‚Äú-Yes. Help us solve this problem. Forget your dull existence for a while. Be a hero.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Lieutenant Brian paused.

‚ÄúWell sir, I suppose I could give you‚Ä¶‚Äù

&nbsp;  

A small yellow light blinked on the Null Reaction Chamber.

‚ÄúCareful.‚Äù Steve said, filing his nails.

&nbsp;  

‚Äú...choices.‚Äù Brian finished, smiling conspiratorially.

*‚ÄúOutstanding.‚Äù*

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúThank you sir.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIf we toggle the dampeners briefly while accelerating rapidly, we *may* be able to shake the dust loose and then use the air circulators to clear out all the dust.‚Äù¬†

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúAnd then vent it?‚Äù Captain Liurre suggested, hopefully.

‚ÄúSure, why not.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúFantastic. Ensign Noh, Lieutenant Options?‚Äù

*‚ÄúTo the bridge.‚Äù*

\*\*\*

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre sat with renewed determination, ready to command. The problem - identified. The solution - vaguely outlined. All that remained was the swift, seamless execution to a perfect resolution.¬†

One for the history books.¬†

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúEnsign Noh.‚Äù He stated, loudly and firmly, for the record.

‚ÄúPrepare to engage the warp drive.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Ensign Noh turned.¬†

‚ÄúYou mean the Engage drive, captain?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúNo - the Warp drive. Engage it.‚Äù he bristled, slightly flustered.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶the *Engage drive* is already *warping*, sir?‚Äù She tried, hopefully.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúWhat? How did this happen?! Get it straightened out immediately.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo sir, I mean-‚Äù

‚ÄúEngineering. Somehow the‚Ä¶Engage drive? Is all bent out of shape. Get on it.‚Äù

‚Äú...sir?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúNo sir, the *Engage drive* is currently at *warp speed,* sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, of course. You should‚Äôve been clearer, ensign.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚Äú...yes sir.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Captain Liurre straightened his back.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúWarp the Engage drive. Uh‚Ä¶more‚Ä¶fasterer?‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúStanding by to toggle dampeners sir.‚Äù Science Officer Jim sighed.

‚ÄúDo it on my mark. Wait.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

He looked around.¬†

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúAnybody named Mark?‚Äù

Silence.

Perfect.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúOn my mark, then.‚Äù

He waited for far longer than was necessary to build the suspense.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúMark!‚Äù

The Engage drive‚Ä¶engaged. The ship shook, gently at first, becoming more violent. Everybody swayed back and forth, slightly out of sync with each other.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúToggling dampeners now, sir!‚Äù Jim yelled, dramatically.

&nbsp;  

A small patter of rain drops began falling from above.

He went with it.

&nbsp;  

He turned to Lieutenant Options.

‚ÄúHow is this supposed to work, again?‚Äù he asked, face dripping with water.

‚ÄúNo idea.‚Äù she replied.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúI thought that was the reactor.‚Äù He frowned.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúEngineering. Prepare to engage the process of starting the air circulation‚Ä¶thing.‚Äù He tried, professionally.¬†

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù came the crisp response.¬†

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúThis water is a distraction. Options-‚Äù

‚Äú-Yes?‚Äù

‚Äú-We could‚Äù

‚Äú-How about‚Äù

&nbsp;  

Several people spoke at once over the patter of raindrops, as the bridge shook violently back and forth.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúNo - ‚Äú

‚Äú-Yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo - I mean, can someone-‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚Äú-Yes, captain?‚Äù The computer chirped.

&nbsp;  

The water ran freely down his face.

He looked off into the distance.¬†

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs probably enough.‚Äù he slapped his armchair with finality.

‚ÄúResuming normal dampener function, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúReturning to normal speed, sir.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúDust status?‚Äù He looked to his science officer.

‚ÄúProvided you have absolutely no follow-up questions‚Ä¶nominal, sir.‚Äù Science Officer Jim replied.

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúFantastic work everyone. Jim - tell Lieutenant Brian I‚Äôll be recommending a‚Ä¶recommendation for him? Just don‚Äôt let him get any ideas.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, sir.‚Äù

&nbsp;  

‚ÄúAnother victory for the intrepid crew of Space Ship 1. Well done, gang.‚Äù

I‚Äôm a street photographer visiting Portland for a one-day trip (coming down from Seattle) on Tuesday May 6th, and wanted to ask for some recommendations:

	1.	Neighborhoods or spots I should check out for street photography?
I‚Äôm drawn to gritty textures, candid moments, street art, nightlife‚Äîanything that feels alive and has character. Industrial areas, markets, weird corners‚Äîsend me your favorite spots!

There‚Äôs also a huge mural that graffiti art collective Brokenfingaz painted some years ago; I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs still there. 

	2.	Open to doing quick, impromptu portraits!

If anyone local is interested in getting a casual portrait done (street style, flash, or natural light), I‚Äôd love to connect. Could be a quick shoot out in the street, your favorite coffee shop, whatever. Happy to share the photos after.

I work with a mixture of film and digital. I know Portland has a cool looking camera store called Blue moon camera that I plan to visit. 

Here‚Äôs a list of cameras I plan on bringing:
- Fujifilm GFX 50R
- Mamiya C220
- Sony a6000
- Olympus infinity zoom 105

It seems the norm here is just breakfast tea, coffee or hot chocolate - which won't do for her. Bonus if they have a spa and extra bonus points if they have no victoria sponge.

Somewhere between your laugh and the silence that followed, I fell for you.

Maybe that‚Äôs what love is; not the fire, not the chaos, but the tenderness of finally being met. *Of being known without needing to be explained*.

You are not near me, and still, I carry you; in the moments before sleep, in the quiet after the world has gone still, in the songs I skip straight to the chorus, in the coffee that never quite tastes as good without your name in the morning. I have never touched your skin, and still, I swear, my hands remember you.

Isn‚Äôt that something? To miss what you‚Äôve never had. To ache for someone like they‚Äôve already lived a hundred lifetimes between galaxies. I look at my reflection and see pieces of you in all the places I‚Äôve softened. And yet, I haven‚Äôt traced your fingertips. I haven‚Äôt mapped your smile with mine. But I love you, fully. Without waiting for permission. Without needing proof. Without condition.

People don‚Äôt understand how distance can hold something so sacred. But you and I? We existed beyond logic. Beyond explanation. You were not an idea. You were not a maybe. You are here, still, in the shape of every word I haven‚Äôt written yet, in the pause between my sentences, in the spaces that no longer feel empty.

I love you, still, in a way that has nothing to do with time. Nothing to do with space. Only everything to do with truth. With energy. With gravity. You pulled at something in me I forgot was alive. And I would wait lifetimes for a touch that feels the way your presence always did.

This is not a beginning. This is not an ending. This is a remembering.

He's always written me off and said that I'm being paranoid because they're already ground up and it's no different than washing stuff from a disposal down the drain. Well here we are, ""down the line"" with a clogged kitchen sink. He spent over 45min before work trying to snake (15-25ft snake) and plunge it, and I've spent my work breaks trying to unclog it as well by plugging one side and plunging the other (both sides have standing water). 

I've seen that taking the trap out may help if it's just settled in the trap so we'll try that after work, but if that doesn't work, I'd like to know a ballpark estimate for how much we'd be looking at spending to get a professional out to fix it. 

I'm also hoping someone may have some advice for what else we can try before calling someone.

**Chapter V**

**Sorrow for the Lost**

Astral got out of the car‚Äôs passenger side and followed Detective Sait≈ç to the fifth floor of a very popular and very high end hotel. Astral was very certain this was the kind of place that had those really expensive mints they put on pillows, but he resisted asking as he walked by the people at the front desk.  

‚ÄúSo, what have you uncovered in your research?‚Äù Sait≈ç asked as he rolled his neck on the elevator ride up.

‚ÄúWell, everything I‚Äôve read combined with information from my very reliable sources, tells me we have a Revenant of some sort on our hand.‚Äù Astral fumbled in his pockets until he pulled out a handful of small wrapped up bubble gum pieces, he smiled as he unwrapped a few and put them in his mouth.

‚ÄúRevenant?‚Äù Sait≈ç, ‚ÄúSounds like a ghost.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMaybe in a cheap horror story or comic.‚Äù Astral began to explain, ‚ÄúBasically, take a dead guy and a god or even something like a kami. Kami gives the dead guy a purpose, brings them back to life and it‚Äôs up to the now formerly dead guy to either complete the goal or try to better themselves according to a curse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Sait≈ç nodded, ‚ÄúSo what makes one of these your primary suspect?‚Äù 

‚ÄúCurrently there are very few things that can just blast an angel and end its existence, a Fallen doubly so. Normally you kill one and they just go back to Paradise. Fallen Angels don‚Äôt get that so they make themselves harder to kill, is my understanding at least.‚Äù Astral stepped out of the elevator and followed Sait≈ç to a corner room where holographic police tape cordoned off the room.

‚ÄúTake a look around, see if you spot anything we missed or didn‚Äôt have a chance to see.‚Äù Sait≈ç opened the door and turned off the holograms.

Astral walked in and saw in person what no pictures could have conveyed. On the wall further down to the living room was a great white and gold stain on the wall. He walked over to it and stared, then slowly peeled himself away as his eyes traced from the hole in the wall where the ammunition had lodged itself and went through a now clearly replaced window and frame.

‚ÄúReplaced the window.‚Äù Astral observed as he pulled out a marker and some string. ‚ÄúAm I good to do something a little weird?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt let the weather contaminate the scene, the frame was replaced along with it and we have it all at the precinct. And I‚Äôd call that more old school. Go ahead.‚Äù Sait≈ç smirked.

Astral pulled out a small wheel of tape and tapped one end of the string to the wall at about the same spot as the hole with a pencil gently setting in the hole, pointing at the angle of entry. Then he walked over to the window and held it taught and tried to match the angle of which the bullet had lodged itself into the wall. Once had got it he noticed that the angle was almost impossible to have been made.

‚ÄúSee what I mean.‚Äù Sait≈ç chuckled, ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs getting that close at that angle.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one without powers, at least.‚Äù Astral said as he slid the window open, stepped out and unfurled his wings. 

The great black and glowing wings held him for a moment before he flew out a few feet and turned back to coast along the top of the window frames. He spotted what he needed immediately, white stains with black chemical burns charred into the outer stone of the hotel. He took a few photos with his camera before flying off to check other nearby buildings and found several similar burn marks. Then he stepped back into the window and showed his photos to Sait≈ç as he closed his wings.

‚ÄúWhat are these?‚Äù The detective asked.

‚ÄúMy guess is that if you have them analyzed you‚Äôll see they‚Äôre magnesium flares or something similar. A bright but quick burning fuel source. Either used as a light source, or marker, or even something we have no clue about.‚Äù Astral explained, ‚ÄúBut they wouldn‚Äôt last more than a week.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get our techs out to get samples.‚Äù Sait≈ç nodded. ‚ÄúThis is a new lead and definitely in my ballpark.‚Äù The older man grinned. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it all going with your former employer?‚Äù

‚ÄúHopefully, solved after today.‚Äù Astral smirked, ‚ÄúLawyer wrote up a mean agreement. Also, something the picture couldn‚Äôt pick up well enough, there‚Äôs groove marks in the stones near those marks, all relatively identical. Someone was grappling about.‚Äù 

Sait≈ç nodded, ‚ÄúMakes sense. We‚Äôre still trying to figure out how no one heard anything but the initial gunshot.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo sound outside.‚Äù Astral thought for a moment. ‚ÄúMay not be something we can answer at this time.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù Sait≈ç sighed, ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs go check out your cat lady. Believe it or not you progressed us from a dead stop.‚Äù 

Astral smiled, ‚ÄúYeah, let‚Äôs check out Madame Neko.‚Äù 

Sait≈ç rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúShe hates me, but okay.‚Äù 

The two laughed as they rode the elevator down and shared a few jokes. As they walked out the door Astral looked over towards a large alleyway between a set of fancy shops and he froze as his senses told him something angry was lurking in the darkness.

Sait≈ç watched his angelic companion and paused, reaching for his radio very slowly.

‚ÄúClear the area.‚Äù Astral spread his wings once more and lunged towards the alleyway. 

He was met halfway as a large green form like a cross between a sewer gator and a kappa slammed into him. He heard voices shriek ‚ÄúTerrotorga‚Äù as the people ran and Sait≈ç began to call for people to evacuate.

Astral quickly found himself pushing back against a form that easily out sized and outclassed him in all the most important factors one needed in a fight. Its strength was monstrous, without a doubt and every time Astral would pull back and slam a fist into its bulbous form, it just laughed. Astral could only keep out of its clutches as he sprang about it doing little to no damage as he did so. Then he made his first mistake and looked over to see how Sait≈ç was doing, the creature just barely grazed him with its massive claws, but it was enough to send Astral spiraling to the ground and he slammed into a car‚Äôs hood and rolled over to see the beast approaching as he tried to to force himself up. The beast was only a few steps from him when Astral heard the whistling he normally dreaded and a second later five colorful explosions erupted in front of him as the Sentai Saviors arrived.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here now!‚Äù Sentai Savior Red shouted as he glanced back and paused, ‚ÄúAstral get back, Tech‚Äôs on his way!‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt did that to Astral?‚Äù Sentai Savior Green growled, ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm really mad!‚Äù The Sentai fighter ran forward and a flurry of blows later was tossed into another car, but sprang back up with little care.

Astral wasn‚Äôt able to see the rest after that as he was holding his arm to his chest, the creature had damaged it and likely broken it with its attack and the resulting slam. He limped over to Sait≈ç‚Äôs car where the officer had pulled out a shotgun from his trunk‚Äôs weapon locker. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother.‚Äù Astral grunted.

‚ÄúHow are they taking those hits and you‚Äôre like this?‚Äù Sait≈ç blinked.

‚ÄúMed-tech in their suits temporarily relieves the pain. Great for the middle of the fight damage, but they get hit with it all a few hours later.‚Äù Astral grunted. ‚ÄúBut I can fix my arm...‚Äù He focused his thoughts on the arm and spoke a word of Babel meant to heal and repair. Soon the pain in his arm faded, but the pain from the claw that dragged across his chest remained.

‚ÄúI got the rest!‚Äù The small frame of Tech Tanuki raced up and jammed a comically thick syringe into Astral‚Äôs leg. 

‚ÄúYou damn well better be glad I know how that works.‚Äù Astral grumbled as he felt the pain fade away, soon the damage vanished as well. ‚ÄúNow can one of you tell me who tubbo here is? ‚Äú

‚ÄúTerrotorga.‚Äù Tech explained as he loaded his rifle with a series of tranquilizers. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a kappa that got captured and experimented on. Mutagenics and the like.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBlackwood?‚Äù Sait≈ç asked.

‚ÄúNot his speed.‚Äù Tech shook his head, ‚ÄúStill don‚Äôt know who this psycho-doctor is, but I‚Äôve been working on a cure for Torga.‚Äù He held up a very thick syringe with a blue liquid in it. ‚ÄúWe get him to sit still and I can apply it.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Astral cracked his neck, ‚ÄúBeat the victim senseless to save his life. This world seriously sucks sometimes.‚Äù 

Sait≈ç nodded with a grim smile.

‚ÄúSait≈ç, channel 44.5 will get you into their coms, tell the Saviors to follow Tech‚Äôs direction here. I‚Äôll get the big boy to hold still.‚Äù Astral chuckled.

Astral stood up and took to the sky, he flew up about thirty meters and coasted over the large mutant before rocketing back down with his right leg extended for a strike. As he crossed the face of the beast a sonic boom crashed through the creature and the area, car windows shattered as did the front windows of the hotel and the businesses nearby. The creature stood in shocked silence as a large welt by its eye was now clearly visible.

‚ÄúPaying attention to me now, Torga?‚Äù Astral growled.

TerroTroga roared and reared up to slap the nephilim down, but Astral uttered only a single word and the beast locked up as golden chains of light sprang up and restrained the thrashing form. The Sentai Saviors all rushed in and held a different chain down to ensure the beast couldn‚Äôt move. Then Tech came in and jabbed the syringe right by the same injury Astral had delivered to it. Then it trashed even more and began to pull up the chains.

‚ÄúHUNGER!‚Äù TerroTorga roared.

Astral was shocked as he watched the creature‚Äôs power surge and wane, but then he thought of the perfect solution. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs all in your head, Torga. You‚Äôre full, you‚Äôre _sated_.‚Äù Astral felt the power of Babel pulse through him as he tried to calm the mutated yokai‚Äôs mind. 

Torga stopped thrashing and his form slowly began to shrink. Astral held a calm hand to the yokai‚Äôs head as he shrunk down. When he was just barely human size Astral noted that he looked emaciated and went to call for medics.

‚ÄúThank you. Angels been so nice to Torga.‚Äù The yokai smiled weakly. ‚ÄúLast one fed me so I wouldn‚Äôt hurt. But he‚Äôs gone.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù Astral asked.

‚ÄúGood things do not last long in this world.‚Äù Torga sighed and closed his eyes as Tech raced over with several emergency workers.

Sait≈ç walked up to Astral and held out a phone. Astral recognized it as his own and looked it over. The screen was scratched and it had clearly hit something hard, but it still worked and there was an active call from Ukiko‚Äôs number.  He looked at Sait≈ç like a deer caught in headlights.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs, ah, mighty angry.‚Äù Sait≈ç smiled as he passed the phone to Astral.

‚ÄúH-hey...‚Äù Astral stammered as a panicked and worried Ukiko shrieked over the line.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

Astral stepped out of Sait≈ç‚Äôs car and walked up the pathway to his home, now for the first time realizing how much of a pain it was to get more than one car into the home‚Äôs driveway, and how peculiar it was compared to its neighbors. Still he had more important things to concern himself with and as he walked past Ukiko‚Äôs car he felt a small body slam into his legs, then Ukiko stood up from sitting on the stairs and carefully approached. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm alive.‚Äù Astral said, ‚ÄúStill in one piece, though I would like my legs back.‚Äù 

Ariane relinquished his legs and looked up with a smile. ‚ÄúYou helped someone.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI did.‚Äù Astral nodded, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs getting help from others now.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou fought a giant mutant kappa.‚Äù Ukiko said with just an edge of exhaustion.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Astral nodded. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm investigating the death of a fallen angel.‚Äù 

Ukiko nodded, ‚ÄúYou make a fair point. But don‚Äôt worry us like that! Your phone died just as soon as I got to hear your voice again!‚Äù 

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt worried.‚Äù Ariane smirked.

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Astral smiled down at her. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs what happens when a multi-ton mutant uses me like a punching bag. I should get a better phone case.‚Äù 

Ukiko rolled her eyes and stormed back to the door. ‚ÄúDinner‚Äôs waiting!‚Äù She shouted as she closed the door behind her.

‚ÄúWhat we got?‚Äù Astral looked at Ariane.

‚ÄúFish and rice with scrambled eggs on the side.‚Äù Ariane said with a smile, ‚ÄúI got to make the eggs.‚Äù She ran back inside.

Astral looked up to the sky and smiled, then walked inside and took off his shoes in the house‚Äôs genkan, the entryway where shoes were taken off. He smiled again as he saw Ariane‚Äôs and Ukiko‚Äôs shoes next to his and made his way to the kitchen and dining room just beyond it. He sat in his usual chair and Ariane hopped into hers as Ukiko passed a soda to each of them and sat down herself.

‚ÄúSour raspberry?‚Äù Astral blinked.

‚ÄúYou like sour things.‚Äù Ukiko shrugged, ‚ÄúI got a six pack of that and the one for Ariane and myself.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI have to share.‚Äù Ariane pretended to pout. 

‚ÄúYou can have some of mine too.‚Äù Astral offered.

‚ÄúYay!‚Äù Ariane laughed.

‚ÄúSo...‚Äù Ukiko smiled, ‚Äú... You were right.‚Äù

‚ÄúBacked off?‚Äù Astral nodded, ‚ÄúLawyers for the church only care about two things, winning and money and not necessarily in that order.‚Äù 

Ukiko nodded, ‚ÄúAlexy Yuri was there too.‚Äù 

Astral snapped his head up in concern.

‚ÄúHe said that the carrot has been exhausted.‚Äù Ukiko reiterated the phrase with a disgusted roll of her eyes.

Astral went to stand but paused and looked at the table. Then he smiled and turned back to his family. ‚ÄúWell he can threaten all he likes. Right now I‚Äôm here. With the people I care for.‚Äù 

Ariane smiled and put a large piece of fish in her mouth. ‚ÄúWe love you too!‚Äù 

Astral tousled her hair, then raised his can as a toast to Ukiko, ‚ÄúTo the best lawyer in this family.‚Äù 

Ukiko blushed slightly and raised her can. ‚ÄúKampai.‚Äù 

‚ÄúKampai!‚Äù Ariane raised her can too.

They ate in a joyful silence until the meal was over and Craig knocked on the door.  

‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù Ukiko said cheerfully.

‚ÄúI bought a game at the store today. A classic!‚Äù Craig cascaded a board game up from his home to his front legs. ‚ÄúWho wants to play Monopoly?!‚Äù 

‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù Astral shook his head, ‚ÄúYou kill friendships with that game.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like that it teaches money is everything.‚Äù Ukiko agreed with Astral. ‚ÄúHow about Life?‚Äù 

Craig sighed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good at Monopoly though.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou can be good at Life too.‚Äù Ariane said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fun, you can get married, have a dog, make a ton of money. You can win with money, Craig.‚Äù

Craig tapped his mandibles and the game cascaded back down his legs, ‚ÄúSold.‚Äù 

‚ÄúLet me clean up and I‚Äôll get it.‚Äù Ukiko said.

‚ÄúI got the plates!‚Äù Ariane smiled and grabbed the plates from the table and rushed them to the sink.

Astral smiled as he waited for Ukiko to get the game. He had a plan to win with all the retirement points he could get.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

The next morning Astral woke up early and made a quick breakfast and cup of coffee. He put on his coat and headed out with a flat expression of grim determination. Craig was outside and went to greet him but paused as he saw the Nephilim‚Äôs face, then he skittered back under the home.

Astral made his way to St. Mary‚Äôs Cathedral, the largest Catholic Church in Tokyo. It was rebuilt after Tokyo‚Äôs destruction during the Purge War. It‚Äôs design was unchanged but the floor was made with bricks and rubble from the city as a reminder of those lost. He stepped in quietly and made his way to the cross, but paused as he caught sight of a priest with a scar on his right cheek. He glared as he knew who this man had to be and had to restrain himself as the man looked at him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre him.‚Äù The priest, Father Farren, gasped. ‚ÄúOf course you‚Äôre him. Alexy has been boasting since yesterday. Let me take his place. Thrash me instead. I‚Äôve earned it with my history.‚Äù 

Astral took a step back and leaned on a pew, shocked by the priest‚Äôs offer.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve made many choices and declarations in what I thought was a show of faith.‚Äù Father Farren shook his head, ‚ÄúBut I was wrong. Let me take what he should receive.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not yours.‚Äù Astral shook his head and pointed at him. ‚ÄúYou are repentant. Yuri delights in the violence. I know, we‚Äôre birds of a feather in that way.‚Äù 

Father Farren was silent and nodded, but looked up. ‚ÄúTell me the woman and girl are safe, at least.‚Äù 

Astral nodded and then stood up as he saw the slender frame of Alexy Yuri enter. The priest seemed to sway as he walked over to the pews.

‚ÄúFarren, I see you‚Äôve finally met Mr. Freiheight.‚Äù Alexy grinned. ‚ÄúShall we set a date for your flagellation?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe can set a date for me stomping your teeth in. Lord knows I won‚Äôt do it in his home and neither will you.‚Äù Astral snapped.

‚ÄúWell, at least you‚Äôre civil about it. I‚Äôm free later today, how about you?‚Äù Alexy laughed.

‚ÄúAlexy, no. This is wrong. He-‚Äù Father Farren was cut off by a glare from Alexy.

‚ÄúNeat, so am I. There‚Äôs an old carnival site north of Tokyo.‚Äù Astral nodded, ‚ÄúBunch of old whale spinny rides.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI know the one.‚Äù Alexy nodded, ‚ÄúThree o‚Äôclock?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be waiting with bells on.‚Äù Astral pushed off from the pew and made his way to the door. 

As he exited he wanted to shout in rage, but he caught sight of a robe following him. He turned to see Father Farren behind him, a good three inches taller and staring down at him in desperation. 

‚ÄúCan you forgive a man for his errors and tresspasses?‚Äù Father Farren asked, tears welled in his eyes. ‚ÄúI worked to oppress you and your kin of the Father‚Äôs messengers. Can you forgive me?‚Äù 

Astral felt a spike of anger in his heart at the thought and then a soothing grace, but he knew his answer was not what the priest would want to hear. ‚ÄúPray to God, give him your confession. When he answers, so will I.‚Äù 

Father Farren watched as the nephilim spread his wings and flew off to the north. He knew the angel was going to prepare for a fight and he too knew where it was to be held.

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

Astral arrived early and went to work training for a few hours before sitting down and resting. His coat was hanging on a broken metal pipe as he sat and focused. He had never had a need for meditation, though he had trained in it, it never meant anything to him to focus when rage let him do that anyway. Now that he knew his raw anger was a deterrent to his powers and his heritage he found the lessons to be useful. 

‚ÄúPLEASE!‚Äù Father Farren‚Äôs voice rang out.

Astral looked up to see Alexy approaching. Father Farren was at his heels begging for the man to stop his course of action. The younger priest merely shook his head in disgust. Father Farrne then walked slowly to Astral. 

‚ÄúSpare him, please. He can be made to see.‚Äù Father Farren begged. ‚ÄúThis insanity has spilled enough blood.‚Äù 

Astral paused and for a moment almost reconsidered his response to Farren, but he focused on the man‚Äôs request. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt kill him. Never intended that, but he will need a body cast.‚Äù 

Father Farren let out a forlorn cry and sat on a half broken table, determined to watch the madness he was witnessing to the end.

Astral stepped forward in his simple blue shirt and black jeans. He watched as Alexy took off his own overcoat followed by his robes. What followed next actually worried Astral as Alexy removed his collar and shirt to reveal a muscular and toned athletic frame that reminded Astral of the very old Bruce Lee films.

‚ÄúAre you like water, my friend?‚Äù Alexy laughed, showing that he had caught Astral‚Äôs concerned look and took a stance for Shaolin Kung-Fu.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll rock you like a hurricane.‚Äù Astral growled as he threw down a mantis stance and watched Alexy‚Äôs confused face. ‚ÄúShoulda read the dossier!‚Äù

Astral raced forward and slammed a series of strikes into the priest‚Äôs chest. Alexy took the blows and made a few shuddered steps backwards as a field of energy pulsed from his body. Astral felt the majority of his power sap away and much to Alexy‚Äô clear shock Astral grinned and resumed the assault only to be driven back by a counter assault and thrown into a pole. Astral shook his head and watched as Alexy took the offensive and rushed in for a powerful blow to Astral‚Äôs head. Astral dropped all his pretense towards stances and reverted to his classic and unique street fighting style as he tripped the rushing priest and brought up a haymaker into the man‚Äôs chest. The priest coughed a spot of blood and dashed away quickly.

Alexy then stood and grinned as he began his assault once again. This time the man‚Äôs speed caught Astral off guard for a split second and he began to drive Astral into several old arcade machines where he slammed Astral‚Äôs head into the plexiglass shield of a claw machine. Astral grunted and tried to spin out of the assault but the priest refused to let the nephilim have a chance. So Astral had to make his own and uttered a word of Babel. 

Alexy went sailing back several feet and was in complete shock as he watched Astral speak another word and his hands became wreathed in golden flames. Once again Astral stood, but he did not take a stance, and merely stared his enemy down. Alexy roared in anger and reactivated his anti-power field and watched as it did nothing to smother the flames on Astral‚Äôs fists.

Astral began the assault again and the two traded blows as almost equals for a minute before Alexy once again established that he was the better fighter. He once again began to drive Astral back towards the heavy plexiglass shield of a claw machine. Astral was trying to find a way out of the situation when he saw a black streak run up and grab Alexy‚Äôs fists. Father Farren was no longer willing to let the fight go on, but his super strength had been nullified and a very angry Alexy cracked his fist into the other priest‚Äôs jaw. Father Farren stumbled back in shock and pain.

Astral felt a fury in his heart and a single word came to mind. ‚ÄúBlasphemy.‚Äù It rolled off his tongue as an accusation and in a flash of what he assumed was madness he saw a man who was dragging a cross, pointing at Alexy.

Alexy, for his part, only seemed confused and then paused as he looked at his hands. Then he began to scream and dropped to the ground where he began to writhe in pain. Father Farren approached the younger priest and tried to help him but Alexy‚Äôs thrashing pushed him away.

Astral watched as Alexy screamed, then he looked at Farren and sighed. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt offer complete forgiveness. You‚Äôve got too many others you need to ask first, but you‚Äôre trying and that ain‚Äôt nothing.‚Äù 

Farren looked up at Astral and back to Alexy.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening, you might have a better guess than me.‚Äù Astral said, ‚ÄúBut he has reaped what he has sown.‚Äù 

Astral turned and walked away only barely catching Farren caressing the wound upon his cheek where the Hebrew number three was burned into Farren‚Äôs flesh. He grabbed his coat and spread his wings as he flew home.

1k60ec5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1k60ec5/pastries_in_paris_vs_pastries_in_lisbon/,"""Pastries In Paris Vs. Pastries In¬†Lisbon""","I found myself pinned between the soft, flaky highs of culinary warfare, caught in a high-stakes sugar-coated standoff between Paris and Lisbon. Two cities, two cultures, and enough butter to grease a Viking ship. Somewhere along the way I‚Äôd convinced myself that I was the chosen one, the pastry messiah tasked with finding the truth buried beneath layers of laminated dough and custard. And I accepted this noble mission the way any deranged food tourist would with wild-eyed enthusiasm and an unhealthy disregard for cholesterol levels.

Paris. The land where pastry isn‚Äôt just food, it‚Äôs foreplay. You don‚Äôt merely eat a croissant there. You romance it. You whisper sweet nothings to it. You flirt with its golden, buttery curves before devouring it in a flurry of flakes and regret. Every bakery window is an altar to pastry perfection. Rows of mille-feuille standing like puffed-up guards of an empire built on cream and superiority complexes. Eclairs filled with chocolate so rich it probably owns a yacht and votes in foreign elections. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the tarte au citron. Lemon tart they call it, but it‚Äôs more like a citrus death trap, sour enough to slap your taste buds and delicate enough to make you question your self-worth.

But the French don‚Äôt just bake. They pronounce. They cast spells with vowels and pastry terms no one outside of culinary school can decipher. Viennoiserie. P√¢te feuillet√©e. Chouquette. You‚Äôre not just eating a bun, you‚Äôre auditioning for a role in a performance art piece about butter‚Äôs evolution. Each bite comes with judgment. Is your bite angle right? Did you flake in the appropriate direction? Are you holding the pain au chocolat with enough nonchalance to appear Parisian without threatening their pastry hierarchy?

Then, drunk on espresso and existential pastry fatigue, I staggered south to Lisbon. Lisbon is not here to impress you with culinary academia. Lisbon is here to feed you custard until your arteries form a union and demand hazard pay. The Portuguese pastry game is a trap. A sweet, eggy, vanilla-scented trap baked inside a deceptively innocent golden shell. The pastel de nata is the queen here. And she doesn‚Äôt care about your feelings. She wants you to burn the roof of your mouth on her lava-hot center and come crawling back for more like the weak-willed sugar goblin you are.

In Lisbon pastries are everywhere. Not displayed with the haughty pride of a Michelin-starred gallery, but sprawled across caf√© counters like golden ammunition. You want six? You take six. They don‚Äôt ask questions. They hand you a sack of cream-filled crime and send you out into the tiled streets to commit gustatory sins in the name of Portugal. And those natas are never alone. There‚Äôs always something else lurking nearby. A queue de cr√®me, a bolo de arroz, a suspiciously innocent sponge cake that turns out to be filled with some mystery liquor that melts your frontal lobe.

Where Paris flirts with its pastries like a coy mistress, Lisbon shoves them into your hands like an overzealous grandmother. You‚Äôll walk into a caf√© for a coffee and emerge forty minutes later with powdered sugar up your nostrils, three empty plates, and a deep sense of shame paired with light citrus notes.

Here‚Äôs the thing. The Portuguese don‚Äôt need to explain their pastries. There are no condescending lectures about flour provenance or butter temperature. There‚Äôs just a collective national understanding that life is better with custard, and if you don‚Äôt get it, that‚Äôs your problem. It‚Äôs not about presentation. It‚Äôs about pleasure. It‚Äôs about the way the tart cracks beneath your fork like tectonic sugar plates. The way the filling clings to your spoon like a cloying ex you‚Äôre not quite ready to forget.

In any sane world, this wouldn‚Äôt be a competition. Comparing Paris and Lisbon pastries is like comparing silk sheets and electric blankets. They both get the job done but in profoundly different ways. Yet here I was, two weeks deep in pastry-fueled madness, standing in front of a mirror covered in crumbs and jam smears, asking myself the question no man should ever have to answer: Where are the best pastries in the world?

The answer, of course, is both. You need the precision of Paris and the passion of Lisbon. You need the art and the anarchy. The croissant‚Äôs quiet sophistication and the pastel de nata‚Äôs blistering sugar hit. You need the structure of the Eiffel Tower and the chaos of a Portuguese tram packed with confectionary.

But if you forced me to choose? If you backed me into a corner, held a rolling pin to my head, and demanded allegiance? I‚Äôd lean ever so slightly toward Lisbon. Not because it‚Äôs better, but because it‚Äôs unpretentious. Because it doesn‚Äôt make you feel like you‚Äôre on a pastry probationary period. It feeds you, fills you, and pats you on the back while you‚Äôre wheezing from your third nata in ten minutes. Still, I‚Äôd never say that out loud in Paris. I like my mouth unbloodied and my croissants unspat.

Firstly, the weather is so nice in Seattle. I know the rain and cold can get old sometimes when you live here, but Denver is so desperately dry sometimes that the ocean breeze was soul-quenching.

Your downtown area is the best in the nation, at least out of the (many) big cities I've been to. There is no shortage of things to do, and they are so easy to get to, although it is a literal uphill battle that nobody warned me about lol. But that also means that the architecture and layout of almost every building on the hillside is like an adult jungle gym to explore. Seattle BeerCo. was my fav example of this.

The nicest people on planet earth live here. Second to none. There was not a single person I interacted with who was unfriendly or unfunny. My friends and I walked all the way from Queen Anne to Smith Tower one day, and nowhere along the way did I feel unsafe or even sketched out. I took an Argosy harbor tour and one of the crane operators waved to our boat with the clamps of his grabber. Not sure if they pay them to do that but it made me feel like a Disney princess.

I'm a CisHet guy, but the city seemed so LGBT+ friendly and that's so awesome. I hope every city, (especially Denver) follows your example.

The coffee and seafood were even better than they were made out to be. Freya's by pike place was my favorite coffe spot, and shoutout sushi kashiba and la fontana siciliana for the sushi and lobster ravioli, respectively.

Thanks for reading my embarrassing love letter to your town. You have a lot to be proud of.",365,1745418063.0,Seattle,81,0.91,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best storage ottomans with trays in 2025 boast a combination of durable construction, smart design, and user-friendly features.

**Durable Construction:** The frame is typically constructed from solid wood or engineered wood, ensuring stability and longevity. High-quality materials, like hardwood or reinforced composites, withstand daily use and maintain structural integrity over time. The ottoman's base is designed to support a significant amount of weight, accommodating both seating and storage demands.

The upholstery is usually made from durable fabrics such as linen, faux leather, or microfiber. These materials are selected for their resistance to wear and tear, ease of cleaning, and aesthetic appeal. Reinforced stitching and careful detailing contribute to the overall durability of the ottoman.

**Ample Storage Space:** The interior storage compartment offers a generous amount of space for blankets, pillows, books, toys, or other household items. Capacities vary depending on the size of the ottoman, ranging from a few cubic feet to larger compartments that can hold substantial amounts of clutter. Internal dividers or shelving may be included in some models for enhanced organization.

The storage area is easily accessible via a hinged lid that lifts smoothly and securely. Gas struts or other mechanisms may be incorporated to prevent the lid from slamming shut, ensuring safety and convenience.

**Reversible Tray Top:** The defining feature of this type of ottoman is its reversible lid, with one side featuring a flat, upholstered surface for seating or resting feet and the other side providing a solid tray. The tray is typically made from wood, laminate, or a similar durable material, offering a stable surface for drinks, snacks, or laptops.

The tray surface often includes raised edges or a lip to prevent items from sliding off. Some models may feature removable trays for easier cleaning or separate usage. The tray is designed to be easily flipped over, seamlessly transitioning between seating and table functions.

**Enhanced Comfort:** The upholstered top provides a comfortable seating surface, with padding or cushioning for added support. High-density foam or other quality filling materials ensure that the ottoman remains comfortable even during extended use.

The ottoman's height is typically designed to complement sofas and chairs, allowing it to serve as a comfortable footrest. The dimensions are carefully considered to provide ample seating space without overwhelming the room.

**Stylish Design Options:** Storage ottomans with trays are available in a wide variety of styles, colors, and finishes to match different dËåÖcor preferences. Options range from classic and traditional designs to modern and contemporary styles.

1k60doy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k60doy,AIO for asking my husband to drive just once? (He threw food in a fit of rage),"Last night, after I had lightheartedly told my husband to switch seats with me after work, he became upset, saying that he didn‚Äôt want to drive after working all day. Okay, that‚Äôs fair. I completely understood this. I‚Äôve BEEN understanding of this.

* I drive us everywhere by the way; even during my pregnancy and after. He only drove when I had to go deliver.

However, I was making a joke about how I felt embarrassed that the Mcdonald‚Äôs workers pretty much knew who I was since my husband gets food from there nearly every day after work, which was why I had suggested that we switch seats‚Äî/just/ for the 5-6 minute drive to Mcdonald‚Äôs.

He didn‚Äôt like that and started going off about how I was controlling him and that I didn‚Äôt make the rules, and how I sit on my ass all day (I care for my son but if that means I sit on my ass all, alright).

He made it clear that I don‚Äôt contribute to anything financially and therefore I shouldn‚Äôt have a say on much. This was a financial arrangement he said he would be okay with prior to me leaving my home state. We are now in the middle of nowhere, where I have no friends or family. All I have is our son and him.

I think this subconsciously circled back to what I had told him a while ago, about how, if ‚Äúhis guys‚Äù come over for their music sessions (which I‚Äôm completely fine with by the way!), I would want them to leave by 9:30pm no later. He does music on the side. I always felt this was a reasonable request from me since we have a one year old.

Anyways, after encouraging him to just eat at home like I always do, I told him that if he wants Mcdonald‚Äôs, he can drive the 5-6 minutes down the road after work by switching seats with me. He didn‚Äôt like that I said that, so he went off again about how he‚Äôll just take the car to work everyday, which would leave me and our son trapped in the house til 5-6pm. I told him no, and that I‚Äôd like to take our son to the park from time to time. He started on again about how he makes the money, not me. 

When we get home, I tell him that I need to go upstairs for a while, because I was upset. He starts going on a rampage about how he shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äústuck‚Äù with our son when he just wanted to eat after work (keep in mind that I always eat while our son is with me, whether my husband is working or not, and I don‚Äôt complain). I eat with my son whether he is laying on my lap or if I have to eat standing up; half the time I end up not even finishing my food. My husband has always eaten in peace, by himself, in his bedroom. Also I don‚Äôt understand what he means by ‚Äúyou‚Äôve gotten to eat multiple times.‚Äù I‚Äôm lucky if I can even get 2 meals in the day. I really just survive on coffee at this point, which is fine.

As I go into our bedroom, he proceeds to yell to himself here and there‚Äîall of this is happening in front of our son, which is breaking my heart. After a few minutes, I hear him marching upstairs and slamming doors loudly, again, while holding our son; then I hear a loud bang, and ‚Äúhere‚Äôs your fucking food!‚Äù

I got my son not too long after. He then sent me these texts. After I didn‚Äôt entertain his initial text message by blocking him, he sent me the other through his business number. Then another via Snapchat, but he deleted that one.",23,1745418049.0,AmIOverreacting,144,0.74,False
1k60dlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1k60dlb/will_my_sleep_habits_ever_go_back_to_normal/,Will my sleep habits ever go back to normal?,"Since I had my baby almost six months ago, my sleep habits have completely changed. 

I used to regularly sleep 10-12 hours a night. Any less than that and I would be tired the next day. I was also an extremely light sleeper‚Äîthe sound of a doorknob turning or someone whispering my name would wake me up immediately. 

If I had to wake up at a specific time, I would set one alarm and wake up right away‚ÄîI never, ever snoozed alarms. When I lived with my family as a teenager, the sound of my siblings‚Äô alarms ringing in their bedrooms would wake me up before them. 

After having my son, I went through a period of pretty intense sleep deprivation for about three months until he started sleeping longer stretches at night. For a lot of reasons I won‚Äôt get into, I had to handle pretty much all the night wakes alone (this is not my husband‚Äôs fault). I spent weeks either sitting up awake holding him while he slept or waking up every 30 minutes - 1 hour overnight to nurse him. I was so sleep deprived I was hallucinating (I kept thinking I was seeing a cat running at me out of the corner of my eye‚Äîwe don‚Äôt have a cat). I drank a lot of coffee and pretty much felt like a zombie all the time.

Now my son is sleeping longer stretches at night, typically a 5-7 hour stretch sandwiched by a couple of 1-2 hour stretches at the start of the night and the morning. I‚Äôm still up with him probably 2-3 times a night, but he usually goes down again pretty quickly. 

Although I never sleep through my baby crying or generally making noise, I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm a much heavier sleeper now. I have to set multiple alarms and put my phone on my nightstand out of reach, or I‚Äôll snooze or shut them off in my sleep without even fully waking up. I have to be shaken awake if someone needs to wake me up. I used to wake up as soon as my husband got into bed with me, but now I don‚Äôt even realize and just keep sleeping.

I don‚Äôt like this‚ÄîI don‚Äôt feel like myself. I‚Äôm hoping that as my baby gets older and I continue to get a decent amount of sleep, my habits will slowly shift back. I would love to hear if anyone went through something similar and how your habits changed.",1,1745418042.0,beyondthebump,3,1.0,False
1k60d5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1k60d5y/i_pitched_my_state_a_local_publiclyfunded/,I pitched my state a local publicly-funded coworking space for entrepreneurs and recent grads in 2018 - and I believe the world ready for something like this in 2025,"We live in a time where an increasing percent (30%) of young adults live in their parents, and we're adapting away from the idea that that's failure-to-launch but rather the new reality - and not a shameful one. Similarly, it's more expensive than ever to be in cities where the most active startup communities are. Some cities have very weak or non-existent startup communities. Finally, it's easier than ever to build a startup/business as a solopreneur. 

However, without a community after college or while building your business (if you're an older entrepreneur), the experience can be extremely isolating. I would know - I tried to make it work in my city for 7 years and it was very isolating.

Our coworking/office space scene is drab and limited, and coffee shops can only do so much to create that electric environment I've experienced in places like Cross Campus Santa Monica (RIP) back in the day.

Imagine a large coworking space open to the public - free during the day and a membership fee for evening access.

I believe every city should have a large coworking space, funded by local/state governments, to encourage economic activity in the state - from startups, to startup hiring, to finding a cofounder. Having a space like this would bring hundreds of would-be entrepreneurs out of their homes and encourage them to interact. I want to see us expand the sort of serendipity that leads to the great successes out there. Because we all know so much is possible when you're with others who share that desire.

I'd love to hear if anyone finds this inspiring, objectionable, and/or if you have something like this in your city.",2,1745418011.0,Entrepreneur,3,1.0,False

Each quest room is a different ghosts theme like there's a BoHo hippy themed room for flower, a camping ground recreated for Pete, the viking room for Thor would probably be a hit for families with kids. Hettys room would be designed like her master suite when she was the lady of the house. Alberta would be very jazzy. Maybe even have some old bottles to decorate the room like a prohibition era speakeasy. Heck, they could do a dinosaur room for Issac and tell guests there was a caveman ghost if they wanted. (I have a room theme for most of the ghosts, but I don't want this post to be too long) It would also explain Sam and all her weird behavior, Sam and Jay sell the rooms as if Sam were a Medium who communicates with ghosts. It would also be a great way to get conventions to book the mansion. Ghost hunters, Bachelorette parties, influencers who film haunted house content. There would be times when a ghosts loved one would call Sam a fraud, and she'd have to subtly prove to them that she's not lying. Like telling Laura that her dad misses playing wedding with her and buying her snow globes. The Farnsbys would still be trying to shut down the mansion because they hate the crowd the 'haunted mansion' Brings until Sam comes over and freaks them out with facts about Judy Farnsby and how she's ashamed her son is a sexual deviant and they leave the Mansion alone again. It would be a great promotion for the restaurant too, on busy nights with a long wait you can wander around the Woodstone Mansion grounds looking for ghosts while you wait for your table to be ready. Jay could have fun themed nights for the ghosts sometimes like a pop-up. The guests could get a special breakfast menu hand picked by the ghosts: Sasappis' breakfast pizza, Pete Martino's s'more pancakes, Flowers contribution would be helping Sam to convince her ex Ira  that partnering with Woodstone would be great for Daisy's coffee and boom the mansion is partnered with a local business the town loves that regularly donates to local charities.",10,1745417970.0,GhostsCBS,5,0.81,False

When I leave and/or am NOT at work I do not want to physically move.  When I get home in the afternoon I have to sit down even though I have a desk job.  And my head feels like it's been in front of a speaker at a concert.  Most days I even picture things I need to do and cannot move my legs to stand up and do them.  

On Saturday mornings I wake up and have a very highly caffeinated beverage (be it an energy drink or stout coffee) and I just sit there and watch a video or TV, especially during football season.  And I feel like the world is awesome like I'm on a d\*ug or something.  Then an hour later I'm back to this paralyzed state of not being able to nearly function.

I do dishes, laundry and take the kids to events etc.  But that's only because clothes and dishes pile or up run out.  And the kids have set appointment times.  But the mere thought of going to the garage and just fixing something is impossible.  Mowing got to be such a stressor in my life and I'd put it off until weeds got stupid high sometimes.  Eventually I hired a lawn care company that took that off my plate.

Note: I'm undiagnosed and have never spoken to anyone about it.  But my wife wants me to see her doctor about it because I have all the symptoms and she says they're some of the worse ADHD she's ever seen in her opinion.

ANY advice, encouragement would help. thank you.",0,1745417832.0,ADHD,5,0.5,False

Im trying to find something similar to what i had when I lived out of state where a bunch of random people met up and did whatever their current craft/project was as a group. It wasnt a class or anything, just a group meeting up once a week to do their own craft while at a brewery or a tea/coffee shop. ",10,1745417749.0,AnnArbor,4,1.0,False
