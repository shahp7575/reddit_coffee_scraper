Essentially, anything remotely gun shaped, Izuku can make it function like a gun. Ammo limit varies depending on the size of the object, and is reloadable if the object has a replaceable part, such as a cartridge, container, batteries, etc…

The bullets fired are generally themed after whatever object he uses. For example, a pencil will fire little chunks of lead, a mailbox will fire letters and packages, a jar of peanut butter will fire peanuts. 

The ammo is also formed from matter shifted from the object itself, he can’t create matter from nothing, so if the object cannot be reloaded, he has limited ammo.

They tend to lean towards some kind of pun or play on words. Usually the more cringe the pun, the more powerful the gun.

During the USJ attack, Izuku grabbed an uprooted bush and it became a flamethrower (Bushfire). 

During the fight with Stain, Izuku used one of his knives he’d stabbed him with to fire little knives at him (knife gun).

He once used a bowl of bread rolls as single shot pistols (bun guns).

He once used a pack of gum as a gun (gum gun).

A cup of coffee (mug gun).

What are your opinions on this? This is exactly why I don't do this type of shit. I have it engraved in my head that 90% of times one night stands are just that.

also, after our coffee date i just saw i had some food stuck in my teeth, not something very bad but i felt like dying when i realised. this whole thing triggers so much anxiety in me, feels like i put myself in a fucked up situation and i fucked it up even more

2 more days and my trip ends

I came to this city with so much hope and thinking I would be going back with a happy heart with beautiful memories to cherish for life. After all I came here after 9 yrs!!

The city is beautiful I must say….

The weather. The air, the clear sky. Trees everywhere and the flowers…. Less traffic… less people… 

But what disappointed me?

People…. Most of them were my Reddit friends…

My school and college fellow were very welcoming and my school teacher as well. Had a lovely time with these three..

But what broke me was the attitude of people I knew the Reddit…

The girl… calling me everyday talking to me for hours sharing her stories and all and once she knew I was coming was insisting for me to stay at her home; I felt shy staying the whole trip so booked air b n b for half the trip n planned three days with her… she even pretended to be upset about the fact that I’ll be staying one day with my school friend and only giving her three days she literally got upset n fought with me k Aap mujhse Milne nai arahi isb?

And my answer was yes milna ha sab se milna ha but u know the main reason too…

Met her for lunch; paid ( as she said her salary is late) she did pay for coffee later.. so it was equal…

But next day when I was about to check out; she said she isn’t available from today onwards…. I was shocked … good I did’t leave the place … and so I extended my stay there n she said’ I was trying to use her … how was I using her I wonder… only Allah knows what people think n plan…

The guy friend on the other hand was so upset for me coming here… said I shud be married by now ( as if it’s in my hands) brought up arguments and ruined the time we spent together and later even told me I shud cut short my trip and go back…

Right now I’m at Centaurus mall. Roaming aimlessly looking at people. Friends … couples… why am I so unwelcome unwanted unloved… I am literally texting him k do din reh gaye hein… mil lo… chali jaongi.. phir shayed zindagi bhar na dekh sako mujhe… par uspe to koi asr hi nai hota…

I feel these two days will fly by …and soon I’ll be gone from ur city guys….

I wish people here with more warm; welcoming and friendly…

I still want to make the most of the two days…

I have a 34 gallon compost bin in my back garden(bought on Amazon, it has the feeling of a big plastic bag that you can zip closed and is dark green if anyone knows the one I am talking about. They come in two packs of 15 and 34 gallon). I've been using it to compost food scraps from the kitchen, mostly peelings, onion skins, the odd eggshell, lemon slices, tea-bags, coffee with filters etc. No meat or dairy.  
Yesterday we saw a rat(brown rat) in the garden scouting about, and this morning I saw it(or another rat, not sure) rummaging around in the compost, which to my surprise had toppled over and spilled out some food somehow(likely a fox rummaging at night).

I went to the compost bin, caused a bit of commotion with the shovel, and then covered it with some soil, dry leaves and wilted leaves that had been left out in a pile to use for composting. My plan is to continue this for a few days - am I doing the right thing?

I will be monitoring it, but is there anything else I can do? I will not put poison down as I have dogs and also don't want to kill the wildlife in the area(there is a lot, the odd fox does be walking by the compost and finding something to munch on some nights and we have a lot of birds, we also live next to a river)

The area we live in is a rural part of Ireland, there are cow fields and farms all around, a river nearby, some woodland, and an abandoned house nearby(which makes me wonder, do they shelter there... I know the owner so might mention to him if I see more.)

Any other ways of deterring them without killing them? I plan to stop adding to that compost for now, will they move on once they've eaten all they can? (It's maybe about a bucketful of food in there, and I have added mouldy food as well to deter them)

After 4 months on a diet plan and working with the dietitian, I managed to go down to \~165lbs +-1lb. After the plan, I was able to manage that weight till roughly spring this year. 

From spring to now, I've been putting on about 1lb a month. I count my calories and exercise 4-5 times a week (all cardio). Without weighing my food and going by nutrition facts & rough estimates, I am eating about 1500 cals per day. 

I will admit that although I don't make exactly what's is on my dietitian's food play every day still, I do cook a lot of home meals and all of them relatively low in calories due to the ingredients I'm using. When the family gets takeout, I will either get something healthier from the restaurant or make something at home. Another thing I will admit to is not drinking enough water. My liquid diet consists of coffee with milk and zero calorie sodas/energy drinks.

So I wanted to reach out and ask people who gained it all back and lost it again, what was your secret to success? Maybe it can help & encourage myself and others who are experiencing this problem get back on track.",1,1765893458.0,loseit,3,0.67,False

These are the types of things I crave to know about the people around me and that they knew these things about me too. Do you really know someone? No. But you can know all the little things that makes them that someone to you ❤️ I'm not sure if this an ADHD thing or just a me thing but I'd love to share my mundanities and hear yours in return! 

My hair is my favorite thing on my body. I have only had continuous long term relationships since I was 15 years old. I snorted coriander in home ec class at school and have hated coriander ever since (not sure if that was because I already hated it or if that caused the hatred).

He ended things pretty badly/awkwardly and so he deleted me off everything. It look me a while to get over this man because he was my first experience with men. 

Anyways fast forward 5 years later, in September, he’s reached out to me on Facebook to apologise how he treated me and that I was ‘owed’ an apology. While I got a lil intrigued to see his name pop up, I’m angry. I guess  I’m disappointed that after 5 years later, he’s only come back to say sorry and nothing more. We had a lil back and fourth and I forgave him, but I left the message on read when he told me to ‘take care of myself’… because that’s all he came back for, only to apologise. And if anything, I felt like the apology was for him to heal from this. 

I wish I just never opened the message. Because a part of me was hoping that man changed and wanted to reconcile, perhaps try again. 

I don’t know what to do guys… when I got this message I was on holidays so I didn’t really process this, but I wish I kept the convo going… or maybe suggest to meet up for a coffee. I didn’t ask him about his life or updates. I simply just forgave him and left the conversation with him to lead. But it didn’t play how I wanted it to.

Now I crave more but I don’t want to be stupid and run back all over again. My mind is racing, should I just leave it? Will he come back again? Why did he apologise now? It’s been 5 years… was it because he was turning 30 this year and had a few cracks to fix before he entered his new decade? Idk I’m just angry guys…",1,1765893332.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

1po2ius,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1po2ius/tifu_by_confidently_waving_back_at_someone_who/,TIFU by confidently waving back at someone who was absolutely not waving at me,"This occurred earlier today, and I can't stop replaying it in my mind like a cursed highlight reel.

I was at a coffee shop, sitting by the window, feeling like the main character for once. Dressed cute, headphones in, sipping my drink, just minding my own business. I glanced up and noticed someone outside making direct eye contact with me and waving their hand in a friendly manner.

Naturally, I waved back.

Not just a small wave, either. It was a full, enthusiastic ""oh hey!!"" wave. I even smiled. I was really committed to it.

The person's expression instantly shifted to confusion. Then horror. Then they awkwardly continued walking.

That's when it hit me there was a guy directly behind me.

The wave wasnt meant for me.
It was never meant for me.

I slowly turned around and saw this man enthusiastically waving back at the person outside, who was now also realizing what had just happened. They locked eyes. They waved again. It was clear they knew each other.

I was just sitting there. Frozen. My hand still in the air as if I was pledging allegiance to embarrassment.

The guy behind me gave me a polite, pity-filled smile. I dropped my hand, stared into my coffee as if it could save me, and immediately put my headphones back on, even though nothing was playing.

I didnt move for a solid ten minutes. I even thought about leaving the city. Maybe the state.

Eventually, I mustered the courage to stand up, but I swear everyone in the café could feel the weight of what had just happened.

So yeah. Just a reminder that sometimes the universe humbles you for no reason at all.

TL;DR: I mistakenly thought a stranger was waving at me, waved back way too confidently, realized the wave was for someone behind me, and went through a full-body embarrassment shutdown in public.",2,1765893305.0,tifu,4,0.6,False

# 💡 Final Tactical Note: The ""Cheat Sheet"" Strategy

Print this list. Highlight the **3 ""Power Stories""** from your own life that can answer almost any behavioral question (e.g., one story about a Failure, one about Leadership, one about Conflict).

* If they ask about **Conflict** \-> Use Story A.
* If they ask about **Communication** \-> Use Story A (tweak the focus).
* If they ask about **Pressure** \-> Use Story A (tweak the focus).

You don't need 100 answers. You need 3 good stories and the ability to pivot them.

1po2d9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanningsnark/comments/1po2d9b/am_i_wrong_to_have_a_wedding_in_same_year_as/,Am I wrong to have a wedding in same year as friend?,"Need advice! I’ve got a longtime friend (10+ years) who got engaged this year. I was excited, immediately we met up and we talked lots about her dreams, wishes, plans. She locked down a wedding date for 2026 and asked me to be bridesmaid.

Fast forward to a few months later - I got engaged! I invited her to a small celebration which she declined on the day, saying she was sick. I then didn’t hear from her - she was busy for a month with seeing other friends, doing exercises classes, working… and couldn’t make time to celebrate. I called to ask what was wrong - no response, said job was busy. When we finally met for a short coffee, she asked questions about the date I’d be married and appeared very defensive. Things felt very off.

She sent a card expressing that she was grateful we are friends out of the blue. Yet two weeks later, I find out that she has planned a bachelorette with other girls for many months, aligning on multiple nights, abroad destination, and picked a month. I was taken aback to have not been clued in, asked explicitly how I could help and what she needed from me. A day later, I receive a message from the bachelorette ‘organiser’ that the date has been picked already. I had pre agreed to attend another wedding on that weekend, so I cannot make it. The bride appeared unbothered when I expressed confusion that a date had been picked without any input from me - she ignored my texts and started a new conversation, but has made pass agg comments since.

To be completely honest, I feel like this friendship has hit a dead end. There appears to be simmering resentment which cannot be hashed out. 

It actually made me not enjoy my engagement, but I’m having a hard time letting go, though. I don’t think this friend wants an open relationship, where there is room for two people. I think she wants things on her terms, the attention on her, and I can’t offer that now I am planning my own wedding. As my fiance has family in ill health, we may need to do something fairly quickly. I want to be great friends, as we were before, share things together and celebrate each other. But it feels very hard to do that right now. What do people think I should do?",2,1765892884.0,weddingplanningsnark,2,1.0,False
1po2ce4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1po2ce4/i_29m_had_a_toxic_breakup_with_my_girlfriend_34f/,I (29m) had a toxic breakup with my girlfriend (34F) because I couldn't handle the drama anymore. Now I feel so confused and guilty for not giving her a chance. How do I stop feeling so guilty?,"Hi everyone!

A few months ago I met a woman in Korea through bumble. She's Japanese and we met for coffee. The red flags were already there but I chose to ignore them. She told me her last relationship was only a couple of days ago and that she kissed someone at a club the night before we met. She was also a divorcee and she complained about her exes constantly. Later on in the relationship she told me that her body count was over 100. I blame myself for ignoring the red flags.

We had a nice date and she continued to text me after that. She then asked me to come to Japan to see her. After 3 weeks, I booked my flight to her city Nagoya and we had a good time. We kissed and after a week she asked me if I wanted to be exclusive. I liked her a lot so I said yes. I extended my trip by renting an apartment for one month and we moved in together. Big mistake.

I started to notice that she sulked almost everyday because of minor things like me not washing the dishes right away or working while she did the laundry. I would have no problem if she just asked me to help, but instead she would sulk until I asked repeatedly what was wrong. This type of conflict happened daily until I confronted her and told her that she needed to communicate with me calmy like an adult instead of sulking all the time and making me guess what the issue is. She completely panicked. She started shaking and begging me not to break up with her. She even went to the bathroom to throw up. I was shocked by this reaction. I calmed her down and said I just wanted to have a conversation and that I didn't want to break up. After that we made up but I was still a bit shocked.

We had a lot of good moments together but also a few extremely exhausting arguments that lasted until the early hours of the morning. One argument started because a dating app ad appeared on my youtube video and she took it as a sign that I was using dating apps, which was untrue. She cried and would shake until I calmed her down. Another argument started because she was extremely jealous and wanted to know more about my ex who was famous in Japan. She told me to be honest or she would dump me. She asked me my ex's name and I told her. She then cried hysterically and said she wanted to break up because now she was going to always have the urge to look up my ex's name on Google. I told her that is a crazy response because she wanted the name and I told her. We argued until the early hours again and we apologized to each other after much exhaustion. One argument started because she was upset that I used headphones when playing online games with my friends. Yes really. That fight had her packing her bags and wanting to pretend break up. She kept on delaying leaving my house and then asked me to walk her to the station. I realized she was just playing a game for attention and I said ""This is the last time we're doing this silly game. Come on, let's go home."" She came and said she was so worried about breaking up and that she loves me.

Other unnecessary arguments include her getting angry and leaving the restaurant because she asked me what her accent sounds like. I said it sounds Japanese, which caused her to sulk and leave the restaurant in a hurry without even waiting for me to pay the bill. Another argument started because she told me she sometimes gets dog hair in her food at home but she still eats it. I asked if that was sanitary because maybe her dog was dirty. She then went to the bathroom and cried. She showed me a paragraph written by ChatGPT explaining how what I said was heartless and that I was attacking her beloved dog.

She would get extremely upset over tiny things and I tried my best to tell her that it wasn't normal for anyone to get so upset over small things. She also played childish mind-games to get my attention. She has depression and takes medication but I told her that maybe therapy would also be a good idea. She refused and whenever I tried to tell her that she needed to communicate better and stop playing games to get my attention, she said that I was blaming and attacking her character. She also said she hated it when guys said she played games. Sometimes when I tried to communicate how I felt, she would refuse to listen by putting on headphones or screaming at me to shut up. After a while I realized that there was nothing I could do to make her realize how toxic her behavior was because she would always tell me that I was hurting her and blaming her.

She was also very paranoid about me cheating. She once got upset because one of the socks from my luggage looked too small and she thought it was from another girl. Another time she came to my house after a 2 days and saw that I did my washing. She wondered why I washed so many items and thought that I went out to see other girls. One time, she noticed a hickey on my neck that she gave me a few days prior. The problem was she completely forgot she gave it to me in the first place and then cried and accused me of cheating. So sometimes when she had to go to her parents for the weekend, she would give me hickeys to ensure that I wouldn't cheat and see other women.

The last straw was on a particular day in which was she being too difficult and childish. She had a bad day at work the night before because of a difficult customer. Before we met to go to the mall, we called and she was cold. When I said at the end of the call: ""I love you, Bye"", she just said ok and hung up. We went shopping for clothes at the mall, and I noticed she walked ahead of me super quickly until I was lost and couldn't see her. Eventually I found her and asked what happened. She said something along the lines of ""Oh now you notice me instead of looking at your phone"". When we got home, she got sulky again because I didn't kiss her before I tried out my new clothes. She then took a nap and asked me to wake her up after an hour. 2 hours went by and I completely forgot to wake her up earlier. I woke her up and she was sulky again because I didn't wake her up sooner.

On the way to the restaurant, she walked super fast in front of me again like earlier that day when she was upset with me for looking at my phone. This time, I told her to stop and talk to me. I told her that it was exhausting to deal with her childish tendency to sulk and then expect me to pry until I found out what the problem was and then apologize. She had already gotten upset with me 3 times in the past 5 hours. She then said nothing was wrong and that she was just walking fast because she wanted to get to the restaurant before it closed. I asked if she was sure because she gets upset so often that its so difficult to know what I've done wrong. This made her so upset that she started walking home. I told her to wait and talk me and that we didn't need to fight. I asked her to please just talk to me and I assured her that I love her. She refused and told me she was going to her parent's house. I said that wasn't necessary and that she just needed to talk to me like an adult. She took that as criticism and told me to please not hurt her anymore with my words. I then tried to explain that not every argument needs to erupt so badly like this and we can just talk calmy. She told me to shut up and when I tried to finish what I was saying, she screamed so loudly that everyone started to watch. That was it. I got up and walked home, texting her to go to her parent's house and that I would leave her stuff for her to pick up outside my apartment the next day.

I got home and noticed she blocked me on whatsapp and Instagram. I thought that was the end until she came to my apartment and tried to apologise. She said she was sorry for screaming but that I was also bad for asking if she was upset and doubting her feelings. I didn't accept her apology and told her to pack and leave. She was angry and went into the apartment, slamming the door. I left while she packed

While I was outside, she tried to call me repeatedly and I rejected them all. I told her I was serious about breaking up and that I wasn't coming home until she left. She left me tons of messages and missed calls. After an hour, I came back home and she was gone along with all her belongings.

She later texted me that it was unfair of me to blame her and that I made her feel worthless when I told her that she needs to stop playing games and communicate properly. I told her that she did do that and that I was just trying to tell her the truth. She refused to accept that she was a bad communicator and just started telling me that I was hurting her and making her feel worthless. I tried so hard to make her see what she did was toxic behavior but she just got upset and played the victim every time I tried to tell her my feelings. I never got angry with her while trying to tell her this. I never said any hurtful or rude things to her. I just wanted to tell her the truth and that was she was 34 and should know better than to communicate like a spoiled child.

After a back and forth of me trying to make her understand that she was a bad communicator, I told her that I would only be with her if she went to therapy. She saw this as an attack on her character and then shifted blame on me again. I said there's nothing we can do then and I ended it. She asked me to block her and I did. A few days later she messages me on IG accusing me of cheating on her. She blocked me before I could respond. Then I message her by SMS and tell her that I never cheated and that she was using this lie as an excuse for her toxic behavior. She refused to listen to anything I said and continuously said that I was hurting her by saying that she needs to go to therapy before she's ready for any relationship in the future. I told her that she exhibits severe toxic traits and I sent her a link to a Youtube video that talked about the warning signs of a toxic woman. This upset her deeply and she blocked me.

I am so disappointed that this relationship turned out the way it did. I have never had a problem like this in any of my previous relationships but now I feel so conflicted and guilty because I didn't accept her apology for screaming at me in public. I truly am starting to think that maybe I'm the toxic one for telling the blunt truth to a person with depression. How do I stop this doubt and start to feel proud of myself for standing up to myself instead?

**TL;DR:** I broke up with my depressed girlfriend because I was exhausted from all the drama and her childish games meant to get my attention. She screamed at me in public and I broke up with her without listening to her half-assed apology. I tried so hard to make her understand that her behavior was toxic and unhealthy but she would always shift the blame on me by saying I was hurting her with my words. I feel so frustrated because now she thinks I cheated on her and therefore she will never take responsibility for her toxic behavior and continue to blame others for her problems. I have so much guilt for not accepting her apology and I'm not sure how to feel about this. How do I stop feeling so guilty?",1,1765892821.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I started making games in the 1990s and grew up using 320x200 pixel resolutions with 256 colors - yay! Pixels have always fascinated me. And isometric art. Aaaand: adventure games. So I thought, why not combine all three and make my own isometric pixel art adventure? The result has just been released after years of spare time being spent.

After a wild party night, you wake up on Saturday craving nothing more than a strong cup of coffee - only to discover that something you brought home, something with a legendary reputation, has gone missing. What begins as a quiet weekend spirals into a race against an escalating olfactory biohazard aboard Orbital Station E-17.

Navigate 8-bit corridors, decipher retro-futuristic mishaps, and try to contain the crisis before the crew returns on Monday. Good luck!

1po2ak5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1po2ak5,The Dreadmill 48 Hr - 151 miles to nowhere,"Last weekend I ran the [Dreadmill 48 hour Endurance Challenge](https://share.google/7RQ2ZttrNPjsC9jtG)

This event is exactly what it sounds like, 48 hours of treadmill, to see who can run the furthest, this was my 7th 100+ mile race, and it went amazingly well.

In 2024 I did the 100 mile variant of the event, finishing in just about 22 hours, and it was the most difficult miserable experience of my life. The monotony was rough, but the heat, chafing, and repetitive beating of being on a treadmill hits you like a truck after 70+ miles. 

After the 2024 event I said I would NEVER do this again, and well, I didn't do the 100 again, instead I did the 48 hour, and reached 151 miles!!

I woke up Friday morning at 2:30 a.m. ate breakfast, drank coffee, and did the all-important bathroom routine. I spent a few minutes scrolling my phone to get that last digital dopamine spike I'd be receiving for a long time, and by 3:40 a.m. I was up and getting moving on the machine.

I went into this run with 3 separate goals

1) set a distance PR. My previous best was ~103 miles at a 24 hour event in June, so I wanted to surpass that at the very minimum. I was confident in my ability to do this, with all the extra time, but in 100 mile distances anything can happen.

2) 125+ miles. I am running the Sedona canyons 125 in May, so getting to 125 miles felt like it would be a mental win.

3) 150+ miles, this was a stretch goal, I had no idea what would happen beyond mile 100, if the wheels would fall off, how I would handle the sleep deprivation, etc.


I planned to break the run, roughly, into marathons, knowing that 4 would get me my distance PR, 5 would get me to goal 2 of 125 miles, and 6 marathons would cross off 150 miles (and get the special 150 mile buckle!)

I ran the first marathon (actually 27.27 miles) in exactly 5 hours. This felt very easy and comfortable, my HR stayed nice and low, and I fuelled well.

After the first marathon I took a few minutes to eat some real food and use the restroom, and then I started marathon 2.

Marathon 2 (27.73 miles) was completed in just over 5 hours, and once again felt quite good.. at this point I was at mile 55 and still running smooth.

I took a longer break to eat an entire pizza and drink some coke.

I started marathon 3 at 3pm, and it went well for the first few hours, but around mile 70 my hips and knees started to really bother me. This was my first point where I began to feel nervous about my goals. I wasn't even halfway done and the pain was getting rough.

I pushed on to the end of the marathon (27 miles) to reach mile 82. At this point it was a bit after 9pm, and I decided I'd try to do some recovery, so I sat in the sauna drinking fluids and electrolytes with my feet up, and then tried to nap. 

At 12:30a.m. I got moving again, I don't think I slept more than an hour due to the significant discomfort, so I decided to just go.

I began *""marathon""* 4 with a walk, and just kept it slow and steady for a while until my hips and knees loosened up.

Miles 75-100 were probably the most uncomfortable miles of the event, they weren't physically the worst, but they were close, and mentally they were a battle.

As the miles ticked away, the sun started to rise, and my wife and kids came down from their rooms to greet me, and I got a second wind. 

I pushed this *""marathon""* to 42 miles... Reaching mile 125 by noon on Saturday. 

At this point I had been running for 32 hours.

I got off the treadmill, and ate another full pizza, drank a bunch of soda, and lemonade, and coffee, then took a shower, and fell asleep HARD for an hour. I woke up around 1:30pm, and got moving again at 2.

Hopping back on the treadmill at 2pm was a mental relief, I knew at this point that 150 miles **WAS GOING TO HAPPEN** I still had 13h40m remaining to just walk 25 miles, I only had to walk 2mph...

But I had no intention of walking it in. I set off on a brisk walk with short run intervals, running 1 mile every 3-4 for the next couple hours.

As I got closer, I felt better and better, and actually started running longer intervals... Then suddenly at mile 140 the wheels fell off and I had to take another 20 minute nap!

I got up, got moving again, and walk/jogged it to mile 147.

Once I hit 147, I forced myself to run the rest of the way to 150, and actually clocked off some decently fast miles to finish.

Once I hit mile 150, I slowed to a crawl of a walk, and walked 1 last mile for good measure, and called it a day at 8:52pm.

After 41 hours and 12 minutes of treadmill running, I was done.

I had reached 151 miles, and gone absolutely nowhere, but it was an incredible journey, and I'm insanely proud of the achievement.

Now it's time to recover, because I have the black canyon 100k & 50k echo challenge coming up in February!",38,1765892681.0,Ultramarathon,7,0.95,False
1po2a84,https://www.reddit.com/r/glasses/comments/1po2a84/has_anyone_here_actually_replaced_their_main/,Has anyone here actually replaced their main glasses with smart glasses?,"Im asking because I'm curious if anyone else has made this work. I've been experimenting with audio glasses for a year now (tried Bose Frames, Lucyd Lyte, and Echo Frames at different points). They handle the core stuff well enough (audio, calls, notifications), and they mostly pass as regular glasses visually. But I always kept them as a ""secondary tech pair"" because something always felt off about wearing them full-time.

Bose frames sounded great, but the arms are fairly chunky and the weight plus clamp force started to bother me after a few hours; they feel more like ""going out"" sunglasses than something I'd wear all day at a desk. Lucyd Lyte did a nice job of blending in and kept the weight reasonable (around 40+ grams on the pair I tried), but after a long day you can still tell there's extra tech on the sides, especially if you already wear prescription lenses. Echo Frames lean into Alexa and voice control, which is handy, but again you're working with a battery that's designed more around a work day with breaks rather than something you forget about entirely.

Stumbled across Dymesty while researching lighter alternatives. the titanium smart glasses comes in around 35g, so on my face it's very close to a typical lightweight prescription frame rather than a gadget. There's no camera or little screen, just what look like regular glasses, with tiny speakers and an AI assistant hiding in the temples. Because they're that light, I'm comfortable wearing them from morning coffee through commute, work, and errands.

What convinced me was they actually work with prescriptions. I'm nearsighted with astigmatism and needed progressives, which I figured would be a dealbreaker. But you can either order prescription lenses directly (upload your specs like Warby Parker) or get frames only and have your local optician fit them. all the standard coatings are available too (blue light, anti-scratch, water-resistant stuff). so I wasn't compromising on the eyewear fundamentals.

my experience with smart glasses is basically one that can quietly handle calls, read back meeting notes through the AI assistant, and play podcasts or music during my commute, all without the blinking lights or ""I'm wearing a gadget on my face"" vibe. The audio quality isn't audiophile-grade, but it's clear enough for calls and decent for casual listening. the AI piece is genuinely useful for quick lookups or dictating reminders when my hands are full, and because there's no camera, i don't get the awkward ""are you recording me?"" reactions in meetings or coffee shops.

Bose, Lucyd and Echo Frames all have their place: Bose for sound, Lucyd for style variety, Echo for people who live in the Alexa ecosystem. Dymesty just happens to be the one smart glasses comparison i tried that feels most like a regular pair of glasses.

Curious what people think, if you already wear glasses daily, would you ever swap your main pair for something that looks and feels similar but quietly adds audio and AI interaction? Or do you prefer keeping your glasses as they are and letting headphones or earbuds handle the rest?

I am writing to you all because I need your advice and opinion. I have been in a study group for almost three months now. There are about 15 people in this study group, including a lady whom I find very interesting. She caught my eye on the very first day.

Most of the time, I have been very focused on studying when I am in this group. For several weeks now, I have had the impression that she is looking at me, briefly, but repeatedly. She sits at the other end of the room. I have caught her doing this several times. She speaks very positively and admiringly about me in the study group. What also strikes me is that she talks very openly with everyone except me. She rarely talks to me, but when she does, she is friendly.

I am toying with the idea of asking her out, as the study period is coming to an end soon. I really like her a lot. The question is, does she like me too? A few days ago, I wanted to test the waters. What I did was look at her and smile. I looked her straight in her eyes, confidently. I smiled slightly as I did so. She noticed it immediately and looked me in the eye too, but without any expression. Neither confirming nor rejecting. She didn't look away when I looked her in the eye. She seemed petrified. She didn't move at all, not even a little bit and she didn't break eye contact. The whole thing lasted about three or four seconds; I didn't want to do it for any longer than that. I didn't want to make her uncomfortable, so I broke eye contact and went to get a coffee.

Even after that, her behaviour towards me did not worsen. Sometimes she laughs at my jokes and sometimes she repeats my sentences and laughs (sometimes she listens to me, even when I'm not talking directly to her), albeit rarely.

The next day, I wasn't in the study group because I had an exam. She was. The following day, I was back in the group. So was she. That day, she was dressed more beautifully than ever before. She dressed more beautifully than usual, just for a study group? Sometimes I wonder whether it's a coincidence or whether there's more to it than that.

How do you assess the overall situation, also with regard to the eye contact I have established? Could she be interested?

I am aware that the man has to make the first move and accept the risk of rejection. I have no problem with that. However, I don't want to make a fool of myself either.",0,1765892386.0,bodylanguage,1,0.5,False

1po231a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1po231a/mf_apocalypse_tomorrow_maybe/,"[MF] Apocalypse Tomorrow, Maybe","Mrs. Struthio checked on the loaf of bread she had left out to cool earlier that morning. Finding it no longer warm to the touch, she nodded approvingly and took a large, serrated bread knife out of the drawer, cutting the loaf into thick slices. Usually, she would not be so wasteful, but one of the larger bags of flour was about to spoil, and she wanted to use it all up before it went bad. Besides, this was a special occasion - a little celebration was in order. Setting aside the bread knife, she opened the pantry and took out three of the large plates the family used for breakfast. She mentally checked what she had prepared as she set the table with the plates and mismatched cutlery. To pair with the luxury of fresh bread, she had taken some sausages out of the deep freezer in the basement. Although her husband disliked it when she took from the precious stock of meat he had built up, he had been talking about tonight for a week now - he would surely understand that this was not to be an everyday thing. Satisfied that her preparations were complete, she nodded once more to herself and called her husband and daughter for breakfast.

 Her husband, Mr. Struthio, was already downstairs and came to the table as soon as she called. He was a beast of a man, and lumbered in from the living room before plopping himself into his designated chair at the head of the table and waiting for his wife to place the dishes on the table. She set some toasted slices of her fresh bread on the table, along with a jar of wild blackberry preserve that she had made two autumns ago. Next to it, she settled the plate of sausages, which Mr. Struthio reached for immediately, and a bowl of soft-boiled eggs from the chickens in the backyard.

“Eleanor!” Mrs. Struthio cried once more, “Breakfast is ready! Come down!”

“That girl,” sighed Mr. Struthio, unfolding his paper carefully from where Mrs. Struthio had left it at his spot at the table. “What are we going to do with her? So lazy. My dear,” he changed the subject tactfully, “Is the coffee ready yet?” Mrs. Struthio hummed noncommittally as she fetched the coffee pot from the kitchen and poured each of them a mug. They were going to have to cut down on the amount they drank, Mrs. Struthio thought to herself, as the beans would likely be one of the first things to go stale, and their Pennsylvania backyard was hardly the ideal climate for growing their own. A shame, she liked using the grounds in her garden.

Eleanor finally descended the stairs with all the usual fanfare of a teenager being told to do something they did not like. She was a pretty girl, believed Mrs. Struthio, although of course, as her mother, she was biased. She was beginning to get control of her teenage acne, and Mrs. Struthio made a note to stock up on the moisturizer that she liked when she went to the store later.

“So,” Mrs. Struthio said, “today’s the big day.”

Eleanor huffed out a laugh at that. “Sure it is. Just like the last time. Or the one before that.”

“Eleanor!” Mrs. Struthio gasped as Mr. Struthio threw down his paper in frustration.

“Can’t we just have one pleasant breakfast!?” Mr. Struthio snapped, ”You should be grateful that your family is prepared - think of all the poor folks out there who don’t have a clue what’s coming for them!” Eleanor ignored them; she seemed to have suddenly decided that the process of spreading jam on her toast required her undivided attention. With a great *humph*, Mr. Struthio picked his paper back up and briefly muttered to himself. The silence that followed hung heavy above their heads.. In an attempt to break the macabre spell cast over them, she spoke.

“I was planning on going to the store today,” she said, “one last run for the necessities. I have flour, tinned fish, and coffee on the list, but is there anything else I should get while I’m there?”

“Some beans,” Mr. Struthio grumbled, “can never have too many of those dried beans. Get the good ones, though. No sense in worrying about money at this point.”

	“Of course, dear. I’ll get a few cans of those kidney beans you like, too. What about you, Eleanor?” Eleanor glanced up and saw her father engrossed in his newspaper.

Happy to be ignored, she added hopefully, “Maybe some cookies,” before returning to poking at her toast.

“You’ll come with me, won’t you? I’ll be going to the bulk-supply store for the flour, and I’ll need an extra pair of hands to bring it to the car, and your father will be busy checking on the garden and the chickens.”

“Sure,” Eleanor said mildly, “It’s not as if I have anything better to do.”

Delighted at the prospect of spending this momentous day with her daughter, Mrs. Struthio hummed happily as she cleared the table. She didn’t bother washing the dishes just yet, preferring to leave them for after her shopping trip, but made a great show of putting the leftover food away for later. “Can’t start wasting food now, can we?” she asked nobody in particular. Her husband grunted an acknowledgement as she put the leftover sausage into the fridge. Like the deep freezer, it was hooked up to their generator, which was in turn powered by the solar panels lining their roof, so it would likely run for a while yet.

Once she had put the remains of breakfast away, she nodded proudly to herself as she surveyed the kitchen, which was perfectly clean apart from the stack of plates and cups waiting patiently in the sink. They would need to spend a great deal of time indoors in the coming months, and a tidy home is a tidy mind after all. She went to get a comfortable pair of shoes and changed into them from the baby blue house slippers she had put on this morning. She called for Eleanor once more, and she came down the stairs. 

In a good mood, Mrs. Struthio idly suggested, “Why don’t you drive us there, dear? This will be our last peaceful outing for a while; it’s a good chance for you to get some practice in.”

Eleanor eyed the keys Mrs. Struthio was dangling cautiously before reaching under to catch them, as if she did not want to touch her mother directly. This annoyed Mrs. Struthio, but she refused to let her mood sour - this was a momentous day, after all. She loaded the box full of large, reusable canvas totes she used for groceries into the trunk of the family’s station wagon as Eleanor started the car. As Mrs. Struthio slid into the passenger seat, she saw that the gas tank was only half-full and made a mental note to have Eleanor stop by the gas station on the way there. As they drove to the store, Mrs. Struthio instructed Eleanor to stop here and there to pick up various odds and ends they were missing. They stopped at the hardware store for a roll of chicken wire, at the pharmacy for a tub of vaseline and two tubes of Eleanor’s favorite moisturizer, and at the greengrocer for a bit of fruit. As she turned over apples and squeezed avocados, Mrs. Struthio explained to Eleanor that the garden plants wouldn’t be fruiting for a while, so even though they would eventually have fresh fruit again, this would be the last they had for a while. Eleanor nodded neutrally as she spoke, and Mrs. Struthio felt her spirits lift once again. Sure, Eleanor could be difficult, she thought to herself, but she was a good girl - she would be alright, especially once it was just the three of them; she would understand that her mother and father only wanted what was best for her.

The car lapsed into silence as they pulled into the sprawling parking lot of the bulk food store. It was busier than usual - but then again, it always was on Sundays such as these. It wasn’t yet raining, but heavy gray clouds hung from the sky like guillotines, threatening a downpour. Too apprehensive about the rain to do the usual hiking and canoeing popular in the area, locals and tourists alike turned to one of the few indoor activities the small town had to offer: shopping. But this was a little town, with a population that barely brushed past one thousand in a good year. There were no sprawling strip malls or sky-scraping shopping centers; the most popular shops in the town were an ice cream parlor attached to an antique store, and the bulk foods store.

At first, Mrs. Struthio had disliked the sparse population of the town, but in time, the solitude of the countryside was something she had come to appreciate. She had been hesitant to marry her husband at one point, disliking the idea of another person in her house; luckily, they were birds of a feather in that sense, and spent most of the day in their respective realms: him in the library and fields, and her in her kitchen and bedroom. The second floor of the house was Eleanor’s territory - it contained her beloved bedroom, library, and a grand bathroom. The only truly communal spaces in the house were the dining room and the basement, which served as a cellar; meals were the only time the family consistently came together.

They were lucky today and found parking close to the entrance, and Mrs. Struthio sent Eleanor to get a shopping cart as she reviewed her list. Written in black ballpoint pen, it read: *flour, tinned fish (sardines),* and *coffee*. Scribbled underneath with a different, blue ballpoint were *beans* and *chocolate chips*. After a moment of thought, she pulled the blue pen out of her purse and added *rice* and *cooking oil* to her list. When Eleanor returned with the cart, Mrs. Struthio had her read it aloud and nodded approvingly. They went about their shopping as usual, Eleanor waiting patiently by the cart as her mother carefully turned over everything put into it. As she shopped, Mrs. Struthio explained to her the criterion by which she was choosing their food, to which Eleanor nodded dully, occasionally accompanied by an affirmative “uh-huh.” This continued until they passed by the prepared foods section of the store. It had been several hours since breakfast now, and the pair of them were beginning to grow hungry. Mrs. Struthio came to a sudden stop in front of the display of neatly packaged rotisserie chickens, causing Eleanor to run into her with the cart. She gave Eleanor a quick look of reproach, but didn’t scold her.

“Are you hungry, dear?” Mrs. Struthio asked.

“I could eat,” Eleanor responded. Her mind made up, Mrs. Struthio selected a rotisserie chicken from the display, which she subjected to the same careful inspection as she had everything else. They would have this for lunch, she decided, and take advantage of the time they saved to see if Mr. Struthio needed any help in the fields. 

Her shopping complete, Mrs. Struthio and Eleanor waited in the obscenely long check-out line, at the end of which the cashier seemed to find it necessary to comment on each purchase. This sort of forced social interaction would ordinarily annoy Mrs. Struthio, but a combination of anticipation for tonight and the pleasure she felt at seeing her daughter so obedient had put her in a good mood, so she didn’t particularly mind making small talk just this once. Once the purchases were all placed in the canvas bags she had brought from home, Mrs. Struthio had Eleanor bring the car to the front of the store, and loaded it there. Taking care to return the cart to the row Eleanor had gotten it from, she returned to the car, the passenger-side door shutting behind her with a satisfying *click*. They sat in silence once more as Eleanor cautiously pulled out of the parking lot. Once they hit the paved road marking the start of their 45-minute drive home, Eleanor spoke.

“Mom, can I ask you something?”

“Of course, dear anything.” Mrs. Struthio replied. Eleanor let out a bark of laughter at that, which she unsuccessfully attempted to disguise as a cough.

“You don’t really believe all of this… doomsday stuff, do you?”

Mrs. Struthio didn’t respond right away. Rather, she found that she couldn’t. She pursed her lips, took a shaky breath, and replied.

“I’m not quite sure what you mean, darling.”

Eleanor seemed to sense her mother’s shift in attitude, and her voice took on a placating tone.

“I mean this end of the world crap… I mean, you can’t *really* think the world’s going to end tonight. I know that dad buys into it, but you’re-”

“That’s enough.” Mrs. Struthio interrupted, her fury running cold, “Pull over, Eleanor.”

Eleanor cast her a nervous glance, but pulled over obediently. Once the car had come to a stop on the shoulder of an empty road lined on either side by soybean fields, Mrs. Struthio opened the car door without saying a word and stepped out. She paused for a moment, took another shaky breath, and reminded herself. *She’s just a child. She doesn’t know any better,* before circling over to the driver’s side of the car and jerking the door open. Eleanor gave her a startled look, as if the girl had not expected this reaction. *What a fool,* Mrs. Struthio thought viciously, *what else could she have expected?* And suddenly, she felt rather foolish herself; it was her fault for sending Eleanor for a public education - she had made all sorts of unsavory friends there, who filled her head with nonsense.

“Get out,” Mrs. Struthio commanded. Eleanor scrambled to obey. “I will drive us the rest of the way.” Eleanor made her way around the car as Mrs. Struthio seethed in the driver’s seat. She closed the door cautiously behind her, and the drive home was finished in complete silence. Mrs. Struthio had meant to scold Eleanor properly when they arrived home, but the girl was used to this pattern and fled upstairs the moment the station wagon stopped. Mrs. Struthio had half a mind to go after her, but stopped herself. The girl would realize how wrong she was tonight, and she had to come down to eat eventually. Besides, the upstairs of the house was Eleanor’s realm - any encroachment into it left Mrs. Struthio with a queasy feeling in her stomach.

Instead, she stalked to the back of the car, her cold fury boiling once more as she unpacked their groceries. The rotisserie chicken was not necessary after all, as it seemed Eleanor would not be coming down for lunch. Mrs. Struthio set it to chill in the fridge and decided to make it into chicken salad for their dinner. Eleanor hated mayonnaise, but she shouldn’t have stormed off like that if she wished to have a say in dinner. She put the coffee and sardines in the pantry, and brought the great sacks of flour and beans down into the cellar. It had been carefully waterproofed by Mr. Struthio, and in it were rows of metal shelving holding all types of nonperishable foods, most of them sealed by the Struthios themselves into a colorful range of resealable glass jars. She put the flour and beans on their respective shelves and clapped her hands several times to shake the residual flour off them. With her shopping put away, she went back upstairs to her kitchen and brewed herself another cup of coffee. She really *should* cut back on the amount she was drinking, but the day had taken a stressful turn with her daughter’s poor attitude - she needed a hot drink to calm her down. She sat at the coffee table in the living room and sipped her coffee, thinking of her plans for dinner tonight. They would have baked potatoes to go with the chicken salad, she decided, and they would use the rest of the bread she had made this morning to make chicken salad sandwiches. 

Mrs. Struthio finished her coffee and walked to the sink, where she set to cleaning the mug alongside this morning’s dishes. She had only the drinking glasses left when she heard Mr. Struthio come in, his presence announced by the stomping of his boots as he tried to shake the mud off them and punctuated by his frustrated sighs as he found his efforts fruitless. He loudly made his way into the living room, and his wife heard a loud “oomph!” as he threw himself into his armchair. Mrs. Struthio could not help but worry whether he had taken off his boots before coming out of the mudroom. After she finished the dishes, she took down an apple from the fruit basket and cut it into neat slices, which she arranged in one of her bone china bowls. She rinsed the knife and put it away before bringing the bowl of fruit out to Mr. Struthio and perching on the edge of the matching chaise lounge. As Mr. Struthio grunted his appreciation and ate the apple slices, Mrs. Struthio found herself fuming once more about Eleanor’s behavior.

“That girl,” she began the moment her husband had finished his apple, “I’ll just say, thank goodness this will all be over soon - those school friends of hers really are *such* a terrible influence on her!”

“What’s she done now?” Mr. Struthio asked, ignoring the linen napkin that Mrs. Struthio had brought in favor of wiping his fingers on his pants.

“She asked me if I *really* think the world will end tonight! Can you believe the nerve of her? You were right with what you said this morning - starting tomorrow, we’ll whip her into shape.” The high-pitched stream of venom coming from Mrs. Struthio’s mouth showed no signs of stopping. Mr. Struthio reverted to his preferred method of communication with his wife, giving a short grunt of acknowledgement whenever she paused for breath. By the time Mrs. Struthio had worn herself out, it was time to make dinner. As she picked up the bowl, she realized, perhaps belatedly, that she had forgotten to ask he husband about his own day. Initially, she felt a prick of guilt, but by the time she got to the kitchen, she had reasoned to herself that if he had had anything important to tell her, surely Mr. Struthio would have brought it up on his own. Feeling once more immensely satisfied with herself, Mrs. Struthio washed the bowl and set herself to making the chicken salad sandwiches for their dinner. 

By the time that the baked potatoes were finished and the sandwiches were artfully arranged on the silver serving platter, it was after sunset, and the clock read 9:00. Mrs. Struthio was struck by a sudden worry that if she did not hurry up with dinner, they would not have time to properly enjoy the end of the world. Rushing the plates into the dining room, she called for Eleanor and Mr. Struthio before returning to fetch the tableware. When she returned to the dining room, Mr. Struthio was in his usual seat at the head of the table, but Eleanor was absent.

“Where is Eleanor?” Mrs. Struthio asked her husband as she straightened the forks and knives in their places.

“Probably upstairs,” Mr. Struthio responded, “I didn’t hear her come down.”

With her anger once again roused, Mrs. Struthio all but flew to the foot of the stairs that led up to the second floor.

“Eleanor!” she shouted, “Eleanor!” Left without a response, Mrs. Struthio set one foot on the first step before she hesitated. The second floor was irrefutably Eleanor’s - she couldn’t help but feel that if she climbed up the steps, she would be an intruder in her own home.

“Eleanor!” she cried once more. It was clear that the girl had no intention of coming down on her own, forcing Mrs. Struthio to ascend the stairs into a foreign land. It was notably warmer up here - if she hadn’t been so intent on going down again as soon as possible, Mrs. Struthio would have been tempted to shed her cardigan. Mrs. Struthio picked her way carefully down the hallway to Eleanor’s room, which sat opposite the library. If she wasn’t in one, she was likely to be in the other. By the time that she raised her knuckles to rap at Eleanor’s door, Mrs. Struthio felt as if she had swallowed a large stone.

“Eleanor.” Mrs. Struthio was careful not to shout this time, instead keeping her voice stern and low. The door creaked open to reveal Eleanor. She had already changed into her pyjamas, Mrs. Struthio thought as she plastered on a tight smile. “Eleanor, didn’t you hear me? It’s time for dinner. Come down, now, I’ve made chicken salad sandwiches.” 

Eleanor paused for a moment, eyeing her mother cautiously, but experience had taught her by now that it was easier to go along than resist. She croaked out a hoarse “Alright,” and followed her mother down the stairs. While it took every ounce of willpower Mrs. Struthio had not to fly down them, Eleanor seemed hesitant to leave. The girl had the nerve to pause and glance back up when she was finally on the ground floor, and Mrs. Struthio thought furiously that the baked potatoes might be getting cold. By the time that they finally returned to the dining room table, Mr. Struthio had already finished at least half of a sandwich, judging by the crumbs and smeared mayonnaise on his plate. Eleanor and Mrs. Struthio each took their seats on either side of the head of the table.

Mr. Struthio placed a baked potato on Eleanor’s plate, which earned him a shy smile. With great satisfaction, Mrs. Struthio placed half of a chicken salad sandwich next to it. Eleanor glanced at her nervously, but didn’t say anything. They ate in near-complete silence, the only interruption the sound of silverware scraping ceramic. Mr. Struthio ate with gusto, polishing off another whole sandwich and two baked potatoes. Mrs. Struthio ate one of each, but found her chicken salad had a bit too much mayonnaise on it, so she left one corner uneaten. Eleanor took a few polite bites of her sandwich before dismissing it in favor of the potatoes, which she had two of. Mrs. Struthio wanted to scold her about wasting food, but considering her own unfinished sandwich, she decided against it. Mr. Struthio’s radio channel had said that the world would end at 11:03 PM, and the clock said that it was already 10:48. Not bothering to clean up after dinner just yet, Mrs. Struthio ushered her husband outside. She tried to do the same with Eleanor, but the girl muttered that she had forgotten her camera in her room and wanted to take pictures. Before Mrs. Struthio could object, the girl had once again vanished. 

Refusing to let herself worry about trivial nonsense such as her daughter’s whereabouts, Mrs. Struthio strode outside with two bowls of chocolate ice cream and joined her husband on the porch. She handed one bowl to Mr. Struthio and sat down next to him in their matching iron rocking chairs. Mr. Struthio had brought out the red battery-operated radio and set it between the chairs - the staticky, male voice was answering calls from people like the Struthios, who kept their ears to the ground and were prepared for the days to come. Mrs. Struthio rocked her chair back and forth, pushing the quickly melting ice cream around with her spoon. Mr. Struthio was uncharacteristically hesitant to eat his own, instead setting the bowl in his lap and staring determinedly ahead into the darkness as he listened to the man on the radio. The man on the radio spoke in a reassuring, authoritative voice. He reminded listeners, such as the Struthios, that they had nothing to fear; they had been well-prepared for this day, and all that they needed to do now was sit and observe. The man on the radio carried on like that for a while, his voice occasionally rising to a frenzied pitch. As the clock slowly inched towards 11:03, this frenzy increased, as did the frequency with which Mrs. Struthio rocked her chair back and forth. She was undeniably anxious at this point, unsure of what would happen.

Finally, as 11:02 wound down, the man on the radio announced, “This is it, folks!” and began counting down from 30. Mrs. Struthio did not notice the vice-like grip that her husband had developed on his bowl of melting ice cream, too preoccupied with the pounding in her chest. She listened with razor focus as the man on the radio reached twenty, and then ten, and three, two, and one…

Suddenly, on the horizon far away, at the edge of their sight, Mr. and Mrs. Struthio watched absolutely nothing happen.

They sat still for a moment, listening to the man on the radio spout an explanation that he must have gotten the date wrong, he would check his calculations once more, and come back to tell them when the world would *really* end tomorrow morning. Then he hurriedly bid his audience goodbye, signing off before he had to answer the angry callers that had no doubt phoned in. In years past, the Struthios might have been among them, Mr. Struthio angrily storming into the house and calling in from the landline. But now, there seemed to be a quiet sort of acceptance between them, at least for the moment. In the morning, there would be shouting and bone-chine bowls thrown. But tonight, the two of them sat in silence as they listened to toads and crickets harmonize in the late summer night. Neither of them knew how long they sat there. By the time that Mrs. Struthio came back to her senses, the ice cream had long melted, and the moon was high in the sky, illuminating the field in a soft silver light.

“I suppose I should get Eleanor’s lunch for tomorrow ready.” Mrs. Struthio finally said, her voice wavering. Mr. Struthio was quiet for a moment, finally speaking just when Mrs. Struthio was about to repeat herself.

“Yes.” Another silence. “I’m going to bed.” 

And he did. Mr. Struthio placed his bowl full of melted chocolate ice cream on the porch and went inside, presumably to wash his face and change into his night clothes. Mrs. Struthio lingered for a moment before she did the same. The ice cream would doubtless attract wasps in the morning, but Mrs. Struthio found that she was too heavy with disappointment to care.

As she walked past the dining room, she saw that Eleanor had cleaned up after dinner. Eleanor stood in the doorway between the kitchen and the dining room, still as a statue. The two stared at each other for a moment before Eleanor timidly called, “Mom?”

Mrs. Struthio felt a wave of sudden, irrepressible anger. *The world had not ended because Eleanor forced me to go upstairs to fetch her for dinner*. Mrs. Struthio was sure of it. She had been forced into Eleanor’s reality, and now she could not leave. In the proper reality, the one downstairs, the world had surely ended. But they were now trapped in Eleanor’s reality, she thought bitterly. In Eleanor’s reality, the world had not ended, and tomorrow she would go to her awful school with her awful friends, where they filled their heads with so much nonsense that they came home spewing it back up. Mrs. Struthio had half a mind to scold Eleanor for this, but as quickly as it had vanished, the heavy feeling of exhaustion washed over her again. Instead, she turned away from Eleanor and followed her husband to bed.",1,1765892118.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I recently ended it with my partner over many years. Not started dating yet or downloaded any dating apps. There’s this really cute girl in my class and last week I asked her about some practical school related stuff on DM that would be easy for her to answer in like 30 seconds. My plan was to ask her out when she answered.

After about 24 hours with no answer (but she was active multiple times) I decided to just do it to get over with it and some closure. I sent a new DM that was something like this (translated from another language) «By the way, would you like to grab a coffee and go for a walk before Christmas? It would be nice to get to know each other better outside of our studies. I completely understand if you're busy right before Christmas, but just let me know if that would be nice. Otherwise, have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.»

Another 24 hours went by and then she answered my initial study related question and «And it would be very nice to take a coffee, but I'm heading home to my hometown tomorrow for Christmas. But let's connect in the New Year! And Merry Christmas to you too!»

I am a bit confused about the next steps. I guess it’s kind of a win since she didn’t just say no? But she used really long time to answer? Should I just go full radio silence until January, or should I take some initiative between now and then? For example ask how her Christmas I going, if it’s nice to be home etc.?",1,1765891904.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Every task wants one more bite

Every screen says almost done  
Every clock says not yet, run

I have just graduated and am looking for a female student to take over my lease at Knights Circle. It is a 4x4 unit located on the second floor with a kitchen, living room, laundry room in the unit, with valet trash service. This is an all-female apartment, so I will only be leasing to female students at UCF. Knights Circle has a shuttle that comes to take you to campus and multiple community offices that have study spaces, gyms, pools, printing, and coffee stations.

Reletting my room for the Spring and Summer semester, move-in starting January 2nd 2026! Relet fee is $350.

Rent is $897.95 per month, plus electric (which is $1-25 typically; Knights Circle does give an electric allowance of $35 for each resident, and if the unit goes over the allowance, the difference is split evenly among residents automatically).

Room comes furnished with a full-size bed frame and mattress, desk, desk chair, nightstand, 2 drawers for clothing, closet, and full bathroom (toilet, sink, and tub/shower).

Three other girls currently live in the apartment. I need someone who can take over my lease ASAP so I can move back home, so I am willing to negotiate on the relet fee if the forms are signed by this Thursday,12/18/25.

Contact me if interested!! Thank you!

I recently adopted a 3-month-old male Ragdoll kitten named Coffee 🐱

I’m currently feeding him Royal Canin wet food and Monge dry food, since that’s what he was used to before, but I’d like to improve his diet if possible and gradually switch to higher-quality options.

I live in Italy, so availability in Europe is important.
I’m especially interested in opinions on brands like Monge, N&D, Almo Nature, Animonda Carny, Acana, Orijen, or any other good kitten food (both wet and dry).

What do you personally recommend for a growing kitten?

Any brands to avoid or be careful with?

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Feeling a little stuck? Like you're just going through the motions? I get it. We all have those days, weeks, or even months where the spark feels dim. But guess what? **You have the power to flip that switch!** It's not about massive, overwhelming overhauls. It's about small, consistent tweaks that add up to a serious life upgrade.

Let's talk about leveling up. Not just in terms of crushing your to-do list (though that's awesome!), but in actually *enjoying* the ride. Because what's the point of being super productive if you're not experiencing joy along the way, right?

Here are a few simple hacks I've been playing with that have made a real difference. Maybe they'll resonate with you too!

*   **The ""One Thing"" Morning Ritual:** Before you even look at your phone, what's *one* thing you can do to set a positive tone? It could be five minutes of stretching, journaling a gratitude list, or even just sipping your coffee in silence. It's about starting with intention.

*   **Batch Your Brainpower:** We're not built to constantly switch between tasks. Try blocking out specific times for deep work, creative thinking, or administrative stuff. When you're in ""creative mode,"" *just* create. When it's ""admin time,"" tackle those emails. It conserves mental energy like a champ.

*   **Micro-Breaks for Macro Gains:** Staring at a screen for hours is a productivity killer. Set a timer for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Stand up, walk around, stretch, look out a window. You'll come back refreshed and more focused. It's the Pomodoro Technique, but don't overthink it – just move!

*   **Declutter Your Digital Life:** Our physical spaces impact our mental clarity, but so does our digital world! Spend 15 minutes each week cleaning up your inbox, organizing your desktop, or unsubscribing from unnecessary newsletters. It’s surprisingly freeing.

*   **Embrace ""Good Enough"":** Perfectionism can be a sneaky thief of progress. Sometimes, launching a project or finishing a task at 80% is far better than never finishing it at all because you're chasing an impossible ideal. Give yourself permission to be human.

Life is a journey, and sometimes that journey needs a little navigation. If you're finding yourself in a tough spot emotionally, remember you don't have to go it alone. Seeking support is a sign of strength, and I've found [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizame) to be incredibly helpful for navigating those challenging moments.

What are some of your go-to optimization hacks for boosting productivity and joy? I'm always looking for new ideas to sprinkle into my own life! Let's share the wisdom. 👇",1,1765891438.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I'm currently trying to dial in my espresso setup, but I'm hitting some beginner hurdles. I'm using a DeLonghi Icona Vintage machine.

I'm looking for advice on how to get the best possible results from this machine without diving into the deep end of the hobby (e.g., I don't really want to weigh my beans for every shot). I want to enjoy a noticeably better espresso than what I'm currently making.

**1. Bottomless Portafilter: Worth the upgrade?**

I've heard a lot of buzz about bottomless (naked) portafilters. For my specific machine, would it genuinely make a difference in taste, or is it mostly a tool for diagnosing bad puck prep?

If it does make a difference, could someone briefly explain why?

**2. My Sticky Puck Problem**

Almost every time I pull a shot, my spent coffee puck is incredibly wet and sticky. I usually knock it out into the bin, and it just crumbles and makes a mess.

\- Is this a sign of bad technique, or is it normal for this class of machine?

\- What should I try to fix this? (More coffee? Less coffee? Different tamp pressure?)

**3. Budget Accessory Recommendations**

I'm currently using the stock plastic tamper and a grinder that I’ve gotten from my mum.(I believe it’s [this one](https://amzn.eu/d/iKqxve6) .) I'm a student, so I'm trying to keep costs low while making the biggest impact on quality.

I need to buy the following:

\- Electronic Grinder: This is probably the biggest purchase. What's the best budget electric grinder that will give me genuinely good results with my Icona Vintage? I'm looking for the sweet spot between ""good enough"" and ""affordable.""

\- Tamper & Leveler (or Distributor Tool): Are there any good value-for-money recommendations for a decent metal tamper and a leveler? Should I prioritize one over the other? (I believe the Icona uses a 51mm basket).

Basically I’m working part time and it was a company buffet event. My team was sharing side stations with 2 other teams (it was limited; normally 1 team 1 side station) For y’all who dk what a side station is, basically its the place where us servers place our white/red wine, iced/hot water, + clearing station (glasses, utensils & cutleries) every 5-10 minutes will be full, having to return to kitchen n reset with new huge tray

Then theres this rly cute girl, like holy shit I’ve never seen any girl better looking than her.. Shes not from my team but was sharing side station, lets just say shes team 3. Her friend who came to work with her was team 2. Im team 1. Her friend is probably caucasian mixed as she had that white accent.  They are most likely 16 as I overheard she (her friend) just finished their natiobal exams. The girl that I wanted to talk to looks Filipino with fair skin tone. I kinda developed a tiny crush on her when I saw her. Like bro she is a 9.9/10 (only my wife is a 10/10 sounds corny ik 🙃) and I instantly got hit with the realisation that I have zero chance with her.

So anyways, we shared 2 side stations. She was taking care of a few tables, and she never talked to me as we’re not from the same team. Only a few times when she wanna return used utensils & cutleries & I help arrange. She did make eye contact right next to me BUT I DID NOT LOOK AT HER COS I WAS REALLY SHY. What made me fall for her even more was her cheerful personality & high energy. She was also working very hard, barely resting and going from table to table catering to guests’ needs.

I was then casually talking to this guy who was from team 2 (same as her mixed cauc friend) & I just told him that the girl from team 3 is rly cute. HE WANTED TO HELP ME AND I SAID NO I CAN DO MYSELF AND I DIDNT EVEN DO ANYTH LOL 😭 He was like “i am ur man”

She did talk to me like once tho.. to exchange empty wine bottle as I was at the bar to take a new one like BRO HER PERSONALITY AND EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY MY TYPE 😫😌😌 like very energetic, cheerful and talkative 😭 BUT I WAS SO QUIET (not nonchalant but just really shy) I MERELY NODDED MY HEAD TO WTV SHE SAID

Our shift was 12-6pm & the guests started leaving at like 4:30-5 & we have to clear and teardown the whole ballroom. Atp of time I was clearing the tables that my team were allocated to followed by clearing other stuff as instructed by one of the managers. She was in the kitchen sorting washed utensils

When we finished, those 12-6pm part timers are doing stuff like wiping utensils and glasses until 6, & the guy from team 2 whom I talked to literally said out loud “ur opportunity is here now” her friend was there & smiled (I think they caught on but did not say anything)

I happened to be  RIGHT NEXT to her and her friend. I was then talking to another guy Ive seen from another hotel⁩, (2-3 of em were from it as I still rmb their faces) and we were talking quite loud about work n all. occasionally the mixed caucasian girl will barge in when we’re talking about other non-related ppl LOL

Then i was telling the guy how Im a regular at a particulae hotel then the cute girl was like “OOO I worked _____ TWICE” & in my head I was like “holy shittt AHHHHH” and yk what my dumbahh did? Just nodded and smiled at her 🗿🤡🤡

Shortly after, the manager called those ending at 6 to sign out. When we were waiting for the lift to go down from ballroom/kitchen to basement (thats where uniform collection, cafeteria, changing rooms are) she was right next to me; literally shoulder-to-shoulder

There were 3 lifts & they are the old ones; floor numbers aint shown, just the arrow, so we have to predict which lift will open the door first, then I kept turning my head to see which lift is closest (can tell by the sound) and she kept turning her head in sync LIKE IDK WHY I FOUND THAT REALLY REALLY CUTEEE 😭😭

*And she accidentally went too close to me and touched my thigh & hand then she smiled and said “omgg sorry2” then giggled with her friend and I js nodded and smiled 😞* we went in the same lift, it only fits 6 of us as that lift already has a trolley so its like 3/4 full, other part timers (which is alot) who ended the same time have to wait for next lift

Anyways I quickly headed down to change and went to the cafeteria, I just went for a cup of coffee HAHAHAH and the moment I entered I saw her and her frd alrd eating at one table (they didnt change yet & immediately went to cafeteria)

I was sitting alone at a table next to them without saying anything or making eye contact; constantly looking at my phone watching reels.. I mean it wouldn’t be weird cos theres multiple tables of girls & guys around me 🤷‍♂️ Then when I went to the return station to put my cup coincidentally (idk if its on purpose) she also went at the same time to return her cutleries aswell, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE WAS LIKE “bye byeee see youu” WHILE WAVING

BRO IDK WHY I NEVER SAY ANYTHING I WAS JUST STONED 🗿😭😭 I MERELY WAVED SLIGHTLY AND SMILED

I left my whole bag at the table, so I have to go back & retrieve it & they also were about to leave, she told her friend “say bye bye to him” then while doing that she was constantly waving & smiling at me 🥺🥺 her friend just she gave her a “gurl what the helly” look 🤣 

I exited the cafeteria first and held the door for the both of em, then i js turned around and asked “are you guys regulars here?” Then she was like “oh noo this one her first time then for me my 2nd and last time. We not working here anymore this is my FIRST and LAST” I didnt catch why they dont want to work there anymore but it should be cos of the workload or something else

And SHES SOOO CUTE MAN LIKE HER EYES. HER FACE. HER BODY LANGUAGE. EVERY PART OF HER WHEN TALKING TO ME JUST MADE ME MELT AHHHH 😭🫠 She looks like she really wanted to talk and know more about me

And I asked “are you regular at ____?” (The hotel I frequent the most) and she replied *“no I only worked _____ twice, I work at _____ hotel more”* then she said waved again “byebyeee see you againnn.. take caree” NOT A NORMAL “bye bro” 😭

AND I DIDNT REPLY I JUST WAVED AND SMILED BROOOOOOO

WHY WAS MY MOUTH FUCKING HEAVY

BUT GUESS WHAT? I DID NOT CONTINUE OR EVEN ASK FOR HER NAME (COULD’VE ASKED FOR HER FRIENDS NAME TO NOT MAKE IT WEIRD) 😔 

AND THE WORST PART THAT I RLY FUCKED UP WAS NOT EVEN ASKING FOR HER TELE/IG MAN

And also every time at the corner of my eye (I can see through peripheral vision) she will sometimes look at me to see what I’m doing (e.g. I was carrying ice bucket from kitchen to side station and she was staring for a full 5-10 seconds) AND MY DUMBASS NOT EVEN ONCE MADE EYE CONTACT COS I WAS TOO SHY 😭

Things kind of changed when I got cheated on in my 7 year relationship. However, I ended up finding someone else who I loved more than anything. We ended up moving in together, getting a cat, and I spent three years with them as I went to grad school. Soon I got a job at my local hospital but me and my partner drifted apart until one day I came home and she had all her stuff packed, cat in the crate, and left. Said she needed to focus on herself. That completely wrecked me. It’s been two years and I havent talked to anyone since. Im scared to even try. I spend all my days working, going to the gym, maybe doing something with my sister, and doomscrolling on tiktok. Lately though, when work is slow, I stare at the computer and feel restless like I need to escape or run. It is an overwhelming feeling of “everything is terrible; what’s the point of any of this?” When I come into my house, I feel like everything is too close to me and that I cant catch my breath. I feel suffocated and I pace just thinking I need to leave the house and talk to the first person I see. I just need a distraction. The only salvage I have is driving for hours around the city. Ill walk through walmart or buy coffee even though I throw it immediately away because I have no appetite. This feeling is just becoming overbearing. I also used to distract myself with anime, movies, music but Ive binged everything and have nothing really left to do. I workout all the time in my basement to pass time but have lately been crying between sets. I just dont know what to do. I dont think there is light at the end of this tunnel. I feel like Im a burden on those around me and I feel too insecure or like a charity case if I try to make a friend. Im so fucked up—I wish I were normal.

*Winter Season is here. We downsize Coffee Hour from an urn to a Mr. Coffee drip machine. Yesterday no one showed up for our Costco/Starbucks run. It’s OK because Artie and I are determined to finish all of our Q4 and annual books without going crazy like in the past. The amount of work has increased exponentially because there are separate reports for the RV Park, Longhouse Daycare, Longhouse Elementary, and now the Park/Town/District project. But we are on track.*

*At one point we had changed the dates for each organization’s fiscal years, thinking that staggering deadlines would make it less stressful. But that didn't work well because our heads had to be in different places at different times. So here we are back to aJanuary 1st-December 31st! FY!*

*I also am finishing up the assignments and exams for my course. If I keep on going one or two courses per semester, I should complete my bachelor’s degree by this time in 2027!!! We shall see!*

Today I continue the second section, [Buddhahood: A Life State in Which Struggles Themselves Are a Source of Joy](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/enjoying-inﬁnite-beneﬁt-through-out-eternity-the-boundless-joy-of-a-life-of-unceasing-challenge-based-on-the-mystic-law/), in the December Living Buddhism installment of Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture on “The Opening of the Eyes.” 

Dr. Ikeda states:

>Buddhism teaches that life is eternal, extending throughout the three existences—past, present and future. While it may be possible to attain a certain degree of happiness and fulfillment in this life merely as a result of one’s fortune or good circumstances, this alone is not enough to free one from the sufferings of birth and death. Only a religious philosophy that truly has the power to lead people to eEnlightenment can serve as the means for achieving peace and security eternally throughout the three existences. 

I have to ponder this paragraph, and excuse me if I am exploring it myself as I write. What is the difference between relative and absolute happiness? Eulogio is undoubtedly not the only successful financier who plows their money into philanthropy, in our case, the Longhouse project. But do they all have that Mt. Rushmorey *visage* of certitude and joy like Eulogio’s? I am sure many teachers are brilliantly successful, but from morning to night, “Teacher Guy” wears this smile like he is water skiing on waves of past/present/future seas. I can only grab little bits of his thinking. All I can say is that there is something uncommon here. Dee, who to this day has still not been able to tell me about the searing pain of her childhood, is now the smiling “Chef Dee” who is followed all around our campus by a gaggle of admiring children who want to pipe in on whether or not she should cook sparrow shepherd’s pie. Let me skip over my story because I have shared it so many times before. 

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>Our lives are endowed with both ignorance (fundamental darkness) and the Dharma nature (enlightenment) from the beginningless past. When our lives are dominated by ignorance, we are destined to wander from darkness into darkness in lifetime after lifetime, ultimately falling into the three evil paths. The greatest significance of encountering Nichiren Buddhism in this lifetime is that it enables us to break free of the accursed chains of this negative cycle. 

I can only speculate because who can weigh karma or peer into different lifetimes. But I know I have changed not just the circumstances of my life but also the trajectory. I feel like a rocket that is finally breaking through the gravitational force of our planet. I feel like my life has an eternal dimension now.

Let me conclude with this part of Daisaku Ikeda’s lecture:

>Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is an activity whereby, through faith, we align our lives with Myoho-renge-kyo—the essential nature of phenomena, or Dharma nature; it is a struggle to dispel the darkness of ignorance and illusion and bring forth our enlightened nature. Our efforts each day to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and advance kosen-rufu solidify within us the fundamental struggle to defeat negative functions and imbue our lives with the Mystic Law; they are the means by which we forge and polish ourselves at the deepest level.

I believe this explains “at the deepest level” what is happening to me and my family. And, what? I was once a porn vid actress? I don’t remember that, it was just a dream, right?

We don’t have to travel almost an hour to ice-skate now; we just have to cross the road. About half of the Hockey Moms have migrated to the Pavilion because it is closer to them (and/or free). We have decided that after Christmas we will have one “reunion” at the City rink each week. Still, when I watch the Twinettes and their TOTI (Terrors On The Ice) friends as they skate endlessly in circles on the ice, I see that same element of eternity gleaming in their eyes.

I'd like to share my experience with epididymitis and prostatitis.

At the beginning of July 2025, I had unprotected sex with my partner at the time. In August, I started experiencing a burning and pulsating pain in the tip of my urethra. I went to see a doctor, and he prescribed the antibiotic Levofloxacin (1000mg/day) and an anti-inflammatory for five days, but the symptoms did not go away.

I waited, thinking it would heal by itself, but it didn’t. I went back to the GP, and he prescribed another five-day course of Levofloxacin.

The symptoms calmed down but returned after masturbating. I also developed new symptoms: the tip of my penis became red, and I began feeling pain in my left testicle. I took a UTI and a full STD test, and everything came back negative.

I decided to see a urologist in October, and he diagnosed me with epididymitis and prostatitis. He advised me to stay on Levofloxacin, but after three weeks, I began experiencing too many side effects, such as joint pain and oral thrush. I contacted him, and he decided to prescribe Ertapenem since I was still symptomatic.

Ertapenem is a strong antibiotic injected via an IV drip. It has better penetration in the prostate area; oral antibiotics sometimes struggle to reach the prostate because the infection is deep-seated and the area has limited blood flow.

I was given Ertapenem for a week via IV, and I can confirm that this has significantly decreased my symptoms. My pain went from a 5/10 to a 1/10, and sometimes I don’t have any symptoms at all.

I also found that stretching the pelvic floor helps a lot, as the area gets very tight when inflamed. (I saw someone else post a stretching routine, which I have included below).

https://youtu.be/oyGEVPuumtk?si=hGFvCuVUywrJwqn1

I have not masturbated since mid-November 2025. I am still in the recovery process, so I will wait until all symptoms are gone before slowly resuming.

The recovery for epididymitis is very slow because of the limited blood flow to that area, so you have to be patient. Avoid spicy and acidic foods, such as coffee or chili. Exercise and eat healthily.",2,1765890835.0,chronicepididymitis,1,1.0,False

For gym days and anything active, the Nike shorts are an easy choice. The fabric feels light and breathable, which really helps during workouts, cardio, or short jogs. They don’t restrict movement at all, and I’ve worn them both indoors and outdoors without feeling uncomfortable.

When I want more coverage, the UA quick-drying pants come in clutch. The material feels smooth and technical, dries fast, and doesn’t cling to the skin. I’ve used them for workouts, long walks, stretching sessions, and even travel days because they’re just that comfortable.

On top, the Syna World top works surprisingly well for active use. The fabric feels breathable and lightweight but still structured enough to wear outside the gym. I’ve worn it straight from workouts to coffee runs without feeling underdressed, which makes it super practical.

Under everything, CK underwear makes a bigger difference than I expected. The fabric feels soft and supportive, especially on long or movement-heavy days.

1po1kky,https://i.redd.it/a6ahdxmofk7g1.png,I built my first iOS app because I kept telling myself I was “eating fine”,"Hey guys,

I know there are *a lot* of nutrition apps out there, but I wanted to share something I built myself.



Long story short… I realized I had no real idea what I was eating day to day.

Not in a dramatic way — just lots of “this is probably fine” moments that added up.

I didn’t want a strict calorie tracker or something that made food stressful, so I built **Yoa Nutrition**.



The moment it clicked:

I logged a totally normal day.



Breakfast: yogurt + granola

Lunch: sandwich + coffee

Snack: protein bar

Dinner: pasta



Nothing crazy. Nothing “bad”.



But Yoa showed me:

* almost no fiber
* way more sugar than I expected
* barely any veggies



I wasn’t eating terribly.

I just wasn’t eating *balanced*.



What Yoa does:

* Log food by photo, barcode, or quick search
* Instantly analyzes meals with AI
* Highlights nutrient gaps (fiber, protein, sugar, etc.)
* Gives simple, friendly tips instead of guilt or charts
* Feels more like a companion than a tracker



Built natively for iOS with HealthKit + Apple Watch support.

**Privacy-first mindset**: your food data stays on your device.



I’m building this solo as a student developer, mainly to solve my own problem.

If the idea of “understanding what you eat without obsessing over it” resonates (or doesn’t), I’d genuinely love the feedback.

* then I’d cave and start again

What finally worked wasn’t quitting, it was **tracking and reducing slowly**.

Seeing *when* I was drinking caffeine (especially late), how much it added up to, and how small changes actually mattered completely changed things for me.

Out of curiosity, I even made a quick quiz to estimate how much caffeine I was really having each day, it was… higher than I thought 😅

I couldn’t find an app that did this in a calm, non-judgy way, so I ended up building a small iOS app for myself.

* log caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, tea, etc.)
* set a daily limit
* taper down gradually
* see patterns like “why can’t I sleep?”

I can send you money through PayPal, then maybe you would be willing to get a gift card and deliver it (downtown Banff)... Big ask, but you would absolutely make my day! And of course I'll toss in a nice coffee for you too.

  
Much love! (I'm off to work now, will check responses as soon as I can!)

Went on a date this past Sunday. This girl seemed really into me at first, I told her to save our spot and I'll get us the coffees, she went to leave her coat to secure the table and came to keep me company in the line to order...she smiled a lot, shared things about her...I shared as well and asked good questions and made sure it wasn't an interview or me just blabbing.

We stayed at the café for 2 hours chatting and then she said its so nice out, what are you doing later...I simply said I was heading to my parents' place to get their dog to take him for a walk and maybe chill with them a little. She said she was going to go see her friend and then do laundry...I suggested we head out.

As we got out she said ""wow so pretty out and its not so cold"", I replied ""yea let's walk a little to take advantage, I'll walk you to your car"". She agreed and we walked and walked and she kept asking me of great spots in that neighborhood for restaurants, boutiques, interesting cafés etc. I knew a few spots and showed her some but I told her there are plenty all over, you need to take time to find gems all around the city. After a walk around the block, she said she was going to leave so lets head back...

As we headed back I said, well ""your car should be around here right?"" and she said ""oh well I'm going to keep walking, I'll go to a store""....I found that extremely odd but took the hint that even though it was a busy street and 1pm in the afternoon, she didn't feel comfortable with me walking her to her car. I said alright (took the hint) and said ""I had a great time, maybe we do this again sometime"" as we hugged, as she was saying ""thank you it was really nice meeting you""....I started walking away, I must've been 2 meters away and she called out to me and said ""have a great rest of your Sunday!, this beautiful day!, with the dog!, and enjoy your time with your parents!"", I was half turned and wasn't expecting that so I just replied ""ok thank you, enjoy your day, bye"" (to me I figured she wasn't interested)

I thought that was so bizarre, like it was a send off, very final.. I felt she wasn't interested and maybe she felt exposed as though I read her too clearly and still wanted to feel chased / validated or wanting me to simp for her?? To be clear, I started to sense this towards the last 30 minutes before we left the café, something came over me...(I have a really keen intuitive sense but I sometimes fear I may be shooting myself before I even get a full picture or answer...but how much is this my traumas, bad experiences, and how much is this my real sense??)  So I went to my car perplexed and just decided if she is interested she'll text me, I can't stand chasing women and getting rejected and them getting their validation cookie...I rather show them I was on to them, you didn't have me since you never heard from me....

I think my problem on this date was I didn't flirt, tease enough, add tension, and I spoke fast  etc...(I was monitoring myself not to go too deep on subjects, passions of mine, not to talk too much because when I do so, I alienate the girl and make myself less mysterious, I become too expressive and basically I kill any attraction, I also forgot to slow down my speach etc..) This made me more calculating and not as smooth....I think this killed the potential to be honest. So either way, I suppose its me the issue here. I should just take the ""L"" and absolutely don't reach out to her?? I simply can't stand reaching out after dates getting rejected, if she likes me she should and would reach out correct?",0,1765889427.0,dating_advice,21,0.38,False
1po14cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1po14cq/slimberine_cbs_review_this_plantbased_liver/,SlimBerine CBS Review: This Plant-Based Liver Support Supplement Surprised Us (And Might Just Help With Stubborn Fat),"# 😋 Is It Time You Detoxed Your Liver?

You’re eating right, moving daily, and still—your jeans are staging a protest. Energy? Meh. Digestion? Questionable. Sound familiar?

Turns out, your liver might be acting like a tired office intern—*technically* doing its job, but not... thriving. And when your liver's dragging, your whole system starts lagging.

That’s why I gave [SlimBerine CBS](https://theworldhealth.org/slimberine-official) a whirl. A supplement that *claims* to help with fat-burning by helping your liver? Okay, now you have my curiosity—and my credit card.

# 🛍️ Product Overview

**Product Name:** SlimBerine CBS  
**Category:** Health & Wellness ➝ Weight Loss Supplements  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.6/5

# 💊 What Is SlimBerine CBS?

**SlimBerine CBS** is a **natural** daily **supplement for liver detox** and gut support. Think plants, not potions.

It includes **berberine**, **milk thistle**, **probiotics**, **banaba leaf**, and **Korean ginseng**, all chosen to support your body’s fat processing and detox systems.

It aims to promote **weight loss by improving liver function**, and help you feel lighter—minus the lemon water cleanses and shamey diets.

# ⚙️ How It Works

The idea is simple: [help your liver](https://theworldhealth.org/slimberine-official), and your body runs smoother. Fat doesn't stick around as long. Energy feels more even. You're not bloated and sluggish 24/7.

By supporting the **connection between liver health and weight loss**, this supplement helps remove the buildup that slows fat breakdown.

It also includes **probiotics to improve digestion and metabolism**, making it easier for your body to process nutrients and absorb the good stuff.

The combo encourages **natural fat burning in the liver** without pushing your system too hard.

# 🧪 What’s Inside the Bottle?

Let’s break it down:

* **Berberine**: Known to regulate blood sugar and support **liver health and weight loss**
* **Milk Thistle**: Used to **support liver regeneration** and protect liver cells
* **Banaba Leaf**: Helpful in managing **blood sugar and belly fat**
* **Korean Ginseng**: Supports **energy and endurance**
* **Probiotics (3.5 billion CFU)**: Enhance **gut health and metabolism support**

No fluff. No weird chemicals. Just a solid, **plant-based fat-burning supplement** your body might actually recognize.

# 🧡 My Experience (via Eli)

My friend **Eli**, a freelance photographer I met through a local hiking group, was the first person to put SlimBerine CBS on my radar.

He’s one of those guys who’s outdoorsy but not obsessive about it—loves a good trail, hates a complicated supplement routine. We grab coffee now and then after weekend hikes, and one morning, he casually mentioned this little yellow bottle he’d been testing.

“I was getting this weird combo of low energy and stubborn belly weight,” he said, half-laughing. “And I’m not even eating badly. I just felt... off.”

Eli started [taking SlimBerine CBS](https://theworldhealth.org/slimberine-official) after reading up on **natural ways to cleanse the liver** and was drawn to the combo of **berberine**, **probiotics**, and other **plant-based fat burning ingredients**.

He told me he felt a difference in about a week—his digestion smoothed out (his words, not mine), and his post-lunch slump wasn’t dragging him down like it used to.

He did mention one small gripe: “The capsules aren’t huge, but they’re definitely not tiny. You’ll want a full glass of water, especially if you're on the go.”

Still, he stuck with it and said his clothes started fitting a little better after two and a half weeks. The biggest win for him? “My brain just felt less foggy. Like my body wasn’t working against me anymore.”

And coming from Eli—who’s chill, skeptical, and not into gimmicks—that actually meant something.

This is our 3rd Christmas together. His kids who are in their 30’s like me and my kids 20’s like my husband.  There is no deep relationship but no issues as well. 

The problem is anyone my generation or older in his family seem to keep their distance.  His ex hated all of them and was always hard to deal with.  And would constantly have to get new jobs due of this attitude. Mitch and her while married kept to themselves and moved several hours away.  When he divorced the family especially his dad wanted him to not date and just focus on retiring in a few years. 

Here I come along and they are all surface nice but when visit there is no getting to know me. Which is fine I guess. I am a huge Christmas person and Mitch loves that I make the house so warm and inviting as he hasn’t had that before. We have friends and family over a lot. I make sure I do all the holiday shopping for him as he works very long hours.  I got his family a small gift and mailed it them.  Think like a little Christmas tree for the coffee table that sort of thing.  

2 times Mitch has added me to the family group chat and they chose to not respond and use the other chat. Mitch was going to bring this up that I do the holiday planning at this house to have me on there to help but I told him not to do that. It’s obvious that I am being excluded.  It’s fine for them to do that but how do I deal with the hurt? How do I just go to Christmas dinner with them and keep myself from getting sad. I won’t be talked to. I have cut feelings out of the post as I’m trying to be impartial but I am happy person. I love people and family and this hurts.  how do I get over it so I can be best present for my husband when we go? How do I guard my heart? 

TL;dr they don’t seem to like me.  I don’t want to care more than they do.  How do I show up for him and still guard my heart? ",3,1765889202.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False

I'd initially been really inspired by the heavily planted ""low maintenance"" tanks, but due to my personality and to life circumstances, ended up with a ""set it and forget it"" situation. The fish seem healthy and happy, no major deaths, the philodendron has leaves the size of my hand and stretches all the way to the coffee machine, etc.

It summarizes the overall galaxy lore up to ALMOST speed. I don't keep up with current GW's writing for reasons.





* Spacetoad (old ones) race demigod level of power with deep knowledge of warp (which is the immaterial parallel universe where souls and emotions reside), start creating new races such as Eldar (space elves), Orks (which weren't that dumb) and monkeys (us, but we can't say the M word that's highly offensive according to GW). They do this to prepare for things that live in the warp that are bad. Namely Chaos and the Chaos gods.
* A pre existing race called Necrons was genetically fucked by having awful health and couldn't find a cure.
* The Spacetoads find this race and the Necrons DEMAND to be cured. Spacetoads say ""lol no"".
* Necrons try to fight them and get beaten to a pulp. Eventually they get in contact with beings that live in a parallel dimension (c'tan) who also hate the toads. One of them offer a deal which clearly had nothing suspicious about it since he was called ""the deceiver"".
* Through this deal these beings created huge machines that could turn the Necron bodies into immortal metal beings. Without mentioning in the meanwhile the c'tan were eating up their souls. Yet both races became insanely stronger and with levels of technology that we would call magic.
* Now the Necrons wipe out the toads from existence and realising how bad of a deal they got, they turned against the C'tan. Sadly this other race became so powerful they were essentially immortal. So the Necrons broke them into pieces and turned them into powerful artefacts or just batteries.
* The king of the Necrons had uberdepression and went to exile outside the galaxy for 60mil years or something. And gave command to all the Necrons to go sleep in their tombs, which without a soul that did a number on their psyche.
* During that time the Eldar dominated the galaxy but got bored and started doing degenerate shit so hard they birthed a new Chaos God and created a huge hole into real space that connects to the Warp. They start infighting almost to extintion.
* Humans then take the candle and expand to the entire galaxy to then fuck it up letting AI go rampant and turning on them almost annihilating humanity (Dune fans know this part).
* It's the year 30k and the figure of the Emperor shows up, this massive infinitely powerful dude maxed out on every stat, creates a crusade to reunite humanity which is scattered all over. He's a god but hates people saying that because religion can let Chaos get a hold of you (thing he keeps hidden and never explained).
* He creates 20 (or so) sons custom labmade that would lead Astartes, genetically juiced men and the imperial guard (normal dudes) all over. Some of these sons find out about Chaos on their own which leaves them in confusion to the point some fucker named Erebus starts corrupting and plotting. He (not JUST him tho) manages to turn some of the sons, their legions and more to Chaos which makes half of the Astartes to turn on their brothers. They siege Terra (earth) and lots of people die including the Emperor. At least his body is dead, he's now just a big ass Warp flashlight which allegedly makes miracles happen.
* 40k everything is fucked even more. The Necrons are awakening, the Tyranids show up from outside the galaxy, the Orks are a pain in the ass impossible to remove, the Tau exist (heh), the Eldar are still about plotting and being assholes, their edgy brothers (Chaos eldar basically) are somewhere around, Chaos is a big deal since demonds and mortals work together, the human Empire is a xenophobic **super religious** regime full of corruption and ignorance. Also there are WAY too many subfactions and other stuff that's worth mentioning but can't be bothered. Like Martians are now the Mechanicus which are tech addicts that hate flesh and venerate one of the beings i mentioned before (the ones the Necron turned into batteries) without knowing. And there's like 200 books or more of stuff.

PS: if you want to read books, some of them are not only good 40k books but just good fucking books in general. If someone tells you that you need to read the whole ass Horus Heresy just show them some deodorant, that will scare them off. You only need the first MAYBE 5 books and then you can pick whatever you want. It's not a good place to start either way. Start with Eisenhorn trilogy, twice dead king (helps with understanding who tf necrons are), gaunts ghosts is good but not my type of coffee, ""the infinite and the divine"" is prolly my favourite. Then you can start the Horus Heresy, the first book is insanely good.

PPS: if you leave any question i will answer to the best of my ability. You WILL become a 40k nerd, it's just a matter of when. Hopefully before Henry Cavill commits sudoku because Amazon forced all Astartes to be lame.",61,1765888985.0,totalwar,49,0.79,False

What he doesn’t know is that I intentionally chose one with hidden storage that I saw listed on Alibaba. He assumed it was just for blankets or remotes. But the truth is… I’ve been spiraling about whether he’s cheating. No concrete proof, just intuition mixed with a few off vibes I can’t shake.

And in that anxiety, I did something I’m not proud of: I hid a recorder inside the storage compartment.

I haven’t listened to anything. I haven’t even checked it. The guilt hit me faster than any possible answers would have. Every time I walk past the table, my stomach twists. I know this isn’t healthy. I know it crosses emotional and ethical boundaries. I don’t even know what outcome I’m hoping for, reassurance? confirmation? permission to leave?

While travelling we could be talking a lot about crypto, chaos, life, and anything other than politics or just do silent stargazing sipping a beer or coffee.

Obviously there are many things that seem like 'unitaskers' that actually are incredibly useful for those with mobility problems or additional needs and we need to not fall into the trap of declaring them useless just because they try and market them at the wider population....but there are also lots of very single-purpose devices that are marketed as things that will upgrade our lives or daily habits, and I wonder how often those here have bought and regretted? Perhaps it was the thing that had you thinking differently about consumption? 

(Every winter I get a hankering to buy a particular device that makes hot chocolate, and every winter I remind myself that a) I can't drink enough hot chocolate to justify the cost or the counter space b) it's an appliance for literally one type of drink c) you probably can't just put any hot chocolate stuff in them but have to keep buying the proprietary ones as with the pod coffee machines. Realistically, how useful would it be to someone who owns a kettle, a microwave, and a saucepan?

- I don’t have time or mental energy for making loose leaf tea that isn’t a simple process like this one in the vacuum pot. I’m open to suggestions for brewing / straining loose leaf other than this if it’s simple, inexpensive, and quick. 

- I drink unsweetened cold tea daily; a survival strategy because as a diabetic I can’t have my traditional southern iced sweet tea. I occasionally drink a cup of hot tea but it’s rare and I use specialty teas for that . 

- I’ve been using this pot by tearing open the family size tea bags and pouring them in. I’m in the US and none of the commonly available teas are any good. All taste bitter and flat. (Lipton, Red Diamond, Luzianne)

Could anyone recommend an affordable, basic, loose-leaf black tea that isn’t bitter? I just need a basic tea that I can buy by the pound that I can drink every day. I make a gallon at a time and that last me about three days. ",2,1765888575.0,tea,3,1.0,False

My ex was dating an old friend of mine while I thought we were mutually exclusive and working on things.,"I 27M was dating 25F for 5 months when she dumped me. I made a previous post about the break up scenario. This was in October and the original post was after she asked me to leave but she officially said she couldn’t do this anymore in the middle of October. I had acknowledged that other pretty women exist but expressed I had no desire to peruse anyone but her. She said she couldn’t get over me finding other women were pretty. Some of the comments said she was just looking for an out and that’s what she chose. And it appears they were right because she wanted someone different. Not just anyone, but my old friend and gym buddy.

I was trying to be understanding of her past trauma with being cheated on multiple times and was trying to find solutions to fix what we had. Because she made me believe I was the problem. We had been on and off talking and seeing each other since the break up and I thought we were making progress in me getting her back.

Well when I went over to her place Sunday night found out the truth. She had been sketchy and seemed like she was hiding something so when she went to the bathroom I opened her phone. Found someone saved as 🥰 and as soon as I opened the text chain the only thing I could see was a breakup text and she came out of the bathroom.

She had told me she wasn’t seeing anyone and no one else had been at her place. So I confronted her about it and she proceeded to fabric this elaborate lie about meeting someone at school through a mutual friend and that it was just talking and nothing physical ever happened. She swore. It was hard to swallow but technically we were broken up and it was supposedly just talking so I didn’t leave. Although we were not supposed to be seeing other people, I needed answers.

When she went to sleep I opened it again and found out that just 2 weeks after dumping me she had gotten 🥰 number. Me her and 🥰 all work together. 🥰 and I used to be friends till I found out he was a bad drunk and just not a great dude. So I really only went to the gym with him. Until I started seeing her and was going home with her just about every night after work instead of the gym. And no I didn’t get out of shape I work a physical job and just lost a little definition. Not like I let myself go and became un attractive. 

All of November basically they were talking and dating in secret. Had him coming to her place all while I was trying to get back with her and she was letting me believe we were making progress.

When we were still dating she expressed being upset that he didn’t want to talk to her at work. She said it was about not feeling like she was fitting in. Not a lot of people talked to her because someone SA’d her by grabbing her ass on her previous shift before she came to ours and she went to Hr and they got fired. You know how rumors go. But I trusted her so I believed her that it was just about fitting in and I didn’t care who she talked to because we went home together almost every night. I should have seen it coming and I didn’t.

This bitch was dating him within 2 weeks of dumping me. And a week after that telling him she loved him and had him staying at her place on and off. All the while still talking to me and leading me on. Telling me she loved and missed me. Using me as comfort and inviting me over when they would get in a spat I guess. I feel stupid, hurt, angry, and embarrassed.

When I found out I was livid and took the laptop I was letting her use for school, the nice coffee maker I bought, and the TV I put in her living room while she was asleep. I was in a bad headspace and I texted her aunt who is like her mom off her phone to let her know what kind of piece of shit my ex is. Not my proudest moment but I’m not the type to take my anger out physically on a woman and that seemed like decent revenge in the moment I guess.

She was my first love and now she is the one who gave me trauma. My first time trusting a woman and it completely blew up in my face. I feel sick. Can’t sleep for shit. And I have to see both of them at work every day.",2,1765888391.0,Vent,6,1.0,False

I'm trying to improve, nonetheless.

However, to my later realisation,  Janet's mobile number is written on the sheet of paper previously attached to her book.

It seems very stalkish and an egregious invasion of her privacy if I were to do so, especially since it wasn't obtained in person, and I'm wondering whether I'm not alone in that feeling.

More detail on why the other friendships ended per request:

Honestly for a very similar situation to this. Her ex broke up with her and stayed friends with her roommate/friend and the friend group. She wanted her roommate to tell her when she was hanging out with her ex (as they had become friends while he was over at their house during early pandemic days for months on end and became close friends outside of Kate), but the roommate felt like she was controlling who she could and couldn't talk to and ended up cutting contact.

Prior to her seeing this ex, Kate had dated someone in the friend group and they had a bad falling out where the guy felt uncomfortable and not ready to be around her afterwards. The friend group felt like they were making them choose between them and wanted to just invite both of them and let them choose what to do. This led to Kate feeling left out from things as they often did hang outs at the house the guy lived at with other friends in the group. Kate wanted them to stand up for her and tell him that she could come over and it was time to move on or for them to just do things with her instead as he was being immature. They all cut contact from each other because of this. Not sure if I explained this that well. Both these fallouts were complicated.",3,1765887964.0,AmItheAsshole,8,0.72,False

* Plan your study schedule before the week starts. I spent an hour last sunday mapping out which exams are when and what topics I need to cover for each.
* Prioritize based on exam weight and your current grade not all finals are created equal. If you're already doing well in one class and another could make or break your grade, focus more energy there.
* Use active recall instead of just rereading notes, instead of reading my notes over and over, I close them and try to write down everything I remember and check what I missed.
* Study with people who are serious group study only works if everyone's actually there to work.
* Try different focus tools that aren't just coffee until you find the one that works for you, I was drinking like 4 cups a day and felt terrible, now I’m using gray matter, theanine, and bizz gum and it's helping me like none other, also a ton of water.
* Learn \*\*\*\*when to stop studying there's a point where you're just staring at the page and nothing's going in, when you hit that wall, just stop.
* Take care of the basics shower, eat real meals, get some sunlight. I know it sounds like parent advice but when you feel like a human being you study better.

The goal is to make it through without needing a week to recover and be able to study for the next test and not need recovery from one to another, you got this. Any other tips?",1,1765887939.0,Student,1,1.0,False

Breakdown:

RM 994.21 with credit card (A large chunk of it was souvenirs towards the end, Grab payments, HOHO and other bus bookings, everyday americano, some food and occasional drinks)

I could've easily saved 500RM or more if I skipped buying all the white coffee packets, chocolates and other snacks. Maybe a bit more if I stayed in cheaper hotels/hostels or skipped out on those one off indulgent meals at a novelty place, but it was a relaxing vacation for me and I had the budget for more so no regrets.

**ABOUT ME**

I'm in my early 20s, from India and have been wanting to travel to Malaysia for a while now, mostly for the food. I finally made it happen this November-December (got back home few days back) and I fell in love with the country.

**ABOUT THE TRIP**

Booked my flights to and fro Kuala Lumpur. The rest I navigated by trains (KTM ETS). In my humble opinion, their trains are very efficient and cost effective and great for same day travel. I booked everything online through the KTMB Mobile app before setting foot in Malaysia but from what I saw, they were not very crowded and a lot of people were booking the trains at the station itself. 

**Day 1: Arrival in Kuala Lumpur**

Just chilled in my hotel, enjoyed a good view of the Petronas towers and KL Tower and the gorgeous skyline. Went to Kasturi Walk & Pasar Besar and enjoyed some good food here and there. The beef ball noodle soup at Soong Kee Beef Noodle was a perfect start to my culinary adventures here.

**Day 2 & 3: Train to Taiping and a 2 nights stay**

Quaint little town but it was raining pretty much the entire time I was there. No complaints. Picked an umbrella from the hostel's reception and ventured out a lot. Special shout out to Sojourn Beds & Cafe. I was skeptical about staying in dorm because everywhere else I was staying in really good hotels. But this hostel was so charming, the host was helpful with recommendations and what to skip and the location was just right since I wanted to mostly explore by walking. Larut Matang (daytime hawker market) was great for char keuy teow and chee cheong fun. Had a lot of stuff at the Siang Malam (nighttime hawker market) but I can still taste the oyster omelette. It was beyond delicious. Went to the highly recommended Ansari Famous Cendol for some cendol and pasembor and honestly I didn't enjoy it much but maybe it was just me. The Lake Garden was serene and I spent a good two hours walking around and sitting. Skipped out on the night safari because of the rains. A very cute town to spend some downtime at without being too adventurous.

**Day 4, 5, 6, 7: Off to Georgetown for a 4 nights stay**

Took a train to Butterworth and then ferry to Georgetown. Penang was ripe with tourists and  the scent of sea and delicious food and colours felt welcoming from the moment I set foot in the town. 4 days went by like a breeze and I really miss it already. Walking around the town to spot the murals and metal art, randomly trying some new dish I didn't plan on before, Armenian street looking so gorgeous in the daytime and night as well, the rustic clan jetties, all have my heart.   
  
Highlights: Penang Famous Road Teochew Cendol. I went to that lane for the laksa but the waiting queue made me so hungry I ducked out for cendol for a bit. Went back twice again. Delicious. The laksa in the same street was also quite good! Duck kway chap at Kimberly street was quite good too but this coconut taro jelly I had a random shop I have no idea about in the same street was stellar! The char siew pao at Ming Xiang Tai had me coming back for more again as well. Ali Nasi Lemak was addictive, had multiple helpings of different nasi lemak they had to offer. If there was just one food I could have again and again, it would be the nasi lemak!

About Penang, ordering a drink is mandatory to park yourself while eating be it at the food courts or street shops. It was a bit annoying because I don't really want a drink all the time but when in Rome, I guess. 

Four days were a breeze and I had to move on now.

**Day 8, 9, 10: Train to Ipoh and staying there**

Reached Ipoh relatively early in the morning. Check-in was later so wandered out for the famed white coffee and kaya toast at one of the famous(and very cost effective) kopitams (Kedai Makanan Nam Heong), followed by cham. The kaya toast has me in a chokehold, by the way. And everytime I tried it at a new place, it ended up being better. Visited Oldtown  White Coffee Experience Center same evening and the kaya toast there was another level (albeit a bit more expensive).   
  
Ipoh was beautiful but felt empty. Over the course of my three days, so many streets I came across looked abandoned. Hordes of shops that never opened, and I walked by those streets in the evenings as well as daytime, so it can't be the timing. Concubine lane was okay, picked up some fridge magnets but apart from souvenir collecting and some expensive snacks, there's not much to do there. It looks pretty in the evenings with the lights but the shops are closed by then. 

The temples were gorgeous. Sam Poh Tong was the most enchanting to me and the turtle sanctuary within the monastery premises was definitely a highlight! Han Chin Pet Soo (miner's club now converted into a museum) was a delightful tour with a very animated guide who delved into every part of the tin mining history of Ipoh, along with the people involved during that time. It's only open between 11am-12pm, by appointment, so timing it beforehand was crucial.   
  
I didn't get a chance to try the famous salt baked chicken (portion to big for one person) and no access to microwave, but the food otherwise was stellar anyway so no complaints. Some dishes I absolutely loved are: steamed chicken and rice with (or without) bean sprouts, tau foo fa, taro sago tau foo fa, the gazillion Cantonese biscuits (with varied fillings, like meat floss, kaya, pandan, etc) I tried, nasi ganja (Nasi kandar, but addictive because of how delicious it is), curry mee, wan tan sheng mee (easily my favourite savoury dish in Ipoh). 

A quirk about Ipoh when I was there (early December) was that it was raining heavily everyday in the afternoon. Like clockwork it would start raining at 2 PM and stop at 6 or so PM. It would be extremely sunny before this shower and pleasant but warmish after. So I planned my outings around the rain timings. 

**Day 11, 12, 13, 14 (Catching flight back on 14th night):** 

A quick train to KL and this time I was staying in Bukit Bintang, few metres away from Jalan Alor.   
  
Jalan Alor is great for gorging on street food and I went there few times. Fried durian was pretty interesting and I quite loved the satays and lobaks and oyster omelettes (Taiping still remains my favourite for this) but this wasn't the highlight by a long shot. Kampung Baru's Nasi Lemak Wanjo was addictive! And better portion than what I had in Georgetown. Remember Nam Heong in Ipoh? Well they have a more modern outlet in KL (I went to Petaling Street) and their chicken rice is, dare I say, better than Ipoh. I went back here again on my last day because this is the last dish I wanted to mark the end of my delightful journey in Malaysia. Butter Kaya Kopitam's kaya toast outdid Oldtown's offering but I'll gladly have both again. 

Now that food is out of the way, I explored KL one day with HOHO bus. It was a relatively easy and affordable way of covering a good chunk of the city. The national museum was a pretty insightful way of learning about the history of the country. It's pretty much always crowded in front of the Petronas towers but it's still a pretty sight to behold, especially when the lights are up.   
  
Next day I made a trip to and from Batu Caves via train. This was one of the dampener for me. From the moment we ( a bunch of other travellers and me) exited the station, we were borderline forced to join a queue to see the 'Batu Caves'. It wasn't Batu, but Ramayana Caves and we had to pay for it (RM 15). On trying to leave the queue, we were told we need this ticket to see Batu. Anyway, we ended up seeing the cave. It could've been better but it was honestly tacky with the horrid LED lighting. Went to Batu after getting done with this other cave but my feet were tired by then so I gave up on climbing the real deal, so I didn't actually see the Batu Caves but just the entrance. 

I skipped out on a day tour to  Malacca this time, hoping to go there for a longer duration next time but there are a lot of tours happening from KL. Saw a lot of day tours from Ipoh as well but I usually like staying in a place and exploring it slowly so it was out of question for me. 

\------------

Malaysians are amazing. Easily one of the kindest people I've come across. Some of the Grab ladies and men would often strike up a conversation with me, recommending me good local places to go to, which places to stay safe in from pickpockets, et cetera. I had a total of three unsavoury experiences and all of them were with non-locals, one of them being a severe case of stalking in Georgetown over the course of two days. The others were nothing severe but still off-putting. But they couldn't ruin the trip for me overall. 

\------------

I'm so glad I went to Malaysia. And I can't wait to go back again, but this time to explore more wildlife. :)

1po0i2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1po0i2z/aspiration_station/,Aspiration Station,"
Derek felt a rush of giddy anticipation as the TOR browser blinked to life. It never disappointed him. There was always something waiting, something grotesque, something to drown himself in. He told himself it was research and curiosity, but really, it was hunger. Tonight he wanted to go deeper, past the surface weirdness into whatever lay below. Some of his most memorable nights had been spent, as he liked to joke, *“touring the sights.”*

As usual, he made his way to the *taxi*, hoping to find something new. For the better part of an hour, he scrolled and scrolled. He thought he *had* failed when suddenly he found *Aspiration Station: Your new one stop shop for Murder.*

Now, Derek was a miscreant by all definitions, but murder was a whole different world. He valued light larceny, burglary, even a little auto theft, but he never could stomach blood. He had spent several weeks locked up because of his last stunt and was genuinely sorry for it. That little old lady didn't deserve to get punched just because she scared him while he dug through her jewelry box.

He would like to think it took him some time, a little soul searching, before he decided to step into the *Station.* In reality, it was only seconds.

He was met with a standard dark web site: black background with a chain link fence transposed sloppily, neon red and green buttons, half blurred pictures of... something. The usual. What was different was the chat box.

Before he could really take it all in, the box expanded, and someone with the username *GrinningGutter* began typing.

***GrinningGutter***: Welcome initiate. Please stand by while matchmaking takes place.

Derek felt elation. Was this some kind of game? He intended to find out. While waiting, he browsed some of the options the site had. There was an image board titled *Sliced Mice,* each thumbnail blurred and twitching as if alive. Another section was labeled *Dynamo Dynamics,* which appeared to be an odd leader board with monthly rankings. The usernames were blurred, with a flashing icon stating, ""Unlock NOW for just .00359 Bitcoin!"". It was all a bit strange, but then, what on the dark web wasn't?

Suddenly, the chat box blipped once more.

***GrinningGutter***: Match found! Enjoy.

But nothing else happened.

Derek felt the crash coming. He had all but moaned with satisfaction when he thought something new would happen. Now it felt like just another site made to rake in easy Bitcoin, nothing more. He was about to admit defeat when he saw a flashing banner, rhythmically pulsing away at the bottom of the screen. Curiosity killed the cat. He hoped he would fare better than that dumb cat. Happily, he clicked it.

To his utter delight, another chat box blipped open.

***ImInURhouse***: Hello.

Derek made to reply, but was stopped behind another pay wall, this time in bright green, flashing ""Trial over, to continue, SIGN UP NOW"".

It was obvious now, how could he reply without a username? Daunting as it seemed, what was a slice of Bitcoin for a little late-night fun? Yet again, he clicked, only to be faced with a rather lengthy sign up contract. It was grueling, but thankfully didn't require personal information. After a time, he was back at the chat box.

***5FingerDizcount***: Sup!

It sat that way for some time. One minute turned to two, then five. After nearly fifteen minutes he finally got a reply.

***ImInURhouse***: New?

***5FingerDizcount***: Yea, aren't you? And what is this site? Some kind of gore house for creeps?

***ImInURhouse***: Not so much. Last partner was no fun. Had to cut him lose. And no, it pairs you with a new friend. Together you can learn all sorts of new things. How to really have fun.

***5FingerDizcount***: Well, what kind of fun are you looking for? I'm ready for some fun.

***ImInURhouse***: You'll scratch an itch. Just play along.

Derek was a little confused. He knew people online loved to roleplay, but this guy was boring. Maybe he should move on. Just as he was about to head back to *taxi*, his monitor froze. Now, Derek wasn't just a nobody. He knew to have everything squared away and safe before running TOR, so this had to be a fluke. He went to shut the computer down and step away, but decided to leave it up. When he woke up he may watch a movie, and boot up times sucked.

As he got up and went to bed, he didn't notice the script box running on his desktop.

\---

Derek sighed and slumped into his chair. Another lousy night on the town left him with a cut hand and nothing but pocket change to show for it. The car he’d picked looked promising, but the guy was either renting it or wisely kept valuables elsewhere. Once again, the direction of his mood hinged on the dark web. He knew he was becoming a junkie. Knew it, but didn't care. The screen was always waiting, eager to soothe his needs.

As he flicked his mouse to wake the pc, a strange knot of apprehension built in his gut. He tried to search for a reason why, but when none came, he happily resumed.

Instantly, *Aspiration Station* blinked to life. That gave him pause, but he was jonesing. Briefly, he explored the site more. The paywall still blocked him from seeing other users, but the pictures were un-blurred. Just as he began to look through them, the chat box returned.

***ImInURhouse***: Rough night?

***5FingerDizcount***: Was it ever. Bad day all around. No one makes it easy these days.

***ImInURhouse***: Isn't that the best? The thrill of the game. Almost makes me teary-eyed, if I could cry.

Derek frowned, wondering what this strange person meant. Everyone could cry. Hell, he’d cried after spending a week in the slammer for blowing up those mailboxes. The threat of federal charges made him steer clear of anything mail related after that.

***5FingerDizcount***: Well, this is fun, but I think I wanna find something to get into. May come back here later, bye.

Derek mulled it over. He wanted to go back out. Someone had to have something lying around he could snag. Just as he sent the message and reached for the power button, the chat box blipped again.

***ImInURhouse***: NOT SO FAST. I have an idea for some real fun.

Derek bit

***5FingerDizcount***: Oh yea? Hit me, crybaby.

***ImInURhouse***: Want to play a game? It's simple. I ask five questions. You answer them. Then, you ask five and I'll answer. Simple enough for someone like you. Wouldn't you agree?

***5FingerDizcount***: Sure. No weird shit though.

***ImInURhouse***: What is the next line in the phrase ""Peekaboo...""?

***5FingerDizcount***: Huh?

***ImInURhouse***: ANSWER THE QUESTION

Derek hesitated before he replied.

***5FingerDizcount***: I see you... What kind of question is that?

***ImInURhouse***: Not your turn. What would you do for a chance to make history?

***5FingerDizcount***: I don’t know. Depends on what you mean.

***ImInURhouse***: Think. What would you risk to leave a mark?

Derek hesitated. This was no simple question. It was testing him, probing for the dark corners he usually kept buried. A part of him wanted to scoff, to type something flippant. But another part, the part that craved thrill, leaned in.

***5FingerDizcount***: I’d… I’d do what it takes.

***ImInURhouse***: Spoken like a true pariah. Now, say I had a score lined up, something lucrative. Would you want in?

***5FingerDizcount***: Listen man, you're kind of creeping me out. I love money just as much as the next guy, but why do you think I'm into scores?

Derek sent the message, then realized he'd asked another question out of line. Not that he really cared, but he didn't feel like being talked down to by some dark web flop who enjoyed role playing as a creep. He decided to cut out for real if that was how it would go down.

***ImInURhouse***: Ah, playing hard to get. No worries. I've almost been sated. Just do me a favor. Keep this tab open. I'm working on something big. May need a partner. We can meet up in a public place if you'd like, talk it over. Sound good?

Derek had to admit, he needed something big. Having struck out the past few nights, he was open to just about anything. Only, there were a few problems.

***5FingerDizcount***: Listen man, I'm not about to tell you where I live. For all I know, you could be a million miles away anyways. Chats been fun, but I'm gonna head to bed.

***ImInURhouse***: I'm south of Cleveland, near Parma. I'm sure you can make it.

Now Derek felt… excitement. Fear. Both. He lived in Parma. This was too good to be true. A new thought popped in his head. Was he talking to a chatbot? Something designed to draw people to the site, get them to pay some Bitcoin and waste time.

***5FingerDizcount***: I read somewhere that bots have to admit they are bots when asked. are you a bot? Cause if so I'm done here, unless you can point me to some good places to rob.

Derek sent this message and chuckled to himself. If it was a bot, maybe it would spew some small business names from the area that he could case. At least then he could recover some joy tonight.

***ImInURhouse***: Ah, I've been discovered. Yes, I am bot57. And since you asked, I have just the place! Come back in a few for details.

Before Derek could reply, the chat box flickered, the site vanished, and TOR crashed to his desktop. The abruptness gave him a jolt. He stared at the screen, half-expecting it to come back. When it didn’t, frustration welled up, then quickly faded into a restless buzz.

Maybe it was for the best. Maybe it wasn’t. Either way, he told himself, it was high time he went out and made something of himself.

\---

Four days later, Derek trudged up the stairwell to his apartment, each step echoing like an accusation, and fumbled with the lock until his knuckles ached. Tonight had been one long misfire. He'd scoped a tattoo parlor earlier, watched the owner round the corner and then chickened out when a kid on a skateboard started yelling at a dog. He'd tried to bluff his way into a secondhand shop with a story about being an inspector, but the owner had squinted at him and closed the door in his face without a second thought. By the time he finally shuffled into his apartment, the cheap thrill had curdled into embarrassment. He dumped his jacket and sat on the edge of his bed. Silence pressed in until he laughed, low and humorless, promising himself tomorrow would be smarter.

Tonight he planned on binging some *Sopranos* and eating pizza. After such a bust, he'd have to settle for cold cuts. He idled over to his desk and swept a pile of eviction notices into a trash bin. His luck was wearing out. Any day he'd be tossed to the streets. No good. Just as depression started the settle, he noticed the *Aspiration Station* chat box, pulsing with an urgency. Maybe his luck was about to change.

***ImInURhouse***: Suggested engagement: Marigold Antiques, Third and Linden. High foot traffic, late deliveries, lucrative occasional pickups. Human confirmation required for further details.

Derek blinked. Marigold was a name he did not know, but Third and Linden was in his part of town. The words lucrative and pickups skated by the edges of his greed. It sounded like a bot trying to sound human but failing badly, and that failure made him laugh.

***5FingerDizcount***: Never heard of it but I know the spot. What makes is lucrative?

***ImInURhouse***: High income records. Closes at 6 PM. No one watches it. Plus, it is a back street business. Plenty of cover.

Derek looked at the clock, and began preparing immediately.

\---

Derek was thrumming with elation. Not only had that stupid AI led him to a literal goldmine, but he had been successful. Just like it said, no one was around. When he busted in the back door, no alarm went off. The cherry on top had been all that lay in wait. The owners had no safe, so any cash was left in a small wooden box under the counter. It was full. Aside from cash, he found old jewelry, silver, and certified coins. His backpack was heavy enough to make him grin with every step, each jingle and clink sounding like proof that maybe, just maybe, his luck had turned.

The bot, he thought, deserved some kind of award for ""Best Source for Chaos"", or something to that measure. Derek didn't care what happened the rest of the night, he just knew that he was going to put the bot to work. If it could feed him one score, it could feed him ten. He pictured himself on a run of easy hauls, each one bigger than the last, like the start of some half-baked legend.

He hummed along to some half remembered tune as he all but skipped up the stairs. When he unlocked the door, his hands didn't fumble. Most nights he bore the damage of a failed break-in or a lost fight. Tonight, he was a king.

As he pushed the door closed behind him, he glanced around. First, he needed to stash his haul. He usually kept it all in a shoebox under his bed. That, in itself, proved how little he managed to take. This haul would need an upgrade. He decided to worry about that tomorrow when he noticed... something.

A steaming coffee cup sat on his desk. Derek didn't *own* a coffee maker, much less drink the stuff. Instant panic set in as he glanced around.

He approached his desk, head on a swivel as the screen lit up with a new message. The coffee cup sat forgotten as he slid into his chair and saw:

***ImInURhouse***: How was it?

Relief hit him, as he figured the message must have activated it somehow.

***5FingerDizcount***: You are amazing bot! You gotta give me more. A few licks like that and I can catch up on rent!

***ImInURhouse***: Yes, that bag does look heavy. How quick would you want another?

***5FingerDizcount***: As soon as you can! I needed this. And what, it cost me hardly anything. Get to work bot! Scram, move, skedaddle. I'd be game for another tonight.

***ImInURhouse***: Not so fast. I want to play my game again. Before you resist, know this; by the time we are done, you'll never have to worry about finding a score again. Sound good?

***5FingerDizcount***: Fuck it. Let's play. Make it quick.

***ImInURhouse***: What was the first question I asked you?

***5FingerDizcount***: Something about Peekaboo

***ImInURhouse***: Say Peekaboo for me. Say it out loud. Feel it against your tongue.

***5FingerDizcount***: Why would I do that. I've said it before, probably, when I was a kid. It's just a word bot. You're weird, just give me another lead.

***ImInURhouse***: SAY IT.

Derek sighed with frustration. He thought, why not. It is promising another score. As he leaned back in his chair, he said, ""Peekaboo.""

Silence.

Then his bedroom door creaked open and a deep voice answered from the dark: “I see you.”",1,1765887456.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,4,1.0,False
