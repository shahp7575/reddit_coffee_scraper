Why would I live here when I can go elsewhere? 

I could play again. It hasn‚Äôt killed me yet. So why not? Just for old times sake. Just say the word. 

Until you do. I‚Äôll just retreat to my secret hideaway. 

Before I see the real you, I have a meltdown. I struggle to breathe and I spend the whole night tossing and turning. Will I see you that day? What version of you am I getting? There‚Äôs always a 50/50 chance of me going home with a bitter smile or having the worst breakdown I‚Äôve had in years. 

But with the false you? The one that lives in my head? Every day is paradise.

You invite me for a cup of a coffee and just talk. You ask me how I‚Äôve been and tell me about your day. You‚Äôre the first to message and go out of your way to talk to me. You treat me like I matter. I‚Äôm not afraid of you. 

It‚Äôs nice. And for a moment, I forget what‚Äôs real and what isn‚Äôt. 

But reality is my enemy. And it always ensures the cruelest snap back. 

I believe most of me is lost. The parts that matter, anyway. I think I killed them all while trying to impress you. 

So in the wake of you. I‚Äôve become nothing. 

But that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll get lost on purpose. I know what I look like. A crazed man on the street, lost in his world.

But my world is a world where I can‚Äôt get hurt. Things go just so like scenes from a show. With just the right amount of sadness and heartache. All made up for with the happiest ending.

My reality is grim. And my futures looking dark and short-lived. 

So forgive me for getting lost in it again. But I‚Äôm not sorry. 

If I had to live in reality or die.

You should just put a bullet in my head. ",1,1734379817.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

WTAF? ,"I'm (58f) sure everyone here can appreciate when I say, ""Thanksgiving with the in-laws was hell!"" We all have our own horror stories. But did anyone else get a handwritten note apologizing for it? 

Thanksgiving dinner. Instead of prayer, the in-laws (ages 50-86)  recited a preconceived list of things they were thankful for. They all repeated the EXACT same list VERBATIM as we went around the table sharing what we were thankful for. The long ass list detailed everyone and everything down to the great-grandson's dog. Verbatim y'all. Verbatim. The list purposely did not include *me*. It included a dog they never even met y'all, but it didn't include me. 

Me, the one who gave them food and supplies during COVID--I drove 4.5 hours one way to give them toilet paper during COVID--y'all. Toilet paper during COVID! Also I'm the one who gives them money to help them make ends meet, the one who drives 4.5 hours one way to help them with their side gigs so they can make a car payment or keep the lights on)...ya, I caught it. It really wasn't hard to catch. üòÜ  It's always been one-way. We've always been there for them. They overspend, and we help anyway we can. They have never once come to see us. Oops I lied--they did come to see us when we put them up in a gorgeous mountainside B&B for our wedding. I digress.
I really don't want this to sound like I'm Veruca Salt. It's not me me me.  I do want y'all to realize I do these things for my husband's family even though I'm literally not allowed to speak more than a sentence without being cut off. So I dont bother talking, I am just there to support my husband. We're never asked how our children or grandchildren are doing--but we get to listen for hours about his sister's family.  There's a list of chores for us to do when we go for a weekend. Any chores that need to be done, we pay for everything. Gutters need cleaning, sure we'll buy you a new ladder and get to that for you. Dishwasher on the fritz? Sure, we'll get you a new one. Washing machine not spinning fully, we have a few days husband can take off so we can come fix it right away. Refrigerator ice maker not working, sure we can come down this weekend and fix that for you. Mind you that our ice maker isn't working, but we made sure theirs does. Our washing machine is acting up, but we'll make do so they don't have to. Then there's this: You're allergic to dogs? Let me bring my husky over and have him jump on the bed you're sleeping in--and not tell you. You don't eat meat? Let me sneak some chicken in the potato casserole and watch you get sick. Then we'll tell you it's okay as you puke on the carpet and offer you a towel to help clean it up. All this time they were clever enough to make it look accidental. I digress.

Husband is trying to gloss it over, but even he heard it this time. The next morning (before I left never to return) I had coffee with them and decided the line had to be redrawn. Because I won't give them the satisfaction, I explained due to the economy and troubling world events, *WE* would no longer be offering support to them such as any kind financial support, food, supplies, or otherwise. I listed some of people they were thankful for and suggested in the future, should they need assistance, they contact them. I wrote about 10 of the names down exactly as they were listed the night before and slid it across the table. The only help we could offer, would be some seeds to help them get started on a garden. From here on out, they're on their own. They turned a little pale. I explained, *WE* would be turning our focus and energy towards our children (two each from prior marriages) and grandchildren. I gave them each a hug and wished then well. I left. 

FIL apologized to my husband, but not me. I told my husband I didn't accept the apology. MIL sent a card with an apology she wrote and FIL signed.  Still not an apology though right? There have been no apologies from the other in-laws for participating in the manipulative attack. 

But hey, it was a handwritten note y'all apologizing if they ""said anything to offend me or hurt my feelings."" It's all just water under the bridge now right?

1hfs5nw,https://i.redd.it/z4n6sre0p97e1.jpeg,cat is eating poop from litter box,"TLDR: My male cat is eating his poop from the litter box, they eat raw and I've added more/new proteins, I feel I'm checking all the boxes and unsure what's missing.

Hey everyone! Looking for some guidance here. My babies are 5 months old (07/12/2024) my grey female Briar Rose and my black male Lucien. 

I started a raw diet Nov 20, 2024, feeding big country raw fare game chicken, salmon, beef. They've been HOOKED from the start, going feral whenever I open the fridge. 

BCR recommend 4 oz raw a day split in two meals. After doing some research i will be switching to red dog blue cat as the ingredients are better and was recommended from the pet store. 

Last week I caught my boy eating out of the litter box, and then it clicked why it felt so clean all the time. He's been eating the poo. There was also a few times I found a small piece of poop on the coffee table, so I'm wondering from that. 

So I started doing up their food. For each meal they get 2 oz raw, half a sardine, a mussel (no shell), goats milk, tsp of pumpkin, sprinkle of nutritional yeast and freeze dried beef liver, every other day I add a quail egg. It's been about 2 days of this. 

Last night I checked the litter box and there was a nice sized poop, good colour, texture. Before they were small, shriveled, and a bit white. I went to clean the box this morning and it was all gone, so I'm thinking he ate it again. It also looks like someone threw up, but ate it. 

I'm at a loss and starting to get worried. He scarfs his food down SO fast I have to lock him up so he doesn't take from his sister, who takes her time. I gave them chicken necks yesterday, and he wouldn't stop growling at his sister, they both had their own and eventually just froze while he growled both holding it but not chewing, I separated them and they were fine. 

 They have a scheduled vet visit this Friday, just wanna see what I can do on my own first as I know it can be pricey. 

We do live in a small one bedroom apartment with huge windows. They have a water fountain they share, cat tree, two litter boxes, boat loads of toys, I keep recycled materials out for them to explore, I let them explore my patio supervised a few times a day. I work from home Tuesday, Thursday, but I am out all day M,W,F. I was seeing someone for 6 months who would come over twice a week, but that ended a week and a half ago. 

Nothing else has changed, no new stressors that I can think of. 

Any advice, insight, nutrition I'm missing would be GREATLY appreciated. 

Sincerely a worried cat mama ‚ù§Ô∏è

Something that reminds me of dried blood and forgotten screams. My fingers trace the faded names, each one a testament to a legacy I never asked for but can never escape.

My name is Ezra Pearce. I am the last.

The morning light filters through the curtains of our modest suburban home, casting long shadows across the worn hardwood floors. Lilith is in the kitchen, her pregnant belly a gentle curve against her pale blue nightgown. She's humming something‚Äîa lullaby, perhaps‚Äîcompletely unaware of the weight of history that pulses through my veins.

I should have told her before we married. Before we conceived our child. But how do you explain a hereditary nightmare that defies rational explanation?

My father, Nathaniel, never spoke directly about the curse. Neither did his father, Jeremiah, or his father before him. It was always in hushed whispers, in sideways glances, in the way older relatives would grow silent when certain names were mentioned. The Pearce family tree was less a record of lineage and more a chronicle of horror.

Each generation lost someone. Always in ways that made local newspapers fall silent, that made police investigations mysteriously go cold, that made even hardened investigators look away and shake their heads.

My great-grandfather, Elias Pearce, was found dismembered in a locked barn, every single bone meticulously separated and arranged in a perfect geometric pattern. No tools were ever found. No explanation ever given.

My grandfather, Magnus Pearce, disappeared entirely during a family camping trip. Search parties found nothing‚Äînot a strand of hair, not a scrap of clothing. Just a small patch of ground where something had clearly happened, the earth scorched in a perfect circle as if something had burned so intensely that it consumed everything around it, leaving only a memory of heat.

My father, Nathaniel? He was discovered in our family's basement, his body contorted into an impossible position, eyes wide open but completely white‚Äîno pupils, no iris, just blank, milky surfaces that seemed to reflect something from another world.

And now, here I am. The last Pearce. With a wife who doesn't know. With a child growing inside her, unaware of the genetic lottery they've already been entered into.

The genealogy book falls open to a page I've memorized a thousand times. A loose photograph slips out‚Äîa family portrait from 1923. My ancestors stare back, their faces rigid and unsmiling. But if you look closely‚Äîand I have, countless times‚Äîthere's something else in their eyes. A knowledge. A terrible, suffocating knowledge.

Lilith calls from the kitchen. ""Breakfast is ready, love.""

I close the book.

The eggs grow cold on my plate. Lilith watches me, her green eyes searching, a furrow of concern creasing her forehead. She knows something's wrong. She's always known how to read the subtle tremors in my silence.

""You're thinking about your family again,"" she says. It's not a question.

I force a smile. ""Just tired.""

But tired isn't the word. Haunted. Terrified. Trapped.

My fingers unconsciously trace a small birthmark on the inside of my wrist‚Äîa strange, intricate pattern that looks less like a natural mark and more like a symbol. A symbol I've never been able to identify, despite years of research. It's been in every Pearce male's family photo, always in the same location, always identical.

Lilith's pregnancy is now in her seventh month. The baby moves constantly, pressing against her skin like something desperate to escape. Sometimes, in the quiet moments before dawn, I've watched those movements and wondered if it's trying to escape something more than the confines of her womb.

The genealogy book remains open on the kitchen counter. I catch Lilith glancing at it, her curiosity barely contained. She knows I'm secretive about my family history. Most of my relatives are dead or disappeared, and the few photographs that remain are locked away in a fireproof safe in my study.

""Tell me about your great-grandfather,"" she says suddenly.

My hand freezes midway to my coffee mug.

""There's nothing to tell,"" I manage.

But that's a lie. There's everything to tell.

Elias Pearce. The first documented instance of our family's... peculiarity. He was a cartographer, always traveling to remote locations, mapping territories no one had ever charted. His journals, the few that survived, spoke of places that didn't exist on any official map. Places with geometries that didn't make sense. Landscapes that seemed to breathe.

The last entry, dated December 17th, 1889, was a series of increasingly frantic sketches. Impossible architectural designs. Symbols that hurt your eyes if you looked at them too long. And at the bottom, in handwriting that grew more erratic with each line:

*They are watching. They have always been watching. The map is not the territory. The territory is alive.*

Those were his final words.

When they found him in that locked barn, his body systematically dismantled like a complex mechanical puzzle, the local sheriff's report read like a fever dream. Bones arranged in perfect mathematical precision. No blood. No signs of struggle. Just... reorganization.

Lilith's hand touches my arm, pulling me back to the present.

""Ezra? Are you listening?""

I realize I've been staring into nothing, my coffee growing cold, the birthmark on my wrist suddenly feeling hot. Burning.

""I'm fine,"" I lie.

But the curse is never fine. The curse is always waiting.

And our child is coming soon.

The ultrasound images are wrong.

Not obviously so. Not in a way that would alarm a typical doctor or technician. But I see it. The subtle asymmetries. The impossible angles. The way the fetus's bones seem to bend in directions that shouldn't be anatomically possible.

Lilith keeps the images pinned to our refrigerator, a proud mother-to-be displaying her first glimpses of our unborn child. Each time I look, I feel something crawl beneath my skin. Something ancient. Something watching.

Dr. Helena Reyes is our obstetrician. She's been nothing but professional, but I've caught her looking at me. Not at Lilith. At me. Her eyes hold a recognition that makes my blood run cold.

""Everything is progressing... normally,"" she said during our last appointment, the pause before ""normally"" hanging in the air like a barely concealed lie.

That night, I pulled out the old family documents again. Tucked between brittle pages of the genealogy book, I found a letter. The paper was so old it crumbled at the edges, but the ink remained sharp. Written by my grandfather Magnus, addressed to no one and everyone:

*The child always comes. The child has always been coming. We are merely vessels. Carriers. The lineage demands its continuation.*

What lineage? Continuation of what?

Lilith sleeps beside me, her breathing deep and even. Her belly rises and falls, the shape beneath her nightgown moving in ways that feel... calculated. Deliberate.

I trace my birthmark again. Under the moonlight streaming through our bedroom window, it looks less like a birthmark and more like a map. A map to nowhere. Or everywhere.

My father Nathaniel's final photographs are stored in a locked drawer in my study. I rarely look at them, but tonight feels different. Something is pulling me toward them. Calling me.

The photographs are strange. Not because of what they show, but because of what they don't show. In each family portrait going back generations, there's a consistent emptiness. A space. Always in the same location. As if something has been deliberately erased. Removed.

But removed before the photograph was even taken.

The baby kicks. Hard.

So hard that Lilith doesn't wake up, but I see her stomach distort. A shape pressing outward. Not like a normal fetal movement. More like something trying to push its way out.

Something trying to escape.

Or something trying to enter.

I close my eyes, but I can still see the map. The territory. The birthmark burning like a brand.

Our child is coming.

And I am terrified of what will arrive.

The old courthouse records sit spread across my desk, a constellation of pain mapped out in faded ink and brittle paper. I've been researching our family history for weeks now, driven by something more than curiosity. Something closer to survival.

Every Pearce male in the last five generations died or disappeared before their 35th birthday. Not a coincidence. Not anymore.

My father Nathaniel. Gone at 34.
My grandfather Magnus. Vanished at 33.
Great-grandfather Elias. Found mutilated at 35.

The pattern is too precise to be random.

I've collected newspaper clippings, court documents, medical records. Not the dramatic, sensational evidence one might expect, but the quiet, bureaucratic trail of destruction. Police reports with missing pages. Coroner's files with critical information redacted. Insurance claims that never quite add up.

Lilith finds me here most nights, surrounded by these documents. She doesn't ask questions anymore. Just brings me coffee, watches me with those green eyes that seem to hold more understanding than she lets on.

""The baby's room is almost ready,"" she says softly, placing a mug beside me.

I look up. The nursery door stands open. Pale yellow walls. Carefully selected furniture. Everything perfect. Too perfect.

""Have you ever wondered,"" I ask, ""why some families seem marked by tragedy?""

She sits down, her pregnancy making the movement careful, calculated. ""Some people are just unlucky.""

But I know it's more than luck. Something runs in our blood. Something that doesn't care about love, or hope, or the carefully constructed life we've built.

The birthmark on my wrist throbs. Not painfully. Just... present. A constant reminder.

I pull out the most disturbing document. A psychological evaluation of my grandfather Magnus, conducted two months before his disappearance. The psychiatrist's notes are clinical, detached:

*Patient exhibits extreme paranoia regarding familial 'curse'. Demonstrates intricate delusion of systematic family destruction. Fixates on biological determinism. Shows no signs of schizophrenia, but persistent ideation of inherited trauma suggests deep-seated psychological mechanisms at play.*

Inherited trauma. The words echo.

What if our family's destruction wasn't supernatural? What if it was something more insidious? A genetic predisposition to self-destruction? A psychological pattern so deeply ingrained that each generation unconsciously recreates the same narrative of loss?

Lilith's hand touches my shoulder. ""Coming to bed?""

I nod, but my mind is elsewhere. Calculating. The baby is due in six weeks. I have six weeks to understand what's happening to our family.

Six weeks to break a cycle that has consumed generations.

Six weeks to save our child.

If I can.

The research consumes me.

I've taken a leave of absence from work, my entire study transformed into a makeshift investigation center. Genetic reports. Psychiatric evaluations. Family medical histories stretching back over a century. Each document another piece of a horrifying puzzle.

Dr. Helena Reyes agrees to meet me privately. She's a geneticist specializing in inherited psychological disorders, recommended by a colleague who knew something was... unusual about my family history.

Her office is sterile. Meticulously organized. Nothing like the chaotic landscape of my own research.

""The Pearce family presents a fascinating case study,"" she says, sliding a manila folder across her desk. ""Generational patterns of self-destructive behavior, early mortality, and what appears to be a consistent psychological profile.""

I lean forward. ""What profile?""

She hesitates. Professional detachment wavering for just a moment.

""Extreme risk-taking behavior. Persistent paranoia. A documented inability to form long-term emotional connections. Each generation seems to unconsciously recreate traumatic family dynamics.""

My grandfather Magnus. My father Nathaniel. Their lives were a series of broken relationships, isolated existences, careers marked by sudden, inexplicable failures. And me? I'd fought against that pattern. Married Lilith. Built a stable life.

Or so I thought.

""There's something else,"" Dr. Reyes continues. ""We've identified a rare genetic mutation. Not something that causes a specific disease, but a variation that affects neural pathways related to threat perception and stress response.""

She shows me a complex genetic map. Chromosomal variations highlighted in clinical blue.

""In simplest terms,"" she explains, ""your family's brain chemistry is fundamentally different. You're neurologically primed for a perpetual state of threat detection. Imagine living with the constant sensation that something terrible is about to happen. Every. Single. Moment.""

I know that feeling intimately.

Lilith is eight and a half months pregnant now. The baby could come any day. And all I can think about is the pattern. The curse. The genetic inheritance that seems to hunt my family like a predator.

That night, I dream.

Not of monsters or supernatural entities. But of a simple, terrifying truth:

What if the real horror is inside us? Coded into our very DNA?

What if our child is already marked?

The contractions started at 3:17 AM.

Lilith's grip on my hand was vice-like, her breathing controlled despite the pain. The hospital room felt smaller with each passing minute, the white walls seeming to close in.

Dr. Reyes was there. Not our usual obstetrician, but the geneticist who had been studying our case. Her presence felt deliberate. Calculated.

""Everything is progressing normally,"" she said. The same phrase she'd used before. But nothing about our family had ever been normal.

Hours passed. The rhythmic beep of monitors. The soft rustle of medical equipment. My mind kept circling back to the research. The genetic markers. The documented family history of destruction.

At 11:42 AM, our son was born.

A healthy cry pierced the sterile hospital air. Normal. Perfectly, wonderfully normal.

Dr. Reyes ran her standard tests. Blood work. Genetic screening. I watched, my entire body tense, waiting for some sign of the curse that had haunted my family for generations.

Nothing.

Weeks turned into months. Our son, Gabriel, grew strong. Healthy. No signs of the psychological fractures that had destroyed my father, my grandfather, our ancestors. No mysterious disappearances. No unexplained tragedies.

I submitted every piece of medical documentation to Dr. Reyes. Comprehensive reports. Psychological evaluations. Each document a testament to Gabriel's complete normalcy.

""The genetic markers,"" I asked her during one of our final consultations, ""the predisposition to self-destruction?""

She looked tired. Professional. ""Sometimes,"" she said, ""breaking a cycle is possible. Not through supernatural intervention. But through understanding. Through choice.""

Lilith found me one night, surrounded by the old family documents. The genealogy book. The newspaper clippings. The medical records that had consumed me for so long.

""Are you ready?"" she asked.

I understood what she meant.

That night, I built a fire in our backyard. Watched the papers curl and burn. The history of destruction. The weight of inherited trauma. Turning to ash.

Gabriel played nearby, laughing. Innocent. Unaware of the darkness I was burning away.

For the first time in generations, a Pearce male would live. Truly live.

The curse was over.

Something that reminds me of dried blood and forgotten screams. My fingers trace the faded names, each one a testament to a legacy I never asked for but can never escape.

My name is Ezra Pearce. I am the last.

The morning light filters through the curtains of our modest suburban home, casting long shadows across the worn hardwood floors. Lilith is in the kitchen, her pregnant belly a gentle curve against her pale blue nightgown. She's humming something‚Äîa lullaby, perhaps‚Äîcompletely unaware of the weight of history that pulses through my veins.

I should have told her before we married. Before we conceived our child. But how do you explain a hereditary nightmare that defies rational explanation?

My father, Nathaniel, never spoke directly about the curse. Neither did his father, Jeremiah, or his father before him. It was always in hushed whispers, in sideways glances, in the way older relatives would grow silent when certain names were mentioned. The Pearce family tree was less a record of lineage and more a chronicle of horror.

Each generation lost someone. Always in ways that made local newspapers fall silent, that made police investigations mysteriously go cold, that made even hardened investigators look away and shake their heads.

My great-grandfather, Elias Pearce, was found dismembered in a locked barn, every single bone meticulously separated and arranged in a perfect geometric pattern. No tools were ever found. No explanation ever given.

My grandfather, Magnus Pearce, disappeared entirely during a family camping trip. Search parties found nothing‚Äînot a strand of hair, not a scrap of clothing. Just a small patch of ground where something had clearly happened, the earth scorched in a perfect circle as if something had burned so intensely that it consumed everything around it, leaving only a memory of heat.

My father, Nathaniel? He was discovered in our family's basement, his body contorted into an impossible position, eyes wide open but completely white‚Äîno pupils, no iris, just blank, milky surfaces that seemed to reflect something from another world.

And now, here I am. The last Pearce. With a wife who doesn't know. With a child growing inside her, unaware of the genetic lottery they've already been entered into.

The genealogy book falls open to a page I've memorized a thousand times. A loose photograph slips out‚Äîa family portrait from 1923. My ancestors stare back, their faces rigid and unsmiling. But if you look closely‚Äîand I have, countless times‚Äîthere's something else in their eyes. A knowledge. A terrible, suffocating knowledge.

Lilith calls from the kitchen. ""Breakfast is ready, love.""

I close the book.

The eggs grow cold on my plate. Lilith watches me, her green eyes searching, a furrow of concern creasing her forehead. She knows something's wrong. She's always known how to read the subtle tremors in my silence.

""You're thinking about your family again,"" she says. It's not a question.

I force a smile. ""Just tired.""

But tired isn't the word. Haunted. Terrified. Trapped.

My fingers unconsciously trace a small birthmark on the inside of my wrist‚Äîa strange, intricate pattern that looks less like a natural mark and more like a symbol. A symbol I've never been able to identify, despite years of research. It's been in every Pearce male's family photo, always in the same location, always identical.

Lilith's pregnancy is now in her seventh month. The baby moves constantly, pressing against her skin like something desperate to escape. Sometimes, in the quiet moments before dawn, I've watched those movements and wondered if it's trying to escape something more than the confines of her womb.

The genealogy book remains open on the kitchen counter. I catch Lilith glancing at it, her curiosity barely contained. She knows I'm secretive about my family history. Most of my relatives are dead or disappeared, and the few photographs that remain are locked away in a fireproof safe in my study.

""Tell me about your great-grandfather,"" she says suddenly.

My hand freezes midway to my coffee mug.

""There's nothing to tell,"" I manage.

But that's a lie. There's everything to tell.

Elias Pearce. The first documented instance of our family's... peculiarity. He was a cartographer, always traveling to remote locations, mapping territories no one had ever charted. His journals, the few that survived, spoke of places that didn't exist on any official map. Places with geometries that didn't make sense. Landscapes that seemed to breathe.

The last entry, dated December 17th, 1889, was a series of increasingly frantic sketches. Impossible architectural designs. Symbols that hurt your eyes if you looked at them too long. And at the bottom, in handwriting that grew more erratic with each line:

*They are watching. They have always been watching. The map is not the territory. The territory is alive.*

Those were his final words.

When they found him in that locked barn, his body systematically dismantled like a complex mechanical puzzle, the local sheriff's report read like a fever dream. Bones arranged in perfect mathematical precision. No blood. No signs of struggle. Just... reorganization.

Lilith's hand touches my arm, pulling me back to the present.

""Ezra? Are you listening?""

I realize I've been staring into nothing, my coffee growing cold, the birthmark on my wrist suddenly feeling hot. Burning.

""I'm fine,"" I lie.

But the curse is never fine. The curse is always waiting.

And our child is coming soon.

The ultrasound images are wrong.

Not obviously so. Not in a way that would alarm a typical doctor or technician. But I see it. The subtle asymmetries. The impossible angles. The way the fetus's bones seem to bend in directions that shouldn't be anatomically possible.

Lilith keeps the images pinned to our refrigerator, a proud mother-to-be displaying her first glimpses of our unborn child. Each time I look, I feel something crawl beneath my skin. Something ancient. Something watching.

Dr. Helena Reyes is our obstetrician. She's been nothing but professional, but I've caught her looking at me. Not at Lilith. At me. Her eyes hold a recognition that makes my blood run cold.

""Everything is progressing... normally,"" she said during our last appointment, the pause before ""normally"" hanging in the air like a barely concealed lie.

That night, I pulled out the old family documents again. Tucked between brittle pages of the genealogy book, I found a letter. The paper was so old it crumbled at the edges, but the ink remained sharp. Written by my grandfather Magnus, addressed to no one and everyone:

*The child always comes. The child has always been coming. We are merely vessels. Carriers. The lineage demands its continuation.*

What lineage? Continuation of what?

Lilith sleeps beside me, her breathing deep and even. Her belly rises and falls, the shape beneath her nightgown moving in ways that feel... calculated. Deliberate.

I trace my birthmark again. Under the moonlight streaming through our bedroom window, it looks less like a birthmark and more like a map. A map to nowhere. Or everywhere.

My father Nathaniel's final photographs are stored in a locked drawer in my study. I rarely look at them, but tonight feels different. Something is pulling me toward them. Calling me.

The photographs are strange. Not because of what they show, but because of what they don't show. In each family portrait going back generations, there's a consistent emptiness. A space. Always in the same location. As if something has been deliberately erased. Removed.

But removed before the photograph was even taken.

The baby kicks. Hard.

So hard that Lilith doesn't wake up, but I see her stomach distort. A shape pressing outward. Not like a normal fetal movement. More like something trying to push its way out.

Something trying to escape.

Or something trying to enter.

I close my eyes, but I can still see the map. The territory. The birthmark burning like a brand.

Our child is coming.

And I am terrified of what will arrive.

The old courthouse records sit spread across my desk, a constellation of pain mapped out in faded ink and brittle paper. I've been researching our family history for weeks now, driven by something more than curiosity. Something closer to survival.

Every Pearce male in the last five generations died or disappeared before their 35th birthday. Not a coincidence. Not anymore.

My father Nathaniel. Gone at 34.
My grandfather Magnus. Vanished at 33.
Great-grandfather Elias. Found mutilated at 35.

The pattern is too precise to be random.

I've collected newspaper clippings, court documents, medical records. Not the dramatic, sensational evidence one might expect, but the quiet, bureaucratic trail of destruction. Police reports with missing pages. Coroner's files with critical information redacted. Insurance claims that never quite add up.

Lilith finds me here most nights, surrounded by these documents. She doesn't ask questions anymore. Just brings me coffee, watches me with those green eyes that seem to hold more understanding than she lets on.

""The baby's room is almost ready,"" she says softly, placing a mug beside me.

I look up. The nursery door stands open. Pale yellow walls. Carefully selected furniture. Everything perfect. Too perfect.

""Have you ever wondered,"" I ask, ""why some families seem marked by tragedy?""

The contractions started at 3:17 AM.

Lilith's grip on my hand was vice-like, her breathing controlled despite the pain. The hospital room felt smaller with each passing minute, the white walls seeming to close in.

Dr. Reyes was there. Not our usual obstetrician, but the geneticist who had been studying our case. Her presence felt deliberate. Calculated.

""Everything is progressing normally,"" she said. The same phrase she'd used before. But nothing about our family had ever been normal.

Hours passed. The rhythmic beep of monitors. The soft rustle of medical equipment. My mind kept circling back to the research. The genetic markers. The documented family history of destruction.

At 11:42 AM, our son was born.

A healthy cry pierced the sterile hospital air. Normal. Perfectly, wonderfully normal.

Dr. Reyes ran her standard tests. Blood work. Genetic screening. I watched, my entire body tense, waiting for some sign of the curse that had haunted my family for generations.

Nothing.

Weeks turned into months. Our son, Gabriel, grew strong. Healthy. No signs of the psychological fractures that had destroyed my father, my grandfather, our ancestors. No mysterious disappearances. No unexplained tragedies.

I submitted every piece of medical documentation to Dr. Reyes. Comprehensive reports. Psychological evaluations. Each document a testament to Gabriel's complete normalcy.

""The genetic markers,"" I asked her during one of our final consultations, ""the predisposition to self-destruction?""

She looked tired. Professional. ""Sometimes,"" she said, ""breaking a cycle is possible. Not through supernatural intervention. But through understanding. Through choice.""

Lilith found me one night, surrounded by the old family documents. The genealogy book. The newspaper clippings. The medical records that had consumed me for so long.

""Are you ready?"" she asked.

I understood what she meant.

That night, I built a fire in our backyard. Watched the papers curl and burn. The history of destruction. The weight of inherited trauma. Turning to ash.

Gabriel played nearby, laughing. Innocent. Unaware of the darkness I was burning away.

For the first time in generations, a Pearce male would live. Truly live.

The curse was over.

Something that reminds me of dried blood and forgotten screams. My fingers trace the faded names, each one a testament to a legacy I never asked for but can never escape.

My name is Ezra Pearce. I am the last.

The morning light filters through the curtains of our modest suburban home, casting long shadows across the worn hardwood floors. Lilith is in the kitchen, her pregnant belly a gentle curve against her pale blue nightgown. She's humming something‚Äîa lullaby, perhaps‚Äîcompletely unaware of the weight of history that pulses through my veins.

I should have told her before we married. Before we conceived our child. But how do you explain a hereditary nightmare that defies rational explanation?

My father, Nathaniel, never spoke directly about the curse. Neither did his father, Jeremiah, or his father before him. It was always in hushed whispers, in sideways glances, in the way older relatives would grow silent when certain names were mentioned. The Pearce family tree was less a record of lineage and more a chronicle of horror.

Each generation lost someone. Always in ways that made local newspapers fall silent, that made police investigations mysteriously go cold, that made even hardened investigators look away and shake their heads.

My great-grandfather, Elias Pearce, was found dismembered in a locked barn, every single bone meticulously separated and arranged in a perfect geometric pattern. No tools were ever found. No explanation ever given.

My grandfather, Magnus Pearce, disappeared entirely during a family camping trip. Search parties found nothing‚Äînot a strand of hair, not a scrap of clothing. Just a small patch of ground where something had clearly happened, the earth scorched in a perfect circle as if something had burned so intensely that it consumed everything around it, leaving only a memory of heat.

My father, Nathaniel? He was discovered in our family's basement, his body contorted into an impossible position, eyes wide open but completely white‚Äîno pupils, no iris, just blank, milky surfaces that seemed to reflect something from another world.

And now, here I am. The last Pearce. With a wife who doesn't know. With a child growing inside her, unaware of the genetic lottery they've already been entered into.

The genealogy book falls open to a page I've memorized a thousand times. A loose photograph slips out‚Äîa family portrait from 1923. My ancestors stare back, their faces rigid and unsmiling. But if you look closely‚Äîand I have, countless times‚Äîthere's something else in their eyes. A knowledge. A terrible, suffocating knowledge.

Lilith calls from the kitchen. ""Breakfast is ready, love.""

I close the book.

The eggs grow cold on my plate. Lilith watches me, her green eyes searching, a furrow of concern creasing her forehead. She knows something's wrong. She's always known how to read the subtle tremors in my silence.

""You're thinking about your family again,"" she says. It's not a question.

I force a smile. ""Just tired.""

But tired isn't the word. Haunted. Terrified. Trapped.

My fingers unconsciously trace a small birthmark on the inside of my wrist‚Äîa strange, intricate pattern that looks less like a natural mark and more like a symbol. A symbol I've never been able to identify, despite years of research. It's been in every Pearce male's family photo, always in the same location, always identical.

Lilith's pregnancy is now in her seventh month. The baby moves constantly, pressing against her skin like something desperate to escape. Sometimes, in the quiet moments before dawn, I've watched those movements and wondered if it's trying to escape something more than the confines of her womb.

The genealogy book remains open on the kitchen counter. I catch Lilith glancing at it, her curiosity barely contained. She knows I'm secretive about my family history. Most of my relatives are dead or disappeared, and the few photographs that remain are locked away in a fireproof safe in my study.

""Tell me about your great-grandfather,"" she says suddenly.

My hand freezes midway to my coffee mug.

""There's nothing to tell,"" I manage.

But that's a lie. There's everything to tell.

Elias Pearce. The first documented instance of our family's... peculiarity. He was a cartographer, always traveling to remote locations, mapping territories no one had ever charted. His journals, the few that survived, spoke of places that didn't exist on any official map. Places with geometries that didn't make sense. Landscapes that seemed to breathe.

The last entry, dated December 17th, 1889, was a series of increasingly frantic sketches. Impossible architectural designs. Symbols that hurt your eyes if you looked at them too long. And at the bottom, in handwriting that grew more erratic with each line:

*They are watching. They have always been watching. The map is not the territory. The territory is alive.*

Those were his final words.

When they found him in that locked barn, his body systematically dismantled like a complex mechanical puzzle, the local sheriff's report read like a fever dream. Bones arranged in perfect mathematical precision. No blood. No signs of struggle. Just... reorganization.

Lilith's hand touches my arm, pulling me back to the present.

""Ezra? Are you listening?""

I realize I've been staring into nothing, my coffee growing cold, the birthmark on my wrist suddenly feeling hot. Burning.

""I'm fine,"" I lie.

But the curse is never fine. The curse is always waiting.

And our child is coming soon.

The ultrasound images are wrong.

Not obviously so. Not in a way that would alarm a typical doctor or technician. But I see it. The subtle asymmetries. The impossible angles. The way the fetus's bones seem to bend in directions that shouldn't be anatomically possible.

Lilith keeps the images pinned to our refrigerator, a proud mother-to-be displaying her first glimpses of our unborn child. Each time I look, I feel something crawl beneath my skin. Something ancient. Something watching.

Dr. Helena Reyes is our obstetrician. She's been nothing but professional, but I've caught her looking at me. Not at Lilith. At me. Her eyes hold a recognition that makes my blood run cold.

""Everything is progressing... normally,"" she said during our last appointment, the pause before ""normally"" hanging in the air like a barely concealed lie.

That night, I pulled out the old family documents again. Tucked between brittle pages of the genealogy book, I found a letter. The paper was so old it crumbled at the edges, but the ink remained sharp. Written by my grandfather Magnus, addressed to no one and everyone:

*The child always comes. The child has always been coming. We are merely vessels. Carriers. The lineage demands its continuation.*

What lineage? Continuation of what?

Lilith sleeps beside me, her breathing deep and even. Her belly rises and falls, the shape beneath her nightgown moving in ways that feel... calculated. Deliberate.

I trace my birthmark again. Under the moonlight streaming through our bedroom window, it looks less like a birthmark and more like a map. A map to nowhere. Or everywhere.

My father Nathaniel's final photographs are stored in a locked drawer in my study. I rarely look at them, but tonight feels different. Something is pulling me toward them. Calling me.

The photographs are strange. Not because of what they show, but because of what they don't show. In each family portrait going back generations, there's a consistent emptiness. A space. Always in the same location. As if something has been deliberately erased. Removed.

But removed before the photograph was even taken.

The baby kicks. Hard.

So hard that Lilith doesn't wake up, but I see her stomach distort. A shape pressing outward. Not like a normal fetal movement. More like something trying to push its way out.

Something trying to escape.

Or something trying to enter.

I close my eyes, but I can still see the map. The territory. The birthmark burning like a brand.

Our child is coming.

And I am terrified of what will arrive.

The old courthouse records sit spread across my desk, a constellation of pain mapped out in faded ink and brittle paper. I've been researching our family history for weeks now, driven by something more than curiosity. Something closer to survival.

Every Pearce male in the last five generations died or disappeared before their 35th birthday. Not a coincidence. Not anymore.

My father Nathaniel. Gone at 34.
My grandfather Magnus. Vanished at 33.
Great-grandfather Elias. Found mutilated at 35.

The pattern is too precise to be random.

I've collected newspaper clippings, court documents, medical records. Not the dramatic, sensational evidence one might expect, but the quiet, bureaucratic trail of destruction. Police reports with missing pages. Coroner's files with critical information redacted. Insurance claims that never quite add up.

Lilith finds me here most nights, surrounded by these documents. She doesn't ask questions anymore. Just brings me coffee, watches me with those green eyes that seem to hold more understanding than she lets on.

""The baby's room is almost ready,"" she says softly, placing a mug beside me.

I look up. The nursery door stands open. Pale yellow walls. Carefully selected furniture. Everything perfect. Too perfect.

""Have you ever wondered,"" I ask, ""why some families seem marked by tragedy?""

She sits down, her pregnancy making the movement careful, calculated. ""Some people are just unlucky.""

But I know it's more than luck. Something runs in our blood. Something that doesn't care about love, or hope, or the carefully constructed life we've built.

The birthmark on my wrist throbs. Not painfully. Just... present. A constant reminder.

I pull out the most disturbing document. A psychological evaluation of my grandfather Magnus, conducted two months before his disappearance. The psychiatrist's notes are clinical, detached:

*Patient exhibits extreme paranoia regarding familial 'curse'. Demonstrates intricate delusion of systematic family destruction. Fixates on biological determinism. Shows no signs of schizophrenia, but persistent ideation of inherited trauma suggests deep-seated psychological mechanisms at play.*

Inherited trauma. The words echo.

What if our family's destruction wasn't supernatural? What if it was something more insidious? A genetic predisposition to self-destruction? A psychological pattern so deeply ingrained that each generation unconsciously recreates the same narrative of loss?

Lilith's hand touches my shoulder. ""Coming to bed?""

I nod, but my mind is elsewhere. Calculating. The baby is due in six weeks. I have six weeks to understand what's happening to our family.

Six weeks to break a cycle that has consumed generations.

Six weeks to save our child.

If I can.

The research consumes me.

I've taken a leave of absence from work, my entire study transformed into a makeshift investigation center. Genetic reports. Psychiatric evaluations. Family medical histories stretching back over a century. Each document another piece of a horrifying puzzle.

Dr. Helena Reyes agrees to meet me privately. She's a geneticist specializing in inherited psychological disorders, recommended by a colleague who knew something was... unusual about my family history.

Her office is sterile. Meticulously organized. Nothing like the chaotic landscape of my own research.

""The Pearce family presents a fascinating case study,"" she says, sliding a manila folder across her desk. ""Generational patterns of self-destructive behavior, early mortality, and what appears to be a consistent psychological profile.""

I lean forward. ""What profile?""

She hesitates. Professional detachment wavering for just a moment.

""Extreme risk-taking behavior. Persistent paranoia. A documented inability to form long-term emotional connections. Each generation seems to unconsciously recreate traumatic family dynamics.""

My grandfather Magnus. My father Nathaniel. Their lives were a series of broken relationships, isolated existences, careers marked by sudden, inexplicable failures. And me? I'd fought against that pattern. Married Lilith. Built a stable life.

Or so I thought.

""There's something else,"" Dr. Reyes continues. ""We've identified a rare genetic mutation. Not something that causes a specific disease, but a variation that affects neural pathways related to threat perception and stress response.""

She shows me a complex genetic map. Chromosomal variations highlighted in clinical blue.

""In simplest terms,"" she explains, ""your family's brain chemistry is fundamentally different. You're neurologically primed for a perpetual state of threat detection. Imagine living with the constant sensation that something terrible is about to happen. Every. Single. Moment.""

I know that feeling intimately.

Lilith is eight and a half months pregnant now. The baby could come any day. And all I can think about is the pattern. The curse. The genetic inheritance that seems to hunt my family like a predator.

That night, I dream.

Not of monsters or supernatural entities. But of a simple, terrifying truth:

What if the real horror is inside us? Coded into our very DNA?

What if our child is already marked?

My great-grandfather, Elias Pearce, was found dismembered in a locked barn, every single bone meticulously separated and arranged in a perfect geometric pattern. No tools were ever found. No explanation ever given.

My grandfather, Magnus Pearce, disappeared entirely during a family camping trip. Search parties found nothing‚Äînot a strand of hair, not a scrap of clothing. Just a small patch of ground where something had clearly happened, the earth scorched in a perfect circle as if something had burned so intensely that it consumed everything around it, leaving only a memory of heat.

My father, Nathaniel? He was discovered in our family's basement, his body contorted into an impossible position, eyes wide open but completely white‚Äîno pupils, no iris, just blank, milky surfaces that seemed to reflect something from another world.

And now, here I am. The last Pearce. With a wife who doesn't know. With a child growing inside her, unaware of the genetic lottery they've already been entered into.

The genealogy book falls open to a page I've memorized a thousand times. A loose photograph slips out‚Äîa family portrait from 1923. My ancestors stare back, their faces rigid and unsmiling. But if you look closely‚Äîand I have, countless times‚Äîthere's something else in their eyes. A knowledge. A terrible, suffocating knowledge.

Lilith calls from the kitchen. ""Breakfast is ready, love.""

I close the book.

The eggs grow cold on my plate. Lilith watches me, her green eyes searching, a furrow of concern creasing her forehead. She knows something's wrong. She's always known how to read the subtle tremors in my silence.

""You're thinking about your family again,"" she says. It's not a question.

I force a smile. ""Just tired.""

But tired isn't the word. Haunted. Terrified. Trapped.

My fingers unconsciously trace a small birthmark on the inside of my wrist‚Äîa strange, intricate pattern that looks less like a natural mark and more like a symbol. A symbol I've never been able to identify, despite years of research. It's been in every Pearce male's family photo, always in the same location, always identical.

Lilith's pregnancy is now in her seventh month. The baby moves constantly, pressing against her skin like something desperate to escape. Sometimes, in the quiet moments before dawn, I've watched those movements and wondered if it's trying to escape something more than the confines of her womb.

The genealogy book remains open on the kitchen counter. I catch Lilith glancing at it, her curiosity barely contained. She knows I'm secretive about my family history. Most of my relatives are dead or disappeared, and the few photographs that remain are locked away in a fireproof safe in my study.

""Tell me about your great-grandfather,"" she says suddenly.

My hand freezes midway to my coffee mug.

""There's nothing to tell,"" I manage.

But that's a lie. There's everything to tell.

Elias Pearce. The first documented instance of our family's... peculiarity. He was a cartographer, always traveling to remote locations, mapping territories no one had ever charted. His journals, the few that survived, spoke of places that didn't exist on any official map. Places with geometries that didn't make sense. Landscapes that seemed to breathe.

The last entry, dated December 17th, 1889, was a series of increasingly frantic sketches. Impossible architectural designs. Symbols that hurt your eyes if you looked at them too long. And at the bottom, in handwriting that grew more erratic with each line:

*They are watching. They have always been watching. The map is not the territory. The territory is alive.*

Those were his final words.

When they found him in that locked barn, his body systematically dismantled like a complex mechanical puzzle, the local sheriff's report read like a fever dream. Bones arranged in perfect mathematical precision. No blood. No signs of struggle. Just... reorganization.

Lilith's hand touches my arm, pulling me back to the present.

""Ezra? Are you listening?""

I realize I've been staring into nothing, my coffee growing cold, the birthmark on my wrist suddenly feeling hot. Burning.

""I'm fine,"" I lie.

But the curse is never fine. The curse is always waiting.

And our child is coming soon.

The ultrasound images are wrong.

Not obviously so. Not in a way that would alarm a typical doctor or technician. But I see it. The subtle asymmetries. The impossible angles. The way the fetus's bones seem to bend in directions that shouldn't be anatomically possible.

Lilith keeps the images pinned to our refrigerator, a proud mother-to-be displaying her first glimpses of our unborn child. Each time I look, I feel something crawl beneath my skin. Something ancient. Something watching.

Dr. Helena Reyes is our obstetrician. She's been nothing but professional, but I've caught her looking at me. Not at Lilith. At me. Her eyes hold a recognition that makes my blood run cold.

""Everything is progressing... normally,"" she said during our last appointment, the pause before ""normally"" hanging in the air like a barely concealed lie.

That night, I pulled out the old family documents again. Tucked between brittle pages of the genealogy book, I found a letter. The paper was so old it crumbled at the edges, but the ink remained sharp. Written by my grandfather Magnus, addressed to no one and everyone:

*The child always comes. The child has always been coming. We are merely vessels. Carriers. The lineage demands its continuation.*

What lineage? Continuation of what?

Lilith sleeps beside me, her breathing deep and even. Her belly rises and falls, the shape beneath her nightgown moving in ways that feel... calculated. Deliberate.

I trace my birthmark again. Under the moonlight streaming through our bedroom window, it looks less like a birthmark and more like a map. A map to nowhere. Or everywhere.

My father Nathaniel's final photographs are stored in a locked drawer in my study. I rarely look at them, but tonight feels different. Something is pulling me toward them. Calling me.

The photographs are strange. Not because of what they show, but because of what they don't show. In each family portrait going back generations, there's a consistent emptiness. A space. Always in the same location. As if something has been deliberately erased. Removed.

But removed before the photograph was even taken.

The baby kicks. Hard.

So hard that Lilith doesn't wake up, but I see her stomach distort. A shape pressing outward. Not like a normal fetal movement. More like something trying to push its way out.

Something trying to escape.

Or something trying to enter.

I close my eyes, but I can still see the map. The territory. The birthmark burning like a brand.

Our child is coming.

And I am terrified of what will arrive.

The old courthouse records sit spread across my desk, a constellation of pain mapped out in faded ink and brittle paper. I've been researching our family history for weeks now, driven by something more than curiosity. Something closer to survival.

Every Pearce male in the last five generations died or disappeared before their 35th birthday. Not a coincidence. Not anymore.

My father Nathaniel. Gone at 34.
My grandfather Magnus. Vanished at 33.
Great-grandfather Elias. Found mutilated at 35.

The pattern is too precise to be random.

I've collected newspaper clippings, court documents, medical records. Not the dramatic, sensational evidence one might expect, but the quiet, bureaucratic trail of destruction. Police reports with missing pages. Coroner's files with critical information redacted. Insurance claims that never quite add up.

Lilith finds me here most nights, surrounded by these documents. She doesn't ask questions anymore. Just brings me coffee, watches me with those green eyes that seem to hold more understanding than she lets on.

""The baby's room is almost ready,"" she says softly, placing a mug beside me.

I look up. The nursery door stands open. Pale yellow walls. Carefully selected furniture. Everything perfect. Too perfect.

""Have you ever wondered,"" I ask, ""why some families seem marked by tragedy?""

She sits down, her pregnancy making the movement careful, calculated. ""Some people are just unlucky.""

But I know it's more than luck. Something runs in our blood. Something that doesn't care about love, or hope, or the carefully constructed life we've built.

The birthmark on my wrist throbs. Not painfully. Just... present. A constant reminder.

I pull out the most disturbing document. A psychological evaluation of my grandfather Magnus, conducted two months before his disappearance. The psychiatrist's notes are clinical, detached:

*Patient exhibits extreme paranoia regarding familial 'curse'. Demonstrates intricate delusion of systematic family destruction. Fixates on biological determinism. Shows no signs of schizophrenia, but persistent ideation of inherited trauma suggests deep-seated psychological mechanisms at play.*

Inherited trauma. The words echo.

What if our family's destruction wasn't supernatural? What if it was something more insidious? A genetic predisposition to self-destruction? A psychological pattern so deeply ingrained that each generation unconsciously recreates the same narrative of loss?

Lilith's hand touches my shoulder. ""Coming to bed?""

I nod, but my mind is elsewhere. Calculating. The baby is due in six weeks. I have six weeks to understand what's happening to our family.

Six weeks to break a cycle that has consumed generations.

Six weeks to save our child.

If I can.

The research consumes me.

I've taken a leave of absence from work, my entire study transformed into a makeshift investigation center. Genetic reports. Psychiatric evaluations. Family medical histories stretching back over a century. Each document another piece of a horrifying puzzle.

Dr. Helena Reyes agrees to meet me privately. She's a geneticist specializing in inherited psychological disorders, recommended by a colleague who knew something was... unusual about my family history.

Her office is sterile. Meticulously organized. Nothing like the chaotic landscape of my own research.

""The Pearce family presents a fascinating case study,"" she says, sliding a manila folder across her desk. ""Generational patterns of self-destructive behavior, early mortality, and what appears to be a consistent psychological profile.""

I lean forward. ""What profile?""

She hesitates. Professional detachment wavering for just a moment.

""Extreme risk-taking behavior. Persistent paranoia. A documented inability to form long-term emotional connections. Each generation seems to unconsciously recreate traumatic family dynamics.""

My grandfather Magnus. My father Nathaniel. Their lives were a series of broken relationships, isolated existences, careers marked by sudden, inexplicable failures. And me? I'd fought against that pattern. Married Lilith. Built a stable life.

Or so I thought.

""There's something else,"" Dr. Reyes continues. ""We've identified a rare genetic mutation. Not something that causes a specific disease, but a variation that affects neural pathways related to threat perception and stress response.""

She shows me a complex genetic map. Chromosomal variations highlighted in clinical blue.

""In simplest terms,"" she explains, ""your family's brain chemistry is fundamentally different. You're neurologically primed for a perpetual state of threat detection. Imagine living with the constant sensation that something terrible is about to happen. Every. Single. Moment.""

I know that feeling intimately.

Lilith is eight and a half months pregnant now. The baby could come any day. And all I can think about is the pattern. The curse. The genetic inheritance that seems to hunt my family like a predator.

That night, I dream.

Not of monsters or supernatural entities. But of a simple, terrifying truth:

What if the real horror is inside us? Coded into our very DNA?

What if our child is already marked?

The contractions started at 3:17 AM.

Lilith's grip on my hand was vice-like, her breathing controlled despite the pain. The hospital room felt smaller with each passing minute, the white walls seeming to close in.

Dr. Reyes was there. Not our usual obstetrician, but the geneticist who had been studying our case. Her presence felt deliberate. Calculated.

""Everything is progressing normally,"" she said. The same phrase she'd used before. But nothing about our family had ever been normal.

Hours passed. The rhythmic beep of monitors. The soft rustle of medical equipment. My mind kept circling back to the research. The genetic markers. The documented family history of destruction.

At 11:42 AM, our son was born.

A healthy cry pierced the sterile hospital air. Normal. Perfectly, wonderfully normal.

Dr. Reyes ran her standard tests. Blood work. Genetic screening. I watched, my entire body tense, waiting for some sign of the curse that had haunted my family for generations.

Nothing.

Weeks turned into months. Our son, Gabriel, grew strong. Healthy. No signs of the psychological fractures that had destroyed my father, my grandfather, our ancestors. No mysterious disappearances. No unexplained tragedies.

I submitted every piece of medical documentation to Dr. Reyes. Comprehensive reports. Psychological evaluations. Each document a testament to Gabriel's complete normalcy.

""The genetic markers,"" I asked her during one of our final consultations, ""the predisposition to self-destruction?""

She looked tired. Professional. ""Sometimes,"" she said, ""breaking a cycle is possible. Not through supernatural intervention. But through understanding. Through choice.""

Lilith found me one night, surrounded by the old family documents. The genealogy book. The newspaper clippings. The medical records that had consumed me for so long.

""Are you ready?"" she asked.

I understood what she meant.

That night, I built a fire in our backyard. Watched the papers curl and burn. The history of destruction. The weight of inherited trauma. Turning to ash.

Gabriel played nearby, laughing. Innocent. Unaware of the darkness I was burning away.

For the first time in generations, a Pearce male would live. Truly live.

The curse was over.

The genealogy book sits heavy in my hands, its leather binding cracked and brittle, smelling of dust and something else‚Äîsomething older. Something that reminds me of dried blood and forgotten screams. My fingers trace the faded names, each one a testament to a legacy I never asked for but can never escape.

My name is Ezra Pearce. I am the last.

The morning light filters through the curtains of our modest suburban home, casting long shadows across the worn hardwood floors. Lilith is in the kitchen, her pregnant belly a gentle curve against her pale blue nightgown. She's humming something‚Äîa lullaby, perhaps‚Äîcompletely unaware of the weight of history that pulses through my veins.

I should have told her before we married. Before we conceived our child. But how do you explain a hereditary nightmare that defies rational explanation?

My father, Nathaniel, never spoke directly about the curse. Neither did his father, Jeremiah, or his father before him. It was always in hushed whispers, in sideways glances, in the way older relatives would grow silent when certain names were mentioned. The Pearce family tree was less a record of lineage and more a chronicle of horror.

Each generation lost someone. Always in ways that made local newspapers fall silent, that made police investigations mysteriously go cold, that made even hardened investigators look away and shake their heads.

""I'm fine,"" I lie.

But the curse is never fine. The curse is always waiting.

And our child is coming soon.

The ultrasound images are wrong.

Not obviously so. Not in a way that would alarm a typical doctor or technician. But I see it. The subtle asymmetries. The impossible angles. The way the fetus's bones seem to bend in directions that shouldn't be anatomically possible.

Lilith keeps the images pinned to our refrigerator, a proud mother-to-be displaying her first glimpses of our unborn child. Each time I look, I feel something crawl beneath my skin. Something ancient. Something watching.

Dr. Helena Reyes is our obstetrician. She's been nothing but professional, but I've caught her looking at me. Not at Lilith. At me. Her eyes hold a recognition that makes my blood run cold.

""Everything is progressing... normally,"" she said during our last appointment, the pause before ""normally"" hanging in the air like a barely concealed lie.

That night, I pulled out the old family documents again. Tucked between brittle pages of the genealogy book, I found a letter. The paper was so old it crumbled at the edges, but the ink remained sharp. Written by my grandfather Magnus, addressed to no one and everyone:

*The child always comes. The child has always been coming. We are merely vessels. Carriers. The lineage demands its continuation.*

What lineage? Continuation of what?

Lilith sleeps beside me, her breathing deep and even. Her belly rises and falls, the shape beneath her nightgown moving in ways that feel... calculated. Deliberate.

I trace my birthmark again. Under the moonlight streaming through our bedroom window, it looks less like a birthmark and more like a map. A map to nowhere. Or everywhere.

My father Nathaniel's final photographs are stored in a locked drawer in my study. I rarely look at them, but tonight feels different. Something is pulling me toward them. Calling me.

The photographs are strange. Not because of what they show, but because of what they don't show. In each family portrait going back generations, there's a consistent emptiness. A space. Always in the same location. As if something has been deliberately erased. Removed.

But removed before the photograph was even taken.

The baby kicks. Hard.

So hard that Lilith doesn't wake up, but I see her stomach distort. A shape pressing outward. Not like a normal fetal movement. More like something trying to push its way out.

Something trying to escape.

Or something trying to enter.

I close my eyes, but I can still see the map. The territory. The birthmark burning like a brand.

Our child is coming.

And I am terrified of what will arrive.

The old courthouse records sit spread across my desk, a constellation of pain mapped out in faded ink and brittle paper. I've been researching our family history for weeks now, driven by something more than curiosity. Something closer to survival.

Every Pearce male in the last five generations died or disappeared before their 35th birthday. Not a coincidence. Not anymore.

My father Nathaniel. Gone at 34.
My grandfather Magnus. Vanished at 33.
Great-grandfather Elias. Found mutilated at 35.

The pattern is too precise to be random.

I've collected newspaper clippings, court documents, medical records. Not the dramatic, sensational evidence one might expect, but the quiet, bureaucratic trail of destruction. Police reports with missing pages. Coroner's files with critical information redacted. Insurance claims that never quite add up.

Lilith finds me here most nights, surrounded by these documents. She doesn't ask questions anymore. Just brings me coffee, watches me with those green eyes that seem to hold more understanding than she lets on.

""The baby's room is almost ready,"" she says softly, placing a mug beside me.

I look up. The nursery door stands open. Pale yellow walls. Carefully selected furniture. Everything perfect. Too perfect.

""Have you ever wondered,"" I ask, ""why some families seem marked by tragedy?""

She sits down, her pregnancy making the movement careful, calculated. ""Some people are just unlucky.""

But I know it's more than luck. Something runs in our blood. Something that doesn't care about love, or hope, or the carefully constructed life we've built.

The birthmark on my wrist throbs. Not painfully. Just... present. A constant reminder.

I pull out the most disturbing document. A psychological evaluation of my grandfather Magnus, conducted two months before his disappearance. The psychiatrist's notes are clinical, detached:

*Patient exhibits extreme paranoia regarding familial 'curse'. Demonstrates intricate delusion of systematic family destruction. Fixates on biological determinism. Shows no signs of schizophrenia, but persistent ideation of inherited trauma suggests deep-seated psychological mechanisms at play.*

Inherited trauma. The words echo.

What if our family's destruction wasn't supernatural? What if it was something more insidious? A genetic predisposition to self-destruction? A psychological pattern so deeply ingrained that each generation unconsciously recreates the same narrative of loss?

Lilith's hand touches my shoulder. ""Coming to bed?""

I nod, but my mind is elsewhere. Calculating. The baby is due in six weeks. I have six weeks to understand what's happening to our family.

Six weeks to break a cycle that has consumed generations.

Six weeks to save our child.

If I can.

The research consumes me.

I've taken a leave of absence from work, my entire study transformed into a makeshift investigation center. Genetic reports. Psychiatric evaluations. Family medical histories stretching back over a century. Each document another piece of a horrifying puzzle.

Dr. Helena Reyes agrees to meet me privately. She's a geneticist specializing in inherited psychological disorders, recommended by a colleague who knew something was... unusual about my family history.

Her office is sterile. Meticulously organized. Nothing like the chaotic landscape of my own research.

""The Pearce family presents a fascinating case study,"" she says, sliding a manila folder across her desk. ""Generational patterns of self-destructive behavior, early mortality, and what appears to be a consistent psychological profile.""

I lean forward. ""What profile?""

She hesitates. Professional detachment wavering for just a moment.

""Extreme risk-taking behavior. Persistent paranoia. A documented inability to form long-term emotional connections. Each generation seems to unconsciously recreate traumatic family dynamics.""

My grandfather Magnus. My father Nathaniel. Their lives were a series of broken relationships, isolated existences, careers marked by sudden, inexplicable failures. And me? I'd fought against that pattern. Married Lilith. Built a stable life.

Or so I thought.

""There's something else,"" Dr. Reyes continues. ""We've identified a rare genetic mutation. Not something that causes a specific disease, but a variation that affects neural pathways related to threat perception and stress response.""

She shows me a complex genetic map. Chromosomal variations highlighted in clinical blue.

""In simplest terms,"" she explains, ""your family's brain chemistry is fundamentally different. You're neurologically primed for a perpetual state of threat detection. Imagine living with the constant sensation that something terrible is about to happen. Every. Single. Moment.""

I know that feeling intimately.

Lilith is eight and a half months pregnant now. The baby could come any day. And all I can think about is the pattern. The curse. The genetic inheritance that seems to hunt my family like a predator.

That night, I dream.

Not of monsters or supernatural entities. But of a simple, terrifying truth:

What if the real horror is inside us? Coded into our very DNA?

What if our child is already marked?

The contractions started at 3:17 AM.

Lilith's grip on my hand was vice-like, her breathing controlled despite the pain. The hospital room felt smaller with each passing minute, the white walls seeming to close in.

Dr. Reyes was there. Not our usual obstetrician, but the geneticist who had been studying our case. Her presence felt deliberate. Calculated.

""Everything is progressing normally,"" she said. The same phrase she'd used before. But nothing about our family had ever been normal.

Hours passed. The rhythmic beep of monitors. The soft rustle of medical equipment. My mind kept circling back to the research. The genetic markers. The documented family history of destruction.

At 11:42 AM, our son was born.

A healthy cry pierced the sterile hospital air. Normal. Perfectly, wonderfully normal.

Dr. Reyes ran her standard tests. Blood work. Genetic screening. I watched, my entire body tense, waiting for some sign of the curse that had haunted my family for generations.

Nothing.

Weeks turned into months. Our son, Gabriel, grew strong. Healthy. No signs of the psychological fractures that had destroyed my father, my grandfather, our ancestors. No mysterious disappearances. No unexplained tragedies.

I submitted every piece of medical documentation to Dr. Reyes. Comprehensive reports. Psychological evaluations. Each document a testament to Gabriel's complete normalcy.

""The genetic markers,"" I asked her during one of our final consultations, ""the predisposition to self-destruction?""

She looked tired. Professional. ""Sometimes,"" she said, ""breaking a cycle is possible. Not through supernatural intervention. But through understanding. Through choice.""

Lilith found me one night, surrounded by the old family documents. The genealogy book. The newspaper clippings. The medical records that had consumed me for so long.

""Are you ready?"" she asked.

I understood what she meant.

That night, I built a fire in our backyard. Watched the papers curl and burn. The history of destruction. The weight of inherited trauma. Turning to ash.

Gabriel played nearby, laughing. Innocent. Unaware of the darkness I was burning away.

For the first time in generations, a Pearce male would live. Truly live.

The curse was over.

1hfrvqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1hfrvqq/my_routine_when_im_my_most_productive_self/,My routine when I‚Äôm my most productive self,"# About Me

* I‚Äôm a late-20s professional and I‚Äôve tried many different routines to get the most out of my time and learned through trial and error what works for me and what doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve found that having a routine, like having a clean/organized living or working space, gives me room to think about the important things and not stress about what I should or shouldn‚Äôt be doing.
* I used to think I was a night owl, then I realized that I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúproductive‚Äù at night. I‚Äôm just staying up scrolling, watching stuff, etc. So I try to wake up earlier because I‚Äôm more likely to do things that make me (long term) happy like exercise, getting sunlight. At night, I let myself vibe more but I try to timebox things and get to bed at a reasonable time.
* Disclaimer: This may work for me but it does not mean it‚Äôll work for anyone else. Just sharing in case it helps someone. Notably, I don‚Äôt have kids and if you do, I don't know how much of this applies (I probably should be the one asking you questions lol)
* Disclaimer #2: There are times when you throw all routines out the window. This doesn‚Äôt apply to those times.
* Disclaimer #3: I do not have ADD/ADHD (as far as I can tell‚Ä¶) so if you do I have no idea if these will help and would recommend talking to a professional.
* Disclaimer #4: Give yourself grace. The fact that I (or you) are in this sub probably means you're focused on improving. That's a good sign in its own and like anything ""productivity"" is a skill that improves/gets easier over time.

# General Routine

* The timing changes based on whats going on with work or life, but this is a high level routine if helpful
   * 6:45a wake up / workout / get dressed
   * 8:15a breakfast/commute
   * 9a start work (focus on solo work)
   * 11a - 3p meetings
   * 3p - 6pm ish (solo or collaborative work)
   * 6p commute / dinner
   * 7p evening activities / catch up on work / wind down / chat with friends

# How I structure my day

* **Mornings (\~6a-11a)**
   * I‚Äôve experimented a bunch but I‚Äôm a workout first thing type person. After starting my day with a sweat or even a walk, I‚Äôve found I‚Äôm happier, more energized, and overall more prepared to deal with any BS that may come my way lol. If I‚Äôm feeling groggy, immediately doing a 1-2min stretch and opening the blinds helps as well. For people that don‚Äôt workout as much, I‚Äôd suggest walking, meditation, etc.
   * I try not to look at my phone in the first hour of the day. It‚Äôs like rolling the dice with anxiety and emotions before I‚Äôve even had time to prepare myself for the day. I try to only look at messages, socials, emails, etc. when I‚Äôm done with my workout, usually during my commute.
   * Caffeine (black tea/coffee) and high protein breakfast as the first meal of the day.
   * If I‚Äôm working from home (or I‚Äôm not working out that day) I try to take a morning walk around the block. Just to get some fresh air or ‚Äútouch some grass‚Äù before starting my day.
   * I try to reserve the first 60-90mins of my work day for the most important task of work that day. My brain is usually most open to hard problems and I haven‚Äôt gotten caught up on the days.
* **Afternoons (\~11a-5p)**
   * Try to be lighter on the carbs at lunch so I don‚Äôt give myself the itis.
   * If I‚Äôm feeling drowsy I‚Äôll have a green tea for a pick me up.
   * I‚Äôm most productive in the morning, so I try to schedule most meetings, collaborative sessions, etc for the afternoon.
   * The afternoons are most likely to be determined by whats going on in life or at work.
* **Evenings (\~6p-11p)**
   * If I have some activity/event for work or hanging out with friends I‚Äôll do that. Otherwise, I try to catch up on work, reading, studying, etc.
   * Write out a plan for the following day - either a structured schedule or just most important things to get done. I always try and write something. Even if its just a ‚Äúspend time with friends/family‚Äù because I‚Äôm on vacation. When I‚Äôm busy it helps me focus, when I‚Äôm intentionally trying to take it easy it helps me relax.
   * If I‚Äôm feeling anxious I‚Äôll usually journal or call/hang out with a friend. Whenever I speak or write out my problems they feel a lot less serious than when they‚Äôre stuck in my head.
   * I try my hardest to be in bed by 11:30pm. Super mixed results since I‚Äôm a night owl by nature.
   * My phone goes in another room when I‚Äôm sleep. I use my alarm clock to wake me in the mornings.
   * Unless I really have to, I try not to compromise on getting at least 7 hours of sleep. Personally, consistently getting less than 7 hours per night leads to being unproductive with my waking hours and eventually causes me to crash for 3+ days at a time.

# Tips/Tricks to get the most out of my time

* I use¬†an app to block apps that I know lead to distraction or cheap dopamine. I'm not super strict, but find its a good forcing function and blocks notifications that lead to me wasting time, while keeping the important ones (whereas Do not Disturb setting blocks everything).
* I use pomodoros for everything - deep work, time blocked tasks, and just general work. I do 25min intervals, 5min breaks, and 15min long breaks. Having a scheduled time to give my brain cheap dopamine, check notifications, stretch, use the restroom, etc. helps keep me on track and not let any ‚Äútime-wasting‚Äù activity snowball. It also helps me be accountable because my completed pomodoro time at the end of the day is a relatively objective metric to let me know how well I did.
* I listen to more ambient music or at least music w/ minimal words (usually upbeat stuff - house, amapiano, jazz) because I get distracted listening to music with words. Also, I'll go for longer playlist mixes so I don't have to worry about changing tracks, skipping songs, etc. So usually I'll listen to longer mixes (2 hrs+ plus). Happy to share mixes I like if folks are interested.
* I use¬†tech/apps to stay on top of my reading list (newsletters, PDF‚Äôs, research papers, etc). It‚Äôs helpful for staying on top of the latest trends and tech and I listen while I workout, commute, or do chores around the house.",2,1734378919.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

The genealogy book sits heavy in my hands, its leather binding cracked and brittle, smelling of dust and something else‚Äîsomething older. Something that reminds me of dried blood and forgotten screams. My fingers trace the faded names, each one a testament to a legacy I never asked for but can never escape.

My name is Ezra Pearce. I am the last.

The morning light filters through the curtains of our modest suburban home, casting long shadows across the worn hardwood floors. Lilith is in the kitchen, her pregnant belly a gentle curve against her pale blue nightgown. She's humming something‚Äîa lullaby, perhaps‚Äîcompletely unaware of the weight of history that pulses through my veins.

I should have told her before we married. Before we conceived our child. But how do you explain a hereditary nightmare that defies rational explanation?

My father, Nathaniel, never spoke directly about the curse. Neither did his father, Jeremiah, or his father before him. It was always in hushed whispers, in sideways glances, in the way older relatives would grow silent when certain names were mentioned. The Pearce family tree was less a record of lineage and more a chronicle of horror.

Each generation lost someone. Always in ways that made local newspapers fall silent, that made police investigations mysteriously go cold, that made even hardened investigators look away and shake their heads.

My great-grandfather, Elias Pearce, was found dismembered in a locked barn, every single bone meticulously separated and arranged in a perfect geometric pattern. No tools were ever found. No explanation ever given.

My grandfather, Magnus Pearce, disappeared entirely during a family camping trip. Search parties found nothing‚Äînot a strand of hair, not a scrap of clothing. Just a small patch of ground where something had clearly happened, the earth scorched in a perfect circle as if something had burned so intensely that it consumed everything around it, leaving only a memory of heat.

My father, Nathaniel? He was discovered in our family's basement, his body contorted into an impossible position, eyes wide open but completely white‚Äîno pupils, no iris, just blank, milky surfaces that seemed to reflect something from another world.

And now, here I am. The last Pearce. With a wife who doesn't know. With a child growing inside her, unaware of the genetic lottery they've already been entered into.

The genealogy book falls open to a page I've memorized a thousand times. A loose photograph slips out‚Äîa family portrait from 1923. My ancestors stare back, their faces rigid and unsmiling. But if you look closely‚Äîand I have, countless times‚Äîthere's something else in their eyes. A knowledge. A terrible, suffocating knowledge.

Lilith calls from the kitchen. ""Breakfast is ready, love.""

I close the book.

The eggs grow cold on my plate. Lilith watches me, her green eyes searching, a furrow of concern creasing her forehead. She knows something's wrong. She's always known how to read the subtle tremors in my silence.

""You're thinking about your family again,"" she says. It's not a question.

I force a smile. ""Just tired.""

But tired isn't the word. Haunted. Terrified. Trapped.

My fingers unconsciously trace a small birthmark on the inside of my wrist‚Äîa strange, intricate pattern that looks less like a natural mark and more like a symbol. A symbol I've never been able to identify, despite years of research. It's been in every Pearce male's family photo, always in the same location, always identical.

Lilith's pregnancy is now in her seventh month. The baby moves constantly, pressing against her skin like something desperate to escape. Sometimes, in the quiet moments before dawn, I've watched those movements and wondered if it's trying to escape something more than the confines of her womb.

The genealogy book remains open on the kitchen counter. I catch Lilith glancing at it, her curiosity barely contained. She knows I'm secretive about my family history. Most of my relatives are dead or disappeared, and the few photographs that remain are locked away in a fireproof safe in my study.

""Tell me about your great-grandfather,"" she says suddenly.

My hand freezes midway to my coffee mug.

""There's nothing to tell,"" I manage.

But that's a lie. There's everything to tell.

Elias Pearce. The first documented instance of our family's... peculiarity. He was a cartographer, always traveling to remote locations, mapping territories no one had ever charted. His journals, the few that survived, spoke of places that didn't exist on any official map. Places with geometries that didn't make sense. Landscapes that seemed to breathe.

The last entry, dated December 17th, 1889, was a series of increasingly frantic sketches. Impossible architectural designs. Symbols that hurt your eyes if you looked at them too long. And at the bottom, in handwriting that grew more erratic with each line:

*They are watching. They have always been watching. The map is not the territory. The territory is alive.*

Those were his final words.

When they found him in that locked barn, his body systematically dismantled like a complex mechanical puzzle, the local sheriff's report read like a fever dream. Bones arranged in perfect mathematical precision. No blood. No signs of struggle. Just... reorganization.

Lilith's hand touches my arm, pulling me back to the present.

""Ezra? Are you listening?""

I realize I've been staring into nothing, my coffee growing cold, the birthmark on my wrist suddenly feeling hot. Burning.

""I'm fine,"" I lie.

But the curse is never fine. The curse is always waiting.

And our child is coming soon.

The ultrasound images are wrong.

Not obviously so. Not in a way that would alarm a typical doctor or technician. But I see it. The subtle asymmetries. The impossible angles. The way the fetus's bones seem to bend in directions that shouldn't be anatomically possible.

My father, Nathaniel? He was discovered in our family's basement, his body contorted into an impossible position, eyes wide open but completely white‚Äîno pupils, no iris, just blank, milky surfaces that seemed to reflect something from another world.

And now, here I am. The last Pearce. With a wife who doesn't know. With a child growing inside her, unaware of the genetic lottery they've already been entered into.

The genealogy book falls open to a page I've memorized a thousand times. A loose photograph slips out‚Äîa family portrait from 1923. My ancestors stare back, their faces rigid and unsmiling. But if you look closely‚Äîand I have, countless times‚Äîthere's something else in their eyes. A knowledge. A terrible, suffocating knowledge.

Lilith calls from the kitchen. ""Breakfast is ready, love.""

I close the book.

The eggs grow cold on my plate. Lilith watches me, her green eyes searching, a furrow of concern creasing her forehead. She knows something's wrong. She's always known how to read the subtle tremors in my silence.

""You're thinking about your family again,"" she says. It's not a question.

I force a smile. ""Just tired.""

But tired isn't the word. Haunted. Terrified. Trapped.

My fingers unconsciously trace a small birthmark on the inside of my wrist‚Äîa strange, intricate pattern that looks less like a natural mark and more like a symbol. A symbol I've never been able to identify, despite years of research. It's been in every Pearce male's family photo, always in the same location, always identical.

Lilith's pregnancy is now in her seventh month. The baby moves constantly, pressing against her skin like something desperate to escape. Sometimes, in the quiet moments before dawn, I've watched those movements and wondered if it's trying to escape something more than the confines of her womb.

The genealogy book remains open on the kitchen counter. I catch Lilith glancing at it, her curiosity barely contained. She knows I'm secretive about my family history. Most of my relatives are dead or disappeared, and the few photographs that remain are locked away in a fireproof safe in my study.

""Tell me about your great-grandfather,"" she says suddenly.

My hand freezes midway to my coffee mug.

""There's nothing to tell,"" I manage.

But that's a lie. There's everything to tell.

Elias Pearce. The first documented instance of our family's... peculiarity. He was a cartographer, always traveling to remote locations, mapping territories no one had ever charted. His journals, the few that survived, spoke of places that didn't exist on any official map. Places with geometries that didn't make sense. Landscapes that seemed to breathe.

The last entry, dated December 17th, 1889, was a series of increasingly frantic sketches. Impossible architectural designs. Symbols that hurt your eyes if you looked at them too long. And at the bottom, in handwriting that grew more erratic with each line:

*They are watching. They have always been watching. The map is not the territory. The territory is alive.*

Those were his final words.

When they found him in that locked barn, his body systematically dismantled like a complex mechanical puzzle, the local sheriff's report read like a fever dream. Bones arranged in perfect mathematical precision. No blood. No signs of struggle. Just... reorganization.

Lilith's hand touches my arm, pulling me back to the present.

""Ezra? Are you listening?""

I realize I've been staring into nothing, my coffee growing cold, the birthmark on my wrist suddenly feeling hot. Burning.

""I'm fine,"" I lie.

But the curse is never fine. The curse is always waiting.

And our child is coming soon.

The ultrasound images are wrong.

Not obviously so. Not in a way that would alarm a typical doctor or technician. But I see it. The subtle asymmetries. The impossible angles. The way the fetus's bones seem to bend in directions that shouldn't be anatomically possible.

Lilith keeps the images pinned to our refrigerator, a proud mother-to-be displaying her first glimpses of our unborn child. Each time I look, I feel something crawl beneath my skin. Something ancient. Something watching.

Dr. Helena Reyes is our obstetrician. She's been nothing but professional, but I've caught her looking at me. Not at Lilith. At me. Her eyes hold a recognition that makes my blood run cold.

""Everything is progressing... normally,"" she said during our last appointment, the pause before ""normally"" hanging in the air like a barely concealed lie.

That night, I pulled out the old family documents again. Tucked between brittle pages of the genealogy book, I found a letter. The paper was so old it crumbled at the edges, but the ink remained sharp. Written by my grandfather Magnus, addressed to no one and everyone:

*The child always comes. The child has always been coming. We are merely vessels. Carriers. The lineage demands its continuation.*

What lineage? Continuation of what?

Lilith sleeps beside me, her breathing deep and even. Her belly rises and falls, the shape beneath her nightgown moving in ways that feel... calculated. Deliberate.

I trace my birthmark again. Under the moonlight streaming through our bedroom window, it looks less like a birthmark and more like a map. A map to nowhere. Or everywhere.

My father Nathaniel's final photographs are stored in a locked drawer in my study. I rarely look at them, but tonight feels different. Something is pulling me toward them. Calling me.

The photographs are strange. Not because of what they show, but because of what they don't show. In each family portrait going back generations, there's a consistent emptiness. A space. Always in the same location. As if something has been deliberately erased. Removed.

But removed before the photograph was even taken.

The baby kicks. Hard.

So hard that Lilith doesn't wake up, but I see her stomach distort. A shape pressing outward. Not like a normal fetal movement. More like something trying to push its way out.

Something trying to escape.

Or something trying to enter.

I close my eyes, but I can still see the map. The territory. The birthmark burning like a brand.

Our child is coming.

And I am terrified of what will arrive.

The old courthouse records sit spread across my desk, a constellation of pain mapped out in faded ink and brittle paper. I've been researching our family history for weeks now, driven by something more than curiosity. Something closer to survival.

Every Pearce male in the last five generations died or disappeared before their 35th birthday. Not a coincidence. Not anymore.

My father Nathaniel. Gone at 34.
My grandfather Magnus. Vanished at 33.
Great-grandfather Elias. Found mutilated at 35.

The pattern is too precise to be random.

I've collected newspaper clippings, court documents, medical records. Not the dramatic, sensational evidence one might expect, but the quiet, bureaucratic trail of destruction. Police reports with missing pages. Coroner's files with critical information redacted. Insurance claims that never quite add up.

Lilith finds me here most nights, surrounded by these documents. She doesn't ask questions anymore. Just brings me coffee, watches me with those green eyes that seem to hold more understanding than she lets on.

""The baby's room is almost ready,"" she says softly, placing a mug beside me.

I look up. The nursery door stands open. Pale yellow walls. Carefully selected furniture. Everything perfect. Too perfect.

""Have you ever wondered,"" I ask, ""why some families seem marked by tragedy?""

She sits down, her pregnancy making the movement careful, calculated. ""Some people are just unlucky.""

But I know it's more than luck. Something runs in our blood. Something that doesn't care about love, or hope, or the carefully constructed life we've built.

The birthmark on my wrist throbs. Not painfully. Just... present. A constant reminder.

I pull out the most disturbing document. A psychological evaluation of my grandfather Magnus, conducted two months before his disappearance. The psychiatrist's notes are clinical, detached:

*Patient exhibits extreme paranoia regarding familial 'curse'. Demonstrates intricate delusion of systematic family destruction. Fixates on biological determinism. Shows no signs of schizophrenia, but persistent ideation of inherited trauma suggests deep-seated psychological mechanisms at play.*

Inherited trauma. The words echo.

What if our family's destruction wasn't supernatural? What if it was something more insidious? A genetic predisposition to self-destruction? A psychological pattern so deeply ingrained that each generation unconsciously recreates the same narrative of loss?

Lilith's hand touches my shoulder. ""Coming to bed?""

I nod, but my mind is elsewhere. Calculating. The baby is due in six weeks. I have six weeks to understand what's happening to our family.

Six weeks to break a cycle that has consumed generations.

Six weeks to save our child.

If I can.

The research consumes me.

I've taken a leave of absence from work, my entire study transformed into a makeshift investigation center. Genetic reports. Psychiatric evaluations. Family medical histories stretching back over a century. Each document another piece of a horrifying puzzle.

Dr. Helena Reyes agrees to meet me privately. She's a geneticist specializing in inherited psychological disorders, recommended by a colleague who knew something was... unusual about my family history.

Her office is sterile. Meticulously organized. Nothing like the chaotic landscape of my own research.

""The Pearce family presents a fascinating case study,"" she says, sliding a manila folder across her desk. ""Generational patterns of self-destructive behavior, early mortality, and what appears to be a consistent psychological profile.""

I lean forward. ""What profile?""

She hesitates. Professional detachment wavering for just a moment.

""Extreme risk-taking behavior. Persistent paranoia. A documented inability to form long-term emotional connections. Each generation seems to unconsciously recreate traumatic family dynamics.""

My grandfather Magnus. My father Nathaniel. Their lives were a series of broken relationships, isolated existences, careers marked by sudden, inexplicable failures. And me? I'd fought against that pattern. Married Lilith. Built a stable life.

Or so I thought.

""There's something else,"" Dr. Reyes continues. ""We've identified a rare genetic mutation. Not something that causes a specific disease, but a variation that affects neural pathways related to threat perception and stress response.""

She shows me a complex genetic map. Chromosomal variations highlighted in clinical blue.

""In simplest terms,"" she explains, ""your family's brain chemistry is fundamentally different. You're neurologically primed for a perpetual state of threat detection. Imagine living with the constant sensation that something terrible is about to happen. Every. Single. Moment.""

I know that feeling intimately.

Lilith is eight and a half months pregnant now. The baby could come any day. And all I can think about is the pattern. The curse. The genetic inheritance that seems to hunt my family like a predator.

That night, I dream.

Not of monsters or supernatural entities. But of a simple, terrifying truth:

What if the real horror is inside us? Coded into our very DNA?

What if our child is already marked?

The contractions started at 3:17 AM.

Lilith's grip on my hand was vice-like, her breathing controlled despite the pain. The hospital room felt smaller with each passing minute, the white walls seeming to close in.

Dr. Reyes was there. Not our usual obstetrician, but the geneticist who had been studying our case. Her presence felt deliberate. Calculated.

""Everything is progressing normally,"" she said. The same phrase she'd used before. But nothing about our family had ever been normal.

Hours passed. The rhythmic beep of monitors. The soft rustle of medical equipment. My mind kept circling back to the research. The genetic markers. The documented family history of destruction.

At 11:42 AM, our son was born.

A healthy cry pierced the sterile hospital air. Normal. Perfectly, wonderfully normal.

Dr. Reyes ran her standard tests. Blood work. Genetic screening. I watched, my entire body tense, waiting for some sign of the curse that had haunted my family for generations.

Nothing.

Weeks turned into months. Our son, Gabriel, grew strong. Healthy. No signs of the psychological fractures that had destroyed my father, my grandfather, our ancestors. No mysterious disappearances. No unexplained tragedies.

I submitted every piece of medical documentation to Dr. Reyes. Comprehensive reports. Psychological evaluations. Each document a testament to Gabriel's complete normalcy.

""The genetic markers,"" I asked her during one of our final consultations, ""the predisposition to self-destruction?""

She looked tired. Professional. ""Sometimes,"" she said, ""breaking a cycle is possible. Not through supernatural intervention. But through understanding. Through choice.""

Lilith found me one night, surrounded by the old family documents. The genealogy book. The newspaper clippings. The medical records that had consumed me for so long.

""Are you ready?"" she asked.

I understood what she meant.

That night, I built a fire in our backyard. Watched the papers curl and burn. The history of destruction. The weight of inherited trauma. Turning to ash.

Gabriel played nearby, laughing. Innocent. Unaware of the darkness I was burning away.

For the first time in generations, a Pearce male would live. Truly live.

The curse was over.

Something that reminds me of dried blood and forgotten screams. My fingers trace the faded names, each one a testament to a legacy I never asked for but can never escape.

My name is Ezra Pearce. I am the last.

The morning light filters through the curtains of our modest suburban home, casting long shadows across the worn hardwood floors. Lilith is in the kitchen, her pregnant belly a gentle curve against her pale blue nightgown. She's humming something‚Äîa lullaby, perhaps‚Äîcompletely unaware of the weight of history that pulses through my veins.

I should have told her before we married. Before we conceived our child. But how do you explain a hereditary nightmare that defies rational explanation?

My father, Nathaniel, never spoke directly about the curse. Neither did his father, Jeremiah, or his father before him. It was always in hushed whispers, in sideways glances, in the way older relatives would grow silent when certain names were mentioned. The Pearce family tree was less a record of lineage and more a chronicle of horror.

Each generation lost someone. Always in ways that made local newspapers fall silent, that made police investigations mysteriously go cold, that made even hardened investigators look away and shake their heads.

My great-grandfather, Elias Pearce, was found dismembered in a locked barn, every single bone meticulously separated and arranged in a perfect geometric pattern. No tools were ever found. No explanation ever given.

My grandfather, Magnus Pearce, disappeared entirely during a family camping trip. Search parties found nothing‚Äînot a strand of hair, not a scrap of clothing. Just a small patch of ground where something had clearly happened, the earth scorched in a perfect circle as if something had burned so intensely that it consumed everything around it, leaving only a memory of heat.

1hfrrly,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1hfrrly/my_review_of_peanut_roasted_sesame_and_almond/,My review of Peanut & Roasted Sesame and Almond Croissant (Vertuo),"I like to search for reviews when there are new flavours so here are my thoughts on the two new holiday flavours: 

***Peanut & Roasted Sesame*** 

I am possibly a bit biased towards this one. I love sesame and peanut anything. I've been known to eat tahini and peanut butter straight from the jar. I always have halva and hummus in my fridge. I put double the amount of peanuts in my stir fries. So needless to say, I was excited to try this one. 

The scent while brewing is definitely sweet and sesame scented. Its very pleasant. The actual background taste in the coffee is peanut. At first sip I thought it was a tiny bit odd, but it was very mild tasting and not overpowering like so many flavoured pods can be. Combined with the sweet scent it makes a pleasant mild coffee. This would pair well with dessert that is slightly bitter, dark chocolate brownies come to mind. The overall intensity is on par with a medium roast. 

I would definitely buy more as I likely wont get sick of this one any time soon like I did with Peppermint and Gingerbread. [I sampled it with milk/oat milk and half tsp sugar.]


***Almond Croissant*** 

Ok I will be honest. I almost didnt buy this one. I despise almond extract. Its bitter and fake. I still have PTSD from the horrendous squirrel-piss Amaretti pod released several years back. Almonds strolling in the Forest was a mild improvement, but not groundbreaking enough to buy multiple sleeves. 

This pod promised more ""buttery pastry notes"" so I took the plunge. The scent while brewing is reminiscent of almond extract, similar to baking an almond cake in the oven. There is almond extract in the taste as well but thankfully it is mild with some slight bitter notes. The coffee shines through without feeling like youre getting a golden shower of straight almond. This would probably pair well with an actual almond, hazelnut or chocolate croissant. I do get more buttery notes with this one. Its possible Nespresso finally got almond right this time. The overall intensity is on par with a medium roast. 

Would I buy again? Possibly. Its definitely one of the better flavoured Nespresso pods out there at the moment. Still waiting for them to get Caramel right. [I sampled it with milk/oat milk and half tsp sugar.] 

Note: I did not purchase the unforgettable espresso pod but let me know how you like that one.",1,1734378618.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

1hfrr0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatizeThemBack/comments/1hfrr0n/ex_stalked_and_harassed_me_after_we_broke_up_10/,"Ex stalked and harassed me after we broke up. 10 years later, karma caught up with him.","My ex(34M) recently reached out to me (32F) after 10 years of no contact.

When we broke up we agreed to 'stay friends' but what started as the occasional text or phone call from him esculated into multiple texts, calls and voicemails, Facebook messages and emails asking why I hadn't responded yet. These would usually cycle in patterns of wanting to hang out as friends, telling me he still loved me, and calling me heartless and childish for pushing him away.

At one point he called me, extremely angry, because he had been logging into my Facebook and seen a message from my new housemate which he thought was flirtatious. I changed all my passwords, blocked him on everything, tried going full no contact.

2 months later I find out he created a fake Facebook profile using a sexual image of a woman (it didn't show her face) and an imitation of my name and was using it to interact with my friends.

I'm young. I don't realise this is criminal. I don't think to call the police.

He then used the photo to ask immoral strangers on 4chan if they could 'investigate' and prove that it was me.

So at this point he realised he'd gone too far  and apparently had a full psychotic break from reality. His landlord called the police and he ended up detained under the mental health act for being a danger to himself and others.

A year of no contact later he creates a new Facebook to reach out again, asking to meet up for a 'no strings attached coffee' as he's written a book about his psychosis and he wanted to clear the air with me. I decline a face to face chat but ask to read his book, he's confused to why I don't want to meet him and becomes angry that I keep asking to read the book. I block him again.

After 10 years of complete no contact he reaches out again, on another new account, I don't answer but this prompts me to check his profile and see that he has just self published the book. In it he admits to reading my messages but fails to mention all the stalking, harassment, impersonation, defamation, and dodgy shit on 4chan. Instead he accuses me of being the abusive one.

I discover I still have access to all facebook conversations, even from deleted accounts. I send him the screenshots of him admitting to these crimes 10 years ago. He blocks me. I discover he's on Twitter saying I'm accusing him of breaking the law when he hasn't. I create a twitter account and post the screenshots there. In a grave error of judgement he retweets me, trying to mock me, but in doing so draws attention to my account. He panics, calls the police and claims I'm harassing him. The police call me for my side and I explain all of this. They call him back to tell him he's the only one who's broken the law, and if he contacts me again I have the right to press charges. He had even submitted 'evidence' for his claim which the police told me hadn't done him any favours and actually supported my version of events.

He somehow still thinks he's in the right and made a 25 minute YouTube video complaining how none of this is fair. He acknowledges that my twitter account is harmless and within the confines of the law (the only thing that connects it to him are the screenshots of his now deleted replies saying ""No one cares about this but you. Move on."") but complains about how draining it is for him that I'm attacking his reputation. 

Although he can't see himself in my shoes and realise how he traumatised me 10 years ago, it's nice to know he's had a taste of his own medicine and it made him throw a tantrum. 

(And also that his own VOLUNTEERED evidence damned him. Good god I can't even describe how good that felt.)",1,1734378576.0,traumatizeThemBack,0,1.0,False

	‚Ä¢	Senior Agents Carry the Load: Top-performing senior agents make more than team managers but end up babysitting new hires who are barely trained. Instead of fostering a strong team, the company piles all the work onto the seniors because, well, someone has to clean up the mess.
	‚Ä¢	No Raises, No Matter What: Crush your targets? Pull in big numbers? Doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äîthis company doesn‚Äôt believe in raises. You could break records and still get treated like an expendable cog.

	‚Ä¢	Outsourcing Over Local Impact: Forget supporting the local economy. They‚Äôre busy outsourcing jobs to the Philippines and Colombia to save a few bucks. Quality? Doesn‚Äôt matter. Supporting local workers? Not their problem.
	‚Ä¢	Quantity > Quality: They‚Äôd rather hire 20 clueless newbies than 5 solid employees who can actually get the job done. Turnover is insane, and it shows.

[Critical minerals outlook: M&A to ramp up](https://www.allens.com.au/insights-news/insights/2024/11/critical-minerals-outlook-ma-to-ramp-up/)

  
***2024 was a turbulent year for dealmakers, project developers and investors in critical minerals. New supply outpacing short-term demand growth in immature markets led to declining prices, affecting financing availability and dealmaking activity.***

https://preview.redd.it/4n757qupd77e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4e684726d73ee1c047887f6634f3e2a4b30e21d

However, we see reasons for optimism in the coming year. Recent large-scale M&A activity shows that‚Äîwhile there may be oversupply of certain critical minerals in today's market‚Äîlong-term demand is growing in line with the expansion of clean energy technologies and the global energy transition.

Moreover, we expect to see increasing competition for ownership and control of assets and associated infrastructure as governments around the world increasingly look to inject themselves (and their capital) into securing and investing in critical minerals supply chains. Specifically, we have seen state government and federal government financial support for Australian-based critical mineral companies including the recently announced funding package for Illuka's flagship Eneabba rare earths refinery project.¬†¬†

In this¬†*Insight*, we'll look back at the trends in critical minerals from 2024 and explain what to expect in 2025.

[GOOD READ WITH COFFEE....](https://preview.redd.it/bfvqq2dfe77e1.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=300996e0a3dbef70709f670631c31554bc14e77c)

# Developers will increasingly rely on creative financing strategies to get deals done

Traditional greenfield project financing has been challenging for critical minerals developers amid softer commodity prices. This has opened the door to other, alternative sources of funding from government and offtakers to supplement traditional project financing from banks. We expect developers to continue to look for more creative ways to finance projects.

Over the last few years we've seen an increased role for government lenders to provide support during the initial phases of development and ramp up. Similarly, customers focused on securing long-term supply are putting their hands into their pockets to assist with the startup funding. Customer finance can come in a variety of forms; from pure debt to offtake prepayments and convertible note structures. Ultimatley, given customer lenders want the product rather than straight repayment of the debt, they can apply a different credit lens, thereby removing some of the obstacles to a traditional project financing. Such financing arrangements also offer a short-term solution that we expect will only increase in 2025 as producers seek to diversify their capital stacks.

That said, with interest rates expected to fall, we still expect that major domestic and international lenders will be critical to the debt financing of critical minerals projects‚Äîparticularly later in the lifecycle of the projects that are operational. Many banks are still bullish on critical minerals, and we expect they will be eager to put their balance sheets to work to finance the energy transition as prices recover.

With a thunderous launch, the US Army‚Äôs Dark Eagle hypersonic missile has just blazed past years of delays, signaling a bold new surge in America‚Äôs race for long-range precision firepower against China and Russia.

This month, The War Zone¬†[reported](https://www.twz.com/land/army-dark-eagle-hypersonic-missile-finally-blasts-out-of-its-launcher)¬†that the US Army successfully test-fired its Dark Eagle hypersonic missile from a trailer-based launcher at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. The test marks a significant milestone after years of delays due to launcher issues.

  
The test, conducted by the US Army‚Äôs Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) and the US Navy Strategic Systems Programs, involved the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), also known as the common All Up Round (AUR) missile.

The report notes that the missile, which the US Navy plans to deploy on Zumwalt-class destroyers and Block V Virginia-class submarines, achieved hypersonic speeds exceeding Mach 5.

The War Zone says that various aircraft, including NASA‚Äôs WB-57F and the Missile Defense Agency‚Äôs (MDA) HALO jets, observed the test, demonstrating the missile‚Äôs capability to reach target distances at hypersonic speeds.

***3.1. Metallic Materials for Hypersonics Metallic materials are ubiquitously used in hypersonic vehicles ‚Äì as nose and wing leading edges, control surfaces, and engine inlets ‚Äì due to their tendency to their damage tolerance and manufacturability. These components need to withstand extremely high heat fluxes and thermal strains, which demand materials with high melting points that maintain strength at high temperatures. Pure elements with high melting points (W, Re, Ta, Mo, Nb, V, Cr, Ti, Ni) form the basis of fielded high temperature alloys. For instance, Ti was employed in hot aeroshell structures in the SR-71 \[5, 15\] the nose section of the X-43 contained a SD 180 tungsten heavy alloy \[51\], a Haynes Ni-base alloy was used in the Mach 7 X-43 variant \[52\], and both MoRe and Ni-base alloys have been tested for heat pipe structures \[11\]. Other refractory metals, such as the TaWHf alloys T111 and T222 (see Box 1) exhibit favorable creep-resistant materials properties and are ideal for the extended containment of heated liquid alkali-metal working fluids (1000-1300¬∞C) for heat pipe type leading edge designs \[53\].***

# Introduction

In the evolving landscape of global defense, the arms race has metamorphosed from a contest of nuclear might to one of unparalleled speed.¬†[Hypersonic weapons](https://www.csis.org/analysis/complex-air-defense-countering-hypersonic-missile-threat)¬†(capable of exceeding¬†[five times the speed of sound](https://www.domailleengineering.com/niobium-c103-unique-hypersonics/)), promise to revolutionize modern warfare.

China's strides in the hypersonic field are a manifestation of its broader strategic intentions and underscore its drive toward technological and military preeminence. This journey toward mastering hypersonic technology is not merely for show; it is about redefining the global balance of military power.

A successful deployment of these weapons would enable China to redefine the term ‚Äúfirst-strike advantage.‚Äù Such a capability is not merely about striking first; it is about striking in a manner that leaves the opponent minimal time or capacity to react, effectively nullifying their defensive postures. This introduces a dangerous paradigm wherein the traditional cushion of time provided by early warning systems is drastically reduced. For the United States, this might mean that even with the world's most advanced detection systems, the¬†[window to act](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45811/35)¬†could be so minimal that it might be rendered ineffective. As the United States and China jostle for dominance in this arena, the strategic significance of an elemental material, niobium, emerges as a pivotal concern, and with it, China‚Äôs rising dominance in the Western Hemisphere‚Äôs mining sector.

# Niobium: The Aerospace Marvel

Vacuum-grade niobium‚Äôs¬†[role](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/)¬†in aerospace is not a newfound revelation. Its unparalleled resilience against extreme thermal stresses, withstanding temperatures¬†[over 2,400 degrees Celsius,](https://www.domailleengineering.com/niobium-c103-unique-hypersonics/)¬†renders it indispensable for critical components in hypersonic vehicles. Beyond its inherent properties, niobium‚Äôs pivotal role lies in its use for crafting heat-resistant superalloys essential for hypersonic missiles and the broader aerospace sector. Its low density compared to other refractory metals contributes to a¬†[high strength-to-weight ratio](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/), which is essential for reducing the weight of aerospace components. This reduction in weight directly impacts fuel efficiency and payload capacity, two critical factors in aerospace design. For example, companies like¬†[SpaceX and Hermeus](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/)¬†depend on niobium C103 for their spacecrafts, which require extremely high temperatures that surpass that of other superalloys.

For decades, niobium has played a pivotal role in the U.S. aerospace industry, with its notable use in the innovative designs of the iconic¬†[Gemini and Apollo](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Apollo-15-CSM-in-lunar-orbit-with-the-dark-rocket-nozzle-made-from-niobium-titanium_fig1_329104474)¬†programs of the 1960s and 70s. However, despite its significance, the United States depends entirely on niobium imports, with no substantial domestic mining since¬†[1959](https://minedocs.com/19/USGS-Mineral-Commodity-Summaries-Niobium-January-2022.pdf). This reliance introduces a severe risk to its supply chain. Of the estimated¬†[8,800 metric tons](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/)¬†imported annually in 2022, a significant majority comes from¬†[Brazil (66 percent) and Canada (25 percent)](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/). This heavy reliance on just two primary sources‚Äîboth neighbors of the United States in the Western Hemisphere‚Äîexposes the United States to considerable national security and economic vulnerabilities. The situation becomes even more precarious considering China‚Äôs dominant position in the niobium sector and its growing footprint in the hemisphere.

China‚Äôs Stake in Brazil‚Äôs Mineral Monopoly

Brazil dominated global niobium production in 2020, accounting for over¬†[91 percent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316)¬†of production. With reserves estimated at¬†[842 million metric tons](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/), Brazil produces roughly¬†[120,000 metric tons annually](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/). Brazil‚Äôs high production comes from large mines such as¬†[Arax√° and Catal√£o](https://www.cradleresources.com.au/what-is-niobium/), with Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Minera√ß√£o (CBMM) controlling¬†[75 percent of Brazil‚Äôs output](https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/).

China has recognized the potential of niobium for over a decade. In 2011, a consortium of¬†[five Chinese companies](https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/)¬†acquired a 15 percent stake in CBMM. This engagement intensified in 2016 when China Molybdenum Co. Ltd. (now known only as CMOC) secured ownership of the¬†[Chapad√£o and Boa Vista mines](https://dialogochino.net/en/extractive-industries/25588-niobiums-silent-impact-in-brazil/), further strengthening China's position in the niobium market.

The importance of niobium was further highlighted in the Brazilian political arena in 2018. Then presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro emphasized niobium's role in Brazil's ‚Äú[economic independence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-china-niobium/hands-off-brazils-niobium-bolsonaro-sees-china-as-threat-to-utopian-vision-idUSKCN1MZ1JN/).‚Äù Despite Bolsonaro's campaign rhetoric focusing on safeguarding this critical commodity from foreign control and advocating for its national governance, Chinese influence in the Brazilian niobium sector continued to grow. By 2020, Chinese entities controlled approximately¬†[26 percent of Brazil's niobium production](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316). This control not only ensures China's preferential access and influence over pricing dynamics in the niobium supply chain, but also positions it advantageously in a global context.

China managed to maintain and even strengthen its position at the subnational level under Bolsonaro. CMOC for instance provided¬†[$1.2 million](https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/04/brazils-economic-ties-china-flourish-despite-political-shifts)¬†in Covid-19 aid to the city of Catal√£o, demonstrating China's strategic engagement beyond mere commercial interests.

China‚Äôs influence over Brazil‚Äôs niobium production conforms to a¬†[pattern](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2023/07/chinas-critical-mineral-model-latin-america/)¬†of growing ownership and sway over the regional mining industry, a trend with substantial environmental, political, and security implications. Such tactics could force nations into making diplomatic compromises, ceding trade advantages, or grappling with economic dilemmas, thereby solidifying China's geopolitical standing. The United States is not immune to this exposure; in 2022 the U.S. Geological Survey identified niobium as the¬†[second most critical of 50 minerals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316#bib0072), falling behind only gallium in its criticality to U.S. national security and economic growth.

# Defense Implications

China's hypersonic resolve has been remarkable. By 2018, it had¬†[conducted over 20 times](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/R45811.pdf)¬†as many tests as the United States. According to the Pentagon, the United States is¬†[still lagging.](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2023/04/18/pentagon-yes-we-are-still-lagging-behind-chinas-hypersonics/)¬†This hypersonic prowess, combined with China's stranglehold on niobium, places the United States in a perilous position.

The strategic importance of niobium in next-generation defense systems cannot be overstated. As the U.S. military and its defense contractors increasingly rely on niobium-based superalloys to produce a wide range of equipment, from aircraft components to hypersonic missile systems, any disruption in the niobium supply chain could have significant repercussions.

Overall, China's growing influence and control over critical mineral supply chains poses a distinct challenge. Under the Biden administration, the United States and the European Union placed export controls and restrictions on strategic and critical minerals to curb China‚Äôs dominance in¬†[artificial intelligence and semiconductors](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/what-to-make-of-chinas-latest-restrictions-on-critical-mineral-exports/). In retaliation, China imposed their own limitations on¬†[gallium, germanium](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-flexes-critical-metals-muscles-with-export-curbs-2023-07-10/), and¬†[graphite](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-require-export-permits-some-graphite-products-dec-1-2023-10-20/)¬†throughout 2023. A recent analysis by¬†[CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-graphite-restrictions#:~:text=China%20produces%2090%20percent%20of,90%20percent%20of%20global%20graphite.)¬†highlighted that China controls 90 percent of global gallium supplies, 90 percent of graphite, and 60 percent of germanium, all critical to the production of chips and electric vehicle batteries. The critical mineral supply chain has arrived at the forefront of strategic competition between the West and the People‚Äôs Republic of China.

China‚Äôs grip on the production, distribution, and pricing of niobium presents another layer of complexity: manipulating niobium‚Äôs availability to other nations. For the United States, already grappling with the challenges of overdependence on external sources for critical minerals, such a disruption could translate into significant production delays. The consequences could be serious: slower production of critical defense equipment, increased costs due to the potential need for alternative materials, and a cascading effect on existing machinery's maintenance and upgrade cycles. In this highly complex environment where timely responses to emerging threats are vital, these delays could hinder the United States' ability to promptly deploy or develop necessary defense systems.

# U.S. Countermeasures

Facing such formidable challenges, the United States cannot afford to remain a passive observer. Safeguarding its strategic interests and maintaining its global position demands a comprehensive and multifaceted critical mineral strategy, particularly in securing niobium supplies.

# Including Brazil in the MSP

Incorporating Brazil into the 13-nation¬†[Mineral Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership/)¬†(MSP) could significantly fortify the global niobium supply chain. The MSP represents a concerted multinational endeavor to develop environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards and bolster investments in critical mineral supply chains, an initiative that aligns well with the strategic interests of both Brazil and the broader international community. Brazil‚Äôs inclusion would make it the first Latin American country to enter the partnership, signaling its regional leadership and increase in international stature. The integration of Brazil into this partnership is particularly strategic, considering its substantial niobium reserves, in addition to its other critical mineral deposits. This move would add a robust layer of security against potential supply disruptions.

President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva's administration, with its strong emphasis on ESG standards, is likely to find the MSP's principles congruent with its¬†[policy priorities](https://dialogochino.net/en/climate-energy/363907-will-lula-be-brazils-environmental-saviour/). The MSP‚Äôs emphasis on elevating global standards in these areas could resonate with Lula‚Äôs progressive agenda, potentially making Brazil‚Äôs participation both beneficial and attractive.

Furthermore, Brazil's inclusion in the MSP would facilitate its adherence to a framework that advocates for the diversification and stabilization of mineral supply chains. This alignment could be instrumental in mitigating China‚Äôs dominant influence in the niobium market. By joining the MSP, Brazil would not only assert its role in the global mineral economy but also contribute to a more balanced and less vulnerable critical mineral supply landscape, including niobium.

# Diversification of Niobium Sources

# Diversifying niobium sources is a critical strategic concern. The current overreliance on a limited number of suppliers presents a significant vulnerability in the supply chain. This is not merely a matter of economic convenience but a pressing national security issue. The¬†[Elk Creek project](https://www.usgs.gov/data/niobium-deposits-united-states)¬†in Nebraska represents a commendable step toward addressing this vulnerability domestically. This initiative exemplifies how investment in local resources can contribute to a more resilient supply chain. Placing more emphasis on domestic production, the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act¬†[calls for domestic manufacturing of critical minerals](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/whats-in-the-fy2024-ndaa-for-critical-minerals/), and ‚Äúencourages DOD to review the need to utilize Defense Production Act authorities to establish domestic processing capacity of niobium, tantalum, and scandium.‚Äù

# However, to comprehensively mitigate the risks associated with niobium supply, the United States should extend its strategy beyond domestic projects. Engaging in international partnerships, especially with Canadian, African, and European nations that have niobium reserves, is crucial.

# Canada‚Äôs significant niobium reserves stands as an ideal partner to strengthen North American supply security. The geographical proximity of Canada to the United States offers logistical advantages, reducing transportation costs and environmental impact. Additionally, the strong political and economic ties between the United States and Canada could facilitate smoother bilateral agreements and joint ventures in niobium exploration and development.

# Africa‚Äôs rich mineral resources, and Europe‚Äôs advanced mining technologies and regulatory frameworks, offer promising avenues for collaboration. These partnerships could lead to the exploration and development of new niobium sources, thus diversifying the global supply chain.

# Stockpiling and Strategic Reserves

The practice of stockpiling and maintaining strategic reserves of strategic minerals serves as a crucial safeguard during times of geopolitical unrest or supply chain interruptions. Experts suggest that with its existing reserves of critical minerals, the United States may¬†[face challenges in sustaining](https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/the-u-s-government-should-stockpile-more-critical-minerals/)¬†a protracted conflict with China. The National Defense Stockpile (NDS), designed to support the nation's needs for up to¬†[four years](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833), is perceived by some as insufficient for the United States to execute its strategic military objectives effectively. Proactive measures to accumulate substantial reserves of niobium and other strategic minerals are imperative. While in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 Congress appropriated¬†[$218.5 million](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833)¬†for total NDS acquisitions, it remains at an unsatisfactory level to support the nation‚Äôs needs. Congress should place more effort in supporting the NDS in the future. Strategic stockpiling must be revitalized to Cold War-era levels so that the United States maintains its capability to meet both economic and defense production demands, even under challenging global scenarios.

# Conclusion

In the grand chessboard of defense geopolitics, niobium has emerged as a piece of paramount importance. The intertwining of mineral control and technological advancements underscores the multifaceted nature of modern security threats. For the United States, addressing this dual challenge is not just about catching up in the hypersonic race or diversifying niobium sources, but about reimagining its strategic approach in a complex global landscape‚Äîone where the Western Hemisphere takes center stage. Recognizing and mitigating these vulnerabilities will be crucial in ensuring U.S. national security in the face of strategic competition. The stakes are high, and the game is evolving; proactive measures today will dictate the balance of power tomorrow.

**The Defense Industrial Base (DIB) supply chains for rare earth element (REE) magnets are in a transition phase. ¬†Supported¬† by U.S. and partner nations, new sources of supply from raw materials to magnets are being developed around the globe.¬† By statute, effective January 1, 2026, restrictions on REE magnets will follow the supply chain to the mining tier.¬† Additionally, as early as June 2025, suppliers may be required to provide the full provenance of all REE magnets.**¬†

**This day and a half workshop will gather stakeholders from across the supply chain and U.S. Government to discuss challenges and opportunities in this critical supply chain.¬† A partnership between Government and companies within the DIB is required to accomplish changes in REE supply chains.¬† The provenance requirements for REE magnets will be a significant challenge, and new technologies and new approaches to organizing the market will be required to accomplish this requirement.¬† The Workshop will focus on the following topics and questions:**

* *What actions is the U.S. Government taking to incentivize new sources of supply throughout the supply chain?*
* *What tiers of the supply chain are highest risk for not being fully established prior to the sourcing restriction implementation deadline?*
* *What solutions would enable supply chain provenance to the mining level, and can these solutions be implemented by the June 23rd, 2025 provenance target date?*
* *What is the status of Government and Industry efforts to develop substitute magnets and new technologies?*
* *What additional support does the nascent U.S. and friendly nation rare earth element industry need to grow and thrive in the long-term?*

**Additional InformationRecently proposed Defense Acquisition Regulation Supplemental (DFARS) sourcing requirements (DFARS Case 2021-D015) have set a deadline of January 1st, 2026 for the entire DIB REE magnet supply chains, from mining to magnet production, to be produced outside of the covered countries of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), the Russian Federation, the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of North Korea, and¬†the Islamic Republic of Iran.**¬†

**Additionally, Section 857 of James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23 NDAA) (Public Law 117-263, signed December 23, 2022) contains provisions requiring disclosure by defense contractors of the sources of supply for rare earth elements (REE) and strategic and critical materials (SCM) within permanent magnets used in defense systems.**¬† 

**\*\*\*\*\*\*These provenance sourcing requirements will go into effect as early as June 23, 2025.¬† As the Department of Defense\*\*\[1\], Department of Commerce\[2\], and Department of Energy\[3\]\*\* and other government agencies have previously written, the PRC is the dominate global producer for all-tiers off the REE magnet supply chain.¬† Therefore, the DIB migrating to REE supply chains entirely separate from the PRC is less than straightforward.**

# DEC. 5th 2024~US scrambling to close hypersonic airpower gap with China

[US scrambling to close hypersonic airpower gap with China - Asia Times](https://asiatimes.com/2024/12/us-scrambling-to-close-hypersonic-airpower-gap-with-china/)

[The US Air Force's B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Image: X Screengrab](https://preview.redd.it/xqjzcuo0j97e1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1ad0e9a4d2f3f631863f35c62634945cd6db565)

A top US general has advocated for faster and greater production of the next-generation B-21 Raider bomber, a call to match China‚Äôs rapid airpower advancements and respond to fast-evolving threats. But an emerging hypersonic weapons gap may be shifting Asia‚Äôs airpower balance in China‚Äôs favor.

This month, FlightGlobal¬†[reported](https://mitchellaerospacepower.org/event/an-gen-thomas-a-bussiere/)¬†that US Air Force General Thomas Bussiere, commander of the Global Strike Command, has called for a reassessment of the planned fleet size of¬†[Northrop Grumman](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOC/)\-made B-21 Raider bombers.

Speaking at the¬†[Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies](https://mitchellaerospacepower.org/event/an-gen-thomas-a-bussiere/), Bussiere emphasized the critical role of the B-21 scheduled to replace the aging¬†[Boeing](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BA/)¬†B-1B and Northrop B-2 bombers. Bussiere described the B-21 as ‚Äúthe most exquisite weapons system ever built.‚Äù It is currently undergoing flight testing, with initial operational deployment expected in the mid-2020s.

The USAF‚Äôs current plan is to acquire 100 B-21s, but Bussiere suggests that this number may need to be increased to meet the demands of modern warfare and rising geopolitical challenges. He highlighted strong demand for the USAF‚Äôs bomber fleet, which includes the upgraded B-52J, noting their frequent deployment for combat operations and strategic deterrence.

Bussiere also pointed out that previous assessments indicated a need for 220 bombers, which may require revision in light of current security dynamics.

However, B-21 production challenges have resulted in a scaling down of the planned numbers of next-generation bombers, forcing the US to keep older bombers in service longer than originally scheduled.

In July 2024, Asia Times¬†[reported](https://asiatimes.com/2024/07/us-boosts-b-2-bombers-amid-b-21-production-delays/)¬†that the US Air Force had upgraded its B-2 Spirit stealth bombers with advanced software, enhancing their combat readiness amid delays in B-21 production.

The new open missions systems (OMS) software, developed in collaboration with the Air Force Global Strike Command and the B-2 Systems Program Office, significantly reduces update times from two years to less than three months, allowing for quicker integration of new weapons and continuous improvements.

***Article shortened....***

The ARRW, a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle (HGV), is designed to counter heavily defended, high-value targets but has faced repeated testing failures, leading to delays and budget cuts. The US Senate and House of Representatives eliminated $150 million requested for its continued development in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act.

Despite these setbacks, the program continues with planned flight tests, driven by rising concerns over China‚Äôs hypersonic capabilities. The US Air Force is also exploring air-breathing hypersonic weapons, such as the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC), which may offer more cost-effective and versatile solutions but have yet to be proven.

I struck up relationships with a few women. One I'll Dulce, the next Yvette, and the last one Miriam. I'd like to hope that I can maintain friendships with Dulce and Yvette because it quickly became clear that Miriam and I connected. Dulce didn't really hit it off , so I feel like I can talk to her in a direct way - but I can't be sure. We met for coffee twice and had some good conversations. She's smart and literary, my age, and fun to hang out with. I don't detect any signs that she's attracted to me. We've hugged maybe twice and there were no hints or indications that she wants more than that. That might be the easy part.

I started chatting with Yvette and Miriam at about the same time. Each one asked me to meet for a drink, and it just happened that plans with Yvette came together first. She's also smart, a teacher like me, but ten years younger than me. She and I have expressed some intimate thoughts and went for one long walk (5 hours) together. She held my upper arm most of the time. At the end of the walk, we hugged. As I pulled away, she leaned back and kissed me twice briefly- pecks, really. Afterward, she apologized for moving our ""friendship"" too quicklyI accepted that she's not ready to move things from that friendship level but asked her to explain what she's looking for in general and what she's looking for from this relationship. She hasn't gotten back to me on either even though I've asked two or three times. I was starting to feel something more affectionate and even romantic towards her--just a little bit.

That's when I went out with Miriam. We hit it off immediately and agreed that we could refer to our first meet-up as a date. In addition to several lengthy phone calls, I've now gone on dates with her three nights in a row, each time for 5-6 hours and each time ending with some degree of, um, physical activity. We've agreed to make this an exclusive relationship, and I've deleted my various dating profiles.

I don't know how to explain to Yvette that I'm no longer interested in pursuing a romantic relationship. Like I said before, I'd like to protect the friendship - not to keep her in reserve in case Miriam and I don't work out - but because, as with Dulce, I like her and enjoy hanging out with her.

All of that has made me well prepared for my interview today. I‚Äôm writing this like others did before me - in hopes it will help a fellow immigrant. 
I had my interview this morning at the US embassy in London. I live in London so I didn‚Äôt have to stay at a hotel or take a long journey to get there. So I arrived roughly an hour before my actual interview. The line to the embassy was extremely long but I knew to ignore it and just head straight to the security guard by the checkpoint. I informed him that I had a spousal green card interview at 10. He advised for me to come back at 9:30 and just head straight - he stuck some paper on my passport with the time of my interview. 
I went to a nearby coffee shop and sat there for 20 minutes and headed back to the embassy. I went straight in to an airport style entrance. I took off my belt, coat and everything in my pocket plus bag. Went through the metal detector and once I got my bags the guy asked if I had water and I replied yes- he instructed me to drink it just to make sure it wasn‚Äôt anything suspicious. 
After that, I went to a next building where there was also a long queue- I ignored this too and went inside (cue dirty looks from the people who were waiting) it was like a snake-like queue at the airport. 
I went through the American line because there was no way through to the reception and the only way to get there was through the American line. I unfortunately had to cut through people (I felt so rude and embarrassed throughout the whole cutting-the-line- situation because my British self couldn‚Äôt comprehend that cardinal sin). A security officer asked me what my interview was and I just showed the sticker on my passport and he immediately gave me a ticket and told me to follow the instructions on the sticker. 
I went one level up and turned left from windows 20-24. 
As soon as I sat down, my number was called immediately and I went to the booth with my documents. I handed all my civil documents and they took my fingerprints and told me to go sit down and wait for my number to be called back again for the interview. I waited for a whole HOUR! At this point I met an elderly lady from Zimbabwe who was sponsored by her son but she had been asked for his birth certificate which she didn‚Äôt have the original only a copy - she was given the infamous green slip which I had been dreading on getting it myself.
My belly was hurting, anxiety has gotten to me. I saw some people leaving and crying and I just prayed and prayed.
My number appeared in the screen and my heart skipped a beat. I immediately headed to the booth and I met an American officer who asked me to swear an oath of honesty. I was only asked few questions:
1- Where and When did you meet your husband?
2- Were you previously married, was he previously married?
3- Do you have any children together?
4- Has he visited you since you‚Äôve been married?
5- Was all the visitation in the UK?
6- Have you been to the US? 

I answered all of them comfortably and the officer was so lovely and friendly - we even had a few moments of banter where he wasn‚Äôt able to sneeze and told him to look at a light and he giggled. 

After all that, he told me congratulations- you are approved. We will issue your visa and send your passport in few days. Do you have any questions for me? I said no but I thanked him for his time and wished him happy holidays. 

We decided to leave to the US end of March to make sure it is after our 2nd year anniversary so we can get the 10 year visa because I do not want the mental hardships of removing conditions. 

One thing I can take from this, the interview is so underwhelming and make sure you bring any and every little document you can get and please make sure they‚Äôre all original or at least certified copy because 221g is also a nightmare. 

Ask me any questions you have, I‚Äôm just so glad our 1.9 year of visa journey is over!

My goal with this Youtube channel is to showcase the reality if making espresso, some day's your not going to have the perfect dial, some day's your milk texture is not going to be perfect, but it is the process of learning and finding what works best for you. I am not an expert nor I want to be, I am an everyday person like you that loves coffee.

I don't have time to sit behind a computer and edit a 3 min clip for 3 plus hours. I live a normal life, I have a 9-5. The best I can do is put my phone on a tripod, hit record and slap a filter.

>I have a close online friend that's gotten me a crazy amt of games over the past few months and I've been trying to come up with ideas for something to give in return - but I don't really have much money.

>I'm pulling my hair out trying to figure out what to get my sister. She is 34, mother of two (2 and 7), her partner travels for work and is gone for weeks at a time. She is currently off work for some health reasons, but is doing fine financially. They have listed their home for sale so they can move elsewhere closer to me and the rest of the family. She likes to game a little bit, but rarely gets to as she's busy with the kids. They like to cook, but have any kitchen gadet you can think of and more than enough knives, and they are always on different diets so I wouldn't want to get something that would be useless if/when their diet changed again. A lot of the time if there is something they want, they just go buy it.

>I'm a fairly techy person so my mind always goes to tech stuff like smart home systems like the Philips hue smart lights. They're not, they don't even own a computer. they are paranoid about home assistants ""listening"" so I am not sure how much they would like or use smart home lighting.

>This can be a gift for her or a gift to her and her partner, ideally its something they could both get use out of and appreciate but if its just for her that's fine too. He is a couple years older than she is (37).

>Couple of things I am going to just say are off limits as I've seen these suggested a thousand times and are not new.

>no gift cards, certificates, ""experiences"" I want to get her something that she can actually open and have in front of her on Christmas.

>no ""self care"" stuff. she wont use it, it will sit there and collect dust. She still has some self care kits that other family has bought her from previous years (years, plural)

>Nothing fashion or style related, one because she's not big into makeup, fancy clothing or jewelry, and I have no fashion sense whatsoever.

>no sentimental things, she's not a sentimental person. I don't want to just get her a framed photo, I want something she will enjoy.

>she doesn't really have much for hobbies, such is the lift of a mom who is raising her kids mostly on her own besides when her partner is home for a week every other month. So I have no clue and am just at my wits end trying to figure something out. HELP ME.

We‚Äôre mostly about 2 years apart from each other. The two youngest are minors, so this doesn‚Äôt apply to them. The three who ask for money are my sisters, two of whom I was very close with growing up.

I never really hear from them anymore unless they want something and it‚Äôs honestly depressing. I don‚Äôt need them to throw me a parade but just coming by to see me just to see me once in a while would be nice. Just stop by one day for a cup of coffee. It doesn‚Äôt have to be supremely long. I just want to know you still like your older brother and you‚Äôre not just seeing me as a walking fucking ATM. Because this is depressing. Genuinely. Like a petty side of me wants to blow off Christmas just so one of them will ask where I am. But like‚Ä¶ would they even? 

I don‚Äôt even earn that much more than my siblings, I‚Äôm just more responsible with my income and I guess a sap who‚Äôs still willing to help them out if they need it. Two of the three have kids so if I don‚Äôt help them it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm letting my nieces and nephews down too. 

This just feels like shit. My nieces and nephews show me more affection in an afternoon than all my siblings show me throughout the fucking year. 

And they see each other independently of me. Like my sisters will go see each other, they just don‚Äôt really stop by to see me unless they need something from me. ",2,1734377661.0,self,0,1.0,False

So weeks go by, we talk and flirt. Then he replies to
my story at a cafe with a cup of coffee, with a coffee emoji. So I said ""let's go for coffee sometime"" he replied saying ""is that your way of asking me out?"". Then he asked if I really wanted to see him, to which I said yes. He replied saying he wanted to see me too. 

Then, he never initiated anything and said ""weekends"" when I asked when he's usually free. So the week after, I asked him ""are you still down to get coffee this weekend?"" then he replied saying ""where and when :)?"" I told him all the details, he just replied saying ""can I let you know tomorrow maybe?"".
So I decided not to wait around and to follow up with other plans with friends. I told him ""I'll have to reschedule, no worries :)""

Picture this: you‚Äôre standing in line at your favorite coffee shop, ready to pay with Bitcoin. The barista smiles, your latte is steaming, and life is good. But then‚Ä¶ the dreaded pending transaction screen pops up. Your Bitcoin is stuck in the digital abyss, caught in the web of blockchain congestion. Cue the groans, eye rolls, and awkward explanations to the person behind you.

Enter **Bitcoin Jumper** ‚Äî the superhero of stuck Bitcoin transactions. This nifty app doesn‚Äôt just accelerate transactions; it *zooms* them to the finish line like a caffeinated sprinter in a blockchain relay. Say goodbye to transaction limbo and hello to financial freedom. üöÄ

Here‚Äôs why Bitcoin Jumper is your new best friend and how it can make your crypto life as smooth as your favorite cold brew.

# What Is Bitcoin Jumper?

Bitcoin Jumper is your go-to solution for accelerating Bitcoin transactions. Whether you‚Äôre dealing with network congestion or low transaction fees slowing things down, Bitcoin Jumper steps in to fast-track your payments.

[Check out Bitcoin Jumper here!](https://www.bitcoinjumper.com)

# Why Do Bitcoin Transactions Get Stuck?

Before we dive into the juicy details of Bitcoin Jumper, let‚Äôs take a quick look at why Bitcoin transactions sometimes get stuck in the first place. It‚Äôs not because the blockchain hates you (promise). It‚Äôs usually one of these culprits:

1. **Low Transaction Fees**: Miners prioritize transactions with higher fees. If your fee is on the low side, your transaction might end up in the digital equivalent of a waiting room.
2. **Network Congestion**: When the blockchain gets busy (think Black Friday at the mall), transactions can pile up like cars in a traffic jam.
3. **Mempool Madness**: The mempool is where unconfirmed transactions wait their turn. If it‚Äôs crowded, your transaction might take longer to process.

Sound familiar? Don‚Äôt worry, Bitcoin Jumper is here to save the day.

# How Does Bitcoin Jumper Work?

Using Bitcoin Jumper is as easy as 1-2-3. Here‚Äôs the lowdown:

1. **Enter Your Transaction Details**: Provide the transaction ID (TXID) of the stuck payment. This helps Bitcoin Jumper locate your digital needle in the blockchain haystack.
2. **Let Bitcoin Jumper Do Its Thing**: The app works its magic, boosting your transaction and giving it the priority it deserves. No need to beg miners or perform blockchain voodoo.
3. **Sit Back and Relax**: Watch as your transaction zooms through the network faster than you can say ‚Äúblock height.‚Äù

And just like that, you‚Äôre back in the fast lane.

1hfr0s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateDevelopment/comments/1hfr0s6/project_manager_vs_acquisitions_track/,Project Manager vs Acquisitions Track,"I have worked for a medium-sized RE development firm for 7 years with three years as a mid-level manager. My background is pretty varied (architecture, PE fund raising, finance, BD+C sales/marketing) and I became the preferred choice for a PM role that opened up about 3 years ago.

Fundamentally I function as a PM, but I have a ton of other responsibilities. I help with underwriting, make test fits, and write entire investment memos. I also make neighborhood presentations, handle entitlements, handle design and construction oversight (with the help of a very experienced CM). I am doing financial analysis and operations as well, with obvious input from the PICs. I would call it a B-Z role, with the A being handled by a peer of mine who has the same title as me but considered ""the acquisition guy.""

For underwriting it feels more like I report (laterally) to that person who then get's credit for my work. They originate some(but not all) of the deals, handle the LOI, lead underwriting and are good at their job, but I end up doing a lot of work to get the deals ready. When I have asked how I can get more directly involved in deal making and fund raising for career trajectory, there are some ""sure, maybe on the next one!"" but those meeting invites just never seem to materialize.

On one hand my job very fulfilling, but I'm questioning whether this job is a path to the type of wealth I aspire to. I can invest in our deals but it's out of pocket so it hurts my liquidity. I don't get any pref. and my bonus isn't really tied any specific metric. When deals go well, the originator + PIC gets a lot of credit. When deals go poorly, I get blamed. I'm managing a LOT of jobs at once, far more than any peer I've spoken to in the industry. My calendar is filled with hours of fixing problems, whereas the deal guy gets coffee and networks as a major part of his job...frankly I'm a little jealous.

The best thing I can say about the job is that I have two partner mentors who I have a lot of loyalty to. They have taught me a ton and if it weren't for them, I'd have left ages ago.

I know this sub isn't my diary, but I thought I'd just ask if anyone at a small/medium shop can provide some guidance on how to conceptualize my future in a small shop where growth is somewhat limited and when the industry sees a clear divide between acquisitions/deal making and PM with basically no in-between. My job includes a multitude of responsibilities that I'm not sure the industry values because they don't fit the mold of a PM.

TL;DR - I do far more than a typical PM while simultaneously discouraged from going deeper into acquisitions, and worry that long term I'll just be seen as a ""PM with some useless skills"" as my career evolves. I have done some proactive things, but haven't gotten the results I hoped for.

It‚Äôs probably important to note that we have been talking for about 10 months solely long distance and we‚Äôve left each other on open maybe 3-4 times and most times it ends with a ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to you later‚Äù the next morning I decided I should probably initiate a conversation since I never responded (by ofc my bpd brain was really hoping he‚Äôd do it anyways bc that would prove he wanted to talk, but still you know no big deal) and he replied back like normal and we chatted a bit just asking how the other was and plans for the day and then conversation became a little more spread out as I was busy but we still continued light conversation through the morning and there was some playful flirting like usual from his end and me reciprocating. Then at some point he just replied to one of my messages with ‚ÄúüòÇ‚Äù again so my brain was like he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to you. So instead of just leaving him on opened I figured I‚Äôd give him the chance and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you go so you can clean and get more coffee‚Äù and he responded with just that his coffee was gone and asked what I was up to so I was like okay he could of said see ya later but he continued the conversation until he had to go for the day (which is normal) the last thing I said was ‚Äúdrive safe!‚Äù I figured I might not hear from him for a day or so bc he‚Äôs been very busy at work with the holidays and family (he is 6 hours ahead of me time wise) but when I opened Snap it said he had opened it. Now that alone probably wouldn‚Äôt have sent me into a spiral but that paired with me feeling like a monster and him not wanting to talk to me did. So it was 230 am and I start crying and spiraling for the first time in almost a month. And since then I‚Äôve done everything to be alone in this parking lot crying. Going through dissociative states to back to hyperventilating crying, to feeling okay for like 5 mins. 

Logically I know we are probably fine (I‚Äôve gone over everything and it‚Äôs not like we had any issue or fight) I‚Äôve even gone as far as some have suggested and talked to chat gbt or whatever it is and it put a lot of logic into it as well but I just feel like if I lose this I‚Äôll be nothing. And that‚Äôs terrifying to me. I know this is part of bpd and logical me knows to try to stay busy and that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm loved‚Äù and more than what he makes me but the other part of me can‚Äôt stand the thought of my life without him. It‚Äôs all ridiculous and I feel embarrassed to be 30 years old and be this way. Also we are not in a relationship but I would describe it as a virtual Fwb kind of thing. And yes my psychiatrist knows about this and I try my best to be open with the people closest to me but it‚Äôs hard bc I‚Äôm so so embarrassed by it and I‚Äôm bad at even knowing how to verbalize it. 

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm looking for with this I‚Äôm just feeling so shitty and that was making progress but I‚Äôve just been shown that there isn‚Äôt really any way out of this. ",3,1734376426.0,BorderlinePDisorder,2,1.0,False

1hfquh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1hfquh9/i_know_im_exagerating_but_i_feel_devastated_it_is/,"I know I'm exagerating, but I feel devastated, it is what it is","I've just discovered the word 'limerence' and consequently this subreddit... Hello everyone!  
before I was only conscious of my brutal OCD diagnosis.

I have a short story to tell and a question to ask at the end.   
Let's start.  
  
1 year and a half ago, after recovering from the breakup of an 8-year relationship, I(35m) met this girl(32f) at the gym, and we used to follow the same HIIT course. I noticed she was gazing at me every time I arrived at the course, and she started smiling once I began to greet her. We started to talk to each other before the start of the course and I can clearly affirm that we had a connection.

After talking 2 times, she disappeared (I will discover in the future that it was because she changed her job that forced her to follow an unsuitable schedule with that course).  
Anyway, I probably made the error of investing too much in the connection we had (As mentioned, I suffer from brutal OCD, so maybe that has been one of the reasons). So I decided to find her on FB and contact her after some weeks.

As many of you would say, it was a huge mistake, in fact, she replied but was cold af. I asked her to go outside for a coffee but she replied saying that she would have preferred to meet at the gym. So she informed me about her new gym schedule and I started to follow some courses just to meet her (insert facepalm here).  
I noticed that she was a bit colder than before, but she wanted to continue to see me, she always came to my place while finding me at the gym, and always wanted to talk... But just that, the situation became stale.

Every time I wrote her on FB she was always super cold (two or three lines of text at maximum). I decided to follow her on Instagram, and she accepted my request but never followed me back, and this was quite devastating. And also through IG I discovered she has a boyfriend, with which she's living (She never mentioned her boyfriend to me).  
I decided to go nuclear saying that I would never want to meet her again while deleting her on all the social media, she was sad but accepted my decision.

It's absurd, I had also another girlfriend in the meantime, but it took months to forget about her. Last week she appeared in my ""people you may know"" section of FB, so I know she could have visited my profile and this triggered my obsession with her just like a year ago. I tried contacting her to ask how her life was going, but, as you can guess, I got ghosted.

I know it could appear absurd in your eyes since I've never had a romantic relationship with this girl, but it is what it is. I felt a connection at the beginning that I'd never experienced in years, but probably she was only seeking attention at the gym...I feel bad about investing this amount of energy in her, but again, it is what it is. I feel I have no control. It's sad to admit that but social media impacted too much on this.

Since my last relationship lasted 8 years, it was a long time since I've experienced this kind of feeling. I don't know how to handle it, my mind goes to that all day, and remaining concentrated on my daily stuff it's actually a nightmare. Do you have any suggestions to break this neurosis? It's completely out of hand. Actually, I'm taking some mood stabilizers that my psychiatrist prescribed but they are not really effective against the neurosis.",3,1734376294.0,limerence,0,0.8,False

**Basic info about me:**

31M (but questioning gender)

long-term volunteer, currently employed for a bit to put some bucks in the travel savings pillow

been described as chill, patient, maybe with a bit odd maneurisms and vernacular, can get quite goofy at times as well.

am a bit introverted but can open up quite fast.

vegan for 11+years, don't drink alcohol, don't like weed or being around it, however am a bit addicted to coffee/caffeine. 

politically aware/active, 
respect and wellbeing for all!

i like nature (uhh, how much more generic and vague can this get?), swimming in natural bodies of water in any season, and sauna.
i am interested in quite a broad range of topics, also depends on my current hyperfixation.

**Basic info about the trip:**

Pretty flexible, my pass is for 10 days within 2 months and I gotta use it in the following 11 months.
Ideally I would start mid-summer (end of July) with the northbound leg/loop of the trip.

I would like to go all the way South - Spain and Portugal (as far as currently possible with trains) as well as all the way North - Scandinavia (and then make a 'loop').
 Oh, and if you are from one of the iberian countries or scandinavian, do hit me up as well!
I am also strongly considering the Balkans, but it might be worth it to not even use travel days there (or use maybe 1 or 2).

It is possible to ""tag along"" for just a part of the trip. For a week or two.  Indeed, 2 months together can be a bit daunting commitment to make!
I would like to find some sort of a volunteering stay/workaway or two.

Ideally I would start the trip in August, but I am open to an earlier or later start, with good company.
Staying overnight would be as low cost as possible - night trains, hostels and/or campsites (TBD). Or even couchsurfing and its numerous alternatives.

**A little bit about you:**

Ideally vegan OR enthusiastic about trying out vegan dishes in various venues along the way, of course I still wanna keep it lowcost, but this is one of my joys while travelling. 
If not vegan, willing to take on the ""challenge"" of not using/consuming animals while travelling with me; with no judgement if it fails. I've been in places with very limited options (think rural France, Corsica..), and I can usually figure something out and help others as well.

Enjoying a beer here and there (not every day) or being an occassional smoker is not an issue for me, neither is weed, but in that regard I would only ask to keep the (weed) smoke far away from me. 

Gender doesn't matter. 

We can chat a bit and see if we vibe, also learn some more about eachother and perhaps schedule a videocall. If you're in the NL in the next few months, we can also meet in person.",1,1734376269.0,Interrail,0,1.0,False

We spent some time speaking then i excused my self to take a shower and leave .

On her 35th birthday, Taylor Swift gifted us an Easter egg hunt in the form of new/old behind-the-scenes (BTS) videos from some of her directed music videos. These videos were originally played before the Eras Tour. Every video focuses on Taylor's role as a **director**. They feature her predominantly directing shots, actors, and cues and include the actors' commentaries on Taylor's directorial skills and style. It's important to note that these were exclusive to Eras before the tour officially ended, serving as important context (I believe) for Eras itself. 

Why, you ask? The true final song of Eras is ""Mastermind"" before the encore/curtain call of ""Karma."" Taylor calls back to her earlier ""powers"" that she discovers during the *Lover* era before she sings ""The Man,"" directing the dancers into a self-explained checkmate during ""Mastermind"" just as she directed the crowd to scream on cue earlier. Despite being the star, she is also directing the crowd and those around her. All the world is a stage. Performanceartlors, rise. 

https://preview.redd.it/5g486hlz497e1.png?width=1610&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac727ef8b0df7ff3b4c5df14ea58e4c37199cbfd

There is an extensive focus on Taylor as a director in her TIME POY interview. Taylor references several movies, including *Gladiator, The Lord of the Rings, Avengers, Barbie*, and *The Phantom Thread,* the ending of which inspires ""Mastermind."" Just like the BTS videos, famous directors speak highly of Taylor, specifically Greta Gerwig and Shonda Rhimes. 

* Greta Gerwig: ‚ÄúHer work as a songwriter is what speaks most clearly to me. To write music that is from the deepest part of herself and have it directly speak into the souls of other people.‚Äù // ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a sucker for a gal who is good with words, and she is the best with them. \[She is\] Bruce Springsteen meets Loretta Lynn meets Bob Dylan.‚Äù
* Shonda Rhimes: ""She controls narrative not only in her work but in her life. It used to feel like people were taking shots at her. Now it feels like she‚Äôs providing the narrative‚Äîso there aren‚Äôt any shots to be taken.‚Äù

It has never been lost on me that the focus of this piece was squarely about Taylor's ability to control a narrative interspersed with Easter eggs about her filmmaking future, what lies ahead for *reputation (Taylor's Version)*, and, more covertly, exactly what *TTPD* was about. Taylor's work during Eras laid more groundwork for this, creating an even grander stage for her performance art, its eventual plot twist, and the grand finale. She also pointed us to this date during her Spotify pop-up for *TTPD*. 

In this piece, I will share what I think are the most important ""new"" findings from the BTS videos and what I think some of the greater context or meaning might be. I wrote a piece on [Tortured Poets as a retrospective on Taylor's earlier life](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1h4e73m/essay_ttpd_is_entirely_a_reflection_on_the_events/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), specifically *Red* through *reputation*, which I'll reference in this piece extensively. I would encourage you to read it first if you haven't already!

In this video, Taylor explains the forest and sea metaphors. Taylor discovered the original beautiful forest world with the piano upon her initial escape (see *Lover*). She follows the glittering light thinking it will take her somewhere more beautiful, but she ends up lost at sea instead.

>Instead of going somewhere amazing, I go into a terrible situation where I'm floating in the middle of the ocean with only a piano to help me, sort of like the 'Jack's door' from \[*Titanic*\].

I imagine this to be a metaphor for her leaving her label, the beautiful place something like the ""new house"" she was placing daydreams in as in ""Cassandra."" What followed was the metaphorical shipwreck of ""evermore"" that left the subject of ""Peter"" unable to return home: the masters' heist. She likens the piano to ""Jack's door"" from *Titanic*, furthering the shipwreck motif of *folklore* and *evermore* as life-saving devices in the aftermath of *Lover* and her masters' heist.

According to Taylor in the BTS, the audience is meant to think the storm and body of water are not as immense as they are. (Taylor on the reaction she's seeking to evoke from the audience: ""And you're like, 'Holy shit, it's a whole ocean."") The reveal of the ocean is meant to convey the enormity of what she is metaphorically wethering. **What she went through is larger than what we perceived it to be.** She conveys as much in the TIME POY interview when discussing her cancellation, calling it a ""manufactured frame job"" meant to take her career from her. This part is notable to me because she cues the long shot during the lyrics about her youth, a huge theme of *Tortured Poets*. 

# Midnights 

When Midnights was first released, we only saw BTS footage from ""Lavender Haze."" I think it's interesting that we got a look behind the curtain of the only song that is specifically about Taylor wishing to remain hidden or in a haze. 

With this release, enter ""Bejeweled,"" ""Anti-Hero,"" and ""Karma"" featuring Ice Spice. 

**""Bejeweled"" BTS:** [**Laura Dern**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-8dOw7yuPo) **|** [**HAIM, Jack, and Pat McGrath**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAtpbCEsJlA) **|** [**Dita von Teese**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GeyBM6NS5s)

With Laura Dern, she makes fun of women being fixated on getting married and the cultural obsession with men in addition to getting incredible accolades from an Oscar-winning actress. Is it a coincidence that Laura Dern won an Oscar for her work in *Marriage Story*, a movie Taylor specifically references as having inspired the *All Too Well: Short Film*? 

With Pat McGrath, she explicitly directs that the queen is giving her approval of the **performance**. The talent show, which I can only imagine to be Eras, is complete with a clock reference. *Strings tied to levers / Slowed down clocks tethered / All this showmanship to keep it from you / In sweetness*. With Dita von Teese, Taylor has an immense appreciation for Dita's artistry. I think this gets to the heart of Taylor's lyrics in ""Mastermind"": *You see, all the wisest women had to do it this way.*

There are heavy *Speak Now* Easter eggs in this entire video, including Taylor's **SN** hairclips that are eventually replaced by **TS** in the final scene where she wins the castle. The room where Taylor learns to perform is the same purple haze of ""Lavender Haze"" and *Speak Now*, ""Enchanted"" in particular, on Eras. We get instrumental versions of ""Enchanted"" and ""Long Live"" to bookend the video respectively. I think there's more to it than just Easter egging the next re-recording: **""Bejewled"" is about the process of leaving her label that was purposefully harming and discarding her by beating them at their own game.** 

Finally, I know the thing that's gotten the most attention with this set of videos is Taylor's phone lock screen featuring a photo of her and Joe. I think this serves as her way of blatantly stating that ""Bejeweled"" is not about her relationship with Joe or any man for that matter: It's about her label and the industry, a reference to the elephant graveyard she says they discard popstars in when they're 35. *Hmmm... Don't put her in the basement, alright?!*

**""Anti-Hero"" BTS:** [**Funeral**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ddfFsLHNQs) **|** [**Ghosts**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0haCYjysUs)

We got two looks behind the curtain for ""Anti-Hero."" These seem to mainly focus on Taylor as a director, zooming in on the way she designed certain shots, including alternative shots, and heavy emphasis on her writing the script and screenplay per the actors. 

I think the 'Funeral' BTS serves mostly to showcase Taylor's directorial skill and style, plus her vision for executing her self-written script and how she cued all the timing for all the actors. (She really does know how to execute a vision.)

The 'Ghosts' BTS tells us a lot more. First, the title shot features a clock, but it's oriented clockwise, striking midnight at the same angle Taylor's watch chokers have been for the *Tortured Poets* era. The storytelling is linked, and this makes it obvious to me. I talk a lot in the piece I reference in the intro about how much *Midnights* is about the sleepless nights referenced in *TTPD*. We're looking backward in time to move forward. 

https://preview.redd.it/7l3bhzbys37e1.png?width=2078&format=png&auto=webp&s=55a9ca9bfc4fb2c045c5e5e6f1b0330bd6439052

We also get a glimpse at the coffee table book, which I extensively researched to identify as *Picasso Portraits* (2016). Seriously, this was so difficult to identify and I am so happy I get to bring it to you.

https://preview.redd.it/g0u4dmzl547e1.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b6112838e51a05cb3cd42d6e5a466a40db9df1

Here's an excerpt from the description of *Picasso Portraits* with the **bolded text** as that resonates with me when it comes to Taylor's descriptions of her work as things that happened to her, feelings she had for a few seconds, or things she made up in her imagination per her speech during the *Lover* era on the Eras Tour. 

>These dizzying stylistic shifts of Picasso‚Äôs long career can be traced through their manifestations in his portraits.¬†*Picasso Portraits*¬†tells this story thematically, with a focus on Picasso‚Äôs creative process rather than his biography. Issues addressed in depth in this volume include Picasso‚Äôs exploitation of familiar poses and formats, his sources of inspiration among the Old Masters and **the relationship between observation, memory and fantasy**.

I'll always be curious about the [artwork](https://www.juliensauctions.com/en/lots/315690/taylor-swift-anti-hero-music-video-used-original-artwork-anti-hero-mv) displayed on the wall behind the couch. I'm not able to find the artist like you can for the other piece behind Big Taylor in the dining room scene, and I can't make out what the expressionism is here, though the art reference given its adjacency to the Picasso book is surely intentional. Art critics welcome.

Of course, there's also the portrait of Taylor with her 11 ~~albums~~ cats that has always symbolized the number of studio albums (owned or not) at the time of her death. Whether this tells us anything about when the metaphorical funeral occurs (i.e., Is it after *Tortured Poets*, or after she owns all 11?), is also something I think time will tell. 

[**""Karma"" BTS**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwK7hrDC5UM)

The most interesting thing here is that Taylor says the steps that she ascends with Ice Spice are leading to ""heaven."" Here, she is even further above the clouds of ""Lavender Haze,"" marching beyond the faux walls of the false home to something bigger. She lassoes planets among the constellations, something she Easter egged earlier in the ""Lavender Haze"" music video on a vinyl cover for ""Mastermind."" Could she be reaching the lunar valleys she once dreamt of in ""I Hate It Here""?

https://preview.redd.it/u4ckslppp37e1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e6554a3ca869c380d2138643e2bbc005e19456c

To me, there's something deeper here when we think about the amount of faux heaven imagery she paints, especially in *Tortured Poets*. There are the false impressionist paintings of ""loml"" and the entire 'In Summation' poem describes a false heaven: manmade galaxies, stars glued to the ceiling, and a false sky that was torn down. I'm reminded of her cage imagery and *The Truman Show* here, the idea that the sky she looked up at was never real. She talks about being starry-eyed in so many songs, but were her eyes full of real stars, or false ones? 

We see a lot of Taylor's journey in ""Karma"" from the yellow brick road to her ferrying Ice across what seems to be the River Styx, but ascending to heaven in the face of her religious trauma is the final destination. What that means remains lost on me, but I would love your thoughts.

# Speak Now (Taylor's Version)

[**""I Can See You"" BTS**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFzzgQ7uCw4&list=PLINj2JJM1jxNmhTnJZH_608EC6OPdHB4j&index=17)

She's in a prison cell, she's been there for 12-13 years (the time between the original *Speak Now* release and its re-recording), and she is frozen in time at a museum that seems to capitalize on her while holding her hostage. *Hmmm... This sounds a lot like the music industry...*

Of course, the prison imagery of *Tortured Poets* is expansive. She escapes from prison in ""Fresh Out the Slammer,"" she is shackled in a room being forced to ""forget him"" in the MV for ""Fortnight,"" and the cell they filled with snakes in ""Cassandra."" In my analysis linked in the introduction, I've connected the prison imagery to her record label, not a romantic relationship. 

# The Tortured Poets Department

[**""Fortnight"" BTS** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w04K8z_nfDI)

This is the second BTS video we've gotten from ""Fortnight."" I've been obsessed with what Taylor's vision for the video might have been ever since her Instagram post about it representing all the different corners of the album, not just ""Fortnight"" the song.

In the first BTS video with Post Malone, we learn that he plays the tortured, tragic hero. The world where they are together, free from tattoos and able to touch each other, is fake‚Äîa figment of Taylor's imagination. Post appears to be an apprentice in the department, a government municipal building where they experiment on poets. We also know from the *TTPD* Timetable video that this department is adjacent to where *Midnights* exists: it's right next door in the same building. 

In the newest video, Taylor specifically says that there is a scientific study being conducted to measure the effect of **stimuli** on her poetry. I know Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles are riffing on their roles in the music video, but I think it's interesting they chose to keep it. They describe themselves as researchers who have been doing this‚Äîadministering pain to poets‚Äîfor a long time with the belief that the more painful torture the poet endures, the greater her poetry. *Then say they didn't do it to hurt me, but what if they did?* It also sounds exactly like the plot of ""Robin.""

https://preview.redd.it/vhncdn20497e1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4945b06fbe71967f2e72cddbef89f81273075ae

This BTS video confirms many of my theories around *Tortured Poets* as telling about the insidious nature of Taylor's time in the industry, especially between *Speak Now* & *Red* through *reputation*. I think it's not an accident that the youngest chronological version of Taylor‚Äîthe one with the wild *Fearless* curls and Romeo shirt dress in the 'Exam Room' being experimented on‚Äîlooks most like her younger self. She gets older and more tortured, symbolized by changes to her makeup and hair from rebellion (see the chained, hairpinned version of her with tattoos under her makeup) to mourning. 

There's also something interesting to me about the *Fearless* room on Eras and in the ""Lover"" music video is the only one that has seats on the ceiling, looking more like *Tortured Poets* than any of the other rooms. If you look back at the Anti-Hero BTS title card, it's also reminiscent of the orange Lover room for *Fearless* where everything is upside down. I think the allusions to the *Fearless* era and Taylor continuing to wear the color yellow throughout the house (in the *1989* fishbowl, at the NYE party in the *Red* room, etc.) are symbols of her youth and the daylight she was kept from as she was imprisoned. There's more of the faux house and heaven analysis to be done here.

**PS:** It's worth noting that, at the time of writing this post, the ""Lover"" MV BTS has not yet been uploaded although it was included in the teaser. It is unclear whether this was an error or an intentional choice. Time will tell. I'll update this if/when we get it. ",6,1734375788.0,GaylorSwift,3,0.8,False

==================================

When we think about our beloved pets, one of the last things that crosses our minds is bad breath. Yet, if you've ever leaned in to give your older dog a smooch, you might have recoiled in horror at the unmistakable whiff of something less than pleasant. But why do older dogs have bad breath? It‚Äôs a question that many pet owners find themselves pondering, and the answer can be a bit more complex than you might expect. As dogs age, their bodies undergo various changes‚Äîjust like us humans! These changes can lead to a world of dental issues, health problems, and even dietary adjustments that might contribute to those dreaded canine halitosis symptoms.

In this article, we'll dig deep into the causes of bad breath in older dogs, explore the potential health implications, discuss how to tackle this issue, and provide some tips on maintaining your furry friend's oral hygiene. So, grab a cup of coffee, curl up with your pooch, and let‚Äôs embark on this informative journey together!

Understanding Canine Halitosis: An Overview
-------------------------------------------

Before diving headfirst into the particulars of why older dogs may experience bad breath, it‚Äôs crucial to understand what halitosis is. Simply put, halitosis is an umbrella term for persistent bad breath. While it can affect dogs of all ages, it‚Äôs particularly prevalent in senior canines due to various factors related to aging.

### The Importance of Dental Health in Dogs

Just like humans, dogs require regular dental care to keep their teeth and gums healthy. Dental diseases, such as periodontal disease, are common culprits behind halitosis in older dogs. When plaque and tartar build up on the teeth, they create a breeding ground for bacteria. These bacteria not only multiply but also produce sulfur compounds that are notorious for causing bad breath.

#### Aging and Its Effects on Oral Health

As dogs age, they may develop weakened immune systems, which struggle to fight off infections and bacteria. Older dogs often experience a decline in saliva production, which is vital for washing away food particles and bacteria. Without enough saliva to keep their mouths clean, the risk of dental problems‚Äîand consequently, bad breath‚Äîskyrockets.

Common Causes of Bad Breath in Older Dogs
-----------------------------------------

So, let's get to the meat of the matter! Why do older dogs have bad breath? The reasons can be diverse, ranging from dental issues to underlying health conditions. Here are some of the primary culprits:

### 1. Periodontal Disease

This is a biggie! Periodontal disease is an infection of the tissues surrounding the teeth. In fact, research indicates that around 80% of dogs over the age of three exhibit signs of dental disease. Symptoms may include swollen gums, tooth loss, and, of course, that foul mouth odor.

### 2. Kidney Disease

You might not expect it, but kidney disease can significantly contribute to bad breath in older dogs. When the kidneys are functioning improperly, they cannot filter toxins from the blood efficiently. This builds up in the body and leads to a distinct ammonia-like odor on the breath.

### 3. Diabetes

Diabetes mellitus is another condition that can affect your dog‚Äôs breath. If your senior pup has diabetes, their breath may emit a sweet or fruity scent due to the presence of excess ketones.

### 4. Liver Issues

Liver dysfunction can also manifest as bad breath. When the liver isn‚Äôt filtering out toxins effectively, these can escape through the breath, resulting in a foul odor that‚Äôs hard to ignore.

### 5. Oral Tumors

Aging increases the risk of tumors, including those that may develop in the mouth. Oral tumors can create a variety of oral health issues, including bad breath. If you notice any abnormal growths or sores in your dog's mouth, it's time to visit the vet.

### 6. Other Health Conditions

Additional factors like respiratory infections, gastrointestinal issues, or even foreign objects stuck in the mouth can lead to bad breath. Your dog‚Äôs overall health plays a significant role in oral hygiene and breath quality.

Signs That Your Older Dog Might Have Bad Breath
-----------------------------------------------

Now that we've covered the main suspects behind bad breath in older dogs, it‚Äôs essential to recognize the signs beyond just the scent itself. After all, a dog can't exactly tell you what's wrong, right? Here are some signs to watch out for:

- **Persistent Foul Odor**: If your dog‚Äôs breath smells particularly bad, it‚Äôs time to investigate further.
- **Changes in Eating Habits**: If your pooch hesitates to eat or shows discomfort while chewing, dental issues could be the root cause.
- **Drooling**: Excessive drooling may indicate pain or discomfort associated with oral health problems.
- **Swollen Gums or Bleeding**: Red, swollen gums or bleeding during eating can signal periodontal disease.
- **Difficulty Eating**: If your dog is having trouble picking up treats or chewing kibble, dental issues may be at play.

What Can You Do About It?
-------------------------

Now that we‚Äôve established why do older dogs have bad breath, let‚Äôs talk solutions! Tackling bad breath can be approached from several angles.

### Regular Veterinary Check-ups

Regular veterinary examinations are a must for older dogs. Not only will your vet check their overall health, but they‚Äôll also perform oral assessments to identify any dental issues before they escalate.

### Professional Teeth Cleaning

Your vet can recommend professional dental cleanings, especially if your dog‚Äôs breath is particularly offensive. These cleanings typically involve anesthesia, so weigh the pros and cons, and discuss this option with your veterinarian.

### Home Dental Care

Establishing a dental care routine at home is crucial. Here are some practical steps you can take to keep your dog's mouth fresh:

- **Brushing**: Aim to brush your dog's teeth several times a week using dog-specific toothpaste. Regular brushing helps reduce plaque buildup dramatically.
- **Dental Chews**: Consider giving your pooch dental chews designed to reduce plaque and freshen breath.
- **Water Additives**: Specially formulated water additives can help kill bacteria and freshen breath when added to your dog‚Äôs drinking water.
- **Regular Dental Check**: At home, regularly check for signs of gum disease by looking at your dog‚Äôs gums and teeth.

### Diet Considerations

Believe it or not, diet plays an essential role in your dog's oral health. Some food types actually promote fresher breath:

- **Hard Kibble**: Crunchy kibble can help scrub away plaque as your dog chews.
- **Vegetables**: Fresh vegetables like carrots can aid in cleaning teeth naturally.
- **High-Quality Food**: Ensure your dog eats a balanced diet rich in nutrients and free from fillers.

### Hydration is Key

Make sure your dog has constant access to clean water. Proper hydration helps maintain saliva production and washes away food particles and bacteria in their mouth.

Natural Remedies for Bad Breath
-------------------------------

If you prefer natural remedies, there are many options to explore. However, always consult your vet before making any significant changes. Here are some popular approaches:

### 1. Parsley

This herb is known for its deodorizing properties. You can sprinkle fresh parsley on your dog's meals or make homemade parsley-infused dog treats.

### 2. Coconut Oil

Coconut oil may help inhibit bacterial growth in the mouth. A small teaspoon mixed into their food or used for brushing can work wonders.

### 3. Apple Cider Vinegar

Mixing a little apple cider vinegar into your dog‚Äôs water can help reduce bacteria, contributing to fresher breath. Just be sure to dilute it, as too much can upset their stomach.

Conclusion: Keeping Your Older Dog‚Äôs Breath Fresh
-------------------------------------------------

In conclusion, understanding why do older dogs have bad breath is vital for maintaining your loyal companion‚Äôs health and happiness. By keeping an eye on their oral hygiene, scheduling regular vet visits, and adopting a proactive approach to their dental care, you can significantly improve their breath and overall well-being. Remember, a dog‚Äôs breath shouldn‚Äôt smell like a skunk‚Äôs den; it should be a reflection of their health!

Any ideas for an indoor cafe/venue in Copenhagen or Gentofte which is nice to hold a birthday party with approx 15 people for a 3 year old?

I would be fine to buy coffee and cake there, or bring my own and pay a rental fee. 

I have for eg. been to a kids party at Kaffesalonen on the lake in Norrebro where the host brought their own birthday cake and the venue provided coffee and I guess some sort of fee was paid to be allowed to reserve the space and be there for a long time. It was not a private room but took place in a corner of the part on the lake with other patrons. It was very cosy. Looking for something similar so I don‚Äôt have to be a total copycat.

Although this common friend initially told her to drop me, I said no it'll not be practical. She seemed to agree.

Anyway then me and her were walking searching for cabs. I hailed a cab for her and opened the backseat door. She sat inside the backseat to the far end (road side) and then asked me ""can I drop you somewhere?""

I have done it before but didn't ride the whole night and cut it short. 
This time I am going somewhere and I won't be on my own so hopefully we'll make it thru the night and get to our hotel destination with a warm sauna and a breakfast. 
But my question is, what should I do with water?
It's going to freeze for sure. Should be well below 0C
There is no way I can take something warm and hope to keep it warm. 
Drinking ice cold water is going to be fine for some time but it's also not really pleasant. 
We have a couple of stops planned about every 70km. So I could just fill up the bottles with water and coffee. 
Any better idea?

We are looking to move to Pacifica in January, probably in Sharp Park and I just had some questions about the area since we don't know much about it. 

1) Is there concerning crime? Like, would we need a home alarm system? I've read mixed reviews all over Reddit and ""crime statistic"" sites. Do you worry about burglaries or anything? We're not gonna leave cars unlocked overnight or anything silly like that!

2) Related to above - is it safe if packages sit out on porches? 

3) Any good vegan food?

4) Does Whole Foods deliver there via Amazon? (I hear Oceana Market is good too!)

5) What months could I see whales?

6) Seems like there's a good artist community there? I read about the Sanchez Art Center and Fog Fest, which both seem super cool!

7) Any places or things we shouldn't miss in Pacifica? I've read there's good coffee shops and bakeries. And yes, I've seen photos of the Taco Bell lol.

It's not the worst it could have been so I'd love to get some opinions on what I should pursue as I want to charge additional fees for the issues listed below.

1. They threw a party. We do allow events but we explicitly state in the house rules to inform us ahead of time of any events. In addition we also have a a rule that no additional guests not listed on the booking can stay overnight mainly to avoid the issue of them partying throughout the night. We also didn't explicitly list quiet hours in the specified quiet hours setting since there's nothing governing the quiet hours but in the house rules we do ask to keep it down after 10am to be considerate of neighbors. The neighbors complained that they had people partying all night and even at 6am. So the three issues from this alone is that we weren't informed of the party, they had guests overnight that were not listed on the Airbnb reservation, and they disturbed the neighbors.
2. They left 9 full bags of trash near the garbage bins, 3 empty boxes scattered in the backyard, and another box of empty beer bottles, and of course additional trash found in odd places (coffee cups, soda cups, someone shoved a grocery bag of trash behind the microwave, etc.). I appreciate that they bagged almost everything up but they left it all outside of the garbage bin since that all wouldn't fit. Calculating, this would be about seven 32gallon bins worth of garbage, and anything over one 32-gallon bin has an additional fee of \~$6 for every 32 gallons. I want to charge them for the additional cost of the extra trash fees but want to know what your opinion on this is. We have pictures of the bags of trash.
3. They spilled things everywhere. The place smelled like beer well into the next day after they left. The smell still lingers, and all the floors in the kitchen, living room, and even in all the bedrooms were sticky with beer and/or other things. They also spilled a red drink or beer or or something in one of the beds. They tried to clean it by dumping water and cleaner all over the mattress but just made the spill worse as the stain spread so now we have a wet mattress. It is a 3-4ft wide stain. We'd want to ask them to cover mattress cleaning that the cleaners are quoting.
4. Our cleaners would have to clean not once but for 2 days as they needed to come back to do carpet and mattress cleaning since they didn't have these equipment with them the first day. The cleaning first day also took double the amount of time since they stained multiple towels and a lot of cabinet and doors had some sort of hand or finger prints of brown food on it. With almost every surface of the floor sticky, the rug in the living room obviously has some beer spills that's contributing to the lingering smell. Some stains that look to be food too. So we had to pay double for cleaning. I only have pictures of the mattress stain but none of the floor stickiness really showed up on the pictures so I don't think I have visual proof of how much was spilled everywhere.
5. They broke some decor, a small wood thing and one pot that you could find probably at Homegoods. They probably only amounted to maybe $30 but I don't have the receipts for this. I do have pictures of the broken decor.

So to summarize, I want to ask that the guests cover the additional garbage (\~$6 per 32 gallon, so about $36), additional cleaning which I estimate will be $200-350 extra for the additional day and mattress/rug cleaning which is generous considering I could charge cleaning and mattress/rug cleaning separately, still awaiting for quotes for this to confirm the cost. Note that we only charge $90 for cleaning on Airbnb even though cleaning for the house would be $150-200 (based on Turno bids). And the $30 to replace the decor.

Is this reasonable to request? Also should I ask the guest to cover this first or go straight to Airbnb resolution center?",4,1734375127.0,AirBnB,6,1.0,False

I've been putting this together for a while. Without further ado, I present

# u/autonomyfairy 's Guide to Profile Writing for Sugar Babies

## 1. Paint a picture.

Give details that make a really vivid mental image and show character. Those details can also show that you're fun, sexy, real and local.

*Instead of* - I like to go dancing with my friends

*Better* - **On Friday nights you'll find me at Club Cobra, tearing it up to Shakira in a sequined minidress.**

*Instead of* - I like kayaking and enjoying nature

*Better* - **I've been kayaking since I was 15, and I've kayaked in Louisiana, Arkansas and off the coast of Hawaii. Locally I love to pack a hummus wrap and spend Saturday mornings on the Big Bend River watching birds.**

## 2. Put him in the mental image with you.

Rather than saying, ""I enjoy art museums,"" say, **""I'd love to go to [local art museum] together!""** Rather than ""I enjoy walks in nature,"" say, **""Let's do a day hike at [local woods].""** Rather than ""I enjoy a great cup of coffee,"" say, **""Let me show you my pour-over technique in the morning üòâ""** or **""My favorite coffee is the ristretto at Cafe Moka - what's yours?""** See how that engages him and lets him envision his life with you in it?

## 3. Spin negatives into positives.

Don't say, ""I'm not into one-night stands."" Say, **""I'm looking for a long-term connection - I find that emotional closeness enhances physical closeness.""** Don't say, ""No hotel dates."" Say, **""Let's get lunch and hit up (local museum) before we get cozy by the fire.""**

## 4. Your what I'm seeking should be about the kind of relationship you want, not the kind of man.

I know, Seeking prompts you for this before it asks for your about-me, so it makes you think you should be focusing on ""what you want."" The reality is that this is a buyer's market - there are dozens of SB profiles for every real, legit SD. So it doesn't make sense here to go on about your ideal man and make any of them think they wouldn't fit it.

Instead, use this space to answer the ""what are you looking for?"" question: **how often are you thinking? when are you available (weekdays, weekends, daytimes, evenings)? What kind of dates are you envisioning? Are you looking for a boyfriend type situation, a side fling, NSA?**

### Kinky?
Offer it as an option, but don't describe it as *the* thing you want unless it's a deal breaker for you. For most of us, we might like a dominant man as our SD, but we'd rather have a vanilla SD than none. If you'd rather not have a sugar daddy at all than have one who doesn't spank you, by all means proceed.

## 5. Profile killers - do not do these.

**Don't** repeat any information that's already listed elsewhere in your profile. He can already see your name, age, height, location, body type and number of children. Don't waste valuable profile text space on that.

Cliches to avoid: ""looking for a partner in crime,"" ""my other half,"" ""here for a good time not a long time."" Boring and meaningless things: ""I never know what to say here,"" ""I'm shy at first but I warm up once you get to know me,"" ""I like going out and staying in,"" ""I'm better in person,"" ""just message me if you want to know more,"" ""I'm an open book.""

Red flags to avoid: princess, platonic, friends, shopping, spoiling. Complaining about scammers. Saying, ""no PPM."" Tests to make sure he's read (""if you've read this far, message me with your favorite ice cream flavor""). Avoid TikTok buzzwords: ""rest in my feminine,"" ""in my feminine energy,"" ""soft life."" 

## 6. Spelling, grammar, emoji.

People have been looking for ways to make their written text sound less formal for as long as we've been writing. Unfortunately, the mode you use is highly generationally specific, so it's very likely to land poorly.

Use standard English capitalization, punctuation and spacing, and sentence breaks. Make sure things that should be capitalized are capitalized (including proper nouns and acronyms). Emoji come off juvenile. Ask a friend (or chatGPT) to read it over to catch what you might have missed.

Saturday we went to a big Mistletoe Market and I brought my little rolly-walker-seat thing just in case. I sat on it while we were waiting in line for drinks but other than that I am not sure I needed it but it was good to have.

Then we went to a really good Indian restaurant and my friend was so nice because he asked and made sure I was able to sit in a booth before we got seated. Booth was fine.

1hfq7jp,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1hfq7jp/tips_on_gifts_for_our_wives/,Tips on gifts for our wives,"It's the final sprint this week & I know we're all scrambling to get gifts done/out of the way. Here is my .02 on gifts to get your wife this Christmas. 

First of all, *avoid* (like the plague) those ""care kits"" you see at the front isles of stores as you walk in. You know that seasonal spot - especially in places like Walmart or Target - where they rotate in/out product every few weeks? Don't shop there. Avoid any ""guide"" online too. 

Next, don't be afraid to ask her. And if you are, don't be afraid to ask those close to her. Her sister, her mom, her best friend, her coworker, etc. Shoot them a text & ask. I can't tell you how many times one of these people had given me a gift idea that my wife hadn't even told me about. A few years ago, my sister got these platform Crocs & my wife loved them. My sister told me about that & my wife was astounded that I had bought them for her.

If you want to get here any type of ""care"" kit, do this: I start by going into the bathroom - seeing what products my wife uses. Pay attention to her getting ready in the morning & what items she uses. Buy those. Is there a bottle of face moisturizer that's almost empty? Is there a tube of body scrub in the shower that smells like your wife does when she gets out of the shower? Buy it. Rifle through her purse. See what types of gums or ChapSticks or other small items she has in there. Buy it. Go into her car. Look through the glove compartment, the center console, the cup holders, the sunglasses holder - anything notable in there? Buy it.

Snacks. Stop in somewhere like Trader Joe's and see what snacks they have. Get her something unique, but not *out there*. If she's not into snacks, look to see if they have some tea's or coffee's that are unique/seasonal. Pro tip: even just getting a ""normal"" item from a place like Trader Joe's really helps to elevate the gift. For example, my wife loves popcorn. She eats it on the regular. I picked up a few small bags of popcorn from Trader Joes last year & it knocked her socks off. I know not everywhere has a Trader Joe's, so this may be harder - I have to drive nearly 30 minutes to get to ""my"" location. You could even go to a Whole Foods or a similar type of market. Amazon does Whole Foods deliveries now, which can be easier.

Look at restaurants/businesses near to where she works & get gift cards to those spots. I picked up 4 or 5 $25 gift cards to a few coffee shops/restaurants near where my wife works so that she can get lunch out a few times. 

Another thing that has worked *really* well for me in the past is to figure out which scents my wife likes. I will see if her lotions are scented, if she uses a specific type of perfume or body spray. *AND* if she likes any specific scents in our wax melts. Lord knows we have a dozen of those around our house. I check the closet & see which ones are almost empty & get a few of those. Doing this helped me to see that my wife *loves* vanilla. She didn't even realize - she thought she liked coconut the most, but every scented item she had contained vanilla.

Get her a framed photo. Not a frame. Not a photo. A framed photo. Find a photo of you & her (and optionally your kids) that is nice & presentable. I like to run it past a reliable second opinion. I use my sister-in-Law for these cases. You wouldn't believe how many things I overlook that she has caught in the past. Then, get it printed & go and get a frame. If you aren't sure what type of frame to get, look at all the frames you already have on the wall & get one that matches the style. If they all look to be the same brand/style, take one off the wall & see if there's a sticker on the back that mentions the brand. 

Also, depending on what your wife likes & her personality, get her some practical things. Things to make life a little easier each day. I got my wife a big bottle of Excedrin & Midol one year. My sister thought it was rude, but my wife loved the gift. She always forgets to go to the store to get them & by the time she remembers, she's already off her monthly. I also typically pick up stuff like hair ties, a claw clip, socks, etc. But my wife *loves* practical gifts. Some people do not.

Your mileage may vary, and I know I have a hard time coming up with gifts sometimes, so this is what has really helped me to do better over the years.",6,1734374735.0,daddit,8,1.0,False

She has always expected me to tend to her every beck and call. She lives out of town and every time she comes in town she expects us (her family) to treat her like a princess, and to cater to her every need. Yet whenever I visit her out of town, and always end up cooking and cleaning for her. She bullies us into doing anything she needs never takes no for an answer. I always end up bending to her will just to get her to shut up, and I‚Äôm fed up. Even when she‚Äôs in town we never have any real quality time. She‚Äôs always on the phone with her friends or texting and can‚Äôt take a break to look up and give us her attention. 

She‚Äôs been having some legal issues so shes been having to come back to our home town more often for court and every time she comes in like a hurricane. 

Today she was getting a breathalyzer installed in her car about 30 minutes away, and last minute demanded I pick her up and take her to my house so she could work, even though she would have to go pick up her car in 2 hours. I told her to act like an adult and uber to a nearby coffee shop because it would make no sense for me to drive 30 minutes there and back if her car was going to be done in 2 hours. She then laid down her typical manipulation tactics calling me selfish/lazy and I hung up on her and turned off my phone. She always says ‚ÄúI would do it for you‚Äù but I know she wouldn‚Äôt. She always blows me off for her friends and only calls me if she needs something or to talk about herself.

After I turned my phone off for 30 minutes I was welcomed by about 20 texts and phone calls of her calling me the bad guy and I really don‚Äôt want to see her or talk to her anymore.

Hiya, Odd_Variation!  Throwaway accounts are the norm here, and there are both positive and negative aspects to them - in your case, I regard it as a positive, a smart move given your circumstances. It's not *necessarily* a red flag. Now let's get to it, shall we?

>I've had experience with women in cult-like christian organizations and I don't see any flags of her trying to pull me into SGI.

Ah, you've been ""[missionary dated](https://archive.ph/rfOrP)""?  That's unfortunate.  [I have as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/447c6s/one_of_the_telltale_signs_someones_in_a_cult/) - it a cold-blooded manipulation.

>I'm a Christian but pretty open to interfaith relationships.

How devout are you?  Do you attend church regularly?  I'd offer the experience of someone I worked with - he was some evangelical brand of Christian; his wife was Catholic; and so they just attended separate churches.  And when they had kids, *she* took the kids to *her* church with *her*, and he was left going to *his* church all by himself.  He told me that he hadn't really considered how important a shared faith would turn out to be, but now that he knew, well, he might have decided differently...

I realize that it's too early to be talking about children, but people's attitude toward children really makes their perspective more clear, I think.  *Especially* since her family is SGI, there's going to be this expectation that, if you marry and have kids, they'll be [indoctrinated into SGI](https://i.imgur.com/WqhO8QH.png).  NOT Christianity.  If you state plainly that you do not want that, it will be happening anyway, just behind your back.  You know how people get when they feel like they know what's best for you.

>Needless to say I'm unfamiliar with anything buddhist and not very familiar with Korean culture.

Hmm... I've practiced where there are Koreans in the group before.  In the US (I'm assuming that's where you are), Korean Christian churches often seek out and approach Koreans, and invite them to join their churches.  This is typically the only place Koreans can socialize regularly with other Koreans and enjoy the shared Korean cultural touchstones in a nonKorean culture.  That's what one Korean SGI member told me. SGI does not offer that; it only offers its own Japanese-flavored culture.  So I dunno about the cultural background aspect.

>I do care if this is something I'm going to be dragged into or if I'll always be second fiddle because of how controlling the organization maybe.

That's a very strong risk, especially since her *parents* are involved. That presents an extra layer of complexity.  You might enjoy reading some of the interactions with others in relationships with SGI members - I'd say [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIcultRecoveryRoom/comments/45a88p/i_dont_know_what_to_do/).  There is a whole collection of posts by people who've been either married to or considering dating SGI members [over at our archive site here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExSGISurviveThrive/comments/9b6gzx/relationship_problems_when_one_person_is_an_sgi/) - that might be helpful, to see what other people who have gone there before you have to say.  Of course these are only the relationships that *haven't* worked out, similar to how, if you meet interfaith couples within SGI, those will be the ones that *have* worked out.  This is just one side - keep that in mind.

>It's early enough in our relationship that cutting it off will not be a big deal. I'm just very curious and would obviously like it to work out. But at the same time I almost expected something like this? Great girl, always a catch. 

Two different senses of ""catch"", of course.  I think you need more information.  Some honest discussions with your ladyfriend and have you met her family yet?  That's an important factor missing from this equation - what are *they* like and how do *they* treat you?  How do *they* act?  What's their home like? How SGI-themed is the decor?  That will tell you a lot.

>One last point, she has stated she hasn't had much experience (possibly at all) with relationships. I'd consider that a maybe red flag but given how studious in school, extra curricular activities, shyness, career etc I don't find it very odd. Age is mid to later 20s.

This isn't *necessarily* a red flag; what is her family's cultural attitude toward dating?  Some families are very traditional and patriarchal, frowning on casual dating.  There's a strong frowning on casual dating within SGI as well - when I joined, I was single (recently divorced) and I was told that I didn't need to date a lot of guys, because ""it only takes one"".  We were told this analogy of the elevator, that we're on an elevator in the relationships building.  If we get off in the basement, all we'll find is basement-caliber relationships.  If we want the penthouse relationship, we need to stay on the elevator (not dating) until we get there, and our daimoku is what determines whether the elevator will be an express or a rickety old cargo elevator.  This was typically followed up with the story of a Japanese YWD (unnamed, as always) who was chanting to marry a millionaire - no, a *billionaire*.  She chanted for 20 years and married a billionaire.  No details so that we could confirm that this actually happened IRL, of course.  But it makes for a nice story.  It also reinforces the ""make sure you stay in for 20 years"" theme that I heard from many SGI sources.  Well, I'll tell you  - *I* stayed in for 20 years, and nothing happened!  Everything I'd been told was a lie, so I quit.  And I'm much happier now.

My husband is the younger brother of a young woman I met through SGI - she has since moved on to other cults and increasing weirdness, but her brother and I have been married over 27 years.  However, though I was a devout SGI member/leader, my family's all Evangelical Christian, so no family pressure on him to practice.  Early on, I pressured him to practice, but I realized how unhappy *I* would feel if *HE* were pressuring me to go through the motions of a religion *I* did not want, so I stopped. I think that's a valuable concept to keep in your pocket in case it's needed - if she asks you to accompany her to SGI activities or chant with her, ask *her* to accompany you to a church of your choice and to either pray with you or read the bible with you.  Fair's fair, isn't it?

I do wish you all the best.  I don't think you have enough information yet to decide whether to pursue this or end it, not from what you've disclosed thus far, so I'd say gather more information! [Source](https://archive.ph/7MSTt)

>> I honestly think he was hiding this from me and playing a role so he could shakubuku me, no lie. I told him last night I would NEVER join SGI, I will NEVER chant nmrk, I will NEVER go to another meeting. He turned cold.

>One of the things that really bothered me was that the girls at the university were REALLY forward and suggestive.

All the while hinting about going on dates and whatnot.

""[Missionary dating](http://new.exchristian.net/2010/03/missionary-dating-nonbelievers.html)"" has ALWAYS been part of the Soka Gakkai recruitment plan.  Even when I joined, here in the US in 1987, the old Japanese war-bride ""pioneer"" used to say that, so long as we had plenty of YWD (young women), we'd never have to worry about recruiting YMD.  As it turned out, 1/3 of our YWD were lesbians and fully HALF of our YMD were gay!

When I moved here to So. CA, the Men's Division HQ leader was married to a Japanese expat - I once asked him how he came to start practicing this (pseudo-)Buddhism, and he said that it was a requirement for being involved with his wife.

But you can see that this approach was absolutely *commonplace* in the Soka Gakkai's/SGI's history:

>She described for us how she and her Soka Gakkai friends had converted many Americans:

>""You remember what was written in Time? Well, I'll tell you, it was true! In fact, it was worse than that! We would tell them, 'Before I'll sleep with you, come on to the temple.' Then, after they'd been baptized (gojukai), we'd leave them and they'd get mad and throw Gohonzonsama in the ditch. Or if they were real drunk, they'd take it on board and throw it in the harbor when they sailed away."" (p. 53)

>Why did these women engage in *shakubuku* in this unusual way? Divine favor was their basic aim, and the leaders told them that if they wanted to gain benefits, then they must perform *shakubuku*. They were told that not only would they thus benefit themselves and others, but in the process they would be helping bring about a truly happy, peaceful, and prosperous world.

1hfq3o7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hfq3o7/stranger/,Stranger,"  My wife and I recently moved to her hometown into her childhood home. It was bigger than our old house with plenty of room for not just our two cats, but a new kitten. He was a feisty little guy, easily the most courageous of his siblings. When we brought him home, it wasn‚Äôt long before he wanted to explore every nook and cranny of the place. If there was any space we thought it was too dangerous to let him into, he would throw a hissy fit at us, annoyed that there was an untouched area that he wasn‚Äôt allowed into. All this is to say, our little guy, Rorschach, was not easily cowed. It was a little surprising to us then, when he was staring, hair up and back arched, into what was to be my wife‚Äôs office one evening. The light was on, so I don‚Äôt think there was any way he could‚Äôve mistaken anything in there for a threat. Our other cat, Tarrare, was also in the office, so we thought maybe he got spooked by her, seeing as how the little guy still hadn‚Äôt gotten completely used to the other cats. I checked the office anyway, for pests or the like, then to be thorough, I looked along the wall outside. Nothing amiss. We didn‚Äôt think anything of it at the time. After all, Tarrare was completely at ease in the office.

  A few days later, we put our other cat, H√§agen-Dazs, alone in the bathroom with the hot water running. She had allergies and the steam from the shower seemed to ease her sinuses. After a short while, my wife, we‚Äôll call her RocksAnn, went to the bathroom to check on her. When she went in, she saw H√§agen-Dazs staring intently at the running water. She called her name, but she didn‚Äôt respond. Maybe the running water was too loud. She reached down to pet her, but when she did, H√§agen-Dazs flipped out, literally. She sprung up and flipped against the wall like a jack in the box popping out. I don‚Äôt know what made the poor girl so spooked. We‚Äôd done this shower treatment for her at least a dozen times before, but I guess it was the first time in the new house. Again we didn‚Äôt think much of this as all that really happened was our cat got spooked by a room she wasn‚Äôt really used to. Cats are finicky like that. H√§agen-Dazs was no different and unlike Rorschach was fairly timid and skittish. In fact I wouldn‚Äôt have bothered writing and posting anything about these two pretty mundane experiences had it not been for the next few weeks, and now I can‚Äôt help but feel there could be more to them.

   I should note how our house is situated. For the most part, it‚Äôs the usual setup of a neighbor‚Äôs house on either side and facing the street. The back though, rather than being framed by more neighbors, is lined with the town cemetery. It‚Äôs actually nice because most of our neighbors play loud obnoxious music. Not a peep from the cemetery though. Anyways, the first few weeks at the house went without incident besides those with the cats. Around the fourth week though, a few things seemed to be amiss. Little things mostly. Lights would flicker off, just for a moment, then something would be in a spot where I swear I didn‚Äôt leave it. One time I heard my wife call my name from another room, so I went to check on her.

  ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù, she asked.

  ‚ÄúYou called me.‚Äù I told her.

  ‚ÄúNah, your headphones must be blurring other noises.‚Äù

  Maybe. I did always wear headphones while doing most household tasks. Still, I heard her call my name clear as crystal. Could‚Äôve been she was messing with me. We did often scare each other. But that was always by cheap jump scares. Maybe she was making her scare game more convoluted but I didn‚Äôt think so. This was a woman whose humor was people falling over. She wasn‚Äôt exactly all about subtlety. Besides if she was messing with me, she would‚Äôve made sure to laugh at me about it later, but she never did. That was one of the weirder happenings. Another thing was my figurines. I collect a lot of action figure type stuff, bionicles mostly. Yes I‚Äôm twenty six years old. Most of them are pretty poseable figures and can have their limbs and heads moved every which way. Well I had a few on the kitchen table that I hadn‚Äôt put on a shelf yet. When I woke up one morning and went into the kitchen to make coffee, I barely noticed that all their heads were looking at the window that faced the cemetery. I know none of them were posed like that the day before. I don‚Äôt think my wife did that to mess with me either. It‚Äôs such a small thing that I could‚Äôve easily missed. I kinda wish we had some curtains for that window now. 

  Writing this now I also just realized when the weird goings on stopped, at least for a little while. Our house used to have central heating and a/c, but the system hasn‚Äôt been used for years, and we had no plans to start it back up again any time soon. So all the ceiling vents that had been open, we closed. It was such a small thing that I didn‚Äôt think about at the time. But that‚Äôs when all the weird happenings stopped for about a week. I pushed the past events to the back of my mind and assumed it was over. We‚Äôd more or less settled in and everything was finally smoothing out. I was content to jot the odd stuff up to the expected stress of moving into a new home. 

  My convenient illusion came to an inconvenient conclusion though, when my wife and I were woken up in the middle of the night by a terrified yelping. I got up and went to the kitchen where it was coming from. When I turned the light on I saw H√§agen-Dazs screaming and yelping and pawing at the kitchen window. I put on my shoes and went outside and looked around with my phone light. I probably should‚Äôve also carried a blunt object like a bat or something, but I never claimed to be smart now did I? Besides I assumed it would be something like another cat that set H√§agen-Dazs off. Our neighborhood had plenty of outdoor cats after all, and a similar thing happened at our old house with Tarrare. Her and a stray cat had gotten into a tiff with the window keeping them from getting at each other. Anyway I couldn‚Äôt find anything outside to warrant concern. That is until I shined the light on the window. That‚Äôs when my blood froze. On either edge of the window was a dirty handprint, and in the middle was a badly drawn happy face, also from dirt. Two dots and a semi circle. The dirt had dripped down in spots. From the left eye it looked like a tear. I did not want to be outside a second longer. I went in and made sure all the doors were locked. When I told RocksAnn what happened we decided to call the police. We told them what happened and showed them the handprints. Unfortunately for whatever reason, there were no fingerprints to examine. Whoever it was must‚Äôve been wearing gloves they said. They told us that since we weren‚Äôt in the best neighborhood, it‚Äôs possible that some kid was in our yard and trying to mess with us. There wasn‚Äôt much else they could do, so we were told to keep an eye open and call if anything else happened. We didn‚Äôt really sleep that night.

  The next couple of weeks were rough to say the least. I started finding those same dirty handprints on both of our vehicles. A couple times there was one on the living room window. We called the cops again twice, but there was still no way to trace the prints. I wanted to set up cameras but we couldn‚Äôt afford much in that department. One night I did tape my phone high on the wall facing the cemetery to record all night. Nothing. Things came to a head on a Saturday night. We were just about to fall asleep, when I heard something that froze my blood. A knock. At the back door. Well not quite a knock. More like a slap. I got up and put on my robe. Quietly as I could, I inched to the front door. RocksAnn waited for me in the living room. I put my ear close to the back door, waiting. In spite of me wearing a fairly thick robe, it felt so cold. I know we hadn‚Äôt insulated the back door but still, the cold air was thick and almost made it hard to breathe. Even though I was expecting it, I still almost jumped out of my skin when I heard the slap again. The hand, or what I assumed was the hand, slid against the door. Almost like a cat pawing, but slower and more rough. And also more‚Ä¶deliberate. The doorknob remained undisturbed. I motioned away from the door as silently as I could. My hand found a hammer that I still hadn‚Äôt found a place in the house for. The stranger pawed at the door once more. That‚Äôs about when I heard the stranger‚Äôs voice, only it wasn‚Äôt a stranger‚Äôs voice. It was my wife‚Äôs voice on the other side of the door.

  ‚ÄúH-Hel-lo?‚Äù, said the stranger. I was not about to answer back. The way their greeting was spoken sounded breathy. Almost like a whispered hiss. I could see RocksAnn from where I stood at the kitchen/back door. Through the darkness, I could see her face had gone ashen. I can‚Äôt imagine I looked any different. The stranger‚Äôs one word had shifted our perspective on the past few weeks. Whatever was on the other side of that door was no punk kid or vagrant. No telling if it was really a person at all. And while my wife and I said nothing to each other, the looks we exchanged affirmed that neither of us wanted to find out. After waiting for a few painfully long minutes, the stranger made a new noise. Not a slap on the door, but a knock. And then they spoke once more, now more clearly and fluently. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù It was my own voice this time. I had to cover my mouth to keep from gasping. It knocked one more time, in this case with a rhythm I used all the time: shave and a haircut. 

  Knock-knockknockknockknock. 

  Now I was starting to get pissed. It‚Äôs like it was mocking us, and not just because it was using our voices. Still, I was not about to open the door. Nor were either of us going to say a word to our would be intruder. All we could do was wait. It didn‚Äôt knock again. It didn‚Äôt repeat its greetings. All it did was breathe, loud enough to be heard by me anyway. It sounded tired. Almost like an old man whose lungs weren‚Äôt what they used to be. I hoped it couldn‚Äôt hear us breathe. For the better part of an hour I stood by the door shivering. I should‚Äôve been sweating in my thick robe. Eventually the breathing faded, and the deep chill subsided. And the room felt normal again. For a minute I thought it was over, and maybe it was. But I never claimed to be smart now did I? 

  For whatever reason, curiosity, stupidity, whatever you like, I moved my hand to the doorknob. I saw my wife shake her head at me emphatically. I mouthed a probably unconvincing ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fine‚Äù at her, and I opened the door and went outside. I shined my phone light through the night and saw no sign of anything. It was a quiet, still night. Peaceful even. Or at least it would be if it weren‚Äôt for the past hour. I shined my light at the still open door. On the outside was the familiar dusty handprint, slid down the door. I put my hand next to it. It was a little smaller than mine. I decided it was probably time to get back inside and lock the door. That was about when I heard a gust of wind getting louder by the second. I swore under my breath and scrambled inside and just as I was slamming the door, I felt a burst of blistering cold, dusty wind. I looked at RocksAnn. She had both hands in her hair and the most horrified look I had ever seen on her face. I tried to think, to delude myself, that maybe it was just ordinary wind, or that I‚Äôd closed the door in time. But I knew better. I‚Äôd let my curiosity get the best of me. And I‚Äôd foolishly let a stranger into our house.",4,1734374461.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs usually either him initiating (I did initiate one day) or us continuing a conversation from the night before, we‚Äôve had several long night chats.

We met again yesterday for our second date, went Christmas shopping together, had coffee and went for a wine glass, altogether spending four hours together. He was very flirty, touchy, complimentary towards me. 

Upon parting, he asked what I am doing next week, and I answered with plans I had for Tuesday. He explained his plans for Thursday, looked thoughtful, then made a joke about maybe seeing me tomorrow (today, a Monday). I said maybe and he responded jokingly about ‚Äúseeing how my hair looked‚Äù (we‚Äôd been joking previously about rain ruining our hair).

After I got home he texted me that he had been very tired on our date and hadn‚Äôt wanted to confess it but was feeling it now. I responded that I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, that maybe we shouldn‚Äôt have gone for the wine and that I hope he rests. He said no worries, he was happy to have done it, and recommended a TV show he was watching. I responded saying that I‚Äôve seen adverts for the show and it reminded me of another. He took an hour to respond to this and answered very shortly, saying this show was worth it and I might find some topics of interest there.

I didn‚Äôt respond as it felt like an end to the conversation and he clearly was tired. But today, he has not texted at all and he is someone who is online very frequently.

I‚Äôm wondering if I should pursue this further, if I wait for him to text or what would be the right strategy?

1hfpxon,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hfpxon/i_20f_am_considering_to_stopheavily_limit_hanging/,I (20F) am considering to stop/heavily limit hanging out with my male friends to keep my relationship with my bf (20M) safe. How to proceed? ,"For the context: I went to high school where majority of students were boys. I struggled making female friends, and even ones I managed to befriend later on turned out to talk behind my back and lie to me. So I got stuck with many male friends and few female friends even though I try really hard to befriend more girls. Also to note: my bf and I have been together for a year and half. 

I usually let my bf know where and with who I am, either before I go out or during the hangout just so he can know where I am, he never asked me before to do this, it's my decision. 

I went to get a coffee with one friend from high school (20M) yesterday, because my uni is not working and I don't get to talk to people which I usually enjoy doing, so I figured I need to socialize. Blah blah hangout goes well I am a bit tired, and as we decide to go catch a busses I am like oh would u mind I call my boyfriend I just wanna let him know where I am and that stuff because we are out of the caffee its not loud anymore, we're catching busses anyways soon and that friend is like yea ofc its fine so I call him tell him where I am with who I am so u know he doesn't worry, I tell him I will call him when i get home so he doesnt worry and all goes okay fine

So, I called my bf today we talked about a lot of stuff in general and alao where I was yesterday and then he asks me something along the lines of
Can u just please tell me if ur going with any of ur male friends on 1-1 hangouts beforehand, because my friends saw u yesterday and they like called me to tell me and stuff so it kinda felt uncomfortable to hear it first from them. (he said it in other words but I could hear that he was a bit uncomfortable) 
And ofc I told him I will let him know before hangouts no problem I just never thought people would perceive me like that, I understand that he feels uncomfortable and thats okay I just don't know what to do in this situation. Everything just feels wrong and this relationship means so much to me, even the thought about anything bad happening makes me feel terrible. I'm considering to stop hanging out with male friends, if not completely, then majority of the time I usually hang out, so it comes down to about 1-2 times a year, and ofc let my bf know when and what and where I decide to go. This is just my idea how can I solve this.

Question: What is the best thing I can do from here? How do I proceed? 

TL;DR - I hanged out with male friend, my bf hears it from his friends before I manage to call him and tell him myself, I think about stopping hanging out with male friends because of possible misunderstandings

1hfpx1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hfpx1r/i_am_really_confused_and_need_your_advice/,I am really confused and need your advice.,"My ex and I got together this summer. I had not intentions of being exclusive with anyone this year, mainly because my previous relationship was particularly long and I wanted a break to just enjoy socialising and dating. We started dating and a month into us dating she asked to be exclusive. I was apprehensive but I said yes. Mainly because I really liked her and I could see a future together. I did not want to throw  something real just to sleep around. 
Things were going well, we were very fond of each other. I had a holiday planned from before we met. I went to this holiday and things just changed. She started getting distant and texting me less. She texted saying things don‚Äôt feel the same,while I was 5000 miles away. I tried enjoy the rest of the holiday anyways even though things were at the back of my mind. The day after I land she said lets meet to clear air. I knew what was coming. Her reasonings for splitting up me were very trivial. She did not want to lean on anyone when she was stressed.   Plans I was suggesting for holidays were too much for her. It was an emotional affair but we decided to part ways.  I was trying to get on with my life.
She messages me that weekend saying she misses me. I ask her if she wants to get coffee and talk it out. We talk it out and she reveals she has avoidant attachment style. We talk and agree we will try make it work. That she will not get easily triggered. And I will learn when she needs alone time and when she needs support. Things were going well for a week and then her texting stops again. I let it be for 2 days and on third day ask if everything is alright. She calls me in the evening saying ‚Äú she is a very busy person and texting is overwhelming her‚Äù. I say, ok then we wont text as much. She says this is too much hard work and we should split up. I got annoyed because I am being dicked about. I lay it out  on how she asked for exclusivity, how she broke up with me, asked for me back and she is breaking up with me again. I can sense shift in her tone how she turned from my girlfriend to a stranger then and there. I hung up because I was getting upset. I had time to digest it and I felt bad for having a go at her for our last words. So I sent what was meant to be her xmas gift with a letter saying how we had fun and I wish her all the best. I would like to ask you guys, is this something to do with her attachment style or her feelings for me just vaporised somehow. ",1,1734373991.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False
1hfpwsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/1hfpwsv/amateur_soundperson_and_musician_with_live_drums/,Amateur SoundPerson and musician with live drums questions.,"I just found/joined this sub-reddit today. I will start by saying I am an amateur drummer/vocalist with decades of gigging experience from coffee-shops, to club venues, to large stages (not as much). I have learned over the years some basic sound reinforcement knowledge - and some might say above-average results (subjective).

As I am writing this post, I realized I will not ask **all** my questions here in one post, but break them into separate posts to minimize confusion and crosstalk.

First one: A very \*general\* question that is difficult to answer - I know - but... if I (we) want to segu√© into the realm of Tribute Acts that focus on small theaters, private events, and mid-size outdoor festivals, does it make sense to find and hire a ""sound company""... or maybe hire a dedicated sound engineer for the project...? or maybe rely solely on the venue's system and engineer...?

I ask because up until now, doing the local bar/club scene, I have been using my own digital console (PreSonus StudioLive) to dial-in our sound and bring it with us venue-to-venue. Because I've taken the time and care to tweak the monitor mixes and monitor ""shaping"" for each individual... when we get to venues, there is almost little-to-no tweaking that needs to be done for the band members to be \*happy\* with their mixes (primarily floor wedges, not IEM). And because of how I routed the kit to a submix, but the reverb for that kit goes to a dedicated fader next to it on a user-layout, I can adapt to venue sizes by having ZERO drum mic's in the FOH mix, but push-up the fader slightly for the REVERB to lightly back-fill the sound of the acoustic kit... as well as a bunch of other tricks and stuff to make it easier for me to Mix from stage (while playing drums).

So, if we were to try to take a project to the Theater realm where everything would need to be in the FOH and it'd be better to have a soundperson - do you think it'd be feasible for me to just keep using my PreSonus board, but now have a professional engineer run it - but keeping our monitor bliss in place...? I know a StudioLive is not ""touring-level"" gear... but it's also not chopped liver.

I can envision either running CAT5 stage boxes (I have two 16-in/8-out Network stage boxes) and let the board be relocated to FOH position... or... maybe the FOH engineer is okay running iPad mixing/control software to run the show. We seem to see more and more of that... but I know if it were \*ME\* running someone else's sound, I would prefer physical faders.

So... is it foolish to think that I could continue to leverage my digital console and allow a professional to adapt it to whatever system is available... and get the benefits of ""Saved"" scenes and profiles... or, just let the professionals use the gear \*THEY\* want and we just deal with needing to (re)create monitor mixes over and over at each gig with minimal consistency...?

Long post - sorry...

It‚Äôs usually either him initiating (I did initiate one day) or us continuing a conversation from the night before, we‚Äôve had several long night chats.

We met again yesterday for our second date, went Christmas shopping together, had coffee and went for a wine glass, altogether spending four hours together. He was very flirty, touchy, complimentary towards me. 

Upon parting, he asked what I am doing next week, and I answered with plans I had for Tuesday. He explained his plans for Thursday, looked thoughtful, then made a joke about maybe seeing me tomorrow (today, a Monday). I said maybe and he responded jokingly about ‚Äúseeing how my hair looked‚Äù (we‚Äôd been joking previously about rain ruining our hair).

After I got home he texted me that he had been very tired on our date and hadn‚Äôt wanted to confess it but was feeling it now. I responded that I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, that maybe we shouldn‚Äôt have gone for the wine and that I hope he rests. He said no worries, he was happy to have done it, and recommended a TV show he was watching. I responded saying that I‚Äôve seen adverts for the show and it reminded me of another. He took an hour to respond to this and answered very shortly, saying this show was worth it and I might find some topics of interest there.

I didn‚Äôt respond as it felt like an end to the conversation and he clearly was tired. But today, he has not texted at all and he is someone who is online very frequently.

I‚Äôm wondering if I should pursue this further, if I wait for him to text or what would be the right strategy? I don‚Äôt want to be pushy, but I‚Äôm wondering if this indicates a loss of interest, as it seemed very sudden for him to not continue the convo and not text at all today.",1,1734373861.0,Advice,0,0.99,False

I was dreaming that I was the passenger in my cousin‚Äôs car. She was driving and I was directing her to a coffee place I often visit in real life (It was morning and we wanted somewhere nice to hang out). In my dream, she was driving perfectly fine but someone in the opposite direction came crashing into us and her car swerved around before coming to a stop. Immediately, we got out of the car and started making sure everyone was okay while exchanging information/calling for help. I remember I was helping my cousin while we spoke with the other person who crashed into us, and everything ended up being okay.

However, soon after, I woke up from this dream and heard LOUD sounds of glass shattering outside our home. I was like ‚ÄúWhat the hell?!‚Äù because it sounded so loud and crazy that I thought something was exploding or something huge was crashing into our house. Then, after it stopped, I heard people shouting and asking if everyone was okay. I got up immediately, looked outside and there was an actual car crash! One car was completely flipped over and looked like it had skidded or something, it was a small truck and everything in it was on the street all over. Another smaller car was in the intersection we live right next to and looked to be all messed up (Our house is the second one on the corner of this intersection) üò≠. I went outside but was tripping out because I was like ‚ÄúI literally was just dreaming of a car crash and wake up to a real one!! WTF..‚Äù 

As I‚Äôm outside I see the person (he was an older man) who was driving the truck but severely in shock while being helped. I couldn‚Äôt see the person in the other smaller car, or what happened to them but people were surrounding it.  An ambulance and cops came right away and everything got all blocked off. One person was taken in on a stretcher so I got really worried they were hurt, but they seemed okayish? I believe it was the older man from the truck and he was on the phone talking but clearly shaken. I have no idea what happened with the smaller car‚Äôs driver/ passengers but my mom says she saw them get pulled out and taken care of as well. I think everyone was okay, we have to wait and see for any reports about it‚Ä¶but it was a scary thing to wake up to and witness. I hope both people will be okay üò≠! Everything got handled so fast, but there are still people cleaning up the street from all the debris‚Ä¶

For a bit of context: we live on a main street, so car crashes that we witness happen OFTEN. People are always speeding on our street and taking fast turns, so I have gotten to see a large amount of different car crashes living here. One car crash actually resulted in someone driving into our house gates and bricks üíÄ, that happened last year. I have had quite a few dreams that end up happening, but this was the first time I have ever dreamt of something this intense that happens literally when I wake up‚Ä¶

Regardless though, I am hoping the drivers involved will be okay and come through this. I am glad they at least got help very fast‚Ä¶

He served in the US Navy for four years and was a veteran of the Korean War. While in the Navy, Sebring developed the hair styling skills that would make him famous. When he arrived in Los Angeles, Kummer began using the name Jay Sebring - the J for the first initial of his middle name and Sebring from the race car. As he was starting out in the industry, Sebring noted that there weren't many services available for men when it came to hair apart from the traditional barber. He set out to revolutionize the hair care industry by going beyond the barber, pioneering the industry of men's hairstyling. He taught others his men's hair care techniques as The Sebring Method, which went beyond just cutting hair. According to some accounts, he was the first person to open a male hair salon in the country, and his cutting-edge men's hair care style attracted big-name clients. At the request of Kirk Douglas, Sebring was the stylist for the movie ""Spartacus."" In 1960, Sebring married a model, Cami, but they divorced in 1965. In 1964, Sebring took martial arts lessons from master Bruce Lee. He took a tape of Bruce to producer William Dozier (""Batman""), and Dozier signed Lee to be on the TV show ""Green Hornet,"" which made Bruce a household name. It was also in 1964 that Sebring met actress Sharon Tate at a Hollywood party, and they began dating. Upon Sebring's divorce, conflicting accounts abound about whether Sebring proposed to Tate, while others state that Tate wanted to get married, but Sebring was hesitant. The matter was decided when Tate went to London to film ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" and fell for the movie's director, Roman Polanski. Tate called Sebring to break up, but Sebring insisted on meeting Polanski to decide if he was ""good enough for her."" Polanski gained Sebring's approval, and he stayed within the couple's tight circle of friends. Sebring opened a new salon in the summer of 1969 in San Francisco, financially backed, in part, by Abigail Folger of the Folgers coffee family. He also founded Sebring International, a company selling men's hair products. On August 9, 1969, Sebring, along with Sharon Tate, Wojciech Frykowski, and Abigail Folger, was murdered by members of the Manson Family cult at the home of Roman Polanski. His funeral was held on August 13, 1969. A feature-length documentary about his life was released in 2020.",1,1734373799.0,crimesanddisasters,0,1.0,False

Now, I'm overwhelmed with options and hoping to get some advice:

I'm looking for a pretty straightforward, low maintenance machine and grinder to be used in AZ (read: HARD WATER) to make potentially 50 drinks a day. 
Wondering if we are looking at the Gaggia Classic Pro, Turin Legato, or something more like the Rancilio Silvia Pro X Dual Boiler. I like the Rocket Appartamento but it looks too overwhelming for a beginner.
For grinders, I see a lot of reccs for the Baratza Sette 30, but I am thinking it would be better to have a larger hopper instead of just one cup at a time. 
Think less good espresso with tons of controllable variables, more easy, durable espresso machines that still make a great shot. Also to keep in mind, I will have to show EVERYONE how to make their coffee......

I‚Äôm not a dental professional and I can‚Äôt speak for anyone else‚Äôs experience I just know what triggers my anxiety is similar for a lot of people and I am finally feeling relieved 7 days post op that nothing has truly gone wrong.

DAY OF SURGERY:
I got all 4 wisdom teeth out surgically last Monday. The bottom two were impacted. I was terrified for months and had moved the surgery twice. I‚Äôd never been put under or had any surgery for that matter and I have pretty bad health anxiety (possibly ocd but not diagnosed) . I had a bit of a freak out right before they put me under because it felt like so much was happening but I expressed this to the ladies taking care of me and they reassured me and let me take a second to breathe. I REALLY recommend looking for an office with great reviews. I asked a friend who had a positive experience getting hers out where she went and she said this place was amazing so I chose to go here. I remember the doctor telling me to think about something positive like all the milkshakes I‚Äôll be drinking the following week and then I remember waking up to Charlie Brown Christmas on the tv and feeling like my mouth was full and tasted like blood. I felt sleepy and confused and remember asking the other lady in the room if everything went okay and she said yes sweetheart let‚Äôs go see your mom. And that was that!

FIRST THREE DAYS;
My diet consisted of pudding, jello, mashed potatoes, refried beans, soup, and milkshakes. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve already read no sucking, spitting, straws, seeds, etc. etc. so I‚Äôm not gonna bore you with that. Swallowing was incredibly hard for me so for the first three days I had a washcloth tucked into my shirt at all times to be my bib. I drooled constantly. I watched a lot of movies and shows and played stardew valley. I slept sitting up on my back and did a saltwater rinse and rinsed with the mouthwash they prescribed after everytime I ate something. I was constantly hungry and the pain meds and amoxicillin hurt my stomach. I have been taking 600 mg Ibprophen every 6 hours and Tylenol every 4 hours *HAVE A ROUTINE WITH PAIN MEDS* don‚Äôt miss a dose, set an alarm at 3 am if you have to. I have experienced little to no pain because of this. I also have been icing my face on and off every 20 mins so I‚Äôve had little to no swelling. After a couple days switch to heat to get the movement back in your jaw. I bled constantly the first day, a little the second day, and once the third day but only slightly. My mouth tasted like shit honestly, it‚Äôs a mix of the blood and nasty healing stuff and trapped food and it‚Äôs gross. Even after I gently brushed my teeth and did the mouthwash my breath was stanky, but it‚Äôs normal. The first couple days sucked but mostly cause I was hungry and absolutely terrified of dry socket. But I lived. 

Note‚Ä¢ Day 3 is when I noticed I still had no feeling in the right half of my bottom lip and chin, currently on day 7 I don‚Äôt have any feeling but I‚Äôve heard this happens and it should come back soon. It doesn‚Äôt really bother me it‚Äôs just a weird feeling. 

Day 4-6:
I noticed throughout these days I was starting to feel better. I have been eating Mac n cheese, scrambled eggs (pro tip- scramble on low with a couple tablespoons of water to get the fluffiest eggs, no chewing required), smoothies, soup with noodles, etc. I noticed my breath starting to not smell or taste as bad probably because I could brush my back teeth a little easier. Day 4 I would say was my hardest day because I wanted to be done with this. I wanted to fall asleep and wake up in two weeks all healed and back to normal. On the night of day 4 I was brushing my teeth and accidentally grazed my top left extraction sight. It started bleeding and I had a bit of a meltdown. I was sobbing and terrified I had just dislodged the clot and I was a goner. I put gauze over it for a few minutes and when I pulled it away I realized it had stopped and it was actually just one of my stitches had come out. It‚Äôs been fine since then lol. Day 6 I cleaned my whole apartment and had coffee again for the first time in a week which was amazing (lukewarm coffee btw, still avoiding hot liquids). I slept on my side the night of day 6 which was awesome too. I told my boyfriend I really want to go out for dinner when I‚Äôm all healed and he agreed and we discussed all the amazing things I‚Äôll be able to eat which is giving me something to look forward to haha.

Alright so now here we are on day 7. I just ate my breakfast of scrambled eggs, a smoothie, and avocado. I called my surgeon this morning to double check I‚Äôm good to use the syringe since it‚Äôs day 7 and he said I‚Äôm all good! I was pretty terrified to use it since I‚Äôve been actively avoiding the holes in my mouth and now I face them. I toughened up, went to my bathroom, used a flashlight and a tiny mirror and got to work. And uh yeah, a lot of stuff came out of them. It was gross. But kinda satisfying like other people have said. And my mouth felt a lot cleaner. I know it is so scary but after I did it I immediately was like wow that was not scary at all. I did wait till one week post op and that reduced my anxiety a lot because I knew I was past the point where dry socket was most likely to happen.

All in all, getting my wisdom teeth removed really sucked. At some points I was like dang maybe I should‚Äôve left those suckers in there BUT I know I wouldn‚Äôt be wanting to deal with this in ten years when they are negatively impacting my quality of life. My top recommendations are to be somewhere your comfortable with people who will take care of you and make you feel reassured and to do things to make yourself happy during the process. I took a bath every night with candles and ate ice cream and played music I love and it was something to relax me and help me look forward to something. On the 4th day my boyfriend brought my tiramisu and I actually cried with joy lol. I bought a couple new games to try out on my switch to reward myself for going through something so difficult. Do things for yourself to make the experience less miserable, and you got this! I was in your shoes and trust me I was a mess. But now I‚Äôm starting to see the other side and realize that I‚Äôm gonna be fine and maybe it wasn‚Äôt so bad after all. 

Feel free to ask me any questions and I‚Äôll answer if I can help in any way :). ",8,1734373391.0,wisdomteeth,2,1.0,False

the other day he was supposed to come spend the night, but he never confirmed the time so I went in the shower, he called me and I didn't answer and he assumed I was with someone else (it was 2am). I reassured him that was not the case.

a day later, I get a text from a guy I had meet at a coffee shop. i felt okay giving this guy my info as I'm not exclusive with my ex and he is seeing other women as I mentioned. my ex saw the text while he was here at my house and he asked me about it and I assured him it was nothing. the problem is that this guy I met is an underground music producer like actually in the industry, and my ex is an aspiring music producer/ rapper. I think this may have hurt his ego along with him thinking he can't trust me. sadly, I initially texted the producer that night asking for any recommendations he had for a christmas present for an inspiring musician (my ex). i really had no bad intentions. 

I know this is ultimately a toxic relationship and I should leave him. but I've done nothing wrong. even though we're not together, I haven't slept with/ dated/ talked to anyone else in years. how can I make him understand that without pushing him further away?

I know places come and go, but I am especially sad to see New Moon close, in a large part because they always had at least a cup of coffee for our downtown-dependent residents, the only place that would serve them in the earlyish morning. Also, New Moon opened up at night during extreme winter weather for at least a year, when such space was hard to come by.

If you managed to cut out bread, what did you replace it with?

What fruits or veg do you find helped you?

I'm exercising about 3 times a week, what type of exercise helped you?

I am down from 3 sugars in my tea/coffee to only one. Sometimes even half a teaspoon

I've heard counting calories but isn't it easier just to make sure everything you eat is healthy?

Is there 1 day a week you allow for a cheat day?

Are boiled eggs a healthy way to fill you up?

I'm 130kg (286lb), ideally I'd like to lose 30kg by June, doctors orders. If i can lose 15kg (33lb), that would also be great.",0,1734372904.0,WeightLossAdvice,37,0.44,False
1hfpgyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1hfpgyv/i_am_really_confused_id_like_your_opinions/,I am really confused. I‚Äôd like your opinions.,"My ex and I got together this summer. I had not intentions of being exclusive with anyone this year, mainly because my previous relationship was particularly long and I wanted a break to just enjoy socialising and dating. We started dating and a month into us dating she asked to be exclusive. I was apprehensive but I said yes. Mainly because I really liked her and I could see a future together. I did not want to throw  something real just to sleep around. 
Things were going well, we were very fond of each other. I had a holiday planned from before we met. I went to this holiday and things just changed. She started getting distant and texting me less. She texted saying things don‚Äôt feel the same,while I was 5000 miles away. I tried enjoy the rest of the holiday anyways even though things were at the back of my mind. The day after I land she said lets meet to clear air. I knew what was coming. Her reasonings for splitting up me were very trivial. She did not want to lean on anyone when she was stressed.   Plans I was suggesting for holidays were too much for her. It was an emotional affair but we decided to part ways.  I was trying to get on with my life.
She messages me that weekend saying she misses me. I ask her if she wants to get coffee and talk it out. We talk it out and she reveals she has avoidant attachment style. We talk and agree we will try make it work. That she will not get easily triggered. And I will learn when she needs alone time and when she needs support. Things were going well for a week and then her texting stops again. I let it be for 2 days and on third day ask if everything is alright. She calls me in the evening saying ‚Äú she is a very busy person and texting is overwhelming her‚Äù. I say, ok then we wont text as much. She says this is too much hard work and we should split up. I got annoyed because I am being dicked about. I lay it out  on how she asked for exclusivity, how she broke up with me, asked for me back and she is breaking up with me again. I can sense shift in her tone how she turned from my girlfriend to a stranger then and there. I hung up because I was getting upset. I had time to digest it and I felt bad for having a go at her for our last words. So I sent what was meant to be her xmas gift with a letter saying how we had fun and I wish her all the best. I would like to ask you guys, is this something to do with her attachment style or her feelings for me just vaporised somehow. ",2,1734372870.0,AvoidantBreakUps,4,1.0,False
