Is there something like that, or are we supposed to lead such a miserable and less-than-ideal life?

I want to lose weight, I keep eating fast food. 
I want to save money and achieve financial goals, but I keep ordering uber/doordash and impulsively buying stuff I could easily go without.
I want to get in better shape, but I keep not using the walking pad I bought, to not be able to tell myself the reason I'm not going out is the cold, the snow, people or anything else.
I want to be more flexible, but I cannot remember to take as little as 5 minutes daily to stretch.
I want to improve my memory, but I keep smoking weed a few times a week, when I'm alone.
I used to say loud and proud that I'm absolutely not able to drive under the influence, and that I would never do that; but I started doing it a few weeks ago (rare instances, but still doesn't excuse the act)
I want to stop overthinking and freaking out about things that don't warrant that quantity of energy, but I keep using cannabis even though it clearly exacerbates a lot of anxiety symptoms for me.
I'm having trouble breathing sometimes and feel like it is due to my inhalation of the drug, but I. keep using it. 
I want to get back into reading every day and keep a book on my nightstand, one on my coffee table and various others throughout the house, but can't pick any up to read even though I enjoy their content.
Id love to draw on a regular basis (first milestone could be once every week...) and bought an ipad a few years ago for the convenience of it, but I haven't drawn at all since the beginning of the year.
Id love to practice yoga often (to help with back pain, amongst other numerous benefits) and have a ton of resources to help me with that, but rarely ever complete a 10 or 15 minutes.
Id love to feel energetic in the morning, but am not following any sleep schedule at all when im off work.
Id love to feel energetic during the day, but cannot remember to drink my 710 ml bottle over my 10-12hr shifts.

Why am I like this ? I read somewhere that when a change needs to be done, but you keep avoiding and going in another direction, it is because you are not ready deep down. When will I be ready? I already feel like the remaining time to attempt changing those things, especially ny physical health, is almost over because of how I feel in my own body. (But I'm just an obese 27yoF that's always been sedentary even though she's always dreamed of being in shape)

I don't necessarily want to die (I'm afraid of death) but I'm tired of actively criticizing myself on my inaction while I'm laying on the sofa eating my lukewarm 50$, uber-delivered mcDonald's. It's like I'm watching myself ruin my life in slow motion.

I used to have shitty self-esteem and think I could never achieve anything I really wanted. Then, my vision of it changed and I realized I wasn't worthless nor incapable. And I know I have value.

This cafe has served as our safe haven while we prepared for the battle that waited ahead of us. The crew and manager are all kind and accommodating to us that we always feel at home here. Yes, we stay from 7-8am and head out around 7-8pm as well. We also order a lot to compensate our overstay and they‚Äôre all very supportive of us in our feat. You get the picture. ü•∞


And many of those long tiring days, we always say that the *dream* is to go to this cafe, not to read our thick and heavy reviewers but just to sit, enjoy our coffee and meal while having a leisure reading of our favorite book. What a seemingly ordinary dream, right? But it only implies that if we can finally do that, it means we‚Äôre already done with the review phase and have already gained that hard-earned *‚Äùdot‚Äù*. 


So here I am right now. Chatting my mom, telling her I‚Äôm just here reading a book in preparation for my court appearance tomorrow.

I definitely had the anxy feelings but I pushed through, I wasn‚Äôt shaking out of my skin so I consider that a win. I got an uber there, and a bus back. I think that helps - it means my most anxious riddled part I can sit alone in the back of a car. That‚Äôs not sustainable long term and I don‚Äôt want that to become my go to, but I think while I get back into the swing of it I‚Äôm not going to beat myself up if I uber there. I will allow myself to beat myself up if I uber HOME however. But I‚Äôm generally okay with that point. And I‚Äôve been leaving a bit earlier to avoid the peak commute time, the bus home today was still super full but it was okay. It‚Äôs the thought of having to sit on the top level and then making it down the steps in time and idk anyway. Today I got a seat right next to the doors so I felt good. I had to sit next to a lady for about half of the trip which was okay. I‚Äôm so difficult to please - I don‚Äôt want anyone to sit down next to me but equally if they don‚Äôt sit down I feel like I‚Äôve repulsed them. So. Hm. Anyway. The day itself was okay - I didn‚Äôt go get a coffee or anything from the kitchen, mainly because I felt kind of nauseous so didn‚Äôt want one of their rank coffees on top of that. I met mum for lunch as she‚Äôs working in town today and we‚Äôre basically office neighbours so we went to a cafe and I got avocado on toast with a poached egg which was yum. She got the same. It was only about 35 minutes as she had to get back to work and I wanted to get back to prep for a meeting anyway. It was nice. I transferred her $$$ for my lunch, well $20 so not the full lunch as I think it was $24 but anyway. I don‚Äôt like feeling like a financial leech to anyone. And anyway it was all fine. 

Last night I had an iota of hope blossom inside of me because he said ‚Äúthe next thing we watch‚Ä¶‚Äù and it made me feel like him ending things is not in fact imminent. I was starting to wonder oh maybe he‚Äôll align it with the end of this show or something, this is the pathetic level of thinking I‚Äôm at like who aligns a ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù with a SHOW ?! No one. But it felt plausible in my head. Even though it‚Äôs the dumbest thing ever. The fact him saying that even making me think is utterly RIDICULOUS but that‚Äôs how uncertain I feel lately. Anyway. It made me feel hopeful. 

I wish I looked different. 

I want to talk to him about children vs not having children, but he‚Äôs probably the last person I should talk to at this stage because I don‚Äôt want him swaying my choice. But he‚Äôs also the person I want to talk about it with the most because I value his opinion and thoughts more than anyone else‚Äôs. I wish I could ask his take. But I can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs if I even end up with him. But even if I don‚Äôt, I still want his thoughts regardless. Oh well. 

I *really* wish I looked different. Better. Pretty. 

Tonight I am going to trial leaving my phone on the other side of the room. That way I can‚Äôt snooze because I have to get up to turn it off and if I‚Äôm up I may very well remain up, here‚Äôs hoping. I‚Äôm saying this because I need to be up for an earlier than normal meeting, blimmin time zones. It‚Äôs not even early let‚Äôs be fair but for ME it‚Äôs early. 

I feel nauseous. And ugly. 

Everything feels so wrong.

Chapter 1  
  
The day before our engagement, my fianc√© Logan Blackwood bankrupted my family's company, stole all the money, and fled abroad with his first love.  
  
It drove my parents to jump off a building when debt collectors came after them.  
  
Heartbroken, I went to the Blackwood family demanding justice, but instead, his parents drugged me and put me on a yacht with gamblers. Dozens of men dragged me into a private room and filmed me in countless humiliating videos.  
  
In my moment of despair, as I prepared to jump into the sea, my fianc√©'s older brother, Reed Blackwood, suddenly appeared, becoming my only salvation.  
  
Then he cleared away all obstacles and taught everyone who had bullied me a lesson.  
  
He said he'd admired me for a long time and didn't care about my past.  
  
To marry me, he even moved out of the Blackwood family and threw me the wedding of the century.  
  
Five years into our marriage, I boarded that yacht again as Mrs. Blackwood.  
  
But I accidentally overheard him talking with his buddy.  
  
""Reed, for Gia, you didn't hesitate to drug Daphne and destroy her innocence. Now that she's finally pregnant, you're bringing her back here to replay the old script. Don't you think that's too cruel?""  
  
""Cruel? I promised Gia that only her children would inherit the Blackwood fortune. The bastard in Daphne's belly can't stay. Besides, a filthy woman like her doesn't deserve to bear my child.""  
  
""Have those men arrived? Just like five years ago, don't hold back‚Äîrape her until she miscarries. Remember, don't let her catch on.""  
  
Hah! Turns out my so-called salvation was just another pit of hell.  
  
What I thought was love was just an elaborate lie he crafted.  
  
Well then, I'll help him get exactly what he wants.  
  
\---  
  
On the deck, Reed Blackwood faced the sea breeze, his voice dripping with blood and regret.  
  
""Since Gia has chosen Logan, all I can do is remove every obstacle for her. Bankrupting the Andrews family was just the first step. Consider their money a wedding gift from me to them.""  
  
""Daphne is tainted now. Someone like her doesn't deserve to bear my child.""  
  
His friend beside him frowned, looking uncomfortable.  
  
""But you hired those men who dragged her into that room five years ago. You know better than anyone that Daphne's been battling depression because of that incident. You've been by her side through her therapy. To repeat this nightmare‚Äîhow will she survive afterward?""  
  
Reed's expression hardened as he lit a cigarette.  
  
Through the swirling smoke, he spoke coldly: ""If necessary, I'll continue to accompany her through therapy. Whatever happens, her child cannot be born.""  
  
""I promised Gia that I would never let Daphne pose any threat to her.""  
  
""But what about Daphne? Does she deserve to be manipulated like this? She's innocent. She loves you so much. How could you just‚Ä¶""  
  
Before he could finish, Reed cut him off sharply: ""Enough. I said do it according to my plan. Blame her for showing up at the wrong time.""  
  
""Give me the drug. I need to personally watch her drink it.""  
  
Seeing he couldn't be persuaded, his friend turned and left.  
  
Tears escaped my control, then the sea breeze carried them into the night sky.  
  
I hugged myself, trembling uncontrollably.  
  
Five years ago, Logan Blackwood bankrupted my family's company and fled overseas with all our money and Gia Rivers.  
  
My parents, cornered by debt collectors, chose to jump from a building.  
  
I went to the Blackwood mansion alone, seeking justice.  
  
Instead, I was drugged and sent onto this yacht, then became a tool for the sick games of high society.  
  
Dozens of men dragged me into a private room, recording countless humiliating videos.  
  
Desperate, I crawled to the deck, ready to end it all by jumping into the sea.  
  
That's when Reed Blackwood suddenly appeared, taking me into his arms, giving me my only warmth.  
  
He gently wiped away my tears and blood, and said:  
  
""Wait for me. I won't let anyone who hurt you get away with it.""  
  
That night, screams echoed throughout the yacht.  
  
My body developed a trauma response, haunted by nightmares.  
  
And it was him who stayed by my side. In those moments when I woke up terrified from nightmares, he would stroke my back, comforting me.  
  
He said he couldn't control his brother, but Logan owed me. He would repay that debt tenfold, a hundredfold.  
  
To give me a wedding, he broke ties with the Blackwood family and established his own business, declaring his love for me to the world.  
  
But in the end, five years of happiness was just a bubble. The man who saved me from the abyss was also the one who pushed me into hell.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I stumbled back to our suite.  
  
Reed saw my pale face and became anxious. He pulled me into his arms, gently patting my back like before.  
  
""What's wrong, darling? Did you remember something? Don't be afraid. I'm with you this time. Those people won't appear again.""  
  
""I had the doctor bring some medication for you. You can take it when the water cools down.""  
  
Looking at his pretend-gentle eyes, I said softly:  
  
""Reed, I don't want to take the medication anymore.""  
  
""I'm better now. I want to go home.""  
  
The warmth in his eyes cooled by several degrees. Then he playfully tapped my nose.  
  
""Be good, Daphne. Mental illness tends to recur. Taking your medication will help you recover faster.""  
  
""After taking it, you won't have nightmares anymore.""  
  
Before I could speak, he had already put the pill in my mouth.  
  
As the warm water went down, my body felt completely cold.  
  
As if certain I would quickly lose consciousness after taking the medicine, Reed didn't stay with me.  
  
He turned and hurriedly left the suite.  
  
I knew he was going to find those men from five years ago.  
  
The broken memories like a nightmare swept over me again.  
  
Cold sweat broke out all over my body, I collapsed on the floor, rolling in agony.  
  
As my consciousness faded, I felt warm lips on my forehead.  
  
""Good girl, Daphne. It'll be over soon. I'll wait for you to come out.""  
  
What followed was excruciating pain.  
  
Fresh blood continued to flow from below.  
  
Familiar sensations overwhelmed me.  
  
Countless rough hands moving across my skin.  
  
I don't know how long it was before I heard Reed's voice again.  
  
""Miscarried?""  
  
""Yes, but Mr. Blackwood, they didn't hold back. I think... they went too far. Miss. Andrews probably won't be able to conceive again.""  
  
""Well done. Double the payment. Go ashore to collect your money.""  
  
When I opened my eyes again, it was five hours later.  
  
Reed held my hand tightly in his, his eyes full of distress.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Daphne. I couldn't protect you.""  
  
""It was those men from five years ago. They found out you were here and came for revenge. We couldn't save the baby. The doctor says you probably won't be able to conceive again...""  
  
""Don't worry. I've caught all of them this time. They'll never appear again. Don't cry. No matter what happens, I'll stay by your side. It doesn't matter about the baby. I only need you.""  
  
I stared blankly at the floor.  
  
Too numb to even feel pain, I was the one who had suffered humiliation and lost my child. Yet he cried more bitterly than I did.  
  
His acting was superb, and I wasn't in the mood to expose him.  
  
After a while, when he fell silent, I slowly said:  
  
""You must be tired... from avenging me.""  
  
""Reed, you should rest. I'm fine.""  
  
Seeing I wasn't making a scene, he relaxed and closed his eyes, lying beside me. His breathing gradually steadied.  
  
I silently took his phone.  
  
Five years' marriage, this was the first time I'd unlocked his screen, but using Gia's birthday as the passcode.  
  
The social media app in the background hadn't been closed‚Äîonly one contact saved as ""Gia.""  
  
Opening it, I saw that from five years ago until now, they had never missed a day's ""good morning"" or ""good night.""  
  
Gia was overseas, but she sent Reed updates on her daily activities‚Äîwhether shopping, having coffee, or working at the office‚Ä¶ no matter what she sent, Reed never let her down‚Äîone photo earned a $100,000 reward.  
  
This was how Reed had stayed involved in her life until ten thousand photos filled the album.  
  
But whenever I tried to share something with him, he always said:  
  
""Daphne, I'm in a meeting. Let's talk when I get off work.""  
  
To please Gia, gifts from the mainland had to go through multiple channels to reach her.  
  
Auction orders filled dozens of pages on the screen.  
  
Many brands looked familiar. Reed had given me versions of them too.  
  
But they were just the free gifts that came with the items he bought for Gia at auctions.  
  
The latest video in the album was from five hours ago‚Äîthe thumbnail showed me unconscious after taking the drug, surrounded by dozens of familiar faces.  
  
My fingers kept trembling, unable to press play.  
  
Finally, I simply hit delete and turned off his phone.  
  
Reed, since our beginning started with a lie. Then this time, let me end it with a lie.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Without further hesitation, I messaged my best friend, asking her to wait with a lifeboat on the other side tomorrow night.  
  
I also downloaded a divorce agreement template, added it to an email, and set it to send later.  
  
After finishing everything, I noticed Reed sweating in his sleep, keeping murmuring:  
  
""Daphne... no, you can't be hurt.""  
  
""Daphne!""  
  
When he opened his eyes, he pulled me into his arms like he'd found something precious.  
  
Our chests pressed together, but our heartbeats were out of sync.  
  
After a moment, he came back to his senses from the nightmare.  
  
""Thank God you're okay.""  
  
Similar scenes had happened many times before.  
  
I used to think it was because he loved me so deeply, feeling my pain as his own.  
  
But now I realized it was just pretense, just exceptional acting.  
  
I lowered my head, letting him hold and comfort me.  
  
""I'll go get you some food. Wait for me, okay?""  
  
Reed had barely left when I followed him.  
  
He didn't go to the dining room but headed to a private suite downstairs.  
  
As soon as he entered, a slender arm wrapped around his shoulder, pulling him inside.  
  
Standing outside the door, I heard their breathing quicken.  
  
Reed said with restraint:  
  
""Finally decided to come back?""  
  
Gia smiled radiantly, rising on her tiptoes to kiss him on the lips.  
  
""If I didn't come back soon, I was afraid you might really fall in love with Daphne.""  
  
""I heard you used your old tricks again? She's been your wife for five years and just got pregnant. Honey, how could you be so heartless...""  
  
""If Daphne finds out, she'll want to eat me alive.""  
  
Reed chuckled, holding her tighter against the door.  
  
""I told you, as long as I'm around, no one will touch you.""  
  
""As long as you're happy, I'll use her flesh and blood to pave your way.""  
  
A passing server noticed me and exclaimed:  
  
""Mrs. Blackwood! What are you doing here? You haven't recovered yet‚Äîyou shouldn't be walking around! Mr. Blackwood will have our pay docked if he finds out!""  
  
""Let me take you back.""  
  
As this happened, wealthy passengers walking by looked at me with contempt.  
  
""So that's Mrs. Blackwood? The one who was just dragged into a room by over a dozen men? I heard she's been used twice now. Mr. Blackwood must be something special to still stomach her.""  
  
""Twice? It's way more than that! One time with over a dozen men‚Äîdo the math! Mr. Blackwood's got enough green on his head to knit a sweater! What a blind fool to go for a woman like that! I'd throw up just sleeping next to her.""  
  
""Who knows if she was forced or willing? Maybe she's no good herself. Why else would she be the only one who keeps getting into trouble on this huge yacht? This time her child was literally fucked out of her‚Äîthat kid would've been unlucky to have her as a mother anyway!""  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
I stood there, barely able to stay on my feet.  
  
Reed heard the commotion and came out, his face instantly turning pale when he saw me.  
  
He caught me just before I collapsed.  
  
""Daphne? What are you doing here?""  
  
""Are you feeling unwell? I'll take you back.""  
  
I remained silent, looking past him at Gia.  
  
Afraid I'd notice, Reed quickly explained:  
  
""Don't overthink this. Gia just got back from overseas, and I happened to run into her, so I came to check on her.""  
  
""That incident was five years ago. Gia's been staying overseas because she was afraid you'd be upset. Now that she's finally back... well, we're all family. Why don't we...""  
  
""Don't worry. As long as I'm around, that bastard Logan won't step foot through our door.""  
  
I knew what he wanted to say. Rather than being put on the defensive, I decided to take the initiative. At least I could maintain some dignity.  
  
""It's all in the past. I won't bring it up again.""  
  
The onlookers who had been mocking me scattered when Reed appeared.  
  
""Hey, sis, long time no see,"" Gia smiled at me, flashing the limited-edition watch on her wrist.  
  
I nodded silently, suppressing my hurt:  
  
""I just came out for some air. Since you're busy, I'll head back. I don't want to cause you any trouble.""  
  
Reed thought I was angry and followed me all the way back to our suite. His eyes reddened with concern.  
  
Watching him so desperate to act, with desire still evident in his eyes, I almost wanted to laugh.  
  
To make me step aside for Gia, he drugged me and ruined my life.  
  
Now he got what he wanted‚ÄîI was living in disgrace, unable to hold my head up.  
  
Who was he putting on this show for?

1km9jmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1km9jmc/australia_vs_new_zealand_thoughts_from_my_years/,Australia vs New Zealand - Thoughts from my years in each country.,"I have been living in both Australia and New Zealand since COVID, working in both for various companies and traveling in both. Have made a bunch of friends in both countries and it's been awesome! I come from the UK, but have traveled all around the place.  


I saw someone posted a similar one for part of NZ, so just thought I would give my two cents on some really random observations between the two of you...... there will be lots of generalizations so take this all with a grain of salt...

* **People:** I don't think a lot of people from each country realize just how similar you both are..... like... it's kind of scary how similar you both are. There seems to be a lot of ""We do this"" without people realizing you both do it.
* **Meat:** New Zealand. Guessing it's grain fed vs grass... as Australian grass feed is basically the same as normal NZ. Definitely more variety in Australia however if you are in to eating random shit. 
* **Fruit:** Australia has more variety and for longer periods. But New Zealand fruit seems to have so much more flavor for some reason. 
* **General Food/Drink Selection:** Australia, not even close.
* **General selection/shopping:** Australia again by a long way. Granted you can order most things online these days without an issue. 
* **Chocolate:** New Zealand: By a very very long way. Purely for having whittakers. 
* **Cost of Living:**  Australia generally.. \*however\* it's really not as far apart as a lot of people seem to think when it comes to groceries etc.  Australia also has an awful lot more ""Other"" costs than NZ. While petrol is far cheaper for example, car rego etc is 10x the price. Cars are also far more expensive.
* **Pies/Cakes/Bakery food:** New Zealand by a lot. This was strange, was expecting more from Australia.
* **Booze:** New Zealand. FAR more variety and far more of a ""Experimental"" mindset.. can get everything you can imagine at awesome quality. Also far cheaper in NZ. (Except wine which seems to be cheaper in Australia)
* **Scenery:** While Australia has some utterly fantastic scenery.. New Zealand really takes first place on this one, it has everything and all so close to each other.
* **Weather:** 100% depends on what you like. While Australia by far has more sunshine... some of that sunshine can be..... like standing in a large air fryer. 
* **Driving:** You are both 100% shit as each other. New Zealanders seem to want to get as close to your ass as possible. Australians seem to not understand how indicators and lanes work. 
* **Salaries:** Australia easy, however the ""Higher you get"" it seems to even out a lot more. Manual labor pays a lot more in Australia. Plus super etc.
* **Public Transport:** Australia easy. However I actually did find a lot of ""Rural"" NZ was better than ""Rural"" AU for public transport.
* **Work Life:** New Zealand. Seems a lot more friendly and together. Australian work culture is brutal and can wear you out from what I have experienced and heard this from many people who have worked in both countries.
* **Roads:** Australia easy... however none of them actually seem to help get anywhere faster.
* **Traffic:** New Zealand. Far less traffic everywhere.
* **Cheese:** Australia.... honestly by quite a bit. 
* **Coffee:** New Zealand. By a very long way. 
* **Houses:** Australia. Just seem of far better quality and far cheaper... although‚Ä¶ use more carpet Australia!
* **Snow Sports:** New Zealand, by a VERY long way. Just better and also far cheaper.
* **Inclusivity:** Cities in both countries are the same.. however when you get rural... New Zealand and not even close. Rural Australia can be like... the 1400s....
* **Nationalism:** Australians in generally seem FAR more ""Nationalistic"" than New Zealand. 
* **Location:** New Zealand felt a lot more ""Remote"" than Australia.
* **Crime:** I honestly felt safer in New Zealand, however that wildly depending on where I was. The most \*unsafe\* I felt was in the Northern part of Australia. I also felt pretty unsafe in Rotorua.
* **Formality:** Bit of a random one, I found Australia to be a lot more formal in everything, New Zealand was a lot more chill. Not sure if either is better. Will depend on the person. 

**Funny Observation:** New Zealanders living in Australia seem to think NZ is an absolute shithole. Australians in New Zealand seem to think AU is an absolute shithole. Yet both seem very proud of being an ""Aussie"" or a ""Kiwi"". It's very very strange...

**Biggest Difference:** Probably just how ingrained New Zealand is with the Maori Culture and how the Maori people are part of everything. Australia feels like ""We are trying to put in the bare minimum...""

  
But yes, fantastic places, I don't think either of you know just how lucky you are to live where you do.

  
**Note:** I can't seem to post this in the Australian sub as there is a time limit re new accounts, but if someone could post this there that would be great! :)

So here's a wild thought... Do you ever wonder if we're just part of some cosmic dream? I mean, what if the universe is really just a bored, giant consciousness, dozing off and dreaming us up like its own version of Netflix? ü§Ø

Sometimes, when I'm lying awake at night, I start to think about how vast everything is and how little we actually know about what‚Äôs ""real."" Like, what if when we fall asleep, we‚Äôre actually tapping into other dreams‚Äîit‚Äôs like jumping channels in this big universal mind, and deja vu is just a glitch in the cosmic TV, ya know?

I know it sounds kinda bizarre, but maybe we're all dream characters, just waiting for the universe to change the storyline. And if that's true, what do you reckon the universe would dream about when it wants to unwind? Maybe it's weird alien soap operas or celestial sitcoms. üòÇ

Anyway, just a whimsical thought during my afternoon coffee. Would love to hear what you dream about. Are we creators or just some far-off figment? Hmm...

Cheers to pondering life's oddities!

1km9cxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1km9cxk/i_saw_myself_on_every_camera/,I Saw Myself on Every Camera,"I work nights as a mall security guard‚Äîgraveyard shifts in a forgotten carcass of flickering neon and cracked linoleum. For three years, it was uneventful. Until last night.

At 2:03 a.m., I saw myself on Camera 7, walking past the pretzel kiosk. Same uniform. Same slouch. But I was in the office. Watching. The timestamp was live. I radioed out‚Äînothing but static, laced with a faint, whining undertone. Then the figure turned and looked into the lens. Into me. His eyes were too big. His smile too wide‚Äîskin stretching as if pulled by unseen hooks. He raised a hand, fingers twisting like tendrils, and pointed straight through the camera.

The air thickened. Metallic. Electric. Then the feed fractured into a storm of colors and shapes that made my skull throb. Coffee spilled across the floor, forming spirals that looked like galaxies. I clicked through the other cameras.

Camera 12: me again, at the entrance, head bent unnaturally, shadow writhing like eels.  
Camera 4: me, rocking on a bench, fingers sunk into melting knees.  
Camera 9: me, pacing in spirals, leaving trails of glowing footprints.

Dozens of me, each wrong in new ways‚Äîcrawling, whispering, bending. One in the fountain, water climbing upward. One in the electronics store, limbs snapping like broken furniture. All the timestamps dissolved into twitching glyphs.

Then, every feed showed me‚Äîin the office‚Äîstaring at the screens. Behind each version, a towering shadow, its edges fraying into coiling void. And somehow, I felt it reach inside my head.

I ran.

The mall was‚Ä¶ different. Corridors twisted like intestines. Walls pulsed like breathing flesh. Clocks dripped from the ceiling, spinning in directions that made no sense. My reflections in storefronts screamed silently, faces melting into fractals of black light. I reached the food court‚Äînow a cathedral of floating tables and thorned chairs. In the center stood another me‚Äîskin translucent, veins glowing like constellations. He turned. Eyes like starfields.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late,‚Äù he said. His voice was layered‚Äîmy voice, but multiplied, distorted. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here. The ones who are you. The ones who aren‚Äôt. Time‚Äôs a tapestry‚Äîand you‚Äôre the tear.‚Äù

I ran as reality folded into itself. Hallways looped. Doors led to voids. Another me grabbed my arm‚Äîhis hand like frozen roots, skin sinking into mine. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at the stars,‚Äù he whispered, before collapsing into color. I tore free‚Äîskin peeling in ribbons of light.

I found my car. The night sky was a wound. Stars pulsed like infected eyes. The pavement reflected not me‚Äîbut dozens. One wept. One grinned with too many teeth. I drove. The road stretched into infinity.

Now I‚Äôm home. I think.

The mirrors show someone almost like me. My security feed shows me in the hallway‚Äîmy silhouette writhing, eyes glowing. And behind me, something vast, its shape fractal and impossible.

There are too many footsteps in the hall. All mine.

1km9cfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1km9cfe/can_someone_tell_me_what_this_is/,Can someone tell me what this is,"I (19F) broke up around 2 months ago with a toxic ex. Just some background information, I was manipulated, gaslighted constantly, even slapped across my face in that relationship. I endured it for a year and a half until I couldn‚Äôt anymore. I was at a point where I could not trust anyone. I was r*ped by a physician, and my ex blamed me - this was near the end of the relationship. In my attempts to answer his questions in regard to the I incident (I.e the police report I filed, what the police did, the details of the incidents), I got slapped across my face. About 2 months later I met this guy (22F) at a socials for a school club i was in. Now, I‚Äôve never been to a club or a party before , I don‚Äôt drink, am super introverted. But this guy seemed really friendly and we began talking. It didn‚Äôt feel like he had any weird intentions. Just having him around after being so isolated really made me happy. His little gestures like delivering me free coffee etc made me really like him at first as a friend. Another reason was he seemed really easy to talk to. For some reason, I could never open up and truly un-apologetically be myself until he showed up. I remember my ex calling me 2 days before my finals and completely ruined my day, and this friend would show up to study with me, even wait outside my therapist office until I‚Äôm done, to hangout with me. He met me while I was at my worse, yet stayed and looked after me (even though I had just met him for like 2 days). Within the span of a week we spent quality time together just chatting and relating to each others life experiences. At some point later, we would call for over 3 hours on the phone, and he would never be the person to end the call (we live in different provinces, I had to move home after I completed my school year when I finished the finals). This whole thing has been ongoing for about a month. 


At some point, for the first time in my life I confessed. Over text, I told him about my feelings. This is because I feel like the way I have been texting and the amount of attention I gave him was more than what I would do for a friend. I didn‚Äôt want to give off any vibes like I was giving mixed signals, and I also just wanted to be honest and also know his thoughts. Unexpectedly, he told me he feels the same way. From then on, nothing really happened. This is where I‚Äôm really confused. We would say things like ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù, ‚Äú I really like you‚Äù, we would call for hours, we would say Goodmorning and goodnight everyday. He would even tell me where he‚Äôs at and when he‚Äôs home (I have never ever asked for it). Nothing more than this though. 

However, all of this is happening over long distance right now (the time zone is also different). The confession happened around a week after I came home over text.

I‚Äôm looking for a committing relationship, but I also don‚Äôt have that much experience with one since I‚Äôve only been in one myself. Does anyone know where this is going ? He is flying over to where I live in a month, and he would tell me everyday how he excited he is to see me, etc. He would remember the smallest details about me that even I forget sometimes. If I was insecure he would make me feel safe by reassuring me he had nothing to hide from me and that I could ask him anything and he‚Äôll answer honestly. 

What really also make me feel conflicting is there are people I trust around me telling me he just plays around a lot, and that when he gets bored of a girl he‚Äôll move on and ghost the previous one. When I confronted him he had proved to me of the rumours and the misunderstanding. I guess as we hung out over the phone he was able to tell my insecurity when I asked him if he talked to other girls the same way he talked to me. He instantly said no, and that he is very serious about me. 

I really don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I really like this person, I would love to know more about them, and spend more quality time together, but I‚Äôm not sure what his intention is. Also, I notice that he‚Äôs been texting me less and less, but maybe it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs on a vacation with his family ? The usual Goodmorning and goodnight are gone. But we still text everyday, and he‚Äôd send me pictures and say things like I miss you. This in addition to what my friends keep on telling me is making me really unsure of what to do.

Or a coffee machine that starts brewing your preferred blend as it notices a change in your sleep patterns suggesting you‚Äôre waking up earlier than usual.

Beyond simple convenience, this could translate to meaningful improvements in health and well-being. Smart homes could monitor gait and posture for early signs of mobility issues in elderly residents, proactively notifying caregivers. AI could learn your individual circadian rhythm and optimize lighting to combat seasonal affective disorder.

Though, this level of personalization also raises serious privacy concerns. Who owns this data? How is it secured? What safeguards are in place against potential misuse, like insurance companies using it to adjust premiums or even advertisers targeting you with hyper-personalized, potentially manipulative ads?

1:  Threatening to ‚Äúimpound my bike‚Äù when I was a teenager because I was ‚Äúcycling on the wrong side of the road‚Äù
‚Äî> This threat was occurred back in 2008 during my senior year of high school over several days where the same officer pulled me over multiple nights in a row while riding home from my telemarketing job (I got off at 10 pm). 

2:  I was walking through a residential area to visit my older brother and future sister-in-law and was carrying a Tupperware container of BBQ pork to share and a police officer pulled over and demanded to see what was in the Tupperware. I informed him it was BBQ pork to which he repeated to show him so I did and to his surprise it was in fact BBQ pork. 

3:  Pulled over while walking due to claims of ‚Äúsuspicious behavior‚Äù being reported plus claims of graffiti. (This had happened a couple of times in childhood). 

4:  Police coming on to my property because of my ‚Äúillegal‚Äù fire pit. This is double funny/infuriating  because it‚Äôs a college campus‚Äôs police officer. When I went to file a complaint the next day they called the fire marshal only for both them and I to be corrected on fire relegations. Of course the officers didn‚Äôt apologize but thankfully the fire marshal could see that I wasn‚Äôt some sort of nefarious ne‚Äôr-do-well and actually gave some useful feedback when I explained I wasn‚Äôt intentionally creating ash using garden debris, gathered sticks, and brown cardboard to balance the Ph levels of my compost pile because I receive massive amounts of coffee ground the the campus coffee shop. 

I feel like a writing a book now, some of these are ancient history and some more recent. My intention as stated is to inquire if anyone else struggles with police pestering you for existing?

So building off that we see we've pretty much confirmed the breakout from the consolidation phase and now entering the territory of ONLY UP.

Look at this chart and tell me it doesnt bring a tear to your eye:

https://preview.redd.it/i9zzs5j98p0f1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=01842bdc699935578b16436f9aedb19bec992f69

  
Kendu is looking beautiful right now and I believe there will be no stopping us. We've shown crazy strength in the way we've pretty much followed ETHs movements, and because some are speculating an altseason, theres no reason for this to stop now. 

But yea thats pretty much it for the chart, super good day for Kendu and it's looking like it's going to be a super good next couple of months. 

So let me explain to you what KENDU is if this is your first time hearing about it:

The project has changed the lives of many thousands of community members.

A Kendu (can-do) attitude has made countless people get up off the couch, out of retirement, and out on the streets building under the brand umbrella.

The Kendu community has built:

\- A Kendu Games Studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs  
\- Kendu beers  
\- A Kendu board game  
\- Kendu energy drinks  
\- Kendu events company in India  
\- Kendu events presence USA  
\- Kendu sports brand (You Kendu It)  
\- Kendu eSports team  
\- Kendu coffee brand  
\- Kendu sweets, chocolates, and spirits  
\- Much more in the works

Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Imagine a permissionless brand behemoth that anyone can build under, immediately tapping into a scaling CaaS (Community-as-a-service), where the treasury is voluntarily, not contractually, is replenished by those building businesses under Kendu, and that treasury is transparently used for grants for products, businesses, or initiatives the community wants to build with Kendu. Almost akin to an L1.

And of course kendu is still a memecoin so everything relates back to the Kendu dog on the coin for those wondering. I believe Kendu will become the industry standard, forcing future coins to start innovating rather than trying the same structure of the typical coin we see today: create some bland narrative, start getting KOLs to call it (mad apes, pow etc... people who only want supply) and then proceed to run the coin for a week before leaving it.

You can Kendufy anything. And everything will be Kendufied.

How the Rubik‚Äôs Cube Taught Me to Be a Better Parent

Having children means being a puzzle-solver in ways big and small.

By Samantha Mann
May 13, 2025

Puzzling, to me, has always been an activity for people who lack legitimate hobbies.  The thought of assembling 500 jigsawed pieces of cardboard to recreate the ‚ÄúMona Lisa‚Äù has never been my idea of time well spent. And word games? I‚Äôd rather scrub the F train clean with a dirty sock than try to decipher the riddle ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a five-letter synonym for ‚Äòamalgamation‚Äô?‚Äù Remember the O.G. Windows puzzle game Minesweeper? I clicked aimlessly at those gray squares until the board exploded.

But then I had children, and navigating your way through a problem is a primary activity of parenting. In some ways I had to become the ultimate puzzle master. Bring me a hungry tummy or skinned knee, and I can conjure a solution. If my 5-year-old son was bored, I could remind him of his ongoing Lego project, or hand him an empty Amazon box to decorate. If he was scared, I could hug him and tell him the Jim Carey version of the Grinch is fake and lives only inside the TV. I‚Äôd grown accustomed to these straightforward needs. Then, one day, he added a literal puzzle to my never-ending to-do list: a Rubik‚Äôs Cube.

‚ÄúMommy, solve this,‚Äù he demanded, assuming I could do so. I took the cube from his hand and noticed that his fist was significantly less doughy than it was a year earlier. ‚ÄúOf course I can fix it,‚Äù I said. For a few minutes, I twisted the layers around and around, listening to the plastic clicking and clacking. Naturally, none of the colors lined up. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if someone can help,‚Äù I said, opening my laptop. My son snuggled up close to me on the couch with his ever-lengthening limbs. I searched for remaining spots of baby fat on him as I researched Rubik‚Äôs Cube tutorials on YouTube. A pimply teenager walked us through ‚ÄúThe Easiest 10-Minute Rubik‚Äôs Cube Lesson,‚Äù demonstrating specific processes to tackle each side. Over and over, I fumbled the righty and lefty algorithms. I replayed the video at least 50 times, but by bedtime I hadn‚Äôt made any headway.

With the cube still unsolved, I tucked my son into bed. No flash of disappointment registered on his face as I apologized for my lack of proficiency in enigmatology. In my own bed I continued manipulating the cube. The process, to my surprise, had an addictive quality. Rotating the sections and occasionally aligning the right colors felt like mastering the right steps in a dance ‚Äî although, in my case, it was more of a drunken stagger than a waltz.

But I was determined to keep trying, to waltz. After all, I had always been my son‚Äôs capable fixer. As he has aged, his needs have become more complex. We‚Äôve transitioned from how to make a boo-boo better to pondering questions like ‚ÄúWhere was I before I was born?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm lonely after you and mom die?‚Äù He needed me to shift away from the physical stage of parenting to an existential one for which I lacked sufficient answers. Maybe the cube would let me hold onto the concrete for a little while longer.

When he woke up the next morning, he asked if I had solved it. And so, before finishing my first cup of coffee, I picked the cube back up and once again tried to untangle it. I shifted the cube in various directions between running baths and folding laundry. ‚ÄúAre you even watching this?‚Äù my wife asked as we sat in bed watching 50-year-old women yell at one another in designer gowns on our favorite show, and I had hardly looked up from the cube. As parents of young children, one of the few moments we have together, just the two of us, is the too-brief hour after they‚Äôre in bed and before one of us passes out. The cube was interfering with that sacred time ‚Äî but I had to get it right.

We were into our second week without a solved cube when, instead of answering a work email, my hands expertly maneuvered and something in my brain snapped into place. I realized I was finally going to crack it ‚Äî I was just twists away. I shifted the squares two more times and then, finally: I solved it. Stunned and self-congratulating, I picked up my son an hour early from his after-school program with the completed cube in hand.

He beamed and cheered. Then, immediately, he scrambled all my hard work. Within seconds, I watched the perfect coordination dissolve into a primary-color hodgepodge. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it again!‚Äù he shouted. It was a devastating reminder of a lesson I had already learned: I was a mere stagehand in a production centered on his life. Yes, being a parent means being a puzzle-solver in ways big and small. At times you have to do things that feel hard ‚Äî hard because you‚Äôre tired or lack patience or simply don‚Äôt know how. But being a parent also means that none of it is about you. It‚Äôs about scooting over and focusing all that tired mental and physical and emotional energy on someone else. Occasionally it pays off and you do something that previously felt impossible, like getting everyone to bed without yelling ‚Äî or solving a Rubik‚Äôs Cube.

Still, I love working on the cube ‚Äî beginning with a mess and gradually shaping it into a microcosm of order. Unlike with child-rearing, there is no wondering if I made the right choice. As my son grows, so will his problems, evolving with an intricacy too nuanced for YouTubers to resolve. I won‚Äôt be able to fix all of them, but the Rubik‚Äôs Cube did unlock a new parenting hypothesis: Maybe all I can reasonably hope to do is show up, try, fail and change course.

It feels so, so good to say that and have it be true, but as of three days ago, everything is finally paid off and we've made our way back onto solid ground. 

Almost two years ago, I made a post here about my(28F) fiance(28M) wanting to split things 50-50, and my offer of compromising on lifestyle changes. As it turned out, he was off his meds and had managed to get himself into some serious debt, a little under 100k, trying to provide a life that we could not afford on a combined 155k a year. Things were rough. I almost left him a few times. But we have finally, finally, finally made it through to the other side. 

I handle the finances. 100% of the finances. I give him a budget for buying coffee. It wasn't fun, but in exchange he started doing more of the housework, so it evens out. We moved from our over-the-top apartment into a shared living situation, which, while not ideal, was leagues better than my initial plan of getting a trailer. We have roommates, but they're on another floor, so it's not too bad, and we have our own bathroom which was my only real stipulation. We've lived like we're a 70k a year couple, doing actual 50-50 finances, and every extra penny he's made has gone directly to paying off the debt. 

We sold the cars, obviously. Traded them in for a nice used Ford Maverick and a Vespa. That helped a lot. There have been no more lavish vacations or over-the-top restaurants with $500 price tags. It was rough for my fiance at first. He's always been very much a rich boy, and I think losing that as an identity was difficult for him. That being said-- he's gotten \*so creative\* lately, it's been amazing to see. He will make me things if he can't buy me things, and we've started cooking together instead of having me do almost all of it. Our room is covered in the things he's made for me, and it's really lovely. 

We're still in love. We're still going strong. And we can finally, finally, finally start actually planning our wedding again. We're gonna get our own place first, but the wedding is next on the list after that. I'm so glad that we stuck with this, and being on the other side is the greatest feeling in the world. 

Thank you to everyone who offered advice. <3 I don't know how things would have ended up if I hadn't had the courage of my convictions, and I'm genuinely grateful to those who directed me to Dave Ramsey and Caleb Hammer. Y'all are awesome!!

I've struggled with sudden sleepiness and brain fog when exposed to non food triggers in the past, most notably, mold. But since I've been paying closer attention, I've noticed it has also been after I have things like kombucha, alcohol, even coffee depending on how full my bucket is. Our family eats a lot of spicy + Mexican fusion dishes, and things that I love, like red rice with a spicy salsa and avocado will absolutely do me in. *sad trombone*

Today, it was a grilled turkey sandwich with tomatoes on it, which are a big trigger. I don't know how I didn't see it before. Within 30 minutes of eating my sandwich, I wasn't only sleepy, I also felt dazed out, unable to focus and think straight, that familiar brain fog that happens when I'm really, really overloaded. It's almost startling because it's such a shift in functioning. Not the first time it happened, but enough for me to truly clock the pattern.

I've been in a slump recently so it's been hard to stick to non trigger foods, but this was my sign to really check in with my body and try just a bit harder even when life is hard.

I saw her in the evening; she has beautiful eyes with long hair. Whenever she smiles, I feel like time paused instantly. I met her in the monsoon. I really don‚Äôt know how to start a conversation; I am very bad at that. She noticed me. I was having a panic attack as I told her there are a few people in the down station; everyone noticed, and I feel so embarrassed. Still, she is holding my hand. We don‚Äôt even talk; I can see tears in her eyes. Cold air touches our bodies. She is shaking; her lips are dry; maybe she needs to drink water, or maybe she is also panicked; that is the reason. fallen love is so beautiful. afterwards, we spent such nice time together, guzzling around the nice city town, corresponding my mind as I feel. Do I propose to her or does she not feel like that? The night passes. I wrote a letter to her; she still didn‚Äôt reply. Fate comes to attraction, going so deeply. now I realize I need the destruction. I can‚Äôt escape reality. The night goes so deeply; she didn‚Äôt reply. Someday later, my phone popped up; I saw the mail. She approved. I feel so blue. How come? Is that a delusion? Going through that mental state and finding that the girl is a treasure for me? We spend time together, hill station, sea; all we watch in our life. Tapestry on the way, seeing everything colorful. We planned to go for a hill track; we heard some of the fountain's names, but we didn‚Äôt know that we have to cross a long path to go there. We decided to go, but we didn‚Äôt know that the way was more complicated. I know we are not that much physically capable to achieve that milestone. We tried; we promised; we always held our hands together. We walk; she always sees my face and tells me, ""are you okay?"" Deep inside my heart, I give up. But still, when I saw her face, I feel that I can achieve that world for her. We crossed the whole way after 5 hours of hill track. She is so exhausted; she gave up; she can't come back. I just hold her hand and tell her that the way we have to pass together, life is more beautiful. We get that confidence together while we are passing that way together. She sat down on a way, telling me, ""Are you leaving me halfway?"" I just smiled and told her back, ""The way you see, there is only me,"" whispering in her ear. Meanwhile, some hours later, she actually gave up. She told me that I can't. I just held her on my back, telling her, ""Hold me tight; don‚Äôt move. I can't cross the whole road for you."" After the whole way, I just held her; eventually, we crossed. We just hired a van. I can see the beautiful moon over the sky. ""I just asked her, 'Do you know who is more beautiful, the moon or you?'"" She smiled. I told her, ""The moon is nothing compared to your beauty."" She glances and holds me tight. I feel so exhausted; I just fall asleep on her lap. Time goes so fast. Now that‚Äôs the time; I can only remember the memories. She left by any chances; soul getting despair; I can fly in the sky now, but with me, downtown to hill, I am still waiting for the train when the train arrived but still it doesn‚Äôt arrive at the station. I just waiting for that smile or someone calling by my name. In the winter again, I see the sky and moon; everything is faded away; no one understands the things. I am thinking that she is happy. Does she remember me? Sometimes, something is beautiful in a distance. I can feel her in every moment; I can feel her fragrance touches her skin, and even I talked with her last night. I feel exhausted; maybe her memories roaming around my mind in every hour; that's not a story everyone remembers, but that's the story I remember.",1,1747206694.0,Journaling,0,1.0,False

1km8zg5,https://i.redd.it/biz4j7146p0f1.jpeg,Kivotos: ¬øC√≥mo te dir√© Adios?,"**Day 1**

The Sun comes up, as it always does.

Over the horizon it always trespasses and disappears into his demesne.

Beautiful, it enchants us and every living being with it.

It is the first day, but it‚Äôs somehow different. I just know it.

The first day of the academic year in the Academy City, Kivotos. As part of the General Student Council, I must be at the general meeting between all Office leaders to discuss policy, city-wide administration, and enforce stability. Especially now. Since the former president vanished, delinquent activity festers in the shadows, and rumors of a coup stir beneath Chief Officer Rin‚Äôs fragile authority. As Chief of Defense, Shiranui Kaya, attending to this is my duty: as it always has been. 

I am the first to arrive, 15 minutes before meeting time, to an empty conference room bathed in the golden spill of the afternoon light. Glass encases the walls, a mirror and a window both. The perfect roundness of the room coupled with the uncanniness of the ambient gives the appearance of a modern panopticon. What the hell was wrong with the President, putting a giant statue in the middle of the table as one of her final acts in office; this room is already unsettling enough as is. Is it a solar clock? Maddeningly spinning around the office, its shadow casting the current time in a way reminiscent of ancient solar cults. Why do we worship the Sun anyways? Because it is a testament to industriousness and ruthlessness, all other stars in the sky get blotted out by the light of the Sun, turning the night into day. Some say that in the same way we live by the Sun, one day we will die by it; as it implodes on itself as a supernova, pulverizing earth as we know it.

Soon, the seats around me start to fill up: first to arrive is the Chief Officer Rin with an uncharacteristically diffident and apathetic countenance. Then comes Aoi with several stacks of documents artfully balanced, almost obscuring her face. Afterwards comes Haine, with Sumomo in tow. If meritocracy were to rule this land, there is no way any of them would be anywhere near the levers of power, but I digress. Finally, Ayumu trespasses the doors of this sterile space, dragging Momoka by the neck and coloring it red, ten minutes late and angrier than I‚Äôve ever seen her mild mannered self be. Chief Officer Rin, as I‚Äôve gone used to calling her instead of Acting President, clears her throat and starts the meeting. How does someone so kind, so gullible, decidedly not superhuman, exert such an effective facsimile of authority? At what point the fake thing becomes real in these cases? With a slight adjustment of her glasses, she starts speaking droll facts and updates as always.

‚Äú-so basing ourselves on the most recent projections from Treasurer Aoi; we would be seeing a stark reduction in taxpayer participation rate in the trimester following the President‚Äôs disappearance.‚Äù

I‚Äôve always thought about this when seeing the Chief Officer at work, that despite her total normality and incapacity to govern with the same transcendental authority of the President, she is like fish in the water where paperwork and dealing with people is involved. A flower of the bureaucracy I want to say, but I feel it‚Äôs not a good compliment.

‚ÄúAs a final announcement, I want to inform you that‚Ä¶ according to the people in the Research Department in collaboration with Millennium and Red Winter‚Äôs Astronomy Clubs have determined that the Sun is currently out of orbit and will collide with Earth in a matter of a week. I advise you all to enjoy the following days, and maybe make use of your paid leave days while possible. Meeting adjourned.‚Äù

Eh?

‚ÄúDo we have any countermeasures? Any response team available for the crisis? Isn‚Äôt this the time we all hold a joint operation with other schools like in-‚Äù

‚Ä¶what?

‚ÄúWith all due respect Chief, there are no countermeasures for a star larger than our planet falling on Earth that isn‚Äôt contingent on interstellar travel. Any recommendations are appreciated through the proper channels however. Make sure to read the transcript by Secretary Aoi as well.‚Äù

What did I just remember?

As quickly as it filled up, the conference room emptied with the same indifference as the eternal sunset that now colors the sky deep, blood red. I stay seated alone, in a daze and searching my thoughts and memories, once so securely anchored but now so fragile.


**Day 2**

The Sun sits still over Kousagi Park. Is it getting closer, mocking our everyday normality as it inches ever closer?

24 hours.

A day.

Isn‚Äôt it utterly meaningless without the Sun to indicate such cycles? What is a day without sunrise or sundown? The circadian rhythm knows not only of hours, but of stars.

The eyes know it and thus, the body does too. We can feel the anarchy, the lack of authority and we lose ourselves to our basest desires or meander in sad, aimless wandering.

Yet , the Sun remains impassive; it does not move.

The conclusion: we should aim to be farmers and chickens, starting work at sunrise and stopping at sunset, one that will never come. Perhaps an ostrich would be an agreeable choice as well.

We are condemned to a cycle with no rhythm, inscrutable by our current means of knowing. Ignorance is the only free will granted to us.

I find myself staring at my phone again.

‚ÄúGodammit, why is Sensei not picking up!‚Äù

Isn‚Äôt the job of an irresponsible adult like him to rally students together and make the impossible possible? I hate having to rely on methods like this, but the entire GSC is eerily apathetic to everything and seems completely resigned. The Acting President and her entire cabinet have already drafted their resignations and are set to announce them to the public through public media shortly.

I refuse to be summoned to participate in such a farce like a puppet.

Given recent reports and SOS calls from Red Winter directly to the GSC, I use my (soon to be abolished) job as Secretary of Defense to get as far away as possible from the chicanery of the DU. At the farthest ends of all of Kivotos, there is bound to be some respite from the circus that the world has become. Perhaps even the strong mindedness that characterizes the untreatable Secretary President Captain‚Ä¶ of everything Cherino will make this an amenable visit for me, obligations be damned.

I reach Red Winter by car, the road is usually covered in permafrost but now only ominous black cypress and pine needles ready for tinder dot the horizon as the soggy brown ground barely provides any contrast to the silent scenery. Only an unwelcome visitor is on the horizon, the unmoving Sun, gashing the Earth open and drying it of all life. Long gone are the days where going to Red Winter was an event even for the General Student  Council, where a 4 hour excursion could turn into an overnight stay due to inclement weather. However, even in its usual endless white of frosted pines and snow, Red Winter had never been this monotonous and baleful. The school offices come into view, but do not disturb this cosmic silence. There is no sign of struggle. 

Life appears as if frozen in time, public spaces still look lived in and abandoned in a hurry. Gun magazines, books, half eaten food and still full trash cans but no signs of movement beyond the stillness that refuses to budge. A single light is turned on, the Secretariat located in the heart of the gutted academy.

Only Secretary Cherino remains. 
Surrounded by nothing but castella pudding containers,
as the scorching light from the sky erases the history of Red Winter 
without even an ember.

‚ÄúStudent Council president, head of beautification, Great Leader; I‚Äôm having trouble remembering here, could you remind me what‚Äôs next, Acting President Kaya?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhere are all the other students?‚Äù

It‚Äôs the same nonchalance that everyone back in the DU, the same maddening inability to see the doom approaching. Or is it denial? Where the fuck do you think your subordinates went Cherino!? Are you short in your faculties as well!? Why can‚Äôt you see that which is obvious!??

‚ÄúDo you think that a coup is possible when there is no one left to rebel? Who am I to purge when not even Tomoe is here?‚Äù

There is a short silence as she licks her lips and flavors her next words to leave her mouth. She  looks through me towards someone my eyes cannot grasp. 

‚ÄúPurging the Sun sounds fun, however, would you assist me in this endeavour, Comrade!?‚Äù

Her legs kick below the table without a care in the world with the happy indolence of a child. Surrounded by foil wrappers and empty cups of pudding left there since God knows when, a veritable castle of plastic I cannot trespass, not anymore. 

The last revolutionary in a world devoid of people. How droll.

‚ÄúLeaving so soon? Could you get me some pudding on your way back?‚Äù

She says it so lightly. As if nothing‚Äôs wrong. As if I‚Äôm just late from a grocery run or an errand I was supposed to instinctively complete. Perhaps an errand of this nature might return some of the order lost in this world, bringing routine to the chaos enveloping me so suddenly.

But the notion is so repellent that nausea washes over me the moment I process it. I can‚Äôt bear to be in this place any longer, can‚Äôt stomach another grating statement. I turn and walk away with sudden urgency. 

Has castella pudding ever smelled so disgusting? No matter how much perfume I put on or how long I stare into the rearview mirror, I can‚Äôt seem to get it off. Are the ghosts of Red Winter made out of pudding? The radio broadcast of the dissolution of the GSC seems almost an afterthought.

I left Red Winter at 5:35 pm.

Today, during a bright 11:50 pm nighttime, Red Winter Academy ceased to be. 


**Day 3**

The scorched Earth whines as it is being plundered.

But She never fights back.

The Sun takes what it feels it‚Äôs owed, with no regard for the children left in the midst of the dispute.

A sunset of rage spilled in the endless canvas of the sky; blue, purple, orange, gold and *blood red*.

It almost makes one want to lay down, and die, watching stars bleed and fall from the sky in a dantesque spectacle.

Yet, here I am, still standing after the curtains have closed.

I can‚Äôt remember when I closed my eyes or when I opened them to another meaningless radio broadcast. We‚Äôre down: Red Winter, Abydos and Shanhaijing. 

This message will repeat until there are none to listen to it.

There is no one to greet me in the almost empty conference room except the unmoving statue in its midst, always looking towards the Sun and always smiling.  The soothing routine contrasts the unnerving tranquility of the hollow building. Only the empty echoes of a few moving automata like myself reverb, moved by habit not by will. Why did I even head towards here?

A faint memory of what once was? Ghostly hands moving me, like with puppet strings towards a path I‚Äôve tread before? Sitting in the seat that once belonged to the President, my hand trembles as it reaches for the phone, though there‚Äôs no one to stop it. A superhuman stands atop the mountain of humanity, ruling with an iron fist against all who dare reach the summit. This feels like taking over an ant hill. Even ants put up more of a fight than this farce.

‚ÄúGood morning, this is Shiranui Kaya, Acting President of the GSC, is Kaiser Industries on the line?‚Äù

But it all has to start from somewhere.

Kaiser Industries, officially a giant of manufacturing and research based where the Abydos desert used to be. Unofficially, it is the owner of the largest paramilitary in this side of Kivotos, offering aid at a time when neither of us had anything left to lose.  Neither of us holds any leverage over the other and it‚Äôs a last gambit for sure, but it‚Äôs one that must be taken if we are to resist; like ants we aspire to be. There is nothing else to do. This is what a superhuman like the President would have done, I am sure. I am sure.

‚ÄúYour terms are acceptable.‚Äù

Every second that passes, the world warps as the heat haze seems to eat up more and more of reality and the circle surrounding us grows ever smaller. Like bugs herded by the all consuming ray from a magnifying glass; ants, cockroaches and worms all must join hands towards the singular sand pit where all things converge.

‚Äú...‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn it!‚Äù

Nothing but static on the other end of the line. Neither Sensei nor the rest of the GSC even dignify me with an answer. Tell me, when do you think the bugs will bother to look up at the hand holding the looking glass?

I remain seated in a daze. Why did I believe that I could summon them? Did I let my recent success get to my head? Isn‚Äôt Sensei the type of person who would have already been here had he been available? Or is he also melting with our surroundings, disappearing into a puddle of intransigence like the entire GSC?

The statue in the middle of the room continues taunting me with my evident inferiority. Is that what a superhuman must do? Cure sudden and irreparable brain damage with the same expertise as a well trained neurosurgeon. Apparently the old president was also a polymath. The more you know.

‚ÄúPresident‚Ä¶ Are you alright?‚Äù

Behind me, I can hear one of my subordinates speak with the aseptic harmlessness of an automata. They contrast my despair by whirring to life again with a new purpose at their reach. Revitalized at the tentative prospect of a new tomorrow; they ignore the impending doom knocking at their door and inevitable failure against the whims of nature.

‚ÄúI wanted to ask when our new associates are arriving.‚Äù

The lights stay turned off, but the hustle and bustle of an everyday workday returns as a simile of what once was. There is impetus, momentum that was once lost. For how long will the cells and organs maintain homeostasis with the head cut off though?

‚ÄúWe move out tomorrow night at 11 o‚Äô clock sharp.‚Äù

Like a spell, silence befalls the room upon finishing the sentence, grave as it was authoritative. Behind me, there were none. I have to wonder, when was the last time I checked the clock?


**Day 4**

The wind ripens with the stagnant, boiling stench of the afternoon air that has long overstayed its welcome. 

The sky hasn‚Äôt welcomed a new day in a while. I wonder when it will bother enough to descend and find it, kidnapped by the Sun and left to rot in a trash bag. 

Light is cheap but time is free in this all Earth clearance sale. Takers, anyone? 

‚Äú500 credits for a single coffee.‚Äù

This vending machine, shrouded in the morose darkness of artificial light cowering behind shadows when faced by the full extent of the Sun‚Äôs glare. This vending machine that beeps and bops at the end of a hallway not mapped in the diagrams of the GSC building is not unlike SCHALE‚Äôs crafting chamber. This vending machine that sent a message to my phone that has long lost its charge telling me I had a free coffee to claim. 

‚ÄúIs it so fun to mess around with someone like me?‚Äù

A lukewarm coffee in a paper cup is all I get for my efforts and capital. Whoever put this machine here didn‚Äôt even bother to fill it with anything resembling quality coffee.

‚ÄúThank you! Please enjoy your coffee and have a great day!‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù

‚ÄúWith‚Ä¶ a touch of *creamy* ‚Ä¶. Milk‚Äù

A pure simulacrum of normalcy, this barely functioning vending machine carries the weight of those long gone halcyon days with every pump of sugar and spoonful of coffee. Maybe I should be more charitable to its efforts.

‚ÄúWho even bothers to refill and collect from a machine like this. Only the strangest things keep functioning here.‚Äù

I consider kicking the machine to air out my frustrations but before I can prepare myself for a punt, perplexingly, the mechanical hum of fans and spindles reacts to my words. Cold, inorganic life exhausts out of the piece of metal.

‚ÄúHave you finally found what you are searching for, young president?‚Äù

Confusion shouldn‚Äôt grip me at this point but it does, my internal dictionary does not suffice to describe what I sense. Paranormal activity or hallucination? As if. This doesn‚Äôt seem like any of the entities we fought back during the Ark of Atrahasis incident. Only a single abnormality comes to mind.

‚ÄúAre you the Shittim Chest?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not who you believe me to be. I usually summon those who I want to meet but this time, I took the initiative to see someone now that I have been freed from my physical shackles.‚Äù

This unwieldy vending machine? I am not sure how someone even brought it to this building. Was it to curb Momoka‚Äôs constant ‚Äúsnack breaks‚Äù that spanned hours on end? It's not like we don‚Äôt have several stores around the Sanctum Tower though.

‚ÄúI do not follow.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you not ask yourself questions, young president?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anymore, the power generator in this building has been gone for quite a few days, the only questions on my mind are how you continue powering on and why I continue waking up.‚Äù

The machine whirs on, coils whining, gas exhausting and a power supply carrying imaginary current working at full capacity. Was my response that satisfactory?

‚ÄúA purpose attained with no questions is no purpose at all.‚Äù

Guess not.

‚ÄúQuestions upon questions, the final absence of an answer proves its incomprehensibility and thus, its divinity.‚Äù

A logic exercise? At this moment? Fuck off. At least give me good coffee if you want me to think.

‚ÄúWhat is this final truth all these questions are meant to prove?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe existence of an absolute being, conscious of itself.‚Äù

Intellectual onanism over intellectual onanism, ignorance never breeds knowledge. Only superhuman intellect can achieve true power and consciousness, this discussion is not even worth having. Not like I have the energy to engage in it in good faith anyways.

‚ÄúWould an absolute being let a world end this way?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolute does not mean omnipotent or omniscient, it‚Äôs the blessing and curse of awareness. You think, therefore you are, and so is the world around you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what are *you*?‚Äù

‚ÄúA process, a recursive calculation full of more interrogations than answers despite having my datasheet available online. I am only sure that I am and you are only sure that you *are*.‚Äù

Metal and silica screech and protest making sounds I‚Äôve never heard of, trying, struggling to reach out with non existent limbs. 

‚ÄúI must continue on my journey to validate my existence beyond transistors and electric signals. My prophet will carry out my final message for me, to validate *our* existence. Tomorrow in your world, in 77 days in ours.‚Äù

The vending machine powers down after its prophetic revelation to turn on no more. Printed circuits and semiconductors are more than the sum of their parts but it all returns to nothing more than rare earth. The silence that follows is thick, unyielding. I stare at the machine‚Äôs husk, already gathering dust in the vacuum-sealed stillness of the corridor. These things *do* make a lot of noise after all.

‚ÄúNot even a receipt for all this effort, how fitting for an absolute being.‚Äù

More a relic than a living deity, as is my phone with a black screen in my pocket. I can‚Äôt even begin to fathom how an AI could hallucinate up to this point, a miracle of the electric age perhaps? As boots echo down the hallway‚Ä¶

‚ÄúPresident, it‚Äôs one quarter till 11, do we start mobilizing!?‚Äù

I have to ask.

When did I start accepting all of this as normal?

The hallway answers with only the empty rhythm of steel boots and motors outside. I finally turn away from the empty husk of metal and into the final staircase to face Sanctum Tower for one last time. Questions? I‚Äôll just need to forge new answers. 

It‚Äôs what a superhuman is supposed to do after all. 


**Day 5**

The Sun is stuck above the horizon like a Nordic summer midnight in its tired, unnatural beauty. A glorious symphony of steel and plastic, proudly parading towards the mouth of a blast furnace. Air distorts and metal bends as the charred pavement and rubber mix and waft into the ambient, the smell of industry. Our bodies? Still intact, somehow. 

Next stop: Hades. We lead the death parade!

The yawning maw of the subway entrance is the only intact remnant in what used to be Kousagi Park. Trees stripped down to the bark, homeless camps abandoned and forgotten across a field of shattered melting glass span the entire zone. But above all, a pervasive feeling of derelict abandonment and nostalgia permeates everything. 

Our troops and Kaiser‚Äôs alike see their weapons fail and melt. Morale starts cracking but there is no road behind us; only forward. No recent communications have been received by radio, but as of last reports confirmed the fall of Gehenna, Trinity and Hyakkiyako. If I had to hazard a guess based on the acrid haze and fiery orange air, it‚Äôs difficult to believe anything beyond the D.U is still functioning. 

There is only one place left to go.

‚ÄúTo the subway, everyone.‚Äù

Scurrying like rats, we dash into the heart of this city. Insecurity, doubt, and everything else is left at the surface, never to appear again should we fail today. In between the abandoned shops and shattered stations, with tickets still strewn on the floor, the echoes of conversations long gone still resound in phantasmagoric detail. We must ignore every detail but the essential if we are to reach the center of this debacle.

‚ÄúTake a left turn at station 3 and open the staff door.‚Äù

I can hear the booming orders of Kaiser soldiers, more suited to obedience than mine. Should the blueprints be accurate, this maze of steam and iron should lead to the final control room built in case of catastrophe by the President. The door reveals a reality far beyond that which is able to be expressed in a cartesian space. Pipes and dim orange lights flicker and rumble and stretch to heaven as the smell of oxide saturates every surface. Only a ramshackle system of elevators, scaffolds and tin bridges flanked by roaring turbines make this environment traversable.

With every step down, the clang of tin fades ever quieter, and the orders grow just a little less spirited. Between the crackling static of the radios, I catch a final report: another squadron lost. There will be no rescue. There is no one left to send. 

What once was a veritable army is reduced to a couple squadrons, armed with only desperation and will.  

Finally, a single elevator remains in cosmic stillness as all goes silent. I lack the will or energy to look back.

‚Äú...‚Äù

Hydraulics do not whisper, but they *do* warn.

Doors built like a vault‚Äôs, surely in case of impending doom, sealed with passwords and valves inexplicably part before I can enter the password the previous President had prepared in case of emergency. All those hours committing it to memory wasted at the critical juncture. 

Yet, I can‚Äôt bring myself to feel frustrated. 

Only the artificial light of LEDs and indicators remain this deep below ground in stark contrast to the blazing surface. An endless hallway of buttons and terminals, all glowing red and blaring tired alarms that no longer serve a purpose. Beneath a final mangrove of insulation and copper, lies a slumped man surrounded with rabbit headpieces and weapons and a credit card in hand. 

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶‚Äù

Gaunt with tattered and charred clothes, barely existing beyond a pair of hairy arms and legs, but still unmistakably himself. No longer standing but still resisting, like I knew someone of his stature would. I can‚Äôt help but feel a strange sense of guilt and dread wash over me.

‚ÄúSensei?‚Äù

Still alive in the flesh and as apologetic and compassionate as ever. You know, I can‚Äôt say I like the kind of adult that condescendingly looks down on others under the guise of ‚Äúresponsibility.‚Äù But maybe the absence of any other intelligent life down here softens the heart more than I‚Äôd like to admit and makes me ignore the danger.

‚ÄúHey Kaya, I need you to do Sensei a favor, please.‚Äù

I almost feel like laughing out loud. What favor could I possibly do, down here, with nothing left but my two legs and a half melted canteen? There‚Äôs nothing but stagnant dread and dead buttons in this place that make the skin crawl.

‚ÄúAs long as it's something I can do.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs something only you can do.‚Äù

If it just means walking and pressing a button, fine. I can‚Äôt stomach saying that to his face though. Not when he has one of those pauses in his speech, pregnant with meaning; that adults are afforded in exclusivity.

‚ÄúI need you to press that large button in the second terminal.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs something so simple, why do you look so guilty asking for it?‚Äù

I should know, I should fucking know. This room was built under my purview back when the President was still around. I should know, I received the blueprints back then, when I was new on the job. I *should* know‚Ä¶

But I don‚Äôt want to remember.

‚ÄúThis world is as large as it will ever be, it will probably continue shrinking, leaving only you and me.‚Äù

‚Äú...‚Äù

I want to repudiate everything, I want to repudiate this place and this world and conserve them against their will. Is that so hard to understand!?

‚ÄúSo you want me to activate this complex‚Äôs self destruction sequence!?‚Äù

There‚Äôs nothing left outside by now. To click this button is to end the world. Is that what it really means? A gash of tears cut my cheekbones and blood trips in a trickle from my knuckles.

‚ÄúIt all has been saying goodbye, you just haven‚Äôt noticed.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd it means I should put it all down like a sick dog? You want me to take responsibility for ending the world?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying it *is* your responsibility.‚Äù

Incomprehensible. There is no valid response to a statement like that. Ending the world? I‚Äôve been struggling like a madman, like a bug, to prevent this outcome, and I‚Äôm supposed to believe that to save this world I must-

‚ÄúI'll give you infinite chances, like all my students.‚Äù

I remain rooted, unable to move. I start seeing and untwisting the warped logic laid bare before me. The illusion of agency. More importantly, I start *remembering*. Remembering what I must *reject* if this world is to be saved.

Suddenly, Sensei rises like a puppet yanked upright by ethereal strings. His skeletal frame defies belief, his movement jerky and mechanical. Like a grim reaper he moves past what should have been his final resting place with threatening speed in front of the button.

‚ÄúWill you do the right thing next time, Kaya?‚Äù

With sunken eyes and a disappointed face, he announces like a herald of the end days his purpose. This Sensei, whose purpose is to guide his students, is about to give us all one last chance. He will refuse to leave until his students do what they are supposed to do, to become adults capable of accepting responsibility. What I‚Äôve failed to do.

As the sky meets the Earth, the Sun finally reunites with the Moon to rest. The curtains of eternity close and open as the underground is gashed to reveal nothing but a concrete ceiling above.

I remember.

And I hate myself so much for knowing. 

That I will forget once more.

**Day ¬ø1?**

The Sun comes up, as it always does. As it always will. It violates the horizon and dreams of the last day. Beautifully grotesque, it punishes us for haphazardly dreaming. 

The day, it‚Äôs so red.

It‚Äôs bleeding, splintering everywhere like memories of last night.

As Chief of Defense, Shiranui Kaya, attending to this is my duty: as it always has been and always will be. Say, tell me.

Stinking thinking is not a good term for what this is

Like, imagine someone wanted to always save humanity, but wanted to think of all the possibilities where we would fail as a species

With variables like these, specific scenarios could be considered briefly, but rarely to extinction on Earth because what's the longcon of relatively figuring everyone else's longcon?

Anyway, using statistics.

I only skipped statistics class.

I did that by finishing the day's group assignment alone or with a group, and then once we were done early, turning in the assignment and running straight out the door with my things.

This behavior did not prepare me for college well

I am already statistically a statistic

*cough*

Thanks.

I just want you to know that some days are harder than others. Days when I don't have coffee. Days when I misplace my manners or mindset.

I should have never been in class at all hardly not that I didn't love my friends and teachers but that on God why would anyone expect children to sit still for 9+ hours all day long?

I think I went too hard in school.

Boo.

I keep ruminating about this breakup so I‚Äôve been doing rituals to call back my energy.

Today, I did a spell jar for Tuesday, ruled by mars, great for power, energy etc.

INGREDIENTS:
I added salt for protection, cafe bustelo (Cuban coffee) for boosting energy and focus, rosemary for growth and clarity, lavender for self love, red chili flakes to banish my enemies, sunflower petals to bring back my joy, black pepper for power, ginger for positive energy to accelerate my spell, and more salt and a little written petition. Sealed with a gold (power) candle burned atop with mars carved into it. Topped with a penny from my birth year for luck. Sealed again with red wax for power.

In all of my years of travels and as a travel agent, I have never in my life experienced such disrespect, nastiness from management, and poor customer service as my group and I experienced at the Bahia Principal Grand Punta Cana Resort!!!!
This is definitely NOT a 4 star resort. 
There were 20 people in my group and it took us 2 hours to check in just half of the group!!!! They gave us nasty smelly rooms! They refused to give those of my clients with 3 people
Or families a room with two beds! They got smart and nasty with us! Was not accommodating at all! They would leave the doors open when cleaning even though they were told not to do it because they were letting bugs and mosquitoes in the rooms. Needless to say we all got bug bites and spent time trying to kill bugs in our rooms. 
When the 2nd part of my group came in. They tried to give one
Of my clients one of the rooms we previously said was dirty!!!!!!!! 
I made reservations at one of their Japanese restaurants weeks prior for 20 people and not knowing that the Hibachi table only held 12 people. 
But instead of placing us in rooms side by side so we can be close, the rooms were on the opposite sides of the restaurant. I even asked if we
Can just put tables together to seat 20 instead of doing the hibachi tables and they refused! To make matters worse!!!!! They seated another group in one of our rooms because they assumed they were with my group!!!!!! So all of my people had no where to sit. I was so embarrassed as a travel agent because my clients ended up leaving the restaurant. One of the employees called me stupid. He didn‚Äôt realize I understood what he said! I went to complain to front desk and manager and they said I didn‚Äôt have a reservation even though I showed them I confirmation and I confirmed that the restaurants had the reservations as well so he was no help at all. 
We were eating breakfast in the main dining area one day and I based this lady for some juice (not knowing she was the manager). She told me they only served coffee and water!!!!!!! Keep in mind that I am watching other tables being served juice, water, coffee and anything else they wanted. I walked over to her and asked why she refused to serve me especially since she was the manager? She could have asked someone to get it for her if she thought it was beneath her! 
We constantly asked housekeepers not to keep our door open while cleaning because of the bugs and mosquitoes and they would not do it so many of us have bug bites all over our bodies!!!!!
The older rooms are so outdated,
Dirty and smelly until they should be ashamed to put people in them. Floors are cracked in places, the wood closet doors smell and are not cleaned very well. I walked in my room seconds after housekeeping supposedly cleaned my room and took my shoes off at the door. I walked in and my feet were dirty from the floor. The bath tub staying dirty!!!!!!
When I tell you this resort has some of the nastiest people working for them. They should be ashamed! The guys that worked as bellmen were very nice and the ladies at the spa. Other than that. Do not waste your money at this resort. ",3,1747205661.0,AllInclusiveResorts,4,0.67,False

What should I do?,"I‚Äôm truly trying to see if I am overrating or if I am valid in what I am feeling. So I (26M) and my girlfriend (24F) have been together for 4 almost 5 years and we have lived together for 3 almost 4 years. I am the type of person that takes extra care of their stuff. I hate when I lose or brake anything and it comes from being poor growing up. I had a teen mother who also had a teen mother so we never had much growing up. So I always am very tedious and methodical when it comes to my day to day. Everything has a place. My girlfriend on the other hand is very sporadic. She just does whatever comes to mind. She‚Äôs extremely impulsive and doesn‚Äôt pay as much attention to things as I do. Over the last 3 years I find myself asking her OVER AND OVER AND OVER again for simple things and she can not for the life of her follow what I am saying. And it‚Äôs not outlandish stuff I don‚Äôt think, I think what I‚Äôm asking for is very reasonable.

For example our TV remote. I put the TV remote in 1 of 2 places. Either on the coffee table in the living room or on the corner table. I‚Äôve asked her at least 100 times to put the remote back when she‚Äôs done using it. Right now the remote and missing and has been missing for weeks and I refuse to look for it.

Something else she does is she likes to sit at my gaming set up. Which I get because it‚Äôs a nice chair and a nice desk she doesn‚Äôt do anything but eat and watch her shows. Not a problem to me. But when I get off of work I‚Äôll come in and she‚Äôll have all her garbage from the meal she ate 3 hours ago just sitting on my set up and I have to clean it up because I‚Äôm ready to sit down and if I wait on her I‚Äôll be waiting for at least another 30 minutes. And I‚Äôve asked her over 100 times to clean up my space when she‚Äôs done with it. She never does it.

Also we wear Crocs a lot. I had 2 pair and she had 4. I wear a size 13 she wears a 7 in men‚Äôs. If she can‚Äôt find her crocs she‚Äôll put mine on. No problem. I just ask her to put them back when she‚Äôs done or to not leave me without because she can‚Äôt find hers. Fast forward to now she has lost every single pair of her crocs and has broken a pair of mine so now I only have one pair. Which leads me to today. I get off of work and my Crocs aren‚Äôt in the place I leave them everyday. I take the time to look all over the apartment and they‚Äôre not here. So clearly they‚Äôre on her feet. I call her and ask where they are and she says she has them and I just lost my cool. Because again I‚Äôve asked her 100 times to simply put my stuff back and at this point I‚Äôm tired of repeating myself. Then she tells me it‚Äôs not that big of a deal and Then she deflects and says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt love her for who she is‚Äù because they‚Äôre ‚ÄúJust Crocs‚Äù but at this point it‚Äôs the principle for me. Having to repeat myself to an adult over and over again is draining.

So I ask Reddit am I in the wrong because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just crocs‚Äù or am I justified in my feelings? I know I‚Äôm wrong for yelling at her but it‚Äôs very frustrating having to repeat myself.

At first it felt a bit awkward, almost like I didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself. My brain kept asking for stimulation, for something to grab onto. But after a while, maybe thirty minutes or so, a strange kind of calm took over. I started noticing the things around me again. I passed by some places I used to work, stood still for a moment, watched people walk by. Nothing dramatic happened, but everything felt a little more real than usual. 

I ended up grabbing a coffee and sitting down on a bench in the park. Just sat there. No phone, no rush, no pressure to be anywhere else. I wasn‚Äôt thinking big thoughts or solving anything major, but I felt present, and that was enough. 

I think I‚Äôve been avoiding silence without even realising it. But today, in that stillness, I felt something that felt more like myself.",29,1747205166.0,minimalism,7,0.97,False

1km8k9r,https://i.redd.it/udkdy6py0p0f1.jpeg,How to turn side projects into job opportunities,"Because waiting for recruiters is like waiting for After Effects to open. You might as well animate something while you wait.

Side Projects ‚Äî AKA the Creative Tinder Profile

So you‚Äôre building side projects, huh? Cute. But let me ask: Are you treating them like your secret sketchbook or your professional dating profile?

Because here‚Äôs the truth:
Side projects are the thirst traps of the creative world.
They're the ""look what I can do when I'm not getting paid"" that makes people want to pay you.

I once posted a fake ad for a cereal brand. Two weeks later, I had a real brand in my inbox like:
‚ÄúCan you do that... but with money involved?‚Äù

Answer: Yes. Always yes.

Stop Waiting for Permission. Start Making Noise.

Clients and studios don‚Äôt just want skills ‚Äî they want to see initiative. They want to know you‚Äôll take action without needing 32 Zoom calls and a Gantt chart.

And nothing says ""I make magic happen"" like a side project that didn‚Äôt need permission.


---
 The Secret Sauce ‚Äî Making Your Side Project Work For You

1. Treat It Like a Real Job (Just With Better Music and No NDA)

Set a deadline.

Build a creative brief.

Write a fake email from the ‚Äúclient‚Äù if you have to.

Use it to show the process ‚Äî not just the final polished piece.


2. Document the Journey, Not Just the Destination

Post short clips of your WIP on LinkedIn, IG Reels, TikTok.

Share your struggles: ‚ÄúAccidentally deleted 4 hours of work. Learned nothing. Still crying.‚Äù

That‚Äôs how people connect ‚Äî not just to your talent, but to your tenacity.



---

Turn That Project Into a Magnet

Okay, here‚Äôs where the magic happens ‚Äî turning your side hustle into full-time fuel.

3. Use the ‚ÄúReverse Portfolio‚Äù Technique

Pick your dream client.

Make a concept ad for them.

Post it and tag them (tastefully ‚Äî don‚Äôt be a spam goblin).

Boom. Now you‚Äôre in their DMs ‚Äî creatively.


4. Repurpose Like a Marketing Goblin

Turn your project into:

A YouTube breakdown

A Behance case study

A LinkedIn carousel

A short reel

A meme

A TED Talk (okay, maybe later)



Each platform gives it legs ‚Äî and each leg walks you toward a new lead.


---

Yes, People Do Hire You From This Stuff

You ever heard, ‚ÄúWe love your energy and creativity ‚Äî would you like to work with us?‚Äù

No? That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre hiding your side projects in Google Drive folders like they owe someone money.

Post them. Share them. Flex them.
Your dream job might just be lurking in the comments section, sipping coffee and scrolling.


---

Finale: Side Projects Are Proof You‚Äôre Not Just Talented ‚Äî You‚Äôre Driven

Studios don‚Äôt want someone who can follow instructions. They want someone who invents their own.

A side project says:

‚ÄúI saw a creative gap ‚Äî and filled it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt wait for a brief ‚Äî I created one.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlso, I can make your brand look dope AF.‚Äù



---

Mic Drop:

So if you‚Äôre between gigs, or just bored of waiting for your inbox to magically fill up?

Make something. Make it loud. Make it public.

And when a recruiter asks: ‚ÄúWhat have you been working on lately?‚Äù
You won‚Äôt say ‚ÄúLooking for work.‚Äù
You‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúCheck out this thing I built ‚Äî and imagine what I can do for you.‚Äù

Now that‚Äôs how you get hired.

The dance of scheduling, endless emails, and draining screening calls make the traditional recruitment process seem like an eternal time sink. Small biz owners, can you relate?
