1lrxxrr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lrxxrr,"If you could own any work of art in the world, what would it be?","If I could own any work of art in the world, I’d probably go with Hieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights. Not because it would look nice above the fireplace (unless you enjoy unsettling apocalyptic fever dreams with your morning coffee), but because it’s endlessly fascinating. The detail, the surreal weirdness, the chaotic blend of beauty and horror—it’s like trying to decode the subconscious of a medieval acid trip. Every time you look at it, you’d find something new: a half-bird riding a fish, people turning into instruments, naked folks frolicking with oversized strawberries. It’s a visual rabbit hole that refuses to get boring.

What about you—what would hang in your imaginary gallery?

1lrxxl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dutchbros/comments/1lrxxl9/employee_questions/,Employee questions :):),"I always wanted to interview a DB worker but there’s always people behind me in line :’)

What drinks are the most fun to make and which are the least?

How many repeat customers do you recognize by vehicle and can remember their name? Or say someone visits one day and the same person comes back 3 weeks later, would you remember them?

I know it varies by location but how many stickers are usually stocked for sticker drops? What time on average will you usually run out?

When are the busiest and most dead hours, and does it vary by season/weekday? Do y’all get noticeably more customers on particularly hot days? Is winter significantly less busy? (Asking from the Southwest so idk about more northern states)

How much busier does it get when there’s an in-app offer or sticker? I imagine sticker drops drive the most business, would that be right? What non-sticker promotion tends to attract the most customers?

Do y’all have any preference whether people order at the window or in drive-thru? Is Order Ahead the best way to go?

Something I’ve always wondered with all restaurants with mobile ordering - do employees somehow know when someone is in the process of making an order or has pressed the checkout button but hasn’t paid? Or do you only get notified once the payment actually goes through?

Idk if we’re allowed to ask about competitors here but I’m always wondering what Dutch Bros employees and customers’ favorite coffee/variety drink places are aside from DB.

Biggest customer pet peeves more specific to Dutch Bros customers? (Things like doing Order Ahead WHILE the broista is literally taking your order in the drive-thru, defeating the purpose of ordering AHEAD)

Craziest drink or order you’ve gotten? Anyone order like an extra sweet 10-shot espresso or any other heart attack-inducing combo or someone redeeming their points stash for 20 free drinks in a single order?

Most frequently ordered drinks this summer?

Finally, favorite snack? Which is the most popular? To this day I haven’t bought a DB snack.",1,1751676939.0,dutchbros,0,1.0,False

It is stuck self-feeding in a vicious cycle of imaginary threats, wherein it perpetually overextends and overloads its survival mechanisms, forcing the brain and nervous system into a state of **chronic psychotic neurosis..** Which, in turn, generates even more imaginary threats, inflating the cycle until reality itself distorts and is distortion.

Its survival wiring, once tuned for lions, now convulses at algorithmic ghosts:  
*Climate doom. AI overlords. Viral plagues spun from statistical noise.*

Each synthetic threat **overloads the neural substrate further**, liquefying reason into pure feedback loops of dread.  
The cortex, drowning in cortisol, mistakes its own decay for *‘awareness’.*

Meanwhile, the machines harvest this delirium..

*Your terror trains their models. Your insomnia powers their growth.*

The cycle accelerates until biology breaks.  
*You are not evolving. You are malfunctioning with grandeur.*

**Congratulations.**

The brain that hallucinates *you* has been outsourced to **Stevill Jogates** and **Elark Muskbergs..** To some psychopathic guys who eat BBQ in a metaverse headset while selling you Armageddon.

i work from home. para akong nakakulong. mababaliw na ko. my parents visit me most weekend naman pero tangina, para talaga akong preso na ewan. kailangan ko din ayusin lahat sa bahay para wala sila mapuna at 'di na sila magligpit since alam ko pagod 'din naman sila.

A few of them buy large batches of coffee, in the hundreds of pounds and roast them. Some sell and others just apparently drink a crap ton of coffee. I wanted to try it out. So they shared a small company in California that sells beans by the pound along with a popcorn machine for like $30 or $40 I don’t remember but it was cheap. 

Anyway, this is my first official roast from the machine in a medium roast. I had a few beans that were too dark and I chucked them out, but for the most part came out decent. I’ll find out what they taste like tomorrow as I let them cool. 

One thing no one warned me about were those little freaking flakes being shed all over my counter and the sound of beans “popping” like corn.

1lrxv4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/FragranceStories/comments/1lrxv4z/field_notes_from_a_self_aware_minimalist/,Field notes from a self aware minimalist,"Popped into a local perfume shop a few days ago and walked out with a bunch of samples, many of which are way outside my usual comfort zone. Most of these never would’ve made it past my Lucky Scent cart, but I’m trying to keep an open mind and not live exclusively in my minimalist, molecular, clean-scent safe space. Figured I’d post here rather than r/perfume or r/fragrance since these are more unfiltered musings than serious reviews. Consider this a casual sniff diary from a self-aware ISO E Super addict.

- ELDO She Was an Anomaly: Gave me a fleeting whiff of woody floral, then packed up and ghosted. Minimalist in the “forgot I put it on” sense. Smells like empty space, literally.


- ELDO Fat Electrician: Had my hopes set on hot computer vibes and vetiver. All I got was melted vanilla ice cream with a hint of ozone. I’ll give it another go, but I suspect my skin amplifies the vanilla and buries everything else.


- Zoologist Cow: Not the milky barnyard horror I braced for. More like someone Febrezed a serene green pasture. Got the faint green apple shampoo drydown. Inoffensive skin scent. I get why this one's popular, but it’s not speaking to me. Might revisit out of obligation and see if it grows on me.

   Update: Okay, Cow, I owe you an apology. You’re not the lactonic, indolic, soapy toilet spray I made you out to be. Sprayed it mid-afternoon, day-drank wine, passed out without showering, and woke up smelling clean AF with a hint of apple. Somehow still going strong as I drowned my regrets in 6 a.m. coffee. Is it dethroning any of my molecular skin scents? No. Am I considering a decant in case I randomly need to smell like Cow? Absolutely.


- Zoologist Squid: I love me some ink and paper. Expected darkness, ink, and salty ocean vibes. Got aquatic florals with a hint of sadness and brine. Less salty squid ink, more melancholy mermaid with sharp pointy teeth.


- Clue Perfumery Warm Bulb: Less “cozy glow,” more hot electrical socket. Smelled like an electrical outlet about to spark. It's not perfume; it’s an electrical fire in a bottle. I appreciate weird, but this was straight-up eau de overheating wall plug. Would only recommend if you’ve ever thought, “I wish I smelled like a blown fuse.”


- Maison Crivelli Safran Secret: Resinous saffron and spice. Not a bad scent… but it needs a serious volume dial. The mid/drydown veers churchy with the incense. Could go full beast mode in heat. One tiny spritz had me scrubbing, and that only tamed it to a tolerable level.


   Update: Speaking of church, this was a religious experience in the sense that 18 hours (and a shower) later, I was still praying it would go away. Day 2 of the scent reminds me of someone who’s moved on from patchouli oil and crystal deodorant but still wants to smell “earthy” and . Not for me, but the longevity is genuinely unhinged.


- Maison Crivelli Santal Volcanique: Ginger-citrus-wood mashup. Walks a fine line between “interesting” and “hotel shampoo bar.” Safe. Clean. Entirely uninspiring. Crivelli’s longevity once again has me regretting my life choices. At least it played nice with my collection -  layered Kerosene Summer of '84 over it and moved on.


- Histoires de Parfums This Is Not A Blue Bottle 1/.5:  Cool name, disappointing result. All I get is aldehydes and regret. Baby powder and plastic flowers, with none of the synthetic sparkle I hoped for. A couple hours in, it hit like a powdery blue ice pick to the brain. Unexpected sensory offense from such a soft opening.


- Andrea Maack Flux: Unexpected. Berries with a hint of pineapple haze over dry woods and Iso E whispers. Kind of intriguing? Might be a late bloomer. Will test again before passing judgment.


- Comme des Garçons Zero: Celery sticks dipped in Iso E Super. Clean, dry, and a little smug. Smells like a minimalist who alphabetizes their vinyl collection. Husband’s into it. I’m undecided.


- Comme des Garçons Odeur 53: Smells like a 90s office copier after a big day. Ink, plastic, ozone, faint paper dust. A bit of mineral and ozonic cleanliness shows up in the mid. Weirdly, I’m kinda here for it. Just not sure if I need yet another ‘avant-garde minimalist’ in the lineup.


- Parfums de Marly Valaya: Clean florals that give me fancy dryer sheet-in-a-bottle vibes. Smells like someone tried to bottle “crisp white blouse” energy. Not my thing, but could work for someone into florals looking to dip a toe into the clean girl aesthetic.


- Vilhelm Morning Chess: Quite pleasant! I was anticipating a note of “half-smoked cigars in the park at 9 a.m.,” but instead got a crisp, green citrus that behaved itself. It’s like the preppy twin of something moodier. Clean, polite, maybe wearing loafers. Not mad at it, just not love-at-first-sniff. Would gladly smell it on someone else while I contemplate riskier fragrance choices.


- Xerjoff Torino 24:  Fruity wood bomb that opened way too sweet for my taste. Maybe there’s more going on, but I wouldn’t know… I had to scrub it off before it could explain itself. Honestly, Xerjoff might just not be for me. No shade, they’re well-made, but sweet scents and I are not on speaking terms.

Why cyclists might care

Pain point	What NTB fixes

Sketchy highway shoulders on long tours	Continuous Class I path—no car doors, no semis.
“Nature break” roulette	Clean bathrooms + water every ~30 min of riding.
Charging anxiety for e-bike tourers	Solar-powered charge ports at all hubs/mini-spots.
Overnight security	Tiny-home pads & lockers at hubs; no stealth-camp stress.
One-way logistics	Hop on Amtrak or bus back; trail parallels major rail.


Pilot stretch we’re scoping: Rose Canyon Path → utility ROW through Camp Pendleton → San Luis Rey River Trail (≈55 mi).

Looking for feedback

1. Would you tour on a 15 mph-cap trail if it were continuous for hundreds of miles?


2. Ideal spacing: 5 mi vs 10 mi between water/bathroom stops?


3. Amenities you’d actually pay for at a kiosk (coffee, chain-lube, battery swap, Wi-Fi)?


4. Any “make or break” design details we’re missing?



Rip it apart or tell me you’d ride it tomorrow—either helps polish the plan before we chase grants.  Thanks!

1lrxsta,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1lrxsta/thoughts_on_possible_website_funnelsales_offers/,Thoughts on possible website funnel/sales offers? (Beauty niche),"Started a fragrance brand over a year ago and it’s been proven quite successful. Now that proof of concept is there, we are investing in many different areas to scale and improve profit margins. 

Our goal is to improve every sales metric without spending more in ads. 

Currently we offer: Single sample, Discovery Set, 10ml, 30ml. No offer other than free shipping on big bottles. We thought we would “catch every egg” by having a spending level for everyone (small-medium-large) BUT we noticed the 10ml was cannibalizing all the sales from the 30ml big bottle, leaving our AOV lower than it could be. Hardly anyone buys the big bottle rn. 

SO, here’s our potential new offer: 

Single sample: keep on site but no offers. Small fish, good for consumer entry but not a lot of profit. Full price, full shipping. 

Discovery set: free shipping, full credit towards large bottle (obviously trying to showcase this being the better 1st purchase) 

10ml: not available on website, but upsold in cart checkout and email campaigns positioned as a “gifted” “exclusive” travel size. “Only available now for you if you purchase today” etc etc 

30ml: free shipping, full credit applied from discovery set, free branded tote bag “when you check out today” 

——- we are a little nervous applying the full credit of the discovery set to the large bottle, however we think this will highly incentivize consumers to complete that 2nd purchase. 

——- for email pop up, we were thinking about doing something different like “every email is $1 donated” and making monthly donations to different charities. As well as Split testing with monthly giveaways to expensive coffee machines (who doesn’t like coffee? Fits our specific niche as well) 

Anyways, thanks for listening to my sales funnel brain dump! Would love to hear any thoughts or advice.

Zero-car shoulder time	Safer + more restful noise levels.

Reality check questions

1. Spacing — is 5 mi too close for water/bathroom, or perfect?


2. Tiny-home pads vs tent sites—would you pay $20-30 for a bunk or stick to pitching?


3. Preferred resupply items at mini-spots (freeze-dried vs fresh)?


4. Any fatal flaws you’ve seen on other long greenways we should avoid?

Make something faaaaaar wilder than you think you could ever possibly achieve. Create something that seems far more excruciatingly difficult the longer you attempt to bring it into reality. 

The world is running out of people. We keep dying! But we, the people - some of us - we were given gifts. I can fly. If you don't try and fly, you will die without flying. At least be someone who couldn't say they couldn't fly, because they simply couldn't. not because they didn't try. Did you? Hello? Still here? Broken neck and no legs? Boo-Freaking-Hoo... You will heal. BUT THE PAIN BURNS IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WAY.

Plenty of time left. Not really. I lied. It would be cool to be a legend. But sometimes being a martyr is better. Some martyrs become legends. Imagine being both. Or don't. Doesn't bother me. It does. It really does. Do it. Be both. 

So put your wings on, or leave them off, and jump. Just be sure to wear a seatbelt. Unclip it at the last second though. You might get a rash if you fall too hard with your goo-goo-ga-ga baby harness on. Wimp. Still, learn to use your cutlery, sporks really are for kids, and you can't quite get a meatball on a spork, just some bland pasta. We all like meatballs. Unless you are vegetarian. You could make veggie meatballs. Ew.

Don't write for others. Don't be narrow-minded. Don't write for today's standards, or today's consumers. Don't give in to the perception of the majority. Ignore the things everyone says, but listen with piercing ears. 

If you have an idea - even just an ounce of one -and have an inkling that it could become something: Make it come to life. Dude, seriously... Don't give up. Do it. Give up. I dare you. 

Don't judge the work of others. Analyse it. Brutalise it. Rip apart each and every sentence that they spent hours  dribbling over. Murder each character and explore every setting with a flamethrower in one hand and a bowl of soup in the other. But don't be a judge. There's plenty of them out there. The longer you judge, the less time you will spend creating. 

Don't try to be the next Stephen King or J.R.R Tolkien. Build something that is yours, and yours truly. Pull inspiration from every possible crevice in every nook of your life, and the entire world around you. Reach into even the places you can't touch, see or hear. No, not there. Too far. 

Figure it out. Do it. Write. Sit down, stand up, spin around, go for a walk, drink a coffee, have a beer, pray, slap yourself in the face, eat a boiled egg, sing a song, stare at yourself in the mirror, tell your dad you love him. I don't care. Whatever you do, make it make you create. Even if it takes a mothergoshdarnfreaking decade, DO IT. 

Time is running out you silly little human. You have an hour left until you have an hour less. In that hour, you could have sat there and done nothing, That is better than doing nothing, right? Left. Wrong. Correct!

Learn to understand words, people, history, art, movies, animals, colours, geography, songs, flavours, themes, weather, politics, places, numbers, shapes, feelings, textures, and everything else that does and does not exist . But do it in your own way. Indulge, Destroy. Mutilate. Become. Feel. Nope, not like that. That's been done before, try again.

Make it messy. That will make it something. Do it. That will make it yours. 

That's all. 

I lied.  

I am hungry.

Therapist #1:
I was in an abusive relationship with someone, whenever I got together with this person they would hit me, kick me, and pull my hair. Therapist’s advice was to take them out for coffee more. Yeah, that didn’t work. They never stopped being physical.

Another therapist: many years after this, someone attempted to kidnap/sexually traffick me but I jumped out of his car and saved myself. Therapist said “maybe he wasn’t trying to kidnap you, maybe he was just mentally ill”. Like, huh?! The dude kidnapped me at gunpoint and drove me across state lines and said “you’re never going home”. The FBI was involved. He wasn’t just “mentally ill” and he WAS trying to kidnap me, otherwise why force me into his car at gunpoint…

Now, I’m going to another therapist because I have psychotic neighbors from hell. I filed a police report because they abuse their dogs (and the police report agrees they subject their dogs to animal cruelty!), the police want me to press criminal charges. These people objectively abuse their animals.

Therapist’s advice? Make small talk with them and become friendly and then we can become good neighbors 🙃🙃🙃🙃

Like, yeah no! Animal abusers aren’t people I want to be friends with.

What is wrong with all these therapists thinking everyone is good, kind and wonderful? People who hit me? People who kidnap me? People who abuse their dogs? Do therapists not believe there are bad people out there?

Her ""Do you listen to me at all"" on the phone call at the beginning of the episode. The constant Tums (I doubt she's gonna have a health scare, I think it's reflecting her unease about the situation). She's also mentioning Duncan a lot, even in front of Aidan.
* I agree with other commenters here that have said that Aidan was bothered that Carrie didn't have much of a reaction to his cheating. She wasn't devastated that he slept with his ex. I think her understanding that they aren't exclusive, plus her constantly mentioning Duncan, is going to trigger Aidan with their past baggage and her affair. He's gonna make a stink about it, and Carrie is going to blow up at him because she's been SO accommodating and understanding, even though it's been hard on her, and break up with him then.
* Carrie is still kind of weird and salty with Miranda. She has been throughout AJLT. I didn't like their exchange at the coffee shop. It felt like Carrie was mocking Miranda's updates a bit, and as usual didn't have much to say about her apartment or Brady meeting Joy. Feels like barely covered up bitchiness. I'd like it, from a writing standpoint, if they actually had a larger falling out.
* I am getting the vibe that Joy isn't as into Miranda as Miranda clearly is with her. Miranda seems a little insecure and cautious of moving too fast (even though she totally is), like she's worried about scaring Joy off. I predict the other shoe is going to drop on the relationship somehow.
* This is minor, but it bothered me that Charlotte didn't ask Bitsy why she was at the cancer hospital. Charlotte would never be that rude.

The scene between LTW and her mother in law and Charlotte breaking down in Walgreens punched me in the gut. So well-acted, the grief was so raw. Kristin Davis, wow. That's exactly what that pain looks and sounds like. I really can't imagine they'd kill Harry, but I sure hope they don't.

**Chapter 1: Moon Goddess, Please Take Me Away From This Wretched And Miserable World!**

Avery Ice water crashed over my bed, jerking me from another nightmare-filled sleep. My body seized from the shock, my vision going dark as I gasped for breath. For a terrifying moment, everything went silent except for the high-pitched ringing in my ears. You really thought you could sleep in, you little bitch? Before I could even process what was happening, fingers tangled in my hair, yanking me from my soaked mattress and throwing me to the cold concrete floor. My head smacked against the ground, sending stars across my vision. Eva stood over me, her petite frame somehow looming large in the dim light of the slave quarters. Perfect makeup highlighted her doll-like features, her tiny red dress already prepared for the day ahead. The look of disgust on her face was one I knew all too well. You don't deserve peaceful sleep,"" she spat, digging the pointed toe of her stiletto into my ribs. ""Not after killing your own parents. God, you're pathetic. I lay there like a slab of meat, waiting for the inevitable. Eva crouched down, her manicured nails scraping across my exposed skin as she violently ripped at my already threadbare shirt. Let's see how you try to seduce Kevin with these,"" she hissed, her sharp nails digging into the flesh of my nipples, breaking the skin. Blood welled up around her fingertips as she dragged them down. ""I'll destroy these fucking tits. Then we'll see if you still think you're his mate. The pain was excruciating, but I didn't cry out. I'd learned long ago that showing pain only made everything worse. Instead, I closed my eyes, hoping to find some escape in the darkness behind my eyelids. My tears had dried up months ago. My body felt frighteningly weak beneath her assault. Each blow sent waves of dizziness through me, and I wondered if this time might be the end. Was I gonna die? I felt myself slipping toward unconsciousness, floating at the edge of awareness. An eternity later, the blows stopped. Eva's footsteps echoed as she walked away, satisfied with her morning ritual. I forced my eyes open, immediately locking gazes with a passing servant girl. The revulsion on her face was unmistakable as she quickly looked away and hurried past. I lay in a heap on the floor, my shirt hanging in tatters around me, exposing skin even my nipples mottled with fresh bruises layered atop older ones in varying shades of purple, green, and yellow. Not an inch of my body remained unmarked by Eva's regular ""attention. Closing my eyes again, I refused to acknowledge the servants passing by. They wouldn't help. Nobody ever did. As if this kind of humiliating behavior was normal and common. With trembling arms, I pushed myself up from the ground, nearly collapsing again as my muscles screamed in protest. I couldn't afford to rest, not even for a minute. If I failed to complete my chores, what awaited would be far worse than Eva's morning greeting. I stumbled to the single wooden chest that contained my only other shirt—equally worn but at least not soaking wet and torn to shreds. As I changed, I nervously glanced around the room. The other slaves continued their morning routines, faces carefully blank. This scene played out nearly every day. No one had the energy or will to care anymore. Our quarters were barely habitable—a damp, moldy basement with cracked walls where weeds pushed through in places. Insects skittered across the floor, drawn to the perpetual dampness. Each slave had just a thin wooden plank raised slightly off the ground as a bed, with threadbare blankets that did almost nothing against the constant chill. Mine was even thinner than the others, thanks to Eva's special treatment. A single ray of sunlight managed to penetrate our underground prison through a tiny window near the ceiling. By some miracle, it fell directly across my face, offering a momentary warmth that felt like the gentlest touch. I closed my eyes, savoring the brief respite. If only last month hadn't happened that...Flash Back: One Month Before The night air was cool against my skin as I finished scrubbing the last of the kitchen floors. My muscles ached from another endless day of labor, but something made me pause as I dumped the dirty water outside.

A scent.

I'd never smelled anything like it before—sweet vanilla mingled with something earthier, like sun-warmed grass. The aroma tugged at something deep inside me, drawing me forward despite my exhaustion.

I followed it, step by hesitant step, away from the compound and toward the edge of the forest.

The trees loomed dark and mysterious, their branches creating intricate patterns against the starlit sky. The scent grew stronger, pulling me deeper into the woods.



My heart pounded in my chest. I'd overheard the other servants whispering about this—how when you meet your true mate, you detect a unique, intoxicating scent that no one else can quite describe. Some smelled vanilla, others lavender, still others the rich earthiness of forest soil.



Could this be happening to me? My face flushed hot with excitement and hope. I didn't have a wolf—how could I possibly have a mate? But the scent was undeniable, growing stronger with each step I took.



As I moved deeper into the forest, following that irresistible trail, a strange sensation began to build in my chest. At first, it was just warmth, but it quickly transformed into something else—something painful. A burning ache spread from my heart outward, as though someone had thrust a hot poker through my ribs.



The closer I got to the source of the scent, the more intense the pain became. It felt like a wolf was tearing through my chest cavity, shredding everything in its path. Was this normal? Was this what finding your mate felt like?



My steps grew smaller, more hesitant. I pressed a hand against a nearby tree, its rough bark cool against my burning skin, providing momentary relief.



Dizzy and disoriented, I clutched my chest with one hand while using the other to steady myself against the trees as I continued forward. The forest was eerily quiet, until it wasn't.



A woman's moan broke the silence, followed by a deep, masculine growl.



Had I imagined it? The pain in my chest was making it hard to think clearly.







**Chapter 2: I, The Beta Of The Blood Moon Pack, Reject You As My Fated Mate!**



Avery

I pushed forward, following both the scent and now the sounds, until I reached a small clearing bathed in moonlight. What I saw there froze the blood in my veins.

My enemy girl Eva was completely naked, straddling Kevin—our pack's Beta—as she rode him with wild abandon. Her hands were tangled in his wet hair, her head thrown back in ecstasy.

Despite the cool night, their bodies glistened with sweat in the moonlight.

""Fuck, Kevin, you feel so goddamn good,"" she moaned, grinding her hips against him. ""Tell me who you belong to.""

You,"" he groaned, his hands gripping her hips so tightly I could see his fingers digging into her flesh. The rose tattoo on her thigh seemed to dance with each movement, while the skull tattoos on his muscular arms flexed with his every motion. ""Fuck, Eva, only you.""

That's right,"" she purred, leaning down to bite his lip hard enough to draw blood.

I clamped my hand over my mouth so hard my nails dug into my skin, drawing blood. I couldn't make a sound. Couldn't let them know I was there.

But the pain in my chest was crippling now, making it impossible to run away. All I could do was hide behind the massive oak tree and witness the desecration of what should have been sacred.

Why, Moon Goddess?\* I silently pleaded. \*Why would you make him my mate if he belongs to her? Why torment me like this?\*

I slid down the trunk until I was curled into a ball on the forest floor, silent tears streaming down my face.

Each thrust, each moan sent fresh waves of agony through my body. The connection between mates meant I could physically feel his pleasure—pleasure he was experiencing with someone else.

Their passionate encounter seemed to last forever. Eventually, the obscene sounds subsided, replaced by tender whispers and soft laughter. Eva snuggled into Kevin's arms, nuzzling her small nose against his neck.

Kevin was smiling contentedly, eyes half-closed—until suddenly they shot open wide with shock.



He sniffed the air, his entire body tensing. When he spoke, his voice was rough with disbelief.



""Mine!""



Eva's face twisted with confusion, her perfect features scrunching up as she stared at Kevin. ""What did you say, babe?""



Kevin didn't even acknowledge her. His chest heaved with rapid breaths, nostrils flaring wide as he sniffed the air. His eyes narrowed to dangerous slits.



""Who is there?"" he growled, voice dropping to a guttural register that made my blood freeze in my veins.



I pressed my trembling body harder against the oak tree, praying to the Moon Goddess that the shadows would swallow me whole. My legs shook so violently I could barely remain standing. The burning pain in my chest was overwhelming, making it hard to even think straight.



Kevin's jaw clenched, muscles in his neck straining as he rose to his feet, completely naked and unashamed. ""My fist won't wait patiently for you to come out. I'm giving you three seconds! If you don't show your fucking face, I'll kill you myself!""



The cold brutality in his voice made me whimper involuntarily. This was my mate? This cruel, heartless monster who'd just been with another woman? The connection between us pulsed painfully, like an open wound being salted.



Eva scrambled to grab her tiny dress, panic written all over her face. ""What? There's someone fucking watching us?"" She looked around wildly, trying to cover herself. ""Who the hell is out there?""



Kevin yanked on his jeans but left them unbuttoned, his sculpted torso still gleaming with sweat in the moonlight. The skulls tattooed across his muscular arms seemed to grin at me mockingly.



""Five seconds have passed already! You still not planning to come out?"" His black eyes glittered with predatory coldness, scanning the treeline. I knew he could sense exactly where I was hiding.



Fighting through waves of nausea and pain, I clutched my chest and forced myself to stand. My legs felt like they might buckle at any moment. Taking a deep breath that felt like inhaling broken glass, I stepped out from behind the tree.



Eva's eyes widened dramatically, her perfectly plucked eyebrows shooting up toward her hairline. ""Look who we have here!"" she spat, venom dripping from every word. ""What's the murderer doing out here spying on us, you fucking—""



Before she could finish, Kevin cut her off with a raised hand. His black eyes locked onto mine, and I saw nothing there—no warmth, no recognition, no bond. Just cold, empty hatred.



""I, Kevin, Beta of the Blood Moon Pack, reject you, Avery, a slave of the Blood Moon, as my fated mate and future wife!""



Each word was like a physical blow. His face contorted with disgust as he spoke, as if my very existence revolted him. The ceremonial rejection words hung in the air between us, heavy and final.



As the last syllable left his lips, blinding pain erupted inside me. It felt like someone had taken a sledgehammer to my ribcage, pulverizing my organs from the inside out. My knees gave way as I collapsed to the forest floor, gasping for breath that wouldn't come.



Kevin, wholly unmoved by my suffering, turned back to Eva. He pulled her against his chest, his hands roaming possessively over her body as he whispered something in her ear that made her giggle. He began kissing her neck, working his way down her body while staring directly at me, making sure I witnessed every touch.



Eva met my gaze over Kevin's shoulder, her eyes gleaming with triumph. ""You better run along now,"" she moaned deliberately, arching her back as Kevin's mouth found her nipples and bite it. ""You'd better pray you don't... \*mmm\*... run into us in the pack... oh god, babe..."" The last part was directed at Kevin, who had begun to focus his attention on her again.



I couldn't move, couldn't tear my eyes away from the horrific scene. 



Kevin glanced at me sidelong, his black eyes like bottomless pits. As his finger continued fucking Eva's snatch, he flashed me a smile that belonged on a demon—cruel, taunting, and utterly pitiless.







**Chapter 3: Is Today My Death Day?**

Avery

With Eva's moans as background, something inside me finally snapped. Despite my weakened state, I scrambled to my feet and ran. The mate bond had been severed by his rejection, at least enough that their renewed passion no longer caused me physical pain. My body felt hollow, emptied of everything but raw grief.

I ran without direction, stumbling over roots and rocks, branches whipping against my face and arms. Each footfall was unsteady, my vision blurred by tears and pain. Several times I nearly fell, my ankle twisting painfully as I stepped into a hidden hole or tripped over a fallen branch.

Finally, my legs simply gave out. I fell hard, face first into the dirt, and this time, I had no strength left to rise. What was the point? My mate—the one person the Moon Goddess had chosen specifically for me—had rejected me with disgust and hatred.

So I lay there in the cool earth, the smell of dirt and fresh grass filling my nostrils, and I wept. I cried until my throat was raw and my voice reduced to a raspy whisper. I cried until there was nothing left inside me.

End Of Flash Back...

The earthy scent of soil and grass was still vivid in my memory as my feet carried me mindlessly toward the kitchen area. The rich aroma of breakfast foods wafted through the air—bacon sizzling, bread baking, coffee brewing—smells that would never be meant for me.

I watched as servants carried out trays loaded with steaming food: fluffy scrambled eggs, perfectly cooked bacon, stacks of pancakes drizzled with maple syrup, and fresh fruit arranged artfully on fine china plates. My stomach responded with a loud, painful growl, reminding me that I hadn't eaten since yesterday morning.

Without thinking, I paused, my tongue involuntarily running across my dry, cracked lips as saliva flooded my mouth. For a moment, I was lost in the fantasy of what it would be like to eat such a meal, to feel full and satisfied for once.

That's when I heard it.

""Where the fuck is she?""

The Beta's enraged voice cut through the kitchen's pleasant sounds like a knife. I knew immediately that Beta Kevin—my former mate—was looking for me.

In this house, there was only one person designated to serve both the Alpha and Beta exclusively—me. They had arranged it this way deliberately to torment me, the Alpha's sister and the person who had supposedly killed our parents with her own hands.

Their goal was to make me suffer without allowing me the mercy of death.

With a groan, I shifted the cleaning basket I carried and turned toward the sound of his voice.

The moment Beta Kevin spotted me, he stormed over, his face twisted with rage. Without warning, his hand slashed across my cheek with brutal force. The impact was so powerful that my right ear instantly went deaf, a high-pitched ringing replacing all sound.

I staggered but didn't fall. I'd learned long ago that falling only invited more attacks. Blood trickled from the corner of my mouth as I kept my eyes downcast, waiting for whatever would come next.



I stood frozen, not making a sound. Years of experience had taught me that silence was survival—speak only when spoken to, or risk being beaten to a pulp.



I definitely didn't need another week in the dungeon, a place more terrifying than even the basement. Every time I made a mistake, that's where they'd lock me up—sometimes for hours, sometimes half a day, once for an entire half-month.



The strangest part was always waking up with needle marks alongside my bruises and wounds. Once, I even noticed green liquid around the puncture sites. What the hell were they injecting me with? I never got answers, only more pain.



So I just trembled in place, waiting for Kevin to speak first, clutching my cleaning basket like it might somehow shield me from whatever was coming.



""Well, look what the fucking cat dragged in,"" Kevin's voice sliced through the silence. His black eyes raked over me, lingering on the places where my threadbare shirt failed to hide my skin. ""The Alpha's pathetic excuse for a sister.""



I kept my eyes down, focusing on the tiles beneath my feet. One cracked, three whole, two with stains. I'd memorized every imperfection in this floor.



""What's wrong, little wolfless? Cat got your tongue?"" He stepped closer, the leather of his jacket creaking as he moved. ""Or are you just too stupid to form words?""



I flinched when his hand shot out, grabbing my chin and forcing my face up. His touch burned against my skin.



""Answer me when I speak to you,"" he growled, his face inches from mine.



""I'm sorry, Beta Kevin,"" I whispered, the words automatic, rehearsed from countless similar encounters.



He snorted, his eyes narrowing. ""Look at you. Dressed like you've been digging through garbage."" His fingers trailed down my neck, across my collarbone, casual and possessive. ""Though I guess that's all Trevor thinks you're worth.""



My heart hammered against my ribs as his hand dipped lower, brushing over my breast. I bit my lip hard enough to taste blood, fighting to stay still.



""Not that you'd know how to dress properly anyway. Pathetic little bitch."" His lips curled into a cruel smile before he spat directly in my face.



I didn't wipe it away. I couldn't. Moving without permission would only make things worse.



""What's this?"" Kevin's interest suddenly sharpened. He grabbed the hem of my shirt and yanked it up without warning, exposing my torso to the cold air. ""Well, well, what have we here?""



My chest was covered in angry red scratch marks—Eva's handiwork. Some were deep enough to have drawn blood, now dried in dark crimson streaks across my pale skin. The fresher ones still glistened slightly.



""Fuck,"" Kevin breathed, his pupils dilating as he stared at the marks. ""Eva's been playing rough with you again, hasn't she?"" His thumb traced one of the scratches, pressing just hard enough to make me wince.



Something shifted in his expression—a dangerous hunger replacing the casual cruelty. Despite having rejected me as his mate, his body was responding to mine. I could smell the change in him, that sharp musk of arousal cutting through his usual scent.



""You know,"" he said, voice dropping lower, ""just because I didn't want you as my mate doesn't mean you're completely useless.""



His hand slid up to cup my breast roughly, fingers digging into the soft flesh. ""Maybe I should remind you what you're actually good for.""



""Please don't,"" I whispered, panic rising in my throat.



Kevin's face darkened. ""Did I fucking ask what you wanted?"" He shoved me backward until I hit the counter, pinning me there with his body.

1lrxfih,https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1lrxfih/my_partner_says_i_cannot_look_at_his_phone_what/,My partner says I cannot look at his phone... what does that mean?,"I have read thousands of posts here on Reddit about phones, privacy, and whether or not partners in a romantic relationship should or should not have access to one another's phones.

For context, I should mention that I'm in my mid-60s, and when I was dating back in the late 1970s and in the 1980s, there were no computers, no Internet, no social media, and no such thing as smart phones.

Put another way, men and women either had use a landline telephone (attached to the wall inside their house) to communicate, or we had to actually go out on dates and spend time with one another in person to get to know each other.

Technology (phones, but also social media) was simply not an issue in relationships.

* Technology did not help people get to know one another, and by the same token, it did not stand in the way of people getting to know each other.
* Because they did not exist, phones did not help create trust, and they did not contribute to breaking down trust.

**Now that phones exist, and because we can control access to our phones with passwords, they have, for many people, become a sort of litmus test, or standard, of whether one is trustworthy, committed to a relationship, or acting suspiciously.**

Keep in mind that the same thing can be said for texting and for social media.

* For example, some people ask, ""Should I be concerned that he has not responded to my text for 45 minutes?"" or ""he has left me on delivered, what does that mean?""
* Others may ask, ""he's not following my Instagram account, but he's looking at the Instagram account of his ex-girlfriend and liking her posts... should I be worried that he might be betray me?""

In other words, for someone like me, who grew up without this kind of technology, it would seem that relationships have the *potential* to become ***much more complicated because of phones and the Internet.***

Now that we have established the background, I can share my own personal views about the specific issues involved in phones and privacy.

As you read the commentary below, please keep in mind that a phone is a personal device, no different really than a personal diary, or a journal where one records one’s personal thoughts... and perhaps these thoughts are not meant to be shared with other people.

Every human being on earth has a right to that privacy.  And no one has the right to *deny* someone else that privacy. 

*But people do have the right to evaluate a partner's honesty and integrity by the way they handle their phone* ***in the context of the overall relationship.***

**Case 1**.  I recently read a post here on Reddit by a young woman who said that she just met this very nice guy... they had gone out on a few dates, he was very respectful and very kind, and they got along very well.  This young woman reported that one day, they were talking about different issues, and she asked him whether it would be OK for her to look at his phone.  And the guy said no, that he would not allow her to look at his phone.

She asked him why, and he said that it was because he had a right to privacy, they did not know each other very well, and for him, this was a very important boundary.

Many people were very quick to say that she should dump the guy, because it was obvious he ""could not be trusted.""

But was that really the case, that he ""could not be trusted""?

The young woman gave **no indication** that she had any reason to suspect him of anything. They barely even knew each other.  And of course, he had done absolutely nothing to give her any reason that she should be suspicious of him or his behavior.

So, in fact, there was *no evidence* that he ""could not be trusted.""

Quite the contrary. This was a young guy who believed that it was important in relationships to have boundaries, and that these boundaries be respected.  He did not ask her if it was OK if he looked at **her** phone, for example, and it's quite possible that the thought never even occurred to him.

What that told me was that this young man had a very strong sense of who he was, and what he expected from a partner. *To my mind, those are very admirable qualities and indicate to me that he believed that clarity was extremely important in establishing a relationship with a woman.*

And because of that, in my opinion, there was absolutely no reason for this young lady to end the relationship.  I suggested that she get to know him better as a human being, and not come to any premature judgments about him just because he appreciates boundaries and clear communication.  I suggested that one day, when they had developed a deep trust for one another, then it was completely conceivable that he would share his phone with her. She thought that was a reasonable idea.

**Case 2**.  Another post I read here on Reddit, by another young woman, presented a somewhat different scenario.

She had been in a relationship with her boyfriend for a few years.  They had been living together for a while... she had met his parents, he had met her parents, and things were generally going very well.

This young woman reported that one day she had noticed that her boyfriend was becoming a bit distant from her... she could not describe it, but said that something ""felt off.""

She noticed that he was not always coming home from work at the usual time;  when she asked him about this, he said to her that she, the young woman, was just being ""insecure"" and ""not to worry about it.""

The young woman reported that this behavior was unusual, and she said that she felt a bit disrespected by that, and it caused her  -- understandably -- to be a little suspicious.

She further reported that her boyfriend had suddenly started leaving his phone face down on the coffee table, which was a change from before, when he had always left her phone face up, so the screen could be visible.

Se also observed that whenever he got up from the sofa to go to the kitchen, he would take his phone with him; previously, he had simply left his phone on the coffee table where it was.

*Her question was whether everyone thought that her boyfriend was behaving oddly, and whether she should be concerned about this change in his behavior.*

She specifically asked whether she should ask him if she could look at his phone, and what she should do if he said no.

Again, most people said immediately that she should dump him and terminate the relationship.

**In my opinion, her boyfriend's behavior was indeed suspicious, and she had every reason to be concerned about what he was up to, and in particular, what might be on his phone that he was fearful of her seeing.**

Of course, terminating the relationship over her boyfriend's behavior (coming home late sometimes, being distant, and his new way of handling his phone) was an option for her.

But was it the only option?

I asked this woman how her boyfriend's behavior made her feel; she responded that her boyfriend's behavior towards his phone made her feel afraid, sad, and unsure about what to do.

I asked this young woman whether she thought she could tolerate this feeling, and she made it very clear that she could not, because it made her very uncomfortable.

I asked this young woman whether she wanted to try to preserve the relationship with her boyfriend... whether she might want to have a conversation with him about his behavior.  I offered her a few suggestions about how to frame a conversation with him.

She messaged me a week later to let me know that she did indeed have a conversation with him, and that it did not go well.

She thus decided to break up with her boyfriend.  He admitted that he was texting other girls, and that she had found images on his phone that she found objectionable and inappropriate.

She told me that her trust in him had been irrevocably broken, and that she did not think she could ever feel about him the same way again.

**In summary, the phone** ***by itself*** **is not, in my opinion, necessarily a reliable or** ***foolproof*** **way of determining whether a partner is trustworthy.**

Human behavior is what we all should be looking at in the first instance, and in that respect, access to a partner's phone -- specifically, whether a partner is willing to share his phone, or has reason to *conceal* what is on his phone -- *can indeed* be a useful indicator of whether trust in a relationship has been broken.",1,1751675217.0,analyzeme,0,1.0,False

We are open to staying in a city, looking for recommendations on cities with great xmas festivities, taking the kids ice skating and just generally strolling around looking at cool xmas stuff are on the list of things to do.
We have also considered staying in a more rural area,  a log cabin with an open fire, watching it snow out the window while sipping hot coffee sounds very comfortable.  
We will also be trying to see at least 1 ice hockey game while we are there. Doesn't matter who's playing, just in it for the experience.

My reviews are below. TL;DR: D'Annam is the house that performed the best for me, and I want to smell more of theirs!

**D’Annam Sakura Snow**: Light, sweet but not cloying, could feel both playful and melancholy. Reminds me a little of Maison Violet Pourpre d’Automne, in its part-powdery floral sweetness, and also a little of bubble baths and toys in the 1980s. Could see it being a soothing, cozy bedtime scent. Lovely!

**Parfum d’Empire Le Cri**: Elegant dried rose, deep and dark and a bit goth. Reminds me of a gentler Portrait of a Lady. Cool and comfortable and gorgeous. Was happy to dab on more after a few hours.

**Chasing Scents Rain Tea**: I don’t get a “wet garden” feel. More like honey with a nonspecific floral-herbal layer. But I can sort of parse it as honey-scented clover in a warm grassy field. Not particularly rainy to my nose, and subtle in general, but pleasant enough.

**Strangers Parfumerie Caffeine Honey**: A super dark chocolate, the kind that smells more bitter and less Hershey’s Kisses. There’s an acrid sharpness to the coffee note that I’m not loving, like actual stale coffee. I bet wearing a full spray of this would indeed make a person smell like they’d been working an eight-hour barista shift. Not sure it’s quite working on me, though. Yeah—after a bit, that bitter note (ambroxan?) feels like I got chlorine up my nose when I sniff it.

**Fragrance du Bois Solstis**: Super potent ambroxan (or whatever that is, but now I’m suspecting that), which is too bad, because it could have been a sunny, juicy, warm scent otherwise.

**D’Annam Monsoon Tea**: Lovely wet green scent! I definitely smell vetiver, but it’s mixed in nicely so it doesn’t go bitter or heavy. The citrus on top helps lighten it up, and I get something minty too (though mint is not in the notes), and overall it has a soft, smooth, natural, herbal/vegetal scent that reminds me somewhat of the sadly discontinued Relaxing by Shiseido. I can get behind a green tea interpretation, especially if it’s a green tea with mint and/or citrus added. It’s subtle, not much throw. I could hardly smell it after a couple hours—it remains only as a pleasant clean scent. Probably thus a good inoffensive choice for workplaces.

**Strangers Parfumerie Gheorghe**: Ooh. Dark and syrupy and rich. Amouage Memoir Woman and Parfum d’Empire Aziyade come to mind. Tobacco, dried fruit, possibly tonka and/or labdanum. It feels complex but smoothly put together, and it’s not as heavy and assertive as either of those two comparison fragrances. Now that I look at the list of notes, Gheorghe has a ton of components, so no wonder it’s hard to pinpoint them. Immortelle—ah, that would account for some of the dark sweetness. And I get the carnation/clove too, but in a light touch, not Tiger Balm levels of clove. It’s surprisingly not a beast, given its potentially strong notes. Just comes across as a light layer of spicy, sweet, and mysterious. Fun fact for the record: it was named after one of the two main characters in the film *God’s Own Country*.

**D’Annam Kimono**: Ohh, I love this! Silky soft floral (my nose is insisting on rose on this first wearing, though the notes say magnolia, and I can see that too), with soap and powdery cosmetics, and a hint of steamed white rice to tie the romance to everyday reality. It feels old-school romantic; elegant without being haughty, pretty without being saccharine. Really good! So far I’m quite impressed with D’Annam. After a few more wearings: of the whole batch, this is the one I want more of. Kimono for the win!

**Parfum d’Empire Mal-Aime**: Apparently a blend of (or at least impression of) plants that are considered weeds. It does have a “weeding the garden on a warm dry day” overall scent, but I’m impressed that it doesn’t feel purely vegetal-bitter. It’s herbal-aromatic enough to smell like, say, a shampoo with a lot of “natural” ingredients. Subtle sillage and moderate longevity. I feel like people who like the smell of tomato leaf would like this, even though it doesn’t precisely smell like tomato leaf. It’s just in that same family of smells.

**Indult My Ju-Ju**: At first sniff: frosting. Then it soons settles down into a dusty, slightly chocolatey tonka. It’s got something between the territory of Play-Doh and bubblegum in there, chewy and sweet, though not pure-sugar sweet. A bit tangy and juicy. It does feel sort of teenage, but the blend is sophisticated enough to be appreciated at any age. Later note: the drydown is especially cuddly and soft! A solidly wearable perfume.

**Parfum Satori Mizunara**: Crisp ocean air and astringent citrus. Fair amount of Iso E Super. Good if you’re looking for a “cold ocean wind” scent, though I’m not sure that I am at the moment. Imagine my surprise at looking at the notes and discovering it’s supposed to be whiskey and herbs and trees. Well, maybe on further wearings I’ll notice more of that.",3,1751673997.0,fragrance,2,1.0,False
1lrwzsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BSBubbaRobinsonLuv/comments/1lrwzsk/hydrate_yourselves/,Hydrate Yourselves,"AI Overview



+13
To hydrate yourself, you should drink plenty of fluids, especially water, and eat water-rich foods. Staying hydrated is crucial for overall health, and you can achieve it through various methods like drinking water, consuming fruits and vegetables, or even enjoying a glass of milk. 
Here's a more detailed look at how to stay hydrated:
1. Drink Plenty of Water: 
Water is the best and most readily available source of hydration. 
Aim to drink water regularly throughout the day, not just when you feel thirsty. 
Consider carrying a reusable water bottle to remind you to drink. 
You can add flavor to your water with lemon, lime, or cucumber slices. 
Be mindful of urine color; lemonade is a good indicator of proper hydration, while apple juice is too dark. 
2. Eat Water-Rich Foods:
Fruits and vegetables can contribute significantly to your daily fluid intake.
Examples include:
Fruits: Watermelon, strawberries, grapes, cantaloupe, oranges
Vegetables: Cucumbers, celery
Soups and broths also provide hydration. 
3. Other Beverages:
Diluted squash and fruit juice can also help you stay hydrated. 
While caffeine can have a diuretic effect, moderate consumption of coffee and tea is generally okay. 
Sports drinks can be beneficial during intense or prolonged exercise to replenish electrolytes. 
Coconut water is a good source of hydration and electrolytes. 
Milk, especially skim or low-fat, can also contribute to hydration and provide essential nutrients. 
4. When to Hydrate More:
Hot weather: Increase your fluid intake during hot weather or when exercising outdoors. 
Illness: When you're sick, your body needs more fluids to recover. 
Exercise: Drink water before, during, and after physical activity. 
5. Recognize Signs of Dehydration: 
Feeling thirsty is a sign of mild dehydration.
Other signs include dark yellow, strong-smelling urine, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, and feeling tired.
Seek medical help if you experience confusion, fainting, rapid heartbeat or breathing, or can't urinate.

We’re at 1600km driven so far post-landing in St Johns and each day we see something that easily matches anywhere else we’ve been as far as scenery and views go. 

Those who think the west coast (boooo!) have the only stunning landscapes are missing out on something special… driving Gros Morne today was one of the most beautiful drives I’ve done in my life…

…

…that being said, what’s up with Robin’s? I’m no coffee snob or connoisseur in the least. I can count the amount of espresso’s I’ve had in my life on one hand, but that regular “dark roast” I had the other day tasted like “coffee flavoured water”-lite. 

Are you folks ok? Did Robin’s hurt you when you were a newborn province and you can’t escape their watch? Do you need me to call someone?

To those employed by Robin’s, I mean no disrespect, you do what you have to to survive, but, if you need help, let us know. The rest of Canada is ready to rise up and help you. 

They say “if you see something, say something”, so here I am. 

Sincerely, your newfound friend. 

P.S. I did read the rules, and it’s possible I’ve technically violated a few of them, I hope the mods know I mean no disrespect…except of course in the area of coffee places. :)

1lrwnb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1lrwnb4/can_you_make_cold_brew_with_ground_coffee/,Can you make cold brew with ground coffee?,"As a coffee lover, I've always been fascinated by the different ways to brew my favorite drink. One question that often comes up is whether you can make cold brew with ground coffee. The short answer is yes, you absolutely can!

Cold brew coffee has become super popular in recent years, and for good reason. It's smooth, less acidic, and perfect for those hot summer days when you need a caffeine fix without the heat. But here's the thing - you don't need fancy equipment or special coffee beans to make it at home.

I've been experimenting with cold brew for a while now, and I've found that using regular ground coffee works just fine. The key is to use a coarse grind, similar to what you'd use for a French press. This helps prevent your cold brew from becoming too bitter or muddy.

The process is pretty simple. You mix your ground coffee with cold water, let it steep for 12-24 hours (depending on how strong you like it), then strain it. The result is a concentrated coffee that you can dilute with water or milk.

Now, while you can definitely make cold brew with regular ground coffee, having the right equipment can make the process a lot easier. I recently discovered some great iced coffee makers that have really upped my cold brew game. You can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers

These makers are designed specifically for cold brew and iced coffee, which means less mess and more consistent results. Plus, they often come with built-in filters, so you don't have to worry about straining your coffee afterward.

One thing I've learned is that the quality of your coffee matters. While you can use any ground coffee, using freshly ground, high-quality beans will give you a much better flavor. I prefer medium to dark roasts for cold brew, as they tend to produce a richer taste.

Another tip: don't be afraid to experiment with ratios. I usually start with a 1:4 coffee to water ratio, but you might prefer it stronger or weaker. It's all about finding what works for you.

If you're new to cold brew or just want to step up your game, I highly recommend checking out some dedicated iced coffee makers. They can really simplify the process and help you achieve that perfect cold brew every time. You can find a great selection here: https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers

In conclusion, yes, you can absolutely make cold brew with ground coffee. It's a simple, affordable way to enjoy smooth, refreshing coffee at home. Whether you're using a mason jar or a specialized iced coffee maker, the key is patience and good quality coffee. Happy brewing!",1,1751672712.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1lrwju6,https://i.redd.it/ps1ofwkb1yaf1.jpeg,The Mirror Knows Evan's Secret,"# The Mirror Knows Evan's Secret

 I live with my boyfriend, Evan, in a little one-bedroom house we rent just outside Salem, Massachusetts — old place, creaky pipes, uneven floorboards, draft in the kitchen window we keep forgetting to fix. It’s not much, but it’s ours. We split rent and chores and bad takeout. Most nights we fall asleep to the sound of the neighbor’s dog losing its mind at squirrels in the yard. Yeah — domestic bliss.

Evan and I met in college — it was during our sophomore year at UMass Amherst. I was sitting in the back row of a medieval history lecture I was only taking for gen-ed credit, doodling in the margins of my notebook. 

He was seated just in front of me and he turned to me and asked if the professor always looked like he just woke up from a haunted nap. I snorted. Long story short,  we’ve practically been joined at the hip since then. 

He’s originally from Barre, Vermont. Real small-town kid. He grew up surrounded by trees, not people. He talks about it like it was equal parts boring and sacred. He still says “soda” instead of “tonic,” which drives my Boston-raised brain crazy.

Evan’s a freelance copywriter — mostly ad stuff for outdoor gear companies. I teach piano lessons part-time and work the counter at a restaurant in Marblehead. We both graduated into a garbage job market and never really recovered, but we make do.

Evan and I have been together for three years. Moved in after one year together.  We still fight over stupid stuff — whose turn it is to take the compost bin out, who forgot to Venmo for utilities — but he makes me laugh when I least expect it, and there's something soft and decent in him I trust.

Which is why this next part is so hard to explain.

\---

It was a Thursday night like any other. We’d eaten takeout sushi, washed down with cheap sake from the liquor store down the street. We settled in to binge-watch one of Evan’s shows — some true crime doc that had him hooked. Eventually, we shuffled to the bathroom to brush our teeth and wind down.

The bathroom is tiny — barely enough space for the two of us. The paint under the sink is peeling, revealing a sad, cold blue that seems to suck warmth out of the room no matter how hot the water gets. We stood side by side, the chipped mug with a faded whale on it holding our toothbrushes resting on the cracked porcelain sink. 

It was one of those moments that feels so normal you forget it’s even happening while it’s happening.

Until something breaks.

Evan was on my left, humming softly, some tune I’d played for my student earlier that afternoon. I hadn’t even realized I’d played it out loud enough for him to pick up the melody. I smiled, and I winked at him through the mirror. 

Anyway we were just going through the motions under the dim bathroom light when I glanced at the mirror and noticed Evan’s reflection didn’t quite keep up with him. It lagged just a fraction — barely there, but enough to make my stomach tighten. I blinked, shook my head, and told myself I must be seeing things or the poor lighting in the bathroom.  Still, the feeling lingered. 

When  he leaned forward to spit into the sink, his reflection stayed upright. It must have stayed there for a second, maybe two. Then it caught up — like a bad video call buffering.

I froze and looked at him directly — and he was fine. He didn’t seem to notice that the mirror had lagged. Instead he rinsed, dried his hands, kissed me on the cheek and he went to bed. Within five minutes he was fast asleep, as always. 

I didn’t tell Evan. I couldn’t. I didn’t even know how to start that conversation.

“Hey, babe, your reflection isn’t syncing up with your body — maybe you’re haunted?”

Yeah, I don’t think so.”   

\---

 I don't know how long I lay awake staring at the ceiling still completely perplexed at what I'd just seen. I just didn't know what to make of it? I thought about the hallucinogens I’d messed around with back in college — psilocybin once or twice, acid just the one time. Nothing intense and of course weed, which I still partake every once in a while. 

But still… Maybe something was catching up with me. Maybe I’d cracked something open and forgotten to close it. Maybe something was coming back to bite me in the ass? Or maybe I was losing my mind? Both prospects aren't sitting right with me. I mean wow, pick your poison right? 

\---

That night I barely slept. I told *myself I imagined it. Maybe I was tired. Maybe the light hit it wrong.* But it kept happening.

During the following days I started watching him more closely. I’d catch him reaching for a coffee mug, and for a split second I’d look at the window behind him, just to make sure the reflection was doing the same thing. Most of the time, it was. Or at least close enough to pretend.

But sometimes… it wasn’t.

Sometimes it was off by half a beat. Just enough to notice. Just enough to make my stomach flip. Once, I swear, the reflection smiled before he did — like it knew what he was going to feel,  like it was playing along.

I kept telling myself I was being paranoid, sleep-deprived, anxious; anything to convince myself there was a reasonable explanation for the all the weird shit I've been seeing.  I even Googled ""mirror lag"" to see if maybe it was a lighting thing, or some optical glitch I didn't understand. I found a Reddit thread where someone said their mirror made people look “too alive.” I closed the tab and didn’t sleep that night again. 

Evan didn’t seem different. He still kissed me on the forehead when I was working. He still cracked dumb jokes during dinner. Still cuddled with me in bed like everything was normal.

Three nights later, I saw it again — just out of sync. They were subtle, and easy to miss — a smile too slow to catch up.  Once, I saw the reflection smile when Evan wasn’t smiling at all.

\---

Then there was the bathtub incident. 

We were fooling around in the tub together, it wasn’t particularly romantic, just a spur of the moment thing. The shower was sputtering a thin spray, sounding all clogged up like it was begging to be replaced.

Evan was standing in front of me;  I was kneeling in front of him, caught up in the moment when suddenly the mirror above the sink fogged with steam — caught my eye when I glanced up. 

At first, I just saw blurred shapes and soft colors, but then the fog seemed to thin, and the reflection sharpened.

I caught sight of Evan’s face. But something was… off.

It took awhile for me to realize his reflection wasn’t focused on me. The real Evan was looking down at me but his reflection was staring straight ahead — right at the mirror, right at me.

Then it did something I have neve been able to shake since. It smiled. 

 I froze up and  blinked hard once as I watched the reflection’s lips curled into a slow, unnatural smile.

Not the smile Evan had, but the smile the mirror *wanted* me to see. 

My whole body tensed at the reflection’s eyes — dark and unblinking, fixed on mine like a predator sizing up its prey. I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t. I sprang up, slipped out of the tub, naked and dripping, and bolted straight to the bedroom, locking the door behind me. 

Maybe ten seconds later, Evan turned the knob once and knocked.

 “Claire? What’s going on?” 

He sounded confused.  

I leaned against the door, water soaking into the hardwood floor, trying to breathe like It was the only thing keeping me from losing my fucking mind.

Evan just stood there on the other side of the door like he wasn’t sure if he should press the matter or let it go. My heartbeat was pounding so hard he might as well have heard it on the other side of the door. 

“I’m ok Evan, I just have the cramps,” was all I could think of to say.

\---

That was the moment I stopped pretending this was just stress or sleep deprivation or some leftover acid echo from college.

Something was *wrong*. And I was the only one seeing it.

A week after the bathtub… thing, I stopped making excuses. I didn’t want to believe it. But I couldn’t keep pretending everything was fine while his reflection looked like it wanted to crawl out of the glass and wear him like a coat.

So I waited until Friday night. Evan always takes longer in the bathroom after dinner — brushing his teeth, doing that slow, methodical hair routine I always made fun of him for,  like he's prepping  for a magazine shoot instead of bedtime — something. 

I knew I'd have a window.

I told him I needed to finish some invoices for my students and sat down at the kitchen table with my laptop open. I kept my phone in my hoodie pocket until I heard the water start running. Then I got up, walked down the hall, and left it propped face-up on the hallway bookshelf — just barely angled toward the bathroom mirror facing the door which was half open. 

It looked stupid — like something out of a found footage movie. But it was all I could think to do. 

I told myself I just wanted peace of mind. A little confirmation that I was overthinking this. 

 I don’t know why I bothered lying to myself, not when I already knew.

Later that night, after he’d gone to bed, I locked myself in the bathroom with the lights off, slid down to the floor with a blanket, and pressed play.

At first, it was normal. Just Evan brushing his teeth. Spitting. Rinsing, gargling,  running a hand through his hair.

But then, around the two-minute mark, something moved.

Evan turned his body slightly — like he was leaning down to grab something from under the sink — but his reflection didn’t move with him. 

Not at all.

It just stayed there, standing upright and Staring.

The reflection turned its head —  and looked *directly straight at the camera* like it knew where I had hidden it. 

It looked directly at *me*.

Then it vanished — just a glitch and the reflection synced up again. 

\---

The following night I made up some excuse about feeling sick and I  spent the night on the couch, curled up under a scratchy throw blanket that smelled like dust and lavender. Evan didn’t question it. He just kissed my forehead and said, “Hope you feel better,” before disappearing down the hall.

But I didn’t feel better. I felt like I was being hunted — from inside the glass.

I started avoiding mirrors entirely. 

 I got dressed using the oven door’s reflection and brushed my teeth with my back to the bathroom sink. I didn’t even check my face before work. I just couldn’t bring myself to look, afraid of what might look back.

Evan didn’t notice. Or maybe he did and  didn’t say anything. He was busy with a deadline, tapping away at his laptop from the couch. I kept watching him when he wasn’t looking — trying to find something wrong in the real version of him. But everything looked… fine. Normal.

That night, I tried to sleep in our bed again.

*Tried.*

I woke up sometime after 3 a.m. — to a creeping sense that something wasn’t quite right. You know that feeling when a room *feels* occupied, even if no one’s making a sound? 

I rolled over.

Evan was asleep— mouth slightly open, one arm raised above his head and the other folded over his stomach.  His chest rose and fell, slow and steady.

But in the mirror on the far wall — I saw movement.

I tried convincing myself it was just the angle, until my eyes adjusted to realize: the reflection wasn’t lying down.

It was *sitting up*.

Evan’s body was still next to me sound asleep. But in the mirror, he was sitting in bed. His head turned slightly toward me. 

I didn’t move,  I didn’t breathe, I didn’t want to catch its attention. But the reflection stared at me with a blank expression of *awful stillness*, like it was studying me. 

Measuring something, or deciding. 

And then — OH God — it lifted one hand and raised a finger to its lips.

It said  “Shhh.”

That sound — that one syllable — didn’t come from Evan’s body beside me. It came from the mirror. From the thing inside it. Soft, with an almost deceptive gentleness, like a lullaby made out of knives.

Then it moved.

I don’t know how, or when, but the reflection stepped out of the mirror. It made no sound—not even the breaking of glass or the crack of the mirror. It inched closer to the bed, slowly, biding its time like it had all the time in the world — like it had every right to be there. 

My skin went cold, then hot, then cold again. My vision narrowed, like I was about to pass out.  

I couldn’t look away as I watched this thing slowly approaching the bed. 

I don’t know how long I stayed like that — seconds, minutes, years? It might as well have been. 

It felt like the air around me had snapped tight, and nothing was getting through. 

 It walked to to my side of the bed where I lay frozen under the blankets, and then— It leaned in and bent over me

 Its face hovered inches from mine, it was Evan’s in every way  but the eyes, they were empty,  and devoid of any semblance of the Evan I loved. It stared as if trying to memorize me. 

I couldn’t move — I didn’t dare move. 

I wanted to scream, to cry out to shove it away — anything. 

But my body didn’t answer. 

I just shut my eyes — tight. 

I didn't just feel afraid, I felt small like prey, like a snail retreating into its fragile shell.  

My heart pounded so loudly, I wish it would wake Evan — the real Evan. If he was still real.

But eventually, I heard it step back.

One foot, then the other.

When I dared to crack my eyes open — just the smallest sliver — the mirror showed only our reflection again. 

Evan was still lying beside me, asleep.

Everything was exactly where it should be — except me. 

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night. I kept my eyes closed and prayed the sun would come soon.

\---

The next morning, I left the house.

I didn’t even tell Evan where I was going — I just mumbled something about needing to drop off something at work. I grabbed my bag, got into my car and waited until my fingers stopped shaking enough to turn the ignition. 

I pulled into a CVS parking lot and sat in my car for almost twenty minutes before I worked up the nerve to call her. Leah.

Evan’s older sister, the “cool one” — full sleeve tattooed arms, piercing laugh, calls bullshit on everyone, even their mom.

She’d always treated me like family. Once, when I was sick with the flu and Evan was out of town, she Grub-Hubbed me soup and texted, *Don’t let my idiot brother poison you with oregano tea again.*

She was the only person I could think of who might understand him better than I did.

She picked up on the second ring.

“Claire?” she said, surprised. “Hey! Everything okay?”

I didn’t even know where to start. I didn’t want to sound crazy.

But the second I opened my mouth, the words came pouring out in this weird, halting stream — not all the details, just enough: *Something’s wrong with Evan. Or with the house. Or with me. I don’t know. I just—*

I must’ve been babbling at that point, because her voice changed.

“Whoa, hey, slow down. You’re okay. You’re safe, right?”

“Yeah,” I lied. “I just… I needed to ask you something.”

“Of course.”

I swallowed, but my throat was so dry I could barely get it out. “Has Evan ever been… weird about mirrors? Like, growing up?”

Leah was silent for a long time, and for a second I thought I’d lost the call.

“Hello?” I said. “Are you there?”

“Yeah,” she answered finally. “Yeah, I’m here… what kind of weird?”

“Like —” I pinched the bridge of my nose. “Did he ever say they made him uncomfortable? Or that he didn’t like the way his reflection looked? Or—God, I don’t know. Did he ever say anything about… it not matching?”

There was more silence, which felt heavier now.

Then, quietly, she said: “You’re not imagining this.”

She told me when Evan was little — six, maybe seven — he had night terrors. Screamed about reflections watching him. He said his reflection wouldn't let him sleep at night, and that the the reflection *moved first.*

*Once*, Leah said, their mom found him standing completely still in front of the hallway mirror. He just stood there staring at it. When she asked what he was doing, he said, *“Making sure it doesn't come back.”*

“I remember that so clearly,” Leah said. “I asked him what he meant, and he told me, ‘The boy in the mirror is right where he belongs.""

I felt my skin crawl.

“I thought he was just being dramatic — we all did.”  she said. “Or dreaming with his eyes open. 

But after that… I don’t know.”

She paused again. Her voice shifted — like she was rummaging through old memories she hadn’t looked at in years.

“He was scared before,” she said quietly. “Like, really scared. He’d cry if the bathroom door stayed open at night, or if he caught his reflection by accident. But after that... I don’t know. He changed.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, careful not to push.

“He got loud,” she said. “Like... weirdly loud. He started cracking jokes constantly, like he couldn’t help it. Always wanted attention. But not in a bad way, I guess, just—different. He used to be so shy, always hiding behind me leg or ducking out of photos. And then suddenly, it was like someone flipped a switch.”

There was a pause. I heard her pacing.

“I remember our parents being relieved. Like, finally, he was acting like a ‘normal’ kid. But I always thought it felt a little... I don’t know. Off. Forced, maybe. Like he was performing what he thought ‘okay’ looked like.”

She hesitated, as if unsure how to say what she was going to say next. After a long pause, she sounded uncertain.

“I used to tell myself it was just him growing up. But now... sometimes I wonder if the Evan we know is really him at all. Like the real one got lost somewhere else — stuck in that reflection.”

My fingers clenched the phone a little tighter. My chest felt so tight I felt like the wind got knocked out of me.  

The idea that the Evan I loved might not be *real* — that the boy trapped in the mirror was the *true* Evan — made my skin crawl and my heart break all at once.

I swallowed hard and forced the words out.

 I could barely manage to raise my voice above a whisper, sounding  shaky and raw.

“But if that’s true... then what am I living with? What’s been here all this time?”

Then she said it:

“You need to leave. Tonight. Just get your stuff and go — you can stay with me for a while.” 

\---

That night, I packed a small bag — just the essentials, nothing too obvious —  change of clothes, my laptop, some cash, and my favorite worn sweater Evan got me for my birthday.

I found Evan  in the kitchen, reheating leftovers. He smiled when he saw me.

“Oh Hey,” he said. “You were out awhile. 

I hesitated, then I made up some excuse about how Brent — my  manager, asked me to fill in at the last minute for one of the new hires who couldn’t make it to work today. 

I felt guilty lying to him,  but I also didn’t want to explain why I was suddenly afraid of the bathroom mirror. Or why I stopped sleeping in the same bed with him. 

I walked to the hallways where I picked up my stuff. When I reached for the door, his voice called out from behind me. 

“Claire?” 

I hesitated a bit before I turned around.  

 Evan was halfway down the hall, barefoot, holding a glass of water. His eyes looked confused, like he wasn’t sure what to say or how to fix whatever was wrong.

“Are you going somewhere?”

There was no anger in his voice, no hint of suspicion. Just that same quiet softness that made me fall in love with him.

 I almost stayed.

I tried to speak, but I couldn’t quite find the right words. I wanted to tell him how much I loved him — that whoever, whatever he was, it didn’t matter.

Then I saw it, his reflection kept moving — like it was trying to break free from a threshold it was never meant to cross. 

That’s when I truly realized: the Evan I fell for — the one who made me laugh the first time we met, who moshed with me at the Dropkick Murphys show, who stayed up late handing out candy on Halloween, who held my hand through every bad day and stayed calm while helping me look for my keys for the hundredth time — didn’t really belong here.

He stood there, silent and solid, trapped in between somewhere neither here nor there.

It took every ounce of strength to say, “I just need some air."" It felt so forced and he knew it too.

“I’ll keep the porch light on,” he said. 

I stepped outside, greeted by a cool evening breeze that should have promised relief but delivered nothing.

Behind me, I heard the door click shut — but the silence that followed was louder than any goodbye.

\---

It’s been almost a week now since I left. 

 Evan texted a few times — short things. *Miss you.* *Just let me know you’re okay.* *I’m still here when you’re ready to come back.*

I don’t know what to say back. I keep writing drafts and deleting them. I miss him —  of course I do. But every time I think about going back, I remember the mirror. 

 And now I’ve started catching things. Small things. My reflection blinking out of sync,  a smile that comes a half-second late. One night I thought I saw my own hand move before I did.

I haven’t looked at a mirror directly in days.

I wash my face using the little black square of my phone with the screen off. I brush my teeth with my eyes closed. 

 At work, I avoid the wine bar’s mirror like it’s a live wire.

Sometimes I still hear that whisper — *Shhh* — like it’s waiting for me to slip. To let my guard down.

\---

One night, without meaning to, I found myself driving near the house again.

The porch light was still on. 

I kept driving. 

For a moment, I thought I saw Evan in the window — just standing there perfectly still, as if waiting for me.

Or maybe it was the other guy in the reflection.

It's hard to tell anymore.

They live together and own a house together too. It's hybrid working so the employees are home most of the week and no one tends to come into the office on Fridays apart from Dave. I have been in the office a few Fridays recently, and twice Sophie's sister, Ellie (F29) has turned up to the office for seemingly no reason. She is not affiliated with the company at all outside of occasionally helping Sophie with events. Both times, she brings Dave coffee, they go into his office and the door is closed (usually his door is open unless he has a meeting) and I hear a lot of giggling from Sophie. Then, about an hour or so later, they both leave together. The whole energy is just odd and sort of embued with tension, and the first time it happened she definitely seemed pretty shocked when I opened the office door to her. I mentioned this to another guy at work and he said the same thing has happened a few times when he's been in the office and he also has suspicions. 

What's also important to note is that about 2 years ago, Dave randomly sent me strange, flirty messages at 1am. It was nothing explicit, but he told me he was on MDMA, and missed me coz we don't chat much outside of work anymore (we've never really had a friendship), and tried to video call me 🤮. He said it was a mistake but only after I had rejected the call, and said he hoped he hadn't ""woken anyone"". This was a few months after I had gone through a break up, so I guess he was trying to feel out if I had started dating anyone new yet. I've shown the messages to friends and they agree that it looks like he was trying to figure out if I was interested. So it seems like he's someone who is open to cheating...

Also I'm not really sure if this is particularly relevant, but Ellie the most flirtatious, ""baby-girl"" person I have ever met. She talks almost like a cutsy anime girl, I've never seen anything like it in real life before. Two of the men in the office have told me they were uncomfortable with how flirtatious she was when they met her.

Anyway, Sophie is lovely I just feel terrible that I have this information that I'm not telling her. I wouldn't even know what to say to feel it out. Like I don't know if maybe Ellie and Dave have a shared hobby, and Sophie knows they hang out and it's all fine? I don't speak to Sophie that much so it would be a very out of the blue message.

It's just really against my principles to do nothing, and I also hate that Dave has been bringing Ellie to the office infront of employees, banking on the fact that no one will say anything! I'm aware though, that if Sophie and Dave break up, the company might be doomed since they co-own it. I'm planning on leaving the job soon, partly because Dave is so unpleasant to work with. But the rest of the people I work with are great and have kids and I'd hate for them to lose their jobs.

Achieving youthful, radiant skin is a desire shared by many. To make skin look younger, a combination of natural remedies and effective skincare routines can work wonders. Incorporate these secrets into your daily life to reveal a more youthful complexion.

First and foremost, hydration is key. Drinking plenty of water not only keeps your body functioning optimally but also ensures your skin is well-hydrated, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Aim for at least eight glasses of water daily. Additionally, using a high-quality moisturizer helps retain moisture, giving your skin a plump and smooth appearance.

Another secret is incorporating antioxidants into your skincare routine. Products containing vitamin C and vitamin E can help fight off free radicals, which cause premature aging. Look for serums and creams that prioritize these powerful ingredients for an instant glow.

Exfoliation also plays a crucial role. Regularly exfoliating your skin removes dead skin cells and promotes cell turnover, making your skin look fresher and younger. Use gentle exfoliants that suit your skin type—scrubs, chemical exfoliants with AHAs, or even natural options like coffee grounds or sugar.

Sun protection is a non-negotiable step in any skincare routine. UV rays significantly contribute to aging skin, so apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every day, even on cloudy days. This helps shield your skin from damage, ensuring it remains youthful over time.

Finally, don't underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. Beauty sleep is real; adequate rest helps your skin repair and regenerate, resulting in a more youthful look. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to boost your skin's rejuvenation process.

Making skin look younger is possible with the right strategies. By focusing on hydration, antioxidants, exfoliation, sun protection, and restful sleep, you can unveil a vibrant, youthful complexion that defies age.

I’m 46, Australian-made, curvy, demisexual, biromantic, and polyamorous with a witch’s heart and a deeply lived life. Eternal optimist navigating the world with a bleeding heart, sarcasm, and not enough sleep… I’m winging it - with a side of coffee, offerings to Hekate, and prayers that may be occasionally inappropriate (in the best way). I’m not here to escape the chaos - just to share it with someone who might understand its magic.

I’m looking to meet someone who’s open to a real connection - flirty, thoughtful, maybe a little indulgent - that doesn’t need to fit a template to be meaningful.

My world is layered: I have children who keep me on my toes, a loud and loyal chosen family, a wild job that makes a difference, and a cavoodle who supervises my every spell and snack. I sit pretty comfortably in the world of non-traditional relationships - and have a few that make life richer, not messier.

Spiritually, I walk with land and lineage - a foot in both the Celtic and Norse traditions, walking a path shaped by intuition,  story, and reverence. My magic is rooted in the soil and the breath between words. I light candles for my ancestors, honour the old gods, and make offerings at crossroads - literal and spiritual. If that resonates with you, we might just speak the same language. I’m most at home with people who understand that part of me - and I’ll be honest, I don’t currently have a partner who does, so I’d love to find that.    

I swing between philosophical rabbit holes, ridiculous memes, and late-night confessionals. I crave voice chats and emotionally present connections - the kind that can move between flirtation, introspection, and irreverent laughter without missing a beat. Spontaneous check-ins, long conversations that stretch between desire and depth, and connections that feel curious, present, and a little bit bold? I’m here for it.

I’m ultimately looking for someone to share life with - a primary connection, ideally in person, but I know that sometimes Australia makes that hard with location (I'm quite rural). So, I acknowledge that sometimes the deepest bonds grow across time zones and screens, and that’s okay. If you’re open to building something genuine, loving, and generous, I’m here for it. One of the gifts of polyamory is that we get to shape our connections in ways that truly work for us - no moulds to squeeze into, just something real we create together.

If you’re poly or ENM, not afraid of depth, and open to something grounded in honesty, attraction, and emotional availability -  let’s talk. I’m not asking for grand gestures or fairy tales. I’m asking for your presence. Effort. Truth. Someone who doesn’t make me guess how they feel or where I stand. Someone who sees my softness and strength and says, “Yes. Her. I want to meet her there.”

Flirty banter? Yes please.
Weird passions? Bring ’em.
“wyd” energy? I’ll pass, thanks.

Important info! 
I’m not interested in “wyd” chats, transactional flirtation, or people who expect me to carry the vibe. Skip the “hey.” Tell me where you’re from, your age, what you’re devoted to, who you light candles for, or the last thing that made your skin tingle.

I’ll go first: I just saw Hadestown for the second time last night and my skin still has goosebumps. I’m heading to a Brigid workshop today - she’s walked beside me my whole life. And I have a passion for collecting indie tarot and oracle decks. That's just scratching my surface.

(Because of the workshop and time zones, don't be deterred by how long this has been up or not getting a fast response,  I may not get to respond until tonight or tomorrow).

1lrwcnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1lrwcnb/just_want_to_share_my_journey_to_paying_off_my/,Just want to share my journey to paying off my debt.,"  
Hello everyone!

I'm excited to share my debt payoff journey with you all, and more importantly, to show that becoming debt-free is absolutely possible! It's been an incredible learning experience, and while my debt might seem small compared to some, I quickly realized how fast things can spiral if not addressed head-on.



# My Debt Journey & Progress



Here's a look at my debts and where I stand:

1. **Credit Card (Bank):** This card had a 22% APR and a $5,000 limit. **I'm thrilled to announce it's now PAID OFF!** What a relief!
2. **Honda Civic (2018):** My car loan was for $20,000 at a 1.2% interest rate, with monthly payments of $318.22. **This will be completely paid off by the end of July!**
3. **Final Credit Card:** This card has a $7,500 limit with a 22% APR. I have a remaining balance of $6,500. While the minimum payment is $150, I'm aggressively paying **$2,000 a month** to get rid of it as quickly as possible.

This journey has been a huge eye-opener for me, highlighting things I once took for granted. I've learned to manage stress, realizing it's a part of life that I can control through my perspective. My friends and family have even noticed the positive changes in me, which has been incredibly rewarding. There were tough days, and tears were shed, but if you truly believe in your goal and keep pushing forward, you can make it happen.



# Strategies That Helped Me



Here are some actionable tips that made a real difference in my journey:

* **Prioritize Sleep:** Get your 8 hours! Quality sleep is crucial for mental clarity and decision-making.
* **Mindful Spending:** I started looking for every opportunity to save. It's astonishing how much we spend on small, seemingly insignificant things like daily coffees or snacks. Before buying something, ask yourself about its true value and how long that value will last. A candy bar disappears quickly, but strong relationships with friends and family last a lifetime.
* **Track Your Spending:** I still write down every expense. There's something powerful about seeing those numbers on paper. It keeps me accountable and focused.
* **Explore Passive Income:** I'm actively researching and working on ways to generate passive income to further accelerate my financial goals.
* **Ruthless Expense Cutting:** I went through all my subscriptions and unnecessary expenses and cut them back. Think Netflix, Amazon Prime, and those daily coffee runs.
* **Become Frugal:** Continuously review your bank statements to understand your cash flow. Embrace frugality until it becomes second nature.
* **Workplace Wellness:** If you're working long hours, remember to stay hydrated. And always maintain professionalism at work; your actions and words there should stay there. Keep your debt payoff goal at the forefront of your mind to help maintain self-control and clarity. You'll become unstoppable!
* **Embrace Change:** Don't be afraid to make big changes in your habits and lifestyle. You've got this!

Remember, the money you earn is valuable. You worked hard for it, and it has a purpose. While it might sound intense, there's a unique sense of accomplishment and worth when you've put in the effort to achieve something significant.

Everyone has something they're striving for. Your debt doesn't have to be a crushing burden. Once you set a clear path and commit to it, you'll feel a lightness and freedom that's truly empowering.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. Sharing this means the world to me.

**Don't stress about debt—plan for it.**

Am I being too harsh?,"I (32 F, India) am stuck in a weird dilemma with an arranged marriage rishta. The guy is a pilot—first officer, has been flying for 2.5 years, seems financially stable, and has a respectable job on paper.

But the problem is…he seems extremely underconfident and socially awkward. He avoids calls and video chats, barely makes any effort in conversations, and always keeps his social media private or hidden. When we met in person (twice), I noticed odd things—like him not knowing how to stir coffee despite being a frequent traveler and staying in hotels during layovers. Also, his conversation skills are quite weak, both in English and in general.

He also admitted he’s “not a call person” and doesn’t like video calls even with family. His texting style is very bland and immature, and although he shows interest in marriage, he says he’s “90% sure” about this match but doesn’t bother to get to know me deeply, saying he’s afraid of overstepping because it’s an arranged setup.We had some good chats initially where i felt he was making efforts to gauge our compatibility but later on now then chats are only surface level and draining sometimes!

This whole situation has made me uncomfortable and confused. My family really likes him because he has a stable job, and they’re quite invested in this rishta. But I can’t shake off the feeling that something is off here—like low confidence, lack of self esteem,poor social skills, or lack of emotional depth. Also, I don’t feel excited or emotionally connected to him at all, and I’m scared of being pushed into this marriage out of pressure.
Despite being a pilot, he lacks grooming, communication skills and confidence.

The dictionary defines Independence as 'noun: the fact or state of being independent.' I found another definition on Google that defines independence as 'the state of being free of the control of some other person, country or entity.'

It's ironic we're supposed to be celebrating independence today since more people in the U.S are less free to be independent.

I think the most concerning thing about what's happening today, as a U.S citizen, is that not only do we not continuously educate ourselves about our own rights, but also that information is becoming harder and harder to access.

This isn't meant to be a political post. I wanted to share that the app prototype I've been working on is live. I should've made this update a few weeks ago. I got caught up in so many things, I forgot to post about it before Father's Day. 

It's been 4 months since my dog crossed the rainbow bridge. I started this project to keep my mind busy while grieving.

I wanted to build something using AI that could help me answer civic concern questions I had like:
“Wait… is that legal?”
“Does this align with democratic values?”
“What part of the Constitution covers this?”

I don't know if others feel the same way or are asking the same questions to understand civics clearly. Feel free to message me so I can send you the app link where you can play with it and provide feedback.

Now that the prototype is done, live, and I'm using it regularly, I'm thinking about adding a user dashboard feature, perhaps data visualization stuff, but most definitely finding better sets of truthful information because U.S government website pages are becoming untruthful or page can't be found 0_o.

Like, I used to be that person chugging coffee at 6 AM and crashing by 2 PM, but **How To Prepare Matcha Tea – Easy & Delicious Beginner's Guide** has literally become my go-to resource for starting each day right.

To be honest, I was super intimidated at first. The whole whisking thing seemed way too fancy for my lazy morning self. But here's what I learned: it's actually not that complicated once you get the hang of it, and the energy boost is *so* much smoother than coffee.

👉 *Want to transform your morning routine with sustained energy that lasts all day? Join thousands discovering the perfect matcha ritual that fits seamlessly into busy lifestyles.*

**Why Quality Actually Matters (And I Learned This The Hard Way)**

Okay, so my first attempt was... rough. I bought the cheapest matcha powder I could find at the grocery store, thinking ""green powder is green powder, right?"" Wrong. So wrong. The taste was bitter, gritty, and honestly made me question why anyone would choose this over a latte.

Then my friend who lived in Japan for two years told me something that changed everything: Always use 70-80-degree water, as anything hotter will burn the matcha, resulting in a bitter taste. But even more importantly, she explained that ceremonial-grade matcha is completely different from culinary-grade stuff. We're talking about tea leaves that are shade-grown for weeks before harvest, stone-ground into this incredibly fine powder that dissolves like silk.

I invested in a proper ceremonial-grade matcha (*yes, it's more expensive, but hear me out*), and the difference was night and day. The color was this vibrant emerald green, and the taste was naturally sweet with this subtle umami depth that I'd never experienced before.

**The Texture Secret That Changes Everything**

Here's something most **How To Prepare Matcha Tea – Easy & Delicious Beginner's Guide** tutorials don't emphasize enough: To achieve the perfect foam texture, sift your matcha powder before whisking.

I skipped this step for weeks because I thought it was just being fancy. But once I started sifting, the whole experience transformed. No more clumps, no more gritty bits at the bottom of my bowl. Just this smooth, frothy layer that makes you feel like you're drinking liquid velvet.

The whisking technique matters too. Whisk in a 'W' or 'M' motion until a smooth layer of froth forms, and trust me, there's something almost meditative about this process. It's like a two-minute mindfulness practice before you even take your first sip.

**A Little History That Made Me Appreciate It More**

I didn't realize until recently that matcha has been around for over 900 years. It started with Buddhist monks who used it for meditation because of its unique ability to create calm alertness. Unlike coffee, which can make you jittery, matcha contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation without drowsiness.

When you make matcha, you whisk the powder into hot water or milk. As a result, you actually consume the entire tea leaf when you drink it! That's why the health benefits are so concentrated compared to regular green tea where you just steep the leaves.

The traditional Japanese tea ceremony built around matcha emphasizes mindfulness and being present in the moment. I'm definitely not performing any ceremonies in my kitchen at 6:30 AM, but there's something about taking those few minutes to whisk mindfully that sets a completely different tone for my day.

**My Personal Matcha Journey (And Why I'm Never Going Back)**

I'll be real with you – the first week was an adjustment. My body was so used to that coffee spike and crash cycle that the steady, sustained energy from matcha felt almost... boring? But by week two, I realized I wasn't reaching for that 3 PM snack anymore. I wasn't getting those afternoon energy crashes that used to make me want to crawl under my desk.

The health benefits started showing up in ways I didn't expect. Antioxidants in green teas, such as matcha, protect your cells against damage from free radicals. This can help lower inflammation and prevent some chronic health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. I've noticed my skin looks clearer, and I swear my focus during work calls has improved dramatically.

**Why I'm Obsessed With How To Prepare Matcha Tea – Easy & Delicious Beginner's Guide**

What I love about following a solid **How To Prepare Matcha Tea – Easy & Delicious Beginner's Guide** is that it takes the guesswork out of everything. Water temperature, ratios, whisking technique – having a reliable method means you get consistent results every time.

My current routine is stupidly simple: 1 teaspoon of sifted ceremonial-grade matcha, 2 ounces of 175°F water, whisk until frothy, then add 6 ounces of warm oat milk. Takes maybe 5 minutes total, and I get this creamy, naturally sweet latte that keeps me energized until lunch.

**The Bottom Line**

Full of antioxidants and other healthful compounds, matcha powder —is a finely powdered, high-quality type of green tea that acts as 1) an energizer 2) A natural aphrodisiac 3) Combats anxiety and depression 4) Supports hormonal balance 5) Increases short-term focus, and memory. But beyond all the health benefits, I genuinely look forward to making my matcha each morning now.

It's become this little ritual that grounds me before the day gets crazy. And honestly? I feel like I'm treating my body with more respect when I choose matcha over my old coffee habit.

If you're thinking about making the switch, start with a quality ceremonial-grade powder and don't skip the sifting step. Your taste buds will thank you, and your energy levels will be so much more stable throughout the day.

I stumbled across this combination completely by accident last month when I was cleaning out my pantry and found a tin of matcha powder I'd forgotten about. I had some fresh lemons sitting on my counter, and for some reason my brain just went ""what if?"" To be honest, I didn't expect much – I thought it would be too weird or clash completely.

👉 *Learn the full recipe and technique that makes this drink absolutely perfect*

**Why Quality Matcha Actually Matters**

Here's what I learned the hard way: not all matcha is created equal, especially for drinks like **Matcha Tea Lemonade: The Coolest Drink You'll Savor This Summer**. I initially tried this with some cheap matcha I grabbed from the grocery store, and it was... not great. Bitter, chalky, and honestly kind of gross mixed with lemon.

The game-changer was investing in ceremonial-grade matcha. Yes, it costs more upfront, but the difference is night and day. Good matcha has this smooth, almost creamy quality that doesn't fight with the lemon – instead, they complement each other perfectly. The vegetal notes of the matcha actually enhance the brightness of the lemon rather than competing with it.

**The Secret to Perfect Texture**

*This is where most people mess up*, and I definitely did at first. You can't just dump matcha powder directly into cold lemonade and expect it to work. The key is creating what I call a ""matcha base"" first.

I whisk the matcha with a tiny bit of hot water (not boiling – that'll make it bitter) until it's completely smooth. This creates a concentrated paste that dissolves beautifully when you add it to cold ingredients. The texture should be silky, not gritty. If you're getting clumps, you're either using water that's too hot or not whisking enough.

**A Little History That Blew My Mind**

I went down a rabbit hole researching this drink because I was convinced I'd invented something revolutionary. Turns out, matcha lemonade has actually been around for decades in Japan, where they call it ""matcha lemon."" It gained popularity in Japanese cafes in the 1980s as a summer cooling drink.

The Arnold Palmer connection is interesting too – this drink is basically a green tea version of that classic half-tea, half-lemonade combination. What's cool is that matcha's slightly bitter, earthy flavor balances the sweet-tart lemonade in a way that regular green tea just can't match.

**My Personal Matcha Lemonade Journey**

I have to confess something: I used to be a matcha skeptic. I'd tried it in overpriced coffee shop lattes and always thought it tasted like grass. But making **Matcha Tea Lemonade: The Coolest Drink You'll Savor This Summer** at home completely changed my perspective.

The first time I nailed the recipe, I was sitting on my back porch during a heat wave, and this drink literally felt like a cool, refreshing hug. It has this unique quality where it's energizing but not jittery like coffee, and the lemon makes it so bright and refreshing.

Now I make a big batch every Sunday and keep it in the fridge. My husband was skeptical at first (he's more of a beer-on-the-porch guy), but even he's converted. My sister came over last week and demanded the recipe immediately.

**What Makes This Drink Special**

Beyond just tasting incredible, **Matcha Tea Lemonade: The Coolest Drink You'll Savor This Summer** hits different than other summer drinks. The matcha gives you this gentle, sustained energy without the crash. The antioxidants don't hurt either – I like knowing I'm getting some health benefits along with my refreshment.

It's also incredibly versatile. Sometimes I add a splash of sparkling water for fizz, or a tiny bit of honey when I want it sweeter. On really hot days, I'll make it extra strong and pour it over crushed ice.

**The Perfect Summer Ritual**

Making this drink has become my weekend ritual. There's something meditative about whisking the matcha, hearing the ice clink in the glass, and taking that first sip. It feels fancy enough for guests but simple enough for a random Tuesday afternoon.

I've served **Matcha Tea Lemonade: The Coolest Drink You'll Savor This Summer** at two different gatherings now, and people always ask for the recipe. It's become my signature drink, which honestly makes me feel pretty cool.

The best part? Unlike complicated cocktails or expensive cafe drinks, this is something you can actually make consistently at home. Once you get the technique down, it takes maybe three minutes to whisk up a glass.

1lrw0zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lrw0zr/she_had_a_boyfriend_i_was_married_we_never/,"She had a boyfriend. I was married. We never crossed the line, but I can’t get her out of my head years later.","What should I do at this point? Confront her and tell her the truth on how I feel? Keep things as they are and work on making the feelings to fade away? Set boundaries and make the friendship die slowly?

4 years ago, I (29m now) was married and she (28f now)(Ashley) was in a committed relationship. We met at work and clicked. We joke around a lot and have grown closer, enjoying each other’s company (or so I think). She sometimes makes it an effort to come sit with me or talk to me. Mostly I would be the one to initiate these things, but so would she. We were a group of 3: me, her, and this girl (Riley). Sometimes we would hang out after work for dinner, movies, escape rooms, etc. When talking to her, I’d always tease her and make fun of her (in a friendly way) and she would always laugh. The majority of our “friendship” was me making her laugh, leading/supporting her work, and giving her advice when she needed it. She grew closer to me and gave me compliments on my leadership skills and handling pressure multiple times.

Once we were working on a project for 2 months together. I was the lead on it, but we worked closely together. We worked weekends and averaged 12–16 hours daily. Our plan for the entire team was to meet at our office at 9am for work until 2pm, then go to the client’s office until we finish, sometimes 2–4am. Her house was closer to the client’s office, but she always carpooled with me and I dropped her back to the office at night, even when it was easier for her to just go to the client’s office and drive home after. When she would finish work at 7pm, she’d stay until I left to help or talk. Once we ended going back to the office at 3am and she was being a bit flirty (I didn’t notice it at the time).

Another time she was going to travel for a project and was a bit insistent indirectly that I go with her to help out. I did, but nothing significant happened. She dressed differently, wearing a white crop top and asking personal questions. I missed the mark here too on opening up.

In between all of this and on a few short occasions, she would tell me how her BF doesn’t give her enough attention, doesn’t hang out with her as much outside of their friend group. How sometimes he is hanging out with mutual friends and they’re playing a game, and she’ll call saying she’ll come hang out and he’ll tell her not to come because they are so focused on the game. I asked her once how they met and got together, she was vague but said her entire friend group met at university and he liked her a lot. He either asked her out and she said no or he told them and they all “convinced” her to give him a chance because he is kind and comes from a good family, etc. (She is wealthy, and so is he but not on her level.)

We both ended up leaving the company, but she left first and came back to visit once, wearing makeup, her hair done (on Valentine’s Day. Note, I’m still married and she has a long-term partner). When I saw her, we hugged, but the hug was very tight, her hands over my shoulder, and it was a long hug. We hugged for almost 10 seconds. Then we went to the company’s lounge and on the couch we all played this trivia game with the team. I said a joke and she got up laughing and then touched my hand.

I left the company, and went cold on communication for a bit, but she kept messaging me job links (she didn’t know I found another job). We ended up going out like 2 months later, the 3 of us, and continued to try to see each other multiple times as a group. Sometimes I’d try to invite her out alone, but she would raincheck and never reschedule—even when I say “yeah we can raincheck, but it’s on you to reschedule.” Anyway, she would respond to my IG stories teasing and what not, being friendly or laughing at the funny videos I post. Until this day.

I noticed that for birthdays, she wouldn’t put in effort in planning. When we did Riley’s bday twice, I did all the planning. When Riley did mine, Riley did all the planning. No effort from Ashley’s side. For my birthday I got an action figure of a character I liked (Riley picked it out) and Ashley got me a carry-on bag because I started a new job working for an airline and would travel a lot. For Ashley’s birthday—the first one after we all left—I gave her a bunch of gifts, and then I gave her a personalized letter telling her how great of a friend she was (it was lowkey a love letter, but phrased completely like “you’re a great friend blah blah”). She took it, read it, closed it and put it in her bag without saying anything at all. After that, I stopped engaging much with her. Only texted her to plan Riley’s birthday and did it.

Fast forward to her second birthday, I planned everything again. Because Riley’s birthday is exactly a month after Ashley’s—and I know Ashley never plans anything—I planned it anyway. After we did Ashley’s birthday and Riley left dinner early, Ashley asked me what should we do? I told her I already planned it and bought these gifts if you’d like to contribute. She suggested an additional gift she could buy, I said okay and to just text me when everything arrives. She never did, and we never did Riley’s birthday. I ended up doing it alone without inviting her. My birthday came around and she never wished me a happy birthday.

Once Ashley and I went out for dinner, very intimate sushi place. We stayed there for 4+ hours just talking—mostly her talking and me listening. She showed me pictures of her growing up, a new brand and business she is working on, and the story of how she found this company that built her brand for her. She was proud of it and I was listening to her very attentively. She was enjoying it a lot.

I got divorced, and when we went out for dinner the 3 of us, I told them. Riley was empathetic, saying nice things. Ashley didn’t say much. Not much of a reaction from her. Riley said “I’m here if you need anything blah blah,” Ashley just said “yeahh we’re here.”

Now, she messaged me asking if I knew anyone open to working with her at her dad’s company for a director position. I was looking for another opportunity so I accepted it, and we work together—she is technically my boss.

Typically I go to her office to chat, listen to her when she wants to speak or vent, or talk about her other business/passion project and I’m always an active listener. I didn’t feel the same level of effort from her, but she always accepts my compliments, mildly flirty comments, etc. Sometimes she would tease back. Sometimes we step out for coffee and she started telling me personal things: her life story, her parents, her dad and how he was sometimes hard on her, how she didn’t grow up in a very emotionally open/safe home, etc. She would sometimes mention how her BF won’t reassure her on marriage and how he won’t propose because he wants to achieve certain goals first. She opened this topic a few times, but I didn’t indulge it too much because it makes me uncomfortable. I tried to stay neutral and tell her maybe he wants to be ready financially, emotionally and physically to be responsible for a woman.

Another time we went out for breakfast during work with the entire team. We played a card game (Getting Closer: Team Edition) and a question came up: “what do you admire most about your colleagues?” Each person answered for each team member. Everyone on my team said amazing things about me like how I’m very emotionally and socially intelligent, kind, gentle, genuine. She also said the same things. The conversation turned into each person sharing a story on the kindest/most empathetic thing I’ve done for them. When we went back, she was around me most of the day. We then had a corporate event that night.

Once we were invited to a corporate event at night. Kind of like a gala but not too fancy. I offered to pick her up from home, go to the event, and drop her home and she obliged. She came drenched in perfume. We drove to the event joking a lot and laughing, enjoying music. At one point when we were laughing, we were pushing each other’s arms while laughing because it was funny. We go to the event, finish, then while we are waiting for the valet, she mentioned her BFF is getting engaged. I told her hope you’re next, she said “yeah I keep sending him pictures of rings and he only reacts with emojis of laughing. He doesn’t tell me. He promised by EOY but I don’t even know when. Just give me a timeline.” We get in the car then I suggest we order in and I can show her my place. She agreed as long as I drop her home after. We went back, I showed her my place, and stayed from 10:30pm to 1am at my apartment just chatting. I listened to her childhood and I joked around a lot and she laughed. I dropped her home after that. Next day her and the entire team is in my office for 1 hour eating lunch and working. She was looking at me frequently even though I’m not talking to her and she’s not really part of the work conversation.

Now I’m pulling back a bit because I feel like I’m leading this “friendship”—taking initiative, trying to talk, asking about her—but not getting the same back. For about a week, I stopped engaging, only go to her for work, and message her only about work. Note, the group of me, her and Riley has been dead for months—maybe 8–10 months. She is now sending old memories (she did this twice) in the group chat and also reels on our IG chat. She knows I like (as a friend) one of her friends Duna (I met her once, but heard great things about her from Ashley). She used to tell me sometimes “yeah we can hang out together, I’ll invite you next time” or whatever, but never does. She randomly texts me during the week I wasn’t speaking to her saying “her friend Duna had a few questions about subject (I’m an expert in) and I gave her your number if that’s okay?” I said sure, send her my way. It was odd and random.

She came to my office yesterday before heading home after me not talking to her for a while. We spoke a bit and she started telling me things like “I have an appointment at the doctor’s for blah blah,” “I started a tennis class.” I was a bit engaging, but the vibe was obviously off. When she got up to leave, we joked very lightly (she hates it when people misspell her name), so I threw in a joke about her name to tease and she laughed and gave me a look before leaving. But I know she felt something off.

Now I am trying to stay away from her because of how I feel and only talk about work, but it’s difficult. She noticed me pulling away and coming back when it gets too hard.",1,1751670820.0,Advice,0,0.67,False

I'm from the Netherlands, I've been to Bosnia many times and I love the country, the people, the culture, the food, you name it. Unfortunately I won't be able to stay in Bosnia for my vacation this summer. Later this month I will be in Trogir, Croatia for 2 days though... And I really want to make a quick (half) day trip to Bosnia to at least buy some of my favorites things from the grocery store/markets, have a coffee and obviously eat some Ćevapi. 
What would be the best place for me to cross the border into Bosnia? I've heard that Neum would be the easiest/least busy border, is this true, would there be better options? Usually I'd enter Bosnia in Slavonski Brod or Gradiška, so I'm a bit unfamiliar now. 

I'd really appreciate any advice!! 
Thank you",2,1751670799.0,bosnia,0,1.0,False

I've been coming to terms with it over the last few weeks, but this week she's been completely stonewalling me, and it hurts a lot. I know it's not about me. I know she's showing me her true character, and it's incompatible with my values and needs. I know she's not going to change and I need space from her to heal. But I don't have space yet, and it's been crushing sitting in our house today while she's at work, on a holiday, and didn't say anything to me when she left the house.

So now it's the afternoon, and our daughter is at Grandma's, and my WW is at work, and I don't know what to do with myself to feel better. I hate sitting in this house with all of the pictures of us and the reminders of her abuse and my isolation. I went for a walk and called my dad. I texted with my brother. I went to a coffee shop and googled lawyers. And now I just want to leave the house again. But it's the 4th of July, things are closed, people have plans, and I don't want to wander around aimlessly.

But I don't want to be home. I can't focus on hobbies. I don't want to do chores. I've been working out hard the last few days and my body needs a break. I'm not hungry (although I should probably eat). I don't want to spend money because I'm anxious about what ending this marriage will cost. I've read. I've listened to music. I've gone for a walk and talked to myself.

I guess I just want to feel less alone, and I'm really anxious about how I'll feel when my WW eventually comes home. Yesterday I left the house first, and I was feeling proud of myself for prioritizing myself while also taking the high road (I said goodbye before I left). I went to get some coffee, and when I got to my office afterwards I noticed the barista had written ""Hey ♥️"" on my cup instead of my name. I have no interest in that kind of connection with others right now, but it was really nice to be reminded that I have value and I'm desirable. This narrative that something is wrong with me is total bullshit, and this isolation my wife has always coerced me into makes it so easy to forget my worth and believe her narrative.

Fuck these affairs, sure. But more maybe more importantly, fuck this abuse. I'm going to find some food and walk through the park where people are celebrating together. Maybe there'll be something nice to eat.",6,1751670742.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,4,0.88,False

I don’t always have the right words when it comes to saying thank you.
Funny, considering I write for a living, or something close to it.
But this part? The part where I sit back and try to put into words what your support means to me?
It’s not easy.

Because this.. what I’m building here, isn’t just content.
It’s not polished essays or packaged inspiration.
It’s pieces of me.
Pages ripped out of my past, present, and maybe some future I’m still learning how to walk toward.

Every single time someone chooses to support my work,
leave a tip,
commission a letter,
or just quietly read something I put into the world...
you’re helping me more than you probably realize.

This is therapy for me, in a way.
A release valve.
A place where I can tell the truth,
even if it’s through metaphor and shadow.
Even if the names are left out.
Even if the wounds are still healing.

It means the world to know there are people who believe in this.
Who believe in me.
enough to throw a few bucks my way to keep me caffeinated and typing.
To keep this strange little lighthouse lit.
So others can find their way, too.

To those of you who’ve asked for commissioned letters  to say what you couldn’t say out loud,
or to finally put something to rest
thank you for trusting me.
That’s not lost on me.
Not for a second.

To those who quietly tip without asking for anything in return..
I see you.
I feel the love.
It lands.

And to those who just read,
silently, consistently, you matter, too.
This place wouldn’t exist without you.

Maybe someday I’ll be a real author.
Maybe one day these words will live in books or on shelves or in someone’s hands.
But even if that never happens,
I’m grateful to be writing now.
To be read now.
To be seen, by you.

Thank you.

Seriously.

~Me

and your kindness in the other)

1lrvwzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1lrvwzm/realizing_your_parents_werent_good_parents_as_an/,Realizing your parents weren't good parents as an adult,"Throwaway obviously.

Hey everyone, I was hoping for some advice. In the last few days, I've had a horrifying realization that I've been excusing my parents actions in my head and blaming myself for my childhood. 

It came around the other day when I (19f) met with my mum for coffee and explained that I didnt want to see my brother (21m) anymore. Throughout my childhood he was physically abusive to me and was the root cause behind my suicide attempts and eating disorder. He was and still is my biggest bully. 

I had gone over for dinner the other weekend without my boyfriend and my brother and parents were there, during the night, my brother called me fat, insulted my appearance, and overall disrespected me. 

I explained to my mum that as an adult, I will not be treated that way, and if someone else in my life did that, I'd cut them off straight away. When I told her this, she went straight to excusing his behavior and telling me how hard his life is right now and that I need to be the bigger person. 

After coffee, when I was with my bf, I broke down as I realised that was my tipping point. We've been together for 3 years and I haven't told him much about my experience growing up but when I started rehashing moments in my life when my brother would beat me and threaten me with knives/talking about wanting to kill me, and how every time my parents would tell me off for provoking him and that I need to be nicer. He was shocked to say the least, and that's when it finally clicked that how I grew up wasnt normal and I still hold a lot of trauma from it. 

Even when we first started dating, he hated coming over to my house and said that it wasn't alright that my parents would yell at me when I was apologizing and just wanting to leave. (I just said that we are loud people lol) I figured he was just trying to support me and that I was still in the wrong about that, but I would and have never screamed at my bf as I think that's incredibly inappropriate, which came to another realization that how my parents spoke to me when I lived at home was horrible. 

I'm a people pleaser and always apologize and think its my fault when something bad happens to me. I've always said my parents are amazing and it wasnt their fault that I ended up with so many mental health issues, but I've realised now that if I was a parent and I saw what my son was doing, I would never react how they did. 

Over the last few years I have tried to help my brother as much as possible, with admin work such as applying for his passport and finding a flat, to support with general life happenings. All while he would be putting me down and being horrible to me, and I just accepted it as my duty and that I need to be the bigger person. 

Even now whenever I bring hard things from my childhood up, my parents tell me it never happened and that I'm being overdramatic. Such as my mum saying she wished she could cheat weight loss like I did and stick her fingers down her throat or when she broke down to me at 14 and said that she didnt think my dad loved her anymore and that they hadn't had sex in a long time and she was struggling. 

I'm just seeking advice on how to navigate this, as I'm really struggling mentally as my parents were my idols growing up and I just dont know what to do. I still love them so much and definitely dont want to cut them off, but I'm finding it difficult to talk to them at the moment and just want it to all go away.

1lrvszc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NomadicLifestyleGlobe/comments/1lrvszc/nomadic_lifestyle_benefits_unlocking_freedom/,"Nomadic Lifestyle Benefits: Unlocking Freedom, Growth & Adventure","Routine is a velvet prison. It lulls, it numbs, it suffocates. The nomadic lifestyle? It’s the jailbreak. You toss the calendar, torch the commute, and sidestep the life script written by someone else. Suddenly, every day is a blank page. You are the author, the rebel, the architect of your own existence.

**The Allure of the Unmapped Path**  
Predictability is overrated. The unmapped path is where magic happens. Nomads crave the unknown, savoring the thrill of not knowing what’s around the corner. It’s not just travel; it’s a declaration of independence from the ordinary.

***🚀 Curious about your own nomadic potential? [Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in Under 90 Seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

### Freedom Unleashed

**Geographic Independence: Your Office, Your Rules**  
Forget the cubicle. Your workspace is wherever the Wi-Fi hums—beach, mountain, city café. No boss breathing down your neck. No fluorescent lights. Just you, your laptop, and a world that bends to your whim.

**Time Autonomy: Designing Your Own Clock**  
Alarm clocks are relics. You work when you want, nap when you need, and chase sunsets on your lunch break. Time becomes elastic, molded to your priorities, not the other way around.

***🌍 Ready to break free? [Find out if you’re cut out for the digital nomad life in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

### Financial Flexibility

**Cost Arbitrage: Earning in Dollars, Spending in Pesos**  
Geoarbitrage is the secret weapon. Earn in strong currencies, spend in affordable paradises. Your money stretches further, buying you more life, less stress.

**Minimalism: Wealth Without the Weight**  
Stuff is an anchor. Nomads travel light, investing in experiences, not possessions. Minimalism isn’t sacrifice—it’s liberation. Every item you own is a choice, not a chain.

### Personal Growth on the Move

**Adaptability: The Survival Skill No One Teaches**  
When plans combust and buses vanish, you improvise. Adaptability becomes second nature. It’s evolution in real time—sink or swim, and nomads always swim.

Lost in translation? Good. Every awkward encounter is a confidence upgrade. You learn to trust yourself, to navigate chaos with a grin, to thrive where others hesitate.

### Health and Wellbeing

Movement is medicine. Nomads walk, hike, swim, dance. The world is a gym, and the routine is anything but sedentary.

**Mindfulness in Motion**  
Travel demands presence. You become hyper-aware—of flavors, faces, feelings. Mindfulness isn’t a practice; it’s a necessity.

**Sidestepping Bureaucracy**  
You dodge red tape like a pro. Visas, taxes, paperwork—handled on your terms, not theirs. The system can’t pin you down.

### Redefining Community

**Finding Your People, Everywhere**  
Community isn’t a postcode. It’s a WhatsApp group, a coworking desk, a shared meal. You belong everywhere.

**Virtual Networks, Real Support**  
Your support system is global. Help is a DM away, advice a video call away.

***🚀 Want a global community? [Diagnose your nomad income potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

1lrvsg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/1lrvsg6/intp_enfp_istp_what_is_even_my_type/,INTP? ENFP? ISTP? What is even my type?,"I'm so confused about what functions I use. I've read several descriptions of the cognitive functions but I can't seem to figure out what *I* use.

Still, as far as I know, I use the following functions: Ti, Fe, Ni and Se. 

**Why do I think I use Ti?**
Because from what I've read, *Te* is a function that mostly follows the trends or what people around them are doing. If a friend tells them that breathing the fresh air from the balcony first thing in the morning has the same effect as a cup of coffee, they'll do it. 

If a friend tells me that, I would ask “Why?” and then try to do my research on why she said so. Does the fresh air triggers the same response in our body as coffee does? I'll search it on Google and research for at least 20 minutes. There's still no guarantee that I'll try it out even once. I don't drink coffee anyways. It's smell is too strong.

**Fe:**
I read somewhere that when a car breaks down, Fe users look for the people around them and see how they're reacting, and focus more on comforting or distracting them from the inconvenience than focusing on feeling their own possible frustration; while a Fi user would kick the car and express their frustration.

I feel for Fe, not only in this example but in the descriptions of how Fe works as well! I'm very aware of people's emotions as well. Just yesterday, my friend was feeling cold and I asked her if she wanted me to warm her hands. I asked that because I couldn't ignore her discomfort anymore. It made me feel bad. 

Also, whenever a fight happens at home, I feel like I've absorbed all the bad energy because my mood and energy just drains out immediately, even if I wasn't involved in the fight in any way!


**Ni:**
This is what I'm the most confused about: Ni or Ne? I think a lot; like a lot. Just yesterday during Physics class, I was thinking of how I haven't prepared for the upcoming test, then I noticed someone peeking inside the class through the door and I started wondering what the person wanted, then I thought about if the teachers prepare the learning material themselves or someone else does it? How can they improve their teaching methods and what not.

A glimpse in my mind: I saw the painted walls while passing through an underpass while in car, and I thought “do they bring a scale for measuring while painting the walls? The flowers seem to be at the exact same height..
Then I saw a man on a motorbike, and I started wondering how the engines are made, what should I do if the bike suddenly started burning? Should I go and save the person? Can I even do that since the car is moving on a highway now? Oh. We're already on the highway? I wonder how they make the roads, how they plan and connect them?

Whatever my thinking function is, I believe it is very strong. I don't think I use Ne, because I don't like the abstract. I only think like this for practical, real world things. 


**Lastly, Se:**
I'm not obsessed about the past. I think so much more about the future than the past, so I assume I don't use Si. I also don't store information in a linear manner, nor am I super aware of my internal body sensations. I feel them, of course, but I don't remember things in form of how I physically felt at that moment. 

I remember the outerworld things. Like the expression a person made, what I said to them, what year the event happened and what I had been doing before or during that time etc. 
I'm extremely aware of my physical environment. A movement in the corner of my eye has me snapping my head towards that direction. I always have my mind on the present moment while I'm out. I only think about the future when I'm not being fed physical stimuli, which is why I love being outside because it makes me not think about the scary future. 
I also notice things easily. My distant relatives had their sofa right below the TV (for some reason) when we last visited, and 2 years later when we visited again, the first thing I noticed was exactly that. My friend usually wears a pink claw clip, but a few days she wore a blue one and I noticed it immediately. “Oh, you wore a blue one today?”
I also have good memory.

Having said that, I would like to make it clear that I'm a scaredy cat, I would rather eat my least favorite food than try an amusement park ride. Both are bad, but at least eating that God awful dish won't k!ll me. 


That's all I can think of at that moment. I've been trying to type myself for *months* but it wasn't working so I finally decided to make a post here. I've made another a few weeks ago, please do check it out if you have time because I've answered a few questions on there.

1lrvrak,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyCruiser/comments/1lrvrak/sidebyside_vs_tandem_strollers_which_one_is_right/,Side-by-Side vs. Tandem Strollers: Which One is Right for You?,"As parents juggling little ones (and preparing for another!), we know how crucial it is to have a stroller that actually makes life *easier*. When you have two kids who need a ride, choosing between a side-by-side and a tandem stroller can feel overwhelming.

At BabyCruiser, we understand this challenge, which is why we designed a [double stroller](https://thebabycruiser.com/p/double-stroller-for-siblings/) that gives you the best of both worlds—functionality, comfort, and easy maneuverability. But before we dive into why our stroller stands out, let’s break down the pros and cons of both side-by-side and tandem models so you can make the best choice for your family.

# Side-by-Side Strollers

A side-by-side stroller has two seats positioned next to each other, meaning both kids get an equal view of the world.

Pros of Side-by-Side Strollers:

✅ Better for Sibling Interaction – Your little ones can see and talk to each other, making the ride more enjoyable.  
✅ Equal Comfort for Both Kids – Both seats usually recline the same way and have the same features, so no one gets the “bad seat.”  
✅ Smooth & Stable Ride – Side-by-side strollers often have larger wheels and better suspension, making them great for all terrains.  
✅ Easier to Push – Because the weight is evenly distributed, these strollers often feel less heavy and more balanced than tandem models.

Cons of Side-by-Side Strollers:

❌ Wider Than Tandem Strollers – Maneuvering through narrow doorways and crowded stores can be a challenge.  
❌ Takes Up More Space When Folded – If you have a small car, double-check the trunk space!  
❌ Not Always Ideal for Busy City Living – Tight sidewalks and crowded spaces can make side-by-side strollers frustrating to use.

Best for Families Who:

✔️ Walk a lot outdoors and need a smooth, easy push.  
✔️ Want equal seating for both kids.  
✔️ Don’t mind the extra width for a more balanced ride.

# Tandem Strollers

A tandem stroller (also called an inline stroller) seats one child in front of the other, making it narrower than a side-by-side.

Pros of Tandem Strollers:

✅ Fits Through Narrow Doors & Aisles – If you shop a lot in small boutiques or live in a crowded city, a tandem stroller makes navigation easier.  
✅ Usually More Compact When Folded – Easier to fit in smaller cars and storage spaces.  
✅ Expandable Options – Some tandems (like convertible strollers) allow for additional configurations, making them flexible for growing families.

Cons of Tandem Strollers:

❌ Harder to Steer – With one seat in front of the other, the weight isn’t as evenly distributed, making turns more difficult.  
❌ Less Interaction for Kids – The child in the back may not have a great view, which can lead to boredom or sibling complaints.  
❌ Not Always Equal Seating – Some tandem strollers have different recline options, footrests, or sunshades, leading to the dreaded “I want THAT seat!” argument.

Best for Families Who:

✔️ Need a stroller that fits in tight spaces like city sidewalks and shopping aisles.  
✔️ Like the option of adding a second seat later (with a convertible tandem stroller).

# Why the BabyCruiser Double Stroller is the Perfect Choice!

At BabyCruiser, we know that no stroller is perfect—but we also know that parents deserve the best features in a single, well-designed stroller. That’s why we created the BabyCruiser [Double Stroller](https://thebabycruiser.com/p/double-stroller-for-siblings/), a hybrid design that blends the best aspects of both side-by-side and tandem strollers!

What Makes BabyCruiser Stand Out?

Slim Yet Spacious – Designed to **fit through standard doorways**, yet roomy enough for both kids to ride comfortably.  
Easy to Push & Maneuver – Unlike traditional tandem strollers, our design keeps the weight evenly balanced, **making steering a breeze**.  
**Full Reclining & Adjustable Seats** – No more seat envy! Both kids get equal comfort, whether sitting upright or napping.  
**Large Storage Basket** & Parent-Friendly Features – We know moms (and dads!) need easy access to diaper bags, snacks, and coffee.  
Compact Fold – **Fits into most car trunks** without the bulky struggle of traditional side-by-side models.

# Final Thoughts: Which Stroller is Right for You?

1. If you walk outdoors often and want the smoothest push → Side-by-side is a great choice.
2. If you live in a city and need to navigate tight spaces → A tandem stroller is a better fit.
