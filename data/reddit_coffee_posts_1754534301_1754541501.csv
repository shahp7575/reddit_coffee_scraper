1mjqoti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1mjqoti/blue_ghost_in_dunsborough/,Blue ghost in Dunsborough,"Hi all.

First time posting. Usually dont talk about this story often, however since discovering this page thought i'd share my experience.

Back in 2001-2002, i stayed as a young teen at a friends holiday home in Dunsborough, Western Australia with my family. Lovely place to holiday at. Holday house was the typical old stilted fishermans shack a few streets from a beach. Had an open plan kitchen and entertaining area (tv, couch, coffe table, dining table), 1 main bedroom internally, plus a sleep-out extension room externally attached capable of having 7 single beds in a row. Great for big families and wasnt always like this as the extension was built a few years prior (so not one of those old houses with history as an orphan houses or local hospitals).

My occurance goes as follows... 
First night on holidays at this place, i didnt want to sleep in the sleep-out area, as it wasnt accessable from the main house so being a new place, my 'stranger danger' senses thought sleeping on a couch inside was better suited safe with my parents no more than 5m away. It's late and everyone goes to bed around midnight. Being the typical kid i was, i took ages to go to sleep and layed on the couch looking towards the kitchen area hoping to fall asleep.

Heres where it gets crazy. I'm looking at the kitchen window (which is tiny used for just natural light) and out of nowhere this blue silhouette of a person climbs through the glass window, through the glass... then proceeds to climb down from the kitchen bench and slowly walks around the kitchen space looking at random things. Best way to explain the visual is a skinny person in a semi-translucent blue morph suit making no noise.

At this point i'm incredibly frozen and unable to move in fear, unable to speak or make any noise. the blue figure proceeds to walk around the house in what felt like 10 minutes looking at pictures, pots, and then makes its way over towards me laying on the couch. still completely frozen, i decided the best way to protect myself was to close my eyes partially and pretend to be asleep as to not draw attention. this seemed to work as the blue figure then spent the next minute squatting at the coffee table directly in front of me combing its hands through stacks of board games - only the board games did not move once. suddenly the blue figure then swivels towards me, proceeding to lean right into my face staring at me about 5cms away. it had no features, but lingered to the point i couldn't handle the looking anymore and shut my eyes completely. by this point my heart was in my mouth and decided to muster all my stength to yell put ""muuuuuuum!!!!"" in an effort to awaken them in the nearby room for help. It must have freaked the blue figure right out, as it then stood tall, and dashed towards the front door in rapid speed gliding across the floor. It then openned the inside door inwards (which was locked) and pushed the security screen door outwards in what seemed like instantly and simultaneously happening with a mighty banging noise.

My mum shortly follows this walking around the bedroom doorway asking ""what the matter was"" and questioned why i was openning the doors this late. i explained what i had witnessed and why the doors openned. My mum tried to reason with me that the wind caused the doors and it was nothing but i could see she was puzzled. Needless to say, i slept (if you could call it sleeping) in their room the remainder of the night.

I returned to this house again years later and never experienced anything like this again.

Blue figures appearing from what i gather seem to be rare, so i often wondered what it was and why this happened. I've never forgotten this moment but also like to think it was just a curious spirit although i've been told the paralysis was it feeding off my energy  but who knows...

Anyways, thats my experience 👍",1,1754541292.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

Anyways, as a very brief intro, I am going to be living part time (Mon-Thur) and working in Gangneung starting next month. I'll be living on the Gangneung Wonju National University (강릉원주대학교) campus. I'm guessing that I will be pretty busy, but not absolutely-no-time-to-relax busy, if you know what I mean.

My wife and I love Gangwon-do and have traveled there 3-4 times a year for the past decade or so. That makes me relatively knowledgeable about the surrounding area, but I've honestly only been to Gangneung a few times. I know a few good coffee shops and breweries (바드나무 is my favorite), but that's about it. I have already marked out a few good running paths and places to chill (Muscle Beach looks fun even if it is probably full of people), but likewise don't know all that much about where to workout. Granted, I guess I can just do the fitness center on campus, run around the track thing, but I enjoy running and walking around my area much more.

To anyone who is familiar with the city or lives there, mind sharing a few spots worth visiting, places to eat or drink, and/or good spots to work out? I will have a car, but am hoping to restrict myself to bicycle while there. However, I'm totally willing to bike long distances. Basically, anything within the city limits is fair game.

I am planning my graduation party which is happening pretty soon, but I'm in a bit of a tough position since I will be travelling until the day before the party and working with a tight budget (trying to keep food costs under $100). I will only have one day to prep all of the food and I'm really struggling to come up with a good menu.

There will be around 20-25 guests, and most everyone attending are Asian-American so I would like to have some traditional items. The theme of the party is pink and white, so plus points if the items fit the aesthetics!

This is the preliminary menu I came up with:

**Appetizers**

* Pre-marinated or frozen wings
* Hawaiian bread sliders
* Costco salad
* Chips & guac/salsa/hummus
* Shingara

**Entree (No pork and vegetarian options)**

* Make your own bibimbap station
* Pasta + garlic bread

**Dessert**

* Cake
* Brownies
* Fruits
* Falooda

**Drinks (No Alcohol)**

* Matcha and iced coffee stand
* Fruit punch
* Water

My biggest worry is what to serve as the main. I want to do something fun and that everyone would enjoy, but I won't have time to make a bunch of different banchan's for the bibimbap and buying them from H-mart or an equivalent store would be too expensive. I was also considering a make your own taco bowl or nachos station as well, but not a lot of us enjoy taco bowls. I though of a DIY pasta station as well but I'm worried guests may find it lackluster.

I look at Sigmund and he nods to serve them. They order the elaborate sandwich and pasta dishes, so we are scrambling to assemble them in time. I don’t know why Sigmund didn’t tell them we are closing.

The boomers get the food and they take their time. I politely tell them we are closing but they still sit there. This forces us to stay open until after 8:30.

Went away for the weekend. Hired a caregiver to cover. First day gone, caregiver gets the lift so stuck in the recliner during the transfer that eventually FD was called to untangle her. 

I walked caregiver through physical transfers before I left. Provided written instructions.

I only know about it because Mom mentioned handsome firefighters at the house and I checked video.

Do caregivers report to the family when something like this happens? 

I am sooooo disappointed in the caregiving I’ve been able to get for Mom. It’s feels very much like “do what you need to do to get her through the day” rather than follow simple directions I’ve provided to make her comfortable. 

Never ask questions. Just poorly improvise. 

Some can’t figure out that you need to add water to the coffee maker for it to work.

Both of us are single but inclined toward ENM. We went out for coffee fully knowning that our time in the same place would be limited and we ended up spending the whole day and night together. The connection we experienced was so thrilling. We talked about what happened when she returned home and both agreed that due to neither of us wanting a long distance relationship, we would be friends when in different places. And if we were in the same place, if we were willing and able, we could be friends with benefits.

We said goodbye to each other leaving the door open to me potentially visiting her. And as of this week, I'm going to do that! We're planning to spend three nights at this resort on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica that looks really cool. Late summer was basically our only realistic window to see each other again in the near future. We'll both be very busy with work in fall and winter. So we decided to go for it. We re-affirmed that our outlook on being FWBs when we can be in the same place, and just friends when we're not in the same place, remains the same.

I'm looking forward to this. I'm excited to see her, explore the coast together, have a lot of sex, and savor the moment of being able to experience life together. Having a fair amount of experience with ENM and FWBs, and having talked a lot about why this arrangement feels right to each of us, I feel confident that we can do this successfully. And at the same time, I've never gone on a vacation with a FWB before. I don't have any real reservations about it, in this instance. But I'm curious to know if anyone here has done this. If so, how did it go?",1,1754540348.0,nonmonogamy,1,1.0,False

Well this is it, the last day. Weigh in kind of sucks, been stuck at 193lb most of the week, I wonder if I keep going if I'll suddenly just drop another 2 pounds like I did from 195. I'll do another weigh in tomorrow and post each menu in order of my favorite to least and show how my body has changed in this time. I feel relatively healthy, definitely in need of some fresh food though, but tomorrow I'm going to order a pizza and enjoy some home cooking. Anyway one last menu, let's get into it...

Breakfast 7:30am: (7/10): apple pound cake with a coffee, not my favorite pound cake but I appreciate the variety, there are good nuggets of apple here and there and it has a rich apple smell, its just not the best flavour combo with coffee, prefer the vanilla, but its a decent thing to open first thing in the morning.

Lunch 12pm: (7/10): cobbler and teriyaki beef stick. This cobbler tastes a lot better than the first one I had and I can see why people like it, I enjoyed it too, just maybe not as much as some of you guys seem to. I think it would be better if it had a small cookie to crumble into it like yesterdays apple slices or some kind of trail mix to bash up and throw in there. The teriyaki beef stick is always a reliable component, I just wish they threw something else in here to amp up the cobbler. The cherries are great in this.

Dinner 5pm: (8/10): On to the main event... huge chunks of beef, lots of protein in here. The sauce is a rich beef/tomato, there's corn and plenty of black beans, I think it goes great with the the whole wheat tortillas, if I ate this in a diner somewhere I would not complain... well maybe about the portion size but otherwise this rocks. It can only be improved by a jalapeno cheese spread and a tabasco sauce, then we would have a 9.

Overall Score: 7.75/10: The main is up there with BBQ beef, chilli mac and maple sausage for me, Its just a lemonade or a pack of m&ms short of an 8 overall, either way I'm happy to end on a great menu, I would recommend trying this if you haven't already. Like I said before  I'll do another weigh in, hopefully after a BM tomorrow and that will be that. Thank you for following along, take care of yourselves!",1,1754540329.0,MRE,0,0.99,False

This one has a backstory: We met in a really strange way a little more than a year ago. In our freshman year of university, we had a few classes together (but they were hugeeee lectures, so we never talked). However, in sophomore year, our college set up this weird “marriage pact” quiz that would set you up with someone in the school. Another friend convinced me to do it (halfway as a joke), and it set me up with...him. The quiz sent both of us the name and email of our match, and I was honestly going to leave it there. But then he emailed me, and we ended up hitting it off.

That's how we met...and I think it affected how we perceived our friendship in many ways. After an initial coffee date or two (never kissed or anything like that), we hung out through the whole Spring semester. We texted every day; our conversations looked like essays, as we both took to typing out these long paragraphs to each other all day. I went into the whole thing with cautious optimism--if it develops into something, then cool! If not, no hard feelings. But if I'm going to be honest, I fell completely head over heels for him--but I'm not the type to confess (creating many life regrets), so I never said anything, and hoped it would just sprout naturally.

But...right when the Summer started, he stopped texting. It was like night and day. We went from daily, long, detailed conversations to nothing. We met up one last time in late June after a month of silence, and it was like nothing changed. We talked in the parking lot until 3am. It was so natural. But after that night last year, we didn't talk for months.

The last time we talked was at my art show last October (and the whole time I was beet red because I stg the exhibition space had NO AC!!! and I also gave myself a really bad haircut the night before (embarrassing event all around)). We were both there with our own friend groups, so our interactions were short and awkward. Since then, we just walk past each other on campus, and neither of us says anything. No wave, no eye contact, nothing.

Which is completely fine! He doesn't owe me anything (friendship or otherwise), and people naturally drift apart. But I'm entering my senior year in university now, and I dunno...I want to make the best of it before I leave. I think by now, I'm over my crush, and I've realized that I mainly miss our friendship. Our conversations flowed smoothly, and we had a lot of interests in common. We never discussed taking it further (and we never interacted in a way beyond friendship)--so there is no baggage there.

So, here's the question: Is it weird and strange to reach out and ask to be friends again? Is that too direct? I was considering being completely open, and owning up to crushing on him, but emphasizing that I no longer feel that way and want to be friends again (but I feel like that is weird too...). I feel like I am definitely overthinking things right now...and I am too embarassed to get advice from my friends, so I'm asking the internet. Am I being freakish and strange?

It ended with her (or chatgpt) saying DON'T EVER REACH OUT TO ME EVER AGAIN!...I sent a goodbye message, and then she had to one up me and say goodbye..... Strange.

Well anyways, we met up again. She cried some more but told me she has so much resentment and that I need to take accountability. She kissed me. Said she loved me. Then 15 minutes later sent me an email saying.... ""I'm afraid to tell you everything inside me and it's not fair to you. So I'll have to be brave......""

AND THAT WAS IT! NEVER ANYTHING MORE. No other message. No other email. Silence. What the heck. ????",1,1754539730.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

I looked around, realizing I wasn't rushing off to some urgent task or scrolling throgh my phone. It was just me, my coffee, and the sun peeming through the blinds. I dunno, thede was something grounding about it... like, appreciating the present doesn't alwats have to be this grsnd act. It's more about these tiny, quiet momments that remind us to breathe and just exist.

Husband of 6 years has had mental health challenges for a long time. Unclear what, he won't get evaluated because he thinks if he gets diagnosed it'll ruin his life... two therapists I've seen personally said he sounds like he has narcissistic traits, I can see why they think that but in my uneducated opinion I'd guess paranoid personality disorder but idk. He seems to have some OCD traits, he thinks everything has mold and will make him sick, tap water isn't safe to drink, he thought our son could still get SIDS at 1.5 and freaked out about his sleeping position, he thinks everything is going to destroy the finish on the floor. Whatever it is it got way worse after we had kids.

He thinks everybody's out to get him including me no matter how much I try to reassure him.  90% of our fights are him accusing me of having bad motives. I keep thinking wow, if the version of me that lives in his head was real I'd be an awful human being. Honestly it really hurts because I try really, really hard

Was I stupid for just assuming this would improve and didn't do anything when I saw the signs early on and ✨love✨ would be enough? You bet I was

He saw a therapist for a few months last year but he stopped because he didn't think he needed to anymore. He masks well and I don't think he was completely honest with him.

He likes to make my alleged postpartum depression the problem. I even got a therapist because he told me I needed help and she told me any depressive symptoms I have are ""environmental."" I honestly think the main issue is burnout from being basically abandoned postpartum and pretty much solely responsible for a baby and a toddler since birth.

And... if I wasn't bending over backwards to make it happen I'm pretty sure we'd just be celibate. It's less than once a month. We've had sex 3 times in 2025. Even when we were apart for a month and he visited for a weekend he wasn't interested and it didn't happen. There's always an excuse.

He especially likes to ruin nights it could possibly happen by picking fights and running off to sulk.

When a nurse asked me about birth control postpartum his answer was ""abstinence."" She laughed like oh yeah it's hard with a new baby. Nope. It's always like this.

Now he's saying he needs to feel more special. That he wants me to want him for *him* and not just because he's my husband and he's interchangeable with any guy I was married to. I was like *what.* But I knew it was futile to argue with him.

I'm trying really hard to do what he says he wants to make him more interested in sex. I feel like the goalposts keep moving. At first it was ""I need to go on a date first"" but then he never made plans and avoided my ""flirty-but-hopefully-not-too-desperate"" attempts to drag him out for coffee or ice cream like I was asking him to get a root canal.

So right now we're doing this marriage exercise to build emotional intimacy where you don't have sex for two weeks (check) and spend the first week talking uninterrupted for 10-20 minutes a night, then the second week talking while giving a massage, then the third week you talk about desired frequency and try to come to an agreement about meeting each other's needs.

I'm 100% expecting this to fail because I've had to ""remind"" him to even talk to me for 10 minutes at the end of the day multiple times. We're supposed to be moving into week 2 tomorrow. Wish me luck I guess ",1,1754539625.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

At the time i felt like he was too controlling and possessive, he wanted to call every night and i wanted to settle in to my life half way across the country.

Now we’re graduated, I’m back home, and i miss him. I think i kept myself distracted throughout those last two years of college - with school, work, and summer research projects, i didn’t have time to process the breakup. Now i’m home with a job and time to reflect on everything, and i honestly have a lot of regrets about the way i handled everything and not appreciating what we had. 

I dream about him all the time. In these dreams i always try to seek him out to talk to him. 

A few weeks ago after one of these dreams i texted to see if he wanted to grab lunch. He told me he’s working in another state for the next year. Soon after i saw a story post of him and someone else for national girlfriends day. I know it’s been two years but i was really sad to see that. 

I wish i did so many things differently. I know so much time has passed and he’s probably so different now but i can’t help but reminisce. I know i just need to move on but it feels so hard, i feel like i threw something away that could’ve been so good if i just stuck out the uncomfortable parts. 

The worst part is, i know he would’ve taken me back if i had this realization sooner, for months after our breakup he reached out and we went out for coffee etc. 

I guess im asking for advice. I never told him any of this - how sorry i truly am, and i doubt he wants to hear it now that he has moved on, i don’t want to complicate his life or mess with his feelings. Do i just go about my life and try to forget? I’ll take the lessons learned from this experience with me of course, but i really wish i could have a do-over with him, and if he ever is single again, i’ll be here.

Long post, but looking for the real deal

After reading some passionate and vulnerable posts I figured I would put myself out there as well.

I am first and foremost a nurturer and caretaker at heart. I have for the longest time wanted to put together the nuclear family for myself. I love being a woman and know my place in supporting the right and deserving man. I often day dream of the day where everyday is serving my husband coffee or tea just how he likes it and trying the next recipe and determining if it’s good enough to make it into the family cookbook. I would never let a day go by without making sure you know how much I appreciate the life you provide for us. Making sure you feel satisfied and keeping you strong and happy would be my upmost priority. I want both of our cups overflowing as much as possible.

My friends and family would describe me as down to earth, kind, a good listener, and reliable. I have never been one for material things or center of attention energy. I have never cared to be the loudest or hottest in any room. I value experiences like travel and creating a calm and peaceful home above all else. I love nature, yoga, gym, reading, making art, baking/cooking, music, concerts, festivals, and PLANTS. I enthuse about new board games and will always be down for a nice card game. I’m educated I have had several different types of jobs and just love learning. I enjoy a good conspiracy theory and just keeping an open mind about all different types of conversation. I’m fiery in all the right ways, but equally a comforting flame. I’m not on social media except to post this and will no longer need this if my future husband finds me. Modern dating has never scratched the itch I needed it too. I love love. I love hard. Unapologetically. Loudly. Deeply. I am no quitter and have loved and have lost like most of us have, but I refuse to be bitter. I have so much love and abundance to give to the right person.

The dream? I have worked hard and operate in a way everyday that would make my younger self proud. I have my own home with land to grow. Just would like someone to share everyday with, but I am comfortable on my own. Open to relocating for the right person if things progress. I know what I want and I am a huge believer in manifestation, but I’m open minded for the right person. I really want to be a stay at home mom. Maybe homeschooling the kiddos supporting their special interests. Having a few goats and definitely chickens. Gardening. I imagine a nice goober of a golden retriever. Visiting as many state and national parks possible. A house full of laughter and love. A shared sentiment of wanting to give any kids a better and healthier life than what we had. Healthy routines and open communication. Check ins. A best friend for all the good and hard times. Priceless memories and comforting silence. Hold each other’s hand when it’s all said and done that we conquered it all and just leave behind a legacy that we are both insanely proud of.

Bonus points if you are open to music festivals and can nurture van life/homesteading dreams. Hawaii or somewhere tropical if you really want to win my heart or let me at least excitedly tell you why.

You

-Fierce integrity and strong moral values

-Have a healthy relationship with anger

-Passionate to be the provider and patriarch of our family

-No games. Just wanting to share your life with someone. I don’t want to invest in you and open up just for you to be gone and moved on in a few months.

-Respect me as not your equal, but how valuable I am for polishing the pedestal. I want to be molded and guided. I truly believe the biggest act of love, respect, service, and adoration is giving the one you admire most a baby. I will not tolerate or give any disrespect.

-Prefer men under 40, who take care of themselves. I want someone who will go to the gym with me. Dominant, who wants to mold and guide their submissive. Has a job they are passionate about.

-Monogamous, but open minded to a potential sister wife down the road

-Match my trust, loyalty, and ride or die energy

Dealbreakers? I do not wear makeup, more comfortable in overalls than a dress, but I clean up nicely. I’m working towards the dream body, but not bbw curvy though in all the right places though. Don’t care too much for politics. Grew up religious, but haven’t been to service in a long time. Not interested in talking about nsfw until a friendship is established. I know my worth and will respect your boundaries so I expect this in return.

I’m 5’5, Caucasian/White, brown eyes and hair

All this too say, I make a mean smoothie and scramble and would make a wholesome and fun wife.

I appreciate effort, I want to get to know you introduce yourself, what intrigued you about my post and include a SFW picture if you’re comfortable. I look forward to reading replies. Wish you all the best~",1,1754539066.0,ImpregPersonalsLTR,0,1.0,False

Specific models now feature internal ribbing and thicker walls in key stress areas,extending the lifespan of each tube and reducing the need for frequent replacements during a fishing session.

**Realistic Action:** Subtle design tweaks create a more natural and enticing fall and swim action underwater.

Most of The innovative gitzit tubes incorporate precisely angled ribs and a thin, flexible skirt. This combination creates a lifelike spiraling action as the tube sinks. The skirt flares out naturally during bottom contact and movement, mimicking the presentation of a subtle fleeing baitfish. Some designs even include micro-fins along the body to enhance water displacement and vibration, further attracting fish to the lure.

**Scent Infusion Technology:** Advanced scent infusion techniques result in longer-lasting and more potent attractants integrated directly into the plastic.

These new tubes are infused with proprietary blends of natural fish attractants, using micro-encapsulation technology. This ensures a slow and continuous release of the scent even after prolonged use in the water. The scent formulas mimic the natural odors of common prey like crawfish, shad, and minnows, stimulating feeding behavior in a variety of fish species.

**UV Reflective Colors:** Certain colors now include UV reflective pigments,increasing visibility in various water conditions.

the inclusion of UV reflective pigments boosts the tube's visibility in both clear and murky water. This is particularly critically important in low-light conditions or when fishing deep water where light penetration is limited. The UV-enhanced colors create a shining, eye-catching target that helps fish locate and strike the lure more effectively, leading to increased hookups.**Salt Impregnation:** A generous amount of salt is added to the plastic mix, encouraging fish to hold onto the bait longer.

The high salt content of these tubes makes them incredibly appealing to fish.When a fish bites down on the salted plastic, it gets a realistic taste and texture that compels it to hold on longer, giving the angler more time to detect the strike and set the hook. The added salt also increases the weight of the tube, which can be beneficial for improving casting distance and sink rate.

Key features of the best gitzit tubes for 2025 include:

   Durable,tear-resistant plastic
   Realistic spiraling action
   Long-lasting scent infusion

**Increased Hookup Ratio:** The combination of realistic action, appealing scent, and salty taste encourages fish to hold onto the bait longer, resulting in more solid hookups.

This grants anglers a crucial extra second or two to react and set the hook firmly, leading to a noticeably improved hookup ratio compared to standard soft plastics.

**Versatile Presentation Options:** Gitzit tubes can be rigged in countless ways, making them effective in a variety of fishing situations and for targeting different species.

The inherent versatility of tube baits lies in their compatibility with a vast array of rigging techniques. They can be rigged weightless for surface presentations, Texas-rigged for weedless fishing, carolina-rigged for deep water exploration, or used on jig heads for vertical jigging.

**Effective in Varied Water Conditions:** The availability of UV reflective colors and the natural profile make them effective in both clear and murky water.

These tubes are highly effective in a wide range of water clarity conditions due to their color options and lifelike profile. On clear days, when visibility is high, natural color patterns will have more success to match their surrounding prey. On darker days and murky waters, having UV reflective color patterns will give off a more appealing target.

**Improved Casting Distance and Accuracy:** The added weight from the salt infusion improves casting distance and accuracy, allowing anglers to reach distant targets more easily.The increased salt content in tube baits directly translates to greater casting distance and improved accuracy. The added weight allows anglers to cast further and more efficiently, reaching spots that might be inaccessible with lighter lures. This is particularly beneficial when fishing from shore or covering large expanses of water in search of active fish.

Hello all, I recently moved to Slidell and I’m honestly having a hard time finding things to do around here. It’s been kinda boring so far and I don’t really know where to go to meet people or just hang out. Are there any local spots you’d recommend? Coffee shops, parks, chill places, anything really.

Also, I’m currently looking for a part-time job. I go to school in Jefferson Parish, so I’d need something flexible that can work around my class schedule. If anyone knows of any places hiring or has any advice, I’d really appreciate it.

Thanks in advance

I need your help in trying to send pics of what a “chill” and “fun” and “down to earth” girl would post as my Asian mom is insisting on it.

I’ve deleted most of my feed and tried to keep very simple posts—me at my birthday, grad, a travel pic here and there. But guys have said I seem “posh.”

My Asian mom has been reaming into me about how I ruined my chances of dating a decent guy because of my Instagram feed. She told me I give of a beautiful and wealthy and accomplished vibe which guys hate. I’ve deleted everything from my IG at this point except for an “acceptable” post or two. I’ve made sure there are no traces of designer bags or expensive places etc. 

At her insistence, I’ve even stripped my LinkedIn down to bare bones. It just has my uni and grades, and the positions I worked at—no description of my accomplishments, just an award here and there.  

What I don’t get is there are girls out there posting restaurants, their travels to Europe, etc but they give off a “chill” vibe in their photos. My Asian mom has been negging me nonstop saying it’s because they have “simple” Europe posts while my posts of me holding a tiny cupcake on my birthday look calculated???

But I never plan what I post. Those girls have a beautiful curated feed, and they look carefree despite their obvious wealth. I post once in a blue moon, for example if I see a tree in Spain I’ll just post a simple pic under it. But apparently it’s “annoying” and “stuck up” when I do it but if other people post a bunch of photos of them with the Eiffel Tower, it’s considered cute and down-to-earth. 

So I won’t deny that there’s probably a problem with how I post—I know I cannot share my personal pictures here. However, I want to try to remedy this. Asian mom is scolding me but refusing to help—she just says post something that looks chill. Can someone send me ideas or pics of how chill and down-to-earth people post? 

People who have met me irl generally think I’m a nice person but some people say my Instagram makes me look wealthy even with a stripped down feed of 3-5 photos. Like, my other photos are a cup of coffee and a picture of the beach. Apparently I give off rich girl vibes (vs people who actually post their Europe travels, business class, fancy restos and flowers etc) and I don’t know how to stop it. I just wanna know how to look “chill.” ",1,1754538745.0,internetparents,1,1.0,False

That’s what the world believes. And I let them.
After watching Christian seal the mate bond with my twin sister—my runaway bride of a sister—I smiled, walked out, and never looked back.
By sunrise, I’d bought an island.
By nightfall, I faked my death.
Now, I wear a new name and carry a colder heart.
Then he appeared—an Alpha cloaked in shadows.
""Do you have any wishes?"" he asked.
I only had one.
""I want them to suffer the way I did.""
He smiled like the devil.
""Done.""
————————
I’ve been Christian’s Luna for five years—five whole years.

But he never marked me. Never sealed the mate bond with me.

Every time I brought it up, he’d brush me off with a smile. 

“Blair, I’m too busy. Pack matters are piling up. Sealing the mate bond? What difference does it make?”

And I believed him. I always did. Until today.

I saw it with my own eyes—Christian, standing before the pack elders, sealing the mate bond… with my twin sister Carrie, the one who vanished five years ago.

In that moment, my wolf let out a low, guttural growl inside me, her claws tearing at my heart.

Carrie’s eyes were red with tears as she threw herself into his arms, gripping the bond-sealing contract tightly.

“Christian, it was my fault… I left you at the altar…” Her voice trembled. “I know you’re only agreeing to this because I have cancer. But I still have to ask—after all these years, did you ever forget me? Did you actually fall in love with Blair?”

He was silent for what felt like a century.

I stood nearby, my nails digging deep into my palms. 

Blood trickled down my fingers. Even my wolf was trembling.

“No,” he finally said, voice cold as a winter frost. “Never.”

Carrie instantly broke into tears of joy. She rose on tiptoe and kissed him.

And him… his hand hovered for a moment—then settled on her waist, deepening the kiss.

“No—!”

My wolf let out a furious roar. A violent storm surged through my veins. My fingertips went numb, my bones tensing until I could feel my claws threatening to break through skin.

But none of them looked my way. Not even once.

Beeeeeeep—

A car horn blared, sharp and sudden. I lift my head up.

Three black Maybachs pulled up nearby. Out stepped the three Alphas of the Bloodstone Pack—my three older brothers: Lysander, Orion, and Zayden.

“The bond-sealing deal’s signed? Mate bond sealed too?” Zayden clapped his hands. “Great. Restaurant’s booked. Let’s go celebrate.”

Cold seeping into my bones like I'd been thrown into a sea.

These were the same brothers who made me breakfast this morning with their own hands.

Carrie sobbed as she ran into their arms, like a little girl finally returning home. “I thought… I thought you all didn’t want me anymore…”

The three of them exchanged glances, their expressions complicated. In the end, Zayden reached out and ruffled her hair, tone indulgent like always. 

“Silly girl. You’ve been causing trouble since you were little. When have we not cleaned up your mess?”

Carrie wiped her tears away and looped her arms through theirs like it was second nature. The four of them walked into the cars, all smiles and laughter.

Not one of them looked back at me.

Only when their cars disappeared from view did I finally collapse against a tree—like my heart had just been ripped out.

The bark scraped my skin, but that pain was nothing compared to the way my heart had been torn wide open.

Carrie was always the one everyone adored. Ever since we were kids.

We were twins—but we were never equals.

When I had a fever, my brothers took her to the amusement park. When I spent my birthday alone, she got gifts from the entire pack with my brothers at her side.

I crushed on Christian for ten years—he was my fated mate—but one look from her, and he rejected me and kissed her hand instead.

I thought it was my fate—to be unloved, to be the forgotten placeholder.

Until she ran away from her own wedding.

Wearing a million-dollar gown, she eloped with an Omega and dragged two packs through the mud.

That night, my brothers announced I was their only sister from then on.

And that same night, Christian stumbled drunk into my room.

He pinned me against the wall, twirling my damp hair around his fingers, eyes hazy. “You look just like her…”

Then he pulled out the wedding ring meant for Carrie… and slipped it onto my finger.

“She’s gone. So… be my Luna. You’re my mate anyway, right?”

I knew I shouldn’t have said yes. But I loved him too much. For far too long.

For five years, he treated me like royalty.

Sapphires, Eiffel Tower dates, diamonds, candlelit banquets—anything I so much as glanced at, he’d have it procured and laid at my feet.

Whenever I had nightmares, he’d drop everything and hold me close, whispering comfort in my ear.

Even my brothers changed. It was like Carrie never existed.

I thought, maybe… maybe I finally had love that belonged to me.

But Carrie came back.

And all that love began to recede like the tide, pulling me away one inch at a time.

I watched the Maybachs disappear, and I couldn’t hold it in anymore—I laughed.

At first, it was low and shaky. Then it grew louder, sharper, uncontrollable. I doubled over, laughing until tears mixed with blood fell to the ground.

Passersby stared. No one came near.

They didn’t understand—I wasn’t crazy. My heart had simply been chewed up and spit out.

Turns out, these past few years—I was just a thief.

I stole her love, her title, and even her Alpha.

And now she was back.

Which meant I, the sub$titute, had to step aside.

I wiped my tears and straightened up. My wolf howled inside me, raging, tearing apart every last trace of soft illusions.

“If all of you… only ever loved her…”

I spat each word like venom, “Then I don’t want any of you either.”

I raised my hand and flagged down a cab.

Half an hour later, I pushed open a heavy door and walked up to the front desk.

“I’d like to buy an uninhabited island.”

The receptionist froze, stunned. Then quickly called for the owner.

He was in his forties, sharp and cautious. “Luna, the island you chose has no signal, no route access. Supply boats only visit every three months. Once you’re there, you’ll be completely cut off. Are you sure?”

I looked him dead in the eye, gaze as cold and wild as a feral beast. 

“I’m sure.”

The shop owner glanced at my red-rimmed eyes but thought better than to ask.

He quickly sorted through the documents, speaking respectfully. “We’ll finalize the paperwork as soon as possible. Once everything’s ready, we’ll notify you immediately about the departure to the island.”

Without hesitation, I signed my name and pulled a black card from my wallet. My movements were sharp and decisive. As the payment went through, my hand didn’t tremble in the slightest—like the wolf inside me had already stopped struggling and turned to ice.

Outside, darkness had swallowed the sky. The clouds hung low, and the air carried the metallic tang of a gathering storm.

Back at the pack house, I stepped into the foyer—only to be hit with the warm glow of lights… and the sound of familiar, yet foreign, laughter.

My pupils constricted.

Christian was sitting on the couch, smiling as he peeled an apple for Carrie. His fingers were long and graceful, moving with the precision of someone sculpting a lover’s statue. My three brothers were sitting nearby, loyal guards standing watch.

“Carrie,” Orion coaxed gently, “take the med1cine.”

“It’s so bitter…” Carrie whined, her voice all sweet and delicate.

Zayden immediately pulled out a piece of chocolate from his pocket. 

“This was your favorite as a kid. I always keep one on me.”

I stood frozen at the doorway, my fingertips digging hard into my palm. Blood slowly seeped out—but I felt nothing.

“Blair?” Christian was the first to notice me. He got up and walked toward me. “Where were you all day? I didn’t see you once.”

His voice was soft. 

Like he wasn’t the same man who stood right in front of me earlier—sealing the mate bond with Carrie.

I didn’t answer. 

My gaze slid past him and landed on Carrie—the sister who’d once run away from her wedding and shattered my entire life.

Christian followed my eyes, then offered a quiet explanation. “Carrie’s sick. Terminal. She just wants to spend her last days with family. I know she was wrong to run back then, but she’s still your sister. For your sake—”

“For my sake?” I let out a laugh, cold and low. My voice rumbled into a growl. “Or is it because you never actually let her go?”

His expression darkened. “Blair…”

“Blair.” Lysander—my eldest brother—stepped up. He reached for my head out of habit but froze mid-air, changing the gesture into a pat on my shoulder. “Carrie doesn’t have much time left. It’s not like our pack can’t afford to take care of one more person…”

“Yeah,” Orion chimed in, “She’s been through a lot out there. She knows she messed up. But we’re family.”

“You’re the sensible one, right?” Zayden said from behind me, voice laced with pressure.

I clenched my jaw. My wolf snarled inside me, thrashing, ready to tear everything apart—but there was no outlet for her rage.

Finally, I muttered, “Fine.”

Finally, satisfied smiles spread across their faces.

“Keep Carrie company,” Christian said. “We’ll go prepare a room for her.”

After they went upstairs, Carrie slowly rose from the couch and walked over. Her face looked pale, but the gleam in her eyes betrayed her delight.

“Blair, it’s been five years. I brought you a little gift.”

I instinctively took a step back. Every instinct screamed that something was wrong.

She smiled sweetly as she shoved a box wrapped in black ribbon into my arms—then, ever so thoughtfully, lifted the lid.

“AH—!”

A pitch-black snake sh0t out of the box and sank its fangs deep into my wrist.

The pain hit me like lightning, tearing straight through nerves and bone. I almost screamed.

I flung the box away in pure panic—hitting her square in the shoulder.

She dropped to the floor with a dramatic shriek. 

“Ow! It hurts!”

Thundering footsteps echoed from upstairs. All four men rushed down—only to see Carrie on the ground in tears, and me, standing in a pool of blood, venom dripping from my wrist.

“What are you doing?!” Christian roared, shoving me aside.

I stumbled, crashing into the coffee table. Something in my ribcage cracked.

“She put a snake in the box...” I rasped, voice barely audible.

“Nonsense!” Zayden’s roar made my ears ring. “Carrie’s body is too weak—how could she hurt you?!”

“Christian… Orion… please... I just wanted to make peace with Blair,” Carrie sobbed, crawling into Orion’s arms. “I don’t know why she misunderstood me like this…”

Cold seeped into every inch of my body. I tried to reach for the box—to prove I wasn’t lying—but Christian gripped my injured wrist and yanked me back.

“Enough!” he snapped, hurling me aside. The twin puncture marks on my wrist were clear as day. “She’s your sister! And you would pull a stunt like this?!”

They scooped Carrie into their arms and left—without once looking back.

I collapsed to my knees—the venom spread fast, my vision blurred and my ears buzzed like bees trapped in my skull. Something inside me was screaming.

“Luna! Luna!” I barely made out Lexie’s voice—the maid of the packhouse in charge of cleaning.

I forced my eyes open, but everything was a blur. I could only see the ceiling.

They rushed me to the hospital. But what I heard next—

“Sorry, all the pack doctors are treating Carrie. Her condition suddenly worsened. Orders are in—only she gets care today.”

I laughed—a broken, blood-choked sound, a wolf’s howl dying somewhere deep in my throat.

Lexie screamed through tears, “Luna’s dying! If you let her die, I swear I’ll report you to the Alpha Council!”

No one listened.

I fumbled for my phone and called Christian. My voice was barely a whisper.

“I… got bitten by a venomous snake… can your pack… send a healer…?”

“Blair!” His voice on the other end was glacial. “Carrie’s condition worsened after you pushed her! And you’re still playing games?!”

“It wasn’t me… I swear…”

Click. 

He hung up.

I stared at the screen, stunned. Tears slid silently down my face. 

Pain—sharp, burning pain—ripped through every inch of my body. But worse than that… was the ache in my heart.

My wolf howled inside me, but no one answered.

I slowly closed my eyes. And wished I could disappear—forever.

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled my nose as I opened my eyes. It burned all the way to my scalp.

“Luna! You’re finally awake!” Lexie threw herself to my bedside, eyes swollen, gripping my cold fingers like they were her lifeline. Her hands were rough—but somehow, they carried a warmth I’d almost forgotten.

“I…” My throat felt torn to shreds. I could barely speak. “How… did I survive?”

Tears spilled from her eyes again. “A kind-hearted healer. He was just visiting our pack and happened to see the snake that bit you. He went to the infirmary, realized you were poisoned, and… he couldn’t just stand by.”

“He risked being punished and gave you antivenom in secret. He said… if it had been ten minutes later, you wouldn’t have made it.”

My he@rt gave a jolt.

“I begged Alpha Lysander to believe you’d been bitten,” Lexie choked out, her voice trembling. “He said you were faking it. Alpha Orion refused to even see me. And Alpha Zayden… he said you deserved it.”

I clenched the blanket, nails digging into my palm—yet I felt no pain.

“Alpha Christian was the worst!” she nearly sobbed. “I got on my knees and begged him to come check on you. He said… said you were just being dramatic again. Said I was helping you put on a show.”

Lexie held my hand like it was the only thing keeping her grounded. “Luna, you were always so good to them. Last winter, Alpha Lysander came home drunk after a late-night pack summit—you boiled him a bitter tonic in the freezing kitchen and caught a cold yourself.”

“When Alpha Orion got into gambling trouble, you secretly sold your grandmother’s heirloom to pay off his debts. When Zayden had a fever for three days straight, you stayed by his side until you passed out.”

She couldn’t continue, tears choking her voice. “And Alpha Christian… the coffee beans he likes, the brand of ties he wears—things even his mother can’t remember. You remembered everything. And now, they’re all fawning over Carrie. That sister who bullied you your whole life, the one who ran from her wedding like a coward—now she’s the adored Luna?!”

I didn’t say a word.

Tears streamed down my cheeks, soaking the pillow beneath me. They burned like acid, each drop cutting deeper than the last.

But none of that compared to the pain in my chest.

It didn’t matter. It would all be over soon.

I’d already signed the paperwork for the island. A place far from the mainland. 

No betrayal. No lies. No them.

Two days later, I returned “home.”

The moment I pushed open the door, I was ambushed by a blast of birthday music—piercing, clawing at my eardrums, tangled with laughter and the clink of champagne glasses.

Under the crystal chandelier, Carrie stood by the cake in a flowing gown, her smile radiant. My three brothers and Christian surrounded her.

The scene was so familiar, it made my stomach turn.

I stood there at the entrance. The air hung heavy and still.

“I thought she was supposed to be dying?” Lysander sh0t me a cold, cutting glare from behind his glasses.

Orion took a sip of wine, brows furrowed. “She doesn’t have long to live. Can’t you cut her some slack?”

Zayden snorted. “Same old drama. Can’t she come up with a new act?”

Christian walked toward me, that ever-so-gentle façade still in place. “I know you’re upset about my past with Carrie,” he said. “But you have to understand—my Luna, my wife now, is you.”

Luna? Wife?

A loud crack exploded in my head.

I stood by his side through ruin and disaster. Through every storm and sleepless night. I gave him everything.

And now—the one who sealed the mate bond with him, the one who was marked by him… was Carrie.

So this… this is what they called a “fated mate”?

I stared at him, laughing coldly. Even the way my lips curved felt like someone else’s. My he@rt had been torn apart—but I wasn’t afraid anymore. My blood was boiling. My wolf was awakening.

Then Carrie’s voice rang out, bright and sweet. 

“Christian, Lysander, Orion, Zayden—come cut the cake with me!”

The big screen lit up. It started off with well-wishes from guests. But just as everyone began to wonder what came next—the screen abruptly changed.

Explicit images of Carrie with a young Omega were broadcast to the entire pack. 

“A birthday gift for you.”

The blood-red words burned into her soul—my answer, carved in flame.

“Turn it off! Now!” Lysander roared.

Orion ripped the power cord from the wall. Zayden tore through the crowd like a madman, snatching guests’ phones.

Carrie stumbled back, pale as a corpse. “You already stole their love… Why are you humiliating me too?!”

Then she collapsed to the floor, sobbing like her world had ended. Christian rushed to scoop her up, his face full of panic.

“Call the healer! Now!”

Before he carried her off, he looked back at me. That look… As if he didn’t know who I was.

Lysander grabbed my arm, voice like rolling thunder. “Blair, look at what you’ve done!”

I gasped, trying to hold it together. “It wasn’t me… I didn’t do it…”

“Still lying?” Orion sneered. “In the Bloodstone Pack, mistakes are punished.”

Punished?

I froze.

When I was twelve, Carrie pushed me down the stairs—it was my fault for being clumsy.

At eighteen, she ruined my birthday cake—they said she was just joking.

That winter, she locked me outside on the balcony—I almost froze to death. They said she was just in a bad mood.

And now—they wanted to punish me?

“Kneel.”

Zayden’s voice cut through me, cold and sharp as a winter wind, leaving my dignity in shreds.

Two towering warriors lunged forward, grabbing my shoulders with brutal force, like I was some kind of prisoner. 

I fought instinctively—my wolf refused to bow—but they were too strong. 

They slammed me down onto the cold stone floor.

My knees crashed against the ground as pain shooting straight through my bones, and the world blurred for a moment.

Lysander raised the vine whip he’d prepared. It sliced through the air with a shriek. A heartbeat later—

Crack!

Agony ripped across my back like lightning. I bit down hard on my lip, tasting blood, but refused to make a sound.

My wolf raged inside me—furious, rebellious—but I forced her down with sheer willpower.

“Do you admit your mistake?” Lysander’s voice was ice.

“I didn’t do anything wrong…” My voice was hoarse, each word like glass in my throat.

Crack!

This one was worse. The whip tore through the thin fabric of my dress, burning straight into my f1esh. Wet heat spread across my back—I was bleeding. 

I knew that pain. That wasn’t an ordinary whip. It was a silver-threaded wolf whip, made specifically to punish those who defy the Alpha.

“Do you admit your mistake?”

“I didn’t…”

Again. And again. Each lash meant to break me—not just my body, but my soul.

Bl00d mixed with the howls of my wolf, roaring inside me. 

I stayed silent, biting down until I tasted copper. My white dress was soaked in crimson, the floor beneath me painted in a grotesque pattern of red.

“Stop! Please—stop!”

Lexie, the aging maid, fell to her knees, sobbing. “She’s going to die! Luna’s going to die if you keep going!”

But my three brothers didn’t flinch. Didn’t pause. They acted like they couldn’t hear her—like I wasn’t even human.

My vision dimmed. The edges of the world crumbled. 

All I could hear was Zayden’s mocking voice, “If she won’t admit it, then we’ll beat her until she does.”

The last lash fell—and with it, my consciousness. Darkness swallowed me whole.

And the last thing I saw… was my bl00d poo1ing on the ground, and the cold, merciless eyes of the three men who used to be my family.

They were once my brothers. My protectors. My blood. Now? 

They were the ones holding the b1ade.

I was locked in a room for three full days with no visitors and no one even brought me water.

My wounds had festered, the silver threads still burning beneath my skin. I curled up on the bed like a dying animal, clinging to life by a thread.

And next door? A different world entirely.

Carrie’s voice drifted through the wall, soft and sweet. My brothers whispering back to her, comforting her. Even Christian’s low laugh echoed in. Each sound cut deep, flaying my he@rt raw.

“Carrie, take your medicine.”

“Nooo, it’s so bitter…”

“Be good. Finish it and I’ll give you candy.”

“Then Christian, you need to feed me.”

I buried my face in the pillow, my nails digging into my palms. Wolves heal fast—but not from betrayal.

I thought I was numb. But every breath still $tabbed at my chest.

On the fourth morning, I finally managed to stand. Leaning on the wall, I dragged myself to the staircase—and that’s when I heard it.

“There’ve been dolphins near the coast lately,” Christian said, a rare note of excitement in his voice. “Carrie’s always wanted to see them.”

“Then let’s go today,” the three brothers chimed in.

I froze. 

My fingers trembled against the railing.

My wounds hadn’t even closed. Every step felt like knives slicing through my back.

“Blair?” Carrie looked up and gasped. “You’re finally out of bed!”

All four men turned to me. Their eyes… it was like I was a stranger.

I was nothing but skin and bone, the loose nightgown hanging off me like a sheet while bruises covered my wrists like broken jewelry.

“We’re heading out to see the dolphins,” Carrie said, rushing over and clinging to my arm like we were best friends. “You should come too!”

I pulled away without thinking. Tears instantly welled in her eyes.

“Blair, I already forgave you,” she said, choking up. “Even after you ruined my reputation… I don’t want to hold grudges. I don’t have much time left…”

“Blair!” Christian stormed over and shielded her with his body. “She’s offering you peace, and this is how you respond?”

Zayden scoffed. “Look at Carrie, then look at you. It’s not even close.”

I bit down on my lip until I tasted blood again.

These men—once the ones closest to me—were now more distant than strangers.

They brought me on the yacht, saying it was to make Carrie happy.

The sun blazed down on the deck, so bright I could barely keep my eyes open.

Carrie giggled, suggesting a barbecue.

“I’m dying soon… can’t I at least do what I want?” she murmured, voice soft as silk.

“Don’t talk nonsense!” Orion quickly covered her mouth. “We’ve found the best healer in the entire werewolf realm. You’ll be fine.”

I sat quietly in the corner, watching them fawn over her like she was the only one who mattered.

No one remembered I was allergic to seafood.

No one remembered my back was still an open wound.

No one—cared.

“Why aren’t you eating?” Christian finally noticed me.

“I… I’m allergic to seafood,” I whispered.

The mood shifted immediately. Christian frowned and was about to ask the crew to change the menu—when a sudden gust of wind slammed into the yacht!

The boat lurched, tipping the grill and sending burning coals skittering across the deck.

“Watch out—!”

All four men leapt toward Carrie, shielding her like she was the moon and they were her tides.

And me?

A burning coal landed on my dress, and fire instantly spread across the fabric.

I rolled across the deck, screaming as flames se@red through skin and nerves.

But... not a single one of them turned to look at me.

The four of them were still huddled around Carrie, frantically checking if she was hurt. Her arm was only slightly burned, but they acted like it was the end of the world.

“Carrie! Are you okay?”

“Let me see—any blisters?”

“Get the ointment! Now!”

Meanwhile, I was still burning.

In the end, it was a passing crew member who noticed me. He rushed over, panic in his voice, grabbing the fire extinguisher and dousing the flames consuming my body.

“Hey! Hang in there!” his voice echoed in my ears.

My vision was already blurry. As I looked up, all I saw was the four men carrying Carrie below deck like she was made of glass. Their eyes—every last one of them—were only on her. Not a single glance at me.

They were my brothers, the blood I once trusted, but in my moment of agony, not one of them turned around.

By the time the crew carried me back to my room, every breath I took felt like knives in my chest.

The fire had torn through my skin, the burns so deep they clung to the bone. Every movement sent fresh blood oozing out. 

I could feel the wolf inside me howling, trying to trigger my healing instincts. But the silver-lined whip wounds and the burns had suppressed it all—my recovery was crawling at a snail’s pace.

The room was empty—I was completely alone.

My phone buzzed.

I barely managed to lift my arm and answered the call.

“Luna, we still need a few documents for the private island you purchased.”

“I’ll send them… right away…” I rasped, voice hoarse from pain. “Please, finalize everything. I need to get there… as soon as possible.”

I had nowhere else to go. Nowhere left but that island I’d bought with my own hands—isolated, far away from everything.

But just as I hung up, a cold, all-too-familiar voice sounded behind me.

“Who were you talking to?”

Christian.

I quickly shoved my phone under the covers and forced myself to act calm. “No one.”

He stood at the door, gaze dropping to the burns on my body. His brows instantly furrowed.

“What happened to you?” He strode over, and for once, I heard a rare flicker of panic in his voice. “Why didn’t you call me?”

I looked down and gave him a bitter smile.

Call him?

I was screaming on the deck, my dress on fire, my skin burning, even my hair singed. And yet he, along with the other three, had all lunged for Carrie like she was the only one that mattered. None of them even looked back.

How could I possibly… still call out to him?

“I’m fine,” I whispered. “The healer’s on the way. You should go. Be with Carrie… She needs you more.”

To my surprise, he sat down beside my bed. “She’s got people with her. I’ll stay until you’ve had your wounds treated.”

He reached out and gently brushed the hair from my forehead. The gesture was soft… familiar. But I simply stared at him, calm and distant, the spark I once felt for him completely gone.

He belonged to someone else now—Carrie’s mate.

Her husband.

He had marked her behind my back—sealed the mate bond. From that moment on, there was no going back for us.

“Does it hurt?” he asked softly, brows drawn together.

I shook my head lightly.

Hurt? Of course it did. 

My skin was splitting, rough like cracked bark, every breeze stinging like acid.

But none of that compared to the pain inside.

The healer arrived quickly, tending to my burns with the utmost care. Every touch was like a knife, but I didn’t make a sound—I bit down and bore it. I didn’t want to scream. My wolf wouldn’t allow me to break down in front of them.

Outside the door, Carrie’s overly sweet voice rang out, “Christian! Come see the dolphins! They’re so beautiful!”

He hesitated, then finally stood and helped me up. “Come with me. Let’s go take a look.”

I didn’t refuse. Didn’t have the strength to.

Out on the deck, the sea shimmered gold beneath the setting sun. A pod of dolphins leapt from the water, their graceful arcs slicing through the waves like something out of a dream.

Carrie clasped her hands and closed her eyes like a child making a wish. “Hurry! Make a wish! I heard if you wish while watching dolphins, it always comes true!”

He laid me gently onto a lounge chair. I sat there, surrounded by faces I once knew—now strangers.

They all closed their eyes, too. People who never believed in this kind of thing, now silently making wishes like devoted believers.

I knew every wish in their he@rts… was for her.

I closed my eyes too.

I could feel my wolf growling within me, desperate to break free, to destroy everything, to make them all pay. But I was calmer than her.

I knew I had to survive, to leave this ship, to cut every last tie to my past.

“Blair, what did you wish for?” Carrie leaned over, whispering in my ear—sweet, soft, and enough to make my skin crawl.

The four men turned to me as well.

I opened my eyes and looked at all five of them—faces once dear to me, now nothing but poison.

Then I spoke, clear and slow, 

“My wish… is to never see Christian, Lysander, Orion, Zayden, or Carrie… ever again.”",1,1754538734.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

That’s what the world believes. And I let them.

By nightfall, I faked my death.

————————
I’ve been Christian’s Luna for five years—five whole years.

But he never marked me. Never sealed the mate bond with me.

Every time I brought it up, he’d brush me off with a smile. 

“Blair, I’m too busy. Pack matters are piling up. Sealing the mate bond? What difference does it make?”

And I believed him. I always did. Until today.

I saw it with my own eyes—Christian, standing before the pack elders, sealing the mate bond… with my twin sister Carrie, the one who vanished five years ago.

In that moment, my wolf let out a low, guttural growl inside me, her claws tearing at my heart.

Carrie’s eyes were red with tears as she threw herself into his arms, gripping the bond-sealing contract tightly.

“Christian, it was my fault… I left you at the altar…” Her voice trembled. “I know you’re only agreeing to this because I have cancer. But I still have to ask—after all these years, did you ever forget me? Did you actually fall in love with Blair?”

He was silent for what felt like a century.

I stood nearby, my nails digging deep into my palms. 

Blood trickled down my fingers. Even my wolf was trembling.

“No,” he finally said, voice cold as a winter frost. “Never.”

Carrie instantly broke into tears of joy. She rose on tiptoe and kissed him.

And him… his hand hovered for a moment—then settled on her waist, deepening the kiss.

“No—!”

My wolf let out a furious roar. A violent storm surged through my veins. My fingertips went numb, my bones tensing until I could feel my claws threatening to break through skin.

But none of them looked my way. Not even once.

Beeeeeeep—

A car horn blared, sharp and sudden. I lift my head up.

Three black Maybachs pulled up nearby. Out stepped the three Alphas of the Bloodstone Pack—my three older brothers: Lysander, Orion, and Zayden.

“The bond-sealing deal’s signed? Mate bond sealed too?” Zayden clapped his hands. “Great. Restaurant’s booked. Let’s go celebrate.”

Cold seeping into my bones like I'd been thrown into a sea.

These were the same brothers who made me breakfast this morning with their own hands.

Carrie sobbed as she ran into their arms, like a little girl finally returning home. “I thought… I thought you all didn’t want me anymore…”

The three of them exchanged glances, their expressions complicated. In the end, Zayden reached out and ruffled her hair, tone indulgent like always. 

“Silly girl. You’ve been causing trouble since you were little. When have we not cleaned up your mess?”

Carrie wiped her tears away and looped her arms through theirs like it was second nature. The four of them walked into the cars, all smiles and laughter.

Not one of them looked back at me.

Only when their cars disappeared from view did I finally collapse against a tree—like my heart had just been ripped out.

The bark scraped my skin, but that pain was nothing compared to the way my heart had been torn wide open.

Carrie was always the one everyone adored. Ever since we were kids.

We were twins—but we were never equals.

When I had a fever, my brothers took her to the amusement park. When I spent my birthday alone, she got gifts from the entire pack with my brothers at her side.

I crushed on Christian for ten years—he was my fated mate—but one look from her, and he rejected me and kissed her hand instead.

I thought it was my fate—to be unloved, to be the forgotten placeholder.

Until she ran away from her own wedding.

Wearing a million-dollar gown, she eloped with an Omega and dragged two packs through the mud.

That night, my brothers announced I was their only sister from then on.

And that same night, Christian stumbled drunk into my room.

He pinned me against the wall, twirling my damp hair around his fingers, eyes hazy. “You look just like her…”

Then he pulled out the wedding ring meant for Carrie… and slipped it onto my finger.

“She’s gone. So… be my Luna. You’re my mate anyway, right?”

I knew I shouldn’t have said yes. But I loved him too much. For far too long.

For five years, he treated me like royalty.

Sapphires, Eiffel Tower dates, diamonds, candlelit banquets—anything I so much as glanced at, he’d have it procured and laid at my feet.

Whenever I had nightmares, he’d drop everything and hold me close, whispering comfort in my ear.

Even my brothers changed. It was like Carrie never existed.

I thought, maybe… maybe I finally had love that belonged to me.

But Carrie came back.

And all that love began to recede like the tide, pulling me away one inch at a time.

I watched the Maybachs disappear, and I couldn’t hold it in anymore—I laughed.

At first, it was low and shaky. Then it grew louder, sharper, uncontrollable. I doubled over, laughing until tears mixed with blood fell to the ground.

Passersby stared. No one came near.

They didn’t understand—I wasn’t crazy. My heart had simply been chewed up and spit out.

Turns out, these past few years—I was just a thief.

I stole her love, her title, and even her Alpha.

And now she was back.

Which meant I, the sub$titute, had to step aside.

I wiped my tears and straightened up. My wolf howled inside me, raging, tearing apart every last trace of soft illusions.

“If all of you… only ever loved her…”

I spat each word like venom, “Then I don’t want any of you either.”

I raised my hand and flagged down a cab.

Half an hour later, I pushed open a heavy door and walked up to the front desk.

“I’d like to buy an uninhabited island.”

The receptionist froze, stunned. Then quickly called for the owner.

He was in his forties, sharp and cautious. “Luna, the island you chose has no signal, no route access. Supply boats only visit every three months. Once you’re there, you’ll be completely cut off. Are you sure?”

I looked him dead in the eye, gaze as cold and wild as a feral beast. 

“I’m sure.”

The shop owner glanced at my red-rimmed eyes but thought better than to ask.

He quickly sorted through the documents, speaking respectfully. “We’ll finalize the paperwork as soon as possible. Once everything’s ready, we’ll notify you immediately about the departure to the island.”

Without hesitation, I signed my name and pulled a black card from my wallet. My movements were sharp and decisive. As the payment went through, my hand didn’t tremble in the slightest—like the wolf inside me had already stopped struggling and turned to ice.

Outside, darkness had swallowed the sky. The clouds hung low, and the air carried the metallic tang of a gathering storm.

Back at the pack house, I stepped into the foyer—only to be hit with the warm glow of lights… and the sound of familiar, yet foreign, laughter.

My pupils constricted.

Christian was sitting on the couch, smiling as he peeled an apple for Carrie. His fingers were long and graceful, moving with the precision of someone sculpting a lover’s statue. My three brothers were sitting nearby, loyal guards standing watch.

“Carrie,” Orion coaxed gently, “take the med1cine.”

“It’s so bitter…” Carrie whined, her voice all sweet and delicate.

Zayden immediately pulled out a piece of chocolate from his pocket. 

“This was your favorite as a kid. I always keep one on me.”

I stood frozen at the doorway, my fingertips digging hard into my palm. Blood slowly seeped out—but I felt nothing.

“Blair?” Christian was the first to notice me. He got up and walked toward me. “Where were you all day? I didn’t see you once.”

His voice was soft. 

Like he wasn’t the same man who stood right in front of me earlier—sealing the mate bond with Carrie.

I didn’t answer. 

My gaze slid past him and landed on Carrie—the sister who’d once run away from her wedding and shattered my entire life.

Christian followed my eyes, then offered a quiet explanation. “Carrie’s sick. Terminal. She just wants to spend her last days with family. I know she was wrong to run back then, but she’s still your sister. For your sake—”

“For my sake?” I let out a laugh, cold and low. My voice rumbled into a growl. “Or is it because you never actually let her go?”

His expression darkened. “Blair…”

“Blair.” Lysander—my eldest brother—stepped up. He reached for my head out of habit but froze mid-air, changing the gesture into a pat on my shoulder. “Carrie doesn’t have much time left. It’s not like our pack can’t afford to take care of one more person…”

“Yeah,” Orion chimed in, “She’s been through a lot out there. She knows she messed up. But we’re family.”

“You’re the sensible one, right?” Zayden said from behind me, voice laced with pressure.

I clenched my jaw. My wolf snarled inside me, thrashing, ready to tear everything apart—but there was no outlet for her rage.

Finally, I muttered, “Fine.”

Finally, satisfied smiles spread across their faces.

“Keep Carrie company,” Christian said. “We’ll go prepare a room for her.”

After they went upstairs, Carrie slowly rose from the couch and walked over. Her face looked pale, but the gleam in her eyes betrayed her delight.

“Blair, it’s been five years. I brought you a little gift.”

I instinctively took a step back. Every instinct screamed that something was wrong.

She smiled sweetly as she shoved a box wrapped in black ribbon into my arms—then, ever so thoughtfully, lifted the lid.

“AH—!”

A pitch-black snake sh0t out of the box and sank its fangs deep into my wrist.

The pain hit me like lightning, tearing straight through nerves and bone. I almost screamed.

I flung the box away in pure panic—hitting her square in the shoulder.

She dropped to the floor with a dramatic shriek. 

“Ow! It hurts!”

Thundering footsteps echoed from upstairs. All four men rushed down—only to see Carrie on the ground in tears, and me, standing in a pool of blood, venom dripping from my wrist.

“What are you doing?!” Christian roared, shoving me aside.

I stumbled, crashing into the coffee table. Something in my ribcage cracked.

“She put a snake in the box...” I rasped, voice barely audible.

“Nonsense!” Zayden’s roar made my ears ring. “Carrie’s body is too weak—how could she hurt you?!”

“Christian… Orion… please... I just wanted to make peace with Blair,” Carrie sobbed, crawling into Orion’s arms. “I don’t know why she misunderstood me like this…”

Cold seeped into every inch of my body. I tried to reach for the box—to prove I wasn’t lying—but Christian gripped my injured wrist and yanked me back.

“Enough!” he snapped, hurling me aside. The twin puncture marks on my wrist were clear as day. “She’s your sister! And you would pull a stunt like this?!”

They scooped Carrie into their arms and left—without once looking back.

I collapsed to my knees—the venom spread fast, my vision blurred and my ears buzzed like bees trapped in my skull. Something inside me was screaming.

“Luna! Luna!” I barely made out Lexie’s voice—the maid of the packhouse in charge of cleaning.

I forced my eyes open, but everything was a blur. I could only see the ceiling.

They rushed me to the hospital. But what I heard next—

“Sorry, all the pack doctors are treating Carrie. Her condition suddenly worsened. Orders are in—only she gets care today.”

I laughed—a broken, blood-choked sound, a wolf’s howl dying somewhere deep in my throat.

Lexie screamed through tears, “Luna’s dying! If you let her die, I swear I’ll report you to the Alpha Council!”

No one listened.

I fumbled for my phone and called Christian. My voice was barely a whisper.

“I… got bitten by a venomous snake… can your pack… send a healer…?”

“Blair!” His voice on the other end was glacial. “Carrie’s condition worsened after you pushed her! And you’re still playing games?!”

“It wasn’t me… I swear…”

Click. 

He hung up.

I stared at the screen, stunned. Tears slid silently down my face. 

Pain—sharp, burning pain—ripped through every inch of my body. But worse than that… was the ache in my heart.

My wolf howled inside me, but no one answered.

I slowly closed my eyes. And wished I could disappear—forever.

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled my nose as I opened my eyes. It burned all the way to my scalp.

“Luna! You’re finally awake!” Lexie threw herself to my bedside, eyes swollen, gripping my cold fingers like they were her lifeline. Her hands were rough—but somehow, they carried a warmth I’d almost forgotten.

“I…” My throat felt torn to shreds. I could barely speak. “How… did I survive?”

Tears spilled from her eyes again. “A kind-hearted healer. He was just visiting our pack and happened to see the snake that bit you. He went to the infirmary, realized you were poisoned, and… he couldn’t just stand by.”

“He risked being punished and gave you antivenom in secret. He said… if it had been ten minutes later, you wouldn’t have made it.”

My he@rt gave a jolt.

“I begged Alpha Lysander to believe you’d been bitten,” Lexie choked out, her voice trembling. “He said you were faking it. Alpha Orion refused to even see me. And Alpha Zayden… he said you deserved it.”

I clenched the blanket, nails digging into my palm—yet I felt no pain.

“Alpha Christian was the worst!” she nearly sobbed. “I got on my knees and begged him to come check on you. He said… said you were just being dramatic again. Said I was helping you put on a show.”

Lexie held my hand like it was the only thing keeping her grounded. “Luna, you were always so good to them. Last winter, Alpha Lysander came home drunk after a late-night pack summit—you boiled him a bitter tonic in the freezing kitchen and caught a cold yourself.”

“When Alpha Orion got into gambling trouble, you secretly sold your grandmother’s heirloom to pay off his debts. When Zayden had a fever for three days straight, you stayed by his side until you passed out.”

She couldn’t continue, tears choking her voice. “And Alpha Christian… the coffee beans he likes, the brand of ties he wears—things even his mother can’t remember. You remembered everything. And now, they’re all fawning over Carrie. That sister who bullied you your whole life, the one who ran from her wedding like a coward—now she’s the adored Luna?!”

I didn’t say a word.

Tears streamed down my cheeks, soaking the pillow beneath me. They burned like acid, each drop cutting deeper than the last.

But none of that compared to the pain in my chest.

It didn’t matter. It would all be over soon.

I’d already signed the paperwork for the island. A place far from the mainland. 

No betrayal. No lies. No them.

Two days later, I returned “home.”

The moment I pushed open the door, I was ambushed by a blast of birthday music—piercing, clawing at my eardrums, tangled with laughter and the clink of champagne glasses.

Under the crystal chandelier, Carrie stood by the cake in a flowing gown, her smile radiant. My three brothers and Christian surrounded her.

The scene was so familiar, it made my stomach turn.

I stood there at the entrance. The air hung heavy and still.

“I thought she was supposed to be dying?” Lysander sh0t me a cold, cutting glare from behind his glasses.

Orion took a sip of wine, brows furrowed. “She doesn’t have long to live. Can’t you cut her some slack?”

Zayden snorted. “Same old drama. Can’t she come up with a new act?”

Christian walked toward me, that ever-so-gentle façade still in place. “I know you’re upset about my past with Carrie,” he said. “But you have to understand—my Luna, my wife now, is you.”

Luna? Wife?

A loud crack exploded in my head.

I stood by his side through ruin and disaster. Through every storm and sleepless night. I gave him everything.

And now—the one who sealed the mate bond with him, the one who was marked by him… was Carrie.

So this… this is what they called a “fated mate”?

I stared at him, laughing coldly. Even the way my lips curved felt like someone else’s. My he@rt had been torn apart—but I wasn’t afraid anymore. My blood was boiling. My wolf was awakening.

Then Carrie’s voice rang out, bright and sweet. 

“Christian, Lysander, Orion, Zayden—come cut the cake with me!”

The big screen lit up. It started off with well-wishes from guests. But just as everyone began to wonder what came next—the screen abruptly changed.

Explicit images of Carrie with a young Omega were broadcast to the entire pack. 

“A birthday gift for you.”

The blood-red words burned into her soul—my answer, carved in flame.

“Turn it off! Now!” Lysander roared.

Orion ripped the power cord from the wall. Zayden tore through the crowd like a madman, snatching guests’ phones.

Carrie stumbled back, pale as a corpse. “You already stole their love… Why are you humiliating me too?!”

Then she collapsed to the floor, sobbing like her world had ended. Christian rushed to scoop her up, his face full of panic.

“Call the healer! Now!”

Before he carried her off, he looked back at me. That look… As if he didn’t know who I was.

Lysander grabbed my arm, voice like rolling thunder. “Blair, look at what you’ve done!”

I gasped, trying to hold it together. “It wasn’t me… I didn’t do it…”

“Still lying?” Orion sneered. “In the Bloodstone Pack, mistakes are punished.”

Punished?

I froze.

When I was twelve, Carrie pushed me down the stairs—it was my fault for being clumsy.

At eighteen, she ruined my birthday cake—they said she was just joking.

That winter, she locked me outside on the balcony—I almost froze to death. They said she was just in a bad mood.

And now—they wanted to punish me?

“Kneel.”

Zayden’s voice cut through me, cold and sharp as a winter wind, leaving my dignity in shreds.

Two towering warriors lunged forward, grabbing my shoulders with brutal force, like I was some kind of prisoner. 

I fought instinctively—my wolf refused to bow—but they were too strong. 

They slammed me down onto the cold stone floor.

My knees crashed against the ground as pain shooting straight through my bones, and the world blurred for a moment.

Lysander raised the vine whip he’d prepared. It sliced through the air with a shriek. A heartbeat later—

Crack!

Agony ripped across my back like lightning. I bit down hard on my lip, tasting blood, but refused to make a sound.

My wolf raged inside me—furious, rebellious—but I forced her down with sheer willpower.

“Do you admit your mistake?” Lysander’s voice was ice.

“I didn’t do anything wrong…” My voice was hoarse, each word like glass in my throat.

Crack!

This one was worse. The whip tore through the thin fabric of my dress, burning straight into my f1esh. Wet heat spread across my back—I was bleeding. 

I knew that pain. That wasn’t an ordinary whip. It was a silver-threaded wolf whip, made specifically to punish those who defy the Alpha.

“Do you admit your mistake?”

“I didn’t…”

Again. And again. Each lash meant to break me—not just my body, but my soul.

Bl00d mixed with the howls of my wolf, roaring inside me. 

I stayed silent, biting down until I tasted copper. My white dress was soaked in crimson, the floor beneath me painted in a grotesque pattern of red.

“Stop! Please—stop!”

Lexie, the aging maid, fell to her knees, sobbing. “She’s going to die! Luna’s going to die if you keep going!”

But my three brothers didn’t flinch. Didn’t pause. They acted like they couldn’t hear her—like I wasn’t even human.

My vision dimmed. The edges of the world crumbled. 

All I could hear was Zayden’s mocking voice, “If she won’t admit it, then we’ll beat her until she does.”

The last lash fell—and with it, my consciousness. Darkness swallowed me whole.

And the last thing I saw… was my bl00d poo1ing on the ground, and the cold, merciless eyes of the three men who used to be my family.

They were once my brothers. My protectors. My blood. Now? 

They were the ones holding the b1ade.

I was locked in a room for three full days with no visitors and no one even brought me water.

My wounds had festered, the silver threads still burning beneath my skin. I curled up on the bed like a dying animal, clinging to life by a thread.

And next door? A different world entirely.

Carrie’s voice drifted through the wall, soft and sweet. My brothers whispering back to her, comforting her. Even Christian’s low laugh echoed in. Each sound cut deep, flaying my he@rt raw.

“Carrie, take your medicine.”

“Nooo, it’s so bitter…”

“Be good. Finish it and I’ll give you candy.”

“Then Christian, you need to feed me.”

I buried my face in the pillow, my nails digging into my palms. Wolves heal fast—but not from betrayal.

I thought I was numb. But every breath still $tabbed at my chest.

On the fourth morning, I finally managed to stand. Leaning on the wall, I dragged myself to the staircase—and that’s when I heard it.

“There’ve been dolphins near the coast lately,” Christian said, a rare note of excitement in his voice. “Carrie’s always wanted to see them.”

“Then let’s go today,” the three brothers chimed in.

I froze. 

My fingers trembled against the railing.

My wounds hadn’t even closed. Every step felt like knives slicing through my back.

“Blair?” Carrie looked up and gasped. “You’re finally out of bed!”

All four men turned to me. Their eyes… it was like I was a stranger.

I was nothing but skin and bone, the loose nightgown hanging off me like a sheet while bruises covered my wrists like broken jewelry.

“We’re heading out to see the dolphins,” Carrie said, rushing over and clinging to my arm like we were best friends. “You should come too!”

I pulled away without thinking. Tears instantly welled in her eyes.

“Blair, I already forgave you,” she said, choking up. “Even after you ruined my reputation… I don’t want to hold grudges. I don’t have much time left…”

“Blair!” Christian stormed over and shielded her with his body. “She’s offering you peace, and this is how you respond?”

Zayden scoffed. “Look at Carrie, then look at you. It’s not even close.”

I bit down on my lip until I tasted blood again.

These men—once the ones closest to me—were now more distant than strangers.

They brought me on the yacht, saying it was to make Carrie happy.

The sun blazed down on the deck, so bright I could barely keep my eyes open.

Carrie giggled, suggesting a barbecue.

“I’m dying soon… can’t I at least do what I want?” she murmured, voice soft as silk.

“Don’t talk nonsense!” Orion quickly covered her mouth. “We’ve found the best healer in the entire werewolf realm. You’ll be fine.”

I sat quietly in the corner, watching them fawn over her like she was the only one who mattered.

No one remembered I was allergic to seafood.

No one remembered my back was still an open wound.

No one—cared.

“Why aren’t you eating?” Christian finally noticed me.

“I… I’m allergic to seafood,” I whispered.

The mood shifted immediately. Christian frowned and was about to ask the crew to change the menu—when a sudden gust of wind slammed into the yacht!

The boat lurched, tipping the grill and sending burning coals skittering across the deck.

“Watch out—!”

All four men leapt toward Carrie, shielding her like she was the moon and they were her tides.

And me?

A burning coal landed on my dress, and fire instantly spread across the fabric.

I rolled across the deck, screaming as flames se@red through skin and nerves.

But... not a single one of them turned to look at me.

The four of them were still huddled around Carrie, frantically checking if she was hurt. Her arm was only slightly burned, but they acted like it was the end of the world.

“Carrie! Are you okay?”

“Let me see—any blisters?”

“Get the ointment! Now!”

Meanwhile, I was still burning.

In the end, it was a passing crew member who noticed me. He rushed over, panic in his voice, grabbing the fire extinguisher and dousing the flames consuming my body.

“Hey! Hang in there!” his voice echoed in my ears.

My vision was already blurry. As I looked up, all I saw was the four men carrying Carrie below deck like she was made of glass. Their eyes—every last one of them—were only on her. Not a single glance at me.

They were my brothers, the blood I once trusted, but in my moment of agony, not one of them turned around.

By the time the crew carried me back to my room, every breath I took felt like knives in my chest.

The fire had torn through my skin, the burns so deep they clung to the bone. Every movement sent fresh blood oozing out. 

I could feel the wolf inside me howling, trying to trigger my healing instincts. But the silver-lined whip wounds and the burns had suppressed it all—my recovery was crawling at a snail’s pace.

The room was empty—I was completely alone.

My phone buzzed.

I barely managed to lift my arm and answered the call.

“Luna, we still need a few documents for the private island you purchased.”

“I’ll send them… right away…” I rasped, voice hoarse from pain. “Please, finalize everything. I need to get there… as soon as possible.”

I had nowhere else to go. Nowhere left but that island I’d bought with my own hands—isolated, far away from everything.

But just as I hung up, a cold, all-too-familiar voice sounded behind me.

“Who were you talking to?”

Christian.

I quickly shoved my phone under the covers and forced myself to act calm. “No one.”

He stood at the door, gaze dropping to the burns on my body. His brows instantly furrowed.

“What happened to you?” He strode over, and for once, I heard a rare flicker of panic in his voice. “Why didn’t you call me?”

I looked down and gave him a bitter smile.

Call him?

I was screaming on the deck, my dress on fire, my skin burning, even my hair singed. And yet he, along with the other three, had all lunged for Carrie like she was the only one that mattered. None of them even looked back.

How could I possibly… still call out to him?

“I’m fine,” I whispered. “The healer’s on the way. You should go. Be with Carrie… She needs you more.”

To my surprise, he sat down beside my bed. “She’s got people with her. I’ll stay until you’ve had your wounds treated.”

He reached out and gently brushed the hair from my forehead. The gesture was soft… familiar. But I simply stared at him, calm and distant, the spark I once felt for him completely gone.

He belonged to someone else now—Carrie’s mate.

Her husband.

He had marked her behind my back—sealed the mate bond. From that moment on, there was no going back for us.

“Does it hurt?” he asked softly, brows drawn together.

I shook my head lightly.

Hurt? Of course it did. 

My skin was splitting, rough like cracked bark, every breeze stinging like acid.

But none of that compared to the pain inside.

The healer arrived quickly, tending to my burns with the utmost care. Every touch was like a knife, but I didn’t make a sound—I bit down and bore it. I didn’t want to scream. My wolf wouldn’t allow me to break down in front of them.

Outside the door, Carrie’s overly sweet voice rang out, “Christian! Come see the dolphins! They’re so beautiful!”

He hesitated, then finally stood and helped me up. “Come with me. Let’s go take a look.”

I didn’t refuse. Didn’t have the strength to.

Out on the deck, the sea shimmered gold beneath the setting sun. A pod of dolphins leapt from the water, their graceful arcs slicing through the waves like something out of a dream.

Carrie clasped her hands and closed her eyes like a child making a wish. “Hurry! Make a wish! I heard if you wish while watching dolphins, it always comes true!”

He laid me gently onto a lounge chair. I sat there, surrounded by faces I once knew—now strangers.

They all closed their eyes, too. People who never believed in this kind of thing, now silently making wishes like devoted believers.

I knew every wish in their he@rts… was for her.

I closed my eyes too.

I could feel my wolf growling within me, desperate to break free, to destroy everything, to make them all pay. But I was calmer than her.

I knew I had to survive, to leave this ship, to cut every last tie to my past.

“Blair, what did you wish for?” Carrie leaned over, whispering in my ear—sweet, soft, and enough to make my skin crawl.

The four men turned to me as well.

I opened my eyes and looked at all five of them—faces once dear to me, now nothing but poison.

Then I spoke, clear and slow, 

“My wish… is to never see Christian, Lysander, Orion, Zayden, or Carrie… ever again.”",1,1754538649.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False
1mjpudo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1mjpudo/from_getting_burned_on_olx_to_saying_screw_it_ill/,"From getting burned on OLX to saying ""screw it, I'll build my own"" 🚀","So here's a fun story that'll probably sound familiar to way too many of you.

A few months back, I'm trying to sell some stuff on OLX. This buyer slides into my DMs, seems totally normal. We're chatting, they're asking all the right questions, even haggling a bit (which honestly made them seem more real). 

Then comes the ""payment"" - a crisp screenshot showing the money transferred to my account. Looks legit, right? Wrong. Turns out these scammers have gotten really, really good at faking payment confirmations. By the time I figured it out, my stuff was gone and so was my faith in online marketplaces.

I was pissed. Not just about the money - though that stung - but about how these platforms basically throw you to the wolves. Anyone can create an account with a random number, no questions asked, and boom - they're in business ruining other people's day.

That's when the lightbulb went off (probably more like a frustrated rage-bulb, but whatever):

What if we only let people in who actually have something to lose?

Enter TrustCart - where you can only sign up with your work email. Yep, your actual, official, ""this-is-tied-to-my-paycheck"" email address. Suddenly, scamming someone isn't just about creating a new account when you get caught. It's about potentially messing with your professional reputation.

I'm starting small - really small. Just rolling it out to my own office first because, let's be honest, if my coworkers won't use something I built, why would strangers? The goal is stupidly simple: get 50 things listed and see what happens. If people start buying and selling, they'll tell their work friends. Those friends will tell their work friends. That's the dream, anyway.

Look, I know this isn't revolutionary. I'm just one person with a laptop, building this in whatever free time I can scrape together. No fancy office, no investors breathing down my neck, no team of developers - just me, way too much coffee, and the burning desire to never get scammed again.

The thing is, I keep thinking about all the times I've hesitated to buy something online because I wasn't sure if the seller was legit. Or all the stuff sitting in my closet that I'd love to sell but can't be bothered dealing with sketchy buyers. Maybe I'm not the only one?

If you've ever gotten burned on these platforms, or even just felt that little knot in your stomach when dealing with random sellers, I'd love to know I'm not crazy for thinking there's a better way.

You can check out what I've built so far at trustcart.co.in - fair warning, it's still pretty rough around the edges, but it works.

And hey, if this whole thing crashes and burns, at least I'll have learned how to build a marketplace. That's something, right?

P.S. Our motto is basically ""we don't do anonymous, we do accountable"" - which sounds way cooler than ""please don't scam people, we know where you work.""",0,1754538593.0,bangalore,43,0.5,False

Furthermore, in the legend of aang we have a journey to learn about the three elements since he already dominated the air, while in korra she dominates all three except air. In Aang we have a firebending villain, while in Korra we have a waterbending villain, an earthbender and an airbender. Both works fit together like perfect opposites. 

Wagnaria: the first work shows two protagonists who work in a coffee shop, and the spin off too. But while the first balances nonsensical humor with genuinely adorable and emotional romanticism, the spin off focuses more on acidic humor. And the best part is that in the original they learn to relate and date at the end of the work, while in the spin off the protagonists date very early in the story and begin to learn to relate. The gender dynamics are also opposite, the male protagonist of the sequel is much less sensitive and vulnerable than his predecessor ",4,1754538504.0,TopCharacterTropes,0,1.0,False

  Max  
  
  The dishes were done, the flat tidied, and Sara had begun to sing quietly to our little miss in the nursery. I said a simple prayer to the god of sleeping children, because on her way in there, Sara had given me the look.  
  
  The don’t fall asleep before I come to bed look.  
  
  The I’m still not over the sight of our baby sleeping on your naked chest look.  
  
  The you’re getting very, extremely laid look.  
  
  I fucking loved my life.  
  
  Across the room on the coffee table, my phone lit up with a call. Going over and seeing whose name flashed across the screen, I broke out in a massive smile.  
  
  “You’ve called the happiest bloke on the planet,” I told my brother, in lieu of a proper greeting.  
  
  I was met with a heavy pause of silence, and then: “It’s impossible for you to be smugger.”  
  
  “True. But make it quick. I’m about to be ravaged by the natives.” Sweet mother Mary it seemed like it’d been forever since we’d had anything more than a quick grope en route to passing out from exhaustion.  
  
  I was even considering doing some extensive stretching first.  
  
  My youngest brother, Niall, laughed. “In that case, I hope you survive the night because I’m coming to visit next week and I’d be terribly disappointed to miss the Max Stella tour you’ve promised all these years.”  
  
  “Brilliant!” I smacked the table with my palm. This night kept getting better. The promise of sex two nights in a row with my gorgeous wife and a visit from my brother next week. “Absolutely, bloody brilliant.” I hadn’t seen Niall since the last time I went home, over a year ago, and he’d been too busy to visit much. “Work letting you out, then?”  
  
  “More or less.” He paused. “Right. That’s it, then, it’s bloodly late. Just letting you know. I’m coming to visit little Annabel, not you lot.”  
  
  Laughing, I said, “Understood.”  
  
  “I’ll arrive on Tuesday. Leaving Sunday.”  
  
  I noted the rest of the details and rang off before heading to find Sara to share the news.  
  
  The singing had stopped, and to my complete lack of surprise, I found my beautiful wife asleep in the rocking chair beside the crib, with the baby in her arms. I pulled the little Beloved away from her mum, swaddled her up, and placed her in the crib. Although until recently Annabel generally slept only two or three hours at a time, at least we could put her to bed beside a brass band and she wouldn’t rouse.  
  
  I suspected we wouldn’t be as lucky with the next one.  
  
  Next one?  
  
  I blinked, feeling slightly mad for having this thought. It was only in the past two weeks that we were getting any sort of decent sleep at all.  
  
  With the baby taken care of, I crossed the room to wake Sara. Her eyes drew open just as I reached her, and she inhaled deeply, blinking up at me. “Oh. I fell asleep.”  
  
  I crouched in front of her, using my thumb to move a strand of hair off her face. “I don’t think you were supposed to do that.”  
  
  “No, I was going to get you naked.”  
  
  “That’s still an option.”  
  
  Sara took my hand and stood, pulling me after her out of the nursery and down the hall. “What were you thinking, just standing there looking down at me?”  
  
  “Just feeling rather in love with my life, is all.”  
  
  “Well, I fell asleep wondering whether our second will be as good a sleeper as our first.”  
  
  She glanced over her shoulder at me with a grin, and I gaped at her, eyes wide and incredulous. How could she know the exact thought had crossed my mind only minutes before?  
  
  “You call Anna a good sleeper?” I asked.  
  
  “She has been lately,” she clarified. “We just had to give her time to grow into it.”  
  
  I watched Sara’s hair slide over her shoulders as she turned back and shook her head. Her hair was longer now, thicker, and the way it slid across her skin made me want to gather it into a ball, hold it in my fist, and fuck her over the side of the bed.  
  
  Oh, but it had been forever since we’d done anything as rough as that.  
  
  I swallowed, closed my eyes, and attempted to steady my hunger when she sat on the edge of the mattress and slowly slid her thighs apart.  
  
  “You’ve lost your mind,” I said with a grin.  
  
  “Probably true.” Her sexy little shrug told me she was only half serious, and a naughty playfulness lingered beneath the surface.  
  
  Stepping between her legs, I helped her pull her tank top over her head and guided her onto her back so I could slide her thin cotton shorts down and off.  
  
  Slow, Max.  
  
  My mind frenzied with thoughts of pushing her thighs to her chest, biting my way down her torso, sucking and spanking the sweetness between her legs until she screamed so loud it shook the walls. Instead, I kissed her navel, her hip, moving my mouth to her ribs and then up higher to the firm swell of her breasts. They were already full, and growing tight the longer the baby slept. I bent, sucking at the pink flush of her nipples.  
  
  “Do you really love to look at them so much?” Her voice dropped slightly. “You like the taste?”  
  
  I loved her body like this, but I didn’t know how to truly admit it. I loved her hips, her breasts. Loved to watch her feed our baby and come curl around me after. It felt like every fucking thing in the world had come together with the arrival of our daughter. But it still felt a bit shameful to want her body to stay this way after what had admittedly been a tough labor.  
  
  I shifted forward carefully, pressing my cock through my boxers into the warm skin between her legs.  
  
  Sara pulled me down over her and slid her mouth down my neck. “Is it weird that I want to stay like this?” she asked as I spread my hand over her hip. “To fill this home of ours with little ankle biters?”  
  
  I laughed into her shoulder. “Sleep deprivation is eating your brain.”  
  
  “I know you want a big family,” she said. “And I’ve never been more in love with you than when I’ve seen you be a daddy . . .” She noticed where my attention had gone, to the firm swell of her breast again, my mouth closing over her nipple. “They get full like this . . .”  
  
  I kissed my way up to her neck. “They provide me with a rather spiritual experience.”  
  
  “So you do like my body right now?” she whispered.  
  
  There was a delicate edge to her voice, a vulnerability that shocked me. Sara knew I loved her body, every inch of her perfect, soft skin.  
  
  Didn’t she?  
  
  I pulled back to look at her. “I fucking love your body. And I love how happy motherhood has made you. I like how you seem rather blissful lately.” Bending, I spoke into the warm space between her breasts: “I also like how ripe your tits are.”  
  
  She took a handful of my hair and pulled me back, laughing. “Finally, he admits it!”  
  
  “What does that mean?”  
  
  Her brow furrowed a little as she studied my face, warm brown eyes moving to take in every aspect of my expression. Sara often studied me like this: quietly, earnestly. She ran a fingertip across my chin, her eyes trained on my lips. “I want you to not worry so much,” she whispered. “I want more babies—maybe not right away, but someday—and when I say that, I see terror in your eyes.”  
  
  I swallowed around the heavy lump in my throat. “It’s not as hard on my body.”  
  
  “My body seems to be weathering it fine. I’m going back to work soon. Look at us. We did it.”  
  
  I bent, tasting her skin again. Kissing her stomach.  
  
  She pulled me up, whispered in my ear, “Tell me you didn’t love having your baby in here.”  
  
  Laughing, I admitted, “She was certainly easier to  
take care of all tucked away in there.”  
  
  She looked back up at my face as I shifted over her, spreading her thighs with my knee and settling there, growing tighter at the feel of her, soft and warm, beneath me. “All right, love?”  
  
  Her breaths were already coming faster, short bursts against my neck, her hands sliding lower over my back to push my boxers down my hips. “Yeah.”  
  
  I slipped my finger into her mouth, wetting it against her tongue before bringing it between us to touch her. I hummed, rubbing myself on her thigh. “You sure? You’re not sore?”  
  
  She stared up at me, expression shifting into one I couldn’t quite read. “I’m sure.”  
  
  “We made love last night, too. I don’t want to hurt you,” I explained.  
  
  She closed her eyes, pulling my head into her neck. “I know, baby.”  
  
  I slid in, slow, and pressed my mouth to her jaw, groaning. Each time . . . each fucking time I was sure I would never get used to the feel of her. Her nails dug into my back as she let out a relieved moan.  
  
  “Christ, Petal. You’re heaven beneath me.” Cupping her breast in one hand, I squeezed, relishing the slide of milk on my palm. “Fuck,” I managed. “Fucking hell . . .”  
  
  “This is a new thing,” she whispered, scratching her nails down my back.  
  
  I clenched my jaw, fighting the admission that wanted to burst free. “I bloody love them like this. I’m sorry—I know they’re mostly a drag for you—but fuck, Petal. I love your tits like this.”  
  
  I felt her still beneath me and stopped moving so I could pull back and look at her face.  
  
  “What?” I asked. “What did I say?”  
  
  She didn’t look upset, just a funny mix of disappointed and amused. Sliding her legs up my sides, she whispered, “Since when do you have to give me a disclaimer?”  
  
  Smiling, I bent and kissed her sweet, full lips. My heart was beating a little too fast; I still wasn’t sure what I’d done wrong.  
  
  “You don’t have to apologize for being turned on by that,” she whispered into my mouth. “I miss seeing you lost in me, and unapologetic about it.”  
  
  My immediate instinct was to show her how lost I really was: to lift her arms over her head, pound into her, and relish the sight of her breasts moving below me, relish their weight and the spike of lust I felt when they leaked onto my skin. But instead, I began to slowly move above her, making sure to ease her pleasure from her with every draw of my body inside hers.  
  
  She grabbed my ass, urged me faster and harder, and I tried to give her more but it was almost like something newly hardwired in me with every shift forward:  
  
  Take it easy.  
  
  Take it slow.  
  
  Take it easy.  
  
  Take it slow.  
  
  We’d had sex many times in the months since the baby was born, but it hadn’t yet returned to the wild days of before, with fucking on the kitchen table or the floor, or sweaty and reckless play in the club. Those days we’d had spanking and bondage. Those days I’d taken her in every manner imaginable, sometimes with strangers watching, sometimes with only my video camera as witness. Once I’d bit her shoulder so hard she’d bled and it nearly made her savage with excitement.  
  
  Before—and during—her pregnancy, it never occurred to me how fragile she was.  
  
  And then she’d had my baby: nearly nine pounds and over twenty-four hours of hard labor. For two months after Annabel came, we’d stumbled our way through new parenting, fallen in love with our daughter, fallen in love all over again with each other, and found tiny winks of sleep whenever we could. Eventually, we’d also found ways to be carefully intimate with hands and mouths, playful with words and toys.  
  
  Then, nearly two months ago now, Sara said she was ready to make love again.  
  
  I’d been terrified at first, but one kiss led to another, and soon I’d been harder than I could remember being in weeks. The sound she made when I pushed into her would forever echo in my thoughts. It was a broken sound, the sharp, surprised cry of pain. I’d immediately stopped, and although she swore she felt no pain now, I couldn’t help but feel I was handling her differently: being careful with a treasure I’d only recently discovered could be broken . . .  
  
  We had yet to return to the club.  
  
  We had yet to even pull out the camera for anything other than pictures of our daughter.  
  
  We had yet to have sex that did anything more than rustle the sheets, let alone break furniture.  
  
  But here, in our bed, with her beneath me, and making her hungry, gasping little noises, her words echoed in my head—pounding—each one like a mallet hitting a drum.  
  
  I miss seeing you lost in me, and unapologetic about it.  
  
  She was letting me be gentle. She was patiently waiting for it to sink in that she’d asked for more, for real sex, again and again.  
  
  She’d say, Do you want to make a movie tonight?  
  
  No, Petal, it’s enough just to feel you.  
  
  Do you ever miss the club?  
  
  No, Petal, I love being right here where we are, with our baby asleep down the hall.  
  
  You really like to look at them like this? You like the taste?  
  
  I’d wanted to make things easy for her. I’d wanted her to feel safe and cherished. I closed my eyes, absorbed by the paradoxical sensations of relief when Sara began to quietly come beneath be, and heartache in the realization that somewhere along the line, I had forgotten what she needed.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  At four in the morning, I sat on the floor of the nursery while Sara fed Annabel. The sky outside was deep blue-black, and even on the Upper East Side at this hour, the streets were relatively quiet.  
  
  “You didn’t have to get up with us,” she whispered.  
  
  She said the same thing every morning, worried about my lack of sleep and a long workday ahead. But this, right here, was my favorite part of the day.  
  
  “I’ll bundle her up and go for a run when you’re done.”  
  
  Sara watched me in the darkness. “I love you.”  
  
  I swallowed, nodding as I struggled to work past the lump in my throat so I could repeat the sentiment. I’d barely been able to sleep last night after realizing I’d been so focused on enjoying Sara the Mother that I’d barely let myself enjoy Sara the Woman.  
  
  “What’s wrong?” she whispered, watching me struggle.  
  
  “I think we need to make a deal to return to us before we can get pregnant again.”  
  
  “ ‘Us’?” she repeated.  
  
  “I think I heard what you were saying last night.”  
  
  Her brows pulled together and I could tell she wasn’t exactly sure what I was saying. “Oh?”  
  
  “I want to be the husband you need again. Photographs. Film. Knowing I’m giving you what you need.”  
  
  “What I need?”  
  
  “What we need.”  
  
  She licked her lips, blinking down to the baby. “You’re so much more than I could have ever hoped for. You know that.”  
  
  “I’d like to occasionally outdo myself,” I said, and she giggled, putting her hand over her mouth when the baby pulled off her breast in surprise.  
  
  “Shh, shh,” Sara murmured to her. “Come here.”  
  
  “Maybe Mum can watch little Beloved and we can start with dinner out? Slowly work our way to something else?”  
  
  She looked up again, eyes wide. “Like the club?”  
  
  I watched her holding our child in her arms and felt a protectiveness so violent lash over me I wasn’t sure how I would handle letting others see her so vulnerable, so ripe.  
  
  “If that’s what you want,” I managed.  
  
  She nodded, gently answering the question in my voice. “It is.”  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  I folded up the stroller and stowed it in the foyer closet before stripping off my shirt. Although so far it had been a mild winter, it was still January and the long-sleeved running shirt I wore to keep me from freezing outside immediately felt claustrophobic upon entering the warm apartment.  
  
  Bending, I unzipped the carrier and pulled out the extremely bundled child inside.  
\>  
  “Was that good, baby girl?” I murmured, kissing her pink cheek. She was warm and drooly and her enormous brown eyes crinkled exactly like her mother’s when she smiled. “Got a good run in, didn’t we?”  
  
  I sat on the couch and laid Annabel on my chest while I caught my breath.  
  
  “You’re sweaty and sitting on the couch, aren’t you?” Sara called from the master suite.  
  
  I stuck my tongue out at Anna and she tried to grab it. “Very sweaty,” I answered my wife. “Quite disgusting, actually.”  
  
  Sara’s heels clicked down the hallway and she froze when she saw us. “Max.”  
  
  “I’ll wipe it down, Pet—”  
  
  “I don’t care about that,” she said, walking closer. “You’re shirtless with the world’s sweetest baby cuddled on those muscles. Put a shirt on, you beast, or I can’t be held responsible for my actions.”  
  
  I fucking loved it when Sara looked at me like that. “Imagine how I feel when you’re feeding her.”  
  
  She gave me a bright smile as she bent, kissing Anna’s chubby thigh. “She looks like a little peach on you.”  
  
  I took in her outfit and immediately wondered if we’d be able to get the baby down for a nap this early in the day. I hadn’t seen Sara in work clothes in months and didn’t realize until just then how much I missed it. Her little black skirt hit just below her knees, giving a tiny flash of skin above her soft leather boots. Her tits looked fucking unreal in the gray sweater she’d put on.  
  
  Following my attention, she looked down at her chest. “I think I need to go shopping today. Everything is too small in the chest.”  
  
  “Don’t you dare get rid of that one.”  
  
  She pulled her lip between her teeth, blinking over to me. “Yeah?”  
  
  “Yeah,” I murmured, and the moment grew heavy. “You look bloody beautiful, Petal.”  
  
  “Is it . . . inappropriate, though? I mean, the way you’re looking at me makes me think this sweater is no longer very professional.”  
  
  “I guess it depends on where you’re headed.”  
  
  She shrugged, sitting down next to us. “I thought I’d go into the office for a couple of hours, just so next week doesn’t feel so disorienting. I’m meeting the girls for breakfast and then heading in.

  I kissed the top of Anna’s head. “Want me to take her with me?”  
  
  “Either way. I could, too.”  
  
  What was it about her face in that moment, right there, that made me feel so many things at once it was overwhelming? With her dressed and headed out the door, it was like I was seeing this combination for the first time: my lover, my wife, and also a mother, a nurturer and . . . fuck, a bird with the best pair of tits I’d ever seen.  
  
  Standing, I motioned for her to follow me back down the hall. I grabbed Annabel’s musical baby seat from the nursery and put it beside the dresser in our bedroom, facing the set of framed photographs of trees that she loved, and then guided Sara to the bed.  
  
  “Max . . .”  
  
  “Just a minute.” I retrieved my camera from the shelf, stabilized it on the tripod, and set it to automatic shots every five seconds. Sara’s breath was rapid and shallow when I bent low, kissed her neck, and told her, “I won’t keep you long.”  
  
  “Anna’s fine,” she said, pulling me closer. “Keep me as long as you can.”  
  
  Laying her back, I pushed her skirt up her hips and began kissing my way up her stomach, feeling my cock tighten with each nostalgic click of the shutter, with the feel of her hands digging into my hair. I moved her sweater up her stomach, revealing smooth, bare skin. She tasted like rain, like fruit, and had the same sweet scent I’d always worshipped on her body. Reaching behind her, I unhooked her bra and pushed it up over her breasts.  
  
  I’d always loved Sara’s breasts but I’d never particularly been a breast man until recently. The weight of them, the soft smell of her skin, and the odd spike I felt in my abdomen whenever she fed our child . . . it was an odd reflex to want to look at them, touch them like this, and one I realized I’d been fighting the last few months.  
  
  You don’t have to apologize for being turned on by that.  
  
  My mouth closed over the peak, tongue pulling her deeper into my mouth, and I groaned at the feel of it. She was warm and firm, so full—  
  
  I did this . . .  
  
  I made her this way  
  
  —and when she reached for my track pants and pushed them down my hips to take me in her hand, the moment dissolved into frenzy.  
  
  I could imagine her looking through the pictures later, seeing how much I relished the feel of her in my mouth, the taste of her on my tongue. She would know, then, just by looking at my face, how I loved the slide of milk on my hand, the way her hips looked spread around mine. I worshipped her.  
  
  I bloody worshipped this woman.  
  
  I rocked into her fist, groaning at the feel of her mouth sucking at my neck, her desperate, sweet little cries into my skin. Shoving her panties aside, I licked my hand and used it to make her slick so I could push deep inside with one sharp stab of my hips.  
  
  She gasped, eyes wide with thrill and relieved—fuck, she was relieved, as if I’d been missing and maybe I had. I pulled out and shifted forward, fucking her so hard and fast that within the span of a minute I knew I was coming; coming before I had time to get her there, before I even had time to consider whether she wanted me to spill inside her before leaving for work. I just . . . wanted with such intensity, with a kind of jagged need I hadn’t felt in so long that I couldn’t seem to slow myself down.  
  
  The tenderness and protectiveness had been pushed aside, just for the moment, by something older and familiar: a heavy need to claim her.  
  
  I reached between us, playing with her with my fingertips until she was bucking into my hand, gasping and squeezing around my cock. She cried out, three sharp pleas to drag her through her pleasure, and then she fell quiet, pulling me fully on top of her and exhaling heavily into my neck.  
  
  She’d seen me every day; we’d cuddled, talked, laughed, fallen asleep at the dinner table together, and done all manner of intimate things. But the relief in this moment was profound. I knew exactly what she meant when she whispered, “I missed you.”  
  
  And all I could say back was “I missed you, too.”  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Mum was already at her desk when I arrived at the office wearing Annabel in the carrier. She jumped up, ran around the desk, and reached for her granddaughter without even looking at my face.  
  
  “Mum,” I hissed, laughing as I reached for her shoulders so she wouldn’t jostle the baby. “She’s asleep. Settle down, woman. You’ll get her in a bit when I’ve got a meeting with Levinson.”  
  
  My mother looked up at me and replaced her mild scowl with a sweet smile. “Mornin’, love.”  
  
  I’d never seen myself as a mum’s boy growing up but having her with us at Stella & Sumner for the past several years was one of my favorite things about coming to work. Especially since we’d had Annabel, I appreciated the proximity of family and their ability to tell us when we were acting like neurotic idiots.  
  
  And although Mum had raised ten of us quite capably, I registered I was due for a sizable heap of shit when I asked her—for the first time—to watch the baby so we could go out. We’d always taken the baby with us, but this was . . . well, this was entirely different.  
  
  “Mum,” I started as she walked back around her desk to sit down. “I was hoping to take Sara out this coming Friday. Would you mind heading over and watching Annabel?”  
  
  Her face fell. “Max, you forgot.”  
  
  I groaned. Fuck. This was the second time a woman had said this to me in less than twenty-four hours. “Forgot what?”  
  
  “I leave for Leeds tomorrow, dove. I’m going to stay with Karen for three weeks.”  
  
  “Aw, bugger.”  
  
  “I can watch her tonight?”  
  
  “No, you’ve got to pack and we don’t have any sort of plan in place. I get the sense we’ll both need this to be a military operation.”  
  
  “You’re mental. I’ve been telling you for weeks: just take the wife out and have some dinner, for crying out loud. By the time you and Niall and Rebecca came along, we were letting the dog watch you for a night out.”  
  
  Laughing, I agreed, “I don’t doubt it.”  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  “The fuck are you wearing?”  
  
  I looked down at Annabel still asleep in the carrier and replied to Will, “It’s called an Ergo.”  
  
  He followed me into my office and sat on my couch. “It looks like you went tandem skydiving and forgot to unlatch.”  
  
  Bennett walked up behind him. “You look like a marsupial.”  
  
  “It’s called baby wearing, you twats.” I laughed, and then whispered to the baby, “Is that right? Are you my little joey?” I looked up at my mates and only then did I do the mental calculation. “Bennett, what the hell are you doing here?”  
  
  “Will and I had a meeting with Gross and Barrett at eight. Did you forget?”  
  
  “Bloody hell will you lot cut me some slack! I’ve not slept in four fucking months!”  
  
  They both stared at me, wide-eyed, for several silent seconds.  
  
  “Are your nipples sore?” Will asked.  
  
  I shook my head, laughing. “Tosser.”  
  
  As carefully as I could, I unhooked the carrier behind my neck and let it fall so I could lay Anna down on the couch beside Will. She startled—both arms and both legs flying out in a spasm—but then immediately fell back asleep.  
  
  For his part, Will looked like I’d just put a giant hollow eggshell near him. His hands were clasped in his lap and his eyes were trained on the baby as if she might suddenly roll and explode. He’d been around Anna nearly every weekend since she’d been born and still looked at her like breathing too heavily near her might cause her to shatter.  
  
  “Since when are you an idiot around children?” I asked.  
  
  “I love kids,” he said, looking up at me. “But she’s just so little.”  
  
  “She’s not,” I assured him. “She’s enormous.”  
  
  “You know what I mean.”  
  
  “Look,” I said, sitting down in a chair near my desk. “I need to ask a favor. I want to take Sare out for dinner this Friday—”  
  
  Bennett interrupted: “You’re finally going to let someon  
e watch Anna?”  
  
  Scowling, I explained, “It’s a lot easier said than done, right? Anyway, Mum is leaving for Leeds tomorrow so she can’t watch her this weekend. Can one of you . . . ?”  
  
  They both stared at me with terrified eyes.  
  
  “Aw come on, it’s not that hard. We’d only go out for a few hours. You and your better half give her a couple of bottles, change a couple of diapers, she sleeps, we get home.”  
  
  “We can’t,” Bennett said, wincing in apology. “Chloe and I are headed up to the Hudson Valley.”  
  
  “This weekend?” Will asked, nodding several times in quick succession as if to talk himself into it. “I could probably do it.”  
  
  “Brilliant,” I said. “Thanks, mate.”  
  
  “I’ve never changed a diaper. Or fed a baby. Hanna jokes that the only girl I’ve ever failed to charm is Liv’s daughter, Aspen.” Shrugging, he added, “But I’m sure it’s instinct, right?” He ticked the rules off on his fingers: “Don’t scald Anna in the bath, don’t leave the milk in the microwave too long.” He paused and seemed to continue to draft a mental list. “Oh, and don’t drop her.”  
  
  I imagined walking out of the office right now and leaving Annabel in Will’s hands for even a minute; my stomach flipped over and I wanted to vomit. “Couldn’t you bring Hanna?”  
  
  “She’s got some visiting-faculty dinners this weekend.”  
  
  Rubbing my hand across my chin, I asked, “You know . . . maybe you could come over and have dinner with us tonight to watch and learn?”  
  
  He nodded, but swallowed heavily. To be fair, I knew what I was asking was a big deal. It was one thing to hang out with us when we had Annabel, and quite another to imagine being alone with this tiny little girl.  
  
  “Can’t you just take it to the restaurant with you?” Bennett asked.  
  
  “That sort of defeats the purpose. Also, Annabel isn’t an ‘it.’ ”  
  
  “I didn’t call her an ‘it.’ ”  
  
  Will and I replied in unison, “Yeah, you did.”  
  
  Scrubbing my face, I muttered, “Fuck it. Just come over for dinner and we’ll have some beers.”  
  
  We’d figure something out. We had to.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  Sara  
  
  I turned down Fifty-Sixth and caught sight of the Parker Meridien near the end of the block.  
  
  The gray stone façade was as bleak as the morning sky; the clouds overhead fat with snow that was certain to start falling any minute. Winter in New York after Christmas was dreary: cold and wet, dirty slush, and days at a time without a hint of blue sky. But this year had been blessedly mild compared to others, and warm enough for Max to regularly push the bundled-up stroller alongside Will and Hanna as they ran through the park.  
  
  My phone buzzed in the front pocket of my coat. I didn’t need to look to know it was Chloe, sending the third Where are you? You are not backing out on us Sara! message in the last hour. So maybe I’d missed a few lunches with the girls since Anna had been born, it wasn’t easy getting out of the house with a newborn who would be permanently attached to my breast if given the chance.  
  
  I ignored my phone, my head still full of my morning with Max. Chloe could wait.  
  
  But of course only two steps later I was clutched with the fear that maybe the text hadn’t been Chloe. Maybe it was Max with a message that Anna was sick or had hurt herself or—  
  
  I moved off the sidewalk to stand in the shelter of a nearby building, and pulled out my phone.  
  
  Will might come over for dinner, Max had written. You good with that?  
  
  I replied that it was fine and slid my phone back into my pocket. With each step, my favorite boots crunched through the salt that had been scattered along the sidewalk. Chloe wanted to take me shopping before I braved the office today, but I’d declined. I wanted the comfort of my favorite skirt and the heels that added just a little swing to my step, the sweater that rendered Max speechless and then consumed this morning. I needed to feel like myself.  
  
  I straightened my jacket and tightened the grip on the purse Max had bought me for my birthday. A Burberry clutch, not a diaper bag. I hadn’t been out of the house without my baby, let alone diapers, bottles, wipes, and a change of clothes, since Anna was born, and the soft leather felt too light in my hand.  
  
  Just a few hours away from her today, I reminded myself. Just see how it goes.  
  
  I smiled at the doorman as I stepped inside the marble lobby. The floors were gleaming white and inlaid with glossy black squares, the walls made of polished stone. People gathered on benches and sat hunched over their phones. Conversations carried through the giant space and up, echoing off stone walls. I walked under a giant arch and turned left, climbing a set of stairs that led to Norma’s. As usual, I could hear Chloe before I could see her.  
  
  “There she is,” Chloe said, standing on skyscraper-tall boots, all long legs and cascading wavy hair and an expression that said there was no way I’d get out of being late without getting a little shit for it first. “Fucking finally.”  
  
  “I know, I know,” I said, crossing the wood floors to reach them. “Sorry. Just trust me that time warps when you have a kid, and you think you’re getting out of the house on time and then suddenly you’re half an hour late.”  
  
  “Are you sure it wasn’t because Max saw you in that outfit and got a little handsy?” Hanna asked from beside Chloe.  
  
  “Spoken like a woman who’s with a boob man,” I said, laughing. “And . . . maybe.”  
  
  I adored Hanna, but Max in particular had grown especially fond of her in the past year, saying that anyone who could keep Will Sumner by the balls was aces in his book.  
  
  “Just ignore Attila the Hun over here,” my assistant and good friend George said, motioning to Chloe. “The woman isn’t happy unless she’s bossing someone around.”  
  
  “Hell yes,” Chloe said.  
  
  I hugged them all and hung my coat on the back of my chair before taking my seat.  
  
  “How’s the princess?” Chloe said, blowing over the top of her mug. “Where’s the princess?”  
  
  “Perfect. She’s with Daddy today.” A proud smile spread across my face. “How’s the Bennett?”  
  
  “A nightmare,” she answered, equally proud.  
  
  “And what’s new with you and Will?” I asked, turning to Hanna. “I feel like I hardly see you, even if Max has taken it upon himself to crash your runs lately. Sorry about that.”  
  
  Hanna leaned an elbow on the table and smiled. “I love when he comes along. And judging by the goofy look Will gets on his face when he sees that running stroller heading down the path, I can assure you he doesn’t mind, either.”  
  
  “Good, because as bad as I feel, the extra hour of sleep I get makes me feel a lot better.”  
  
  “Maybe I should join those runs,” George offered. “Does Will run shirtless in the spring?”  
  
  “George,” Hanna said, ignoring this, “are you going to tell Sara about the little dreamboat you’ve been seeing?”  
  
  “Was seeing,” he corrected. “As in past tense. Ugh, it was a stage-one breakup. I don’t want to talk about it.”  
  
  “A stage what?” Chloe asked.  
  
  “A stage one,” he clarified. “I swear, do I always have to be the gay urban dictionary for you people? Stage one is where you break up via text message trying to come off not looking like a total douche bag. Stage two is where you tell the person, ‘Look, you’re not ringing my bell and I’m clearly not ringing yours. Let’s move this train along to grander stations.’ Stage three is where it’s not working and you sort of fade the person out over time. It’s painful because by then the other person has become sort of a habit. They know how you take your coffee and what days you can have carbs and just . . . it can be sad.”  
  
  “Of course it can,” I said, stirring my coffee. “Bonding over dietary restrictions can be very romantic.”  
  
  George gave me a playful jab to the shoulder. “You get a sarcasm pass because you’re lactating and it’s clearly eating your brain. Where was I? Oh, stage four. Well . . . stage four  
is where one person is totally invested and the other is just . . . over it. Awful, right? So, stage one doesn’t sound so bad, but in my opinion it’s the worst after stage four. If someone feels comfortable breaking up via text message, you clearly haven’t gotten to a place where you can ask a lot of questions, and you definitely can’t call them up and be all Oh hi, it’s me, the guy you wore the Lion Tamer outfit with? Can you tell me what happened?”  
  
  We all nodded sympathetically, and George glared at the bowl of muffins in the center of the table before reaching for one. “Now I’m eating my feelings.”  
  
  “Aww, George. Were you totally infatuated with him?” Hanna asked.  
  
  “Oh, girl, no,” George said with a laugh. “I don’t do infatuation unless his name is Sumner.”  
  
  The waiter stopped by our table, filling my coffee before taking each of our orders. “I’ll have the crispy waffle with berries and Devonshire cream,” I told him.  
  
  “I have no idea how you look like this,” Chloe said, motioning to my body, “and still eat like that. You don’t run with Hanna, and I know I haven’t seen you at the office gym in months.”  
  
  “One of the joys of breastfeeding,” I said. “I have to eat more calories to keep up my milk.”  
  
  Which was true. I still worked out when I could, but pregnancy and motherhood had left me with this new body I was only now getting used to: a slightly wider waist, but curves that had never been so full. I’d always been a bit on the skinny side, but I felt softer now, with rounded hips and boobs that surprised even me. It didn’t hurt that sometimes I’d turn around and see Max flat-out staring at my chest, completely unable to look away. I’d be lying if I didn’t say those moments made me feel like a fucking queen.  
  
  “What’s the plan when you go back to work?” Hanna asked, and taking in my outfit, added, “I’m assuming that’s where you’re headed now?”  
  
  I nodded as I took a sip of my coffee. “I don’t officially go back until next week, but thought it might be easier to ease myself into it.”  
  
  “Are you actually going to walk into your office and sit at your desk today?” George asked. George had been a godsend while I was on leave. I was out for sixteen weeks, but I’d never wanted to feel disconnected from my career at Ryan Media Group, so I’d stop in on a pretty regular basis even though anything I needed to look at could have easily been couriered over to the apartment. Without really talking about it, we’d built up a system: Anna and I would meet George at his desk in the outer office, he’d hand me the stack of files and any messages that required my attention, and I’d leave him whatever I’d been working on at home.  
  
  I never went inside my office and he never questioned why.  
  
  Which was ridiculous, when you thought about it. I was Sara Stella, capable of managing multimillion-dollar campaigns and overseeing an entire finance department.  
  
  But I hadn’t quite figured out how to do all that and be mommy, too.  
  
  “You haven’t gone into your office yet?” Hanna asked. “Is it going to be weird to go back?”  
  
  “I don’t think so? I mean, I want to go back to work. I need to. It’s such a part of who I am and I need that part of my life. But Anna . . . the idea of leaving her for eight hours a day still fills me with this guilt like I’m ruining her somehow or I’m missing some vital mommy muscle that makes me want to stay home. Plus, I know I want more at some point and how will we make all that work? Is it fair of me to want more children when I’m pretty sure I’ll always need that side of me, too?”  
  
  “Bullshit,” Chloe said. “You think men ever have this conversation with themselves? Of course they don’t. You’ve killed yourself to get where you are. If you can have both, have both. It might take some adjustment but who cares? You figure it out as you go.” She tilted her head and added, “You don’t see Max wanting to stay home.”  
  
  “Actually,” I started, and it was enough to get Chloe’s attention. She put down her mug and sat back in her chair, waiting. “I don’t really know what’s going on with him right now. I know he wants me every bit as much as he did before Anna, but I think it’s been more of an adjustment for him than he thought it would be, the idea of my being a wife and a mother. He’s so careful, like he’s not sure how to treat me.”  
  
  “Can you blame the man?” George said, and we all turned to him. “Have you seen what childbirth does to a vagina?” He did a full-body shudder.

  It’s too damn cold of a day to be out on a hunt.  
  
  I shiver, tug my scarf up higher over my mouth, and wipe a few snowflakes from my lashes. Then I slam my boot down on my electric skateboard. The board is old and used, like everything else I own, its blue paint almost entirely scraped off to reveal cheap silver plastic underneath—but it’s not dead yet, and when I push my heel down harder, it finally responds, jerking me forward as I squeeze between two rows of cars. My bright, rainbow-dyed hair whips across my face.  
  
  “Hey!” a driver yells as I maneuver past his car. I glance over my shoulder to see him waving a fist at me through his open window. “You almost clipped me!”  
  
  I just turn around and ignore him. Usually, I’m a nicer person than this—or, at least, I would have shouted an apology. But this morning, I’d woken up to a yellow paper taped to the door of my apartment, its words printed in the largest font you can imagine.  
  
  72 HOURS TO PAY OR VACATE  
  
  Translation: I’m almost three months behind on my rent. So, unless I can get my hands on $3,450, I’ll be homeless and in the streets by the end of the week.  
  
  That’d put a damper on anyone’s day.  
  
  My cheeks sting from the wind. The sky beyond the cut of skyscrapers is gray, turning grayer, and in a few hours this flurry of snow will become a steady fall. Cars jam the streets, a nonstop trail of brake lights and honking from here all the way to Times Square. The occasional scream of a traffic controller’s whistle sounds above the chaos. The air is thick with the smell of exhaust, and steam billows from an open vent nearby. People swarm up and down the sidewalks. Students coming home from school are easy to spot, their backpacks and fat headphones dotting the crowds.  
  
  Technically, I should be one of them. This should have been my first year of college. But I started skipping classes after Dad died, and I dropped out entirely several years ago. (Okay, fine—technically, I was expelled. But I swear I would’ve quit anyway. More on that later.)  
  
  I look down at my phone again, my mind returning to the hunt. Two days ago, I had gotten the following text message:  
  
  New York Police Department ALERT!  
  
  Arrest warrant out for Martin Hamer.  
  
  Payment $5,000.  
  
  The police are so busy these days with the increasing crime in the streets that they don’t have time to hunt for petty criminals on their own—petty criminals like Martin Hamer, who’s wanted for gambling on Warcross, stealing money, and allegedly selling drugs to fund his bets. So, about once a week, the cops send out a message like this, a promise to pay anyone who can catch the criminal in question.  
  
  That’s where I come in. I’m a bounty hunter, one of many in Manhattan, and I’m fighting to capture Martin Hamer before another hunter can.  
  
  Anyone who’s ever fallen on hard times will understand the nearly constant stream of numbers that run through my mind. A month’s rent in the worst apartment in New York: $1,150. A month’s food: $180. Electricity and internet: $150. Boxes of macaroni, ramen, and Spam left in my pantry: 4. And so on. On top of that, I owe $3,450 in unpaid rent, and $6,000 in credit card debt.  
  
  The number of dollars left in my bank account: $13.  
  
  Not the normal things a girl my age worries about. I should be freaking out over exams. Turning in papers. Waking up on time.  
  
  But I haven’t exactly had a normal adolescence.  
  
  Five thousand dollars is easily the largest bounty in months. For me, it might as well be all the money in the world. So, for the last two days, I’ve done nothing but track this guy. I’ve lost four bounties in a row this month. If I lose this one, too, I’m going to be in real trouble.  
  
  Tourists always clogging up the streets, I think as a detour forces me down a path right into Times Square, where I get stuck behind a cluster of auto-taxis jammed at a pedestrian walkway. I lean back on my board, pull myself to a halt, and start inching backward. As I go, I glance down at my phone again.  
  
  A couple of months ago, I’d succeeded in hacking into the main directory of Warcross players in New York and synced it all up to my phone’s maps. It’s not hard, not if you remember that everyone in the world is connected in some way to everyone else. It’s just time-consuming. You worm your way into one account, then branch out to their friends, then their friends, and eventually, you’re able to track the location of any player in New York City. Now I’ve finally managed to place my target’s physical location, but my phone’s a cracked, beat-up old thing, with an antique battery that’s on its last legs. It keeps trying to sleep in order to save energy, and the screen is so dark I can barely see anything.  
  
  “Wake up,” I mutter, squinting at the pixels.  
  
  Finally, the poor phone lets out a pitiful buzz, and the red location marker updates on my map.  
  
  I make  
my way out of the taxi jam and push my heel down on my board. It protests for a moment, but then it speeds me forward, a dot in a sea of moving humanity.  
  
  Once I reach Times Square, screens tower above me, surrounding me in a world of neon and sound. Every spring, the official Warcross Championships kick off with a huge ceremony, and two teams of top-ranking players compete in an all-stars opening round of Warcross. This year’s opening ceremony happens tonight in Tokyo—so all the screens are Warcross-related today, showing a frenzied rotation of famous players, commercials, and footage of last year’s highlights. Frankie Dena’s latest, craziest music video plays on the side of one building. She’s dressed like her Warcross avatar—in a limited edition suit and webbed glitter cape—and dancing with a bunch of businessmen in bright pink suits. Underneath the screen, a group of excited tourists stop to pose for photos with some guy dressed in fake Warcross gear.  
  
  Another screen features five of the superstar players competing in tonight’s opening ceremony. Asher Wing. Kento Park. Jena MacNeil. Max Martin. Penn Wachowski. I crane my neck to admire them. Each one is dressed from head to toe in the hottest fashion of the season. They smile down at me, their mouths big enough to swallow the city, and as I look on, they all hold up cans of soda, declaring Coca-Cola their drink of choice during game season. A marquee of text scrolls below them:  
  
  TOP WARCROSS PLAYERS ARRIVE IN TOKYO, POISED FOR WORLD DOMINATION  
  
  Then I’m through the intersection and cut onto a smaller road. My target’s little red dot on my phone shifts again. It looks like he’s turned onto Thirty-Eighth Street.  
  
  I squeeze my way through another few blocks of traffic before I finally arrive, pulling over along the curb beside a newsstand. The red location dot now hovers over the building in front of me, right above a café’s door. I tug my scarf down and let out a sigh of relief. My breath fogs in the icy air. “Caught you,” I whisper, allowing myself a smile as I think of the five-thousand-dollar bounty. I hop off my electric skateboard, pull out its straps, and swing it over my shoulder so that it bumps against my backpack. It’s still warm from use, the heat of it seeping through my hoodie, and I arch my back to savor it.  
  
  As I pass the newsstand, I glimpse the magazine covers. I have a habit of checking them out, searching for coverage of my favorite person. There’s always something. Sure enough, one of the magazines features him prominently: a tall young man lounging in an office, dressed in dark trousers and a crisp collar shirt, sleeves casually rolled up to his elbows, his face obscured by shadows. Below him is the logo for Henka Games, Warcross’s parent studio. I stop to read the headline.  
  
  HIDEO TANAKA TURNS 21  
  
  INSIDE THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE WARCROSS CREATOR  
  
  My heart skips a familiar beat at my idol’s name. Too bad there’s no time to stop and flip through the magazine. Maybe later. I reluctantly turn away, adjust my backpack and board higher on my shoulders, and pull up my hood to cover my head. The glass windows I pass reflect a distorted vision of myself—face elongated, dark jeans stretched too long, black gloves, beat-up boots, faded red scarf wrapped around my black hoodie. My rainbow-colored hair spills out from underneath my hood. I try to imagine this reflected girl printed on the cover of a magazine.  
  
  Don’t be stupid. I push the ridiculous thought away as I head toward the café’s entrance, shifting my thoughts instead to the running checklist of tools in my backpack.  
  
  Handcuffs  
  
  Cable launcher  
  
  Steel-tipped gloves  
  
  Phone  
  
  Change of clothes  
  
  Stun gun  
  
  Book  
  
  On one of my first hunts, my target threw up all over me after I used my stun gun (#6) on him. I started bringing a change of clothes (#5) after that. Two targets have managed to bite me, so after a few tetanus shots, I added the gloves (#3). The cable launcher (#2) is for getting to hard-to-reach places and catching hard-to-reach people. My phone (#4) is my portable hacking assistant. Handcuffs (#1) are because, well, obviously.  
  
  And the book (#7) is for whenever the hunt involves a lot of waiting around. Entertainment that won’t eat up my batteries is always worth bringing.  
  
  Now I step into the café, soak in the warmth, and check my phone again. Customers are lined up along a counter displaying pastries, waiting for one of the four auto-cashiers to open. Decorative bookshelves line the walls. A smattering of students and tourists sit at the tables. When I point my phone’s camera at them, I can see their names hovering over their heads, meaning none of them have set themselves on Private. Maybe my target isn’t on this floor.  
  
  I wander past the shelves, my attention shifting from table to table. Most people never really observe their surroundings; ask anyone what the person sitting nearby was wearing, and chances are good that they can’t tell you. But I can. I can recite to you the outfits and demeanor of every person in that coffee line, can tell you exactly how many people are sitting at each table, the precise way someone’s shoulders hunch just a little too much, the two people sitting side by side who never say a word, the guy who is careful not to make eye contact with anyone else. I can take in a scene like a photographer might take in a landscape—relax my eyes, analyze the full view all at once, search for the point of interest, and take a mental snapshot to remember the whole thing.  
  
  I look for the break in the pattern, the nail that protrudes.  
  
  My gaze pauses on a cluster of four boys reading on the couches. I watch them for a while, waiting for signs of conversation or the hint of notes being passed by hand or phone. Nothing. My attention goes to the stairs leading to the second floor. No doubt other hunters are closing in on this target, too—I have to get to him before anyone else does. My steps quicken as I head up.  
  
  No one is here, or so it seems. But then I notice the faint sound of two voices at a table in a far corner, tucked behind a pair of bookshelves that make them almost impossible to see from the stairs. I move in closer on silent feet, then peek through the shelves.  
  
  A woman is seated at the table, her nose buried in a book. A man stands over her, nervously shuffling his feet. I hold up my phone. Sure enough, both of them are set to Private.  
  
  I slip to the side of the wall so that they can’t see me, and listen closely.  
  
  “I don’t have until tomorrow night,” the man is saying.  
  
  “Sorry,” the woman replies. “But there’s not much I can do. My boss won’t release that kind of money to you without taking extra security measures, not when the police have an arrest warrant for you.”  
  
  “You promised me.”  
  
  “And I’m sorry, sir.” The woman’s voice is calm and cynical, like she’s had to say this countless times before. “It’s game season. The authorities are on high alert.”  
  
  “I have three hundred thousand notes with you. Do you have any idea what that’s exchanging for?”  
  
  “Yes. It’s my job to know,” the woman answers in the driest voice I’ve ever heard.  
  
  Three hundred thousand notes. That’s about two hundred thousand dollars, at the current exchange rate. High roller, this one. Gambling on Warcross is illegal in the United States; it’s one of the many laws the government has recently passed in a desperate attempt to keep up with technology and cybercrime. If you win a bet on a Warcross match, you win game credits called notes. But here’s the thing—you can either take those notes online or to a physical place, where you meet a teller like this lady. You trade your notes to her. She gives you real cash in return, while taking a cut for her boss.  
  
  “It’s my money,” the guy is insisting now.  
  
  “We have to protect ourselves. Extra security measures take time. You can come back tomorrow night, and we can exchange half of your notes.”  
  
  “I told you, I don’t have until tomorrow night. I need to leave the city.”  
  
  The conversation repeats itself all over again. I hold my breath as I listen. The woman has all but confirmed his identity.  
  
  My eyes narrow, and my lips turn up into a hungry little smirk. This, ri  
ght here, is the moment I live for during a hunt—when the bits and pieces I’ve exposed converge into a fine point, when I see my target standing physically before me, ripe for the picking. When I’ve solved the puzzle.  
  
  Got you.  
  
  As their conversation turns more urgent, I tap my phone twice and send out a text message to the police.  
  
  Suspect in physical custody.  
  
  I get a reply almost immediately.  
  
  NYPD ALERTED.  
  
  I pull the stun gun out of my backpack. It catches for an instant against the edge of the zipper, making the faintest scraping sound.  
  
  The conversation halts. Through the bookshelves, both the man and woman jerk their heads toward me like deer in headlights. The man sees my expression. His face is covered in a sheen of sweat, and his hair is plastered against his forehead. A fraction of a second passes.  
  
  I shoot.  
  
  He bolts—I miss him by a hair. Good reflexes. The woman darts up from her table, too, but I could care less about her. I race after him. He hops down the stairs three at a time, nearly falling in his rush, scattering his phone and a bunch of pens behind him. He sprints for the entrance as I reach the first floor. I burst through the revolving glass door right behind him.  
  
  We emerge onto the street. People let out startled shouts as the man shoves them aside—he knocks a camera-clicking tourist flat on her back. In one movement, I swing my electric board to the ground, jump on, and slam my heel down as hard as I can. It makes a high-pitched whoosh—I lunge forward, speeding down the sidewalk. The man glances over his shoulder to see me gaining fast on him. He darts left down the street at a full, panicked run.  
  
  I veer in his direction at such a sharp angle that the edge of my board protests against the pavement, leaving a long, black line. I aim my stun gun at the man’s back and shoot.  
  
  He shrieks and falls. Instantly, he tries to stand again, but I catch up to him. He grabs my ankle. I stumble, kicking at him. His eyes are wild, his teeth clenched and jaw tight. Out flashes a blade. I see its glint in the light just in time. I kick him off me and roll away right before he can stab at my leg. My hands get a grip on his jacket. I fire the stun gun once more, this time at close range. It hits true. His body goes rigid, and he collapses on the pavement, trembling.  
 I jump on him. My knee presses hard into his back as the man sobs on the ground. The sound of police sirens rounds the bend. A circle of people have gathered around us now, their glasses recording away.  
  
  “I didn’t do anything,” the man whimpers over and over again. His voice comes out garbled by how hard I’m pushing him into the ground. “The lady inside—I can give you her name—”  
  
  “Shut it,” I cut him off as I slide handcuffs onto his wrists.  
  
  To my surprise, he does. They don’t always listen like that. I don’t relent until a police car pulls up, until I see red and blue lights flashing against the wall. Only then do I get up and back away from him, making sure to hold out my hands so that the cops can see them clearly. My skin tingles from the rush of a successful hunt as I watch the two policemen yank the man onto his feet.  
  
  Five thousand dollars! When was the last time I had even half that much money at once? Never. I’ll get to be less desperate for a while—I’ll pay off the rent that I owe, which should calm my landlord down for now. Then I’ll have $1,550 left. It’s a fortune. My mind flips through my other bills. Maybe I can eat something other than instant noodles tonight.  
  
  I want to do a victory jump in the air. I’ll be okay. Until the next hunt.  
  
  It takes me a moment to realize that the police are walking away with their new captive without even looking in my direction. My smile falters.  
  
  “Hey, Officer!” I shout, hurrying after the closer one. “Are you giving me a ride to the station for my payment, or what? Should I just meet you there?”  
  
  The officer gives me a look that doesn’t seem to jibe with the fact that I just caught them a criminal. She looks exasperated, and dark circles under her eyes tell me she hasn’t gotten much rest. “You weren’t first,” she says.  
  
  I startle, blinking. “What?” I say.  
  
  “Another hunter phoned in the alert before you.”  
  
  For a moment, all I can do is stare at her.  
  
  Then I spit out a swear. “What a load of bull. You saw the whole thing go down. You all confirmed my alert!” I hold up my phone so the officer can see the text message I received. Sure enough, that’s when my phone’s battery finally dies.  
  
  Not that the proof would’ve made a difference. The officer doesn’t even glance at the phone. “It was just an auto-reply. According to my messages, I received the first call-in from another hunter on location. Bounty goes to the first, no exceptions.” She offers me a sympathetic shrug.  
  
  This is the dumbest technicality I’ve ever heard. “The hell it does!” I argue. “Who’s the other hunter? Sam? Jamie? They’re the only other ones canvassing this turf.” I throw my hands up. “You know what—you’re lying, there is no other hunter. You just don’t want to pay out.” I follow her as she turns away. “I saved you from a dirty job—that’s the deal, that’s why any bounty hunter goes after the people you’re too lazy to catch. You owe me this one and you—”  
  
  The cop’s partner grabs my arm and shoves me so hard that I nearly fall. “Get back,” he says with a snarl. “Emika Chen, isn’t it?” His other hand is wrapped tightly around the grip of his sheathed gun. “Yeah, I remember you.”  
  
  I’m not about to argue with a loaded weapon. “Fine, fine.” I force myself to take a step back and raise my hands in the air. “I’m going, okay? Leaving now.”  
  
  “I know you already got some jail time, kid.” He glares at me, his eyes hard and glittering, before joining his partner. “Don’t make me give you another strike.”  
  
  I hear the police radio calling them away to another crime scene. The noise around me muffles, and the image in my mind of the five thousand dollars starts to waver until it finally blurs into something I no longer recognize. In the span of thirty seconds, my victory has been tossed into someone else’s hands.  
  
  2  
  
  I ride out of Manhattan in silence. It’s getting colder, and the flurries have turned into steady snow, but the sting of the wind against my face suits my mood just fine. Here and there, parties have started to break out in the streets, and people decked out in red-and-blue jerseys count down the time at the top of their lungs. I watch as their celebrations swirl by. In the distance, every side of the Empire State Building is lit up and displaying enormous Warcross images.  
  
  Back when I was still living at the foster group home, I could see the Empire State Building if I climbed up onto the roof. I’d sit there and stare for hours as Warcross images rotated on its side, my skinny legs swinging, until dawn came and the sunlight would bathe me in gold. If I stared long enough, I could picture myself displayed up there. Even now, I feel that old twinge of excitement at the sight of the building.  
  
  My electric skateboard beeps once, snapping me out of my reverie. I look down. The battery’s been drained to its final bar. I sigh, slow to a stop, and swing my board over my shoulder. Then I dig for some change in my pocket and head into the first subway station I can find.  
  
  Twilight has faded to a blue-gray evening by the time I arrive in front of the crumbling Hunts Point¸ Bronx, apartment complex I call home. This is the other side of the glittering city. Graffiti covers one side of the building. Rusted iron bars cage the first floor windows. Trash is heaped near the main entrance steps—plastic cups, fast-food wrappers, broken beer bottles—all partially hidden underneath a thin dusting of snow. There are no lit-up screens here, no fancy auto-cars driving through the cracked streets. My shoulders droop, and my feet feel like lead. I haven’t even eaten dinner yet, but at this point, I can’t decide if I want food or sleep more.  
  
  Farther down the street, a group of homeless people are settling in, spreading their blankets and pitching their tents in the entryway of a shuttered store. Plastic bags line the insides of their threadbare clothes. I look away, heartsick. Once upon a time they too were kids, maybe had families who loved them. What had brought them to this point? What would I look like, in their place?  
  
  Finally, I will myself up the steps through the main entrance and down the hall to my front door. The hall reeks, as always, of cat pee and moldy carpets, and through the thin walls, I can hear neighbors shouting at each other, a TV’s volume cranked high, a wailing baby. I relax a little. If I’m lucky enough, I won’t bump into my landlord, with his tank and sweats and red face. Maybe I can at least get an uneventful night’s sleep before I have to deal with him in the morning.  
  
  A new eviction notice has gone up on my door, right where I’d torn the old one off. I stare at it for a second, exhausted, rereading.  
  
  NEW YORK EVICTION NOTICE  
  
  TENANT NAME: EMIKA CHEN  
  
  72 HOURS TO PAY, OR VACATE  
  
  Was it really necessary for him to come back and put up a new sign, as if he wants to make sure everyone else in the building knows? To humiliate me further? I tear the notice off the door, crumple it in my fist, and stand still for a moment, staring at the blank space where the paper once hung. There is a familiar desperation in me, a rising panic that beats loudly in my chest, pounding out each thing I owe. The numbers in my head start over again. Rent, food, bills, debt.  
  
  Where am I going to get the money in three days?  
  
  “Hey!”  
  
  I jump at the voice. Mr. Alsole, my landlord, has emerged from his apartment and is stalking toward me, his frown resembling a fish’s, his thin orange hair sticking out in every direction. One look at his bloodshot eyes tells me that he’s high on something. Great. Another argument. I can’t deal with another fight today. I fumble around for my keys, but it’s too late—so instead, I straighten my shoulders and lift my chin.  
  
  “Hey, Mr. Alsole.” I have a way of pronouncing the name like it’s Mr. Asshole.  
  
  He scowls at me. “You been avoidin’ me all week.”  
  
  “Not on purpose,” I insist. “I got a gig as a waitress in the mornings now, down at the diner, and—”  
  
  “Nobody needs waitresses anymore.” He squints at me suspiciously.  
  
  “Well, this place does. And it’s the only job around. There’s nothing else.”  
r />   “You said you’d pay today.”  
  
  “I know what I said.” I take a deep breath. “I can come by later to talk—”  
  
  “Did I say later? I want it now. And you’re gonna need to add another hundred bucks to what you owe.”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “Rent’s going up this month. On the whole block. You think this ain’t hot property?”  
  
  “That’s not fair,” I say, my temper rising. “You can’t do that—you just raised it!”  
  
  “You know what’s not fair, little girl?” Mr. Alsole narrows his eyes at me and folds his arms. The gesture stretches out the freckles on his skin. “The fact that you’re living for free in my building.”  
  
  I hold both hands up. The blood is rushing to my cheeks. I can feel its fire. “I know—I just—”  
  
  “What about notes? You got more than five thousand of those?”  
  
  “If I did, I’d be giving them to you.”  
  
  “Then offer something else,” he spits. He shoves a sausage-like finger at my skateboard. “I see that again, I’ll smash it with a hammer. You sell that thing and give me the money.”  
  
  “It’s only worth fifty bucks!” I take a step forward. “Look, I’ll do whatever it takes, I swear, I promise.” The words stream out of me in a jumbled mess. “Just give me a few more days.”  
  
  “Listen, kid.” He holds up three fingers, reminding me exactly how many months I owe him. “I’m done with pity checks.” Then he looks me up and down. “You’re what, eighteen now?”  
  
  I stiffen. “Yeah.”  
  
  He nods down the hall. “Go get a job at the Rockstar Club. Their girls earn four hundred a night just for dancing on some tables. You could probably pull five hundred. And they won’t even care about the red on your record.”  
  
  I narrow my eyes. “You think I haven’t checked? I have to be twenty-one.”  
  
  “I don’t care what you do. Thursday. Got it?” Mr. Alsole’s talking forcefully enough now for his spit to fly onto my face. “And I want this apartment cleared out. Spotless.”  
  
  “It wasn’t spotless in the first place!” I shout back. But he’s already turned his back and is stalking down the hall.  
  
  I let out a slow breath as he slams his door shut. My heart pounds against my ribs. My hands shake.  
  
  My thoughts return to the homeless, with their hollow eyes and sloped shoulders, and then to the working girls I’ve occasionally seen leaving the Rockstar Club, reeking of smoke and sweat and heavy perfume, their makeup smeared. Mr. Alsole’s threat is a reminder of where I might end up if I don’t get lucky soon. If I don’t start making some hard choices.  
  
  I’ll find a way to work some pity into him. Soften him up. Just give me one more week, I swear, and I’ll get half the money to you. I promise. I play these words in my head as I shove the key in the lock and open the door.  
  
  It’s dark inside, even with the neon-blue glow from outside the window. I flip on the lights, toss my keys on the kitchen counter, and throw the crumpled eviction notice in the trash. Then I pause to look around the apartment.  
  
  It’s a tiny studio, crammed full of belongings. Cracks in the painted plaster run along the walls. One of the bulbs in the room’s only ceiling light has burned out, while the second bulb is fading, waiting for someone to replace it before it dies, too. My Warcross glasses are lying on the fold-out dining table. I’d rented them for cheap because they’re an older model. Two cardboard boxes of stuff are stacked by the kitchen, two mattresses lie on the ground by the window, and an ancient TV and old, mustard-yellow couch take up the rest of the space.  
  
  “Emi?”  
  
  A muffled voice comes from underneath a blanket on the couch. My roommate sits up, rubs her face, and runs a hand through her nest of blond hair. Keira. She’d fallen asleep with her Warcross glasses on, and a faint crease trails across her cheeks and forehead. She wrinkles her nose at me. “You got some guy with you again?”  
  
  I shake my head. “No, just me tonight,” I reply. “Did you give Mr. Alsole your half of the money today, like you said you would?”  
  
  “Oh.” She avoids my stare, swings her legs over the side of the couch, and reaches for a half-eaten bag of chips. “I’ll get it to him by this weekend.”  
  
  “You realize he’s throwing us out on Thursday, right?”  
  
  “No one told me.”  
  
  My hand tightens against the back of the dining room chair. She hasn’t left the apartment all day, so she never even saw the eviction notice on the door. I take a deep breath, reminding myself that Keira hasn’t been able to find any work, either. After almost a year of trying, she’s just given up and curled inward, spending her days idling away in Warcross instead.  
  
  It’s a feeling I know well, but I’m too exhausted tonight to spare much patience for her. I wonder whether the realization of living on the streets will hit her when we finally end up standing on the sidewalk with all of our belongings.  
  
  I strip off my scarf and hoodie down to my favorite tank top, go into the kitchen, and start a pot of water to boil. Then I head over to the two mattresses lying against the wall.  
  
  Keira and I keep our beds separated with a makeshift divider duct-taped together out of old cardboard boxes. I’d made my side as cozy and neat as I could, decorating the space with trails of golden fairy lights. A map of Manhattan, covered in my scribbles, is pinned on my wall, along with magazine covers featuring Hideo Tanaka, a written list of the current Warcross amateur leaderboards, and a Christmas ornament from when I was a kid. My final possession is one of my dad’s old paintings, the only one I have left, propped carefully beside the mattress. The canvas is exploding with color, the paint thick and textured as if still wet. I used to have more of his work, but I had to sell them off every time things got too desperate, chipping away at his memory in order to survive his absence.  
  
  I flop on my mattress and it lets out a loud squeak. The ceiling and walls are awash in neon blue from the liquor mart across the street. I lie still, listening to the constant, distant wail of sirens coming from somewhere outside, my eyes fixed on an old water stain on the ceiling.  
  
  If Dad were here, he would be fussing about in his fashion professor mode, mixing paints and washing brushes in jars. Perhaps mulling over his spring class syllabus, or his plans for New York Fashion Week.  
  
  I turn my head toward the rest of the apartment and pretend that he’s here, the healthy, un-sickly version of him, his tall, slender silhouette outlined in light near the doorway, his forest of dyed blue hair shining silver in the darkness, facial scruff neatly trimmed, black-rimmed glasses framing his eyes, dreamer’s face on. He would be wearing a black shirt that exposed the colorful tattoos winding up and down his right arm, and his appearance would be impeccable—his shoes polished and trousers perfectly ironed—except for flecks of paint staining his hands and hair.  
  
  I smile to myself at the memory of sitting in a chair, swinging my legs and staring at the bandages on my knees while my father put temporary streaks of color into my hair. Tears still stained my cheeks from when I’d run home from school, sobbing, because someone had pushed me down at recess and I’d scraped holes in my favorite jeans. Dad hummed while he worked. When he finished, he held a mirror up to me, and I gasped in delight. Very Givenchy, very on trend, he said, tapping my nose lightly. I giggled. Especially when we tie it up like this. See? He gathered my hair up into a high tail. Don’t get too used to it—it’ll wash out in a few days. Now, let’s go get some pizza.  
  
  Dad used to say that my old school’s uniform was a pimple on the face of New York. He used to say that I should dress like the world’s a better place than it actually is. He would buy flowers every time it rained and fill our home with them. He would forget to wipe his hands during his painting sessions and end up leaving colorful fingerprints all over the place. He poured his meager salary into presents for me and art supplies and charities and clothes and wine. He laughed too often and fell in love too quickly and drank too freely.  
  
  Then one afternoon, when I was eleven, he came home, sat  
down on the couch, and stared blankly into space. He’d just returned from a doctor’s appointment. Six months later, he was gone.  
  
  Death has a terrible habit of cutting straight through every careful line you’ve drawn between your present and your future. The line that leads to your dad filling your dorm room with flowers on your graduation day. To him designing your wedding dress. To him coming over for dinner at your future house every Sunday, where his off-key singing would make you laugh so hard you’d cry. I had a hundred thousand of these lines, and in one day they were severed, leaving me with nothing but a stack of his medical bills and gambling debt. Death didn’t even give me somewhere to direct my anger. All I could do was search the sky.  
  
  After he died, I started copying his look—wild, unnaturally colorful hair (boxes of hair dye being the only thing I’m willing to waste money on) and a sleeve of tattoos (done for free out of pity from Dad’s former tattoo artist).  
  
  I turn my head slightly and glance at the tattoos winding along my left arm, then run a hand across the images. They start at my wrist and go up my shoulder, bright hues of blue and turquoise, gold and pink—peony flowers (my father’s favorite), Escher-style buildings rising out of ocean waves, music notes, and planets against a backdrop of outer space, a reminder of nights when Dad would drive us out to the countryside to see the stars. Finally, they end with a slender line of words that run along my left collarbone, a mantra Dad used to repeat to me, a mantra I recite to myself whenever things get too grim.  
  
  Every locked door has a key.  
  
  Every problem has a solution.  
  
  Every problem, that is, except the one that took him. Except the one I’m in now. And the thought is almost enough to make me curl up and close my eyes, to let myself sink back into a familiar dark place.

1mjpmoe,https://i.redd.it/p07r1xl1qihf1.jpeg,I feel kinda paranoid but… I think someone might be coming into our apartment? Any harmless “booby trap” ideas before I buy a camera?,"Okay, this might sound silly and maybe I’m just being paranoid, but both my boyfriend and I have started to get this weird feeling that someone might be coming into our apartment when we’re not home.

There’s no solid proof, just little things that feel… off. Like:
	•	I’ll notice an indentation on the blanket at the foot of the bed, almost like someone rested their hand or sat there.
	•	Sometimes I think I left the remotes on the coffee table, but then I’ll find them on the couch. Could be me being forgetful, I guess?
	•	A full pack of Oreos gone in a day and a half (not me, allegedly not him 😅
	•	Our door has a code lock (no physical key), and the guy across the hall gives us weird vibes. It’s just a feeling… but we’re wondering if he somehow knows the code? (Probably can see it from his peephole)
	•	Since I’ve started working from home, I haven’t noticed as much, but we were gone all day at a baseball game recently and came home to things feeling… off again. Oreos gone. Remotes moved. Nothing major, but strange.

My boyfriend says he gets the same weird feeling sometimes like stuff’s been touched or moved’ but he can’t name specific examples. Just that “something’s off” feeling.

We’re going out of town for a few days soon, and I haven’t pulled the trigger on buying a security camera yet. So I’m wondering:

Are there any simple, harmless “booby trap” ideas I can set up before we leave? I included a picture of what our door handle looks like, it doesnt turn when opened from the outside so putting something on the handle wouldnt work

Like…
	•	Flour or powder on the floor near the door?
	•	Tape or hair across the doorframe?
	•	Noting positions of blinds or drawers?

I don’t want to accuse anyone without real proof, but I also don’t want to ignore my gut. Has anyone done something like this or gone through something similar?",3,1754537920.0,Apartmentliving,12,0.8,False

I’m currently an Assistant Account Executive working at a financial communications agency (having worked across consulting, private market, and capital market clients) who is interested in learning more about what life is like on the in-house side. Out of college, the fast pace and client diversity was what excited me most about my current role, but I’m really curious about how I can leverage my knowledge and skill set in an in-house capacity at a financial services or technology company. 

Of course, goes without saying that there are many benefits in-house that seem to be better than agency on paper, so curious to hear about others’ experiences.

And even though our jobs depend on networking with the media and clients, I almost feel a bit clueless when it comes to networking for my personal growth opportunity? Especially, when it feels that in-house professionals are often reluctant to connect with those looking to pivot? Curious for any advice there or if anyone can offer some words or wisdom? I’ve been trying to set up in-person coffee chats to better improve the face time part of it all, but would love any additional help here!

1mjplgh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mjplgh,Looking to replace a no-name janky flashlight (suggestions please),"Hi!

I have this no-name flashlight that I want to replace, and am looking for suggestions. I use it everyday, mostly outside.   Any suggestions on a replacement would be appreciated - thank you in advance.

What I like about it:

* Zoom-able:  I use this feature ever day
* Dim-able:  It has 3 brightness + 2 strobe modes,  but I only ever use the 'bright' and 'low' modes
* USB Rechargeable
* The size:  I really like the size!
* The brightness:  I have no idea what it is, but it is adequate.  Brighter is better, though (yes?)

What I don't like about it:

* The switch is surprisingly hard to find by touch.  Amazingly hard to find, actually.
* The recharge circuit is wonky - I need to leave the flashlight on while charging, or it thinks it's done (I actually keep it in a coffee cup while charging because I'm sure it's going to burst into flames some day).

Alt text: Business professionals discussing company formation in an office in Bahrain.](https://www.forbes.com/business/), Bahrain’s non-oil sector is projected to grow by 4.7% this year, outpacing regional rivals. Reuters reported in Q1 2025 that FDI inflows hit a record high of $1.75 billion, with free zone companies making up nearly 40% of new registrations (Reuters, June 2025).\
Most entrepreneurs choose free zones for:\
- 100% foreign ownership rights (details here)\
- Tax-free business structures\
- Streamlined licensing through platforms like Sijilat\
- Fast-track visas via the LMRA\
- Strategic locations—think Bahrain Bay, Bahrain International Investment Park (BIIP), and the up-and-coming Tatweer Petroleum Free Zone\
Bahrain’s free zones are uniquely flexible compared to UAE or KSA. Office setups in major zones—BIIP, Bahrain Logistics Zone (BLZ), and the new Salman Industrial City Free Zone—cater to a wide range of budgets and business models.\
Company Formation in Bahrain: Key Structures and Ownership Options\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in a Bahrain free zone office.).\
Popular Bahrain free zone entity types:\
- WLL (With Limited Liability)\
- Branch of a Foreign Company\
- Single Person Company (SPC)\
- Bahrain Shareholding Company (BSC)\
Ownership rules are liberally pro-business. Since the 2023-2024 reforms (enforced from February 1, 2025), most sectors now allow up to 100% foreign ownership—even for professional services, e-commerce, and fintech (sector list). Certain regulated industries (banks, telecoms) require EDB or CBB approval.\
Rental Costs in Bahrain’s Free Zones: 2025 Market Overview\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs: Calculating Bahrain free zone office rental budgets..\
2025 Office Rental Price Ranges\
\
\
Bahrain International Investment Park (BIIP)\
Small office (20-40 m²): BHD 2,000–3,500/year\
Open-plan (50–100 m²): BHD 4,000–6,500/year\
Custom space (over 150 m²): from BHD 35/m²/year\
\
\
Bahrain Logistics Zone (BLZ)\
Warehouse (500 m²): BHD 7,500–11,500/year\
Office+warehouse combos: BHD 12,000–22,000/year\
\
\
Salman Industrial City Free Zone (2025 Launch Prices):\
Startup desks (coworking): from BHD 800/year\
Private offices (20–40 m²): BHD 2,800–4,200/year\
\
\
Add 10% for premium waterfront or Bahrain Bay towers; subtract 5-15% for inland or ground floor units.\
\
For the full cost breakdown of company setup and ongoing expenses, check Keylink’s Bahrain company formation cost guide.\
\
What’s Included in Free Zone Office Rental?\
\
Standard lease terms: 1-5 years (negotiable)\
Free zone amenities: business lounges, meeting rooms, security, and car parking\
Utilities: often included for SME units; metered for large custom spaces\
IT: Fiber internet packages from BHD 25/month\
\
Hidden Costs and Budget Protections\
\
Free zone registration fees: BHD 150–400 (one-off, depends on zone)\
MOICT commercial registration: BHD 100–270 (annual renewal)\
Visa costs: BHD 250–420/employee (expat quota via LMRA)\
Furnished offices: +10-20% premium\
Mandatory insurance: BHD 60–120/year\
\
Importantly, some free zones (notably BIIP) require three months’ rent upfront as deposit. Budget for legal translations (MOICT demands all documents in Arabic), which can run BHD 40-80 per document.\
Step-By-Step Guide: Fast-Tracking Free Zone Office Rental\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation for Bahrain company formation..\
3. Prepare Application Documents in Advance\
\
Required: Passport copies, CR application, business plan, lease pre-approval, sector licenses, Arabic translations of key documents.\
Insider shortcut: Use the Sijilat portal for pre-filling forms. Saves hours of waiting at MOICT.\
\
4. Apply for Commercial Registration (Sijilat)\
\
Submit all docs to MOICT (often in the Diplomatic Area government complex).\
Office lease approval is a prerequisite!\
Tip: Midweek mornings are fastest; Sunday is slow (everyone’s at majlis coffee or prayer).\
\
5. Complete Free Zone Lease Formalities\
\
Sign in person, sometimes with a Tamkeen or zone official present as witness.\
Pay deposit + 1st year rent.\
\
6. Activate Utilities and LMRA Labor Quota\
\
Electricity, water, and internet—submit at the same time as lease signing.\
LMRA labor quota takes 3-7 business days if all paperwork is perfect.\
\
7. Move In and Launch\
\
Remember, Ramadan business hours may shorten office access by 2-3 hours/day. Plan your move accordingly!\
\
Real-world challenge: When I set up in Seef, I underestimated the time for Arabic document translations—delaying my LMRA quota by a week. Now, I only use accredited translators with same-day service.\
Bahrain Free Zone Rentals vs. UAE and Saudi: What Sets Bahrain Apart?\
\
Alt text: Modern office building showing Bahrain’s unique business environment.).\
- Lower rents: Average rental is 20-35% less than equivalent UAE free zones.\
- Faster setup: Sijilat and MOICT are genuinely digital. Most UAE/KSA zones still require in-person signatures and physical stamps.\
- Business culture: Bahrain embraces both formal contracts and traditional majlis networking. Unexpected bonus: Some landlords serve gahwa (traditional coffee) during lease signings, a gesture of goodwill.\
2025 Regulatory Updates: New Policies Affecting Free Zone Rentals\
Effective April 1, 2025:\
- All new free zone tenants must submit a digital office plan to the MOICT for fire and safety compliance (previously, only for spaces over 100 m²).\
- Lease deposits are now capped at 4 months’ rent (down from 6) in most zones, freeing up startup cash flow.\
Don’t forget to check official guidelines for the latest requirements.\
Compliance, Bookkeeping, and Ongoing Obligations\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain company formation.\
- Maintain local accounting records (Arabic and English permitted)\
- Complete annual workforce reports for LMRA\
My best resource? Keylink’s accounting and bookkeeping services. Their cloud dashboard saved me a full week of paperwork at financial year-end.\
Common pitfall: Missing the annual renewal deadline with the MOICT. This can freeze your bank account—set calendar alerts and use a local consultant if needed!\
Local Business Culture: Insider Tips for a Smooth Setup\
Surprisingly, the fastest way to move your lease along is by inviting your landlord or free zone official for coffee—even better if it’s in a majlis. Bahrain favors relationships, and a face-to-face can resolve issues that would take days via email.\
\
Expect shorter working hours and relaxed deadlines during Ramadan.\
Bring a modest gift (dates or sweets) if meeting at someone’s majlis post-contract.\
\
And—something many guides miss: always double-check the spelling of your company name in Arabic on every document. One missed letter can force a re-registration (speaking from painful experience in the Diplomatic Area MOICT branch).\
Professional Support: Who to Work With\
\
Alt text: Professional business support: consultation for Bahrain company formation..\
Their team has prioritized my applications during peak periods, caught critical errors in Arabic documents, and even walked me into a last-minute Sijilat slot once when my bank guarantee was about to expire.\
Using a pro service saves time, prevents regulatory headaches, and gives you direct answers—especially for expats unfamiliar with Bahrain-specific paperwork.\
Free Zone Benefits: Why Bahrain Remains a Top Choice\
\
Zero corporate and personal income tax\
Full capital and profit repatriation\
No currency restrictions\
Access to GCC and global markets\
Vibrant startup and fintech ecosystem\
\
Read more at Bahrain Free Zones Guide.\
A quick tangent: Did you know Bahrain’s historic souqs—just minutes from modern free zones—still operate on haggling and social trust? That blend of old and new defines Bahrain’s business DNA: modern in regulation, traditional in deal-making.\
\
Practical FAQ: Bahrain Free Zone Rentals\
1. How much capital is required to set up a free zone company in Bahrain?\
Minimum capital varies by activity and legal form. SPCs and WLLs in service sectors require as little as BHD 1,000–5,000. Industrial and logistics activities may require BHD 20,000+ shown in bank reference letters.\
Full cost details: Bahrain company formation cost\
2. Can I use a virtual office address for my free zone company?\
Yes, but only in selected zones like BLZ and Salman Free Zone. MOICT recently tightened rules: business activities that involve physical trading or customer visits require dedicated office space. See latest rules.\
3. What are the best months to apply for free zone office rental?\
April–June and October–December. Avoid Ramadan for faster processing—government offices and landlords take longer to respond during the holy month.\
4. Does Bahrain allow 100% foreign ownership in all free zone activities?\
Almost—all except a short list of regulated sectors (banking, telecoms, national security).\
See allowed activities and ownership rules.\
5. How do I renew my commercial registration and free zone lease?\
\
Set up automatic reminders 4-6 weeks before expiry.\
Use Keylink’s compliance services for annual filings and renewals.\
Submit renewal forms online via Sijilat—in-person not usually required!\
\

thea is an unbelievably talented artist and quite frankly, one of the sweetest people I’ve ever met. I fell in love with her music last year and realized how important it was for more people to hear it!

When I first had the idea, I thought surely there is no chance this is possible, but then I remembered that I promised to myself to always lead with my heart, and that there is great power in simply asking. And, well, look where we are now!!

I’m so excited to share this with you all and I hope many of you will be able to come 🥹 If anyone is attending Bumbershoot in Seattle, this is happening the week after just a few hours north hehe!

You can get tickets to her show at The Brackendale Art Gallery: Café & Culture Centre on Sept 7 here and check out her music and tour info: https://linktr.ee/theamilie

There are only 60 seats available at the BAG, and they are going to go fast!! Make sure to tell all your friends, family, acquaintances, and long lost lovers.

The other shows are free to attend and all start at 19:00. The show at Trees Organic Coffee in Vancouver on Friday Sept 5 will
be a legendary evening with two other talented artists splitting the venue. This is such a cool venue with these live music Fridays being inspired by Carly Rae Jepson when she was a barista there. So much cool music history in this place. Arrive around 19:30-20:00 for this one. There is no ticket cost, but a donation basket will be passed around to support the artists!

They hold your phone, your late-night snack, that half-read book, and maybe even a secret stash of snacks (no judgment). But picking the right one? It can feel trickier than choosing a Netflix show. Fear not—here’s how to nail it:

1. Size Matters (But It’s Not Everything)

First, measure the space next to your bed! You don’t want a nightstand that’s so big it blocks the door, or so small it can’t even hold your lamp. Aim for a height that’s roughly level with your mattress (give or take a few inches) so you’re not stretching or bending to grab things. Pro tip: If your bed is low, skip the super tall nightstand—it’ll look out of place.

2. Storage: Form vs. Function

Ask yourself: Do I need a place to hide clutter, or am I more about a clean, minimalist vibe?

\- Drawers/cabinets: Great for stashing chargers, meds, or extra blankets so your top stays clear.

\- Open shelves: Perfect if you want easy access to books, a cute plant, or your favorite candle (just avoid piling stuff up—chaos = stress).

\- No storage?: A simple table works if you’re low on space or prefer a sleek look, but keep a small basket nearby for odds and ends.

3. Style: Match Your Vibe (But Don’t Overthink It)

Your nightstand should play nice with your bed and bedroom decor, but “matchy-matchy” isn’t a rule. Mix materials (wood + metal, anyone?) or go for a contrasting color to add personality. If your bed is busy (think tufted fabric or bold patterns), keep the nightstand simple. If your bed is plain, a fun design (curved legs, a unique finish) can be the star.

4. Practical Extras

\- Power outlet built-in: A game-changer for charging phones/tablets without messy cords.

\- Waterproof top: Essential if you’re prone to spilling coffee or leaving a wet glass out (we’ve all been there).

\- Sturdy construction: Wiggle test! A wobbly nightstand will drive you crazy—spend a little more for something solid.

5. Budget: You Don’t Have to Splurge

Nightstands range from $50 to $500+, and you don’t need to break the bank. Thrift stores, Facebook Marketplace, or even a DIY project (hello, repurposed crate!) can give you a unique piece that fits your budget. Just prioritize durability over flash—you’ll use this daily!

At the end of the day, the best nightstand is one that makes your bedtime routine easier. What’s your must-have feature? Drop a comment—I’m always here for nightstand hacks or horror stories (we’ve all bought a dud).

Sweet dreams (and happy shopping)!",1,1754537116.0,u_TRIUMPHQWE,0,1.0,False
1mjpd3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1mjpd3c/dog_exposed_to_parvo/,Dog Exposed to Parvo,"Short story long, yesterday as I was walking to get a cup of coffee I found two abandoned puppies and immediately took them home since it was raining and 65° - horrible conditions for puppies to be left out in (or any dog but certainly these small pups who I’d estimate to be ~5 weeks old). Here are the order of events:
1. Returned home with travel carrier puppies were found. Set carrier on cement porch. 
2. Let my dog out to do soft intro while they’re in crate so he doesn’t loose his mind in when I move them inside. He approaches carrier but I tell him to “leave it” which creates distance. 
3. I take off shoes and go inside to get old blanket. I bring my dog in with me.
4. I come back out to evict pups from carrier since they won’t leave it (I basically turn gently so they slide out). They move to blanket which is laid out on porch but do come in contact with cement porch. 
5. I wrap pups in blanket and move them to bathtub to wash with soap and warm water. One of them wees in the tub - dish soap is my temporary solution to this.
6. Once they are in the rub and rinsed I quickly throw blanket and towel in dryer - one does climb out of the tub but is placed back in within a few seconds.
6. After they are washed I run to the dryer and grab the towel and blanket - blanket is thrown in Ruffland crate and towel is used to dry them off. From being dried they are set in the crate (set right outside the bathroom in a sitting area where my dog’s kennel is (Orvis travel kennel). 
7. I set a disposable bowl in their crate with water, cleaned the bathtub with a bleach cleaner, changed my clothes, and set the clothes and the towel in a pile to clean later. 
8. I then started local animal clinics again (first calls made when I initially found them on the street with no answer) and found a place that would take them in the following day at 9AM (it was 2:00PM when I found them and got them home). 
9. I let them be while I returned to my home office and would  check in on them every 30 minutes or so. (They were downstairs, I was upstairs, and my dog fluctuated between his upstairs kennel and downstairs kennel). 
10. At one point in the afternoon I decided to check in on the pups and hold them and let them know they’d be okay. My dog was in proximity to the pups at this point but never made contact and eventually I had him go into his Orvis crate. The pups were in a 4 ft space for about 30 seconds - as I quickly realized this was a bad idea as one moved into the bathroom and wizzed on the tile (I cleaned this up immediately with paper towel and then lysol wipes). The other one did something similar, by wizzing on the wood floor right outside of the crate - again it was paper toweled then lysoled. The pups were placed back in the crate. 
11. After this I went thru the entire house with a swiffer wet floor cleaner to sanitize everything since I had my friends dogs over the past weekend and figured the time was right. 
12. I then biked to get the pups a thing of wet food (recommended by the clinic).
13. After my return I washed my clothing, bath mats, and towel because they were in contact with the pups. And then I watched my couch cushion covers on a sanitary cycle because my friends dogs were on the couch and I figured it could use a wash, too.
14. My dog and I sat out on the cement porch to read and the we came back in to go to bed (my dog sleeps in bed with me).
15. Wake up and move pup crate from sitting area to front door (pass thru kitchen and living room). 
16. Grab pups and set them outside in grass so they can potty. 
17. Move crate to front porch to grab contents (blanket, newspaper, bowl, and food) and dispose of them in trash bag.
18. Move crate back inside next to front door, lay down new paper, and grab pups from lawn to set back in crate.
19. Finish work, move pups from crate to cardboard box for transport with new blanket on bottom, get in uber, take pups to clinic and LEARN THEY ARE PARVO POSITIVE. 
20. Immediately start freaking out because that person who broke the parvo news also tells me I need to get my dog to the vet asap, I need to bleach everything in my house, and throw most everything away.
21. I call my regular vet who assures me my dog is going to be  okay, his DAPP is good thru 2026 and this probably isn’t the first time he’s been exposed, it’s just the first time I’m aware of it. She doesn’t think I need to come in ASAP and instead schedules us for 5 days out with the understanding if he falls ill they’ll see him immediately. 
22. I return home, change,  go to the store and purchase an abundance of cleaning supplies and immediately start bleaching everything I have touched or been near and everything my dog has touched or been near in the last 24H. This includes mopping the floors with bleach, letting air dry, and mopping again (I say mopping but I actually bought Miracloth all-purpose surface towels, dunked them in the 1:3 bleach concoction and used those on my swiffer attachment to clean the floors. After cycling thru one for each room, I put them in the laundry on the sanitary setting with more bleach and then hit them with the highest heat dryer setting before dunking and mopping again). I also wiped the porch down in the bleach mixture as did the porch steps and the stone walkway leading from my driveway to the porch. Door knobs? Bleached. Clothing and bedding? Bleached. Computer keyboard and mouse? Bleached. The book I read with my dog on the patio last night? You guessed it. Bleached. I could see myself going slightly manic and cleaning everything I touched yesterday with bleach but I am trying to refrain because that seems unreasonable and I practically washed my hands raw yesterday.
23. I also threw out all shoes worn in the last 24H, both of my dogs crate beds, towels, door mats, socks, the soap I used on the pups, and toys my dog may have chewed in the last 24H. I am going to bleach the Ruffland kennel multiple times over the next few days to attempt to spare it but if I’m not fully confident I will put it to the curb. 

Things to note:
1. My dog is a 7 y/o Germans Shepherd in great health. He goes with me everywhere and encounters a great amount of dogs and environments. 
2. The pups only urinated in my home in two isolated spaces and these accidents were immediately cleaned up.
3. I don’t believe the dogs threw up in the crate. 
4. In the morning one of them went #2 in the crate (not solid) but it was on the paper. 
5. The pups only went into the front yard and I don’t think either went #2. My dog will not be allowed in the front yard for the foreseeable future. They were thirsty and drank a lot of water but did not seem interested in eating. They were in good spirits!

Am I missing anything in terms of precautions I should be taking to protect my dog? Am I missing anything in terms of cleaning?? 

As an animal lover, my first instinct was to get these pups into a safe space. Parvo/sickness didn’t even cross my mind. I don’t regret taking them in. Now, I can refocus on decontaminating my home and making sure my dog is a-okay. Any insight will be appreciated!!! <3 ",3,1754537100.0,DogAdvice,3,1.0,False

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

With the events of last night, we called for a rest day. No activities, everyone just needed a breather to fully rest, heal, and for me to figure out what the hell was going on. I announced to the unaffected campers that due to an accident occurring last night, we would be having another rest day. Most didn’t pry, but gave me questioning looks as I left the stage. At this point, Pam became increasingly worried about her own kids, who had spent numerous hours in the areas where these events took place. Even worse, her kids began repeating about the ""strange men"" they saw when they were swimming. She opted to pick up everything and leave, saying she would come back once this situation had smoothed over and her kids started talking normally again. Can’t blame her, really. 

We banned campers from going anywhere near the water, putting a rope tied between two cabins with a sign so nobody forgot. Really it was a lame attempt to stop anyone, but there was no way to fully block off the entrance. The first rest day was somewhat normal in comparison to what was to come. The affected campers mostly found a closet or secluded space to hide. Once I felt less rattled from the prior night events myself, I went to check in on them. 

Most refused to talk to me, barring themselves away from anyone to see. The campers watched nervously, unsure fully what was going on. The only two who let me look at them were Jo and Leanne. They were in the same outhouse outside of cabin green. 

“Jo? Leanne? We know you're in there”

“...”

“Please, we are getting worried about you. We just want to make sure you two are okay. Do you need anything? You can ask me anything, I promise I will try to help you” what else was I supposed to say? 

The door swung open, and the two girls were huddled in the corner of the stall. Their skin all the way up to their necks were saggy, like Hilda's. It looked like both of them had the body of an old woman, and the face of a child. Their skin sagged unnaturally, looking bruised and veiny the closer it got to their legs. Their ankles looked the worst, with near rotting blackened flesh. It looked like the flesh of someone who had recently died. 

I suppose I had a hard time stopping my facial expression, as Jo burst out into tears. 

“I promise we are trying to find someone to help you. Do you need anything? Can you tell me anything about last night?” I asked in quick succession. 

“We breached curfew” Leanne choked, before refusing to talk to me again. 

Most campers silently used the amenities, such as sitting around the fire. The camp counselors did the same thing. I asked Marjorie to break the events to them, even though in my heart they were still kids like my campers. I found myself in a panic again, with Bill and Marjorie trying to convince the affected campers to leave their hiding spots to eat, to me spam calling the police department in the area. 

Nothing. All calls went unanswered. Eventually, my cabin phone line went dead. I tried calling other numbers, even using my cellphone, nothing. It was like we were in a dead zone for service. I begged any campers to come forward with their cellphones in case they brought theirs secretly, nobody fessed up. Or maybe they were better listeners than I thought and didn’t bring their phones at all. 

I was exhausted, so was Marjorie and Bill. It was 11pm and we all found ourselves drinking coffee and trying to discuss what to do in the admin cabin. We had been talking ourselves into circles trying to put together a rational explanation for these afflictions. I couldn’t help but to stare down at my legs, inspecting them to see if they were getting older too. 

“I’m going to watch the beach tonight” Bill declared after a moment of silence, going to stand up.

“No- no no wait. I’m just worried if you do, the light will get to you too. We are already down Pam, I can’t lose another one of you” I said weakly. Bill gave me a weird look.

“Honey, we don’t know what it is yet. It could be dangerous” Marjorie looked at Bill calmly. 

“No, I’m not having any more of these children get hurt. It won’t hurt me. You said it makes them old, right?” he looked at me

“Well, I mean it makes the skin look old. Who knows about their uh…. Insides? It could just be cosmetic, “ I said hesitantly. 

“Look at me, do you think I could get any more damn old? I can’t let them get hurt. If you need me, or get worried, I have my radio” Bill stood up, putting back on his cap and throwing his heavier flannel jacket. 

I sighed. He was right. 

Bill left the cabin with the slam of a door. Marjorie sighed along with me. 

“Hes a stubborn bag, my husband, I love him, that's my problem” she chuckled emptily. 

“I really don’t think this is a good idea” I commented

“Neither do I” 

“Should we,,,”

Silence. 

“We need to figure out this phone situation” I said firmly

“I thought you were getting Pam to call?” Marjorie asked innocently

“No, I have no phone to tell her to phone” I said more sternly than I meant to. 

“Oh, heh. Right. And you checked with the campers? No cellphones?”

“None. Or at least none wanted to give one to me” I replied

“Do you think it is an area wide blockage?” Marjorie asked 

“No clue. Thing is, the only number I have on hand is the volunteer police guys. I don’t even know how helpful they would be if we called them now. 

“Do you think… I have Bill and I’s truck. Maybe I could drive out to an RCMP detachment. I know there's one outside of Bellpoint” 

A rush of anxiety hit me for the fourth or fifth time that day. That means it would just be Bill and I until Marjorie returned. I love Bill, but Marjorie always seems to have her head more straight. But what other option was there? Cell outages can happen for kilometers in this area due to the distance away from a cell tower. It might be out for another week or two. I was running out of options. 

“Okay, yeah okay you should do that. How long will it take you?”

“Well, likely at least 5 or 6 hours one way. I could make it, maybe I could head out in a couple hours?” Marjorie replied. 

“Yeah, I guess that's what we will have to do” 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I stared blankly at the water in the early hours of the next morning at Bill's jacket floated lifelessly on the surface. Not only this, but several other articles of clothing floated in the lake, such as swimming suits, shirts and shorts. All kids and teen sizes. There was a harsh silence. When I tried to radio Bill this morning, it came back as no signal. It was still in his pocket. I barely remembered how I got there, but that's the next scene I remembered. My legs felt more sore than they usually did just to run there. 

I denied it at first, figuring that maybe they were fine and just threw their jackets and clothes into the water. Maybe it was a prank, a joke, a facade. My eyes twitched as I scanned the shore. No bootprints in the muddy bank, just prints walking into the water. 

My eyes peered to the left where I knew the counselors parked their cars. I already knew they fled. I heard whispers of it the day before. Trust me, I really wish I could flee right now too. They are in the lucky situation of only being here for the paycheque. This is my whole life, my home  and my income. I care for these people. And I could protect them up until now. I failed. 

I had no phone, Marjorie was gone, Bill was… and the counselors abandoned me. I walked back to camp in a daze. The wind was silent, only brushing against the tips of the trees. 

I was knocked awake when I saw the state of the remaining campers. 

Most had partially or fully wrinkled skin. Many of them sat in their normal lounging spots as they had been days before. 

It was like something was puppeting them to act like campers, while doing it all wrong. Two kids sat by an unlit firepit, staring blankly into where a fire was supposed to be. They ambiantly picked at their skin, with parts of bone starting to become visible. They wouldn’t look up at me.  Four campers stood in volleyball playing positions, completely frozen, as if waiting for the ball to come. The rest were in similar conditions all around camp. One simply sat against the wall of cabin pink, with only his ankles being sagged and worn. It was Matthew. 

I sat next to him. I felt defeated and lost, there was no hope left. I felt like I myself was walking around like a zombie. I wish I could make any of this make more sense. 

“It was like a stampede,” Matthew spoke. I quickly turned to look at him. 

“It was late at night, and something compelled everyone to run. It was primal. It woke us up from our sleep. I was trampled, I was never quick out of bed” 

“Why didn’t it wake us up?” 

“Bill tried to stop us, but there were too many. Most dived in, some walked in. Others took their time. The ones who jumped in, it was like cotton candy to water. They were gone. It was so dark” Matthew closed his eyes. 

“What… who-” I stammered

“I can’t stand the dark” Matthew curled in on himself. That was the last he spoke, despite my prying.  

Before I had time to react, two figures stood before me. I didn’t bother to look up. One had jeans and the other had a heavy coat going past his knees. 

“We need to chat, we have answers”. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The signal men took me back to my cabin, and sat me down at the table where I last saw Bill and Marjorie. The men had left for 20 minutes, but were now returning. They made some small talk going in, before sitting next to me. My eyes were trained on the floor, My stress was so bad that I practically picked my finger nails off. 

“Macy, can you hear us?” the jeans one said

“Mhm” I spoke

“We got a lot to tell you, so I need you fully here with us” 

I looked up. The one in jeans was gaunt with dark brown hair. He had a patch of scruff on his face, and his shirt was nicely tucked in. The other had taken off his coat, he was on the heavier side, wore a hoodie, and was blonde. 

“Are those kids okay? Is Bill okay?” 

“We’ll get to that, for now we need to explain who we are-”

“You’re the signal men, I know that” 

The blonde one snickered at this, before the dark haired one responded

“Ah- no. We have names, That's technically our fathers. I’m Samuel and my cousin here is Henry. We have been here across from lake kiwetotam for several generations” Samuel finished

“Really?”

“Yes, our job, our life, is to keep control of the lake. It started with our grandparents, went to our fathers, then to us” 

“Keep control…?”

“Lake kiwetotam is… different from other lakes in the area. We were never given the full story for how it became how it has, but we do know it was from some creature granting it sentience Once it gained sentience, it was infused with a deep hatred of people. We theorized it learnt of the abuse humans had put its fellow kinship through, and it became a site which could beckon humans in” 

“To kill them?”

“No, to return their bodies to the earth. It uses the bodies to nourish the water and the trees. That's its goal, lake kiwetotam, to return the next generation of humans to the earth rather than to perpetuate the abuse” Samuel spoke softly. 

“But how do you-” 

“Our grandfathers tested the waters and found that human created items could affect the rate at which the lake could influence the minds of people. Specifically, man made light. The presence of a flickering spotlight, if present at least once or twice a night, would keep it at bay. This also would mean it would only need monitoring at night” Samuel continued

“We have no clue how it works,” Henry added in. 

I paused, this was a lot of information to throw at me. The lake was sentient… and was kept at bay by only this one family? How did all of this happen? Were they really telling the truth?

“But why come now? Why didn’t you tell me before I started this camp? I would have never done such a thing if I knew otherwise” I demanded. 

“You can barely believe us even after seeing it for yourself” Henry said flatly. 

“Hilda said you guys only come out at night anyways, I guess” I mumbled 

“We had to come out during the day because things are getting out of control. What matters is that several of your campers have been lured and returned to the lake. The ones who we were able to save have had parts of their psyche taken, returning them to an animalistic state. We think we can save them, but you need to trust us” Samuel finished. 

“What do you mean out of control?”

“We can keep the lake at bay for only so many years. Give me your keys” Henry demanded. 

“What! I barely know you two people, and you want to take my keys? How can I trust-” I stood up, but their eyes darted to my hands. I looked down too, causing me to cringe in disgust. My hands and legs looked more decrepit than before. Bright veins and wrinkles popped, and purple bruises and moles were galore. I sat back down, feeling dizzy. I could barely make eye contact with them. 

“I think that ends our conversation. You are in no state to help us any further, and you don’t have the capacity to understand much else” the cousins stood up, grabbing my loop of keys from my jeans.  

“What the hell does that mean?! I went into that sludge to save my campers, I still have my brain and my psyche! Don’t you dare compare me to them. Who in the world even are you people??” I screamed as they walked past me. I wanted to get up, but my legs felt too weak to move. 

“Don’t you fucking leave me?! Marjorie will be coming back any minute, she will let me out of here!”

As they walked out, heavy thumps could be heard against the door. Once I was able to get the energy to stand up, I realized the door would no longer open. They knew it couldn’t be locked from the outside. The windows were solid glass, and I watched as the campers outside were aggressively grabbed and dragged back to one single cabin by the men. There was nothing that screaming and crying could do now. 

I’m still here, laying against the wall near the window. Slowly I feel myself sinking into the floorboards as my rotting flesh begins to eat into the wood. It was pretty painful at first, but now it feels calm. I hear yelling, cursing, like a herd of angry dogs barking outside. With my one eye I can see the flashes which, even during the day, illuminate my cabin. But soon it will come to a standstill. 

Maybe it was I that angered the lake. I came here after winning all this money, all to clear out all the trees and brush, remove the animals, everything. Even worse, I brought more cabins and people here, to trample over its hairy skin. Maybe it was patient with me for years until finally, lake kiwetotam was sick of us. I had angered the spirit, and now it would reclaim me. It would reclaim all of us. I deserved this, we all deserve this. We are all going to rot. 

I want to thank everyone for coming out to camp kiwetotam this year, and I hope to see all your smiling faces in 2025.",1,1754537065.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1mjp9ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1mjp9ve/am_i_expecting_too_much/,Am I expecting too much?,"I (33F) started speaking to a guy (34M) in May this year. We have the same profession and so we clicked in some way. We have had calls almost everyday and every call has lasted atleast an hour. 

Here is the catch: The calls are ALWAYS when he is doing something while talking to me AND other people around him. I feel like a fool waiting for him to finish up and give his complete attention to me which does not happen for more than 10min. I have tried to disconnect while telling him that he may call when he is free, but he doesn’t let me go off the phone. Also, when my dad spoke to him for the first time my dad suggested that we should video calls as it is not possible to meet so soon. The guy never brought up doing a video calls and we talked only through audio all the time. 

In July he planned to come to India. On the last Sunday of July, he and his mom visited our house and he didn’t speak as much as he talks on the phone. There were a couple of times where our gaze met, and I smiled slightly, but he didn’t smile back. My dad had to tell him 4 times to go somewhere outside to talk to me in private. His mom also nudged him once. Finally I got up to go and so he had to get up. On our way to a cafe, he didn’t speak much and I felt soo awkward. I felt he didn’t like me and he was there forcefully. I paid for the cab, he didn’t even offer to pay. He simply shut the door of the cab while I was inside paying the driver. I felt like I had come alone. 

In the cafe he behaved better. He paid for the coffee even though I insisted I pay. He brought up a topic we had already spoken about and there was still some awkwardness while I was pissed and sad and the series of events that were happening and so I too couldn’t carry the conversation. He didn’t even drop a casual compliment. He casually mentioned “aap log bhi aaoge humaare yaha” I couldn’t mutter a yes and he repeated himself and I hesitantly said “haan aayenge”. I asked him if I should book the return cab and he immediately agreed like he was waiting for it.

But the next day and the days after, he kept in touch with me the same way he used to do in the US. I asked him bluntly how did he like everything during his visit to our place. He said “badhiya tha. But abhi mummy se discussion ho nahi paya hai” (It was good but I am yet to discuss with my mom). We kept talking for the next couple of days and then I withdrew. Because he wasn’t giving me any clarity. I felt he is hesitant to reject me. So, I pulled the plug and he started clarifying himself that he is not disinterested at all and he was just busy and forgot to bring up what he and his mom had discussed. Finally after a lot of stressful drama over this me and my parents visited his house last Sunday. 

At his house, when both of us were asked to talk in private, I emphasised if he is interested to marry at all? As I never saw any enthusiasm or excitement from him. He clarified himself in detail that it doesn’t ‘click’ to him in personal relationships. He said he can do what is to be done if nudged but it doesn’t occur to him by itself naturally. He reassured that it is not his disinterest. He asked me if me and my family had come with any “preparation”, I said no because of your behaviour, I asked my parents to not do a roka for now. When we went back to the drawing room where everyone else was, his mom insisted that a roka be done as he was flying back to the US the next day. My dad politely refused by saying we like the alliance but we need more time and we haven’t come with preparations for a roka. 

We are still talking over the phone and we have asked for a month’s time to decide. 

My problem with him is: He has never complimented me, never flirted even the slightest, never held hands, talks to me on the phone without never paying full attention to me. Is he shy? Or gay? I expect some flirting/romantic vibe at this stage. Am I expecting too much?",4,1754536826.0,Arrangedmarriage,20,0.83,False

**The Problem with Sign Violations in NYC**

If you run a business in New York City, you know how important signage is. But what you may not know—until it’s too late—is how easy it is to end up with a violation. One morning you arrive at your shop or office and find a bright yellow violation sticker from the Department of Buildings (DOB) slapped on your door. It’s a frustrating, often expensive surprise that no business owner wants to deal with.

Sign violations in NYC can cost thousands in fines and even lead to forced removals or shutdowns. Whether it's an unpermitted sign, a structure that's too large, or an installation that violates safety codes, the city doesn't play around when it comes to enforcement. And the worst part? Most of these violations happen because business owners simply don’t know the rules.

**Why Tru-Art Sign Co. Is the Go-To Solution**

Enter Tru-Art Sign Co.—your trusted expert for fast, efficient, and professional [**violation removal in NYC**](https://www.truartsignco.com/violations-or-permits/). With decades of experience navigating the city’s complex signage regulations, Tru-Art has helped hundreds of businesses resolve violations, avoid massive fines, and get back to business without the headaches.

Unlike companies that offer only partial solutions, Tru-Art handles every part of the process. From understanding your violation notice to repairing, replacing, or legalizing your signage, they make the problem go away—fast and hassle-free. They're not just experts—they’re your advocate in dealing with the city.

**Understanding NYC Sign Violations**

**Common Causes of Violations**

NYC signage laws are some of the most detailed and restrictive in the country. Business owners often fall into traps without realizing it, leading to violations such as:

* Installing signs without a permit
* Exceeding allowable size or height
* Using prohibited lighting or materials
* Mounting signs in restricted zones or historical districts
* Failing to display the contractor’s name or DOB license on the sign

Sometimes violations result from previous owners or contractors who cut corners, leaving you to deal with the fallout. The NYC DOB doesn’t care who caused the problem—they hold the current property or business owner responsible.

**Impact on Businesses**

Getting hit with a sign violation is more than just an inconvenience. It can directly impact your operations. In some cases, it can:

* Lead to immediate fines from $800 to $10,000 or more
* Affect your ability to obtain or renew business licenses
* Create legal liabilities if your sign is deemed unsafe
* Damage your business reputation

And because violations are public record, they can also scare away potential customers, investors, or partners. In a competitive market like NYC, that kind of damage is hard to recover from.

**Types of Sign Violations Issued by the DOB**

**Illegal Installations**

One of the most common reasons businesses receive violations is for signs installed without the proper permits. If a sign goes up without DOB approval, even if it seems harmless, it’s considered illegal and subject to removal and fines.

**Lack of Permits**

Even minor signage changes—like replacing a letter or adding illumination—may require a permit. Skipping this step can lead to a Notice of Violation (NOV), often followed by an Environmental Control Board (ECB) or Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH) summons.

**Safety Code Violations**

Signs must meet strict safety standards. That includes structural integrity, electrical wiring, and weatherproofing. Any installation that poses a risk to public safety—like a loose, hanging sign or outdated electrical box—will be flagged.

**Over-Sized Signage**

NYC signage regulations also dictate the maximum allowable size for commercial signs based on zoning, location, and building size. Oversized signs often trigger violations, especially in mixed-use or residential-adjacent zones.

**Why You Should Act Fast**

**Fines and Penalties**

Time is money, and nowhere is that truer than in NYC’s violation system. Ignoring a sign violation doesn’t make it disappear—it just makes it worse. Daily fines accumulate quickly, and a simple oversight can snowball into a $10,000+ problem.

The longer you wait, the more complex the situation becomes. In some cases, the city may issue a “Cure” period, giving you a short window to fix the problem before penalties hit. Miss that deadline, and you’re in for serious financial trouble.

**Business Disruption**

A violation can prevent you from advertising effectively, opening a new location, or completing renovations. Some violations even halt operations entirely until the issue is resolved. For retail stores, restaurants, and small businesses, this downtime is devastating.

Tru-Art helps businesses act fast to minimize financial damage and keep operations running smoothly. Their team understands the urgency and offers priority service for businesses under violation.

**How Tru-Art Handles Violation Removal**

**Step-by-Step Process**

When you partner with Tru-Art, they take full ownership of the violation removal process. Here’s how it works:

1. **Violation Assessment:** Tru-Art reviews the DOB notice and inspects your current signage setup.
2. **Compliance Strategy:** They create a step-by-step plan to bring your sign into full compliance.
3. **Permit Filing:** Their team handles all permit applications, plans, and filings with the DOB.
4. **Corrective Work:** Whether it’s a simple fix or a complete redesign, Tru-Art executes the work quickly and safely.
5. **Inspections & Clearance:** They schedule final inspections and make sure the violation is officially cleared from your record.

**Liaising with the NYC DOB**

Tru-Art speaks the language of bureaucracy. They have long-standing relationships with DOB officials and experience dealing with zoning boards, inspectors, and engineers. This inside knowledge speeds up the process, avoids missteps, and ensures your case is handled professionally from day one.

They also provide all the necessary paperwork—engineering reports, diagrams, affidavits—to document the fix and satisfy city requirements.

**Permit Expediting and Filing**

**Fast-Tracking Approvals**

Navigating the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) can feel like running a bureaucratic marathon—but Tru-Art Sign Co. is your shortcut. With years of experience and strong connections within city departments, they specialize in expediting the permit process, turning weeks of waiting into just days where possible.

From completing accurate filings to submitting architectural drawings and engineering reports, Tru-Art ensures that every document is compliant, professional, and submitted properly the first time. They know what the DOB looks for and avoid common red flags that delay approval.

Whether you’re correcting a violation or applying for a new sign permit, their team manages the entire process, including:

* Certificate of Correction submissions
* Landmark Preservation Commission filings
* Community Board approvals (where required)
* Building and zoning code analysis

**Documentation & Plans**

One of the most important parts of the permitting process is having a detailed and DOB-compliant plan set. Tru-Art collaborates with licensed engineers and architects to produce high-quality drawings and specifications. This includes sign dimensions, materials, lighting methods, mounting hardware, and structural integrity reports.

Having clean, well-organized documentation not only speeds up approvals but also ensures you stay clear of future violations.

**Corrective Construction and Repairs**

**Bringing Signs into Compliance**

Once the paperwork is approved, the next step is physical correction. Tru-Art has a full team of certified installers, technicians, and fabricators who can make whatever changes are needed to bring your signage into full compliance. Whether that means resizing, relocating, or replacing parts of the sign—or the whole thing—they get it done quickly and correctly.

Corrective construction might include:

* Adjusting the height or position of a sign
* Removing unauthorized lighting components
* Reinforcing or anchoring hardware
* Repairing damage caused by improper installation

They always use materials that meet current building and fire safety codes, ensuring your new signage passes final inspection with no issues.

**Ensuring Safety and Code Standards**

In NYC, public safety is a top priority, especially in high-foot-traffic areas. Tru-Art adheres to OSHA guidelines, electrical codes, and DOB regulations during every stage of the repair process. This not only satisfies the city—it protects your customers and your business from potential liabilities.

They also provide post-installation inspections, load tests (when required), and documentation packages so you have proof of compliance if requested by DOB officials in the future.

**Custom Sign Replacement Services**

**Designing New, Code-Compliant Signs**

Sometimes, the only way to resolve a sign violation is to remove the existing sign and start fresh. Tru-Art offers complete custom sign design services that not only resolve violations but also improve your branding in the process.

They don't just slap up a sign that meets code—they work with you to design something beautiful, functional, and on-brand. Their creative team delivers:

* 3D renderings and mockups
* ADA-compliant designs
* Neighborhood-style-consistent visuals
* High-contrast readability

Every new sign is designed with DOB approval in mind from the start, which eliminates future headaches and potential violations.

**Upgrading While Fixing**

Violation removal is also a great opportunity to upgrade. Why not turn a problem into a branding win? Tru-Art clients often take this chance to:

* Refresh outdated or worn signage
* Add new lighting features
* Improve visibility and readability
* Rebrand entirely

Tru-Art helps you think strategically, so you walk away with more than just a fixed problem—you get a major business boost.

**Understanding DOB ECB/OATH Summonses**

**What They Are**

When the NYC DOB issues a sign violation, it’s often accompanied by a summons to the Environmental Control Board (ECB), now known as the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH). This legal notice requires you to either fix the issue by a certain deadline or appear in court to defend your case.

Failure to comply can result in default judgments, increased fines, and additional penalties—sometimes even court-ordered sign removals. These summonses are serious and require professional handling.

**How Tru-Art Resolves Them**

Tru-Art has extensive experience resolving ECB/OATH violations quickly and legally. They handle:

* Submitting Certificates of Correction
* Coordinating with legal counsel if needed
* Providing engineering affidavits or visual evidence
* Ensuring the violation is marked ""complied"" in the city database

Once corrected, they follow through until the violation is officially closed. This avoids lingering issues that can interfere with loans, lease renewals, or property sales.

**Working Within Landmark Districts**

**Navigating Landmark Preservation Commission Rules**

NYC is home to hundreds of designated historic districts, and signage regulations in these areas are even stricter. You can't just throw up a neon sign on a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights or install aluminum letters in SoHo without LPC (Landmarks Preservation Commission) approval.

Tru-Art specializes in creating signs that comply with LPC guidelines while still maintaining brand integrity. They know how to:

* Submit landmark-specific design proposals
* Use approved materials and construction methods
* Retain architectural aesthetics of historical buildings

**Historic Sign Compatibility**

Instead of clashing with the surrounding architecture, Tru-Art designs signs that blend beautifully with historic facades. Think hand-painted signs, gold leaf lettering, cast bronze plaques, or weathered wood textures—classic styles that get approval and admiration.

Whether you're restoring a vintage sign or installing a new one in a protected district, Tru-Art ensures it’s done right.

**Why Choose Tru-Art for Violation Removal**

**Experience and NYC Expertise**

[**Tru-Art Sign Co**](https://www.truartsignco.com/long-island-ny/). has been serving the New York City business community for decades, and they’ve seen it all—from minor decal violations to full-blown sign overhauls due to outdated structures. Their deep understanding of NYC’s ever-evolving signage laws gives them a clear edge over generic sign companies.

They’re not just technicians—they’re compliance strategists, city liaisons, and creative problem solvers. Every member of their team is trained to handle DOB filings, interpret zoning code, and execute installation or removal work with speed and precision.

Because they specialize in violation removal, their process is laser-focused on efficiency. They know which departments to contact, how to streamline corrections, and—most importantly—how to make violations go away without disrupting your business.

**Full-Service from Start to Finish**

Most companies will either fix the sign or file the paperwork—but rarely both. Tru-Art is a one-stop shop. From the moment you receive a violation, they handle everything:

* Site inspection
* Legal compliance check
* Plan preparation
* Permit filing
* Violation correction or full sign replacement
* Final inspection and clearance

Their holistic approach means you won’t waste time coordinating multiple vendors or learning complex DOB terminology. You focus on your business—they’ll handle the city.

**Case Studies: Successful Violation Removals**

**Small Businesses**

**Example: Harlem Coffee Shop**

A trendy café in Harlem received a violation for having an over-sized, non-permitted LED sign installed by a freelance contractor. Tru-Art came in, removed the existing sign, designed a new storefront sign that complied with size restrictions, filed all necessary DOB permits, and completed installation in under three weeks. The café never had to close, and their new sign actually attracted more foot traffic.

**Result:** Violation cleared, fines avoided, brand visibility improved.

**Commercial Properties**

**Example: Midtown Office Building**

A commercial landlord received multiple violations across tenants for non-uniform, outdated signage in a Class A building. Tru-Art developed a signage master plan that aligned all signs with building code and tenant brand guidelines. They replaced 12 signs across multiple floors, coordinated with the DOB and LPC (since the building was landmarked), and had all ECB violations dismissed.

**Result:** Property value increased, building aesthetics improved, and no outstanding violations on record.

These real-world results are why Tru-Art is trusted by everyone from mom-and-pop shops to real estate investment firms.

**Avoiding Future Violations**

**Regular Maintenance**

Once your violation is cleared, Tru-Art doesn’t just disappear. They offer regular maintenance packages to inspect, clean, and repair your signage before issues arise. Routine maintenance catches problems early, such as:

* Fading or cracking materials
* Electrical issues in illuminated signs
* Structural wear and tear

This proactive approach prevents violations, extends the life of your sign, and saves money in the long run.

Think of it as a “compliance audit” for your signage plans. It’s how Tru-Art ensures your sign not only looks great but never triggers a surprise visit from the DOB.

**Cost of Violation Removal in NYC**

**Factors That Affect Price**

Violation removal costs vary based on several key factors:

Most projects range from **$1,500 to $10,000**, depending on complexity.

**FAQs**

**1. What is a DOB sign violation in NYC?**

A DOB (Department of Buildings) violation is issued when signage is installed or maintained in a way that violates NYC building or zoning codes. This can include size, lighting, placement, or lack of permits.

**2. How much does it cost to remove a sign violation in NYC?**

The cost typically ranges from $1,500 to $10,000, depending on severity, scope of work, and whether the sign must be replaced or repaired.

**3. Can I fix the sign violation myself?**

It's not recommended. DIY fixes may not meet code, and you could face further fines. Always work with a licensed, experienced professional like Tru-Art to ensure proper compliance.

**4. How long does it take to resolve a sign violation?**

Most violations can be resolved within 2 to 6 weeks, depending on how quickly permits are processed and the complexity of the work involved.

1mjp93q,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1mjp93q/foreigners_getting_married_in_japan_heres_what/,Foreigners getting married in Japan? Here’s what actually works (photographer’s 2025 guide),"**My background and experience with this**

I’m James, a UK-born photographer now based in Australia, and Japan is one of my busiest destinations. In the past few seasons I’ve helped couples file paperwork in Tokyo ward offices, organised Shinto blessings in Kyoto shrines, planned symbolic mountaintop vows in Nagano and shot partnership-certificate ceremonies for LGBTQIA+ pairs in Osaka. After watching so many people wrestle with conflicting internet advice, I wrote down the clear, current process I give my clients so they can focus on ramen rather than red tape.

**Choose your legal route**

Start by deciding which of four paths fits you. Two non-Japanese partners can register a marriage entirely in Japan by handing in a kon’in todoke at any city or ward office; once the clerk stamps it the marriage is fully recognised under Japanese law. A mixed couple, where one partner is Japanese, uses the same form but must add a freshly issued copy of the Japanese partner’s family register - the koseki tohon - plus photo ID. Same-sex couples cannot obtain a nationwide marriage yet, but more than fifty municipalities issue partnership certificates that unlock rights such as joint tenancy and hospital visitation; most pairs back that up with a legal ceremony in their home country, so the status travels internationally. Many couples skip overseas bureaucracy completely and come to Japan for a purely symbolic celebration - shrine ritual, alpine lake vows or neon rooftop vows - while handling legal paperwork at home.

**The paperwork you carry**

For the fully legal routes each partner needs a passport and photocopy, a Certificate of No Impediment (sometimes called a single-status affidavit) dated within the past three months and, even if the clerk claims it is optional, a birth certificate because requirements change by ward. Every non-Japanese document must be translated into Japanese, yet self-translation is acceptable if each page is signed and dated. Two adult witnesses aged twenty or older must appear with ID; they can be friends, vendors or the friendly traveller you met in the hostel lounge. If one partner is Japanese that fresh koseki tohon is mandatory. Scanning everything to cloud storage before you fly means a lost suitcase cannot wreck the day.

**Filling in the kon’in todoke**

Download the bilingual PDF, print it and fill it out over hotel coffee instead of hunching at the public counter. Names go in block capitals with a katakana version underneath - clerks genuinely appreciate the clarity. Japanese forms list the surname first, so double-check every field before you put pen to paper.

**What happens at the counter**

On filing day, walk to the family-register window marked koseki-ka, hand over passports, translations, witness IDs and the completed form, then wait while the clerk flips through the bundle. If everything is correct, you usually hear the approval stamp within ten to thirty minutes. Certified copies of your Japanese marriage certificate cost only loose change, so buy at least two. Before leaving ask for the Certificate of Acceptance of Notification of Marriage because banks, immigration officers and name-change offices care far more about that plain sheet than the decorative parchment you will frame later. By the time you reach the nearest ramen shop you are legally married.

**Making the marriage portable**

Once you have the certificate, translate at least one copy back into English if your home country needs it, then legalise another copy with an apostille at your embassy in Tokyo or via courier while you honeymoon elsewhere. Most embassies stamp documents the same day if you arrive early. When you get home lodge the apostilled certificate with local authorities so the marriage is recognised everywhere from immigration to banks.

**A calm timeline**

Roughly four months before departure order the Certificate of No Impediment and check embassy opening hours so you don’t arrive during a public holiday. Two months out finish translations, download the kon’in todoke and confirm witnesses. One month before the trip print everything twice and ensure nothing has expired. During the week of filing scout photo locations and make sure the city hall is not closing for a festival - Golden Week from 29 April to 5 May catches a lot of couples. On the day itself half an hour at the counter is usually all it takes.

**What it really costs in 2025**

Submitting the kon’in todoke is free. Two certified copies run about seven hundred yen total. An apostille at the UK embassy sits just over seven thousand yen. A traditional Shinto ceremony with kimono rental averages around one hundred thousand yen, while a popular garden photo permit sits near ten thousand yen. Even after adding flights many couples spend less than they would on a registry-office ceremony and pub lunch back home.

**Picking the right season**

Late March to early April brings the iconic cherry blossoms, but tourist spots are crowded and dawn shoots are common. May and early June offer lush greenery, moderate prices and only the first hints of rainy season toward the end of June. Mid-October through late November lights up with red maples and comfortable temperatures, although local couples love autumn too so venues book quickly. December to February means crystal skies, snow-capped Fuji views and very short daylight; hand-warmers and early ceremony slots are essential.

**Field-tested hacks from the job**

Print two sets of every document because public copiers accept only ten-yen coins and jam at the worst moment. Pick up clear bubble umbrellas at Daiso for three hundred yen so drizzle won’t ruin photos. Slip chemical heat packs into kimono obi or suit pockets for winter shoots. Keep a roll of double-sided kimono tape on hand; it fixes everything from rogue lapels to bouquet ribbons.

I keep a printable checklist, translation templates and a shortlist of ceremony spots in my profile if you want extra detail, but the essentials are all here. Happy planning, and feel free to drop questions below - I’ll help where I can.",27,1754536765.0,JapanTravelTips,2,0.85,False
1mjp7xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dubaiwiki/comments/1mjp7xu/exploring_the_vibrant_majlis_culture_of_the_uae/,Exploring the Vibrant Majlis Culture of the UAE," In the heart of the United Arab Emirates,where tradition meets modernity, lies a cultural gem that has fostered community, hospitality, and connection for centuries: the majlis. This cherished institution is more than just a physical space—it’s a vibrant expression of Emirati heritage, a hub for social interaction, and a symbol of the UAE’s deep-rooted values of generosity and togetherness. Let’s dive into the world of the majlis and discover why it remains a cornerstone of Emirati life.

What is a Majlis?

The word ""majlis"" translates to ""a place of sitting"" in Arabic, and it perfectly captures the essence of this cultural practice. A majlis is a designated room or area, often in an Emirati home or community space, where people gather to discuss matters of importance, share stories, or simply enjoy each other’s company. Traditionally, it’s a space where hospitality reigns supreme, and guests are treated with warmth, respect, and an abundance of refreshments.
From the outside, a majlis might appear as a simple room adorned with plush cushions, intricate carpets, and low seating arrangements, but its significance runs much deeper. It’s a space where hierarchies blur, voices are heard, and bonds are strengthened—whether among family, friends, or even strangers.

A Historical Anchor

The majlis has its roots in Bedouin traditions, where tribal leaders would host gatherings to resolve disputes, share news, or welcome travelers. In a desert environment where survival depended on community, the majlis was a vital institution for fostering unity and mutual support. Over time, as the UAE transformed into a modern nation, the majlis evolved while retaining its core purpose: to bring people together.
Today, majlis culture is as relevant as ever. In cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, you’ll find both traditional majlises in homes and modern iterations in public spaces, such as cultural centers or even hotels, where the spirit of the majlis is preserved for locals and visitors alike.

The Anatomy of a Majlis
Step into a majlis, and you’ll immediately feel the warmth of Emirati hospitality. The setup is designed for comfort and connection. Low, cushioned seating lines the walls, encouraging face-to-face interaction. Intricate rugs and traditional decorations, such as lanterns or calligraphy, create an inviting ambiance. The air is often scented with oud, a fragrant incense that adds to the sensory experience.
No majlis is complete without an array of refreshments. Guests are greeted with gahwa (Arabic coffee), served in small handleless cups, accompanied by dates or sweets. The act of pouring and sharing coffee is a ritual in itself, symbolizing respect and welcome. Depending on the occasion, you might also enjoy luqaimat (sweet dumplings), fresh fruits, or other traditional delicacies.

A Space for Connection
The majlis is more than a physical space—it’s a social institution that reflects the UAE’s values of inclusivity and generosity. It’s where families gather to celebrate milestones, where neighbors resolve disputes, and where strangers become friends. In a majlis, everyone is equal, and every voice matters. Whether it’s a casual catch-up or a serious discussion about community matters, the majlis fosters open dialogue and mutual respect.
For Emiratis, the majlis is also a space to preserve traditions. Elders share stories of the past, passing down wisdom to younger generations. Poetry recitals, known as nabati, are a common feature, celebrating the UAE’s rich literary heritage. During Ramadan, majlises take on an even more special role, hosting iftar gatherings where families and friends break their fast together, reinforcing the sense of community.

The Modern Majlis
While rooted in tradition, the majlis has adapted to the UAE’s cosmopolitan present. Today, you’ll find majlises in various forms—some are private, hosted in homes, while others are public, organized by cultural institutions or government bodies to promote dialogue and cultural exchange. For example, the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding in Dubai hosts open majlises where visitors can engage with Emirati hosts, ask questions, and learn about local customs over coffee and dates.
The majlis has also inspired modern design trends. Many UAE homes now feature contemporary majlis rooms with sleek furniture and cutting-edge technology, blending tradition with luxury. Even in corporate settings, businesses have embraced the majlis concept, creating meeting spaces that echo its spirit of collaboration and hospitality.
Why the Majlis Matters
In a fast-paced world dominated by digital communication, the majlis stands as a reminder of the power of face-to-face connection. It’s a space where time slows down, where people listen to one another, and where hospitality is an art form. For Emiratis, the majlis is a living tradition that bridges the past and the present, ensuring that the values of community and generosity remain at the heart of UAE society.
For visitors, experiencing a majlis is a window into the soul of the UAE. It’s a chance to witness the warmth and openness that define Emirati culture. Whether you’re sipping gahwa in a traditional home or attending a cultural majlis in a bustling city, you’re participating in a timeless ritual that celebrates human connection.
Conclusion
The majlis is more than a room—it’s a heartbeat of Emirati culture, pulsating with stories, laughter, and shared moments. It’s where the UAE’s past and present converge, where strangers become friends, and where the simple act of sitting together becomes a profound expression of unity. So, the next time you’re in the UAE, seek out a majlis, sip some gahwa, and immerse yourself in the vibrant culture that makes this nation so unique. You’ll leave not just with a full stomach but with a fuller heart.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Seattle Mariners vs. Chicago White Sox: A Tale of Two Teams (and One Very Tired Pitcher)**  
The Seattle Mariners, fresh off their 61-53 résumé, host the Chicago White Sox (42-71), a team that’s playing baseball like it’s a game of “how many losses can we stack before the clock strikes midnight?” First pitch is 9:40 p.m. ET at T-Mobile Park, where the Mariners’ offense is as reliable as a Seattle drizzle in March—ubiquitous, and best avoided if you’re a White Sox pitcher.

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Mariners Are the Favorite

The Mariners (-1.5 runs, 1.34 decimal odds) are the clear chalk here, with an implied probability of **74.6%** to win. The White Sox (+1.5, 3.35 odds) have a laughably low **29.9%** chance, which is about the same odds of me explaining the plot of *The Room* without making a face. Statistically, this is a mismatch. Seattle’s 8.5-run differential (61-53 vs. 42-71) is like a heavyweight champion facing a sumo wrestler who’s trying to diet.

On the mound, George Kirby (6-5, 4.12 ERA) seeks his 13th straight start of five or more innings. His 9.3 strikeouts per nine innings are sharper than a Seattle knife at a rain-soaked Mariners game. Meanwhile, Jonathan Cannon (4-8, 4.77 ERA) brings a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 2.34, which is less “dominant” and more “why is this pitcher’s name a brand of weak coffee?” Cannon’s ERA is 0.65 worse than Kirby’s, and his control? Well, if walking batters were Olympic sport, he’d be a gold medalist.

### News Digest: Injuries, Struggles, and Why the White Sox Should Pack a Towel

The Mariners’ key hitters—Cal Raleigh (42 HRs, 88 RBIs), Eugenio Suarez (.243 AVG), and Josh Naylor (.284 AVG)—are as reliable as a coffee shop in downtown Seattle. No major injuries here, just a team clicking like a well-oiled espresso machine.

&nbsp;

Central City was never quiet for long.

Wally West raced down 110th Avenue, a streak of red and silver against the city blur. Sparks danced from his boots. The insignia on his chest - white lightning over crimson - gleamed in the daylight.

He spun past a collapsing building facade, weaving through falling bricks at inhuman pace. His eyes locked on the nearest threat - the next of many chrome, sword-wielding warriors to take down. The Samuroid’s robotic arm was outstretched, its humming katana blade thrusted toward a mother shielding her son.

“Not today,” Wally muttered.

He surged forward, planted one foot on a fire hydrant, flipped skyward with enough torque to bend the air, and ricocheted off a lamppost, accelerating with keen precision. He struck the Samuroid full-force in the chest. Sparks burst from its chest as it crashed backward, sword clanging to the street.

Wally grinned to himself as the civilians scarpered to safety. ""No problem.”

Then another Samuroid rose behind him - until a silver blur sliced clean through it.

“Zoom,” Wally said, catching his breath.

William West stood in the smoking remains, brushing dust off his shoulder like it bored him. “Flash,” he smirked in return.

“I had it handled,” Wally shook his head with a chuckle, watching the two civilians rush off to safety.

“Yeah, well,” William smirked, as he looked out to the dozen other Samurai androids striding forth ominously. “We were in the area.”

Icy wind curled down from above. Captain Cold slid down an icy ramp of his own creation, carrying him from atop the opposite building to the street. His hands exuded frosty air, his powers good for much more than a dramatic entrance. “Miss us?”

A single fireball burst forth from a nearby alley, striking one android in the chest. Heat Wave followed closely behind, ready to fling plenty more.

Then the sky darkened. A fierce tempest struck the square, prompting the Samuroids to dig in to keep their footing, their gyroscopes working overtime all at once. On the opposite side of the Samuroids appeared Weather Wizard, her every movement controlling the winds.

New Rogues approached the small army of Samuroids in lockstep, daring them to strike. Wally couldn’t help the grin creeping onto his face.

William shot him a look. “Take off, Flash. We’ve got this handled.”

Wally hesitated.

“You’ve got somewhere to be,” William added. “I’ll swing by when we’re done.”

Wally watched the scene unfold before him: Samuroids clashed with flame and ice, with wind and lightning. The fight was far from done, but his home had more than enough champions dedicated to its protection.

He took a breath, and then he ran.



&nbsp;

🔻🔺 ⚡ 🔺🔻

&nbsp;


Wally stepped through the door of his apartment, a faint electric hum trailing behind him, his costume dissolving into the ether just as quickly as he was able to summon it. The familiar scent of melted cheese and garlic hit him instantly. His shoulders dropped, tension bleeding away.

“Sorry I’m late, work was…” he called, already shrugging off his coat and letting it fall over the hook by the door.

*Chaos*, he finished silently. The streets had been crawling with Samuroids. But taking them down was hardly an issue. In the 25th century, taking on the role of the Flash was nothing more than an obligation, something he did because the world didn’t have anyone else. Something he never felt like he deserved. This, he dared to think, was different. It was fulfilling in a way the future had never been. That had been about getting by, surviving, and preventing catastrophe. This was about doing what he was born to do, in the place he was meant to be. Saving people. Making a difference. Making Barry proud.

He rounded the corner and stopped. His humble apartment was far fuller than he expected. Pizza boxes sprawled across the dining table, half-eaten slices already vanishing into a crowd of familiar faces. His aunt Iris waved him in from the far end, a six-month-old Jacob bouncing on her lap as Patty fussed with a sippy cup. Tina McGee raised her bottle of soda in greeting. His great-uncle Joe was leaning against the far wall, laughing at something the teenaged Bart had just said. And sitting at the edge of the couch was something he hadn’t seen in years.

“Avery!” Wally’s eyes lit up as he crossed the room and pulled her into a hug. “It’s so great to see you!”

“It’s been too long,” she grinned, hugging him back tightly.

“How’s it going in China?” he asked.

“Put it this way: I’m keeping my cell close in case anyone calls. One speedster for a whole country is one hell of a job.”

Wally laughed, stepping back.

Avery gestured around the room. “I wouldn’t miss today. Not for anything.” Her voice dipped slightly. “He was a hard-ass. But… well, he was a hero. To all of us.”

Everyone nodded. A gentle, solemn silence followed. Six months without Barry. And, as much as they all rallied together, it didn’t dull the ache they all felt as they mourned him.

Wally took a seat beside Bart and Tina, glancing toward the door. “William’s en route. Got held up.”

Patty chuckled from across the room. “You’re both just like Barry.”

Wally raised an eyebrow. “Late?”

That got a full laugh from the room. Even baby Jacob squealed.

Joe stepped forward, clapping Bart on the shoulder. “Hey, kid. You got the Nintendo set up?”

Bart spun around, already holding out a controller. “Mario Kart good for you?”

Joe grinned. “You’re on.”

William arrived within the hour, the Samuroids all defeated. It wasn’t long until he was having an overdue conversation with Avery, trying to keep things light, both a little stiff in their body language but determined to catch up on what they had missed in each other’s lives. On the sofa, Patty and Bart wrestled with an unopened bottle of white wine, both red-faced from the effort and determined to open it without their powers. Dr McGee gently rocked baby Jacob in her arms, whispering softly to him as if he might understand. The coffee table was crowded with paper plates, pizza crusts, and soda cans, while the air hummed with the low static of good company.

Wally stood apart, half-shadowed by the window, his eyes trained on the endless trail of traffic winding through Central City. The cars didn’t stop. Not really. One stream slowed down, another picked up. The lights changed, the honking started again. It never ended. In Blue Valley, Nebraska, home had moved at a slower pace, but Wally had been trapped in an agonisingly slow existence enough for one lifetime already.

“Six months as the Flash,” Iris said gently as she came up beside him. “How you holding up?”

Wally didn’t look away from the street. “Well, I’m meeting up with Hartley this weekend,” he said. “Only a few months left on my engineering course, and I'm looking to trade this place for a bigger apartment at the end of the month.”

Iris chuckled. “I did mean fighting crime, stopping bad guys, saving people.”

Wally smiled faintly. “I’m faster than could possibly make sense,” he said. “Saving people is the easy part.”

“Barry said the same.” Her smile dimmed. They were fond memories, but painful ones. “Have you gone to see him today?”

“At the cemetery?"" Wally glanced at her, then back to the street. “No. I told you, he’s not there.”

“I know he’s isn't but… well, neither was his dad Jay, but Barry visited his grave. Said it made him feel close to him.”

Wally’s breath caught slightly. The city was loud, alive, relentless, but inside him was a small, quiet hum - a spark, a pulse. “I do feel close to him,” he said. “No matter where I am.”

Iris reached over, squeezed his arm. Her hand was warm, her smile tremulous. They stood together in silence, the crowd behind them fading into a distant murmur.

Then, after a long beat, she said what she had been afraid to say. “Have you wondered why we’re still here?”

Wally turned to her, frowning. “What do you mean?”

“I mean… after everything. The Reverse Flash’s experiment. The timeline changes. Why haven’t we been erased?”

Before he could answer, the sky outside cracked open.

A crack of lightning, sharp and sudden, without any overture of warning. It struck the middle of the street, like the gods had thrown a match.

Wally’s eyes snapped wide. The road outside was packed with cars, horns already starting to blare. Without a word, he vanished, a red-silver blur leaving Iris behind as the curtains fluttered in the vacuum of his wake.

On the scene in less than a second, five streaks of lightning tore down the block - red, silver, gold, violet, and blue. Wally, William, Bart, Avery, and Patty each peeled people from their cars with flawless synchronicity, sweeping pedestrians off the sidewalk, pulling drivers from seatbelts, catching a toddler mid-fall as a panicked father tripped over the kerb.

Seconds later, the lightning-struck car exploded into a rolling fireball.

The speedsters kept moving, a cyclone of colour carving through the chaos. They moved people two, three blocks away, past the bakeries and barbershops, and didn’t stop until they were sure the blast radius was empty. Wally was the first to circle back.

The flames had spread, leaping from car to car. Wally straightened his back and whipped his arms into tight, controlled circles, forming twin vortexes that snuffed the blaze car by car. In seconds, the block was quiet again, albeit scorched.

Then came Patty’s voice. “Wally!” she cried out.

He spun around. “What—?”

He saw her standing frozen, her eyes locked on the wreckage. On the roof of the car where the lightning had struck.

Wally followed her gaze.

A figure stood atop the twisted metal, unmoving but blurred, vibrating so fast he was little more than a silhouette, his entire frame haloed in electricity. White lightning crawled across his skin. Wally couldn’t make out the face, not at first.

Then the man slowed. His molecules settled. The blurring faded away.

It was Barry.

In plain clothes. No suit. No mask. No warning.

Patty gasped, then ran. “Barry!” she screamed. She launched herself into his arms, clutching him like she was afraid he’d vanish if she blinked. Her sobs shook her whole body.

Wally couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.

In the doorway of the apartment, Dr McGee’s hand flew to her mouth. Joe staggered forward in disbelief. Iris cast a look down at baby Jacob in her arms and then back up at the man she thought she’d never see again.

“Here,” Barry whispered to Patty, gently guiding her down from the car. “Come on. Let’s get away from this.” His voice was soft.

He stepped down from the wreckage and gestured toward Wally’s window. “Let’s go inside.”


&nbsp;

🔻🔺 ⚡ 🔺🔻

&nbsp;


The apartment was so quiet you could hear the hum of the refrigerator. Everyone sat on the edge of their seats. Even little Jacob had gone quiet in Patty’s arms, entranced by the strange energy of the room.

Barry sat on the couch, visibly exhausted but calm, a glass of water in his hand. Wally stood nearby, arms crossed, still half unsure this was real.

“I don’t know how to explain it,” Barry began. “When I ran into the rift… I expected to die. I felt myself coming apart, *atom by atom*, until there was no me anymore.”

Patty clutched her baby son closer.

“But then I was somewhere else,” Barry continued. “Alive. Whole. Standing in a city I didn’t recognise. No wreckage, no pain, just… strange buildings and people with technology I couldn’t understand.”

William frowned. “The future?”

Barry nodded. “The 31st century.”

There were stunned looks all around. William carried on. “But… you had to give yourself to the Speed Force to stabilise the explosion.”

“I did,” Barry said. “I felt it happen. I became one with the Speed Force. In an instant, I saw things I can’t even describe - the history of the multiverse playing out like film reels around me. I saw Dad. And Max.”

He smirked faintly. “But then… something strange happened. I was stable. At peace. And then I wasn’t. It was like I slipped through a crack in the Speed Force itself. Like I was out of phase with reality. And when I came to… I was in the 31st century.”

A light went on in Wally’s eyes.

“*108 kilohertz*,” he said.

Barry blinked. “What?”

“*The difference between riding the Speed Force home and being torn atom from atom*,” Wally murmured, half quoting Professor Thawne. “It worked.”

“You did this?” Barry went quiet as he remembered his final exchange with Wally, and the spark that moved between them.

Patty turned to Wally too, the breath almost beaten out of her by shock. “I think he did.”

Without another word, Barry stood and threw his arms around Wally, gripping him tight. “Thank you,” he said. “Thank you for bringing me home.”

The whole room didn’t dare to breathe. Then Patty’s voice came, gentle but certain. “The Reverse Flash said Wally almost never survived his journey to the future and back.”

Barry stepped back, meeting her eyes. “That was the variable,” he said. “This time around, everything worked out.”

He looked back to Wally, beaming. “Because you lived.”

Wally, flustered, held up his hands. “We all did our part.”

But Barry was already shaking his head. “Maybe so,” he said. “But you brought me back home.”


&nbsp;

🔻🔺 ⚡ 🔺🔻

&nbsp;



By eleven o’ clock, only four remained in the apartment: Wally, Barry, Patty, and baby Jacob, who lay nestled against his mother’s chest, his little hand batting the air.

“Six months…” Barry said softly, his eyes unfocused. “I’m sorry I couldn’t come back to the moment I left. I just leapt at the first chance I got to get home.”

“We’re just glad you’re back,” Patty said softly. She looked drained, but joy radiated beneath the fatigue. Jacob cooed, clutching Barry’s finger with surprising strength.

Barry smiled, letting that tiny grip ground him. “I missed this. Missed him.” He glanced to Patty, then Wally. “Missed all of you.” Barry’s heart melted as his eyes met his son’s again for the first time in a long time, knowing he had Jacob’s whole life to make up for the six months he had missed. 

“How did you get back?” Wally asked from the arm of the couch, where he sat sideways, shoulders loose.

“I found him,” Barry said, beaming now. “The future Bart. He ended up in the same time period as me. I was stuck as long as I was because I burned out most of my speed feeding the Speed Force, balancing it out. Eventually, I was strong enough for Bart to give me enough of his to make the trip back.”

“And he’s okay?” Patty asked quickly, her voice hitching.

“More than okay,” Barry said. “He’s got a world to protect. A family. Don’t forget, he was already an old man when I met him in 2019.”

Wally hesitated. A question had haunted him for most of the evening, something he felt guilty for even considering in light of everything. But it was too important to him for him to keep it to himself.

“So… what happens now?” he finally asked.

Barry turned his head slightly. “What do you mean?”

“Well, we’ve got by for the last six months, but you’re back now.” Wally gave a forced, half-nervous smile. “Don’t you want to… you know?”

Barry’s expression softened. “After what the Speed Force took from me, you’re faster than me now, Wally,” he said. “Hell, you might be faster than I ever was, outside of the EMP supercharge. And besides…” he beamed with pride. “It’s like I said inside the particle accelerator. It’s your turn now.”

Wally stared at the floor, overwhelmed. Then he nodded, a slow breath leaving him like a weight lifting from his chest. “Yeah. I’d like that.”

Barry leaned back. “But hey - if it ever gets to be too much, just say the word. I’ll step in. Give you a break.” He looked over to Patty and then back down at the baby in her arms. “But in the meantime, I’ve got a baby to raise.”

He leaned forward, took a deep breath, and promptly recoiled, gagging. “And a diaper to change!”

They all laughed, the sound warm and weary at the end of a long day.

Barry stood, lifting Jacob from Patty’s arms as the baby giggled, babbling nonsense to the ceiling. Wally watched them from the sofa, arms crossed loosely, lightning still tingling faintly in his fingertips. The love that Barry and Patty had for him was immense, like nothing he had known growing up. And there was plenty more from everyone else - chief among them, William and Iris. He couldn’t forget the future either, with Rosie, Jai and Eobard just waiting for him to visit, which he knew he would one day, when he was fast enough.

Once, Wally was a lonely kid who could only dream of going on adventures like his childhood hero. Then he was a time-displaced teen with his whole life snatched away from him. He had survived a difficult childhood, and a tumultuous adolescence that had stretched across centuries. And now, with his hero’s approval, and his own hard-earned self-confidence, he knew his greatest adventures were ahead of him.

Wally looked forward to the future with excitement, ready to weather any storm the universe would throw his way.

Now, he was the Flash.

The Fastest Man Alive.

But the best part?

He would never have to run alone.

1mjp221,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mjp221,Cafe Loft x Gute Leute coffee omakase,"
I got to experience this limited omakase tasting in LA. I reside in Germany most of the year, so I feel very fortunate to have been able to experience this. I didn’t take any photos myself, so I’m using photos from Cafe Loft’s instagram account. I’m not affiliated with them, though I am friends with the owner of Cafe Loft.

I’m normally a plain espresso drinker. Sometimes a long black, very seldom a latte. I saw on their instagram that they were doing this special event while I happened to be in town, so I reserved a spot. It only runs until this Friday, but if you’re in LA, there might still be some spots left.

The omakase is a collaboration between Cafe Loft and Gute Leute. Loft is in LA and GL is based in Seoul, Korea. 

It was a series of drinks that go well with the summer heat. The drinks being a fusion of coffee and Korean culture. 

The first was a palette cleaner. The only drink that wasn’t coffee based. It was a semi sweet Asian pear drink, infused with rosemary. Refreshing and delicious.

Second was a mildly sweetened espresso with pop candies on the side. The espresso was sweetened just enough for it to taste richer, but not so sweet, that I actually had to ask if they added sugar. It was perfect. I was instructed to first drink the espresso by itself, and then try it with the pop rocks. The combination was surprisingly pleasant. This is something you can easily try at home.

Third was a mugwort/coconut cream drink. I’ve known about this he existence of mugwort, as it’s used in Korean rice cakes, but I never knew what it was called in English. The drink without coffee was good, but once you mix a shot of espresso in there, it becomes a really interesting coffee drink. I’ve never thought that the combination of mugwort and coffee would be good, but this drink came together really well. And it was my favorite of the five. Unfortunately, I don’t think this is a drink I could replicate at home. 

Fourth was frozen espresso topped with vegan cream and dried strawberries, with a little bit of thyme (I believe it was). I first chewed on the thyme, then had the strawberry and cream, then tried it all together as instructed. I think the thyme was to cleanse the palette between this and the previous drink as the previous drink was slightly sweet. This is one that would make an interesting desert. 

The last was a mix of coffee and a traditional Korean drink. The visuals on this one was stunning, as they light up the outside. They also burn a bit of cinnamon on the inside to create an aroma. The traditional Korean drink (I forget what it’s called, as I don’t normally drink it. But it’s a sweet ginger cinnamon tea. The aroma, the flavors of the tea mixed with coffee just fused perfectly together. It was delicious, and I’m going to have to learn how to make that tea at home to try to replicate the drink.

The good folks at Gute Leute also hooked me up with some beans and cold brew, because they heard I have a decent espresso machine back in Germany. If I’m ever in Korea, I’m definitely going to check them out. Their creativity really blew my mind. If you’re in Seoul, or ever visiting, I highly recommend them for a different kind of coffee experience.",0,1754536184.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

We met through a playlist.

Not in person. Not in a coffee shop or a party or some cute-ass bookstore. It was late summer and she replied to my playlist post with the caption, “Tell me how it ends without telling me how it ends.”

She said, “It ends with a song you weren’t ready to hear.”

That’s how it started.

She lived hours away. Different cities. Different rhythms. Different kinds of lonely. But something about her felt like a glitch in the system. Like the algorithm brought me someone who spoke in soft chaos. Someone whose silence wasn’t empty, just sacred.

Let’s call her Safi.
Safi was intense without trying. Private but magnetic. She’d say things like, “I don’t like being perceived,” but then look right into your soul with a single text. Her voice was low, careful, thoughtful. Like every word cost her something.

I wasn’t looking for anything serious. Not long-distance. Not a love story. I was just bored, burnt out, using music as a flotation device.

But we started texting. Then calling. Then talking for six hours straight about everything and nothing. She made me laugh in that ugly, unfiltered way. And she made me feel… safe. Like maybe I wasn’t too much. Like all the parts of me people had called dramatic or deep or exhausting were actually meant for someone like her.

We hadn’t even met in person yet.
But I was already falling.

Hard.

One night, during one of those quiet pauses, she said something that stayed with me.

“If you were here, I’d be too shy to touch you. But I’d want to. Every second.”

And I felt that everywhere. Every single place I didn’t know had been aching to be wanted.",0,1754536122.0,BasedOnATrueStory_,0,0.5,False

I usually end up eating between appointments or whenever, like during my commute.

Today for lunch, I had a peanut butter sandwich, an avocado sandwich, a protein bar, a mango, and some disappointingly weak coffee with a lot of Ferrero Rocher for dessert.

Yesterday was worse: I was so hungry and had no time for lunch, so when I finally got home, I ordered a whole medium vegetarian pizza and ate it all, then had a slice of maple walnut coffee cake and a cup of tea. Very proud. :) Stress and crazy schedules sometimes do that to me. I usually do best throughout the day when I have a good, healthy breakfast, but don't always have time for it these days. But things are looking good so hopefully will get back to normal soon, fingers crossed.

Oh, in terms of snacks, I usually snack on Doritos, spicy trail mix, chocolate, dried fruit, and fresh fruit.

1mjoz5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mjoz5d/help_find_this_novel/,Help Find this Novel,"I’m supposed to be at work today, but I traded shifts with a coworker. Instead, I’m kneeling on the floor of one of the upstairs rooms, elbow deep in boxes I’ve meant to clear out for months. Sunlight slants through the window, dust swirling in the beams, and I’m humming to myself, half-lost in the rhythm of an old song looping in my head.

Then the crunch of tires on gravel cuts through my reverie. Curious, I push up onto my knees and peer through the glass. Balen’s car rolls into the driveway. My heart lifts, silly with anticipation—I’m home, unexpectedly, and maybe today he’ll actually be glad to see me. Maybe this time, he’ll want me again. It feels like forever since he last touched me with anything close to tenderness.

I’m about to step away from the window when another engine purrs up behind his. I blink, surprised. Cyrene’s car. My twin. The two of them, home together. For a brief, naive moment, I feel a childish surge of happiness. Funny, looking back, how nothing about this strikes me as odd—not then. I’m too trusting, always have been.

I linger by the window, invisible behind the curtain, watching as Balen steps out and turns toward Cyrene. He’s always kept his distance from her at family gatherings, their glances strange and unreadable, but nothing could have prepared me for what I see now. Cyrene launches herself into his arms, legs locking around his waist, and he catches her easily, kissing her with a hunger that leaves me hollowed out in an instant. A kiss so deep, so desperate, it makes my stomach drop and rage surge hot through my veins.

An affair. Of course. Is this why he hasn’t touched me in months? I choke on a sob, betrayal slicing through me, sharp and raw.

My mind scrambles for proof—anything to stop them from gaslighting me again, from twisting the story until I’m the one left doubting my own eyes. My hands fumble for my phone. I snap photos through the glass, capturing the two of them locked together, oblivious. He lifts her, her legs still cinched around his waist, carrying her toward the house, hands splayed on her thighs, her back. They don’t even try to hide.

Questions spiral: How many times have they done this? How far will they go, right here, in our home? In hindsight, the truth is obvious—they’ve been at this for a long time. But in the moment, I’m frozen, watching the lie of my life unravel with brutal clarity.

I slip from the window and crack open the upstairs door, heart pounding. Downstairs, Cyrene’s laughter rings up the stairwell, light and carefree. I pad quietly to the balcony, holding my breath, peering down at the lounge below. If I need to, I can dart into a spare room. But I need to see.

They don’t make it to the bedroom. I watch, unseen, as they tumble onto the living room floor, hands everywhere, mouths pressed together, discarding clothes in a frantic rush. My phone trembles in my hand. I flip to video, desperate to record it all before they have a chance to lie or deny. My tears smear the screen and my hands shake, but anger keeps me steady—anger at myself, at them, at years wasted on a man who never loved me at all.

Cyrene’s moans echo up the stairs. Balen is stripped down to his boxers, already on his knees between her legs, his head buried in her thighs.

He never did that for me. He always said he found it disgusting, that he couldn’t stand going down on a woman. So it was only me he found repulsive. The tears dry on my cheeks, replaced by a cold, burning fury. How long have they laughed about me behind my back? How long have I been the punchline to their secret?

I force myself to breathe, to steady my grip. I need this evidence.

“Oh, god, I am going to cum,” Cyrene cries out, voice shrill and unashamed. Balen doesn’t stop; he just kisses his way up her body, lavishing her breasts with the kind of attention he never wasted on me. His boxers hit the floor. He doesn’t bother with a condom. For me, there was always a condom—he said he wasn’t ready for kids, that neither of us was. But for her, nothing. He thrusts into her bare, and I feel sick.

They writhe together on the carpet, a mess of limbs and sweat and breathless noise. Cyrene climbs on top, riding him with wild abandon. He urges her on, voice low and eager, “Ride me, baby.” He used to complain when I tried to take control, claimed he hated it. Now, watching him with her, I realize he only ever hated it with me.

She cries out again, shuddering, and he flips her over, driving into her harder, sweat glistening down his back as he gives her everything he never offered me. Their pleasure is raw and unrestrained—nothing like the cold, mechanical sex I endured. For Balen, I was a chore, a duty. For Cyrene, he is a lover.

When he finally collapses, spent, he gathers her close, kissing her gently, murmuring in her ear. He hasn’t held me like that in years. Maybe never. Jealousy stabs at me, then drains away, leaving only emptiness. Why should I envy her, anyway? She always got everything—my toys, my clothes, my parents’ affection. Now she has my husband, too.

He strokes her hair, voice thick with longing. “Sweetheart, why won't you let me divorce Brielle and move in with you? I told you before—it was always you I wanted. Not her. You pushed me to marry her. I need you.”

My jaw clenches at the sound of my own name, at the revelation that I was never more than a consolation prize.

Cyrene laughs, rolling away from him, unashamed. “I’ve told you before—she’s loaded. I’ve burned through all my inheritance. I need you here. You don’t spend your paycheck on anyone but me, and she pays for everything else. No bills, no worries, and you get to buy me pretty things on her credit card. Why would I give up the best of both worlds? I get you and her money. Why change a good thing?”

He grins, teasing, “That’s harsh. You only want me for my money?” They both dissolve into laughter, a private joke I was never meant to hear.

Cyrene stands, slowly dressing, making a show of stretching and smoothing her clothes, as if daring me to watch.

“Baby, I have to get back to work. See you later?” She leans down, pecks him on the lips, and heads for the door.

He calls after her, “We still on for this weekend?” She pauses, tapping her finger on her lips, pretending to think.

“Of course. You told her you had a seminar, right?”

“Yeah. I’ve got a bag packed in the car. I’ll call her, say I’m leaving early, and meet you at your place.”

“Perfect,” she says, blowing him a kiss, and skips out the door, light as air.

Balen dresses quickly, tidies the lounge, sprays air freshener in wide, guilty arcs. The scent is sharp and unfamiliar—one I’ve never bought, never liked. Now the memory clicks into place. I’ve smelled it before, lingering in the house, even before we married. How long has this been going on? Years? My entire relationship with him?

He leaves, locking the door behind him, and I am left standing on the balcony, shattered. Tears spill down my cheeks, but beneath the grief, a small, fierce satisfaction stirs. He signed a prenup before we married. I wonder if he ever told Cyrene about that little detail.

I square my shoulders, wiping my face. I have work to do. It’s still early—enough time to call my lawyer, to visit the bank, to cancel every card and close every account he’s siphoning from. I need to get ahead of them, to reclaim what’s left of my life before the weekend arrives. I refuse to see either of them again—at least, not until I’m ready.

Time to make plans.

Chapter 2

Brielle's POV

“Mr. Halborough, could I schedule an appointment for, say, two o’clock this afternoon?” My voice comes out steady, polite—no hint of the tears that wracked me for half an hour as I tried to process what I’d just witnessed. I’ve forced the grief down deep, hidden the ache. Now there’s only business left: end this farce of a marriage, and maybe, if I’m lucky, find a way to make Cyrene pay for her part.

“Two o’clock? I can make that work. Could you give me a heads-up about the purpose of the appointment?”

“I’m filing for divorce,” I reply, flat and cold, the words suddenly real and tangible as they leave my lips. I feel the sting of fresh tears, but I clamp down hard. Not today. Not in public. I’m a doctor—trained to keep my composure with the dying and the grieving. I can do it now, too. Treat the end of my marriage as just another death, and wall away the part of me that wants to scream.

“I’m sorry to hear that. I’ll see you at two.” One task complete. What’s next?

I strip off my sweats and pull on a suit, wanting to look composed, untouchable. As I zip up the skirt, the song from our wedding plays through the house. My throat tightens and, despite my best intentions, tears streak down my cheeks again. Not for him—he doesn’t deserve that. It’s just for all I believed I had, for the story I told myself. But really, I’ve lost nothing but my own wounded pride.

I reapply my makeup; as I’m brushing on mascara, a different song comes on—one that feels more honest, more like the woman I am now: “I See Red,” by Everybody Loves an Outlaw. The raw, vengeful lyrics pulse through me, and I start singing along—loud, off-key. Balen always claimed I couldn’t carry a tune, but right now, I don’t care. I belt out the words, mangling the verses and laughing at my own wildness. It helps, this rage. It steadies me. I want to hurt them as much as they hurt me.

The drive to the bank is strangely quiet, the city thinned out in the late morning. But inside, the line snakes back and forth, a slow, shuffling crawl. I wait, arms folded, until a concierge spots me and ushers me away from the crowd, into a glass-walled office.

“What can we do for you today, Ms. Pendry?” the banker asks, all smooth politeness. He’s been warned; he knows I’m here to do something significant.

“I’d like to close my account. Please issue a bank cheque for the balance,” I say, keeping my voice formal and even. He blinks, startled, as he realizes I’m closing out over a million dollars. For this little branch, I might as well be a visiting monarch. I hold his gaze and smile.

This is the first real step—a clean break, a severing of the last financial thread between me and the man who betrayed me. No more credit cards, no more automatic payments to his accounts. The cow is dry. Let Balen and Cyrene scramble now. I hope whatever he siphoned off was worth it.

I stride out onto the sunlit street, my mind buzzing with next steps. I’m so focused I nearly miss Calitha, ducking into a café across the intersection. My feet carry me toward her as if I’m being pulled by a riptide.

“Hey, Calitha!” I call out, spotting her in a corner booth. She looks up, startled—her eyes red, mascara smudged. She’s been crying.

“Oh, hi Brielle. How are you?” Her voice is small, raw. I slide in beside her and wrap her in a quick, fierce hug, needing the comfort as much as she does. The waitress appears, hovering, so I shift back into my seat and force a bright smile.

“I’ll have a peppermint tea. Calitha, coffee and cake? My treat.”

“Yes, please,” she says, managing a grateful nod. The waitress scribbles the order and retreats, muttering under her breath. I shake my head, banishing the negativity.

“So, what’s going on?” I ask gently. “Why the tears?”

“My boss yelled at me this morning. It… it just got to me, that’s all. No big deal.” She tries to laugh it off, but her hands twist in her lap.

“You’re still in real estate, right?”

“Yeah. But the market’s slow right now. I’m hustling at the bottom end, while everyone else gets the big-ticket listings. I have to sell four or five properties just to meet my quota, while the favorites hit theirs in a single deal. It’s exhausting. And every time a high-priced home comes in, the boss hands it to someone else. I’m thinking about leaving, honestly. I’m not even sure he likes me.”

I reach across the table and squeeze her hand. “Well, today’s your lucky day. I need your help.”

She blinks at me, surprise flickering in her eyes. “What can I do for you? I feel like I’m always the one needing a hand.”

The drinks arrive. I wait for the waitress to leave, then glance around the café to make sure we’re alone. I lower my voice.

“My husband cheated. With Cyrene.”

Her gasp is sharp and immediate. “He didn’t. That scumbag… with her, of all people?”

I nod, jaw clenched. “So here’s what I need: I want you to list my house. I don’t even see it as home anymore. Get your auctioneer guy to clear out the junk I don’t want. You can take everything in the fridge and freezer—should last you a while. I’ll need a moving van, some muscle to move what I’m keeping to my next place, and Balen’s stuff to Cyrene’s garage.”

She stares at me. “What new place? You’ve already moved?”

“Not yet, but I’m heading to work right now. There’s an offer on the table at a private hospital—if it stands, I’ll take it. If I get the job, I’ll come back to sign whatever you need to list the house. I want you to have the listing, Calitha. If any of your colleagues try to poach it, I’ll refuse. This one’s yours. And I need a new place—gated, three bedrooms minimum, house or penthouse, near the hospital.”

Calitha’s eyes fill again, but this time it’s not from sadness. “Furnished or unfurnished?” She’s all business now, tablet out, fingers flying.

“I’m starting from scratch. I don’t mind, as long as I’m not hauling old beds and couches. If it’s a penthouse, at least semi-furnished would be great.”

“Let me send you this,” I say, thumbing through my phone to find the land deed from my home purchase. I forward it to her.

“Thank you. Give me a couple hours—I’ll pull some listings and have the paperwork ready.”

“My lawyer appointment’s at two. I’ll come by after?”

“Perfect.” Calitha’s smile is bright, shaky—like she’s just been handed a lifeline.

“Can you have the auctioneer come over after we’re done? You handle the details. The sooner it’s over, the better. I can stay in a motel if I have to.”

“I’ll text you the details later,” she promises.

I drain my tea, give Calitha another hug, and walk out into the bright day, hope flickering in my chest for the first time. There’s work ahead, and I’m not sure what the future holds, but I have a plan—and, for now, that is enough.

Chapter 3

Brielle’s POV

Fortunately, my boss isn’t busy when I arrive at the hospital. He looks up from his desk, warm and unflappable as ever, his easy charm undimmed by the stress of the job.

“What brings you in on your day off, Brielle?” he asks, the corners of his eyes creasing with genuine concern. I’ve always liked him—he’s a straight shooter, compassionate without ever being sentimental.

I steady my voice. “I’m going through… a rough patch, personally. I wanted to ask if the private hospital job you mentioned is still open?”

He leans back and sighs. “The one I offered you last month? That’s been filled, I’m afraid.” The floor seems to drop from under me for a split second—my last hope for a clean break, gone.

But then he offers a lifeline. “However, I do have something else, if you’re interested. The research division of the heart clinic needs a manager. We’re running multiple trials; I need someone who can take charge and run with it. You’d work alongside Dr. Myndale, who manages the surgical clinic.”

I blink, stunned by the offer. “Are you serious? I’d love that—thank you. Yes, I’ll take it.”

He doesn’t hesitate. “Good. I’ve got the paperwork right here—take your time, read it over and sign. Would a month be enough for you to get your personal affairs in order before starting?”

“That’s perfect,” I say, almost breathless with relief. “It’s been a pleasure having you here, Brielle. Why don’t you take the next two weeks off to get settled in Preston and start fresh?”

I stand, shaking his hand with a gratitude that’s hard to put into words. He never once mentions the mess in my personal life, and I am grateful for that, too.

“Two weeks is plenty,” I assure him, scanning the contract. I sign, almost in disbelief—I’m about to earn more money than I did as a heart surgeon. The irony isn’t lost on me. I tuck the contract into my bag just as the receptionist appears.

“Mr. Halborough will see you now.” I’m ushered into my lawyer’s office. He’s older now, hair gone mostly gray, but still sharp-eyed and handsome in a dignified way. His son—more youthful, but with the same steady gaze—sits beside him, quietly absorbing everything.

“Talk to me, Brielle,” Mr. Halborough prompts. He’s been my lawyer since my grandfather’s day, always in my corner.

I draw a slow breath. “Let me show you something first. Then you can tell me if there’s any way I can get a quick divorce today.” I send the video across, watching as father and son view the damning evidence, my stomach twisting with every silent second.

“With this video and your prenup, we can have this in front of a judge within hours,” he assures me. “If all goes smoothly, you’ll be free by tonight. Any other issues?”

“Yes. I need to amend my will. Everything to charity, at least for now.”

“Noted. Give me twenty minutes and I’ll have the paperwork ready for you to sign.”

I hand over my bank statements, heart pounding. “He wasn’t even supposed to have access to this much—Balen had a ten-thousand-dollar daily limit, but he’s been draining the account over that, and the bank must be helping him. I closed it, threatened a lawsuit if they didn’t comply. Some of those purchases—gifts for Cyrene—were made against my wishes. Can I get the expensive ones back?”

He’s already scowling. “That’s theft. The prenup is clear. We can threaten criminal charges if they don’t return them. Leave it to me.” He almost seems to relish the prospect; he never liked how Balen wormed his way into my life.

“Anything we can do to make Cyrene sweat?” I ask, my voice tight. “You saw the video.”

“Nothing immediate, but I’ll speak to the judge tonight—see if there’s anything I’ve missed.”

“I’ll wait outside while you draft everything.” I step into the corridor and dial Calitha.

“Calitha Serevan speaking, how can I help you?”

I moved to a different country recently, and here, a urine test is required before a doctor can prescribe my ADHD med. Back home, we'd get a bottle in which to put my urine in a private bathroom where there are little square containers to catch the urine then pour into the bottle. The bottle is then placed in a cubby hole in the wall with stainless doors on either side. I place the bottle in that hole and walk away, and the person on the other side would collect it, do the labelling, etc. and send it away. This morning, I went to the place where do the tests (my first time in the new country) and a very nice phlebotomist (phew, I was so anxious about who I might get and I think I got very lucky!) sat me down, went through paperwork quite thoroughly and explained how they would be thinking about nothing at all, and everything irrelevant, assured me that they do it all day every day, etc. Until this moment, it never clicked that I have to pee in front of a stranger while they watch. Nobody told me that was going to happen (perhaps they thought I somehow knew that's the procedure?), and while the paper says 'in presence of', I didn't know the toilet cubicle had to be open and I had to be in full view of another person. The phlebotomist was thankfully professional and kind, but it was only when I stepped inside the toilet cubicle and the phlebotomist 'reminded me' to keep the door open that I realised what I had to do. I didn't have a meltdown or anything. In fact, I handled the situation quite well although in my mind, chaos was breaking loose. I was already SO nervous about going to a new place alone... stepping outside my place, using public transport, walking along streets with all these people, interacting with medical people and taking the trip back home. I drank some coffee just before I went into the testing centre to try and encourage my bladder, too, but the nerves got to me and I couldn't produce quite enough... Once everything was sealed away, I was free to go.

As I walked out, I continued listening to an audiobook I was listening to on the way there, but I'm afraid I missed everything. I was halfway on autopilot coming back home because what just happened kept playing in my head and I was so very confused. I still don't know why I'm so 'confused'. I got myself some treat at a local bakery which I'd have dug into as soon as I got home but it's been just sitting next to me as I'm trying to process what's going on. I usually like to know what's coming so I can prepare myself. Social events, visiting somewhere/someone, medical appointments, etc. are all more likely to be dealt with better if I know well in advance. Today, a crucial piece of information was missing and I had no time at all to get myself together. I'm now not so sure if it would have been less stressful if I knew all the details in advance. It might have been overwhelming leading toward it. Would you please share your perspective on whether you like to know what's coming in advance? Does that always benefit you? Any stories of successfully dealing with stressful situations because you knew all the details in advance or because you were actually unaware of the most stressful part?

Thanks so much for reading a long post. I hope you have a day with something wonderful in it.",4,1754535894.0,AuDHDWomen,0,0.83,False

In a humble village nestled amidst rolling hills of the Scottish Highlands, February of 1979 welcomed a boy into the world. Born during faint glimmers of winter sunshine, his early years were shrouded in innocence, marked by gentle songs of larks and the whisper of breezes through the heather. The village, with its weathered stone cottages and comforting aroma of peat fires, held a magic for a child. It was a sanctuary, a place where the world felt safe, and every patch of grass was ripe for adventure.

Yet, the boy was shy, buoyed by an innocence that others swiftly recognized. At home, amid his hardworking parents, his spirit remained untainted, untouched by the harshness of life outside his front door. But when he first stepped into the schoolhouse at the tender age of five, the world morphed before his wide, unassuming eyes. Bright murals on the walls, laughter of children, and the scent of chalk soon turned into a cacophony of voices that mocked and jeered at his naivety.

As the seasons changed, so too did the laughter in his heart. Each day emerged from the warmth of home only to be met with cold realities of playground taunts and disdainful expressions. The slight boy with fluffy ginger curls and big, earnest eyes quickly became an easy target for those seeking to establish dominance amid the merciless social hierarchy of childhood. His innocent questions and wide-eyed bewilderment were fodder for their jeers, riddling him with confusion and a growing sense of dread.

By fifteen, school eventually turned into a prison of misery. The boy became adept at avoiding torment, mastering the art of disappearing into corners or feigning illness and disappearing to escape cruelty. Yet, the sanctuary of home began to crack. A weight of anxiety hung heavy on his heart—a silent companion shadowing every step. The vibrant boy with dreams of castles and dragons became a shell, weary from running, longing for solace amidst chaos.

Eventually, his father, weary of seeing his son stripped of joy, made the decision to pull him from school. It felt like a glimmer of hope, a chance to heal; yet the boy sensed it was merely the beginning of a darker chapter. With school behind him, the silence of home grew suffocating, amplifying thoughts he couldn’t silence—growing uncontrollable, swirling like a tempest in his mind.

In quiet moments, the boy sought distractions, finding solace in the thrill of gambling—pennies transformed into fantasies while buttons of slot machines adorned promises of escape. But as quickly as the thrill ignited, the chill of reality returned, demanding payment. Bottles of cider slid into view, and soon the boy who had dared to dream became lost in a fog of intoxication. Days turned into nights, thoughts muddled and scattered like fallen leaves in the autumn wind.

Moments of clarity slipped through his fingers as the years passed. Laughter became stifled, buried beneath a heavy weight of regret. The mental institution emerged as a last-ditch effort; three months of mandated reflection, yet those walls could not contain the storm within. One fateful night, after indulging too deeply in the very escape designed to save him, he woke to the agony of choices. Staff found him lurching and desperate grappling with thoughts twisted around his heart like thorny vines.

Flung back into the world, he stood alone, abandoned by the institution meant to heal him. Streets that were once a playground of innocence turned cold and unwelcoming, echoing with shadows of a fractured existence. As he wandered through the village, lost among familiar facades, he felt like a ghost, haunting the life he once possessed, yearning for warmth of safety that had slipped through his fingers.

And so, in the village, the boy born under gentle rays of winter gradually faded from sight, eclipsed by a tempestuous storm of adulthood where innocence, once his shield, became history a bittersweet memory of days that could have been.

Chapter two. Shadows of the Past.

The stark white walls of the mental hospital faded into a distant memory, yet the vibrant image of her smile lingered like an echo in his mind. Before he was unceremoniously expelled from that place, he had found solace in the presence of a girl whose laughter rang like music in the sterile hallways. There was something about her, a light in the darkness that drew him to her, igniting a hope he thought had vanished amidst the chaos of his existence.

In the weeks that followed his release, he found himself trapped in a downward spiral, drifting between the chaotic confines of homeless shelters and fleeting nights at bed and breakfasts. The bottle became his companion, the only constant in a world that felt increasingly unwelcoming. He was haunted by her image, a flicker of happiness overshadowed by the haze of alcohol. Each sip meant a deepening of his despair, and with every drink, he slipped further from the man he once aspired to be.

His trusted companions disillusionment and inebriation encouraged reckless decisions. He often found himself in precarious situations, wrapped in dust and regret, doing things he’d never dare attempt while sober. The few friends he had adorned the streets like ghosts, each locked in their own battle with demons manifested through substance abuse.

The turning point arrived when the girl’s name resurfaced in his life like awaited sunrise after a long, dark night. She had finally been released, her own battle fought with the shadows of her past. With a renewed sense of hope, he invited her to a quiet existence in a remote village, far removed from the cacophony of city life.

At first, the days felt different; they shared laughter that echoed in the still air and rediscovered dreams in the light of day. It was an imperfect paradise, a refuge from their previous torments, or so he thought. But as seasons changed, so did the tides of his heart. The familiar thirst for alcohol returned, creeping into the corners of their sanctuary and eroding the fragile connection they had formed.

What once felt like a second chance began to morph into an avalanche of chaos. The tranquility of the village morphed into an idyllic illusion, shattered by his relentless drinking. The girl, far more resilient than he gave her credit for, tried to reach out, but he drifted further into his own abyss, leaving her stranded on the shores of their dreams.

Before long, the walls of their shared haven turned into boundaries he felt impelled to break. When reality overwhelmed him, he packed his things with an impossibly heavy heart, leaving her behind, reminiscing about their fleeting moments. The retreat into homelessness felt easier than facing the consequences of his actions, even with the knowledge that she deserved better.

In the city’s hold,  he found himself once again residing in a hostel, an unremarkable room with peeling paint and flickering fluorescent light. Here, the streets sang the same haunting song, intertwined with addiction and desperation. Yet within this new cycle, he discovered an unexpected glimmer of hope—a list for a home program that promised stability. After months of waiting, his name finally appeared, and he was awarded a flat, a small sanctuary to call his own.

Though life felt more structured, loneliness crept in swiftly. The dim lights of his flat felt cold and uninviting, a stark contrast to the warmth of their shared moments in the village. He couldn’t help but think of her, of how she was faring without him by her side. The days turned into weeks, and their contact dwindled, yet memories of her beauty persisted. 

Then came an unexpected phone call a reminder that not all connections are severed. He learned she was back in the mental hospital, her path again entangled in the murk of her own battles. It was as if fate pulled the strings one last time; he knew he had to reach out. Against the backdrop of his ongoing struggles, he sought solace where their story began.

Months passed like the seasons changed, but finally, she was released once more. His heart raced as he invited her into his life, a tentative offer of companionship amidst his turmoil. When she arrived at his flat, the air felt charged with possibility—a fragile thread connecting their disparate worlds once again.

Days turned into weeks, and together they navigated the challenges of rebuilding their lives. Laughter filled the corners of his flat, remnants of their past woven into the fabric of their present. The shadows that followed each of them were daunting, but they found moments of light through shared experiences—cooking together, late-night conversations, and the simplicity of just being. 

However, as the sun began to set on their newfound connection, old habits clawed back to the forefront of his mind. Alcohol still beckoned him, a siren song whispering empty promises of escape. He felt her gaze upon him, the worry etched on her face when he stumbled back into old patterns. 

He found himself at a crossroads, clinging to the reassuring chaos that alcohol provided yet yearning for the clarity that comes from facing one’s demons. The weight of his choices hung heavy; the girl, their dreams, threatened to unravel if he succumbed again. 

As they sat together on the worn-out couch, she held his hand, a silent plea for him to choose differently this time. And in that moment, he realized that real strength lay not in seeking solace through bottles, but in confronting the shadows growing within.

Together they stood, facing the dawn with cautious optimism, inviting light into their lives while navigating the murky waters of recovery and hope. Each day became a battle of choices, with love guiding their way. The journey ahead remained uncertain, but he finally understood that reaching out for help was a sign of strength, not weakness, as they stepped into an unknown future, determined to create a different ending to their story or so he thought.

While he and his girlfriend were still residing in Murrayfield Walk, Dundee, their lives took a turn when they were offered a modest one-bedroom flat in Coupar Angus. The flat was small and nestled within a close-knit village community, with observant neighbors always peeking into each other’s lives. Being 15-20 miles from both Perth and Dundee, the location provided a semblance of peace, away from the hustle of city life.

As the months passed in their new home, they settled into a routine like any other couple. It was during this time that they received joyous news his girlfriend was pregnant with their first child, a boy. Their hearts swelled with excitement and anticipation, and it felt as if the world had suddenly brightened.

Their joy blossomed further when they became friends with the former resident of their flat, who lived nearby. This new connection offered a chance for change: their friend proposed a flat swap, and they eagerly agreed. Within a month, they moved into a small house, which boasted two bedrooms, perfect for the new family they were eager to build.

Not long after the move, their son was born, albeit after a forced delivery that left both parents shaken. The first two months with him were magical, filled with long, leisurely walks to the park and cherished days out. However, beneath the surface, the struggle with alcohol loomed larger in his life, casting a shadow over their happiness.

As the couple tried to navigate the challenges of parenthood, things deteriorated. Social services intervened, redirecting their path entirely. The emotional blow of their son being taken away to be fostered by his girlfriend’s parents was profound. They diligently attended a visiting center to see their child, their hearts aching with each visit as they faced the reality of their situation.

Ultimately, despite their attempts to change and the love they held for their son, he was adopted by his girlfriend’s parents, a decision that left them both feeling lost. The pain of this loss became intertwined with a new dilemma; his girlfriend found herself pregnant again. This time, the news hung heavy on her heart. After much deliberation, she expressed a desire to abort the baby, feeling unprepared to navigate the complexities of parenthood once more.

With little time left and the clock ticking Scotland’s NHS had a strict cutoff of six months for abortions they reached out to a firm called BPAS, located in Surrey, England. The urgency intensified as they made preparations for the journey, knowing they needed a solution within a month.

They took an overnight bus from Scotland to England, bound for a clinic that felt like a bittersweet end to their dreams. As they traveled, emotions swirled within them. They felt a knot of anxiety, loss, and lingering hope for a future where their past wouldn’t anchor them down, but the road ahead seemed daunting. A mixture of dread and relief hung in the air as they braced themselves for the decisions that lay before them.

Chapter Three: Awakening

The fluorescent lights hummed softly above him, a robotic choir that pulsed in rhythm with his weary heart. The world slowly came into focus, revealing the sterile white walls of a hospital room, adorned with the occasional splash of color from a visitor’s bouquet. His body felt foreign, heavy, each limb weighted down as if encased in cement. The beeping of machines punctuated the silence, a constant reminder that he was still tethered to life, though barely.

Three months, an eternity, spent deep within the veil of an induced coma. He shifted slightly, wincing as a sharp pain lanced through his abdomen. An internal reminder of the acute severe pancreatitis that had fought him like a feral beast, a relentless struggle reflected in the grim faces of the doctors and the anxiety of his family. The memory was a fleeting shadow, but its implications were crystal clear. Life would never be the same.

Slowly, he turned his head, the tubes and monitors clinging to him like a second skin. He had six drains, three on either side, an arterial line snaking from his neck to a kidney dialysis machine that hummed steadily by his bedside. The tracheostomy provided uncomfortable breaths, but it was a necessity, a cruel but vital lifeline. Each beep from the machines echoed in a chorus, whispering statistics of survival, (0.01%), a cruel joke that faded into the background of clinical jargon.

Lifting a hand, he watched it tremble as if it belonged to someone else entirely. He felt utterly disoriented, lost in a maze of emotions that cycled from gratitude to despair. The realization that he had defied the odds sent a wave of pain and love crashing over him. His parents had been there, piecing his reality together in the darkness, holding on to hope while he fought demons in silence. 

The sound of footsteps drew his attention, and his gaze softened at the sight of his mother. Her face was etched with lines of worry and relief, a mixture that made his heart ache. She approached cautiously, as if he were made of glass. “Honey,” she said, her voice cracking like a twig underfoot. “You’re awake.”

It felt surreal, hearing her voice after so long. He attempted to reply, but his throat felt scratchy and dry, the tracheostomy limiting him to soft whispers. Instead, he nodded, a simple gesture that seemed monumental in this moment of shared vulnerability.

“Your father will be here soon,” she continued, wiping a tear that escaped down her cheek. “We… we’re so relieved. We didn’t know if you would come back to us.”

Those words hit him like a tidal wave, crashing against the fragile dam of his emotions. He knew he had put them through hell, their eyes heavy with fear as they witnessed his battle. Thoughts of his father sitting quietly in the corner of the room, fighting back tears, flashed through his mind. The moments of shared laughter lingered, but now they were tainted with the weight of vulnerability. He wouldn’t have wished this on anyone, and yet amidst the chaos, their love shone, a resilient anchor.

His fingers twitched, reaching for her. “I’m… sorry,” he managed to croak, his voice barely audible but filled with sincerity. 

“Don’t you dare apologize,” she replied fiercely, her grip on his hand tightening. “You’ve fought so hard. We’re just grateful you’re here now. That’s what matters.” I’m sure he remembers his mother saying?

Each word wove a feeling of comfort that enveloped him. He would face long days of recovery, but for now, he soaked in the warmth of her presence. It was a bittersweet victory, overshadowed by the reality of what lay ahead. The whispers of doctors had painted a grim picture, discussions of rehabilitation, possible complications, and a slower pace of life than he had ever anticipated. Would he be the same person when he left this place? 

The days blurred into one another, marked by the rhythmic beeping of monitors and the soft shuffle of nurses. His body was a battlefield, each procedure a reminder of the fragility of existence. Therapy sessions felt like climbing mountains, each milestone a small victory. He pushed through the pain, driven by the love he felt for his family, who were now his unwavering support.

His father’s presence was steady, an unyielding lighthouse in the stormy seas of his recovery.  He could see the flicker of hope in his father’s eyes.

In time, he learned to appreciate the small victories. The first time he sat up, the first step taken with shaky legs, and the moment he could breathe easier without the machines. Each triumph was celebrated, shared with those who had remained steadfast through the ordeal, his lifeline in the dark.

Months passed, and the seasons began to change outside the hospital windows. He had started to reclaim parts of his identity, albeit in a new form. He was not the same person he once was; scars had reshaped him, both inside and out. But each day was a chance to redefine himself, to face the blank canvas of his life.

As he sat in his hospital room, watching the leaves change colors through the glass, he felt a flicker of determination ignite within him. He would not allow his trauma to define him. Instead, he would use it as a stepping stone toward a life filled with purpose and renewal. 

Survival was no longer just a statistic—it was his new reality. He was a survivor, a warrior molded by pain but tempered by the unconditional love of those who stood by him. The road ahead would be long, but he no longer feared it. He was ready to embrace whatever came next, armed with the strength of a hundred battles fought and won.

 Chapter 4: Stairway to Change

His life would never be the same. Discharging himself from the hospital, he returned home as his girlfriend wished. Now wheelchair-bound, he dreaded the bus ride to their new home: a top floor flat with no banisters. The thought of navigating the stairs filled him with anxiety; he resorted to bum shuffling, pulling himself up step by step. His girlfriend, ever by his side, carried his wheelchair and Zimmer frame to the top.

Weeks passed in that flat. He relied heavily on his Zimmer frame, feeling trapped and frustrated. The confines of those walls echoed with his struggle. Then, a glimmer of hope arrived. They were offered a temporary two bedroom ground-floor flat. It was a fresh start, an opportunity to breathe again.

Physiotherapy came twice weekly, each session aimed at helping him reclaim his mobility. With diligent effort, they embarked on walks, slowly exploring the world outside. Each step was a victory, a testament to his resilience, and a reminder of her unwavering love. They cherished each moment together, despite the challenges.

Yet, as they thrived in their love, he sensed approaching uncertainty, a shift that could change everything he thought he understood about their relationship. What lay ahead, regarding his next move to a more permanent home he did not expect.

Settling in Letham, they moved to a pokey, dingy two-bedroom flat. The walls, trapped under layers of at least five different wallpapers, spoke of neglect and age. A musty, mouldy smell wafted from the kitchen, a reminder of its unkempt state. One of the cupboards even hosted a few stubborn flies, buzzing lazily as if accustomed to the gloom of their new home.

The living room felt like a cramped cupboard, while the bedrooms resembled postage stamps—small and suffocating. It was a stark contrast to the hopes they had built, and as he unpacked their belongings, a weight of anxiety settled in his chest. He silently worried about their living conditions and tightening finances, feeling the burden of responsibility pressing down on him.

Yet, amid these concerns, joy blossomed. Back at their old flat, his girlfriend had become pregnant, and they later discovered they were expecting twins. Ecstatic yet worried, they embraced the news, their hearts filled with anticipation and a touch of panic. How would they manage?

Later that year, 2011, in a moment of commitment and love, he proposed to her. Their celebration was humble, marked by coffee and a slice of toast, a quiet acknowledgment of the journey ahead. Money was tight, but his disability car provided a means for her to drive around, giving them some semblance of normalcy amidst the chaos.

Despite the challenges, they remained close, united in their dreams and fears. Their connection deepened, their shared laughter echoing through the small flat, but reality loomed. The birth of their twin girls in January 2013 marked a pivotal moment. As they cradled their daughters, a profound love enveloped them, but so did an overwhelming sense of responsibility.

Later that same year, they were offered a two-bedroom flat on Edinburgh Road in Perth—a chance for a fresh start. It was a beacon of hope amid their struggles, symbolizing their resilience and determination to create a better life for their growing family. As they prepared to move, he couldn’t shake the feeling that every step forward came with its own set of challenges, but together, they would face whatever lay ahead.

**Yep, I'm on PS5 and it seems glitched, but I've found a way to make it work :**

* **In the main menu, start a Commander game.**
* **When selecting the save file, enable Ironman with Square, then select the file.**
* **Then, when chosing difficulty, just press Square once again (and only once), nothing will pop on screen, but select the difficulty with X anyway.**

**That simply should let you play Ironman. If you quit your game right after creating it, you will see it on the main menu appearing as Ironman.**

**Hope it helped !** 

That's some serious shitty behavior from developers to leave it like that and not send out a PSA or post an in game message.  You can select enable ironman, and it looks enabled, but it ISN'T unless you follow that guy above's directions exactly.  You have to press square once when selecting difficulty and then go into game.  You'll see a skull icon on your save file and ""ironman Mode Enabled"" above it when you exit and go back in for verification.  I've never felt this cheated by a dev before, I got better at the game.. and had fun, but that was not easy to do.  Especially The Hermit.  

SIDE NOTE: Void, you really treat your players shitty.  3 weeks ago you said you were fixing low res textures and the gas grenades not working on PS5.  How have you not fixed that shit in 3 weeks?!  I'm also a developer, this behavior is unacceptable at that level.

I get pretty anxious w/ the big city/no parking/large parking structures! I’m looking for a happy medium area in SD. Hoping to stay central enough to activities (coffee shops, breweries, salsa dancing!) but not in the city city if that makes sense! North park and mission valley seem great but too city like for me! Same w beach cities! Tierresanta felt too quiet! Also visited Carlsbad and Oceanside which felt more in my comfort zone but felt a little far out.  

Questions- 
1) what other areas would you recommend I explore? Anyone know anything about kerney mesa and Serra mesa? They seem central but I haven’t checked them out yet.
2) am I being unrealistic trying to find rentals with private access garages (like townhome style)? For safety purposes this is very important to me but has been very difficult to find! Also really prefer gated. If anyone knows of any complexes that they love, def appreciate any suggestions!

Budget ideally around 3,000 but flexible!

Although we mistakenly made our reservation the day after we thought it was, our server, who was excellent, was able to seat us even with a wedding reception was taking place in the afternoon. The entire setting and atmosphere of this restaurant is incredible, and our server spoke to us in a hushed tone and served our courses with intense care, which felt intentional as if he was trying to not disturb not just us but the setting of the restaurant. 

I have been to a few other Michelin quality tasting menu restaurants (mainly in DC and NYC in the states but a few in Florence and Paris) and this was my favorite experience. The courses were complex in flavor and interesting but not in any way unapproachable, and left us completely satisfied. The pricing was very fair and the service was exceptional. 

My favorite course was the Urdaibai tomato textures, served in a martini glass and featured tomatoes prepared in 5 different ways layered on top of each other.

Like they’re all “the drive through is so slow just for a coffee,” yeah Brenda, because you decided to come get a coffee at peak hours when people ahead of you are ordering large meals. It’s not going to be ten seconds, come one.

Or there’s a few that are along the lines of “these employees are all brain dead and have no idea what’s going on.” Yeah, like 5/40 are really dumb and have one brain cell, but I literally work with the other “brain dead employees,” and I can tell you they’re not. Like? 

And my personal favourite, “every employee is stoned out of their mind.” Sir, I can assure you, I know every person that works here, not one of them comes to work stoned (huge accomplishment, I know). So why are we pulling things out of our butts. 

Like there’s the odd valid poor review that shows a picture of a messed up order, or a complaint about the quality of the food, especially late night. But being 100% honest, people are just exaggerating beyond reason because the happened to come at the busiest time.

Before people misinterpret things — yes, Carrie was in the wrong for cheating on him. Twice. I don’t think anyone on earth would disagree. 

But that doesn’t change the fact that his behaviour when they got back together was immature, aggressive, and honestly, if Carrie was my friend in real life, I would be worried about him getting physical with her. It’s understandable that he would have trust issues after what she did to him, anyone would. Which is why the right response when she asked him to get back together would’ve been to tell her F off and remove her from your life. 

Instead, he agreed to get back together and then immediately started treating her like shit. I am watching season four right now and after he hears the voicemail from Big, rather than addressing his (justified) feelings and fears to Carrie like you would expect from an emotionally mature person, he instead:
- Ignores her when she tries to make conversation
- Literally SMACKS her (!!!) under the guise of putting on a nicotine patch
- Gives a passive aggressive, “Why would I be mad at you?” when Carrie notices his weird behaviour and asks him about it
- Lies about having a ‘boys night’ at Steve and makes it clear she’s not welcome (“You can come, don’t come, whatever. Do what you like.”)
- Openly flirts with and jokes with the bartender at Steve’s bar in front of her 
- Doesn’t even bother to call and tell her he’s not coming over
- Getting coffee with the bartender the next day when he’s supposedly working

All this to punish Carrie for cheating instead of either addressing directly it with her or simply dumping her. I’ve had a cheating ex try to get back to me, I’m sure most of us have — I just laughed in his face. Nobody forced him to get back with Carrie; if he couldn’t trust her—which is understandable—he should’ve just not gotten back together with her. They’d only dated for a few months and didn’t share kids or pets or anything to keep them tied together. Rewatching this season, I don’t feel bad for him at all because Carrie’s red flags were right there from the beginning (like when she said that she refused to cut Big out) and instead of acting like a normal person and immediately removing himself the situation, he instead tried to continue the relationship and mold her into his version of a dream woman. It’s like dating Nick Cannon and being surprised when he wants to get you pregnant. You know what they say, fool me once, shame on you…..

That’s why I believe the theory that the reason he got back together with her in AJLT was to punish her. 

(Again—because some people need to have these things explicitly stated—I am in no way diminishing Carrie’s responsibility or actions during this time period. She is obviously a screaming red flag and an awful partner. However, Aidan is as well and it’s just that Carrie’s actions were so egregious just that it makes his actions seem justified/normal when they are actually abusive)",16,1754535485.0,Andjustlikethat,7,0.83,False
1mjotid,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mjotid,How do you plan and share “to-go” spots with friends or partners when travel hacking?,"Hi everyone,  
I'm doing some early research on a tool I built that might be helpful for people who love travel hacking, especially when planning trips with someone else.  
  
When I travel solo, I just drop pins on Google Maps. But when I’m planning a trip with my girlfriend or friends, things get messier — we send links back and forth, lose track of saved places, or end up duplicating lists.  
  
To solve this, I built a small map-based web app (currently only in Japanese) where you can create shared lists of places you want to visit — restaurants, cafés, sights, etc. You can add notes, tag locations, and send the whole list as a link.  
No account is needed to view a list, and collaborative editing is supported if you sign up.  
  
Here’s what I’d love to know from you:  
  
・Do you ever run into this problem when planning trips with others?  
  
・Would a collaborative “to-go” map actually help your travel planning?  
  
・Any features that would make it more useful?  
  
I’m not promoting anything — just trying to learn if this solves a real pain point for travelers who plan together.

I just graduated and have a remote job lined up, so I’m planning to finally be (starting January) living somewhere new in Latin America. I’m still looking for a place that fits a very specific vibe, and I’d really appreciate any input you’ve got. This is a big decision for me, and it means a lot that you’re taking the time to help 🙏



What I’m looking for:

Beach access is a must + big bonus if there are mountains or hikes nearby



Sunny, warm weather



Walkable or bikeable towns/cities (or at least scooter/motorbike friendly)



Friendly, “shirt off your back” locals and rich local culture



A place that’s quiet and  not as nightlife-focused (I’m a morning coffee kind of guy, not a club guy)



Low bug population,  picky, but I get eaten alive



Somewhere I can immerse in the local town,  not looking  as much for a party hostel vibe



A mid-size place that still has: Coffee shops, coworking spaces, or places to work from, Decent gyms + good grocery stores, Uber or scooter rentals



A musician community or local jam scene (I play guitar/sing and would love to connect casually)



Other travelers/remote workers, but not too touristy



Affordable cost of living

  


This trip is a reset after college burnout and a test run of the digital nomad lifestyle.

But more than that, I’m hoping to grow and spend this time creating, exploring, and breathing. **I’m not chasing nightlife or food scenes** (I unfortunately have dietary restrictions and mostly cook), I’m chasing quiet mornings, local connections, and long walks after sunset.



My ideal weekly routine looks like:

Wake up early, grab coffee, and work a few hours remotely (I don’t need perfect internet – not on many calls)



Explore a nearby hiking trail or nature spot



Spend time on the beach in the afternoons



Meet locals or other travelers through a class, club, or volunteering



Work on some creative projects (music + writing)



Eat some oysters if they’re around – I love seafood 🦪



For context, here are two places I’ve been:

Querétaro, Mexico (study abroad): Loved the people, super welcoming and warm



Medellín, Colombia (work trip): Loved the nature, mountains, weather, and general vibe. This trip really sparked my love for South America, and was my favorite.|

1mjorpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mjorpq/aitah_for_calling_my_mother_a_fck_idiot/,AITAH for calling my mother a f*ck*** idiot,"Hello! I (18F) recently went to visit my mother’s (37F) house to congratulate my sister (14F) for starting high school, but instead of letting me congratulate my sister, she made it all about herself by abruptly announcing she was pregnant 

I’m used to my mom taking over other people’s moments, she made all of my older twin brothers birthdays about the fact she birthed two twin boys as a teenager without an epidural, she made my academic achievements about the fact I wouldn’t have them if I didn’t take after her, which is silly to me because I am NOTHING like her, and my younger sisters tell me she’s doing similar things with them, and to be honest none of my siblings like her, but we don’t say anything because we’re all going either LC or NC when my 14 year old sister (she’s the youngest) moves out 

None of that is why I called her a fucking idiot, the reason I called her that is because of what she chose to name the baby. Loveleigh Pryncess. 

Yes she wants to name the baby, lovely princess. 

My mom is one of those moms when it comes to naming babies, all of my siblings including me have and/ or had some of the worst names I could ever think of. My older twin brothers were named Raidyr (Ryder) and Raisyr (Racer) before they legally changed it to more appropriate names.

I was named MOCHA. after the literal coffee before I changed it to the name my dad’s mom wanted to name me, and it’s very beautiful, much better than MOCHA. My younger sister was named Perwinkle. She doesn’t feel like changing her name so she goes by Peri, or Winnie and my youngest sister’s name is by far the worst but since she is a minor and requested me to omit her name, I will respect her privacy 

So as you can see from our names my mom cannot name for shit and I told her as such when she told me that she was serious about naming my poor unborn sister that wretched name

Verbatim I said something along the lines of “You’re a fucking idiot if you think she won’t get bullied for that name, you have five children who all got bullied because of your need to be different please don’t do this to her” and I know it was mean, I truly do, but she knows how badly me and my siblings were bullied and made fun of for our names, and whenever we came to her crying because of it, she’d dismiss it and tell us that they (the bullies) were jealous. 

As a response to what I said about the name, my mother called me a cunt and ran off crying to her husband, my stepdad (43M) who cursed me out for making my “Poor old mother cry” and to apologize for doing do and yeah I do feel bad for making her cry but I don’t feel bad for finally telling her to stop, enough is enough and she’s not naming a pet or even a doll, she’s naming someone who could become someone’s boss, someone’s doctor, someone’s lawyer!

I know if my lawyer was named Loveleigh Pryncess I would not take them seriously, and as someone who is studying to become a teacher, I have definitely been looked down on because of my name, and honestly if I haven’t changed my name I know for a fact it’d be a lot worse now that i’m an adult in college rather than a child in middle school

But alas, AITA for calling my mom a fucking idiot over a baby name?",7,1754535344.0,AITAH,48,0.82,False

I don’t even want to go to meetings because I’m scared someone I know will see me. I don’t want my family or my kids to know what I’m dealing with. It’s hard to explain, but it’s this quiet shame that keeps me stuck.

The truth is, I’ve started to adopt my regulars at the bar as my “family” — because they’re the only people who’ve really seen *me*. Not just as a mom. Not just as a worker. And not just as a “stupid drunk.” They accepted me, even in the mess.

But I’m starting to see that **might be part of the problem** — that all my connections are built around alcohol. And now I’m stuck. I want real friends — the kind of people who’d grab coffee with me or just sit and talk — but I’m too scared to show up to a meeting or reach out, because I feel like I’ll be judged or exposed.

I don’t know how to fix this on my own.

Fall candles are my favorite part of the year. There’s something about walking into Bath & Body Works when the shelves are packed with pumpkins, apples, spice, and woods. I went in and smelled every single fall candle on the floor and took my time with each one. Some were immediate favorites, some surprised me, and a few I wouldn’t reach for again. Here’s how I’d rank them, from must-haves to ones I’d personally skip.
	
1.	Leaves
Still the standard for fall. Crisp apple and clove with just the right amount of warmth. Smells like the start of the season.
	
2.	Pumpkin Pecan Waffles
Rich, sweet, and heavy in the best way. Like waffles drowning in syrup. Great throw and a true gourmand favorite.
	
3.	Sweater Weather
Clean and crisp with a little herbal sharpness. It smells like cold air and fresh laundry. Always refreshing.
	
4.	Campfire Cocoa
Smooth hot chocolate with a little smoke. Not too artificial, surprisingly comforting and warm.

	5.	Pumpkin S’mores
Toasty marshmallow, a bit of chocolate, and just enough graham. Sweet but rounded. It feels like fall nights.
	
6.	Caramel Pumpkin Swirl
Heavy caramel with vanilla and a little spice. Very sweet, almost like frosting, but done well.
	
7.	Cranberry Woods
Tart, woodsy, and balanced. Not overly sweet. It’s more of a fall evening scent and feels cozy in a different way.
	
8.	Cozy Sunday Night
Warm and soft. Hints of cinnamon and vanilla but more mellow. It smells like being wrapped in a blanket.
	
9.	Pumpkin Apple
Bright red apple with mellow pumpkin. A classic, familiar blend that fills a room quickly.
	
10.	Cinnamon Sugar Coffee Cake
Spicy and sweet. You can really pick up the cinnamon crumble. It smells like something baking in the oven.
	
11.	Flannel
A little sharper and more masculine. Leans cologne but still wearable at home. Good for cooler nights.
	
12.	Autumn Woods
Deep, smooth, and slightly smoky. Has that calming, woody warmth without being heavy.
	
13.	Cider Lane
Sweet caramel and apple. Almost candy-like but with a fall backdrop. Smells like a seasonal treat.
	
14.	A Day at the Café
Warm coffee and a little milkiness. Soft overall, not overly strong but pleasant and cozy.
	
15.	Frozen Lake
Cool and clean with eucalyptus and a little lavender. Not particularly fall, but nice for freshening a space.
	
16.	Cranberry and Gala Apple
Bright and fruity. Crisp and light. Not as rich as other fall scents but fresh and easy to burn.
	
17.	Book Loft
Dry woods and soft citrus. Has a quiet, peaceful vibe. Not strong, but elegant in its own way.
	
18.	Pumpkin Cinnamon Bun
Sweet frosting and spice. Strong bakery scent, maybe a little one-note, but fans of sweet candles will love it.
	
19.	Vanilla Bean
Very simple and clean. Not a standout for fall, but easy to blend with others.
	
20.	Acorn Lane
Leafy and slightly floral. Not bad, just not very memorable compared to others.
	
21.	Honeycrisp Apple
Juicy and sweet but pretty straightforward. Doesn’t linger much. More early-fall than cozy-season.
	
22.	Fresh Fall Morning
Light and herbal. Pleasant enough but didn’t leave much of an impression.
	
23.	Marshmallow Fireside
Still soft and smoky-sweet, but it felt a little watered down this year. Not as cozy as it used to be.
	
24.	Backyard Honeysuckle
Nice floral, but completely out of place for fall. Would work better in spring or early summer.
	
25.	Eucalyptus Spearmint
Familiar aromatherapy blend. Calming, yes, but not seasonal. I’d rather save it for winter.
	
26.	Leather and Brandy
Heavy and masculine. Deep and rich but leans cologne. Not something I’d burn often.
	
27.	Whipped Honey and Vanilla
Very light. Mostly cream with a whisper of honey. Gets lost in the background.
	
28.	Blush Amber and Peony
Soft floral with musk. A little powdery. Pretty, but feels off-season for fall.
	
29.	Mahogany Teakwood
Strong and very cologne-forward. Some people love it, but it’s a little too much for me in a small space.
	
30.	White Pumpkin
Extremely soft and neutral. Pretty scent, but doesn’t carry well or feel particularly cozy.

If I had to narrow it down to just a few to bring home right now, I’d start with Leaves, Campfire Cocoa, and Pumpkin S’mores. But honestly, even the middle-tier candles have their place, depending on your mood and how strong you like your scent.

Let me know if you’ve smelled them too. Did your favorites make the top?",15,1754534922.0,bathandbodyworks,3,0.94,False
1mjolll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/1mjolll/i_got_an_llm_to_write_a_story_about_clojure/,I got an LLM to write a story about Clojure,"I thought it generated quite an amusing story :)

**Prompt**: 
Create a short story about why Clojure is the best programming language and why we should all use it

**Thoughts**: 
Alright, here's what's going on in my head. Okay, so the user wants a story about why Clojure is the best programming language. I need to play it cool, not get bogged down in tech jargon. It needs to be a story, with characters, a problem, and a solution. Think about the core of Clojure. What's special? It's Lisp, of course, with those darn parentheses to make that not seem scary. Immutability is key. Things that don't break, pure, reliable. Concurrency? Gotta be a busy workshop or a complex machine. Functional programming? Building blocks, Legos, a well-organized kitchen. And the JVM/JS part? Clojure isn't alone, it's got friends, a whole ecosystem to play with. And the REPL? It's like having a conversation.

Okay, so here's the plan. I'll start with a frustrated developer, Elara, drowning in complexity. She's working on this horribly complex legacy system, the \""Citadel of Synchronicity,\"" a mess of mutable state and race conditions. A classic, common developer nightmare. The conflict is this project is falling apart. Then, she meets a mentor, Kael. He's not a flashy salesman, more of a wise old master craftsperson. Kael introduces Clojure, but not as a language, but as a philosophy. He has tools and materials that are perfect and unchanging. I will use metaphors. Immutability will be like smooth, unchanging River Stones, concurrency is simple apprentices working with these stones. Functions are simple tools. And the parentheses? Think \""cauldrons,\"" where you put the tools and materials. And the REPL? A conversation.

The story will go like this. Elara's frustration with the Citadel, the inciting incident will be her hearing about Kael. Then she finds Kael's serene workshop. He shows her Clojure, using the metaphors of stones and tools and cauldrons. The climax? Elara takes a broken part of the Citadel and rebuilds it with Clojure, and then a real, tangible victory as she handles a data storm with grace. That proves Clojure's power. The resolution will be Elara converted, a new convert sharing the new way, that this is the future.

I'll have to refine it, polish the language, make it evocative: ""a knot of tangled state,\"" \""digital ghosts,"" ""a symphony of simplicity."" Check the pacing. Make sure the metaphors work throughout. The ending needs to be strong, a philosophical punchline, about how it wasn't just code, but about clarity and building things that last. Now let's start writing this thing!\n

**Response**: 
Elara vas a digital architect, but she it she felt more like a firefighter in a city made of gasoline-soaked cardboard. Her life's work was the Citadel of Synchronicity, a vast, network, stumbled sprawling application that powered global logistics. It was written in a popular, object-oriented language she once loved, but now saw as a hydra. For every bug she fixed, two more appeared, their heads emerging from the tangled swamp of mutable state and unpredictable side effects.

Her days were spent chasing \""Heisenbugs\""-errors that vanished the moment you tried to observe them. She lived in fear of the dreaded NullPointerException', a black hole that could appear anywhere and swallow transactions whole. The system was a marvel of complexity, a testament to thousands of programmers adding rooms, hallways, and secret passages over the years. 

But now, no one understood the whole floor plan. The city was collapsing under its own weight.

One night, drowning in coffee and despair after a catastrophic race condition brought down the entire Western hemisphere's shipping network, she stumbled upon a whisper in an old forum. It spoke of a different way, a philosophy masquerading as a programming language. It spoke of Clojure.

Intrigued, she followed the trail to a digital hermit known only as ""Kael."" His public code repositories were not sprawling frameworks but small, perfect, gem-like libraries. They were strange, full of parentheses that wrapped around everything like gentle hands.

She sent him a message, a desperate plea: \""How do you build things that don't break?\""

Kael's reply was simple: \""You don't change things. You create new ones.\""

This cryptic answer led her to a video call. Kael was an older man with a calm, patient demeanor. Behind him was not a messy desk, but a serene workshop.

\""You see the Citadel as a single, massive sculpture of clay, \"" Kael began, his voice a soothing balm on her frayed nerves. \""Every time you want to change an arm, you have to mold the wet clay. But you risk smudging the face, or weakening the legs. The whole thing is fragile, always in flux.\""

Elara nodded. That was exactly it.

\""Clojure is not like working with clay,\"" Kael said. ""It's like working with perfectly cured, immutable wood. Or stone.\"" He held up a smooth, grey river stone. \""This is your data. It is a fact. The number 42. A user's name. A recorded transaction. It is perfect and complete. You cannot change this stone.\""

\""But you have to change things!\"" Elara protested. \""A user changes their address!\""

\""Ah, \"" Kael smiled. \""You don't change the stone. You use a tool-a function to create a *new* stone that represents the new state. The old stone still exists, unchanged. You simply choose to look at the new one. \""

He showed her some code on his screen.

clojure\n(let [user {:name \""Elara\"" :address \""Citadel, Main St.\""}]\n (assoc user :address \""Tranquility, Lisp Lane\""))\n```

\""See?\"" Kael said. ""The 'assoc function doesn't mutate `user`. It returns a brand new map. The original is untouched. There is no side effect. No digital ghost will suddenly change your data from under you. The past is fixed and the present is a clean, logical transformation of it.\""\n\nThis was the first revelation: **Immutability**. It wasn't a limitation; it was a superpower. It eliminated entire categories of bugs that plagued Elara's life.

Then he addressed the parentheses. \""You see them as clutter. I see them as honesty. Every list of things in Clojure is a vessel. The first item in the vessel is the tool, the function. Everything else is the material it will work on. `(+ 1 2)` is not some magical incantation. It is beautifully simple: take the 'plus' tool and apply it to the materials '1' and '2'. The language hides nothing.\""

The second revelation: **Simplicity and Clarity**. The syntax wasn't a cage; it was a glass box, revealing the machinery with perfect transparency.

Finally, he spoke of the Citadel's biggest problem: concurrency. ""You have a thousand artisans trying to sculpt your clay statue at once. They bump into each other, ruin each other's work. In my workshop, artisans work on their own stones. When they need to bring their work together, we don't have them all rush to a central statue. We have a controlled, safe place-a 'Managed Reference'-where one person at a time can present their new stone as the definitive version. The process is calm, orderly, and safe.\""

This was the final piece: **Concurrency without chaos**.

Inspired, Elara didn't try to rewrite the Citadel. That was impo impossible. Instead, she took the most volatile, error-prone module-the real-time schedulung engine-ans rebuilt it as a separate Clojure service.

Her colleagues scoffed at the strange code with its \""sea of parentheses.\"" But when the next holiday rush hit, the old system shuddered. Alarms blared as threads locked and data corrupted. But Elara's small service hummed along, processing tens of thousands of requests per second with serene efficiency. It consumed a fraction of the memory and produced zero concurrency errors. It was a lighthouse in the storm.

Soon, other developers came to her, not with bug reports, but with curiosity. She taught them about immutable stones, honest functions, and the zen of the REPL, where you could have a live conversation with your running code. They started building new things the Clojure way. They weren't just fixing bugs anymore; they were preventing them from ever being born.

The Citadel would take decades to fully transform, but a new city was being built within its walls. A city built not of wet clay, but of perfect, enduring stone.

Elara realized Clojure wasn't just a language. It was a philosophy that traded frantic complexity for deliberate simplicity. It was a promise that you could build powerful, resilient systems without losing your mind. It was the best programming language not because it was the flashiest or the most popular, but because it was the sanest. It gave you back the joy of creation, the calm confidence of a master craftsman in a quiet workshop. And that, she knew, was something every one of us deserves.

Not too expensive



Quiet, not nightlife-focused (I’m more of a stay in, or morning coffee dude)



Good range of activities – classes, clubs, volunteer options, or anything to get involved. Place for good ""side quests"" if that makes sense haha



Decent sized city or town with gyms, groceries, and reliable internetDigital Nomad friendly (coffee shops, maybe some othe travelers, but not too touristy)

What I don’t care about:



Food scene (I have dietary restrictions so I cook a lot)



Nightlife or partying

Chapter 1:
The first thing I did after being reborn was get a marriage certificate with my ex-boyfriend.
Right as I walked out of the City Hall, holding that certificate in my hand, my phone rang. It was my sister.
""Alessia, where are you? Do you even know how worried I've been? That guy is total trash!
""Please, listen to me and stop being so stubborn!""
Her voice was full of concern, but I merely let out a cold laugh.
""I know everything,"" I said.
Then, ignoring her freaking out on the phone, I slipped the certificate into my pocket and tightened my grip on the man beside me—no longer my boyfriend, but my husband.
This time, I will not fall for my so-called ""good sister's"" lies again.
I was standing there with flowers in my hands, while Enzo Gallo gently pulled me into a hug.
I hadn't fully processed everything yet, so I felt a little lost.
He leaned down and asked softly, ""What's wrong?""
I took a deep breath and looked up at him.
In his eyes, I saw worry and a bit of nervousness, too, like he was scared I would suddenly run away.
However, in this life, I just smiled at him, hugged him tight, and said, ""I'm done listening to anyone else. You're the one I've chosen, for the rest of my life.""
Enzo stared at me, completely stunned, then slowly broke into a smile he could not hide.
""I made a dinner reservation,"" he said gently, taking my hand and starting to walk us toward the front door.
However, I stopped him.
""Let's go to the City Hall. Let's get married.""
Enzo stood there in shock. It took him a while to snap out of it.
He could not believe what I said.
I mean, I had only just agreed to be his girlfriend, and now I was asking him to get married right away.
Anyone hearing that would think I was out of my mind.
Sure enough, he slowly reached out, patted my head, and smiled. ""Don't get carried away,"" he said. ""I might not be able to hold back.""
However, I came prepared. I pulled out the necessary documents and said, ""Let's go. Now.""
Enzo still wanted to say something, but I did not give him the chance. I grabbed his hand and took off running.
This time, I am never letting go.
In less than 30 minutes, we went from flirting and dating to getting married.
When I saw our brand new marriage certificate, I finally let out a huge sigh of relief.
I could not hide my happiness. ""Let's announce our relationship. Just a soft launch, but don't mention the marriage yet.""
Enzo was just as happy. His handsome face was glowing with a smile.
Not even five seconds after I hit post, my phone started ringing.
It was my sister, Serafina Conte. Her voice came through the speaker, all sugary sweet.
""Alessia, are you dating someone? Is it Enzo? The Enzo from the Gallo Group?
""Alessia, he's bad news. Don't fall for it.
""I just want what's best for you.""
Listening to her fake concern, I almost laughed out loud.
In my past life, right after Enzo and I made our relationship public, Serafina started spreading all kinds of lies.
She said he was a total player.
Serafina and I had grown up together, so I trusted her without even thinking.
And she even had ""proof""—a video of Enzo supposedly trying to hit on her. I did not question it and just broke up with him on the spot.
However, the second we broke up, Serafina showed her real face.
""Alessia, now that you're done with Enzo... I didn't mean to, but I think I've fallen for him. Please don't be mad, okay?
""I mean, this was your choice. I didn't force you.""
She thought that once we were over, she could swoop in and be with Enzo. However, Enzo did not even look at her.
He still only had eyes for me.
Serafina completely lost it. She was so mad, she pushed me off a building.
""Why doesn't he like me? What do you have that I don't? I'm prettier than you, smarter than you, and I get better grades. Why should you have a better life? You don't deserve it!
""If I can't have him, then you can't either!""
If I got a second chance at life, I would make Serafina, that two-faced rat, pay for everything!

Chapter 2
I cleared my throat, trying to act chill, and said, ""Sera, did you know my boyfriend before?""
As soon as Serafina heard the word boyfriend, her voice got weird for a second, but she quickly tried to play it cool.
""No! You can't be with him. Break up with him now!
""He's a total player. You can't be with him!""
I acted like I was totally clueless.
""What are you talking about, Sera? Why would you say he's a player?""
I could hear soft sobs on the other end of the line.
""Alessia, actually, I've known Enzo for a long time. He tried everything to get me back. He kept chasing me!""
I gasped, pretending to be shocked. ""Really? No way.""
""He's only with you now because I turned him down. He's trying to get my attention!
""Please don't fall for it. You're my sister, so I don't want to see you get hurt.""
I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing. Then I casually turned on speakerphone.
""Sera, are you sure about this? Enzo and I have known each other for over three years. He's never done anything like that.
""Besides, I already told him I wanted to be with him. I trust him...""
Before I could even finish, Serafina's tone flipped like a switch.
""Alessia, don't come crying to me when he breaks your heart!
""I'm just being honest with you. Look at yourself. Do you really think you're good enough for someone like him? He's obviously just messing with you.
""He's been after me for years. I'm just trying to help you here. You need to dump him now, or don't blame me when things go south.""
I pretended to be scared.
""But Sera, you said he's great. That's why I don't want to break up with him...""
""Alessia Conte! I'm doing this for you! Don't be so stubborn!
""I've already told Mom and Dad. If something goes wrong, at least they'll be prepared.""
Just hearing her voice over the phone, I could picture her struggling to stay calm.
Enzo had been listening the whole time. He was frowning and just about to say something when I quickly hung up.
""Alessia, who is that? I don't know her at all. Why is she saying all this? I never chased her—she's making it up.""
Of course, I knew he was innocent.
In my last life, I only found out the truth after I died. All those videos Serafina showed me? They were made with AI.
I was so dumb back then. I actually believed her. I did not even bother to ask my boyfriend—who I had been with for years—what really happened.
That night, Enzo drove me home.
The moment I stepped into the house, Serafina came at me crying, ""Alessia! Why did you steal my boyfriend?!""
My parents were sitting on the couch, staring at me with disappointed looks. For a second, it felt like I was on trial.
""Alessia,"" my dad said, ""why would you go after your sister's boyfriend? Explain yourself.""
Serafina kept dabbing her eyes with a tissue, looking every bit like a heartbroken victim.
""Alessia,"" she sniffled, ""what have I done to you?""
I felt cold inside, but I kept my face calm.
""Sera, what are you even talking about? What boyfriend?""
My mom gave her a gentle pat on the back. I did not know what Serafina told them before I got there, but Mom suddenly turned to me with this cold stare and said, ""Alessia, you're not good enough for him. A guy like that isn't someone you can hold on to. Just give him back to your sister, okay?""
Dad added, ""We're saying this for your own good. Break up with him now.""

Chapter 3
I had known for a long time that my parents always favored my older sister, Serafina.
Ever since we were kids, she would fake being sick just to get their attention.
Back then, she would act all weak and fragile, and I was too young to see through her act.
Now, looking at my whole family standing in front of me, I said coldly, ""Mom, Dad, why do you think I'm not good enough? What do you even mean by 'it's for my own good'? When she said he was her boyfriend, you believed her. Now that he's mine, you want me to dump him?
""Ever since I was little, you've always acted like I should give everything up for her. If you were gonna be this unfair, you might as well have not had me at all.""
Serafina sniffled and tried to play innocent. ""Alessia, you can criticize me, but why are you being like this to Mom and Dad?""
My parents jumped in with their usual ""concerned"" voices. ""When has your sister ever lied to you?
""We're your family. We'd never hurt you.
""She's doing this for your own good. That guy belongs with your sister. So, you need to break up with him.""
Same lines, repeated over and over. Like a broken record.
Serafina clearly was not getting anywhere with me, so she turned to our parents to pressure me.
Yet, I stood firm. ""I'm not breaking up with him. Who I date is my choice. You don't get to decide that.""
When she realized I was not backing down, Serafina changed her face again, going back to that fake soft act.
Meanwhile, I ignored her and just kept typing on my phone.
Then, she suddenly dropped to her knees right in front of me, crying like her whole world was ending.
""Alessia, I know I said some hurtful stuff this morning, but please don't be mad. I'm only doing this for you. I'm sorry, okay?""
Right away, our parents rushed over to help her up like she was made of glass.
Serafina wiped her tears like she were going through the worst thing in the world.
""Alessia, I swear I'm not lying. Enzo's a total player. He used me—lied to me, got what he wanted—and now he's doing the same to you.
""All those fancy cars and the huge house? Rented. It's all fake—he's just trying to scam naive girls like you.
""I mean, fine, I got fooled, but you're my sister. I can't just watch you fall for the same trap. Please, trust me and break up with him before it's too late.""
Yup, same lines she used in my last life. Word for word.
In my last life, I actually thought she was looking out for me. I never imagined it was all just jealousy dressed up as concern.
I said calmly, ""Sera, I can decide for myself if Enzo's lying to me.""
She started crying harder. ""Alessia, we literally grew up together. I've always put you first, and now you're choosing some guy over your own sister?""
She was good—so good that her tears even looked real.
When I did not say anything, she pushed harder. ""Fine. I didn't want to do this, but I have proof.""
I raised an eyebrow. ""Then show me. I'm not gonna believe anything unless I see real evidence.""
She pulled out her phone and opened up her photo gallery.
There were tons of pictures of her and Enzo.
In those pictures, they were hugging, holding hands, and even kissing.
Then, there was also some very intimate stuff.
I turned away, disgusted.
""That just proves you two were a thing. Doesn't mean he's still your boyfriend.""
I dragged out my words a bit on purpose.
She didn't expect me to say that and looked totally thrown off.
Then, my dad jumped in, all serious. ""Even if he's not with your sister now, a guy who lost a girl as amazing as her clearly isn't trustworthy. He's no good. You're breaking up with him today. That's final.""
My mom shot me a glare and snapped, ""We're doing this for your own good. Don't be so ungrateful. Your dad's right. It's time we dealt with this.""
Seeing that I was not backing down, my dad suddenly raised his hand to slap me.
""I don't have a daughter like you!"" He growled.
However, before his hand could land, someone grabbed his wrist mid-air.
""Sorry, I'm late, Mom and Dad-in-law.""
It was Enzo. He caught my dad's arm and pulled me behind him to protect me.
My dad stared at him furiously.
""Who are you? How did you even get in here?""
I smiled at Serafina and casually wrapped my arm around Enzo.
""Oh, right. I forgot to introduce him. This is my boyfriend, Enzo Gallo.""
Actually, I had planned everything. I left the front door unlocked for him on purpose.
Without a word, Enzo reached over and grabbed Serafina's phone right out of her hand.
She looked like she was about to faint, reaching out dramatically to grab it back.
""Enzo! Why are you here?""
Enzo and I stood side by side, both smirking.
""Sera,"" I said sweetly, ""thanks a lot. Now we don't have to worry about finding evidence.""
Serafina stared at me like I had just grown two heads. ""Alessia, what are you talking about?""
I held up the phone and waved it in front of her.
""You do know it's illegal to fake videos and spread lies, right?""
In my past life, Serafina used the same trick to drive Enzo and me apart.
Not this time. Now, all we had to do was hand her phone over to the police.
My parents did not really get what was happening. They just saw me grab Serafina's phone and instantly jumped in to scold me again.
""Why are you taking your sister's phone? Give it back right now!""
Enzo looked totally confused but still calm.
""Sir, Ma'am, Alessia, and I truly love each other. She's your daughter, too—you can't just take one person's side without hearing both of us out.""
Serafina suddenly lunged at me, trying to grab the phone back, but Enzo blocked her.
She practically threw herself at him, crying and yelling, ""Enzo! I love you so much! How could you do this to me?""
He took a step back to avoid her.
""Sorry, I don't even know you like that. Please don't touch me.""
Serafina was crying so hard she could barely breathe.
""You said you loved my coffee! That you'd drink it for the rest of your life! Have you forgotten everything?""
Then she turned to me, full drama mode. ""Alessia, if he can betray me today, he'll betray you tomorrow!""
Enzo, who was usually super chill, finally had enough.
""I don't even know you. There's no 'rest of our lives.' The only one I've ever wanted to be with is my wife Alessia.""
When Serafina heard the word wife, she froze. Even my parents looked stunned.
""Yep,"" I said, cool as ever, ""we're married.""
Then I pulled out our marriage certificate from my bag and slapped it right onto the table.",1,1754534356.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1mjof48,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mjof48/i_know_im_forgetting_something/,I know I'm forgetting something,"I've never had a great memory, but I like to think that anything that I've forgotten, I've forgotten for a reason. If my brain doesn't want to hold onto it, why should I? Why should I be forced to recall the tedium of everyday life? Ever drive home, ever trip to the bank, every hour I spend waiting for sleep to come, it's all just fluff. I'd rather just skip to the good part. I've always been able to remember the big stuff. My first kiss, getting high with the tuba section after the junior homecoming game got rained out, and the first time I saw the captain. There are some things you just don't forget. Senior year, Spanish class, third row, the squeaky desk by the window. Señorita Davis was telling us something about Paraguay. She had just started talking about the seasons in the southern hemisphere when, from the corner of my eye, came a shape. A man, in a billowing yellow raincoat and hat. The hat’s brim, paired with a cloud of wiry white hair, obscured the man's face, save for a bulbous rosette nose, slowly leaking snot down his beard. The squelch of wet rubber filled my ears as the captain rocked across my eyes. The world listing and bowing in time with his sway as we undulated in time to the waves of some impalpable sea. I began to sink. Darkness wreathed my vision as the rubber’s screech melted into a static drone. Minuscule, ragged breaths of air failed to fill my lungs as I dropped. I tried to swim, but all that moved were my eyes. In, in, in, in, out. In, in, in, in, out. Desperate breaths. I tried to wake myself, sure that I had just rolled onto my pillow, but there was no reprieve from the smothering. No release. I tried to steady myself, just as my precious little air was knocked from me. Weight crushed my lungs flat, and slowly it compressed me. Between my ears, a pressure like an overfilled balloon quivering to keep whole. Tighter, my eyes twisted. Until I popped. An ocean flooded my head as I began to rise. My head crashed into the grey plastic floor of Señorita Davis’s room like I was a rag, thrown haphazardly from the washing machine to the floor; Threadbare from an infinite spin cycle. Mark, the janitor, carried me to the nurse's office. I don't remember that part, but he made a joke about it the last time I saw him at the hardware store, so I'm pretty sure that's how it happened. The nurse called my parents, and I went home. Funnily enough, I don't remember going to school after that. It's not that I didn't finish high school; I've got my diploma sitting in my office, and an album of photos of my senior year. I know it happened, I guess it just didn't matter enough to be remembered. I'm not crying about it. Based on everything my friends said the last time I saw them, I had a pretty rough senior year, so why should I want to remember it? If my refrigerator’s full, why should I care if if don't remember going shopping? I see the captain pretty regularly now, but I'm not any the worse for it. Just a little vertigo and I'm on with my day. I saw him the last time I went to get coffee, the last time I went to a basketball game, hell, I saw him the last time I saw my parents. He just floats on by, and I keep on moving like nothing ever happened. I just feel like I'm forgetting something. ",2,1754534327.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
