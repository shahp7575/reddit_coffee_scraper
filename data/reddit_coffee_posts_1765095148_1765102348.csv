Always been a big drinker and party guy. But on Boxing Day 2024 I finally admitted to my family that my drinking had evolved into a very pokey problem, and I knew I wanted to sort it out 

I started off by going to AA meetings two days after that admission, as they’re obviously very widely known about method 

As someone who considers themselves spiritually curious / open to there being something out there but very much not into organised religion, I thought “OK, this is giving strong church vibes, but they keep saying it’s not religious / affiliated with any religion, so let’s go with it” 

Now, I attended AA for months and did not start the 12 steps / get a sponsor (thankfully I think) but pretty much all I took from it was people talking about how great AA / the 12 steps are, and to keep coming to more and more meetings etc etc  

I never heard anything practical about how to prevent cravings, deal with emotions etc. Just give everything about yourself over to AA and the people there and be a good boy because you’re morally done in 

Now looking back I see those overly friendly faces / repeated requests to meet them further / go to more coffee / get the materials etc as like the faces from Get Out or someone from Scientology trying to keep me in the system 

Luckily, I started working my recovery with a brilliant non-profit we have in the UK called Change Grow Live - who provide treatment services to local authorities - and who a medic relative recommended to me 

Through them, I accessed detox treatment, a support worker contact, medical supervision and prescribed medicine in combination with my doctor, and ultimately SMART sessions / CBT techniques which were massively eye opening 

SMAT groups felt different immediately different - non-judgemental, highly practical, science based, and didn’t fill me with shame or ask me to give my soul over to a system 

I stopped going to AA completely 

I apply the SMART techniques every day and they really helped me through the first few months and I keep up weekly with online groups here in the UK and in the US too where there feels like there’s genuine community and supportive people with practical advice, unlike with AA 

Those practical tools, as well as working with my doctors to analyses how my health has massively improved are tangible, science based, things that are keeping me going and feeling / looking great 

I’m glad to see others here feel the same! ",1,1765101825.0,recoverywithoutAA,0,1.0,False

My commute is only 6 miles and I bought a used scooter for $800. It’s been amazing during the summer. I saved a ton of money, felt good about reducing my carbon footprint, actually enjoyed my commute for once.

Now it’s late November and I’m starting to understand why everyone thought I was crazy. It’s not just rain anymore, it’s freezing rain. Some mornings there’s ice on my seat. My hands go numb even with winter gloves. I showed up to work yesterday shivering so hard I couldn't hold my coffee cup steady.

My coworkers have stopped making jokes and started expressing genuine concern. My boss asked if I was “doing okay financially” because apparently I look that miserable every morning. It’s embarrassing.

I’ve been researching alternatives because I really don’t want to go back to car ownership after making it this far. Found out there are these enclosed scooters with roofs that apparently exist in other countries. basically weather protection without needing a full car. Saw some on alibaba but they look rather expensive and I’m not even sure if they'd handle ice.

Part of me thinks I should just tough it out until spring. I’ve already made it seven months. The other part of me is freezing and miserable and wondering if this is actually sustainable long-term.

How do people maintain car-free life through actual winter? Is this just brutal for everyone or am I doing something wrong?",1,1765101723.0,carfree,0,1.0,False

She cried and she said to me “I don’t know why you have this impression of me”. This melted my heart I apologised and I said that I tend to be very jealous and emotional very often, a while after that we were good and she even asked me what I would like her to do is anything like this happens again, then I told her “nothing of course I’m not in the position to tell you who to speak and who to not, only tell me if someone’s bothering you”.

The date went well naman and he even booked me a grab ride pauwi kasi naulan, nagsabi kasi akong angkas lang sinakyan ko papunta. 

Ayun, kinilig naman ako and nag assume na baka ito na hahaha. Nung nasa bahay na ako, I updated him and he asked if we can connect on FB. Hahaha FB talaga? Btw he's 29 and I am 25. 

Ayun nagfriend request ako sa kanya, and syempre inistalk ko na. Napatangina nalang ako, yung timeline niya puro tatay digong and bring him home.

Early in the morning before I leave for my workplace, and in the evenings after dinner. I enjoy watching the skies and the scenery around me whilst strolling quietly. Losing weight is also an added advantage.

Quite recently, a few days ago even, my son started to go and enjoy the evening walks with me, and I loved it too. We have some extra father and son bonding time where he tells me all the stuff that happens at school. The problem, though, is that the little guy's just six years old. When we go on these walks, he ends up getting tired and I have to give him a piggy back ride to the house. I don't want to tell him to stop coming with me.

First, I considered going for a drive in the evening everyday, but then I'm going on walks for fitness reasons too, and what good would it be if I just drive? I decided to focus on finding a solution that would keep me losing weight and bonding with my son more.

I was shopping for a new coffee table on Alibaba this week when I saw a nice loplift bike, it looks different than a normal bike, something of a hybrid between a scooter and a bicycle.

I think it might be the perfect solution. What do you guys think? Has anyone had this kind of issue too? How did you handle it?",1,1765101181.0,Fatherhood,0,1.0,False

I started dating a guy recently (4 dates in) who I felt might be a DA, he was amazing fun, made loads of efforts on dating but it was like an on/off switch if we weren’t together. I messaged him telling him it would help me if we maintained a little more contact between dates to help me feel more connected to him and how did he feel about that?

Well I hit a trigger because he just didn’t respond. So two days later I ended it because I don’t need someone whose capacity is so low they can’t have a conversation. But it wasn’t a bad ending, absolutely no hard feelings. He told me he didn’t want a relationship with me either. 

A few weeks later I reached out to him for advice about some DIY I was doing and we ended up chatting and agreeing to meet for lunch. At lunch I told him about attachment theory and how he had clearly seen my message as pressure etc etc, surprisingly, he was open to everything I was saying. He admitted things I was telling him, he had had feedback on from previous people. It was a really positive conversation and we agreed to be friends. He told me he thought it would be hard to be friends as he was very attracted to me but he wanted to try and we both knew we were dating other people. 

Anyway, since then his communication has been 1000% more, I’ve even joked about it. We’ve met up now 4 times as friends, a couple of coffees and one night he made food for me and took me to a play he had booked. But everytime he has clearly wanted to make things physical. But I’ve been really clear on that boundary. We’ve gotten so much closer and I really enjoy his company. 

The last time we met, we ended up kissing and he tried to escalate it further and I refused. He seemed to take this quite hard, making comments like it really was a “dead end”. He was then saying he didn’t know if he could remain friends as it was too difficult for him. 

he was telling me things about how he really wanted a relationship and he had loads of girls knocking at his door but he was bored of casual sex and he needed someone on his level. 

He was saying about how he needed to go and meet someone but it was such “hard work”. He was telling me how nice it was to talk to me as I was on his level intellectually and he felt he could really talk to me about things as I really understood him.  

I asked him why he had previously decided that he doesn’t want a relationship with me (even though I never asked for one!) and he said that he just wasn’t feeling it in that moment that he said it, that I can’t give him a family, but that isn’t necessarily a deal breaker but he doesn’t know how he will feel in the future. 

He told me he massively respected me meeting up with him and calmly explaining his behaviour about the communication. 

Unfortunately, due to work commitments we had to end the convo, but it was very very confusing for me, he does not like talking about anything like this and yet I felt all this stuff came out and I didn’t know how to make sense of it. Even during the conversation I felt him withdrawing from me and I told him that and he admitted it. 

We left the conversation with the action of each of us deciding whether staying friends would actually work. 

I reflected on it and I messaged him telling him that I would be open to dating again but only if he genuinely thought there may be potential
In this. But if not, then I didn’t l think we should remain friends and should leave it.

He read my message and hasn’t responded. That’s ok I expect him to take some time to reflect. Was all of this because he wanted to keep me around for casual sex? What’s going on here because I’m so confused? ",1,1765100896.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

1pgeira,https://v.redd.it/81vafmsv5r5g1,GUIDE: How to remove broken point using Alum Powder,"I recently snapped a point on my Phil Taylor Phase 5’s. I thought I’d put together a guide with what worked for me as I’ve seen it come up a bit on this forum.

What you will need:
-Alum Powder (Indian grocers sell it)
-Saucepan
-Coffee Mug 

Step 1:
Fill saucepan with 2-3 inches of water (water height lower than mug height) and bring to a light boil. Half fill Mug with hot kettle water and place in the middle of saucepan.

Step 2:
Using a teaspoon, scoop the Alum Powder one spoon at a time and stir until the water is concentrated and the Alum will no longer dissolve. Don’t worry if there’s extra Alum sitting in the bottom of the Mug.

Step 3:
Place the dart barrel in the mug of Alum water. After a minute or so you should see the chemical reaction begin and a bubble stream leaving the end of the barrel. (See video) Note: this reaction only affects the steel point and not the tungsten barrel. I only use natural barrels so I’m not sure if colours are stripped, but I assume not. 

Step 4:
Every 10-15 minutes the water in the saucepan and mug will need to be periodically inspected and topped up to replace the evaporated water. When the mug water is topped up, more Alum may need to be added to keep it concentrated - you can judge whether the Alum needs a top up or not based on the bubble stream reaction from the barrel. I tend to keep it as concentrated as I can..and might over do it but I’ve never had an issue.

Step 5:
Remove barrel from mug and inspect once reaction has stopped and there’s no point remaining. I’m impatient and tend to remove the barrel every hour or so to inspect how much is remaining. The last little bit of the point can usually be knocked out with the point of another dart. The whole process takes me around 6 hours.

Hope this helps!

1pgeh9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1pgeh9r/not_significant_improvement_on_elvanse_vyvanse/,Not significant improvement on Elvanse (Vyvanse),"Hello everyone,

I started my titration about a month ago. They put me on 30mg of Elvanse to begin with. The first day wasn’t great I didn’t  really feel any improvement. Maybe there was some benefit, but the nausea, headaches, and lack of appetite made it hard to notice anything positive.

By the second day those side effects had pretty much gone (apart from reduced appetite), but I still didn’t feel much improvement in my ADHD symptoms (to be fair, it was the weekend and I’m not usually very productive then). From day 3 onwards, though, I definitely noticed an increase in the desire to do things. Hard to explain, but internally it felt like I needed to get things done and I actually enjoyed doing them.

I’m doing a part-time MSc  and working full-time as an engineer, so that boost in motivation really helped me get into some uni work. But even with that increase in drive, my working memory and attention didn’t change much. I still find myself re-reading paragraphs and distracted a lot and although the constant “thought noise” reduced a bit, it wasn’t a huge difference. My brain does feel a bit calmer, though. It’s a bit like having a strong coffee that lasts all day but without the jitters.

A few days ago I increased to 50mg, but I honestly don’t feel much difference from 30mg. So now I’m not sure what to think. I don’t know if Elvanse just isn’t the right medication for me, whether I need more time on this dose, whether it’s related to my suspected autism (undiagnosed, but I think I might be on the spectrum), or whether I should consider a different medication family altogether.

Has anyone experienced something similar?

Long story short, he's being pushed into meetings with Workwise and threatened with benefit sanctions but is far too vulnerable and is struggling with the real world.  He can barely keep it together on an outing for coffee.  He's in a really shit situation and I think he's just being passed through the processes by MSD.

1pgeczi,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1pgeczi/tifu_by_snooping_on_my_partners_phone_for_the/,TIFU by snooping on my partner’s phone for the first time ever and opening a door I’m not sure how to close,"I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for three years. We live together, I moved cities for him, changed my career path (I’m not mad about because I found a niche job that I actually enjoy) to be here, and I genuinely thought we were solid. But for the past month he’s been distant. Not cruel, just absent. Quiet, on his phone constantly. I brought it up twice. He apologised twice. Nothing changed.
Yesterday I accidentally drank coffee way too late in the day and couldn’t sleep. My brain was racing. And this awful instinct just hit me like a truck: check his phone.
I’ve never snooped on a partner. Not once. But his phone was on my bedside table, I knew his password. I told myself it was just to calm my anxiety.
Instead, I blew up my whole night.
I found a message with someone I didn’t recognise. Short, vague, but it looked like he was asking them out for a drink. It wasn’t explicitly flirty, so I tried to stay rational. Sometimes he goes out with work friends. Fine.
Then I opened TikTok.
There were DMs between him and some girl I’d never heard of. A week’s worth. He told her he wanted to cuddle her. They were talking like they had this little emotional world together. He was investing in it. He had the energy for her that he didn’t have for me.
I saw red. My brain left my body. This is a person who’s always been so gentle, so seemingly loyal.
I woke him up, yelling, crying, shaking him, demanding answers. I’m ashamed of how frantic I was, but in the moment it felt like the floor dropped out from under me. He denied it at first. Then when I showed him the messages, he tried to grab his phone in this panicked way I’d never seen before. Then he shut down completely and kept saying, “We can’t do this. I’m so embarrassed. We can’t live like this.”
I told him I didn’t want to break up. I moved my entire life for this relationship. He just kept saying he didn’t know why he did it. That he liked the attention. That we were “stuck in a rut.”
I saw he’d taken nude photos and videos of himself and probably sent it to her. Instead of making me angrier, it made me weirdly sad because he used to send me things like that when we were at our strongest. We don’t sext anymore. Our sex life slowed down. We’re 23 and somehow turned into “once a week” people and both of us have felt the lack of passion.
In my panic, I said maybe we could have a semi-open relationship, no sex with others, but if he needed validation or flirting or attention, we could set boundaries. I even said I’d do the same if I wanted, I can’t lie i missed feeling wanted and adored by strangers.
He apologised. We calmed down. I still couldn’t sleep.
Then I did something stupid: I took screenshots of their messages before confronting him. I know that’s bad. But I didn’t even end up needing them because I confronted him immediately.
Before sleeping, he blocked her on TikTok and WhatsApp.
After he fell asleep, I messaged her on WhatsApp.
Yeah. I know. I know.
This morning she replied saying she did know about me because she asked him about me. She said he told her he was “lonely in (our city).” Which is insane because… we live together.
So in the morning I asked him again: “Did she know I existed?”
He kept saying no. Over and over.
Finally I told him, “Well, I messaged her.”
He got annoyed (fair enough), but also? He lied to my face four times.
He then said the reason he changed his answer was because last night, when I first asked, he said yes, and I reacted emotionally, so he switched to no because he thought “that’s what I wanted to hear.”
So apparently he was lying to avoid my feelings… but then also lying about lying. My brain hurts.
He told me to block her. I did. Then unblocked her because I’m still desperate for the truth. I deleted the chat and now I’m hoping she replies to my last message (which I can’t even see anymore). I’m debating texting her again. I know it’s messy. I know it’s bad. But my head is spinning.
Right now he says he won’t do it again. He says he wants to fix things. I told him I need transparency and that, because of this whole mess, I get two “snooping tokens” a year. He agreed, but that was definitely me panicking, trying to claw back some sense of control.
I don’t know if I should drop it and try to rebuild, or if I should ask her again what their conversations were really like. I love him so much. I don’t want this to end. But I also want the truth, because I feel like I’m losing my mind.

(ChatGPT told me not to text her again so I’m not)

TL;DR: Snooped on my boyfriend’s phone because he’s been distant. Found cuddling/flirty messages with a girl on TikTok. Woke him up and confronted him. He lied about parts of it. I contacted the girl (he’s mad). Now I don’t know whether to stop digging for answers or pursue the truth. Everything is a mess and I’m heartbroken.

My life has gotten into a state that isn’t too good. I have very few friends. The ones I have are very close and very supportive but they’re very busy and I don’t have much time with them. 

I am not working at the moment and am pretty alone. 

To cut a long story short, life stresses and unhappiness led me to deal with life through chronic coffee and vaping. My consumption is really high. I got signed off work due to mental stress. 

Over time I’ve noticed it’s caused muscle loss and I’m now being screamed at to quit them both. That’s ok, I am happy to do so but when I take them away, it’s going to feel so so painful for me right now. 

I’ve got chronic insomnia now and don’t think I’ve had any REM sleep in months.. 

I already have a fair few good habits. I walk a lot, do qi gong and yoga and mantra meditation. But for the times outside of this, I’m generally vaping a lot. Coffee is minimum one cup per day. I haven’t got much going on or anything that keeps me interested any more. 

Have any of you got any ideas? My health needs to quit the vaping but how am I going to cope without it? I need a replacement.

March 2025, nag-resign ako sa trabaho ko sa Manila dahil sa sobrang stress. For context, 26-year-old civil engineer ako, gayman. Hindi ko naman ino-out loud, pero hindi ko rin dini-deny. Alam mo na ‘yun.

Pagdating ng April 2025, nagsimula ako sa isang construction firm dito sa Zambales. Sobrang culture shock, promise. Iba talaga ang vibe ng probinsya after 5 years sa Manila grind.

As expected, tahimik muna ako sa bagong work. One time, nagpunta ako sa pantry to get hot water for my coffee, tapos andon siya, isang CAD operator na sobrang lakas ng dating. Yung tipong may classic probinsyano features, tapos ngumiti pa sakin. Punyeta, parang biglang tumigil yung mundo ko. Nakatitig lang akong parang tanga.

After nun, parang adik ako sa hot water, tatlong balik sa pantry araw-araw just to see him. Tapos nang binigyan na ako ng tasks, nalaman ko na kailangan ko raw kausapin si “CAD Op”. Plot twist: hindi pala siya CAD operator… electrical engineer pala. And suddenly mas naging attractive siya.

Fast-forward after a month: kailangan ko mag-site visit for a project. Walang driver, so ako nag-drive. Siya nasa passenger seat. Guys… YUNG ONE-HOUR DRIVE NA ‘YUN.
Grabe. Yung feeling na gusto mong halikan, hubaran, laplapin, literal na pinipigilan ko sarili ko. Doon kami unang nakausap nang maayos. Nalaman ko na ka-edad ko lang pala siya… pero may anak. Not married, pero may girlfriend.
As in naramdaman kong nabasag lahat ng fantasies ko, pero sige… imagination is free.

Then came our team building.
Same bed.
YES. Same. Bed.

Pag patay na ang ilaw, bigla niya akong tinanong:
“Okay lang ba… yakapin kita habang natutulog?”

Putangina. Hindi ako nakasagot. Umakyat lahat ng kabadingan ko parang volcano eruption level.

Pumayag ako.
Niyakap niya ako from behind.
After a few minutes… ramdam ko na may gumagalaw sa nipples ko.
Nag-tulog-tulugan ako habang literal na nilalabanan ko ang buong bloodstream ko from exploding.

Hanggang sa… di ko na kinaya.
Humarap ako sa kanya.
Hinawakan ko batok niya.
Hinalikan ko.

And mas nagulat ako when he kissed back.
Hard.
Tapos pumatong siya sakin.

At that moment, gusto ko na lang magpaagos sa nangyayari. Pero then reality hit me, may anak siya, may girlfriend siya… at ako?? Ako yung dapat may self-control.
So umuwi nalang ako. Doon ko na lang pinalabas yung tension.

After nun, medyo awkward siya. Sinabi ko sa kanya na hindi ako magsasabi sa iba.
Ngayon, kapag nagkakasalubong kami sa office, ngiting aso lang ulit siya.

Hay.
Anyway… 3 years na rin akong single.
Baka naman, Redditors? 😌

I’ve always been the type to power through tasks without stopping, mostly because I felt weird taking breaks at home. In the office, grabbing coffee or chatting for a minute felt normal. At home, stepping away from my laptop made me feel like I was doing something *wrong*.

But a few days ago, I forced myself to take a real break — not scrolling my phone, not half-working, but actually getting up, stretching, and stepping outside for literally ten minutes.

And somehow that ten-minute pause reset my entire brain.

I came back to my desk and finished a task I'd been dragging out for hours. Then another one. And another. It felt like I had hit some secret reset button I didn’t know I needed.

It made me laugh, honestly — companies will spend millions on “productivity tools,” but half of us probably just need to walk away from our laptops for a bit and look at something that isn’t a screen.

Ex-friend: Male, Bisexual (he is very open to his gender)
Ako: Female

Friends kami since HS. Same college school din, but after graduating we lost communication. Di na kami masyadong nagkikita or usap. After years na-rekindle yung friendship. Nagkikita na ulit kami at naguusap ng madalas as in araw araw.

Naging active kami ulit magkita. Kami lagi magkasama sa gala, mostly coffee shops lang naman to meet, magkwentuhan at magtake ng photos. The reason of our gala is both of us are having mental problems back then. Burn ako sa work but I am getting better naman na like nakakatulog ng maayos and stuff but sometimes may anxiety pa din, meanwhile siya struggling talaga mentally (will not elaborate the gravity anymore) due to broken relationship and family problems. Yung gala namen every week is naging way namen to help ourselves and each other on our mental battles. Same din kami ng gym nagpamember kami. Wfh ako, office work siya kahit minsan nagwwork kami tatawag yon kahit walang topic basta tawa lang kami ng tawa. Tipong magkasama kami pero after pag mga nakauwi na, dami pading chika and all. Basta pagnagset I make sure na makasama ako kasi siya if sa bahay lang siya malulungkot siya so if gumala kami occupied ang mind niya. 

Minsan nangungutang din siya kasi nasshort siya. I don’t mind naman kasi pag sinabi niya na magbabayad siya sa gantong date, tumutupad naman. Never pumalya sa bayad.

Parang I found a brother/sister from another mother ganon, same goes din for me. 

Then it comes to the point na he started talking to men in tinder. He was obsessively wanting to be in a new relationship. One time he asked me “toxic ba ako?”. He asked this because yung mga nakakausap niya is iniisip na absurd and too much yung mga conditions niya sa relationship. I told him na “lahat naman tayo may toxic trait, some of your conditions are too much naman talaga pero I know where you are coming from. Traumatized ka sa last relationship mo, so better if may makausap ka let them know where you are coming from.” Ganyan friendship namen honest sa isa’t isa. 

Then finally may guy na willing sa conditions niya and mabait talaga. Bf niya until now and everything is going good ata naman, I am legit happy kasi deserve naman niyang ma-treat ng tama. But also, this changes our friendship.

Okay lang naman saken na di na kami masyadong nagkikita that time naguusap pa din kami sa text/messenger. Aside sa Ber month na non busy na for preparing sa holidays and work both, shempre sa jowa na niya i-spend time niya. Ako naman may nakaka-date na din non (bf ko na din now hahahaha landi yarn!). 

Then dumating yung Dec. Birth month niya, nagaya siya na ililibre daw niya ko and promise daw. So nagkasundo na kami ng restau, date and time. I adjusted my time dapat may errands din akong important kasi nga ang tagal na namen di nagkikita non and bday niya. All set na siya Wednesday yung usapan. Tuesday morning nagfollow-up na ako, “tuloy tayo diba?”. No response. I messaged him again nung gabi, still walang reply. Then Wed morning I followed up again, pero wala talaga olats. And I was like “baka busy lang talaga….”

Nung dinner na ng Wednesday na day ng usapan namen na magkikita kami nag-myday, sa exact restau and time… ang nilibre is jowa niya. I was like…. okay?! Tumatakbo na sa isip ko non na sana manlang ni-replyan ako I don’t mind naman na icancel kahit idahilan niya pa na magkikita sila ng jowa niya kasi nga I’m happy for him na may jowa na siya. Pero I feel disrespected and wala pala talagang consideration saken na “ay replyan ko friend ko kasi may usapan kami”? I had to adjust my time para lang hindi na maging drawing yung pagkikita namen as we were close friends and I value it, pero parang hindi naman pala siya ganon saken. But I never reacted sa myday niya or nagreply dun. I felt sad and disrespected.

I’ve been thinking it for days, present ako during sa struggle days niya. Lagi kita sinasamahan wag lang siya magisip ng kung ano ano pagnasa bahay siya. I always check up on him if okay lang ba siya and all. I never hesitated to lend him money. Tapos ganon lang naging balik saken.

After nung story na yun, wala din talaga siya message umabot hanggang Feb next year bago siya nagmessage na parang wala kaming pinagusapan na ng pagkikita namen. Walang sorry, walang Christmas and NY greetings. As in kala mo may amnesia. Di ko na nireplyan. Nagmemessage pa siya the following months ng “hoyyy” and stuff. Tapos nakita daw niya ko sa mall. Niyayaya pa ko sa Aurora festival non. But not a single reply binigay ko sakanya. I basically ghosted him. Then slowly, I muted his chats and accounts sa socmed. Para di ko na rin nakikita mga posts and stories niya kasi naaalala ko ginawa niya. Eto lang din kasi naisip kong way to protect my mental health na pinaghirapan kong ayusin ulit. And we are adults, I don’t think he doesn’t know why I never talk to him again. Alam niya yung ginawa. Yet not a single sorry or like “huy di na tayo nakapagkita non lumabas kasi kami”.

I also found out na he was asking me to our mutual friends, if may nakkwento daw ba ko sakanila dahil nga di ako nagrereply na sakanya. Last message ko is follow up sa suppose to be panlilibre niya saken sa bday niya. I never shared what he did to others, I told them na sabihin nalang if nagtanong ulit na busy ako. Ayoko na ikwento sa iba na parehas kaming kilala dahil ayoko pinaguusapan mga personal matters na ganto. If he really wants to reach out, he can ask me directly na “anong prob bakit di ka nagrereply” pero yung mga naging messages niya na saken from feb and the following months are “hoyyy” “alam mo ba ganto ganyan” “sama ka sa aurora?” “nakita kita parang may inaantay ka” hindi niya ma-open yung dapat pagkikita namen at kung ano anong messages sinesend na parang walang nangyare, that’s why ang conclusion ko is alam niya kung bakit ako badtrip sakanya. Nakita mo pala ko sa mall bakit di mo ko nagawang lapitan? Because you know what you did and cannot handle the elephant in the room, I don’t see naman the sense to open it first dahil wala naman akong ginawang mali, tigas ulo yarn hahahaha.

Now before 2026 comes, gusto ko na din iunfriend sa lahat ng socmed. OA ba tong gagawin ko? OA ba yung ginawa kong pandidedma sakanya after ng ginawa niya? OA ba yung reactions ko? Kasi may side na iniisip ko na ang toxic mo self or ang OA mo naman… 

Dinikta ko na nga lang sa isip ko na after cutting him off, ang dami nangyayare magaganda sa life ko. Nagka-bf, nakapunta ng Australia for work related and trainings to level up skills ng libre, maganda ulit naging increase ko ulit, nakakuha pa ako ng profit share sa company, nakapagthailand, nakapagsamal, tapos latest achievement is nakabook ako ng flight for my mom as a gift sa birthday niya for next year dahil wish niya to first time niya mag-airplane! Like iniisip ko is removing negative people and energy will welcome positive things. 

Mali ba ako sa actions ko towards him and naging mindset ko? ",1,1765098334.0,OALangBaAko,1,1.0,False
1pgdxx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pgdxx0/20_days_sober_the_i_deserve_one_trap/,20 days sober - The “I deserve one” trap,"Day twenty is done. Maybe from the outside it’s just another tick on a calendar, but for me, this is a big deal.

This past week was rough: overtime, tons of coffee, rushing around. And that’s exactly when the old reflex shows up:  
*“You handled all this, you got through it, you deserve an ice-cold beer.”*

That voice is like an old program burned into my brain. It flashed up on Friday and again on Saturday, but this time, I didn’t follow it. I didn’t head out to the store to buy booze, didn’t start bargaining with myself. I just said *no.*

I’ve realised the reward isn’t a bottle of alcohol. The reward is waking up clear, not dizzy, and knowing that I’m the one making the decisions, not a habit or an impulse.

On Saturday night I watched *Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot (2018)*. It came at exactly the right moment. It’s a raw, honest story about a man who completely fell apart because of alcohol, and then tried to rebuild himself piece by piece. It’s slow, difficult, painful and deeply human.

These 20 days are about the same thing for me: picking up my own pieces.  
If you’re fighting your own old reflexes, here’s what I’d say: say no to that voice, and choose a reward that actually does you good. For me, this film was that reward.

Around March of last year I (M25) was able to buy my own home at a pretty young age (at least for today’s standards) with the money I made from an editing job I have. I worked hard straight out of college and have made a really decent life for myself. I’m gay but pretty sure I’m asexual and not interested in kids or a relationship so the house is just strictly mine for now. 

My older brother (31M) on the other hand isn’t so lucky and fell into some pretty hard times earlier this year. In June my brother lost his job and as a direct result of this would not be able to pay rent anymore. His wife (32F) was pregnant at the time so I allowed them to move in with me knowing the baby would live here for some time after arriving. 

My mother (58F) and I have a complicated relationship. We didn’t speak for 3 years after I came out as gay and I’m typically not invited to family gatherings or holidays anymore. This doesn’t bother me and I’m glad to have her out of my life. Once again on the opposite side of me is my brother who absolutely adores my mom and does everything she says. Despite my successes I’ve never been enough for her and was done trying to be a long time ago.

One day while I was sitting in my kitchen drinking some coffee my brother approaches me and asks if she can come stay with us for extra support, I said no but I could tell they needed it so I changed my mind. 

The first and immediate red flag was when she first arrived. My mom has always been obsessed with circumcision, I don’t know why but she’s always talked down on people who don’t cut their babies and that logic applied to my brother. There wasn’t a conversation that would go by without her mentioning it to my brother. 

My brother and his wife ultimately made the choice to not circumcise and she was utterly livid. She packed her bags and left for a couple weeks. Once again was extremely glad she left but it wouldn’t last. She came back 3 weeks later with books, pamphlets and all sorts of wacky sources about why my brother just ruined his son’s life, how he’ll never find anyone now and that they’re horrible parents.

She didn’t stop at this, the formula the baby drank, the diapers the baby was wearing, the toys, damn even his clothes were all being dictated to by our mom. She had control over everything and i could see how it was destroying my brother’s wife from the inside.

One day she was talking through skipping vaccinations with my brother’s wife, practically demanding she didn’t vaccinate him. She was on the verge of tears and I’d had enough. I went upstairs, packed her suitcase and told her to get the fuck out and not to come back this time. She blocked us on everything and we haven’t heard from her in 6 weeks but my brother thinks I was too hard on her and that she was just trying to help. Was I? I think I did the right thing but maybe it was just her weird way of helping. Would appreciate any comments.",26,1765097338.0,AITAH,17,0.97,False

I have a balcony opposite side with a coffee take and chair so I can take breaks and get fresh air so it’s nice !  


Got two red Chinese dogs ? Or dragons from an antique store also they seemed dope and gave off that cyberpunk vibe also.

My desk wobble is practically non existent also unless I’m being agressive with the mouse at top height. I hardly notice it at all.

Maybe this can give some idea or inspiration for people who want a similar setup.

And also I have 3 monitor mounts Incase I ever upgrade to full PC or a second machine motor I’ll have it ready.



The things that only bother me with this setup is the Logitech speakers are more for PC I wish it had a dial volume adjuster atleast to control the bass when not n connected to a laptop

And the mounts do slide back but I fixed it putting some double sided tape under the clamp to get traction so it doesn’t slide.

Should Wait, Move On, or Let My Mom Talk to Him for Clarity?","Hi, im 24F and my ex is 25M, I met my ex about two years ago when I was still in college and he was my senior. We started talking after I approached him with a casual excuse. We eventually met, started texting regularly, and got close. Around this time, he began working while I was still in college preparing for placements, and I felt a bit insecure because he was already ahead in his career.

A few months into the relationship, he followed a new junior from college who had just joined. I felt uncomfortable and told him, and he unfollowed her. Later, she approached him in front of his friends, sent him a follow request directly, and then also began sending him snaps. Snapchat became a recurring issue between us, and we argued about it often.

I’ve always had more male friends because I never fit in well with the girls in my college. I was still on good terms with my ex-boyfriend because we ended on good terms. My boyfriend knew this and understood my background with my friend group.

During the Snapchat issues, he also told me about an airhostess he interacted with before we started dating. He paid for her coffee twice, exchanged numbers to settle the money, and later they followed each other on Instagram from their main and private accounts. She also sent him snaps. This was another thing that made me uncomfortable.

When I finally got my internship, it started much later than my friends’, and the stipend was lower. He earned significantly more than me. Once, when he asked me about my stipend, I jokingly said it might be more than his. He took it seriously, looked upset, and left my place. Another time, when I asked him to hold my laptop, he said he “wasn’t in a position to,” referring to the salary difference. This really affected my confidence, and I started feeling like I didn’t deserve the opportunities I had earned.

We used to spend a lot of time together. He came over to my house often, hung out with my mom and me, and sometimes we’d go out together. We met during lunch hours since our offices were nearby, and he usually dropped me to the metro.

The breakup happened on a day when my manager was absent and a senior, married colleague offered me a lift since he was leaving early. I took the ride because I wanted to reach early and meet my boyfriend. He dropped me near my boyfriend’s office. Just ten minutes earlier, my boyfriend had told me to wait because he was coming to pick me up. When I met him, he got upset and raised his voice, asking why I had sat in another man’s car when he was coming. I got offended and asked him to drop me off. I left but realized I had acted impulsively and asked the driver to take me back. When I called my boyfriend, he told me to leave him alone. Later he even called my mom and asked her to tell me not to contact him.

Another factor was his childhood friend who lived nearby. She often fell sick and he took her to the hospital several times. I didn’t mind initially, but after a few times, I felt she could have managed on her own since she had been living in the city long enough. I met her once and she was nice. She had another friend preparing for a beauty pageant. He had once complimented her saree and later commented on her pageant post because his childhood friend asked him to. When I asked him about it, he showed me their chats.

After I moved back home post-college, we couldn’t meet daily, and the distance created more arguments. My office was far, and another senior, married colleague often dropped me and my manager home. My boyfriend didn’t like that and felt the colleague was “too nice.”

We also had fights about communication. One night he went out with friends and didn’t inform me when he reached home, and I stayed awake worrying. The next day, a friend of mine invited me for a bike ride with his group, and I went. Later that day, I noticed my boyfriend followed a beauty pageant girl, and he admitted he did it to make me feel guilty.

I met my ex about two years ago when I was still in college and he was my senior. We started talking after I approached him with a casual excuse. We eventually met, started texting regularly, and got close. Around this time, he began working while I I met my ex about two years ago when I was still in college and he was my senior. We started talking after I approached him with a casual excuse. We eventually met, started texting regularly, and got close. Around this time, he began working while I was still in college preparing for placements, and I felt a bit insecure because he was already ahead in his career.

A few months into the relationship, he followed a new junior from college who had just joined. I felt uncomfortable and told him, and he unfollowed her. Later, she approached him in front of his friends, sent him a follow request directly, and then also began sending him snaps. Snapchat became a recurring issue between us, and we argued about it often.

I’ve always had more male friends because I never fit in well with the girls in my college. I was still on good terms with my ex-boyfriend because we ended on good terms. My boyfriend knew this and understood my background with my friend group.

During the Snapchat issues, he also told me about an airhostess he interacted with before we started dating. He paid for her coffee twice, exchanged numbers to settle the money, and later they followed each other on Instagram from their main and private accounts. She also sent him snaps. This was another thing that made me uncomfortable.

When I finally got my internship, it started much later than my friends’, and the stipend was lower. He earned significantly more than me. Once, when he asked me about my stipend, I jokingly said it might be more than his. He took it seriously, looked upset, and left my place. Another time, when I asked him to hold my laptop, he said he “wasn’t in a position to,” referring to the salary difference. This really affected my confidence, and I started feeling like I didn’t deserve the opportunities I had earned.

We used to spend a lot of time together. He came over to my house often, hung out with my mom and me, and sometimes we’d go out together. We met during lunch hours since our offices were nearby, and he usually dropped me to the metro.

The breakup happened on a day when my manager was absent and a senior, married colleague offered me a lift since he was leaving early. I took the ride because I wanted to reach early and meet my boyfriend. He dropped me near my boyfriend’s office. Just ten minutes earlier, my boyfriend had told me to wait because he was coming to pick me up. When I met him, he got upset and raised his voice, asking why I had sat in another man’s car when he was coming. I got offended and asked him to drop me off. I left but realized I had acted impulsively and asked the driver to take me back. When I called my boyfriend, he told me to leave him alone. Later he even called my mom and asked her to tell me not to contact him.

Another factor was his childhood friend who lived nearby. She often fell sick and he took her to the hospital several times. I didn’t mind initially, but after a few times, I felt she could have managed on her own since she had been living in the city long enough. I met her once and she was nice. She had another friend preparing for a beauty pageant. He had once complimented her saree and later commented on her pageant post because his childhood friend asked him to. When I asked him about it, he showed me their chats.

After I moved back home post-college, we couldn’t meet daily, and the distance created more arguments. My office was far, and another senior, married colleague often dropped me and my manager home. My boyfriend didn’t like that and felt the colleague was “too nice.”

We also had fights about communication. One night he went out with friends and didn’t inform me when he reached home, and I stayed awake worrying. The next day, a friend of mine invited me for a bike ride with his group, and I went. Later that day, I noticed my boyfriend followed a beauty pageant girl, and he admitted he did it to make me feel guilty. After the breakup, he followed the junior, the airhostess, and the pageant contestant again, and they interacted too. He also changed his profile picture to one where he was wearing his childhood friend's scarf.

One guy literally showed me his system — it was a mix of Excel, voice notes, and ""I just remember."" 😅

It got me thinking: why isn't there something dead simple and mobile-friendly for small operations here? Not a massive ERP system that costs thousands and needs a PhD to set up. Just the basics — track products, log sales, see what's running low — all from your phone.

I'm actually considering building something like this. Super lightweight, works on mobile, and would probably cost less than a fancy coffee subscription (\~50 AED/month).

But before I go down that rabbit hole, I want to know:

1. **Is this actually a pain point for you?** Or do most people have it figured out?
2. **What's your current setup?** (Even if it's chaos, no judgment)

1pgdb0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pgdb0f/my_coworker_joked_about_my_protected_medical/,My coworker joked about my protected medical information in front of me and another coworker,"Buckle up, because it’s gonna be a bumpy ride.

To preface, I work in healthcare. When I started, there was just four of us (one manager) and everyone got along really great in every way. Throughout the summer, we would all stop and talk at our cars before going home at the end of the evening, we would buy coffee for each other, and worked really hard for each other. We really were a perfect team, or so I thought. Fast-forward to December my one coworker (the problem coworker- let’s name her Sarah) said she was writing an email. She was very vague about it, but said she was “gathering all the evidence she needed.” turns out, she was mad at me for making more money because she thought she worked harder than me. That email was to the Director of Operations saying that she should get a raise because she does certain things more than me. What she didn’t see was all the other delegated work that I was doing that our boss had asked me to do. I said nothing because my Director of Ops and manager protected me. That same month I caught her and our other coworker (Sam) making fun of me. I reported it to HR and she got in trouble for bullying and harassment. 

While I thought that would have fixed it for the most part, I have caught her doing little things here and there that made it known that she was not interested in actually being friendly. While that was not the goal, if you’re gonna smile to my face with people around, don’t think that I’m not going to notice when you make faces/stop talking to my other coworker (let’s call her Mandy, also a friend outside of work) when I walk in a room- just little things that indicate I’m not welcome or that they are talking about me. I have largely ignored this, and have thought to myself she’s surely gotten over the fact that I am over six years older with seven more years of working experience in healthcare and that’s why I make more than her. Turns out she’s not. She’s done multiple things since then to sabotage me, including messaging my boss and owner of the building that we work at (without me in the group chat)stating that a sample pick up was missed because of my fault. Turns out the UPS person never showed up that day.

Since then my boss and I have gotten pretty close. while talking about this issue and how to fix it, she mentioned how there were over 15 incidences where, even if a situation did not pertain to me, my coworker had managed to bring me up in some negative capacity. She said that she was starting to be worried about the behaviors that she’s displaying in regard to me.

Following that talk with my boss, the new coworker Mandy had started. I could tell as soon as Mandy got there that she thought I wasn’t shit. Without getting into all of that, she finally saw that I wasn’t an idiot and knew how to do my job and since has relaxed. I could tell that all of this was probably because Sarah had told her that I didn’t do nearly as much work as her for more compensation. 

The other day we were talking in their office about our jobs. She had mentioned how there was a period of time when everyone was out of work for different reasons and that an old coworker was by themselves (Sam) completely overwhelmed due to the work that they had to do on their own. (This is all in reference to the fact that we are about to get busy again.) Sarah proceeded to make the comment “none of us are allowed to go septic again haha” 

Mandy said  “YEAH” and looked me dead in the face. 

I said “oh you told her?” 

Sarah “yeah haha lol 🤪”

Last year I had emergency surgery that left me in the hospital for six days, then had to undergo IV antibiotic infusions daily for six weeks. I thought I was gonna fucking die. I had no real reason to go downhill the way I did so quickly at the age of 28, and had no family to help me.

I proceeded to go into my office and teams her that it was completely unprofessional to divulge my protected health information to a coworker that I didn’t know. She said she was sorry, she would never do it again, blah blah blah. 

What’s worse is the doctor that owns the clinic we work in is also my primary healthcare provider. So I am sure that she has looked at my chart before. Luckily we can see with IP addresses who has viewed or altered anybody’s chart so I procured a 20,000 row excel spreadsheet that I have to go through. I am sure she has looked up my chart before.

We literally work in healthcare- SHE KNOWS ABOUT HIPAA VIOLATIONS. I’m so beside myself and have no idea how to handle it. She has repeatedly disrespected, excluded, undermined, and tried to embarrass me. I don’t even know where to begin. There’s only four of us, and all four of us are essential. But I want the book thrown at her. I have never known somebody to attack another person so repeatedly and get away with it.

Tell me this is utterly insane and that I need to go to HR along with any other advice you may have, please.

Long story short it ended up coming crashing down and the headstock smashed right off. Repair place were not sure if they’d be able to fix it and would be over a month before I’d get it back if they could. Devastating. 

I now think it might just be easier to get a new one, especially if this might not be salvageable and I may be able to make a claim under my home/contents insurance for the cost of the guitar, which was around 550. 

My dilemma is this, I love the Les Paul 
and when I bought it a year ago I really wanted the Gibson but decided my skill level didn’t really warrant it and I’d be better off with the epi for a few years until I improved and then maybe I’d treat myself. I’ve been playing about 2 years, play every day and would probably class myself as about an intermediate now, although still nowhere near where I want to be. Should I spend the extra £2k on the Gibson or is it really not a justifiable purchase for someone who currently just plays at home at a fairly basic level?",2,1765095157.0,Guitar,15,1.0,False
