today i had very dark stool, i can’t tell if it’s very very dark brown or black, but i’ve never had black stool before so i am not entirely sure how it looks. it wasn’t tarry or sticky, texture/shape was normal but the second time i went there was some that sank and kind of had a coffee grounds-like texture i think (but i’ve had this texture before with normal color diarrhea). there was also a black or almost-black speck on one normal brown piece. i read that blueberries can cause dark stool and i ate two blueberry muffins yesterday but i really don’t think there’s enough blueberries in those to cause that amount of dark stool. it was also a kind of dark yellow when i wiped? 

i will contact my doctor regardless but does this sound like i should go to the ER in a few hours or would it probably be okay to wait to talk to my regular doctor tomorrow? ",1,1769343879.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

Since then I've had a new OLED & now a new Switch 2 console. I transferred over my game saves & Friday decided what the heck I should probably finished Brilliant Diamond. I gave up just outside Sunnyshore & the last Gym. I loaded into my game Friday & only had time for a few hours in the morning & a quick couple of battles in what I consider the evening. All of it was fought in daylight. 

This morning I woke with a terrible migraine at 3am. So after a cup of coffee, pills & a granola bar I loaded into my game to find it still sunny in game. At about 4am.

I looked up the Day Night time cycle 

Morning 🌅 |     4am - 9:59am
Day 🏞️  |            10am - 7:59pm
Night 🌃 |           8pm - 3:49am

I must have just missed night turning into day at 4am. At least, I hope I did. I remember the game having a golden hue & I thought that was twilight & morning but I may be wrong. So I took some screenshots of my current game & started a new save on my other profile. It's this what morning looks like in game? The sky a dusty powder blue? If so what time of day is the golden hour I'm thinking of? 

My real concern is my save is somehow busted because it moved from multiple consoles & the whole Gamefreak ties your saves to the console & internet time so tightly in this game I'm now stuck in forever daytimes because my saves crossed time & space.

So can someone please tell me what Morning, Day & Night look like in this game!? I keep looking online but can't find any decent articles that actually show the differences between Morning & Day. I took the Morning image here in my new game save an hour ago. I find the other 2 images on Google. But I can't tell what is Morning & what is Day. If I didn't know from Adam I would think the gold sky is Morning, blue sky is Day, the dark sky is Night. But apparently I'm just stupid.

Can anyone please help me? I feel like I'm losing my mind. Show my screenshots if you have any, all of mine from my old Switch are now gone.",3,1769343779.0,PokemonBDSP,1,1.0,False

I hadn’t dated anyone for about three years after a very hard breakup, so I was extremely anxious about meeting someone again. I was scared, but eventually I went on the date.

I liked him quite a lot, but early on I felt that the interest wasn’t really mutual. For example, on the first date (just a coffee and a croissant), he didn’t pay, and he often replied very late to messages. Still, I kept seeing him.

We went on two more dates. On the third one, I went to his place and we had sex. At the time, the dynamic of the relationship revolved a lot around physical intimacy, and after that I only saw him at his place. We met two more times, always at his home, and always had s ex. Looking back, it was more of a hookup than dating.

An important detail is that before we ever had sex, he clearly told me he didn’t want a relationship, and I said that was okay for me. On his Hinge profile, he also stated that he wasn’t looking for a relationship.

At that time, I was still a virgin for personal reasons, and I had my first sexual experience with him. I told him it wasn’t a big deal and that he shouldn’t attach too much meaning to it (it kinda didn't have, I wanted to get rid of it)

Despite what he said about not wanting anything serious, we did share moments of closeness, tenderness, and presence, which confused me and made me hope for more.

Over time, I noticed that instead of feeling chosen, I was trying to prove my worth. He didn’t invest, didn’t initiate consistently, and didn’t show much generosity, emotionally or otherwise. Still, I stayed, hoping that if I gave more, he would eventually choose me.

Eventually, he stopped talking to me altogether... he didnt ""ghost"" lets say but he didn't reply to my last message in the conversation, since 2 months, and I didn't try to talk again too.

2 months later later, I saw that he had updated his dating profile saying he was open to a long-term relationship. That hurt deeply. It made me feel rejected, replaceable, and like there was something fundamentally wrong with me. I felt not chosen.

This situation triggered a painful belief I already had inside me: that I am not enough. I started comparing myself to other women and wondering what I did wrong. I am wondering why he didn't me, I was dealing while meeting him, and still dealing, with a big lack of self esteem and I know it, even though I don't show it. I wonder what I did wrong, if I was too much, if I gave too much, if I was too performative? It hurts me because I was really attracted to him.",1,1769343711.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My girlfriend (32) and I (32M) have been together for about three months. Overall, things are going really well, strong connection, good communication, no major issues so far. This is the first situation where I’ve felt genuinely conflicted.

She’s been taking private golf lessons with an instructor who’s over 60 for around 2 months. After every lesson, they go out for coffee together. On top of that, he sends her songs on WhatsApp, as it referenced about her which already feels a bit unusual to me.

Recently, she also invited him to her office where she works, it’s a pretty fancy office just to show him around.

Another thing that made me pause: I gave his contact to a friend who reached out asking about golf lessons, and he said he has no availability on weekends. Yet he always seems to have time to get coffee with my girlfriend after her sessions.

What complicates this for me is that while I genuinely trust my girlfriend and don’t think she has bad intentions, there’s also a part of me that wonders if she might be a bit naive about the situation. This is a man in his 60s, communicating frequently with a young, attractive woman half his age, and some of the interactions don’t feel purely professional anymore.

I don’t want to sound like I’m blaming her she’s been trustworthy so far, but I also wonder: should someone in their 30s know better about potential boundary issues like this? Or is it reasonable that she might see it as harmless and not think twice about it?

I also want to be transparent that I’ve had a bad experience in the past where I trusted someone completely, and it turned out they were involved with an older man in a way that was much more inappropriate than I realized at the time. Because of that, I’m aware I might be more sensitive to situations like this.

I’m not trying to control who she sees or accuse her of anything. I just don’t know how to balance being trusting with not ignoring something that genuinely doesn’t sit right with me.

So I’m looking for advice on:
Is this kind of dynamic normal for a coach, student relationship?

How would you approach a conversation about this without sounding controlling or suspicious?

How do you tell the difference between valid intuition and projecting past trauma?

Any honest perspectives would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.",1,1769343679.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I was super excited to start and was quickly promoted to Shift Lead with a few other baristas the week before our Ballers left…..since then things have gone down hill. hours got slashed dramatically, leaving three people from open until about 8am every morning, 5-6 for midshift and who knows for night (I don’t work nights), barista attitudes skyrocketed and conflict and drama started almost immediately. (Told my stand manger with no care for it) My stand manager was barely around during our training, and now the ballers are gone, when we need help and call them they never answer the phone or our texts. We get ignored and can only talk to them when they randomly come in. We just got our inspection and it went horrible on the first go which is already a red flag. I notice some other SL’s don’t due their jobs efficiently, start drama amongst other SL’s, and nothing gets done. 

A lot of baristas have cried their way into SL positions which defeats the purpose of being elected as one for knowing how to do the job well, and it realizing I stress way too much over a closet sized coffee shop stand. I’m considering quitting or transferring, but seeing some horror stories of other stands, I’d rather stick it out with the toxicity I know.

1qmhnxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1qmhnxd/is_upgrading_to_a_moccamaster_actually_worth_it/,Is upgrading to a Moccamaster actually worth it if I’m fine with my cheap drip machine?,"I’m currently using a very basic drip coffee maker, an Aroma Boy that cost me around $40. It’s a simple single-stream drip machine. I make one cup a day, about 300 ml, and honestly the coffee is fine. Not amazing, but good enough that I don’t feel unhappy drinking it.

Lately I’ve been thinking about upgrading, mostly because I keep looking at Moccamaster machines, but I’m stuck wondering whether this is a real upgrade or just curiosity getting the better of me.



The Cup-One seems like it should be perfect for my routine since it’s designed for one cup. But at the same time, the actual brew style doesn’t look fundamentally different from what I already use. It’s still a single-stream drip, just with better temperature control and better build quality. At around $230, I’m not sure that translates into a big enough difference in the cup for someone like me.

From what I’ve read, the improvement sounds more like better consistency and a slightly cleaner brew, not a dramatic change in flavor. That’s nice, but I keep asking myself if that’s really worth spending several hundred dollars when I’m not dissatisfied to begin with.

I’ve also been thinking about the KBG Select. New, it’s clearly expensive, but I could get one used for about the same price as a new Cup-One. On paper that sounds like a better deal. The problem is that I still only drink one 300 ml cup a day. Even with the half-pot setting, the KBG feels like a machine designed for more volume than I’ll ever use. I’m curious whether anyone actually uses a KBG almost exclusively for single-cup daily brewing and feels like it makes sense.

There’s also the Bonavita 5-cup in the background. The price is attractive and people seem to like it, but it’s 110V, needs a transformer, and won’t brew less than three cups. For my habits, that already feels like forcing a machine to do something it wasn’t meant to do.



So I keep coming back to the same thought. If I’m already okay with my current coffee, maybe there’s no strong reason to spend $200 to $300 at all. Maybe the smartest move is to just keep using what I have and stop reading gear reviews.

For people who’ve been in a similar situation, especially those who upgraded from very cheap drip machines or use Moccamaster mainly for small brews, did it actually feel worth it? Or did you end up realizing the upgrade wasn’t as meaningful as you expected?

* It was **$3–$5 things every day**
* Coffee + snacks + delivery = 💀 by the end of the month

I have a very small budget. I can save up some money for a rug and new throw pillows, and some wall art. I got the end tables as a temporary thing so I’d be willing to get new ones. Also the lighting is awful. I want to get floor lamps, but where do I put them? 

The last picture, under the window, I have been thinking about getting a desk with chair but will it look awkward next to the love seat? Or 2nd picture, desk where the gray dog bed is. 

I’d really love two chairs and a table in the middle instead of the love seat, but my kids lay on the love seat so it would take away that for them. 

I do have curtains we took them down 6 years to paint and never put them back up lol. Much like the rest of this house!

Started looking for business setup help about a month ago. Got quotes from maybe 6-7 different companies. Most were reasonable but one company quoted me like 8k AED which was half what everyone else was charging.  
Red flags I missed at first:  
No physical office, just met at a coffee shop  
Kept asking for payment upfront before showing me any official documents  
Couldn't give me a straight answer on timeline  
Reviews online were either 5 stars or 1 star, nothing in between  
I almost paid them but something felt off so I kept looking. Ended up going with a place in Business Bay with an actual office I could visit. Paid more but at least I had proper documentation for everything.  
Lesson: if the price seems too good to be true in Dubai, it probably is. The legitimate companies are all within a similar price range for a reason. The government fees alone are fixed, so anyone quoting way below market is cutting corners somewhere.  
Just do your due diligence. Ask to see their physical office, check if they're actually registered, get everything in writing. Basic stuff but easy to skip when you're in a hurry.

Why Am I So Unmotivated And Difficult To Mentally Work With? You Don't Have To Read My Big Message Just Give Me Some Advice. It Was Only For Context.,"Why am I not motivated to do anything? I have autism, ADHD, active mood disorder, bipolar mixed, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety. I was diagnosed then de-diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder as well. All of these have been diagnosed across many doctors and I have a history of going to Psych-wards for depression and some ideations. I struggle to focus and remember things a lot. My memory is really bad or perhaps selective and my drive to even hyper-fixate has become lazy or undriven.

My great grandmother had schizophrenia and would mainly be non-verbal and hallucinate about aliens taking over earth and being in the front yard. Her son, my grandfather, had bipolar disorder and would lock himself in his room in bouts of I don't even know what when my dad was growing up, and all of his siblings seem to have something wrong about them—or at least that is how my dad presents it. I think my grandfather was suicidal. But later my grandfather was put on a medication that helped, but he still is a terrible driver and socially mean to people out of nowhere sometimes; but honestly, he might just be old too and has poor memory and forming of thoughts.

My father has only been diagnosed with a learning disability and dyslexia, so no autism or anything, but I almost feel like I can smell autism now that I have hyper-fixated on it so much and can see my own traits that align with autism being repeated by others who are diagnosed but didn't tell me or are being tested. I know it is a bad habit to try and diagnose people, but I just naturally do it and kind of taught myself to do it to navigate social situations. Sometimes I think I am more socially aware than my neurotypical friends but am too lazy most of the time to care to apply it.

I am no longer sad, mainly due to my medications: Levothyroxine 25 mcg, Sertraline 25 mg, Wellbutrin 150 mg, Depakote 500 mg, and I have just been taken off Paliperidone 3 mg. The reason the Paliperidone is such a low dose is because I have a very long history of being highly reactive to medications, and for some reason it would cause constant nightmares and I wouldn't be able to sleep, but eventually I got used to it and over time we lowered it to try and help my sleep. Also, I switched to Depakote a while back after being on Lithium and having way too high of a concentration of it in my blood because I would barely drink water or any liquids or remember to.

Also my memory is so bad that I never remembered to take my morning meds but only remembered to take my night time meds because they were right by my bed and for some reason I wouldn't be able to fall asleep without taking them. Specifically, if I missed my paliperidone, I wouldn't be able to sleep for all the days I didn't take it, specifically when I ran out and didn't remember or had the motivation to call and refill it.

I am an adult now and it is really hard even though I have way less responsibilities than most adults, and I can tell that. I am highly intelligent but don't even have a diploma because I just couldn't do my homework and eventually became so emotional—back when I wasn't on my current meds—that I actually became phobic of school, I think. Like, I can't go there without feeling bad and going there every day and in classes without melting down and being over-stimulated. I didn't even get my IEP around the 10th or 11th grade for autism; I got it for emotional impairment.

I had lost all of my friends and even now I struggle to control my impulsive behavior. I stream for really long hours and I can't stop myself from repeating the same memes or phrases that no one knows that would honestly get me in trouble if I didn't explain myself, or I would sing the same line in a song over and over. Now for some reason I like projecting gay ""jokes"" onto my friends when in reality I am pretty sure it is because I find the theme of homosexuality stimulating and a good stim. I am so indecisive and struggle with subjective things so immensely that I always catch myself up on the fact that there is no reason to do anything for any reason that I don't begin any action.

I legit choose to identify as agender and abrosexual when in honesty I just identify as a cis-male and maybe I am bisexual, but only dated 2 guys ONLINE when I was like 14 on Discord... (This is a note later when re-reading all of this. Basically I picked agender because I saw the vast amounts of genders as our attempt to expand gender to such an extreme point to include each unique thing about each person and how they feel different and want to be treated a specific way from the rest. Either if that stems from Dysphoria or Dysmorphia or simply you just don't align due to personal identity. I observed that people noticed that gender wouldn't go away so rather they would try to add to society's structure and norms as well as add different groups to change it from the preconceived two-group system to a fluid spectrum one that more aligned with all of their experienced realities.

I just decided not to pick a gender because I understood the same information that we were given but decided to practice what I believed, and that was to have myself and others be treated as themselves and as individuals rather than a specific category within a subject that is honestly so subjective and broad that honestly we are all simply just ourselves at the end of the day and not a specific thing that should be treated just the exact same in every way for that specific category. I do believe in identifying in ways, though, that help people best understand how to treat you. So I still align with being a man because it is hard for me to detach from the biological factor when engaging with other people in my life and how it influences my physiology and biology and it helps others with sex/gender based preferences.

To make it simple, I am just saying that I struggle with subjectivity so much that when asked what gender I am I couldn't choose, so I choose to be gender agnostic lol. I did the same thing with sexuality because I believe there are so many minute differences in every individual I just decided to pick what best described me and that was someone who feels different things at different times—sometimes feels more straight at times and more gay at times and sometimes completely asexual or grossed out by the concept of humans. Mainly after waking up and being on the bus and being in a groggy state and my mind becomes very literal with what I am seeing. Like we have these strings coming out of greasy holes in our heads. What the heck. We are just these brains floating around in liquid covered up by this weird thin layer of a bunch of little cell thing things all laid on top of each other that are somehow stuck together.

Basically I believe we shouldn't at heart pick a gender or at least understand that we are so individualistic that we are simply just ourselves at the most objective standpoint. Same thing with sexuality. You never know what could walk through that door and could get you all flustered. But I still identify with either what best describes me or fits my own desires of what I want others to see of me. Like if I use the pronouns of my birth sex then those who are interested in people with certain ""bodily aspects"" can know what I have easier. I see it as a social tool if anything lol. Also it is more convenient for communication too because if we still base English in a bi-system of he and she while other languages don't, then I feel like my best way of going at it is for some practical use for me and for those I meet.

If I am biologically male and I have features that will help our brains that evolved to pick up on those aspects then they can communicate with me and know also what bodily aspects I have. But I feel like this story is different with people who have Disorders though like Gender Dysphoria or Body Dysmorphia. I also feel like those who care about being called specific pronouns would care too. But like I have mentioned earlier, I have a very low level of care about things so a lot of things don't bother me and I am just trying to logically structure and basically turn everything into a math formula in a way. Like I said, I have autism and this is my way of navigating society.)

Literally one of the jokes I made to one of my friends recently was this: ""We know you're gay Ryan, we found all your femboy photos on a file on my computer."" Then Ryan would ask me why I had photos of femboys on my computer and why would his file of it be stored exclusively on my computer. The thing is I use offensive stuff—or I don't even know what to call it because I wouldn't say being gay is offensive—as a vice or stim to vent out something. Most of the time I am either bored or on VC with my friends.

But I am quiet when going to new places and not loud. Like at my old school I was known as loud and obnoxious, but then I changed schools in the 10th or 11th grade and was known as very quiet and didn't want to be bothered. I feel like I was a better person and human at times when I was 14 because I was in so much emotional pain that it somehow grounded me and made me humble and overly nice and formal. I am not lying that whenever I become sad it is almost like this wave sweeps over me, receding this constant state that I feel at all times that keeps me distracted, and I feel more alive and aware than ever and I feel beautiful. I feel beauty in the sadness perhaps that I have come to know it for so long, and I almost feel like at times that I should go back to it for the sake of everyone else and perhaps myself.

I worried about what would happen once I stopped being sad up until the point it happened. I knew that once it stopped I would stop caring. I became such a jerk. I became more mean and arrogant and almost felt like I was burnt out on sugar and unhealthy food and I am describing that because I am feeling it right now. It is so hard to be motivated and focus and to remember and to care and to feel anything about anyone. I have become so okay with letting go of emotional attachment to things just so I wouldn't suffer because of them.

I have lost all of my real-life friends and everyone my age is now in college. I had a conversation recently with my Arabic friend about the things happening between, I think it was either Israel and Palestine or that other thing going on between the USA and that one country I honestly can't remember. I honestly have bouts of complete lack of empathy either because of my meds or I don't even know what, but I told him that I honestly don't watch the news and that I don't worry about things beyond where I live and the people I see every day and know. I told him that it was just how I emotionally attached. I admitted that the longer I would sit there and try to invest myself into it, the more I could pull sadness out of myself by running myself through the steps of empathy, but nowadays I just don't care or feel anything.

I sometimes feel even more detached to those around me as well day by day. But I am still connected. EVERY SINGLE DAY I think about my grandfather that has passed away. I once in a while regularly think about this friend of mine that I met when I was a younger teen that was homeless and schizophrenic and off her meds and took drugs (that's discord for you lol). I didn't know to believe her on a lot of her claims though, and the day I was told that she had died from the cancer that she developed has stuck with me and I was super analytical about her death and am still not sure about it now, but it still sticks with me. I still have nightmares and dreams about all of my past friends who have left me and nightmares about my grandfather. My dreams aren't even scary a lot of the time but they are highly manipulative and would convince me that I re-became friends with those people or that my grandfather is still alive and that there was a mistake or it never happened, and I would wake up believing it until the pouring reality falls upon me and my heart breaks.

The last two times I tried re-becoming friends with a group of friends I completely had an emotional breakdown trying to talk to them or open my mouth or speak and I can't even understand it. I don't understand why my body has these reactions when my mind or myself tells me that ""it's just them"" or just another human. ""Why am I acting this way?"" It hurt so extremely bad and then we stopped being friends again or they didn't want to be friends again. I had to learn that life was quiet and lonely and wasn't some big show or theatrical story that all the music I would listen to would make me think or what my mind would come up with.

I remember coming home from a new school where I knew no one and it was way bigger than the small-town school I grew up in and I never made a single friend while there. I would feel my cold bed every day I got home and it felt like quietness and it felt like loneliness. I only really have friends online now and I am trying to do YouTube and Twitch but don't have enough focus to edit my videos and I am so socially out of touch I don't even use TikTok or Instagram or anything other than YouTube. And even then I don't watch gaming videos anymore because I always tell myself that I will wait for later when I could make a YouTube video on them, which never ever comes, and I lost a lot of interests that way and fell out of some games' lore or just some funny videos. I don't even play video games anymore unless it is with an online friend and usually for a YouTube video or streaming.

It is 5:07 a.m. and my birthday was yesterday and has ended. My grandfather who passed's wife is in the hospital and I am the only grandchild that has taken care of them while the rest of their family on my mom's side has been mean or never even would call them or help them out. My grandmother's kidneys are having problems. It has been 1 year since my grandfather has passed away. Usually the wife goes soon after.

Oh yeah, also since the age of 14 or 15 I have been dating a girl online and have never gotten the chance to meet her in person and she cheated on me and then went at it horribly when trying to handle it with me where she acted with no emotion the whole time to help my feelings and just said make a decision of if we should stay together and I felt left out on my own. And at the exact same time my last ever real life friend who was actually my first ever life-long school-met friend told me he didn't want to be friends with me anymore, and I think another friend from my past that I wanted to try and be friends with again and I offered front row tickets to my favorite band's concert to go with me told me even though he wanted to go and said yes he still doesn't want to be friends with me and at the time I think I had purchased the tickets and we still ended up going.

After all of that happened I admitted myself into an adult Psych-ward and got 7 thousand dollars in debt with no real good job because I was fired from my last job and now I just work once in a while for my dad. I now have lawyer debt because my sister put me in a court case over something that makes no sense and now I have over 10 thousand dollars in debt and I might go to jail for a month potentially and have to take anger management classes for a year just because I was shadow boxing her while she was cleaning rice for a meal and I poked her with my toe while she was laying down waiting on her food and I was waiting on my water to boil for my food. But because it was unwanted touch—even though she didn't say anything and didn't cry or react or anything which apparently doesn't matter—it still classifies as assault. I have been told it is honestly about how she felt about it, not about if it was actually me hitting her or hurting her. I was just honestly stimming and I have done it a lot growing up where I would leave my room either from being on call with my friends and being over stimulated and I vent by slightly bothering and picking on my sister. She was 17 and I was 18 but because I was legally an adult I am going to be charged potentially... I already got a warrant for my arrest and had to pay bail.

At the same time I still know I am privileged because my father lets me live with him and he buys food once in a while for me to let me eat, but he does get mad if I eat the SpaghettiOs even though he said he got an amount where each can is a dollar. But they're not only mine I think, or they are only my brother's but he doesn't eat them and we don't have many foods and I am too worried to cook and eat them without upsetting my dad because they aren't mine. I have applied to a lot of places but not many people wanted to hire me, a lot due to me not having my GED. I struggle to make it to my GED classes because of motivation or I don't remember. For some reason I feel so scared to pick up the phone or do anything honestly. I don't even refill my meds until I have been off them long enough where I am feeling horrible or am almost out and will still be off them for a couple days.

My father doesn't let me keep anything in any other section of the house other than my room. My rice cooker is in my room and all of my spices aren't allowed in the spice cabinet. I didn't even have a room at his house. I used to have to sleep out on a cot in the under-heated living room with a blanket that was quilted so it had those little holes in it and it was too short for me because I am 6'3. Also the cot was too small and eventually stretched to the point where I was just laying on the ground and it eventually ripped and broke. My dad broke up with his fiancée and her daughters moved out, which they had the only other bedroom in the house other than my dad's, and it laid there completely trashed and animals went in there and tore stuff up and ""relieved"" themselves multiple times in different ways...

There are stickers, markers, chipped paint and holes in the walls because the one daughter who is 11 or 12 now I think has a lot of mental health problems like depression and suicidal ideation and has a problem with vaping and marijuana and has a big problem with boys and to my knowledge sorta girls. I hope people understand what I mean by ""problem"" because I will not elaborate. She just put all the holes in the wall and in our bathroom. Also she got herself two cats when I asked for a cat when I went to a psych ward one time as an emotional support animal after the last time we had a cat on accident it died because my dad's fiancée introduced him and her sister to the dogs and immediately left to go to the bathroom and left them outside and one of the dogs ""Bane-Batman-ed"" him and broke his back and he died. I loved that cat and he made me feel better for some reason. He didn't last for long though.

So my dad's fiancée's daughter got two cats and when they all left after breaking up they just left them here, and even after I kept mentioning that they should get her spayed she got outside and got pregnant by a stray cat and now we have a bunch of kittens and got rid of a lot of them but still have the two original cats and two kittens and they are alright behavior and personality wise. But nothing like that one cat. I learned over time that most cats aren't as loving as the one I had all the way back then and are very self-absorbed and not very loving.

Also my family was very neglectful of all their dogs and all of them have died when we had 4; now we only have one. We had a Beagle, Great Dane, some type of duck hunting dog, and a King Charles Miniature Poodle mix. My dog was the Beagle and he died from either cancer or honestly not being regulated on his food intake. My father had them all as outside dogs and would just leave the bag of food open outside for all of them and when he died my dad said that the amount of food being consumed halved or more and I could tell that his belly or stomach was hard, almost like it was really pressured. The duck hunting dog died due to being attacked by an animal and they didn't know or didn't do anything after knowing it for a couple of days and it was my sister's dog (My sister lives with my mom because she hates my dad). The Great Dane was my Dad's fiancée's dog but they claimed it got too old and her feet were bleeding or something, but she seemed fine to me (also yes she left the dog at our house too but would bring it over to her house once in a while). They decided to put her down. The last one is the King Charles Miniature Poodle Mix. I was told he was my dad's dog but now my father says it is my brother's dog and always has been. My brother is five and is technically my half-brother and was made between my Dad and his fiancée.

Honestly this all turned into a vent and I just wanted some advice on what I should do or anything that has helped out others with autism or similar conditions as me. So please try and comment some advice down below. Like what can I do to motivate me? Or what can I do to understand empathy and morals when they are all subjective and cultural and societal and biased? How can I make a decision? How do I get myself to do those decisions? Are there any remedies like oils or vitamins or coping techniques or therapies?

Also I am curious about Azstarys because Markiplier mentioned it and I'm curious about people's opinion on it of those who have taken it. I don't want to be recommended medical advice by non-medical professionals and would at least be recommended questions that I can ask my primary care doctor about. Also I have done horrible on stimulants. But seem to do fine on Wellbutrin I think, but I don't know if it is the paliperidone or something else but I can't drink coffee anymore or really big caffeine things without shaking a ton and feeling bad and having behavior problems. Also shrimp makes me sick now but that might just be a getting older thing. I used to love shrimp.",2,1769342957.0,autism,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My indoor money plant started declining really suddenly and I’m not sure what’s wrong. I live in the Netherlands and the plant is kept indoors.

It’s been losing a lot of leaves, and some of the stems are turning brown (you can see this in the second photo). I’m not sure if it’s a watering issue, disease, or something else.

So far I’ve tried:
•Spraying it with water mixed with vinegar
•Adding coffee grounds to the soil
• not watering too often, in case I’m overwatering

Ireland is a very beautiful country with green landscapes, rolling hills and a mild climate. 
Most of the Irish mornings are cold and its very difficult to leave the blanket. I grab a quick breakfast, usually a sandwich or oats and rush to catch the tram or bus. Public transportation, especially buses are sometimes late or sometimes early. Classes are a mix of lectures, tutorials and presentations. There are assignments and exams end of each semester.

Grocery shopping is something adventurous. It is difficult to find all the grocery items together in one store. Aldi and Lidl are cheaper to shop groceries while Dunnes stores and Centra is much more expensive. Frozen food items are also available which will make cooking easier. Some products are expensive like spices, cheese. Irish milk and curd tastes amazing.
My routine slowly builds itself around classes, cooking, part-time job if you have and keeping your room tidy. Laundry day is a weekly battle. And I have started drinking more tea and coffee after coming to Ireland.
I miss Bahrain, my parents and all the good people who were always with me that hurts me. Video calls help but it will not be the same as I miss their presence and I am always in those memories. 

However, I always move forward (in addition to studies) by exploring a new country by visiting beautiful places which include Cork, Killarney, Howth, Cobh etc and I hope I will visit much more places in future. Anyhow I have struggled a lot with the new climatic conditions( that make me sick frequently), missing home food, managing money and group assignments.
I have grown stronger and independent after going through all these struggles which will make me more motivated and confident.

Student life in Ireland is a mix of challenges and beautiful moments. Not everything will be perfect. Coming to this new land, I have learned much more about the world.",1,1769342607.0,AbroadEdge,0,1.0,False

Onto the engene version, I did not check the inclusions so I was surprised to see what's inside. It's like a wallet with a frame to display the PVC ID in it, slots for ""debit/credit cards"" which are the photocards (love the stealer pcs), passport, a dollar, poster, stickers, CD, and postcards. I love the photos in the postcards, they were beautifully photographed. My random pulls are Heeseung and Ni-ki. 

I also got Enhypen x Lotte products, they taste so good. The crunky ones are matcha chocolate covered huge wafer rolls that tastes like oreos. I've been craving matcha for 2 days so this came at the right time lol. The pie ones are coffee and coconut flavored though there's no hint of coconut but the coffee taste is strong. The zero ones are sugar free gummy stars and moons with berry flavor. It also had mini photos inside. I got 2 ot7 ones and 1 Jay.

I also got a walk the line glow in the dark moon keyring. It's beautifully made. It's like a small crystal ball with a moon and wtl in it. Love the silver bat on it too. Also have, Enhypen x Wiggle Wiggle luggage tag that I got from their Black Friday sale.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

FA said yes to coffee but said I can’t sustain more emotionally” after 45 days no contact… soft door open or a slow fade?,"Hi everyone, I’d love some insight from this community and people familiar with fearful-avoidant dynamics.

Context (anonymous):

* I’m a guy (30s). She’s a woman (30s).
* We dated years ago, broke up, later rebuilt a close friendship with a lot of emotional intimacy.
* It wasn’t officially romantic lately, but it had “almost relationship” energy at times (emotional closeness, inside jokes, deep conversations, support). Traveled a few times to visit each other. Nothing romantic ever happened.
* She is currently in a relationship with someone else for 4-5 years. her partner is an avoidant. the relationship is emotionally dead and he sees her as a chore not as a partner (her words not mine)
* She has a serious family situation going on (Mother has a degenerative illness).
* We did 45 days of no contact after a heavy/intense period of conversations when she was pulling away. She asked for “a little space to gain perspective“ and I completely retreated the moment she asked for it to give her what she asked
* at day 45  of NC, I sent a calm, low-pressure message basically saying I respect her peace, and I don’t know if shes ever coming back to being friends but I’m not asking to go back to intense communication either. and that if she ever felt comfortable we could either have a short phone call or grab a coffee when I visit her city for work in March. No pressure, no expectations. I was not blocked at all during this time so she got the message and she responded 24 hours after. I put her voice message transcription below (NEED HELP WITH IT)
* My goal is that I want to recover the meaningful friendship part but with a clear emotional “ceiling” (close, warm, but not “emotional partner/confidant/thwrap #1”).

This is the voice note she sent. it was 6 minutes long

She sounded calmer, but also nervous in most parts. Here’s the key content (as accurately as possible):

**Her voice note:**

* “I’ve been reconnecting with myself and surprisingly also with God. I’ve been going to church. I’m in a moment of calm and peace. My Mom’s health hasn’t changed, but I’m learning how to live this process differently.”
* “I wanted to send a voice note because text can be misunderstood. You and I aren’t the same people we were years ago. I wanted you to hear my voice calm. Because we care about each other and there is affection.”
* “I’ll be totally honest: I can’t emotionally sustain more than I already have right now.”
* “I’m not saying our friendship took away my peace. But our last conversations gave me a lot of anxiety. With perspective, I think we both did things wrong. No reproaches. Just… I can’t keep the bond in that same way.”
* “I don’t want any reproaches between us. I respect you and I know you respect me.”
* “From my side, I can’t promise going back to having connection AND fluent communication.”
* “But if you want, when you come to my city we can grab a coffee near our offices and catch up.”
* “Right now I don’t want to force anything… (nervous laugh) I don’t want to be misunderstood. I think I’m okay right now and I think you’re okay too and everything is perfect in that sense.”
* “This conversation isn’t easy for me. I struggle to express myself. But yeah, when you come you can message me and we can meet and talk. Everything is fine, no drama, with respect, affection, and friendship.”

**the confusion (why I’m posting)**

To me it sounds like both:

1. A functional rejection of closeness right now (“I can’t sustain it”, “can’t promise fluent communication”), and
2. Not a full emotional goodbye (mentions affection, friendship, coffee invitation, doesn’t want drama).

So it feels like ambivalence with limits, not a classic “I’m done”.

I’m trying to act secure and not push. I responded warmly and low pressure.

But I’m unsure what to do next.

**Questions for you all  FA and attachment-aware people**

1. From an FA perspective, does this sound like a soft door open (friendship with boundaries) or more like a polite slow fade?
2. Is the “coffee when you’re here” line meaningful or just something people say to avoid awkwardness?
3. Would you prefer silence after this, or occasional low-pressure “anchors” (like a short supportive message every few weeks with no questions)?
4. If you were her, what behavior from me would feel the most safe and non-threatening?
5. If my goal is friendship with an emotional ceiling (warm but not intense), what pacing/strategy would be healthiest?
6. Should I even try at all? I‘m willing to let go as well.

EDIT:

When I come to her town in March on my work trip, should I let her know if she wants to meet?

Any insight would really help as I am a bit new on the whole Avoidant attachment subject. Thanks.",1,1769341691.0,AvoidantBreakUps,2,1.0,False

I'd like to hear some options because I'm confused af.
A year ago me (35f) started working at this new company,where i met this woman (40f).
She works at a different department of the company so  i see her every 2nd week for a couple of minutes.
We clicked immediately for some reason, our behavior was kinda flirty,from both sides, the looks we would share,the compliments,the sweet talk,i felt like there were crazy sparks/ tension between us that we would both try to hide when others were around us. As the time went on we got along pretty well and i found myself coming to her house for coffee and gossip, alot. (She invited me ofc) . Now, 8 months ago i got divorced from my ex husband, she is also divorced with grown kids. I was pretty relaxed the whole time and didn't initiate anything,but there is this other friend of hers( f41) that acts possessive over her and she brought up how her friend's behaviour is weird and that she is not attracted to women. At that point i was even more confused by everything,like there is no way i  imagined all of this stuff between us. And we were both single at the time.So i tried to change,stopped the flirty stuff and just acted normal and after three days she asked me what's wrong with me. She still looks at me differently than she looks at others, especially when there is noone around us,at work. When we are at her house its kinda...""normal"" ,we talk about guys, and how she is going on dates and stuff, so today she told me she got a boyfriend. I guess now I'm stuck,I'll have to meet him, listen about him and their relationship,act like a good friend all while im kinda in love with her. Im pretty grown up and there is no way i imagined all of this,i don't act like that toward any other woman at the moment and i figured she isn't either , there were some moments that made me kinda sure she likes me back. If you watched Stranger Things s5 when Will asked Robin how she knew Vicky likes her back, she told him exactly what happened to me- the shared looks,the signals, the snow ball that instead of turning into an avalanche like in Robin's case,melted in mine lol.  How on earth did I get this all wrong,i feel like i invested a lot of feelings for nothing in the past few months.",1,1769341399.0,lgbt,2,1.0,False

I lived and worked in the US for about 10 years, where dating felt fairly straightforward,  meeting people, having conversations, going on dates, even if things didn’t always work out.

I’m currently living and working in Mauritius because I genuinely fell in love with the island life. Everything else here feels right… except dating.

I’m finding it oddly difficult to even get to the “let’s grab a coffee” stage. Conversations fade, replies take days, plans rarely happen, and it often feels like interest doesn’t turn into effort.

I’m not bitter or rushing anything,  just trying to understand how people actually date here. Is it mostly friend circles? Are apps useful? Is it just culturally more guarded?

Would love to hear from locals or expats who’ve figured it out. What am I missing?",2,1769341297.0,MauriceMauritius,7,0.75,False

I am set to retire at the end of April this year. With a bit of care and some frugality, I will be able to travel - budget style - for a year or so. I did travel with my parents as a kid, but as an adult all my travel has been in Europe. My main hobby interests are languages and literature, so one aim is to get started (finally) on a non-European language - I've decided on Indonesian. Otherwise, I'm a bit slow these days so gentle rambling rather than jungle hiking, and I like basic comfort but glitzy luxury doesn't interest me.

In terms of passing time, I'm happy spending days wandering around, drinking coffee (and maybe the very occasional Mojito), reading on my kindle and writing.

Anyway, my preliminary plan is to fly to Vietnam (probably Da Nang) and combine a relaxed (no trekking or tours) holiday with getting some dental work I need done. I was thinking a month - two tops - for this phase. I think I can do this on a 45-day visa and do a visa run to Laos if I need to.

The next phase would be to spend three months in Bali attending a language school. I've seen a program that is three mornings a week for three months that would suit me fine and has enough flexibility for short - say weekend - excursions. I'm thinking of Sanur as my Bali base. Again, I'm looking for a laid-back time with some beach days and some low key sight-seeing and lots of Warung food.

After this I'd like to fit in a short trip to either Penang or Bangkok, maybe a month, then back to Da Nang for more R&R before heading home.

I am confused/undecided on a couple of points though. For visa purposes do I need to book a London-Da Nang return flight from the start, or can I book a single out and then buy a single back at the end of my trip? Would buying a return at the outset save money? And will I save by booking other legs (Da Nang - Bali, Bali - Bangkok etc) in advance?

Then ticket prices - the variation seems wild. Ideally, I'd fly direct but one or two layovers might be more realistic. The prices offered on websites for the return flight (LDN-DAD) vary from £150 (clearly just click bait) to just under £1000. I am not making much sense of the websites. I don't mind paying a bit more for peace of mind. For example, Singapore Airlines have a ticket via Guangdon that includes luggage/flight transfer and its listed at £642: much more than the bucket shops but affordable for the convenience?

And accommodation - I Europe I often use self-catering airbnb places, but it looks like in south east Asia, guest house style accommodation could be really affordable.

Then I'd appreciate opinions for my 'side trip' to either Penang or Bangkok (or other suggestions). I know Bangkok is fantastically popular and I could fit in a weekend in Chiang Mai but I think Penang would be more laid back and I could have beach time and foodie time.

Anyway, as a complete novice to this sort of travel planning, I'd really appreciate any advice or guidance at all, about travel, accommodation, sights, risks etc.

To the citizens of Aldersyth, this city is a marvel of post-gravity engineering; to me, it is a persistent technical failure of vector misalignments. I don’t see ""ethereal beauty"" in the Spire District’s walkways; I see a 12% gravitational fluctuation that I felt in my joints before the alarms even pulsed. 

The air thickened into a soup of unpredictable weight, making every step feel like wading through wet concrete. My inner ear clicked as the pressure dropped toward a vacuum.

Twenty feet ahead, a melon slipped from a vendor's stall. In a stable environment, it would have dropped. Here, it caught a low-gravity pocket and accelerated along a skewed trajectory. It didn't float; it hunted. It aimed for my head with the velocity of a low-caliber bullet. I dropped. 

 

The carbon-fiber cobblestones were freezing, vibrating with the sub-sonic hum of the city's failing stabilizers. Above me, the fruit shattered against a pylon, spraying pulp like shrapnel. The juice didn't run down; it crawled upward, defying the 1.0g baseline.

Behind me, Finn’s espresso cart rattled past. He wasn’t a ""whimsical vendor""; he was a man losing sixty credits an hour to gravity spikes. ""Calibrate your stabilizers, Finn!"" I yelled. I rolled as a ceramic cup launched from his counter. 

Because the pressure was high but the gravity was low, the coffee didn't form spheres; it atomized into a scalding, bitter mist that scorched my lungs. ""Tell the Council to fix the containment!"" Finn barked back. He hadn't slept in three days. He was a prisoner of the physics he served.

I looked up at the gantry. Sloane, Lead Theorist, was there. Her tablet glowed with real-time telemetry. To her, Finn’s ruined stock wasn't a tragedy; it was a data point. She didn't check if I was hurt; she checked the curve on her screen. 

Above her, a bio-mimetic drone shaped like a crow banked sharply. Its optical sensors locked onto my thermal signature, its red iris flickering in sync with the Spire’s central clock.

The maintenance logs show forty-two similar incidents in three hours, yet no repair crews have been dispatched. The stabilization sub-routines are being bypassed manually. 

Aldersyth hadn’t had a human override since autonomy was ratified, and Sloane held the only key to the logic core. This isn't a malfunction; it’s a controlled experiment. 

The floor was drawing 1.2g more than the atmosphere. The city is being pushed to its structural limits to see which materials and which people, snap first.",1,1769341147.0,worldbuilding,1,1.0,False

It all started in June where I caught the stomach flu. I threw up 10 plus times,had diarrhoea and even fainted briefly. Not even a month later I had severe stomach pain, acid reflux and nausea that didn’t go away for 3 days, despite taking vomex (I ate blue sour gummies and after that all the pain etc started).

Some weeks later I went to my doctor and she gave me a prescription for a gut healing powder. It helped and I was starting to feel better and to reintroduce food again, but on the third day of drinking coffee the intense nausea returned again. After that nothing helped anymore and I just cut back on sweets, spicy and acid food and drinks. I felt bad the whole summer and symptoms just kept getting worse and I also started to have diarrhoea. I went to my doctor several times but she said that it was just anxiety bcs I was going to a new school.

The first weeks at my new school (boarding school) weren’t better either. All my symptoms continued and I had to go to the nursery a bunch of times. The doctor there diagnosed me with gastritis and I started to take pantoprazole (iberogast and talcid too) , which helped but still didn’t heal me completely.

Some days before Christmas it all went downhill again and I have stomach pain, acid reflux ,nausea and diarrhoea at least once a week and idk what to do anymore.

The doctor said I should test for lactose and fructose intolerance. Celiac disease was already tested and I don’t have it. She will also test me to see if I have h. pylori, but I’ll have to wait 4 months for all of this bcs they have no appointment before that. Since this is an ongoing issue for months now she said my gastritis is chronic.

And if all that doesn’t work out I’ll have to go to a gastroenterologist, but to get an appointment there is really hard, you often have to wait 7-10 months. I have emetophobia so all of this is extremely hard for me and idk what to do anymore.",1,1769341085.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

Physically I’m peeing fairly normally (normal volumes, no pain/burning), perhaps more often due to my symptoms. The main part is it only seems to happen in stressful situations like meetings or social settings. Today I had to walk out of church only after a few minutes, and as soon as I left I was completely normal again without even needing the toilet.

I recently increased caffeine a lot for work (coffee industry - new job where I need to taste a lot) and have been drinking alcohol more often due to changing house (region), new job, boredom and “to relax”. I’ve cut both back. My GP said it’s likely overactive bladder/irritable urinary symptoms and gave me propranolol to manage my nerves. Tests so far are normal. It feels more emotional or neurological than physical. I bought myself adult incontinence pants as a fail safe too as a way to try to still show up - hyper low moment.

The anxiety about losing control is honestly worse than the bladder symptoms themselves and it’s seriously affecting my work/life. I walk out on meetings I’m meant to be holding, I acted weird on a date and I had to leave work early (and work from home) this week due to the intensity of the issue. I have only been there for 6 weeks. Driving home after I left, all symptoms were gone.

I have blamed my Crohns as it’s easier to explain than these symptoms.

It’s literally come out of nowhere, I didn’t think I was an anxious person before and I have been fine public speaking, leading events/ meetings and come across as an extrovert. This is a powerful experience which is difficult to manage and I fear I could lose my dream job as a result of not being able to show up or stay.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We meet on hinge texted for awhile, she was really cute, funny, ambitious and beautiful, so we decided to go on a date. Date was great, we matched in many things, we talked all the time there was never once awkward silence. She mentioned how pretty I am few times and told me she allways had a thing for femme women with long dark hair and dark eyes, she only joked how I'm missing a few tattoos. After that we kissed and I drove her back home, and we made plans that next weekend I'll come stay with her for two days as we dont live in same city. We texted that week before I came to stay with her everything was perfect, so I get there friday night we talked, watched a movie, drank wine and ended up sleeping together. After that we both showered and she put this black oversized T-shirt on with cool print on the back, and I told her I like it and ask where she got it, she said she don't know that it's her ex girlfriends shirt...

 So next morning we wake up and decide to go for a coffee, she said its 5 minute drive to her favorite coffee place so we drive there. We get there its cozy coffee shop with stars that lead to flats upstairs, it was cute. But 10 minutes after we sat down two woman came downstairs from the flat, one was blonde but other one tall, feminine,  long black hair, dark brown eyes, she wore a crop top and I could see she has tattoos everywhere (colarbones, ribs, spine, stomach, arms...) She honestly was very beautiful woman, so I joke to the girl I'm seeing that this one looks like her type, she stone cold says thats her ex girlfriend. I was like okay so I'm sitting with her in coffee shop where her ex lives upstairs. So those two woman sit down and this girls stares at her ex for five minutes until her ex girlfriend noticed her, smiled and got up and came to introduce herself and say hi. She was sweet, nice, wished us great day and went back to her table. Rest off the weekend went normal so I let it slide, we had fun it was good.

But two days ago she texts me at 8 pm that shes going out, she texts me at 2 am again saying shes waisted so I ask if she wants me to drive to pick her up. She texts me next day at 4 pm saying it was fine, her ex ended up in same club so she took her home.

Now please tell me am I crazy or that would be big red flag to other people to?

Routine keeps life sane, or at least predictable. That Tuesday, she appeared—a stranger with a leather satchel, headphones in, notebook balanced on her knees. Something about the way she stared out the window like she was solving a problem the world hadn’t caught up to made me look twice. I didn’t usually talk to strangers, but the train lurched, she dropped her notebook, and our hands collided reaching for it. Her eyes met mine—green, sharp, curious—and she smiled, brushing it off. “Sorry, clumsy,” she said. That small smile, fleeting, made the next ten stops unbearable. When she got off, I realized I hadn’t even asked her name. The next day, I sat in the same seat, hoping, almost desperately, to see her again. I did—and she was looking at me before I noticed her, notebook open, as if waiting for something I didn’t understand yet.

Days turned into weeks. We exchanged snippets of conversation: favorite books, train delays, office complaints, the weather. The tension between us grew like a quiet hum, electric, unspoken. One morning, the train screeched to a halt. Someone had fainted, chaos spreading quickly, and she reached for me instinctively to steady herself. Our hands touched longer than necessary. I felt heat surge where only polite distance should’ve existed. Later that day, she sent me a message: “Coffee tonight? Not on the train.” My heart skipped. When I arrived at the café, she was already there, scribbling something in her notebook. We talked, laughed, leaned in closer than socially acceptable, and then… her phone buzzed. Her face went pale. I asked what it was. She hesitated, voice low: “It’s my fiancé.” The words hit like a freight train. I froze. She looked at me, torn, eyes glistening. Then she whispered, almost too soft to hear: “I don’t know if I can do this anymore.”

We walk through quiet streets, talking about everything and nothing, always circling the unspoken. She admits the engagement had been comfortable, predictable, suffocating, and meeting me made her realize how little she’d been living for herself. That night, she calls her fiancé. Minutes later, she hangs up, tears and relief on her face—she ended it. Firmly, finally, without hesitation. She turns to me, eyes steady, alive. “I don’t want to go back,” she says. “I want… this. Us.”

Years later, we’re married with two kids, mornings filled with laughter and chaos, evenings with quiet talks and coffee on the porch. She smiles at me across the table, and I still get that same jolt I felt the first time our hands touched.

As for her ex-fiancé? He moved to another city, restarted his life alone, eventually finding someone who matched his predictable ways. He learned the hard way that comfort isn’t love—and some doors, once closed, don’t reopen.

Now I kinda randomly switched again to a vegan diet because of my friends and mainly my brother, who works for the sustainability research department. It's easy to maintain this diet and buy clothes, since Berlin is one of the vegan friendliest cities. Didn't really adjust that much since I don't eat eggs or milk anyway whether I was vegetarian or not. 

It still makes me feel better and connected with my peers, I like to share and cook my vegan recipes, it makes me feel seen to order oatmilk coffee, and especially in Berlin people like you more. Yet I'm only consuming, and I have no capacities to engage in any activism right now because not my origin countries are at war with each other and I focused my energy on that. In general I'd always prioritize the fight against humanitarian crisis and discrimination since I'm directly effected. Yes, it's Whataboutism, yet I'm not planning on changing that. My simple question is:

Am I just a plant based consumer or am I vegan? What is veganism primarily about, the acts or the morals?

Depends on constructive answers, I'd stop calling myself vegan

Coming from 15 years of being more focused on tea (the real stuff - gong fu cha etc) I can confidently say that coffee is a lot less kind and more punishing of errors. So I feel very lucky to have just had a delicious first cup of this coffee, having absent-mindedly grabbed the wrong tin of beans. I'd been expecting to brew an anaerobic natural looking to blend the flavours and limit funk, so very coarse ground (9 on Ode gen2), 85c water, single pour into a closed switch, open at 60s draining to finish 85s. 

Either way, if anyone's living in natural-land and wanting to try a washed that still has a little sweet fruitiness to it, this seems like a great example of a clean washed coffee that's had just a little more fermentation than traditional, and perhaps just a little bit more roast than the average nordic (but still light, lighter than most Skylark for instance).

1qmgi4v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qmgi4v,The Best Value Gordon Ramsay Meal: A Review,"Just tried out an incredible Sunday brunch here at Gordon Ramsay Bar & Grill here in Manila.

Background: With the exception of Street Pizza, all you can eat options are virtually unheard of at Gordon's restaurants. At every Saturday and Sunday, for just USD 50, you can have unlimited hot and cold appetizers, desserts and non-alcoholic drinks (soft drinks, juices, tea and coffee) to go along with the main course of your choice. Some items have an upcharge which I'll explain later. Here are the things I've had which you can follow in the pictures attached.

Bread course: Unusual in the Philippines, the bread offered was hot brioche and it was a great way to start the meal. The bread itself was hot, sweet and buttery that you don't need to apply the butter to enjoy its texture and flavor (which was great to add as well if you're into that).

Appetizers: For me personally, the free flowing appetizers were the highlight of the brunch. The portions are perfectly small enough for you to order seconds (or thirds).

Kale & Quinoa Salad - I'm certainly not into kale and quinoa, but this is a great cold salad starter. The goat cheese accentuated the crunchy kale.

Aged Steak Tartar - I'm always apprehensive about consuming raw beef, but this dish blew my mind. There's no hint of gaminess and the meat was incredibly tender that I felt eating a French pate.

Crab Royale - Hands down, this is probably the best dish of the meal. They didn't skimp on the ingredients on this one. The crab cakes are plump and fresh, the smoked salmon and perfectly poached eggs formed a great combination that could qualify this dish as an entree.

Gordon's Chicken and Waffle - This dish was OK. The fried chicken was crispy, tender and has a very slight kick of the hot honey (I assume most diners couldn't bear more kick). The waffle leans on the savory side and a bit dry though.

Prawn Toast - Just your standard Asian dim sum offering. Nothing too special, the toast itself is crisp and filled with ground shrimp, but I can see this as a bar staple to go along with your drunks.

Bangers and Mash - I was surprised by the use of fried onion rings instead of caramelized onions on this British pub staple, but the sausages are tasty and decently peppery.

Entree: The choices were the signature burger, cauliflower steak, chicken schnitzel and for an upcharge: Sunday roast (add USD 15) and Fish and Chips (add USD 10). The Beef Wellington option (add USD 30) is only available on Saturdays. I'm personally not the biggest fan of those dishes so I stick with the burger.

Pub & Grill Burger - I tried Gordon Ramsay Burger at Lotte World Mall in Seoul and to compare that to this one I've had, this version has a firmer patty but the other components like lettuce, tomato, cheese and sauce are standard. I highly appreciated that the burger was not too greasy at all. The only nitpick I could give was that the bun-burger ratio isn't great and I ended up having a lot of leftover bun. The fries are your typical chips which are lightly salted that I prefer.

Dessert: There are 3 choices and I tried them all:

Sticky Toffee Pudding - To compare the one I had at Bread Street Kitchen, this one is virtually identical which shows Gordon's consistency on this dish. Others find this a bit too sweet but I believed that the sweetness and texture is fine for the meal finale.

Mango Knickerbocker Glory - This is an interesting take on the classic British dessert. The use of mango sorbet allowed to cut the richness of this dessert. I find it to be more like a parfait though.

Manjari Chocolate Tart - The chocolate is insanely rich and decadent. I like my chocolate desserts on the bitter side but this one is a bit too sweet for my liking.

Service - The service was incredibly cordial, professional and efficient despite the crowds and understandably lagging serving times. You need to pace yourself and don't rush to enjoy the meal. The DJ playing all the classic club favorites was a bonus for the relaxing Sunday brunch.

Overall, you can't go wrong with the value of this weekend brunch. It's a perfect way to celebrate a very special occasion that you cannot scream overpriced (just in many of Gordon's restaurants).",10,1769339725.0,GordonRamsay,0,1.0,False

I am a cleaner for some time now and charge a fair rate for my job. I think I do my job well, never have any complaints about cleanliness. I rarely take days off and I'm pretty much never sick. 
I have many customers, and never had issues with times. Usually when I finished 10-15mins earlier the customers still paid for the full time they booked in for as even though it took me a little less time, I still did all my jobs and usually picked up on other bits too, so I cleaned basically more than even asked for. Now I've been asked to drop the booking time by 15mins because a couple of times I finished and left earlier. But I don't feel that it is fair as I still do my job + other extra bits already. I feel that I found my way round the house and due to that I am faster at cleaning it plus it's kept on top of. But I still do the whole house every time. So it makes me feel, that because I am time efficient, I'm being penalised for it in a way? If the house would be left for a month, I'd then have to catch up and it would probably take me a while longer to accomplish. I might be wrong here thinking like I am the victim, but people who work from home take longer breaks, make coffee, lunch etc and are still paid for full day of work as long as they finish their tasks within the time. So how is that different to my situation? I don't take breaks while cleaning, only in between houses. I just need some other people's opinion and perspective.

For context: I’m using 1Zpresso J-Ultra, which I like a lot, but a family member recently got into coffee after seeing my setup. Hand grinding isn’t a good fit for them in terms of workflow and effort.

Their expected budget is around \~$100. If this were my own purchase, I’d go higher — but for a beginner, I want to play it safe before suggesting a larger investment.

Use case:

\- Espresso only (with the Go)

\- Beginner-friendly and low-fuss

\- Electric grinder

\- Doesn’t need to be endgame — just usable and reasonably consistent

I’m aware that \~$100 is very tight for espresso grinders. That said, I’m specifically looking for practical options or compromises at this level:

\- Used models that are known to work

\- Entry-level grinders that can be made to work for espresso

\- Or a realistic minimum price point where things noticeably improve

MBTI stands for Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. It is a system that categorizes personality into sixteen types. The types are based on four pairs of preferences. These pairs include introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, and judging or perceiving. People usually learn about MBTI through online questionnaires. The questions ask about everyday preferences, habits, and reactions.

Many organizations use MBTI for training or team discussions. It is sometimes used in schools, offices, and workshops. The results are often presented as neutral descriptions. Each type has strengths and weaknesses. The descriptions are meant to be informative rather than predictive. MBTI does not measure intelligence or skill level.

Some people read about their type and find it accurate. Others think it is too general. Researchers often debate its scientific validity. Critics say the categories are too rigid. Supporters say it helps with self-reflection and communication. MBTI is not considered a diagnostic tool.

The system was developed in the twentieth century. It was influenced by Carl Jung’s theories. Over time, it became popular in mainstream culture. Many books and websites explain the types in detail. Charts and tables are commonly used to summarize traits.

In daily conversation, MBTI is sometimes used as shorthand. People may mention their type casually. This can lead to simple discussions about preferences. Overall, MBTI is a structured framework for talking about personality. It continues to be used despite ongoing debate about its accuracy.

It is generally presented in reports, presentations, and summaries. The language remains neutral. The goal is clarity rather than excitement, and the topic is treated as informational material in professional and educational contexts.",1,1769339277.0,MbtiTypeMe,4,1.0,False

What even was this,"So at about 8 years old i kept having a recurring dream of walking across the house to my mom's room but it would always end just as i got to the door. So one night just being a kid before going to sleep i wished to myself to go beyond that. The same dream did occur but i woke up right at the end point so i decided get out of bed and psychically walk to my mother's room. Once i walked in i could see a man about a foot tall on the floor wearing a like ball and chain around one leg. Wasn't a shadow just a person clear as day. I approached and reached my hand out with my entire body freezing unable to move after getting close it simply walked away. Going under my mom's bed, i then was back to being able to move i followed and lowered my head to look under. All i could see were 2 glowing yellow eyes looking back at me. I freaked out, jumped onto my mom's bed causing her to wake up she's reassuring me that there's nothing. A few minutes later i then see the person floating around the ceiling until eventually a old round mirror appears floating above my mom's bedroom doorway seemingly held by something that looks like a fairy. The tiny person floats into it and disappears. The next night before bed i wished to myself that would never happen again. My mom can recollect when i ask her about it and she she's stated when a little younger than that she would find me in the morning sleeping under the dining room table or coffee table. Gives me goosebumps to think about what had happened and I've got no idea. Thanks if you made it this far ",4,1769338963.0,ParanormalEncounters,2,0.84,False

1qmg9if,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1qmg9if/how_to_be_the_most_charming_person_in_the_room/,How to Be the MOST CHARMING Person in the Room: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Okay, real talk. I spent way too much time researching this because I was tired of watching less interesting people command entire rooms while I stood there like a potted plant. And honestly? The stuff that actually works isn't what you'd expect.

Most people think charm is about being the loudest or funniest person. It's not. After diving deep into social psychology research, communication studies, and way too many hours of Charisma on Command videos, I realized charm is actually a skill you can learn. It's about making others feel something specific when they're around you.

Here's what actually moves the needle:

Make people feel like they're the only person in the room. This sounds simple but it's wildly powerful. When someone's talking to you, put your phone away. Face them fully. Don't let your eyes dart around looking for someone more interesting. Research from UCLA's social cognitive neuroscience lab shows that feeling seen activates the same reward centers in the brain as receiving money. When you give someone your full attention, you're literally giving their brain a dopamine hit. I started practicing this at coffee shops, just forcing myself to maintain eye contact and actually listen instead of planning what I'd say next. The shift in how people responded was insane.

Ask questions that make people think. Instead of what do you do?, try what's been keeping you busy lately? or what's something you're excited about right now?. The goal is to give people permission to talk about what they actually care about, not just recite their job title for the millionth time. Conversational expert Celeste Headlee talks about this in her book We Need to Talk: How to Have Conversations That Matter. She's a journalist who's conducted thousands of interviews and the core insight is this: good conversations aren't about you. They're about making the other person feel interesting. This book completely changed how I approach social situations. Instead of trying to be impressive, I started trying to be impressed. Way less exhausting, way more effective.

Use people's names. Dale Carnegie covered this in How to Win Friends and Influence People decades ago but it still hits. A person's name is the sweetest sound to them. Use it naturally in conversation. That's a great point, Sarah or I never thought about it that way, Marcus. It creates instant familiarity and makes people feel valued. Carnegie's book is ancient but it's based on fundamental human psychology that hasn't changed. Won the Pulitzer, sold 30 million copies, and honestly deserves the hype. I was skeptical because it's so old but the principles are weirdly timeless. This book will make you question everything you think you know about social dynamics.

Master the art of the callback. Remember something someone mentioned earlier and bring it back up later. Hey, how did that presentation go? or Did you end up trying that restaurant?. It signals that you were actually listening and that they matter enough for you to remember. This is basic but so few people do it. I started keeping mental notes during conversations and following up, even in the same evening. The impact is disproportionate to the effort.

Be genuinely curious about weird details. When someone mentions something obscure, lean into it. They collect vintage typewriters? Ask what makes one typewriter better than another. They're really into fermentation? Ask what the weirdest thing they've fermented is. Curiosity is magnetic. And here's the thing, you're not faking it. There's something interesting about literally everything if you dig even slightly below the surface.

Don't one,up stories. This is huge. Someone shares something cool that happened to them, your job is NOT to immediately share your cooler story. Just appreciate theirs. Say that's incredible or I would've lost my mind. Psychologist Guy Winch talks about this in his podcast Dear Therapists. He breaks down how trying to relate by sharing your own story often backfires because it shifts focus away from the other person. The podcast is cohosted with Lori Gottlieb and they analyze real relationship dynamics. Super insightful for understanding why we do the annoying things we do in social situations.

If you want something more structured to actually internalize these patterns, there's also BeFreed, an AI,powered learning app that pulls from psychology books, communication research, and expert interviews to create personalized audio lessons. You type in a goal like become more magnetic in conversations and it generates a tailored learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10,minute summaries to 40,minute deep dives. The depth control is clutch when you want specifics on things like active listening techniques or handling social anxiety. You can even pick different voices, I went with the sarcastic one because why not make learning about charm actually entertaining. It connects dots between books like the ones mentioned here and real,world applications, which helped me move from theory to actually doing this stuff at parties.

Become comfortable with silence. Charming people don't fill every gap with noise. They let conversations breathe. Silence gives the other person space to think and share something deeper. I used to panic and word vomit during any pause. Now I just smile and wait. More often than not, people fill that space with the most interesting thing they've said all night.

Smile with your eyes. A real smile activates the muscles around your eyes, not just your mouth. People can spot a fake smile instantly, even if they don't consciously realize it. Research in emotional intelligence shows that genuine positive emotion is contagious. If you're actually happy to be talking to someone, it shows. And if you're not? Fake it til you become it. Amy Cuddy's research on power poses applies here too, your behavior shapes your emotions, not just the other way around.

Give specific compliments. You're cool means nothing. The way you explained that concept made it click for me instantly or Your energy when you talk about your work is contagious actually lands. Specific compliments show you're paying attention and they feel earned, not obligatory.

The real secret? Charm isn't about being impressive. It's about being interested. It's not about what you say, it's about how you make people feel. And that's actually great news because it means you don't need to be naturally witty or hilarious or born with it. You just need to care enough to pay attention.

People won't remember every word you said. But they'll remember that talking to you felt good.

Now.. this may not stay forever and I can’t really say that I’m okay now (hives kinda know to come back everytime you say you are finally free) but..

I had a last shot at going to a specialist and after 5 years of going to doctors and thinking everything is bullshit.. she told me to go and do a test for helicobacter pylori. Sure thing, it came out positive.

They perscribed antibiotics and I was kind of hesitant to take them for 2-3 weeks and wanted to try to get rid of it naturally. But at the end I decided to take them as the success rate of doing it naturally is way worse, and I got no time to wait since I’m living in agony. After 3-4 days of starting treatment, hives completely dissapeared. After 5 years my gut finally doesn’t feel irritated by different foods and things like coffee. It’s crazy. 

It’s been 8 days after treatment and although I thought that maybe the one antibiotic (which has antiinflammatory effects) is just suppressing the inflammation and hives and thought it will come back after stopping them, they still haven’t appeared.

I know that there’s a shit ton of causes for this but it may be this bacteria for you too. Go get tested for this. You got nothing to lose, right?

The brain fog followed but all the GP’s said it’s just anxiety and gave me anti-depressants. I have tried CBT-I and supplements such as CBD oil and magnesium but they don’t work. The anti-depressants made no different either

I raised the topic with GP’s on whether this is hormone related and been told ‘too young’ and one said it was impossible to be perimenopause at my age at 42 😳

In the past six months other symptoms have developed such as burning and sweating and migraines and heart palpitations. The Insomnja is the worst, I had to quit my job as couldn’t function of 2 hours sleep a night.

I managed to get some zopiclone through somewhere. They won’t prescribe me sleep pills just anti-depressants, but also won’t prescribe me HRT so feeling a bit stuck. 

Since then I have changed birth control pill to zoely as it has HRT oestrogen but it’s making no different to helping my symptoms. I was already on a combined pill for 20 years and it was another reason GP’s dismissed me as they said it should combat the symptoms. 

Has anyone had any relief from HRT for Insomnia? 

I know it might not work for all but I am wanting to try it to get some sort of normality back in my life again. It’s just a battle to get any GP to prescribe me instead of telling me to stop drinking coffee and practice sleep hygiene.

It’s mostly setting up chairs, making coffee, helping people figure out phones that they absolutely refuse to replace.

One evening, I was asked to help clear out a storage room. Nothing urgent—just boxes that hadn’t been touched in years.

Most of it was junk. Old board games. Holiday decorations. A karaoke machine that looked like it had survived a war.

At the bottom of a plastic bin, I found a single laminated sheet of paper.

It was titled:

Instructions for Room Use (After Hours)

I assumed it was for staff, but it wasn’t posted anywhere. No logo. No date.

Just a list.

Turn off the main lights. Leave the desk lamp on.

Do not sit in the red chair.

If you hear someone testing the microphone, do not respond.

At 8:40 p.m., check the clock. If it reads 8:41, leave immediately.

I laughed. Genuinely.

Someone’s idea of a prank, probably.

I showed it to the coordinator. She frowned—not confused, just… tired.

“That’s old,” she said. “You can throw it away.”

“Old how?”

She paused, then shrugged. “Before my time.”

That night, I stayed late helping clean the main hall. Everyone else left around 8:15. I remembered the sheet and smiled to myself. Creepy list, creepy font, very internet-core.

At 8:39, I checked my phone.

8:39.

I looked up at the wall clock.

8:40.

The desk lamp was already on. I hadn’t noticed turning the main lights off.

The red chair—one of those padded folding chairs—sat alone near the back wall. I don’t remember putting it there.

At 8:40, the PA system clicked.

Just once.

A soft thump, like someone tapping a microphone to see if it was on.

I didn’t say anything.

Mostly because I suddenly felt very aware of how quiet the building was.

I checked the clock again.

8:41.

I left.

No sprinting. No panic. Just a calm, overwhelming sense that staying would be rude somehow.

The next week, I went back. The storage room had been reorganized. The bin was gone.

I asked the coordinator about it. She smiled politely.

“Oh, we don’t use that room after hours anymore,” she said. “People kept not following instructions.”

“What instructions?”

She looked at me for a long second.

Then said, “You did, though. That’s good.”

I still volunteer there.

But I never stay past 8:30.

The United States government is preparing to invest $1.6 billion in Oklahoma-based miner USA Rare Earth, securing a 10% ownership stake as part of a broader strategy to strengthen domestic production of critical minerals and reduce reliance on China, according to a report by the Financial Times citing people familiar with the matter. The government funding, alongside a separate $1 billion private financing round, is expected to be officially announced on Monday.

Under the proposed agreement, the U.S. government would receive 16.1 million shares in USA Rare Earth, along with warrants for an additional 17.6 million shares, both priced at $17.17 per share. This move follows a series of similar actions by Washington, which last year took equity stakes in MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals as part of its effort to secure supply chains for minerals vital to national defense, semiconductors, electric vehicles, and advanced manufacturing.

Officials have emphasized that the USA Rare Earth deal is focused on onshoring critical and strategic minerals essential to U.S. national security and the semiconductor supply chain. The investment reportedly involves the U.S. Commerce Department’s CHIPS office, which oversees incentives aimed at expanding domestic manufacturing capacity and reducing geopolitical risk tied to overseas supply dependencies.

USA Rare Earth is currently developing a rare earths mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas, and a neodymium magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The magnet plant is expected to begin commercial operations in the first half of 2026, positioning the company as one of the largest U.S.-based producers of neo magnets, a key component used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and defense systems. The company’s market capitalization currently stands at approximately $3.45 billion.

To support further expansion, USA Rare Earth has engaged Cantor Fitzgerald to lead efforts to raise more than $1 billion in additional equity financing. Neither the White House nor USA Rare Earth has commented publicly on the report, and Reuters noted it was unable to independently verify the details. However, the deal underscores Washington’s growing commitment to rebuilding domestic mineral supply chains and countering China’s dominance in rare earths production.

WASHINGTON, Jan 25 — The Trump administration is taking a 10 per cent stake in USA Rare Earth as part of a US$1.6 billion (RM6.41 billion) debt-and-equity investment package aimed at helping the company develop a domestic mine and magnet facility, two sources familiar with the deal told Reuters.

The deal and a separate US$1 billion (RM4.01 billion) private investment will be unveiled on Monday and Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth will host a morning conference call with investors to discuss the terms, according to one of the sources who was briefed on the plans.

The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. USA Rare Earth declined to comment.

China is the largest global processor of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals used to make a range of electronics and military equipment. The US  produces only small volumes of rare earths, which has sparked a push in recent years from Washington to increase output.

USA Rare Earth has been developing a mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas, with Texas Mineral Resources that is slated to open by 2028 and has a magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma, that is expected to launch later this year.

***As part of the USA Rare Earth investment, Washington will receive 16.1 million shares in the company along with warrants for an additional 17.6 million shares, according to the sources.*** 

Both would be priced at US$17.17 (RM68.77) a share, near where the company’s stock traded earlier this month.

The *Financial Times* was first to report on the investment.

The deal is the latest move by the Trump administration to move into the critical minerals space after taking equity stakes last year in MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals.

***A senior Trump official said last month that the administration was planning more “historic deals” with the U.S. mining sector to increase production of lithium, rare earths and other critical minerals used in national defense, artificial intelligence and other related areas.***

USA Rare Earth has hired Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm chaired by Brandon Lutnick, the son of US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, to help with fundraising efforts, one of the sources said. — Reuters

**🚨 Trump Admin Just Took a 10% Equity Stake in USA Rare Earth — And It Quietly Validates the Entire NioCorp Thesis**

Today’s Reuters report that the U.S. government is taking a **$1.6B debt-and-equity stake for 10% of USA Rare Earth** is not just another funding headline — it’s a policy signal. Washington is no longer just “supporting” critical minerals. It is now **directly taking ownership stakes** in strategic suppliers tied to defense, AI, aerospace, and industrial security. That matters, because it reframes how projects like NioCorp should be viewed: not as speculative juniors, but as potential strategic infrastructure.

The market still prices NioCorp as if it’s a conventional mine-in-permitting. That framing is outdated. What’s forming around Elk Creek is a vertically aligned critical materials platform synced with national priorities. Pentagon funding is already in. EXIM financing discussions are real. The new assays strengthened the resource. DFS update is pending. And the output profile — **Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, magnet REEs** — maps almost perfectly onto the materials list the federal government is actively trying to onshore. ***The policy environment is now proving that Washington will step in directly when supply chains matter.***

***Where this gets truly disruptive is SCANDIUM imho! For decades, the aerospace and defense industry has been stuck in a deadlock:***

[The \\""chicken-and-egg problem froze the entire sector.\\"" NioCorp just broke it!!!](https://reddit.com/link/1qmg54o/video/rev48hxx6hfg1/player)

* ***“We can’t design with Sc-Al alloys without reliable supply.”***
* ***“We can’t build supply without guaranteed demand.”***
* ***That chicken-and-egg problem froze the entire sector. NioCorp just broke it!!!***
* ***With the launch of NAMA, the acquisition of FEA’s IP, work on scandium-aluminum master alloys, and engagement with defense-adjacent partners,***
* ***NioCorp is no longer positioning itself as a seller of oxide — but as a producer of engineered materials. That moves them up the value chain into margins, lock-in, and strategic relevance.***

This is also why comparing NioCorp to MP Materials is both wrong — and still bullish. MP trades as a strategic asset largely on magnet REEs. NioCorp potentially brings **Niobium for steel and armor, Scandium for aerospace alloys and AM, Titanium for alloys & structural systems, and REEs for magnets**, plus downstream integration. That’s not a single-commodity story. That’s a multi-vertical critical materials platform aligned with defense, infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and national resilience.

**So how does today’s USA Rare Earth deal connect directly to NioCorp? Simple: it establishes precedent.** If the U.S. government is now willing to take equity stakes in companies securing domestic critical materials and manufacturing capacity, then projects like Elk Creek become **strategic candidates, not just financing candidates**. ***It increases the probability of federal participation, de-risks long-term funding, strengthens the negotiating position with partners, and raises the odds that NioCorp eventually gets viewed the same way: not as a stock — but as infrastructure!***

The conclusion isn’t hype, it’s structural logic. Strategic alignment + vertical integration + federal interest + critical scarcity doesn’t stay mispriced forever. Repricing doesn’t happen because Reddit gets excited. It happens when reality becomes unavoidable. **And if Elk Creek executes anywhere near management’s trajectory, NioCorp doesn’t just become a successful miner — it becomes a cornerstone of U.S. advanced materials independence!**

**This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions —** they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

[\\""ALL ABOARD!\\"" \~ As NioCorp isn’t building just a mine — it’s building the strategic materials backbone of U.S. defense and advanced manufacturing, with scandium, niobium, titanium, rare earths, and vertical ScAl alloy integration positioning it as the closest thing America has to a Saudi Arabia of critical minerals.](https://reddit.com/link/1qmg54o/video/np9wejg77hfg1/player)

***IMHO\~ This wasn’t a one-off deal — it was a warning shot that Washington is about to start hand-picking winners in critical minerals, and companies already aligned with defense, AI, and domestic supply chains (like NioCorp) are standing exactly where the spotlight is about to land.*** 

If you’re still on the sidelines, just understand this: when the U.S. government starts taking equity stakes in critical minerals, the easy money is usually gone by the time everyone else finally notices. ...

Here's what nobody tells you: some friendships have expiration dates, and that's okay. We talk endlessly about romantic breakups but friendship breakups? Total silence. Yet they can hurt just as much, sometimes worse.

The truth is, we're not taught how to navigate this. Society pushes this narrative that good friends are forever, which makes letting go feel like personal failure. But research shows that most friendships naturally fade as we evolve. The problem isn't the ending itself but recognizing when holding on does more harm than good.

**You constantly feel drained after hanging out.** Genuine friendships should energize you, not leave you emotionally exhausted. Dr. Marisa Franco talks about this extensively in her book Platonic: How the Science of Attachment Can Help You Make and Keep Friends. She's a psychologist who basically decoded friendship psychology, and this book destroyed everything I thought I knew about maintaining relationships. The core idea? Friendships thrive on reciprocal energy exchange. When you're always the one initiating plans, emotional support flows one direction only, or you need three days to recover from a coffee date, your nervous system is screaming at you. Franco explains how our bodies physically respond to relationship imbalances through stress hormones. That exhaustion isn't weakness, it's data. Your friendship shouldn't feel like unpaid emotional labor.

**They dismiss your growth or new interests.** Real friends celebrate your evolution. When someone consistently mocks your new hobby, makes you feel stupid for learning something, or acts threatened by your success, that's not friendship. That's insecurity weaponized. Psychology researcher Dr. Shasta Nelson identifies this pattern in friendship dissolution studies. She found that friendships often fracture when one person grows and the other resists change. It shows up as subtle digs about your ""new personality"" or jokes that cut deeper than they should. Check out Nelson's work on friendship stages, she breaks down how healthy friendships adapt versus how toxic ones calcify.

**You're different people around them versus everyone else.** Notice if you censor yourself constantly or perform a outdated version of who you used to be. Maybe you were the ""party friend"" five years ago and now you're into fitness and reading, but they keep dragging you back to old patterns. The Huberman Lab podcast did an entire episode on identity and social bonds. Dr. Andrew Huberman explains how our brains literally wire differently based on repeated social interactions. When a friendship forces you to suppress core parts of yourself, you're creating neural pathways of inauthenticity. That's not sustainable, and it's definitely not healthy.

**Major value misalignments keep surfacing.** I'm not talking about pizza toppings. I mean fundamental ethics, how they treat service workers, their integrity when nobody's watching. You can't force alignment on things that matter deeply to your sense of right and wrong. Clinical psychologist Dr. Ramani Durvasula discusses this in her research on toxic relationships. While she focuses mainly on narcissistic dynamics, her framework applies to friendships too. When someone repeatedly crosses your boundaries or behaves in ways that violate your core values, you're not being judgmental for walking away. You're being honest.

**The friendship exists purely on nostalgia.** ""We've been friends since high school"" isn't a good enough reason to maintain a relationship that no longer serves either of you. Shared history matters, but it can't be the only foundation. Esther Perel talks about this concept in her work on relationships, how we sometimes confuse loyalty with obligation. The friendship needs to work NOW, in present tense, with who you both currently are. Otherwise you're just museum curators of a relationship that died years ago.

**You fantasize about distance.** When you feel relief instead of disappointment that plans got cancelled, when you hope they don't text back, when you imagine how much lighter life would feel without them in it, listen to that. Your intuition is trying to tell you something. The app Reflectly can actually help you track these patterns through journaling prompts. It uses AI to identify emotional trends you might miss consciously.

There's also BeFreed, an AI learning app that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio content based on what you're dealing with. If you're struggling with letting go of toxic friendships, you can tell it your specific situation and it'll generate a tailored learning plan with actionable strategies from sources like the books mentioned above. You control the depth, from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are genuinely great, I've been using the calm, thoughtful one for heavier topics. It's helped me understand patterns in my own relationships that I couldn't see before.

Letting go doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you someone who values authentic connection over comfortable familiarity. Sometimes the most loving thing you can do is release someone whose chapter in your story has ended. That doesn't erase what you shared, it just honors that people change, paths diverge, and that's human.

Not every friendship is meant to last forever, and trying to force it just leaves everyone diminished. You're allowed to outgrow people. You're allowed to choose yourself.",2,1769338419.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False
1qmg3in,https://i.redd.it/h5g1u7257hfg1.jpeg,Three Days to End My Marriage,"The elite of Houston all knew that the second son of the Crawford family, Merrick Crawford, had offered an astonishing 1.6 billion dollars to marry his girlfriend, Priscilla Burnett.
On what should have been her wedding night, Priscilla, expecting to see the man she loved, found herself facing his older brother instead—Garrett Crawford, who had been confined to a wheelchair for six years.
Five years passed. Priscilla drowned in the sea while trying to recover a lost ring for Garrett.
In her final moments, the Grim Reaper told her, ""Your marriage was never consummated. The path ahead is closed to you. Sever the tie within three days. After that, you may proceed.""
\*\*\*
Priscilla returned to the Crawford's villa, her body battered and soaked through.
She clutched a diamond ring tightly in her hand.
Entering her room, she saw her husband, Garrett, seated in his wheelchair, dressed in a finely tailored dark suit.
He ignored her disheveled appearance, his voice cool as he inquired, ""Did you find it?""
Priscilla handed him the ring.
""Don't lose it again.""
She couldn't go searching for him anymore.
A flicker of something unrecognizable passed through Garrett's eyes at the sight of the ring, yet his words were curt. ""You were slow.
""Go kneel in the chapel.""
Priscilla was accustomed to his mercurial temperament. She simply fetched a blanket and carefully draped it over his legs.
""All right. I'll go in a moment.
""It's getting colder now. Don't catch a cold when you go out.""
A car accident eleven years ago had damaged Garrett's legs, abruptly ending the promising future of the family's golden boy and leaving him wheelchair-bound.
His health had never fully recovered, leaving him vulnerable to illness.
Her concern drew a scornful laugh from him. ""Five years of this charade. Doesn't it wear on you?
""It's my brother you love, yet you play the devoted wife for the world to see.
""It's disgusting.""
Priscilla wasn't angry. ""You should rest. I'm going to the chapel.""
She turned and left without another word.
Watching her slender, retreating figure, Garrett finally registered that she was soaked through.
He frowned slightly and summoned a maid. ""Have the floors cleaned wherever she walked.""
His gaze fell to the blanket on his lap.
""And dispose of this.""
\*\*\*
On her knees in the Crawford family's small chapel, Priscilla felt cold to her core. Her eyes were fixed on the somber pictures of the family's ancestors.
""So it was true. There is an afterlife,"" she thought.
She had drowned while searching the sea for Garrett's ring. The Grim Reaper told her, ""Your marriage was never consummated. The path ahead is closed to you.
""Sever the tie within three days. After that, you may proceed.""
Her options were stark: consummate her marriage with Garrett or divorce him. Only then would her soul find rest.
But Garrett felt nothing for her but disgust. Affection was out of the question.
Five years ago, the Burnett family was drowning in debt, pursued relentlessly by creditors.
Then Merrick—Garrett's younger brother, and also a celebrated racing driver—had arrived with an offer: 1.6 billion dollars for her hand.
On her wedding night, the deception was revealed.
The man waiting was not Merrick, her boyfriend of three months, but his older brother, Garrett, who had lived with paralysis for six years.
Garrett's hatred for her was rooted in her past romantic relationship with Merrick.
When Priscilla sought a divorce from the Crawford family, Merrick warned, ""Divorce Rett if you wish. Just return the 1.6 billion dollars.""
But her mother and brother had already used the money to settle their debts. Repayment was impossible.
Seeing her helplessness, Merrick had laid down her new duty.
""You're part of the family now. Your role is to care for Rett.
""Our family will manage the Burnett family's affairs.""
For her family's survival, she forced down her bitterness about the deception. Tending to Garrett became her duty—the only way to settle the immense financial obligation of 1.6 billion dollars.
Somewhere along the way, her feelings for Garrett had begun to change...
Just then, a maid's voice carried from the hallway.
""Welcome home, Mr. Merrick.""
Merrick's voice, tinged with happiness, followed. ""Mm.
""Cara and I are to be married soon. Replace all the flowers with the roses she loves.""
Caroline Murphy was the cherished heiress of the powerful Murphy Group.
She was not only Merrick's fiancée, but also Garrett's ex-girlfriend.
Chapter 2
The staff murmured their assent.
Once Merrick was gone, their hushed conversations resumed.
""Caroline is a piece of work. Engaged to marry Mr. Garrett, then she breaks it off after his accident.
""She's set to marry Mr. Merrick.
""Both brothers fell for her...""
Someone sighed softly. ""Poor Priscilla.
""I heard Mr. Garrett made her search for a ring—the very one he used to propose to Caroline.""
A sharp pang shot through Priscilla's heart when she heard their conversation.
She had long known that Garrett's true love was Caroline, and she knew the profound significance that ring held for him.
That was precisely why she had risked her life to retrieve it for him, never imagining it would cost her own.
Priscilla knelt in the cold chapel all night. Soaked through, she felt no chill.
Early the next morning, she rose stiffly.
It took her a long moment to steady herself before she could walk, trembling, out of the chapel.
Once outside, she saw her mother, Monica Burnett, standing in the courtyard as if she had been waiting.
""Mom, what brings you here?""
Seeing her daughter's disheveled hair and wrinkled, soaked clothes, Monica frowned.
""You look nothing like a young lady of the Crawford family.""
Priscilla lowered her gaze and explained, ""I searched for a ring for Rett yesterday and accidentally fell into the sea...""
She wanted to tell her mother about her own death, but Monica cut her off.
""I came today because I need your help with your brother.
""His investments failed again. We've already mortgaged the family company. You must ask Rett for help.""
Priscilla hesitated before finally voicing the thought that had taken root.
""Mom, I want a divorce from Garrett.""
Monica stared at her, momentarily speechless.
Then her expression hardened. ""Don't be absurd!
""A divorced woman? Who would marry you then?
""And what would become of our family without the Crawford family?""
Priscilla's heart constricted. ""What if I said I'm dying, Mom?""
Monica dismissed the notion outright.
""If you die, you die as his wife!""
Then, with a final statement, she turned and walked away.
""I have to go. Remember what I said about helping your brother.""
Priscilla stood for a long time, watching her mother leave, before finally returning to her room.
Once there, she took a hot shower.
Even immersed in the steaming water, she felt no warmth.
Her blood no longer flowed, her skin deathly pale. She applied heavy rouge after bathing to make her look normal.
When she was finished, she retrieved the document from a drawer—prepared long ago for this moment.
She made her way to the study.
Garrett was seated behind the desk, reviewing documents.
He glanced up as she entered. ""Here to ask for more money for your brother, I suppose.""
Priscilla was momentarily speechless.
Before she could respond, he continued, his voice laced with scorn, ""Tell me, did I marry you, or your entire family?""
Steeling herself, Priscilla explained, ""You're mistaken. I need you to sign a document.""
She placed it gently on the desk before him.
Garrett's gaze fell upon the bold text printed on the cover: Divorce Agreement.
Chapter 3
A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes. In five years of marriage, this was only the second time Priscilla had mentioned divorce.
The first time, she couldn't produce the 1.6 billion dollars, so she had to let it go.
Now she dared to bring it up again.
Garrett couldn't help a cold laugh. ""Using divorce to threaten me for money?""
Without waiting for her reply, he tossed the divorce agreement into the wastebasket.
""You chose to marry a cripple for money. Now you get to live with that choice for the rest of your life.
""Get out.""
Priscilla instinctively took a few steps back. When Garrett was angry, he refused to listen to anything.
Discussing divorce was impossible now.
""We'll talk when you've calmed down,"" she said.
With that, she turned and left.
Leaving the study, Priscilla quietly closed the door behind her, only to turn and bump into a solid chest.
She looked up and saw Merrick's defiantly handsome face.
Dressed in his red-and-white racing suit, Merrick instinctively took a step back, putting distance between them.
""Priscilla.""
Priscilla was about to respond when she noticed Caroline standing behind him, wrapped in a crimson coat.
She was radiant. With her impeccable makeup and rare, high-end jewelry, Caroline carried herself with elegance and wealth.
""Ms. Burnett, it's been a while.
""You look terribly worn out.""
Her eyes swept over Priscilla, filled with pity.
In the past five years, Priscilla and Caroline had crossed paths many times, but Caroline never addressed her as ""Mrs. Crawford"", always sticking to ""Ms. Burnett"".
""I haven't been sleeping well lately,"" Priscilla replied calmly.
""I have things to attend to. Excuse me.""
She hadn't gone far when Caroline's voice, faint yet clear, carried from behind. ""Don't forget, she became Rett's wife through a transaction you facilitated.
""But she looks so pitiful...""
Their voices gradually faded away.
A self-mocking smile touched Priscilla's lips as she continued toward the main living room.
Upon entering, she saw her mother-in-law, Chloe Crawford.
In an elegant dark dress, she was trimming rose stems and arranging them in a vase.
Chloe's expression cooled the moment she noticed Priscilla.
""Cara and Rick will discuss their wedding plans over lunch today. As the eldest daughter-in-law of this family, must you present yourself like this?
""You're deathly pale. Who are you trying to impress?""
Without waiting for a response, Chloe looked at Priscilla's flat stomach.
""Five years, and still no sign of a child. Did we spend 1.6 billion dollars to bring a decorative piece into this house?""
A bitter taste rose in Priscilla's throat.
""Chloe, the truth is, Rett and I have never been intimate in these five years.""
Chloe was visibly startled, her words catching in her throat.
""Could it be that Rett is...""
Priscilla understood her mother-in-law's unspoken suspicion and shook her head.
""Rett is perfectly healthy. He simply doesn't want me.""
She continued, ""Chloe, I want to divorce him. Can you help me?""
Chloe's brow furrowed deeply as she studied Priscilla.
The woman looked ghostly pale and frighteningly thin, as if a strong gust could topple her—hardly the picture of a woman fit for motherhood.
Yet she seemed skeptical. ""Do you truly wish to divorce Rett? Your family would actually give up the Crawford family's backing?""
Priscilla nodded.
""You're a woman too. You must understand what it's like to live as a wife in name only for five years.""
The moment the words left her mouth, Chloe laughed.
""Who would have thought that behind that gentle, virtuous facade, you're so desperate.
""If you're that desperate for a man, fine. I agree. I'll see to it that you get your divorce.""
Priscilla ignored the scorn in her mother-in-law's words, relieved only by the promise.
This lifetime had brought her only misery.
Once she divorced Garrett, she could finally find peace.
Chapter 4
Soon, the luncheon began.
It was then that Priscilla fully understood the stark difference between people.
She, the so-called eldest daughter-in-law of the Crawford family, and Caroline, the soon-to-be second daughter-in-law, were treated worlds apart.
Seated beside Garrett, Priscilla watched as Chloe—who never did any domestic chores—personally sliced fruit for Caroline.
She watched as her father-in-law, who had seldom spoken to her in five years, instructed the staff to place all of Caroline's favorite dishes before her.
Merrick peeled shrimps for Caroline.
Even Garrett's gaze remained fixed on Caroline throughout.
For the first time, Priscilla learned what it truly meant to be a cherished daughter-in-law in the Crawford family.
The agonizing luncheon finally ended two hours later.
As usual, Priscilla wheeled Garrett to his study for a video conference with the Crawford Group's senior executives.
Once in the study, as she helped him transfer from his wheelchair, his hand accidentally brushed against hers.
He paused.
""Your hands are freezing.""
Priscilla was momentarily taken aback. ""I guess what I'm wearing isn't thick enough.""
At her words, Garrett withdrew his hand, his usual detached manner returning instantly.
""My meeting is about to start. You may go.""
""Alright.""
Priscilla turned and left the room.
Garrett disliked being interrupted while working. As always, she waited outside the door, staring out at the snow that had begun falling quietly at some point.
Though she barely felt the chill, she instinctively wrapped her clothes a little tighter.
For a moment just now, she had almost believed Garrett was showing concern for her.
Suddenly, laughter drifted up to her.
She glanced out the window.
Down below, Caroline had her arm through Merrick's, the two of them admiring the snowfall.
""Rick, enjoying the first snowfall with you at your home means we're meant to grow old together,"" Caroline said.
Merrick had always been cavalier, yet this simple statement brought a deep blush that crept from his ears to his neck.
""We will,"" he answered, his voice uncharacteristically shy.
Priscilla had never seen Merrick blush before.
Five years ago, before she married Garrett, Merrick had pursued her with relentless intensity.
He'd skipped a major race he'd trained six months for, just to go shopping with her.
He'd confessed his feelings for her on live television after winning a championship.
Sweet words flowed effortlessly from him when they were together.
But he'd never blushed.
It seemed a man only grew truly shy around the woman he genuinely loved.
Just then, Caroline's voice pulled Priscilla from her thoughts.
""But I'm feeling a bit nervous.
""Priscilla is so capable. I worry I won't live up to that, and you'll all slowly start to dislike me.""
Merrick laughed fondly and drew her into an embrace.
""You and Priscilla aren't the same.
""She came into our family as part of an arrangement to look after Rett. You're joining us because you're loved and wanted.""
Reassured, Caroline nestled into Merrick's arms, and they stood quietly watching the snow.
Priscilla couldn't quite define the ache in her chest.
Although Merrick stated a simple fact, hearing it aloud left her feeling unsettled.
At four-thirty in the afternoon, Priscilla went to the kitchen.
Every day at five o'clock sharp, Garrett required a cup of Americano, brewed by her personally.
Though he disliked her, he enjoyed the coffee she prepared.
Today was almost over, leaving her with only one day remaining. After that, she would no longer make coffee for Garrett.
She jotted the coffee-making steps on a sticky note and attached it to the machine.
Then, she found herself adding a second note.
""Helps you focus, but rest is important too.""
Putting the pen down, she placed this note beside the coffee mug.
Once the coffee was ready, Priscilla checked the clock: 4:50.
Her limbs stiff, she carried the mug to the study.
The door stood partly open.
Caroline's words reached her clearly. ""Rett, my wedding to Rick is in two days. I don't want to marry him. If you can divorce her, I'll back out today.""
Chapter 5
Priscilla froze in place.
Caroline and Merrick had just been sharing a sweet moment in the snow...
Yet, she needed to hear Garrett's response.
Through the gap in the door, she saw a rare flicker of anger in Garrett's usually impassive eyes.
""Caroline, what game are you playing with Rick and me?
""You broke off the engagement the minute I was injured. Priscilla stayed.
""I'm not divorcing her. You should go.""
Caroline wasn't ready to yield.
""Did you know my parents made me break it off?
""I tried everything to fight them—refusing to eat, hurting myself. Nothing made a difference.""
She paused before continuing, ""Everyone knows Priscilla's brother burns through money. She only stuck around for your family's wealth.""
Garrett said nothing, as if accepting the statement.
At her explanation, his face lost some of its earlier severity.
Then Caroline asked, ""If you won't divorce her, is it because you love her?""
""I never loved her.""
Garrett's answer came instantly, without hesitation.
At the words, Priscilla's hand trembled, making the cup rattle on its tray.
The door swung open immediately.
Caroline went pale seeing her.
""How long have you been standing there?""
Priscilla pushed down the swell of emotion inside. ""Since you asked him to divorce me.""
Hearing that, Caroline dropped all pretense of politeness. Her parting words were a direct order.
""Don't you dare repeat any of this.""
Once Caroline was gone, Priscilla stepped into the study.
She placed the tray down and handed the coffee to Garrett.
""Your coffee, Rett.""
Garrett knocked the cup over. ""Did you make a habit of eavesdropping?""
It hit the floor with a sharp crack, shattering.
Hot liquid splashed over Priscilla's hands and clothes, her skin reddening.
She felt no pain, only murmured, ""I'm sorry. It won't happen again.""
Then she bent to pick up the broken pieces.
At that moment, Garrett threw a blank check onto the floor in front of her.
""Write whatever your brother needs.
""I don't want a single word about this getting out.""
The sight of the blank check struck Priscilla as deeply ironic.
""Is this for my silence?""
""Think whatever you want,"" Garrett said, his voice icy.
Priscilla looked down. For a second, when Garrett spoke of her staying by his side, she had actually thought he recognized her loyalty.
But it was just to get a reaction from Caroline.
Priscilla stayed quiet, focusing on cleaning the spill.
Then, dark blood began to drip from her nose. She wiped at it with the back of her hand, but it kept coming.
She had no choice but to take the check and go back to her room.
In the room, as Priscilla was cleaning the blood from her face, she heard the door open.
""It's done. You and Rett are legally separated.""
Chloe's voice came from behind her.
Priscilla turned. Chloe held out a formal document.
It was a divorce certificate.
Five years ago, the Crawford family had obtained the marriage licenses for her and Garrett without either of them needing to be present.
They had ended it the same way.
Seeing her silence, Chloe spoke again, mistaking it for regret.
""When do you intend to leave?""
Priscilla gathered herself. ""Tonight.""
Tomorrow, she would be gone for good...
Chapter 6
Chloe gave a cold laugh. ""In such a rush. Your family isn't just social climbers—the women in your family seem absolutely desperate to land a man.""
She continued, ""Go if you must, but Rett doesn't hear a word about this until the wedding is over.
""I don't want your presence putting a damper on our family's happiness.
""And once you leave, stay away from us. For good.""
With that final remark, Chloe left.
Priscilla put the certificate away and, as usual, saw to Garrett's dinner.
Heavy snow fell outside. Instead of their walk in the gardens as usual, Priscilla helped him back to his room early.
When he was ready to retire, Priscilla assisted him to bed.
But after two days, her body was stiff and unresponsive.
As Garrett lay back, she lost her balance and fell against him.
For a moment, she seemed to hear the sound of his heartbeat.
The subtle, clean scent of his skin surrounded her.
""Sorry.""
Priscilla pulled away quickly, her fingers stiff and awkward as she tried to smooth his clothes.
Garrett noticed her clumsiness and frowned.
""Five years, and you still can't manage this properly?""
The words left Priscilla momentarily disoriented.
""Five years, yes...""
She heard herself ask, ""There's something I've always wanted to know.""
""What?"" Garrett's tone was flat.
Priscilla looked directly at him and asked, ""Did you ever love me a little?""
Silence hung in the air.
Garrett met her gaze, then looked away.
""Never.""
She had expected that.
A faint smile touched her lips. Her hand, resting on his chest, moved to undo the buttons of his pajama tops.
""Since you never truly cared for me, just be with me tonight.""
Garrett's brow furrowed. ""What did you say?""
Priscilla held his gaze.
""I want to sleep with you as your wife.""
Garrett stared, taken aback, as she continued unfastening the buttons.
Only when her hand moved lower did he catch her wrist.
""Priscilla, I don't sleep with women I feel nothing for.""
Seeing the complete lack of desire in his eyes, Priscilla paused. Shame washed over her, her cheeks burning.
She pulled her hands back and pushed herself up with effort.
""Get some rest.""
Garrett said nothing more. He turned on his side and closed his eyes.
Priscilla quietly drew the covers over him.
She turned off the light and went back to the sofa she'd used for five years.
Only when Garrett's breathing became slow and even did she finally rise and go to the study.
She didn't see his eyes open the moment the bedroom door shut.
In the study, Priscilla smoothed a sheet of writing paper on the desk.
She picked up a pen and began to write.
""Rett, by the time you read this, I'll be gone.""
""You might not believe me, but these last five years, my feelings for you were real.""
""I know you never stopped caring for Caroline. Now that we're divorced, you're free of a wife you never wanted.""
""May you spend your life with someone who truly matters to you.""
Her handwriting was clumsy, her fingers too stiff to hold the pen properly.
When she finished, she carefully placed the letter, along with the blank check and his divorce certificate, into the second drawer on the left side of his desk.
That drawer held all his keepsakes of Caroline: photographs, letters...
When she was done, Priscilla couldn't help one last look at Garrett.
She returned to the bedroom.
In the faint light from the streetlamp outside, she watched him sleep soundly and murmured silently in her heart, ""Goodbye, Garrett.""
Chapter 7
Then, taking only her own divorce certificate, Priscilla left the Crawford's villa.
She stepped outside the gates, snow still falling steadily.
Priscilla looked at the document in her hand, brushing off the flakes that had settled on it.
Now she was no longer a daughter-in-law of the Crawford family, nor Garrett's wife.
She was just herself.
She was finally free to leave.
But first, she wanted one last look at her mother and brother.
Her movements were more stiff as she made her way to the curb and hailed a taxi.
""Westheimer Road, number fifty-nine.""
Thirty minutes later, she arrived at her parents' house.
She approached the front door and keyed in the security code she knew by heart.
The door stayed shut. A cold, automated voice responded.
""Invalid code. Please try again.""
Priscilla paused, then tried several more times. The same message greeted her each time.
They had changed the code without telling her.
Snow settled heavily on her, dusting her hair and eyelashes white.
She felt no physical cold, but a deep chill settled in her heart.
She understood it then. For a woman, adulthood meant being without a true home. Neither her parents' house nor her husband's house was really her own.
Priscilla remained standing there through the night.
The sky gradually lightened at dawn.
Muffled voices reached her from inside—her mother and her brother, Raymond Burnett.
She was about to knock when Monica's voice grew louder as she moved closer to the door. ""Ray, I saw your sister yesterday. Can you believe she told me she wants a divorce?""
Raymond sounded stunned. ""A divorce?
""The Crawford family paid us 1.6 billion dollars for her to marry Garrett, that invalid.
""If she leaves him, how are we supposed to pay that back?""
At his words, Priscilla's hand froze mid-air. Disbelief washed over her.
She had always blamed Merrick for the arranged marriage. She never knew her own family had sold her.
Everyone knew. She was the only one kept in the dark.
Her knuckles turned white.
A sudden, overwhelming fatigue hit her.
Just then, the front door swung open.
Monica, standing behind it, stared at the sight of Priscilla—deathly pale and blanketed in snow.
""Lurking out here in silence! Are you trying to give me a heart attack?""
Priscilla looked at her mother, eyes growing moist. ""I'm back, Mom.""
Monica frowned.
""You're married. What are you doing here?""
Priscilla didn't answer.
She carefully pulled the formal document from inside her coat and held it out.
""Mom. Garrett and I are legally separated.""
Monica stared, speechless for a moment.
She snapped back to reality and struck Priscilla with a sharp, stinging slap.
""Who said you could do that?
""Didn't I make myself clear? You die as a Garrett's wife!""
A metallic taste flooded Priscilla's throat. Dark red blood seeped from the corner of her lip.
Drop by drop, it stained the pristine snow at her feet.
She looked at her mother numbly. ""Mom, I am dying.""
Rage flashed in Monica's eyes. She shoved Priscilla backward.
""Then go die somewhere else!""
Priscilla landed hard in the snow. The hand she braced against the ground was so pale that it was almost indistinguishable from the snow.
She looked up at her furious mother, unable to speak.
Monica glared down at her.
""If you're not dead, get back to the Crawford's villa on your knees. Apologize to his parents. Apologize to Garrett.
""Beg for their forgiveness. Beg him to take you back.
""Or I swear, I'll disown you. Don't you ever come back here.""
Any last hope Priscilla held for Monica died then. She pushed herself up with great effort.
""Don't worry. I won't come back.
""I just wanted to see you both one last time.""
Wiping the blood from her mouth, she added, ""Dad supported you when he was alive. The Crawford family has supported you since he died.
""You'll have to manage on your own now. No one is coming to support you.""
With that, she turned and walked away into the relentless storm.
Chapter 8
In the Crawford's villa, Garrett woke to an empty room.
Priscilla was gone.
The staff entered to help him begin his day.
Seeing them, he frowned slightly.
""Where's my wife?""
A maid answered promptly, ""The housekeeper said Mrs. Crawford returned to her parents' house, sir.""
Garrett said nothing.
His expression remained cold as they assisted him.
Priscilla knew he disliked being helped. She always made sure he was settled before attending to anything else, no matter how urgent it was.
""Is it because I turned her away last night?"" he wondered.
After breakfast, Garrett went straight to his study.
He had just opened his laptop when Merrick walked in without knocking.
Garrett looked up, puzzled. ""What is it?""
Merrick hesitated, then spoke his mind.
""Rett, my wedding is tomorrow. I need to hear you say it. That you feel truly happy for Cara and me.""
He knew about Caroline and his brother's past.
He needed this settled before he married her.
A chill entered Garrett's eyes.
""I wish you both happiness,"" he said slowly.
Hearing that, Merrick finally relaxed.
""Thank you, Rett.""
As he turned to leave, he noticed Garrett's pallor.
""You look awful. Are you okay?""
For a second, Garrett seemed uneasy.
""Didn't get much rest. I've got work to do. Leave me alone.""
In truth, he hadn't slept at all, only closing his eyes briefly near dawn.
""OK.""
After Merrick left, Garrett took out his phone.
He opened a private, locked album containing 1,390 photos of Caroline.
He selected all and deleted them.
Then he blocked her number and all her WhatsApp account.
Finished, he looked out the window.
The snow continued to fall, heavy and unceasing.
Almost without thinking, he picked up his phone and sent a message to Priscilla.
""When are you coming back?""
An hour passed. No reply came.
His frown deepened. He sent two more.
""If you like it there so much, then stay.""
""If you're not back today, don't bother coming back at all.""
He set the phone aside and focused on his work, ignoring it completely afterward.
Priscilla never replied.
That evening, Merrick's bachelor party filled parts of the house with friends, while everyone else there bustled with his wedding preparations, except Garrett.
He stayed alone in his room, reading.
Suddenly, he heard his door open quietly. Assuming it was Priscilla, he asked coldly, ""Decided to return?""
But when he turned, it was Caroline standing there, her eyes red.
""What are you doing here?""
Caroline asked, the question sharp with accusation, ""You blocked me on everything. Why?""
""I'm marrying your brother tomorrow. Do you really want to stand there and watch?""
Garrett saw the hurt in her eyes. His fingers tightened around the pages of his book.
""Everyone lives with their choices.
""You'll be my brother's wife. We should keep our distance.""
Caroline's heart sank at his words.
""If that's how it is, at least make sure Ms. Burnett keeps our secret.""
Garrett looked away, avoiding her gaze.
""Priscilla isn't one to gossip.""
Caroline watched him for a long moment, then offered a bitter smile.
""You know, Rett?
""The way you just defended her reminds me of how you used to defend me when you loved me.""
Garrett closed his book and looked at her, his expression blank.
""You should go.""
Chapter 9
Caroline gave him one long, last look, then left.
Only after the door clicked shut did Garrett look toward where she had been standing, then back out the window, watching her figure disappear into the distance.
He took out his phone again. Still, no reply came from Priscilla.
What he didn't know was that Priscilla had already purchased a burial plot for herself.
After leaving the Burnett's residence, she had gone to the funeral home.
She bought a plot next to her father's, then paid the staff to arrange her own funeral service.
By the time she finished, it was evening.
Priscilla stopped at a florist for a bouquet of white roses, then hailed a taxi.
""Evergreen Cemetery, please.""
The driver hesitated for a moment at the destination, then replied, ""Sure.""
On the road, the driver's wife called. He spoke to her gently.
""Sweetheart, I'll be home for dinner after this ride.
""If it gets too late, don't wait up.
""I love you.""
Through the rearview mirror, Priscilla saw his smile linger long after the call ended.
That sort of happiness was something she'd always yearned for.
Garrett would never speak to her with that kind of tenderness.
Catching her pale reflection in the mirror, the driver asked, ""It's late, miss, and snowing hard.
""Are you sure your family knows you're going to the cemetery alone?""
Priscilla tried to smile, but her face had grown too stiff.
She answered slowly, ""I don't have any family left.
""Last night, my husband and I separated legally.
""This morning, my mother and brother disowned me.""
""I'm sorry..."" The driver was taken aback, quickly apologized, and fell silent.
Watching the snowy landscape pass by, Priscilla felt she finally understood why she hadn't been able to move on—her ties to this world weren't fully severed.
In this world now, she had no one left to miss and nothing left to care for.
Two hours later, they arrived at the cemetery.
The driver dropped her off and drove away.
Priscilla walked through the gates and laid the roses at her father's headstone.
She checked the time: 11:30 PM.
She had fallen into the sea at midnight. Only half an hour remained...
Her gaze lifted to her father's portrait on the headstone, a gentle smile captured in the monochrome image.
""Dad, I'll be with you soon.""
Speaking to the air, she dragged her rigid body to her own adjacent plot.
Leaning against the headstone, she took out her phone and sent a WhatsApp message to the funeral director.
""Please come to Evergreen Cemetery first thing tomorrow.""
""Bury me deep. I don't want to be walked over.""
Only then did she notice Garrett's three messages.
""When are you coming back?""
""If you like it there so much, then stay.""
""If you're not back today, don't bother coming back at all.""
After a long moment, she decided to say goodbye.
She dialed his number. When he answered, his voice was icy.
""It's 11:45. What do you want?
""If you're done being my wife, then stay gone.""
Fifteen minutes remained.
Blood rose suddenly in Priscilla's throat, spilling onto her white coat.
She wiped at it clumsily.
""Don't worry,"" she managed. ""I'm already somewhere you'll never find.""
Garrett let out a cold, dismissive sound.
""What are you talking about? Get back here.
""Or don't ever come back.""
She kept wiping the blood from her mouth as he spoke, but it kept coming.
""Garrett, I can't come back.""
She struggled to speak, but Garrett said nothing in return.
A long silence passed before Garrett's voice returned. ""Fine. Stay with your family, then. I don't want to see you again.""
With a sharp click, the call ended.
Priscilla listened to the dial tone with a faint, pained smile. Her thoughts began to blur. ""But my family doesn't want me either...
""I picked a good spot right next to Dad. He dedicated his whole life to the family. Now I can keep him company.
""Finally, I'm only my own.""
She murmured as the blood flowed freely, too weak to wipe it away.
Slowly, her stiff body grew still, the faint rise and fall of her chest fading.
The moment her consciousness faded, the phone slipped from her hand.

In Thebes, in Palmyra, his will and mind have become old and dilapidated as they. He carries ruins to ruins…”  
– Ralph Waldo Emerson.

‘Maybe, not everything can be found in books and introspection.’  
I peeked up from my third attempt at Beyond Good and Evil.  
‘What do you mean?’  
Pat really bloomed into the spitting image of her mother – at least when the latter was still making sense. They shared the same jade eyes and maybe lighter ruby hair. The only things she inherited from me were my work ethic and rationality. “Rationality”, that was certainly not coming from her mother.  
We had a little father-daughter moment in what had become my living room – me reading on my old hazelnut wingback chair, and her repeating the same three cords on her newly bought acoustic guitar, sitting on the grey family couch, on the other side of the coffee table. My toes crawled deeper in my winter furry slippers. The persistent smell of pumpkin soup kept teasing my appetite.  
‘Every time we talk about travel, you brush the topic away as something puerile.’  
‘And how is it not?’ I protested. ‘I have seen many people leave for the “adventure of a lifetime” and come back to the same miserable life, with only extra sunburns. Nothing had changed.’  
‘Maybe they changed.’  
‘Not that I noticed.’  
Pat shrugged. And went back to pinching her cords. I savoured my victory with a sip of bitter black coffee, glanced with satisfaction at my wall of vintage cedar bookshelves overflowing with books, and plunged back into Nietzsche’s unfathomable metaphors.  
‘Are you sure?’ She startled me back.  
‘What? About what?’ I answered, exasperated.  
‘About the people who travelled. You said you didn’t notice any difference.’  
She really was like her mother.  
I boiled, ‘Yes, I am sure. Why do you ask? Are you thinking about “finding yourself in Bali” like your mother did before…’ I closed my eyes for a moment. ‘I am sorry.’  
When I looked at her again, Pat’s eyes had moved to the family photographs on the bookshelves – two portraits of her, one at six and the other at twelve, and the one with just the two of us at the history museum when she was sixteen.  
‘Maybe you should give it a try.’ She let go, still gazing at the pictures.  
Her eyes fell back on her guitar. She pinched the same three cords again.

‘Love you too, sweety. Let me know how it goes with the guitar.’  
We hugged. The front door closed behind her bursting untamable ruby hair.  
I plodded back to the living room and glanced at Beyond Good and Evil, lurking at me from the armchair.  
‘Not today, Friedrich.’  
I walked to the library, grabbed our history museum picture, and sat on the couch. The small ashen frame felt cold in my hand. A sunflower light beamed from the old ceiling lamp. Right from the bay window, the large automated white panel heater clicked on.  
I gazed at the picture. My thumb brushed her hair. She looked so jaunty in the black leather jacket she wore during her metal years. My eyes turned to the forty-something-year-old on her right. I wouldn’t get into these jeans anymore. The memory of not constantly feeling cold at the top of my head teased me. I sighed.  
OK, let’s do this exercise. What about these idiots then? How did they really come back?  
I closed my eyes and tilted my head back on the cold concrete wall.  
There was Miriam from HR. She took a two-month unpaid leave in… was it 2001? I remember she went to South America. She came back with a massive bacterial infection due to food poisoning.  
I chuckled, ‘That’s one!’  
But the memory refused to end. She looked so happy when joking about it… so happy… she beamed, until she quit. What was it for? Opening a cafe or something?  
‘That’s one…’ I muttered.  
I closed my eyes again. Another one?  
There was this nutcase, Li or something, Ed’s cousin. He went to Mongolia for a couple of weeks. That must have been expensive. And then…  
And then he went again. Ed told me he renegotiated his contract to have two months off per year. What was it for again? I dived deeper into the memory.  
Oh, yeah! The orphanage. He volunteered there for two months per year. I wondered if he was still going there. I hadn’t seen Ed in almost ten years.  
‘That’s two…’ I admitted, defeated.  
My eyes went up to the bookshelves again. Behind the empty spot, where the frame I was now holding sat, was a book I had never noticed. A book Rachel left behind.

Face-to-face interaction is one of the biggest advantages. In a physical office, I can have impromptu discussions with my coworkers, exchange ideas instantly, & develop relationships that are frequently more difficult to foster in a virtual setting. These exchanges promote teamwork and camaraderie, which can improve cooperation and creativity. Innovative solutions can be sparked by brainstorming sessions when people are in the same room, something that video calls occasionally lack.\
\
Also, having a specific physical area can aid in drawing a distinct line between personal & professional life. It can be challenging to adopt a professional mindset when working from home, but once I enter the office, I do. Because it reduces the distractions that are frequently present in a home setting, the organized environment of an office can improve concentration and productivity. A professional environment can also give workers a sense of responsibility and inspire them to give their best work.\
\
When considering whether to invest in physical office space or opt for a virtual office, it's essential to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each option. A related article that delves into the legal aspects of business operations is available at How are Trade Secrets Protected Under Bahrain Law?. This article provides valuable insights into the importance of safeguarding your business's intellectual property, which can be particularly relevant for companies operating in a virtual environment.\
\
Because it enables me to leave work behind at the end of the day, this physical separation between work and home life can also improve mental health. The Benefits of Using a Virtual Office On the other hand, in today's hectic world, the benefits of using a virtual office are becoming more and more obvious. The flexibility it provides is among its most alluring advantages. I value flexibility, so I'm grateful that a virtual office lets me work from anywhere—at home, at a coffee shop, or while traveling.\
\
In addition to improving my work-life balance, this flexibility allows me to customize my workspace to fit my needs and preferences. I can decide where I am most productive, which can improve my general well-being & job satisfaction. Also, it is difficult to overlook the cost savings that virtual offices frequently offer. Businesses can drastically cut overhead expenses like rent, utilities, and maintenance by doing away with the need for physical space. Companies are able to devote resources to other important areas, like staff development or technology upgrades, thanks to this financial freedom.\
\
This, in my opinion, implies that companies can invest more in their employees, which will boost morale and retention rates. Also, no matter where team members are located, virtual offices frequently offer access to cutting-edge communication tools and technologies that promote cooperation and connectivity. Considerations for Selecting Physical Office Space There are a number of important factors that I need to keep in mind when selecting physical office space. Location is the most important factor. Both clients & employees should have easy access to the office.\

I frequently find myself analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of various neighborhoods, taking into account things like parking availability, public transportation options, & proximity to facilities like cafes & restaurants. The actual layout and design of the office space is another crucial element. An atmosphere that is welcoming and open can, in my opinion, have a big impact on worker morale and output.\

When considering whether to invest in physical office space or opt for a virtual office, it's essential to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each option. A virtual office can provide flexibility and cost savings, while a physical space may enhance your company's credibility and foster team collaboration.

For expert guidance on company formation in Bahrain, visit the provided link.When choosing an office, I try to find areas that allow for both concentrated work and collaboration. A positive environment that promotes creativity and teamwork can be created with elements like natural light, cozy furniture, and breakout spaces. I also take into account the possibility of future expansion; long-term success depends on selecting a location that can handle growth.\
\
Considerations for Selecting a Virtual Office Selecting a virtual office also necessitates careful consideration. The variety of services the provider offers is one of the main factors. I want to make sure that the virtual office solution has all the necessary features, like access to meeting rooms when needed, mail handling services, & a business address. These services improve my company's reputation while also offering useful assistance for daily tasks.\
\
The technology infrastructure offered by the virtual office service is another important factor. For my team and I to work together smoothly, I need dependable communication tools. Project management software, video conferencing capabilities, and high-speed internet access are all crucial elements that could make or ruin my virtual office experience. I also think about customer service; having prompt help on hand can be very helpful when technical problems occur or when I need advice on how to use different features efficiently. Cost Comparison of Physical and Virtual Office Space: In my opinion, it is crucial to consider both direct and indirect costs when comparing the costs of physical and virtual office spaces. Rent, utilities, insurance, and maintenance fees are examples of the high overhead costs associated with physical office spaces.\
\
Particularly for startups or small businesses like mine, these costs can mount up rapidly and put a strain on a company's budget. On the other hand, because they do away with a lot of these overhead costs, virtual offices typically have lower fixed costs. But it's crucial to think about how each choice will affect things in the long run. Even though virtual offices might initially appear more affordable, I have to consider how well they fit with my company's objectives. For example, despite the higher expenses, investing in a physical office might be more advantageous in the long run if my business is expected to grow quickly or needs to meet with clients frequently.\
\
In the end, carrying out a comprehensive cost analysis enables me to make a decision that is consistent with my financial plan. Flexibility and Scalability of Virtual Office Solutions The intrinsic flexibility and scalability of virtual office solutions is one of their best qualities. I value flexibility in business operations, so I'm grateful that virtual offices let me scale my operations up or down in response to demand without being constrained by a physical lease. I can readily modify my virtual office services to satisfy shifting demands in the event that my company experiences seasonal fluctuations or rapid growth without having to deal with major expenses or logistical difficulties. Also, this flexibility includes work arrangements in addition to scaling services.\
\
I can hire talent from anywhere in the world without being constrained by geography thanks to a virtual office. This gives me access to a larger pool of talent and enables me to assemble a diverse team that each has special talents and viewpoints. In today's dynamic business environment, the capacity to quickly adjust to changes in the market or employee needs is crucial. Sustaining Professionalism in a Virtual Office Building trust with stakeholders and clients requires maintaining professionalism in a virtual office.\
\
Using a trustworthy virtual office provider that provides a distinguished business address is one way I guarantee professionalism. This not only improves the reputation of my business but also gives customers assurance about our authenticity. Also, I am able to have crucial conversations in a suitable setting because I have access to professional meeting spaces when needed. Maintaining professionalism in a virtual environment also heavily depends on effective communication. I place a high priority on using business-like email addresses and communication channels that represent my brand.\
\
Frequent check-ins with my team via messaging apps or video calls help maintain alignment on expectations & goals while fostering a sense of connection. Even in a virtual workplace, I can maintain professionalism by setting clear communication guidelines and upholding high standards in every encounter. The Effect of Office Space on Business Culture and Productivity It is impossible to overestimate the influence of office space on business culture and productivity. A well-designed physical office, in my opinion, encourages employee creativity and teamwork.\
\
While designated quiet areas allow for concentrated work when needed, open spaces promote impromptu interactions that can result in creative problem-solving. Employee morale can be greatly impacted by an office's general atmosphere; when workers feel inspired and at ease, they are more likely to be involved and productive. On the other hand, although virtual offices provide flexibility, they also make it difficult to foster a company culture. Building relationships between distant team members who might never meet in person requires deliberate effort.\
\
I concentrate on putting in place frequent team-building exercises and encouraging open lines of communication that encourage participation and inclusivity in order to combat this difficulty. I can foster an atmosphere where workers feel appreciated and inspired to produce their best work by emphasizing company culture in both physical and virtual settings. In conclusion, there are distinct advantages & difficulties associated with both physical and virtual offices.\
\
I understand how crucial it is to match my decision with the objectives, culture, and operational requirements of my company as I consider these options for my enterprise. Making wise choices will ultimately determine my organization's future success, whether I choose the flexibility of a virtual solution or the collaborative energy of a physical location.\

I mean my first bf was 1+ year and at least three men got me to delete bumble

Looking back on what misery I had dating overthinking everyone’s moves and how it felt and dissecting conversations, oh it’s misery!

I kissed my bf I met on hinge tonight and said I ain’t ever doing that swiping shit again. And he went to bed and I went into the office he built me as the first man I ever lived with in my 30s and the closest I’ve ever been to marriage

I did everything right while dating. I fixed my attachment. I texted at the exact right times. I followed the perfect formula, once a week then twice then maybe after a year we move in and a year after that we will get engaged. I’ll adopt so there is no baby worries as I enter my 40s.

lol and no regrets I’m glad I did all that therapy about relationships and healthy boundaries

But the guy I actually ended up with?

I went to his house and never left within three months. I thought those bullshit stories were for other people without childhood trauma but no…

And I cannot believe my first boyfriend on bumble I would get in fights with about seeing him more than once a week. And I made every excuse for his avoidant ass, we’re busy, there is a bridge, he’s an engineer

The moral of this story is fuck your dating rules and the person who wants to marry you is going to bring you home and never let you leave. You’ll introduce the cats with a vague clearance from the landlord. He will be a hot feminist and abolitionist. Ok getting off track don’t get me banned from Reddit

When you tell him you can’t find your keys he will say can I call a locksmith. He will build you an office in his spare room, bring home flowers, and buy you a bath pillow cuz you took over the spare bathroom.

You will go home with him one day and only go back to bring your cat that he bought supplies for.

I (28 F) just need some advice about my relationship of 2.5 years with my ( 32M) boyfriend.

This is my first serious relationship,  so please no mean comments.  My boyfriend and I have been having a lot of problems.  I can't get over the past to be honest,  he sext 3 different women. One he claimed didn't know well but was asking her about inappropriate things as he said ""it's juts sex,  it's normal"". 2 years ago he sent a woman he was sexual with prior a message saying he's ""hard"" and then gave her his address and said he has a bachelor pad.  We were exclusive then. 

The problem that happened 3 weeks ago. He mentioned his ex girlfriend during a late Chrismas gift exchange. I bought him shoes he asked why  I bought them smiling,  I did oh because you mentioned you needed new shoes so I got him. He then said oh it's a family tradition and my past to buy me shoes. I heard that and stayed quiet because I know it would be about his ex.  He continued saying his ""past"" bought him shoes and got upset because he didn't remember it was a pastor he picked up,  so he answered her saying shoes are shoes. I looked at him and did why are you telling me an inside joke about you ex.  If this was the first or second time he bought he up I would be like okay.  But he's called me her name 4 different times,  once when it shared good news,  2 when he was yelling at me and in July he was arguing with me because I was asking for more foreplay and he said he didn't want to yup lol. So long story short he packed my things and basically kicked me out,  I went back to return the air fryer he got me and saw he took all my pictures down after only 1 day,  even in Facebook. 

When i tried to understand why he keeps bringing up his ex after 3 years,  he said it was a joke, I was just sharing i thought you'd laugh but you never laugh.  Today,  the first time I'm seeing him and him saying we'll have a nice date night he just took me to coffee.  He started a dumb debate.  He knows our political views are different was reading about something and I merely said i don't think it's right. He jumped down my throat said dumb things then called me a ""libtard"" I looked at him shocked and did why are you calling me names when I hear wanted to relax and enjoy the day.  Why being this up and call me a libtard. Why hurt me.  

He said you're emotional so I called you that.  I shut down after that. I so talking,  I became so quiet and thought wow he's supposed to be winning me back and he's not even trying.

1qmfpkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qmfpkk/change_your_life_with_this_one_habit_nobody_talks/,Change your life with this ONE habit nobody talks about: DAILY READING,"Everyone wants a ""one habit that changes everything."" You see it all the time on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube—people claiming cold showers, waking up at 5 am, or drinking celery juice will *magically* fix your life. But here’s what’s wild: the one habit that actually rewires your brain, sharpens your focus, and compounds over time like crazy? **Daily reading.** Not scrolling. Not reading tweets. Actual deep reading. It sounds simple, almost too obvious—but nearly no one sticks with it.

Most people stopped reading consistently after high school. In fact, a Pew Research study found that **23% of adults didn’t read a single book** in the last year. Yet the people we look up to most? CEOs, creators, thinkers—they read daily. Bill Gates reads 50 books a year. Naval Ravikant calls reading a *form of leverage*. It’s how you absorb decades of someone else’s knowledge in hours. This post breaks down why daily reading might be the actual cheat code you’re missing—and how to do it without burning out or falling asleep by page 3.

**Here’s how daily reading reshapes your life (backed by real studies and tools to do it right):**

* **Daily reading literally rewires your brain for focus and long-term thinking**
   * Neuroscientist Dr. Maryanne Wolf (author of *Reader, Come Home*) explains that deep reading activates neural pathways for empathy, logical reasoning, and imagination. Skimming doesn't do that.
   * A study in *Frontiers in Psychology* showed that regular literary reading leads to better theory of mind—aka understanding other people, which helps in relationships, work, everything.
   * Reading also trains your attention spans. Unlike social media, which fragments your thinking, reading forces your brain to stay with one idea long enough to process it deeply. That’s rare now.
* **Reading cuts through the noise and upgrades your mental models**
   * Shane Parrish from Farnam Street talks about building a ""latticework of mental models"" through reading. Instead of outsourcing thinking, you build frameworks in your head by reading across disciplines.
   * The National Endowment for the Arts reported that frequent readers are more likely to engage in civic and cultural activities. Why? Because reading helps you *make sense* of the world instead of just reacting to it.
   * Authors like James Clear (*Atomic Habits*) and Cal Newport (*Deep Work*) didn't invent ideas—they synthesized hundreds of books and studies. You can do that too, but only if you read widely and consistently.
* **Not all reading counts: HOW you read matters more than you think**
   * Don’t confuse input with impact. Scrolling Medium articles doesn’t give the same depth as finishing a full book. A good rule: **""Read fewer things, but read them twice.""** That’s from author Ryan Holiday, who has built a career on Stoic philosophy by reading ancient works dozens of times.
   * Use tools that make reading easier and more consistent:
      * *Libby app* connects to your local library for free audiobooks and ebooks.
      * *Readwise* helps you highlight and resurface key insights (crucial for retention).
      * *The Daily Stoic* or *Blinkist* can be shallow but useful for sparking interest before diving deeper.
* **If you struggle to make it a habit, try this simple system:**
   * Make it frictionless: Leave your book next to your toothbrush or phone charger.
   * Read *before* screen time: Your brain is freshest in the morning. Don’t waste it on IG stories.
   * Pair it with a trigger habit: Like after coffee or during commute (audiobooks count here).
   * Start with 10 minutes: You don’t need to finish a book in a week. You need to show up daily.

Reading is one of the only habits that compounds *intellectually*, *emotionally*, and *financially*. It connects you with greatest minds, increases your attention, improves your communication, and makes you sharper in any field. No gimmick. No expensive course. Just you, a book, and time.

If you’re not reading daily, it’s not your fault—tech platforms are designed to hijack your focus. But you can take it back. Start with a single page today. It’s the last free superpower in the world.",1,1769336974.0,MomentumOne,1,1.0,False
1qmfp2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1qmfp2n/meal_size_control_and_coffee/,Meal size control and coffee,"So I started doing IF mostly out of curiosity. Saw some doctors talk about it and the enormous benefits it provides for the body (autophagy, HGH increase, lower insulint, fat burning etc.) so I got curious. If nothing else it may help burn some visceral fat which is always a plus :)  
I wanna mention that I'm not doing this for weight loss. I'm 177cm *tall*, around 80kg, 45 y/o male. So I'm good. A bit of belly fat never killed noone :)

Anyway I started with 2 weeks for 12/12, then I shifted to 18/6 and now I've been at it for a month. With a short interruption over holidays (short means 1 day) because of obvious reasons. My eating window is from 12h (noon) up to 18h. I hate losing breakfast which I enjoy in, but it's easier to go to sleep not hungry AF :)

So my biggest issue right now is eating normal quantites of food when I break fast. I noticed I can eat significantly more that my usual meal would look like. So I gotta force myself stop eating ""early"" based on quantity alone, not based on satiety. And it's lunch time, which is usually biggest meal of the day.  
I read somewhere that the trick is ""easing into it""? Kinda like eat something small then wait 30min before a normal meal.. something like that?  
However I approach it, I'd like to be able to eat a full meal at the end of my 6h window so I go into the fast on a full stomach.. simply to try an be hungry for the shortest amount of time :)

What do you generally recommend for this?

One more question that's been bothering me.  
While fasting I only drink water and coffee (mokka pot).. but I do need to put some milk into the coffee. I did some measurements, I tend to put only 30ml of milk into my coffee.  
So I bought 0% fat milk because it has least calories.. so it is literally 10kcal per 30mil portion.  
And the actual question is - can I drink my coffee witih 10kcal of milk in it, about 3 times during my 18h fast without actually breaking the fast?  
When I say I don't want to break fast I mean that I do not want to break the beneficial processes happening in my body. Afterall that's what I'm doing it for.  
So I'm not worried about being 100% faithful to the concept.. 99.99% is good enoguh for me, as long as I'm actually achieving the purpose of it.  
My initial research showed that these 10kcal portions shouldn't be a problem but.. I'd like to be more certain :/
