## A Deeper Dive into sennheiser Momentum 4 Reviews

The Sennheiser Momentum‚Å£ 4 wireless review cycle was initially filled with praise, highlighting their extraordinary audio performance and adaptive noise cancellation. ‚Å£Autonomous tests consistently lauded the headphones' ability to deliver a balanced and detailed‚Äç sound signature,pleasing both audiophiles seeking‚Å§ nuanced audio and ‚Äçcasual listeners looking ‚Å£for an enjoyable listening experience. Though, as ‚Äånewer models have emerged, a more critical perspective has started to form. let‚Äôs break down the key aspects of the Sennheiser ‚ÄåMomentum 4, examining their strengths and weaknesses to provide a complete overview.

###‚Å¢ Sound Quality: Still‚Äå a Benchmark?

For many, the foundation of any premium headphone experience is sound quality. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 sound quality‚Äå quickly became a talking point‚Å¢ upon release, and for good reason. Sennheiser ‚Äãhas a ‚Å£long-standing reputation for delivering‚Å¢ exceptional audio, and the ‚Å¢Momentum 4 largely lives up to that legacy to this day. The headphones offer a wide soundstage, allowing you to discern individual instruments and sonic details ‚Å¢with ‚Å¢clarity. The bass response is rich and present without being overpowering, the‚Äã mids are clear and ‚Å£well-defined, and ‚Å§the highs are crisp and sparkling. Whether you're listening to classical music, podcasts, or heavy metal, the Momentum 4 provides a ‚Äåbalanced and engaging ‚Äålistening experience. Several Sennheiser headphones review articles consistently place ‚Å£the Momentum 4 among the top performers in their class for sound fidelity.

however, some competing‚Å£ models have‚Å§ begun to eclipse ‚Äãthe ‚Å¢Momentum 4 in particular areas. Certain newer headphones now offer slightly wider soundstages or more‚Å¢ customizable EQ settings, potentially offering an edge for very specific sonic preferences. Still, most listeners will be more than satisfied‚Äç with‚Äç the Sennheiser Momentum 4.

### Noise Cancellation: Blocking Out the‚Å£ World

Effective noise cancellation is a crucial ‚Å¢feature for many headphone users, especially those who travel frequently, work in noisy environments, or simply want to immerse‚Äç themselves in their music. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 ‚Äånoise cancelling review results have generally‚Å§ been positive, showcasing its effectiveness at reducing ambient sounds. The ‚Äçadaptive noise‚Å£ cancellation feature automatically adjusts the level of noise cancellation based on your surroundings, ensuring optimal performance in various environments.‚Å¢ Whether you're on a crowded train, in a ‚Äãbustling‚Å§ coffee shop, ‚Å¢or on a noisy airplane, the Momentum 4 can significantly reduce distractions and allow you to focus‚Å£ on ‚Å§what matters most.

That said,‚Äå the landscape of noise-canceling technology has advanced since the Momentum 4's initial release. While still very good, some‚Äç newer models boast improved algorithms and more‚Äã powerful‚Å§ processors that allow them to more effectively block out higher-frequency sounds. For those who‚Äç prioritize absolute silence above all‚Äã else, particularly‚Å§ in extremely noisy environments,‚Å¢ exploring these newer alternatives might potentially ‚Äåbe worthwhile. ‚ÄãHowever,for the vast majority of users,the Sennheiser Momentum 4 provides excellent noise cancellation that's suited for everyday use.

### Comfort and Design: Long-Lasting Wearability

Comfort is king when ‚Äçit‚Äå comes to over-ear headphones,especially for extended listening sessions. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 comfort levels have been a‚Å¢ point of discussion amongst ‚Äåusers. The headphones feature plush earcups and a lightweight design, making‚Å£ them‚Äã pleasant to wear for hours on end.The headband is also well-padded ‚Å¢and‚Å§ distributes weight‚Å§ evenly, ‚Äãpreventing pressure ‚Äãpoints and ensuring a secure and comfortable fit.

The design of the Momentum 4 is modern and understated, with a sleek matte finish and‚Äå minimalist aesthetic.Some users initially missed the‚Å¢ folding design of previous Momentum models,‚Å£ finding the case larger to accommodate the swiveling earcups.Though,the swivel design does contribute to a more comfortable fit‚Äã for many. Ultimately, the comfort and design of the Momentum 4‚Äå strike a good balance between ‚Äåaesthetics and ‚Å§ergonomics, making them suitable ‚Äçfor both casual listening and professional use. The Sennheiser ‚ÄãMomentum 4 pros and cons regularly mention‚Äã comfort in a positive ‚Äålight, solidifying its place as a comfortable noise-canceling‚Å£ headphone.

### Battery Life: Powering Your‚Äã Day

Long battery life is essential for wireless headphones, allowing you to enjoy‚Äã your music without constantly worrying‚Å§ about running out of ‚Å¢power. The Momentum 4 battery life review results have consistently praised‚Å£ its impressive battery performance, offering up to 60 hours of‚Äå listening time on a single charge. Even ‚Å¢with noise cancellation enabled,‚Äã you‚Äå can expect to get a solid 40-50 hours of playtime. The headphones also support fast charging, providing several hours of listening‚Äã time after just a few ‚Å¢minutes of charging.This long battery life makes the Momentum 4 ideal for ‚Å¢travel, long commutes, or extended work sessions. You can confidently use them throughout the day without needing to recharge,ensuring uninterrupted enjoyment of your audio content. It's important to note that battery life can vary depending on usage habits, ‚Äçsuch as volume levels and the use of noise cancellation, but the Momentum ‚Å£4 generally‚Å¢ delivers excellent battery performance.

### Considering the Competition: Sennheiser ‚Å£Momentum 4‚Äå Vs

The Sennheiser ‚Å§Momentum ‚Å£4 doesn't exist in a vacuum. Many other excellent headphones are vying for ‚Å§your attention and your hard-earned money. A Sennheiser Momentum 4 vs‚Äç comparison ‚Äçagainst other models is essential to determine if these ‚Äåheadphones‚Äã are the right fit for your needs. Let's consider a few key ‚Å¢competitors:

*   **Sony WH-1000XM5:** ‚ÄåThese headphones are frequently enough seen as the Momentum 4's primary rival. They offer slightly better noise cancellation in some situations and a ‚Äåmore customizable sound profile. However,the Momentum 4 often wins out in terms of sound quality clarity and a more balanced frequency response.

*   **Bose QuietComfort 45/ultra:** Bose is‚Äå renowned for its noise cancellation, and the QC45 and newer Ultra‚Å¢ models offer top-tier performance in this‚Å¢ area. Though, many reviewers find the Momentum 4‚Å§ to offer superior ‚Äçsound quality compared to Bose's‚Äã signature sound.

*   **Apple AirPods Max:** These headphones boast seamless integration with Apple devices and excellent build quality. however, their‚Å¢ high ‚Äåprice point and limited compatibility with non-Apple devices make‚Äã them‚Å§ a less versatile option than the Momentum 4 for many users.

When making your decision, carefully consider your priorities. If noise cancellation is paramount, the Sony or bose options might be slightly better. Though,if sound quality is your primary concern,the sennheiser Momentum 4 remains an excellent choice.

### Pricing and Value: Are They Still ‚Å£Worth the Investment?

The‚Äç Sennheiser Momentum 4 price has fluctuated‚Äç as its release. As newer models ‚Å¢have entered the market, you may find deals on the Momentum 4, making them an even more attractive‚Å§ option. Consider if you are ‚Äçlooking to buy sennheiser momentum 4 and wait for sennheiser‚Å§ momentum 4‚Å¢ deals. To find the sennheiser momentum 4 best price, it pays to ‚Äãshop and ‚Äåcompare.‚Å¢ Think about‚Äã asking, ""Were to buy sennheiser momentum 4"" from trusted retailers.

the key question remains: Is the Sennheiser Momentum 4 still‚Å§ worth its price in 2025? Given its‚Å£ premium sound quality, effective noise cancellation, comfortable design, and long battery‚Å£ life, the Momentum 4 still offers excellent‚Å¢ value for money, especially if you can find it ‚Äãat a discounted‚Äã price.‚Å¢ If your main priority is audiophile-grade sound and ‚Å£all-around performance, the answer is likely yes.

### Potential Sennheiser‚Äç Momentum 4 Choice Options

If the Sennheiser Momentum 4‚Å£ doesn't quite meet your needs or budget, several alternatives are‚Å¢ worth considering. These options provide different‚Å£ combinations of features, price points, and performance characteristics:

* Sony WH-1000XM5 or the newer XM6 when it releases in the ‚Å£future.
* Bose QuietComfort 45 or newer ‚ÄåQuietComfort Ultra
* Jabra‚Äç Elite 85h

Remember to‚Äã weigh your personal preferences and priorities when considering ‚Å¢an alternative. Features, price, ‚Äãand brands always play a important role in ‚Äçchoice making.[[Explore Top Rated sennheiser momentum 4 reviews on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=sennheiser momentum 4 reviews)

In the beginning of the relationship we were definitely in our ‚Äúhoney moon phase‚Äù and talked 24/7. This time in our relationship was so fun and everything and I felt so close to him. At this time, we both shared our location with each other just to see what the other did throughout the day. I was fine with it- up until recently. He used to not mention anything about it and neither did I. Occasionally he would say something like ‚ÄúAre you at chick fil a? I wish i could go,‚Äù and I would laugh about it. At the time I didn‚Äôt really care about it and just kind of blew it off. I‚Äôve never really checked his location and I still don‚Äôt, but it feels as though recently he‚Äôs been checking mine routinely. I asked him how often he checks it and he said he checks it every time he responds to me because it‚Äôs ‚Äúright there‚Äù. Obviously it‚Äôs hard to have trust in a long distance relationship, but I don‚Äôt know if I can stand it anymore. He regularly texts me something about where I am, and even asks me what i‚Äôm doing at places. After school I went to a coffee shop and he was texting me why I went there instead of going home. I love him so much but it‚Äôs kind of getting annoying. If I don‚Äôt respond in a certain matter of time he will say something along the lines of ‚ÄúI see your at home why aren‚Äôt you messaging me back?‚Äù Whenever I confront him about it he always say it‚Äôs a joke and he doesn‚Äôt actually care, but I feel like he‚Äôs just saying that so I don‚Äôt get mad. I am not doing anything suspicious and the only time I‚Äôm out is if I am getting food or at school/gym. I would understand if I was always at some random persons house but I literally don‚Äôt hangout with anyone. On the one day I do hangout with someone and don‚Äôt have time to respond to him, he‚Äôll message ‚Äúhope you‚Äôre having fun with (friend‚Äôs name).‚Äù The reason why I‚Äôm asking for help on what to say is because I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll think it‚Äôs because I want to cheat or something. I have a feeling he‚Äôs going to be like ‚Äúwhy do you want to stop sharing your location? I just think it‚Äôs weird because we‚Äôve already been sharing it this whole time?‚Äù but I just really don‚Äôt want to deal with it anymore.

Due the quantity of work, she cut a lot of corners which we are paying for now. Due to all the fixing, there is more backlog that myself and my junior have been struggling to get on top of. We'd been offered another part-time resource from the contractor that the junior works for and the deal was nearly signed and sealed. Then last week, my lead went to another manager to see about getting budget for an extra person on our books. He then told me that this manager had budget and suggested they try and get back the person who was doing the job before me. 
This had knocked me for a six. I know this woman was really popular and the guys keep referring to me as ""the new Betty"" (not her real name lol). One guy, who was very close to her, met her for coffee one day and came back with brownies she made. He told everyone that Betty had sent brownies up for us to eat and then said to me ""except yours. Yours is poisoned"". With that buried in my emotional trigger files, I'm really worried about how I'll deal with this person. My boss told me she very confident and mouthy and ""will tell you how it is"". I am not good with dealing with people like that. My brain is too slow to respond in these situations. And I'm honestly really concerned. And whilst I am the senior and she'll answer to me, that means nothing when all the guys like her so much. I can't compete with that. My adhd inhibits me socially and I can seem weird to people. I'm not cool, I'm a worker bee. From what I know of her, she's a Queen Bee. I've never learned how to stand behind my knowledge. I've always been a pleaser. I also get confused easy and forget things too. I have no idea what the guys have told her about me. I feel like my perfect job is going to turn to crap. How can I prepare my adhd brain for any contingency?

1k2m8ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancun/comments/1k2m8ct/review_royal_sands/,Review: Royal Sands,"Just got back from a 5 day trip. If you have teenagers, this is the place for you! We traveled with our 16 year old son and 14 year old daughter. They are too old to share a bed anymore, and husband and I really wanted our own space too. However, we were having a hard time finding a nice resort that had more than two beds in a room within our price range (under 4500K for AI), until we found Royal Sands. We stayed in a one-bedroom ocean view suite. The bedroom had a king, and the living room had two Murphy beds that pulled down from the entertainment center. Perfect for us! It also had a *humongous* balcony overlooking the pool and ocean (not completely ocean-facing and we were fine with that) that we spent a lot of time on. The kitchen area was very well stocked‚Ä¶honestly, I could have cooked full meals there without an issue. Full fridge, oven, stove, coffeemaker, dishes, plates, glassware, you name it, they had it. Fridge was stocked with water, soda, and beer on arrival, and replenished every day. 

The property also has a full-on grocery store that has pretty much everything you could possibly want. Snacks, alcohol, dairy, coffee, suntan lotion, water shoes, and even a small farmacia. 

Very large pool with shallow, cordoned-off area for small kids. There is also another ‚Äúquiet‚Äù pool for adults. Both pools have swim-up bars. Drink service at the pool was very attentive. Slightly less so on the beach, but we still didn‚Äôt have to wait too long until someone came around.

Beach was spectacular. Water was that gorgeous Caribbean blue. Loads of palapas (the huts with straw roofs) with loungers underneath. One thing that I liked was that we were able to find four loungers together at both the beach and the pool even without going down early to stake out a spot. On two of the days we were there, we found an open palapa even around noon. The resort has a system where you can reserve your loungers with little flags they give you with your room number on it. If you put your flags down early and then disappear for more than a couple of hours, they will pick up your flags. I think this was a good system and allowed people who don‚Äôt get up at 5 AM a chance at spots at the pool and beach. We never had too much trouble finding spots no matter the time of day. This was a refreshing change from Moon Palace, where staking out your spot is like Thunderdome. 

There is also a playground and a small water park with a couple of waterslides for kids, but we didn‚Äôt do those. My teenagers apparently think they‚Äôre too cool for waterslides now ü§£ and the area was geared for younger kids, with a splash pad and dumpy bucket, etc. 

The food was decent for all-inclusive. Better than at Moon Palace, where we stayed in January 2024. There‚Äôs a buffet, a Japanese place, a sports bar (my son was in heaven there), an upscale place called Club Bistro, and a Mexican place called Hacienda Sisal that had a dinner show. We did not do the Mexican place because we ran out of time, and we could never get into Club Bistro, even with the help of the concierge. You can only make day-of reservations if you‚Äôre not a timeshare member, and we found that most of the reservations were taken by members almost every day. Kind of a bummer but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. The buffet was fine for breakfast. For dinner it‚Äôs a menu and not a buffet, and we found that the menu items were actually pretty good. We ate there for dinner twice. 

There are some activities on site, but not that many. Mainly things like yoga, beach volleyball, and water aerobics. However,  Thomas More Travel has an office there with very kind of excursion you could imagine. We booked parasailing with them and it was handled very well. We booked some other excursions separately, before we got there. We also booked airport transportation with Thomas More and it went great. 

Nightlife ‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt much. If you want to party at night, you‚Äôll definitely need to go off-property. This was fine by us since we had the kids there. 16 wished there was something a little more at night for teenagers, but he didn‚Äôt find it to be a dealbreaker, and we got by at night with movies and card games. 

We paid about 4500 for 5 days and I definitely feel like we got our money‚Äôs worth. It was about 800 dollars more than its sister resort, the Royal Cancun Suites, but you get *so much more* bang for your buck. 

TL;DR; if you have kids and want to show them a fantastic time in Cancun in a great room at a reasonable price, this is your place. Would also recommend for older adults with no kids. Happy to answer questions in the comments! ",2,1745030174.0,cancun,1,1.0,False

They also had the option to add coffee to your soda. Once you put together a drink, it would tell you things like whether it was heavy, medium, or light on caffeine, sugar, etc. I can't remember the name of this place, and every Google search I've tried has been useless.

So this one requires a bit of a back story.  I had this friend ""Emma"" (32F). We met in university and were very close. Over the years we moved away from each other and in my (32F) mind we were still good. Talking most days via text, she would be the first person I would go to about anything in my life. It wasn't perfect but she was more than a best friend to me, she was my sister. Chosen family. 

Well the last few years we drifted apart. At this point we had been friends for 13 years so I assumed it was just life happening but we would figure it out eventually, get back to our normal stride. Anyways, about 1 year ago, we finally talked on the phone and aired everything out. She had brought up issues from 5+ years ago that I had no idea were issues to her. I was willing to try and work through it but she need separation & said she was done. 

Fast forward to now. It's been almost a year during that convo and I still miss our friendship. There are things that pop up in my life that I want to send her. Recently went on a trip to our old university (for work) and I just spent the evening crying because I wanted to call her. Now I am going to go to the city she lives in (it is quite a distance from where I live, 6+ hour drive) for an unrelated reason to her but I am thinking about reaching out to see if she wants to grab a coffee or something to catch up. 

Should I reach out? I haven't heard from her all this time so do I bother? It's her birthday soon (June) so I was thinking of reaching out with a short birthday wish and mentioning it. 

I am not sure what I should do and could use some advice. ",1,1745030010.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs an adaptation of the sauce I‚Äôve used to make sticky rice, and I didn‚Äôt have fresh mangoes available today. But this sauce was a hit. It could be used on ice cream, french toast, or an alternative to mango sticky rice. 

The base sticky rice sauce I‚Äôve used is 
1 can of coconut cream, 
1/4-1/3 cup of sugar (you may want use closer to 1/4c),
and 1/2tsp salt. 
Medium heat in a pot, melt and dissolve together. 

To this, I‚Äôve added:
-1 packet of instant coffee.
-Cinnamon (to taste)

Turn the heat to low and stir while adding:
-1/4c chocolate
-4tbsp peanut butter powder (PB2)
Keep stirring. 

If you are making sticky rice, add half the mixture to your rice before proceeding. 

Cornstarch slurry: 
Dissolve cornstarch into water at a 1:3 ratio. If you‚Äôve already used half the sauce in the last step, use 1/2tsp corn starch. Else use a teaspoon. 
Mix the slurry into the sauce and stir until desired consistency. 

This would be good with bananas or strawberries.

This is our non-recurring mostly ""wants"" and a couple ""needs"". 

$24k is distributed below. Does this look ok/reasonable for our situation?

I am thinking we should save more aggressively and only use $12k or $18k a year for the items below (saving additional $6-$12k/yr, paying down student loans faster, freeing up more money to invest in the future, having even more stability).

Partner thinks that we are already hitting all our goals as is (maxing 401k, having a good emergency fund, allocating 25% of net income to savings/debt re-payment, etc.) and thinks we work hard so we can enjoy life. 

This is the budget we have for the ""discretionary"" $24k to use on non-recurring items, most wants and some needs:

Monthly:
1- House Items $50 (lightbulb, wall art, water filter).

2- Shoes/clothes $150 (for 2 adults and 2 kids).

3- Books/educational/toys/games $100.

4- Personal care $120 (haircut, ""fancy"" care items).

5- Food out $420 (coffee, fast food, restaurants).

5- Fees $2,500 (tax preparation fee, HOA, etc).

6- Holidays $1,500  (Halloween costumes, thanksgiving dinner, Christmas tree and presents).

Episode 11: Who Can You Trust?

""Last time, on Total Drama Island! Things really got cooking between the campers!‚Äù

‚ÄúHeather pushed her team too far in the cook-off challenge and ended up one chilly mama. Owen had a hard day. Vito led the Killer Bass to victory. And after he let his appetite get to him, it was buh-bye, Owen.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill the Gophers ever be able to come back from behind? And just how much trust do they have in one another? Find out this week on Total! Drama! Island!""

(Theme Song)

A close-up of an empty meal tray opened the episode, and Chef's arm was shown dropping a scoop of a pale orange something with the consistency of mashed potatoes onto it. ""Today's breakfast,"" Chef announced as he stuck a straw into the pile, ""is French-Italian fusion casserole!""

The camera pulled back to show Cody taking the tray. ""You mean leftovers from the cooking challenge?‚Äù he said.

""Yeah, that's right!"" Chef shouted. ""You got a problem with that?!""

""Sir, no sir!"" Cody saluted the cook, and he saluted back at him.

Cody then headed to the Gophers' table, where Heather was feeling sick due to being locked up in a freezer. She had a blanket wrapped around her, and was shaking and sneezing.

""You're more chilly than usual,"" Cody quipped as he sat down.

""You're so funny,"" Heather said dryly. ""You all think that you can just lock me up in a freezer and get away with it? I am gonna make you sorry that you ever met me.‚Äù

""I already am,"" Cody said smugly.

""You are such a... a... a... achoo!"" Heather spat out her sneeze. ""Ugh! I hate this place!‚Äù

Over at the Bass table, Ella chewed some of her breakfast and spit it in her pet rabbit's mouth, and Ezekiel looked at her funny.

Meanwhile, Duncan was getting himself a mug of coffee and placed it on his tray. He looked around before stuffing another mug under his shirt. He began walking away, only to come face-to-face with Sadie.

""I saw that,"" Sadie said. ""Why would you steal a mug?""

""'Cause it's cool looking and I don't have one. Didn't have one, that is,"" Duncan said.

""And you aren't worried about getting kicked off?"" Sadie questioned.

""We've been kicking the Gophers‚Äô butts for a long time,"" Duncan chuckled as he walked away. ‚ÄúThere's nothing to worry about.‚Äù

Sadie let out a sigh before going to sit down.

Confessional: Sadie

‚ÄúI can't believe that Duncan, of all people, is the person I've talked to the most after Katie,‚Äù Sadie mentioned. ‚ÄúEven though I don't hate his guts, I'm not exactly calling him a friend too.‚Äù

An emotional tune began as the scene changed to the forest, and Chris walked into view with a frown on his face. ""Hi,"" he began sadly, ""Chris here. Sometimes teams just don't get along! So the producers and I thought that the best way to work through the group friction would be‚Ä¶ to exploit it for laughs!"" he changed his frown into a grin. ""This is gonna be awesome!""

The two teams were shown lined up along the docks. ""So!"" Chris began. ""Last week's challenge exposed a few Gopher issues,"" Heather was shown glaring at Cody, and the geek returned it as well, ""and I'm sensing a little something funky floating in the Bass pond too!"" Duncan and Sadie shot each other weird looks.

""So,"" the host continued, ""this week's challenge is gonna be centered around building trust, because,"" Chris grinned, ""all good things begin with a little trust!""

Confessional: Mike

""Ironically, I don't trust myself to keep my personalities in control at all times,"" Mike claimed.

""There will be three major challenges that have to be completed by two members of your team,"" Chris explained. ""Normally, we like to have the campers choose their partners,"" he said with laughter, ""but not this time! More fun for me!""

The footage skipped ahead as the campers were shown looking up a cliff. ""Okay!"" Chris began. ""So for the first challenge, you'll be doing an extreme freehand rock-climbing adventure! Duncan and Ella will play for the Bass,"" Chris announced, ""Cody and Heather for the Gophers.""

""Here's your belay and harness!"" Chris threw the equipment. Cody was about to catch them, but Heather stepped in front of him and did the deed for him.

‚ÄúWhat's your problem?‚Äù Cody huffed.

""If you think I'm letting you hold me up, you're nuts!"" Heather told him.

""You won't be holding him up exactly,"" Chris interjected. ""One camper pulls the slack through the belay as their partner climbs,"" he explained. ""If the climber falls, the belay will stop them from crashing."" He demonstrated by pulling the rope through the belay and throwing the slack to Duncan, who was shown pulling it.

""The catch?"" Chris continued. ""Both the side and the base of the mountain are rigged with a few minor distractions like rusty nails, slippery oil slicks, mild explosives, and a few other surprises.""

""Wicked,"" Harold said in excitement.

""The person on belay must also harness their partner up,"" Chris said as Ella and Duncan gave each other a nod while Heather and Cody simply glared at each other. ""It's all about trust, people, and, remember, never let go of the rope! Your partner's life depends on it!""

""If that is the case,"" Cody said, ""I want a new partner.""

""Please,"" Heather disregarded. ""As much as I ‚Äúlove‚Äù your company, I'm not gonna throw a challenge just to kill you. Yet. Now spread 'em.""

""I've never tried this before,"" Ella said as Duncan began to secure her. ""Have you?""

‚ÄúOh yeah,‚Äù Duncan said. ‚ÄúThey teach you how to climb walls in prison all the time.‚Äù

Ella's rabbit then popped out from behind Ella. ""I'm sorry, Cinder,"" she said. ""You can't come up with me. You can trust Mike though. Mike.‚Äù She gave her rabbit to the comedian. ‚ÄúCan you hold Cinder for now?""

""Okay,"" Mike agreed and looked down at the rabbit. ""She is pretty adorable.""

""There. You're all hooked up,"" Heather finished strapping the climbing gear on Cody.

Cody noticed another rope on him. ""What's the second rope for?"" the geek grew curious.

""It's a backup line,"" Heather explained.

""What are you smiling about?"" Cody asked suspiciously.

""Nothing. I'm just really happy we got on this challenge together,"" Heather sweetly said.

""It's all his fault for messing with me,"" Heather began her confessional vengefully. ""I have got a doctorate in revenge and humiliation.‚Äù

The footage cut back to a close-up of a patch of nails just as Ella grabbed on to a ledge between them. The viewpoint shifted to show Ella and Cody slowly making their way up the cliff, Cody in a slight lead.

Suddenly, an explosion detonated above the climbing campers, and another explosion occurred in front of Cody, sending the boy flying backwards.

The camera cut to Heather, who immediately pulled the rope and stopped her partner from falling. ""It's okay, I've got you!"" she called out.

""I promised surprises!"" Chris said as he showed a large water gun. ""Haba√±ero pepper sauce, anyone?""

The host fired out red sauce, and Heather was the first to get hit by it. ""What the heck, Chris?!"" Heather cried out, letting go of the rope to wipe off the sauce from her face, accidentally plummeting Cody back down to the ground.

""Muy caliente!"" Chris said with a flashing smile. He shot another stream at Duncan, but the camper wore sunglasses to shield his eyes from the sauce and even drank some in the process.

‚ÄúIs that the best you can do?‚Äù Duncan told Chris.

Chris frowned at the camera. ""Is that the best we can do?"" he said in a whisper.

Cody was quickly catching up to his opponent. He got around each of the obstacles and passed Ella.

""Come one, Cody,"" Heather called out. ""You don't want to fall behind."" The queen bee pulled the second rope, which ripped Cody's pants off, exposing his white underwear with yellow polka dots for everyone to see.

Cody yelped, and his ripped pants fell onto Ella's face.

""You hate to see that happen,"" Duncan said with a wince.

""So true, my man,"" Chris said, also wincing. ""So true.""

Ella removed the ripped pants from her face, and to her embarrassment, is staring at Cody's underwear. This caused her to lose her grip and scream all the way down.

Duncan yelped, having been pulled up by the rope, and he and Ella were now both hanging upside down together. ""This sucks,"" the punk groaned.

""How devastating,"" Ella agreed.

""Forget it,"" Cody held his pants with his teeth and resumed climbing, and he made it to the top of the cliff without any more issues.

""Looks like the Gophers have won the first challenge!"" Chris announced.

""Woo!"" Cody cheered in victory.

A pair of lights came on in the Mess Hall, illuminating a podium standing between the two tables. A third spotlight came on in the center, and the opposing pairs rose into either side as if they were being raised mechanically: Brick and Lindsay for the Gophers, then Ezekiel and Mike for the Bass. An unnamed white male somersaulted through the air and landed behind the podium. Seconds after the landing, Chris popped up from behind it as though he had done the stunt himself. He crossed his arms and grinned at the camera.

""And now round two!"" Chris announced. ""The Extreme! Cooking! Chal-lenge!"" The unnamed man crawled out in the background, heading into the kitchen as the four teens watched. ""Each team must choose who cooks and who eats.""

""You were Head Chef last time eh,"" Ezekiel said to Mike. ""I'll cook.""

‚ÄúOkay, and can I borrow your hat for a while?‚Äù Mike asked the homeschooler.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Ezekiel wondered.

‚ÄúI know you don't like him, but we might need him for this part of the challenge,‚Äù Mike answered.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Ezekiel allowed, and Mike removed his toque and placed it on his head, gasping into Manitoba Smith.

‚ÄúIf what you're cooking is deadly, I won't eat it,‚Äù Manitoba told Ezekiel. ‚ÄúYou got that?‚Äù

""Ooh, Brock! I'll be the cook!"" Lindsay said to Brick.

""I'm not experienced in cooking, so have at it,"" Brick agreed.

""Today you'll be preparing fugu sashimi,"" Chris announced, ""the traditional Japanese poisonous blowfish."" Chef wheeled a cart into the scene, on top of which sat a tank with two trembling and wide-eyed blowfish inside.

A gong sounded, rattling Lindsay and Brick before a short Japanese tune played in the background. A rough diagram of where to cut the fish was projected onto the wall next to the host, who picked up a pointer to assist in his explanation. ""The fugu blowfish contains enough lethal toxin to kill thirty people,"" Chris said. Chef tapped the side of the tank with a fish scoop, causing the two blowfish to puff up.

""Fishies,"" Chef said, picking up the fish by their tails, ""meet your maker!"" He tossed them onto the cutting boards on the tables in front of Brick and Manitoba, who looked at them warily.

""They must be sliced very carefully,"" Chris told them, ""to cut around the poisonous organs."" Lindsay poked the fish with a knife, and Manitoba looked suspicious. ""The poison paralyzes the nerves, and,"" Chris grinned darkly in a close-up, ""there is no antidote!"" His tone became lighter as he finished, ""So no worries!""

Brick took a worried peek at Lindsay. ""You have taken biology, right?""

Lindsay answered with a nod.

‚ÄúBegin!‚Äù Chris announced.

Lindsay jabbed the fish with her knife, causing it to rapidly deflate and fly around the room. The two watched as it shot through a window and shattered it.

A stack of sashimi rolls on a plate was shown, and Ezekiel placed a sprig of parsley on top. ""Finished!"" he said.

From across the room, Lindsay had made a pile of pink mush and put a smiley face on it with ketchup.

Ezekiel pushed the plate over to Manitoba, who picked up a piece and inspected it. Chris and Chef were shown watching with anticipation as the Australian personality slowly put the piece of fish into his mouth, chewed it, and swallowed. He looked around and grinned, giving a thumbs up.

Chris and Chef looked over at the other team as Lindsay shoved her plate in front of Brick. ""Ta-da!"" she said.

The camera focused on the vague lump of fish on the plate. Brick stabbed a piece with his fork and stuck it into his mouth in order to chew through it.

Brick was silent at first... until he suddenly started slapping his head and screamed. The cadet chuckled, but soon his stomach started gurgling and he fell to the floor, his skin turning blue.

""You said you passed biology!"" Brick said in a slurred voice as he had his hand on the table.

""I said I took biology,"" Lindsay reaffirmed. Brick fell again and was now lying on the floor, twitching and vomiting about, the vomit starting to spread. ‚ÄúEww!‚Äù Lindsay complained.

""It's cool,"" Chris told the teens as Ezekiel and Manitoba came over to see. ""Give him twenty-four hours and he'll be up walking and breathing good as new.""

""Is anyone gonna help this fella?"" Manitoba asked in bewilderment. Brick was shown in the midst of another spasm as Chef ‚Äì dressed in a nurse's uniform ‚Äì leaned in to give him mouth-to-mouth. He gurgled in horrified disgust as the scene faded to black.

(Commercial Break)

The sun was shown high in the sky before the camera panned down and out. Mike and Ezekiel were running across the docks together, smiles on their faces.

""Last one in's a rotten egg!"" Ezekiel said, taking the lead and flinging himself into the lake.

""Wait, I just have to make sure Cinder's safe!"" Mike put her on a lifeguard chair. He then jumped into the lake, and he surfaced next to Ezekiel.

""I was surprised that you managed to eat that fish, eh,"" Ezekiel said to Mike.

""It was Manitoba technically, but even if it wasn't him, I would still trust you,"" Mike told the prairie boy before swimming off laughing, and Ezekiel gave chase.

Brick was shown lying on a bed next to some medical equipment, still clearly afflicted by the blowfish he'd eaten. A small puddle of vomit had already formed under his head, and he was making alarmed gurgling noises. Chef, in his nurse's uniform, smirked as he looked between his and a large needle filled with a purple liquid. ""This won't hurt a bit,"" he told him with a tap of the needle before a malicious smirk formed on his face. ""It'll hurt a whole lot.""

Meanwhile, Ezekiel and Mike had just come out of the water and were drying themselves off when Mike noticed a snake that had slithered to where Cinder was and gasped.

""Get away from that rabbit!"" Ezekiel ran to save Cinder, but the snake swallowed her. The homeschooled boy tried to grab the snake, but an eagle swooped down and carried it off.

‚ÄúGrab the eagle!‚Äù Mike pointed at the animal who had just landed at the end of the dock.

‚ÄúYou don't have to tell me twice,‚Äù Ezekiel rushed forward, but a shark rose up and ate the eagle, snake, and Cinder.

Mike inhaled into Chester. ""Stupid animals!‚Äù he stomped his foot in frustration.

""Good news!"" Chris announced as the camera showed the remaining members of both teams lined up before the host. ""The third round involves three more challenges! It's the Three Blind Challenges!"" He held up three fingers. ""It begins with the Blind William Tell, followed by the Blind Trapeze, and culminating in the treacherous Blind Toboggan.""

""Mike, where's Cinder?"" Ella whispered to Mike.

""Cinder? Uh, I'll go get her now,"" Mike darted away.

Chris then gave Ezekiel a pair of shades similar to what was used during the paintball challenge, then placed an arrow on top of the boy's head. ""Like legendary marksman William Tell,"" Chris explained as he went to stand by a barrel of apples some distance away, ""you'll be knocking arrows off your partner's head with crab apples.""

""Actually,"" Ezekiel corrected, ""it‚Äôs the other way around, ya knob.""

""Shush!"" Chris interrupted. ""Also,"" he showed them a white cloth, ""the shooter will be blindfolded! The person who knocks off the arrow,"" the blindfolded host explained, readying a slingshot, ""wins."" Chris let loose the apple, which hit Ezekiel in the crotch. He fell to his knees and groaned.

""Ahh, nuts!"" Chris said, peeking out from his blindfold. ""Sky and Dawn, you'll be one team,"" he said as the two Gophers smiled at each other, ""Harold and Shawn, you'll be the other.""

‚ÄúI'm violently allergic to apples,‚Äù Harold said.

‚ÄúOoh, let me shoot! I'm a good shot!‚Äù Sadie offered.

Shawn sighed. ‚ÄúI hope so.‚Äù

""Okay!"" Chris said. ""Let's rock and roll!""

The scene cut to Dawn and Shawn with safety glasses and arrows on their heads. Across the clearing stood Sky and Sadie, already blindfolded, while Chris and the other campers stood to the side. Both shooters shot their first apples, and it hit their teammates‚Äô chests. The shooters made their second shots, and once again, their partners got hit in the chest.

Several more apples were shown hitting the two targets, and while Dawn braved through them all, Shawn was shown to be wincing at every shot.

Eventually, Sky let one more apple fly, and it went straight onto the arrow, making it fall off Dawn‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúNice job,‚Äù the moonchild congratulated the athlete.

Sky took a peek out of her blindfold. ‚ÄúYes! I hit the arrow!‚Äù she cheered.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got him this time,‚Äù Sadie steeled herself as she prepared to shoot another arrow.

‚ÄúSky won already!"" Chris yelled.

""Sadie, you can stop-!"" Shawn attempted to halt her only to get hit in the groin and forehead hard.

Chris stood in front of Sadie and held her shoulders. ‚ÄúSadie, it‚Äôs over, man! Let it go!‚Äù the host cried out as he shook her to her senses.

Sadie took off her blindfold. ‚ÄúOopsie. Sorry,‚Äù she apologized to Shawn, who was too unconscious to speak before falling down.

The next part of the challenge had the host and campers, without Shawn, assembled behind a tall wooden structure suspended over a pool of water. Going up the two front posts were rungs that could be used to climb to a small platform, and hanging over the gap in the middle were two trapezes.

""And now,"" Chris announced, ""the Blind Trapeze! To avoid serious injury, the trapeze has been set up over this pond, which is full of jellyfish!"" A school of pinkish-purple jellyfish crackling with electricity was shown, and the Killer Bass gasped.

""You two,"" Chris said as he tossed blindfolds to Ezekiel and Heather, ""will stand blindfolded on the platform until your partners tell you when to jump."" The two looked at their assigned partners Harold and Lindsay.

""And then?"" Heather asked.

""Then hopefully they'll catch you,"" Chris told her. ""Or that's gonna be one heck of a painful swim. Okay, hut hut!""

Ella walked up to Mike. ""So, do you have Cinder?"" she asked.

""Uh... I‚Ä¶ I put her in the... And then there were..."" Mike stammered and Ella started to tear up. ""I'm not sure where she is. Sorry.""

""It's not your fault. I just want to be alone for the time being,‚Äù Ella told him and distanced herself from her team.

Mike frowned with guilt, and Duncan saw this and walked off.

The scene skipped ahead to show the two blindfolded contestants and jumpers at their stations, Harold hanging from his knees from the Bass' trapeze, and Lindsay next to her teammate on the Gophers' platform.

""Okay, Ezekiel! Jump now!"" Harold said while swinging, but Ezekiel stood still out of fear. ""If we're going to win, you've got to trust me!""

""Okay! Next time!"" Ezekiel said.

""Okay. One..."" Harold called out slowly. ""Two...three!"" Ezekiel gulped but took the leap, and his partner caught him easily. As the two swung over the pond, the Bass cheered.

""Okay Gophers, your turn!"" Chris continued with a smile.

Lindsay was now on the Bass‚Äô trapeze. ""Okay!"" she called as she swung back and forth. ""One! Two! Three! Jump! No, oh, no, not yet!""

But Heather leaped off the platform, and she missed catching Lindsay. The queen bee plunged into the pond, sending up a wave of water and jellyfish. Her screams and the sound of stinging filled the air as her team looked on in concern.

Confessional: Cody

""Those jellyfish have to sting pretty badly,"" Cody confessed uncomfortably.

Confessional Ends

The footage cut back to the infirmary. A scream followed by the sound of an electric shock was heard as Heather entered the tent, a jellyfish still clinging to her. ""I can't believe I trusted that little-‚Äù she got zapped mid-sentence. ‚ÄúFreaking stinging jellyfish!‚Äù

Heather took a seat on one of the beds, and noticed Shawn waking up. ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù he observed his surroundings.

‚ÄúYou're in the infirmary,‚Äù Heather said and turned to Chef. ""Got anything for removing jellyfish?"" she wondered before getting zapped again.

Shawn went back to lying down until he saw Duncan leading a rabbit towards him with a carrot while he was walking backwards.

A pair of toboggans leaning against a tree had caught the eyes of the remaining campers as Chris began to explain the final challenge. ""And now, the final leg!"" he said grandly. ""The Blind Toboggan Race!""

""Say what?"" Sky said in confusion.

""Each team will have a driver, and a navigator,"" Chris explained. ""The driver steers, while the navigator shouts directions. Oh yeah! And the driver will be blindfolded!"" This made the teens gasp.

""Not many of you left,"" Chris noted as he looked over the remaining campers. ""Keep losing you guys!"" He laughed. ""Oh well. Uh...Sky and Cody, Ella and Mike.""

The non-competitors were briefly shown standing behind the finish line as the camera panned over to the highest cliff in the area. ""I know you're upset about Cinder,"" Mike said while looking at the course, ""but we have to focus on the challenge.""

""Cinder left me,"" Ella sadly brought up. ""And without even saying goodbye.""

""I'm really sorry, but we can't die right now,"" Mike pointed out.

They looked over at Chef, who was brushing something oily onto the bottoms of the toboggans. ""Just lubing 'em up,"" he said with a smirk. ""Get a little more speed going."" This got Mike and Ella worried.

The footage cut to Chef and Chris standing over the Gopher duo on their toboggan, Sky having donned the blindfold. ""On your marks!"" Chris said as he walked over to the Bass, showing Ella blind in front with Mike behind her. ""Get set!"" He put his foot on the edge of the Bass' toboggan, and took out an airhorn. The shot zoomed out to reveal Chef with his foot on the Gophers' toboggan, and as the host blew the horn, the two men gave the teens a push.

The music became fast-paced and hectic as Cody and Sky sped down the hillside. ""Left! Right!"" Cody called, Sky moving the toboggan according to the directions. The two passed behind a large tree, allowing the footage to move to the other team.

""Watch out for the tree!"" Mike warned, and Ella leaned the other way. As they sped off, the camera showed Sky and Cody hitting a sloped rock.

""Are we flying?!"" Sky panicked as the two ramped into the air.

""Would you feel better if I said we weren't?"" Cody said in worry. A splash was heard, and the Gopher duo were shown to have landed on the river. They quickly went over a waterfall, hitting a log lodged between two rocks and springing back into the air.

The Bass duo were shown again. ‚ÄúElla! I really need you to steer! Cinder would want you to live!‚Äù Mike encouraged.

""Hey Ella! Look who I found?!"" Duncan cried out, revealing the rabbit in his hands.

""Ella!"" Mike said. ""Duncan found Cinder!""

""Cinder's back?! Hooray!"" Ella cheered. ""Let us finish this race!""

""Left! Right!"" Mike directed. As they raced down the hill, they saw Cody and Sky landing ahead of them.

""Right!"" Cody said as they sped past the trees. ""Left!""

""Right!"" Mike said before being alarmed. ""Left!"" Suddenly, an explosion went off just to the left of their path.

""What was that?!"" Ella asked in a panic.

The scene cut to Chris, holding a blasting machine, smiling as he presses the plunger. ""We had a few explosives left over,"" he explained to the camera, ""and I'd just hate to waste.""

Chris detonated more explosions, and the two teams were shown dodging the blasts, until another one hit close to the Bass and sent them flying off, much to Cody's surprise.

At the finish line, Lindsay was cheering while the Bass were looking stunned. The cheering then stopped as they saw Ella and Mike landing on the tape after their flight, breaking it and winning the challenge with Cody and Sky coming in after.

The Bass cheered and went to congratulate Mike and Ella. Ella removed her blindfold and grabbed the rabbit from Duncan.

""Thanks, Duncan,"" she said. ""I owe a lot to you.""

""Whatever. It's just a stupid rabbit,"" Duncan scoffed.

""I can't believe you found Ella's bunny,‚Äù Sadie smiled at the delinquent. ‚ÄúYou're actually pretty nice.""

""What? No I'm not,"" Duncan quickly denied.

""Then why did you go out of your way to find the bunny when you didn't have to?"" Sadie asked.

""Whatever! She wouldn't leave me alone! Weird rabbit!"" Duncan kept on denying.

‚ÄúI am smarter than I look,‚Äù Sadie said with a teasing grin.

""Okay, fine, I did it. Are you happy now?‚Äù Duncan confessed. ‚ÄúListen, don't tell anybody, okay? I don't want 'em to think I'm soft or anything.""

""I'm good at keeping secrets. Don't worry,"" Sadie reassured with a wink.

Confessional: Duncan

""I'm not nice, okay?"" Duncan said firmly to the camera with a threatening look on his face. ""Just to set the record straight.‚Äù

Confessional Ends

The camera panned over the campers, Brick, Heather, and Shawn back with their teams. Heather had a few adhesive bandages on her face but looked fine, while Brick was confined to a wheelchair Chef was holding and still gurgled every now and then.

""And the Bass are the winners of the toboggan race!"" Chris announced, and the Bass cheered and celebrated their win.

The scene shifted to nighttime as the elimination began, the camera panning from the six members of the Screaming Gophers to Chris and his plate of marshmallows. ""Who wants a treat?"" he opened. ""A tasty goody that represents exemption, security, peace of mind-""

He was interrupted by Cody. ""Can you speed it up a little?""

Chris immediately popped up behind Lindsay and sped up his speech. ""And if you don't get a marshmallow, you have to walk the Dock of Shame and you can never come back!"" He ducked behind Lindsay and showed back up close to Cody's face. ""Ever!""

""Let's see...one for Cody, one for Dawn, one for Sky, one for Lindsay!"" He tossed four of the marshmallows across the fire, and Cody, Dawn, Sky, and Lindsay happily caught them in their mouths.

""Looks like we only have one left,"" Chris said as the view moved to the remaining campers. ""Heather and Brick,"" the former looked nervous and the latter had no response since he was still in his wheelchair and not recovered, ""the final marshmallow.""

Confessional: Cody

‚ÄúBrick's not in good condition right now, so we had to vote for him rather than Heather for his own sake,‚Äù Cody grumbled before changing his mood. ‚ÄúThough I did find a way to give Dawn some alone time with Brick.‚Äù

Confessional Ends

""Are you going to give the marshmallow or what?"" Heather asked.

""Don't rush me!"" Chris protested. ""The audience eats up this kind of dramatic conclusion!""

‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù Heather huffed.

""...Heather,"" Chris gave the marshmallow to Heather, who received it with her hands.

""Brick, the Dock of Shame awaits, bro,"" Chris told the wheelchair-bound boy. ""I guess we can help you get there.""

""I'll do it!"" Dawn volunteered and began pushing Brick to the dock.

""Bye, Brick!"" Sky said.

""Get well soon!"" Cody waved.

The shot cut to Dawn and Brick at the dock.

""It's a shame that you have to leave this early, but it is for your own good,"" Dawn gave off an apology, and Brick could only gurgle in response.

‚ÄúEven though we haven't had a lot of moments together, I still cherish them, and I know you do as well,‚Äù she continued.

The Boat of Losers arrived, and Dawn gave Brick a peck on his cheek before placing him on it. ""Hopefully you get a safe recovery. Farewell,"" Dawn said goodbye to Brick as the boat drove him away.

I‚Äôve been an Arsenal fan since I was 11, because my youth team was called The Arsenal. Got lucky‚Äîour coach could‚Äôve named us the Spurs, but he was a wise old bastard and called us The Arsenal. Best three years of my youth career. I‚Äôd follow that man into the gates of hell if he called me tonight.

The club‚Äôs always meant something to me. But two years ago, my son was born‚Äîand everything changed. My wife and I went through as complicated a pregnancy, birth, and post-birth stretch as anyone can imagine. Everyone ended up alive and healthy, but it was a war. My job, you ask? Let my wife recover and handle everything else. That meant 11 pm, 2 am, 6 am wakeups. Feed the baby. Make the formula. Brew coffee. Get my shit together for work. Morning were my time to be a husband. Weekends became my time to be Dad.

I didn‚Äôt love it at first. It was hard‚Äîexhausting, crushing at times. Then the Premier League season started a few months after he was born. And let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîthere‚Äôs not much else on at 6 am. So it became our thing: formula, change a poppy diaper, coffee, and The Arsenal.

I got him a bruised banana jersey. Two boys, sharing something that was probably the first part of my legacy to him. He‚Äôs almost two now‚Äîand he‚Äôs into it. He claps, he shouts, still shits his pants (who didn‚Äôt after Declan‚Äôs banger). But after the Madrid game, it hit me: he doesn‚Äôt care about Arsenal. He cares about being his father‚Äôs son. It‚Äôs about time with his dad. He sees something that matters to me, so it matters to him too. I‚Äôm his. He‚Äôs mine. 

Isn‚Äôt that the whole point of this club? A place you belong. Something you share. Something you pass on to those who belong to you.

These last two years‚Äîwatching the team grow, the young guys step up‚ÄîI‚Äôve never been prouder. Of them. Of myself. Of my son. I‚Äôm still figuring this whole dad thing out, but I know one thing- the bond‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs being forged everyday, but The Arsenal is a critical piece of it. From early morning Gunners to the rest of the day ahead.

We‚Äôre gonna win the league soon. Maybe even the Champions League this year. But no doubt‚Äîthis is my club. It‚Äôll be his too. It‚Äôs ours.

And thank fucking God our coach named us The Arsenal. Because I could‚Äôve ended up some cunt watching Bruno Fernandes flop around or supporting the spuds. 

Here‚Äôs to being lucky. Here‚Äôs to being a Gooner.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cleveland Guardians, two teams that have been flirting with mediocrity like it's a high school crush. As they prepare to face off at PNC Park, the Pirates are hoping their bobblehead giveaway night will distract fans from their .197 team batting average. Meanwhile, the Guardians are hoping to shake off their recent series loss to the Orioles and prove that they can win more than just three games as underdogs.

The Pirates have Paul Skenes on the mound, who is as reliable as your morning coffee with a 2.96 ERA. On the other side, the Guardians are sending out Ben Lively, whose 4.87 ERA suggests he's been anything but lively on the mound this season.

Now, let's talk odds. The Pirates are favored with a moneyline of 1.56, which is about as exciting as watching paint dry. The Guardians, on the other hand, are the underdogs with a tempting price of 2.5. Given the Pirates' struggles with the long ball and their inability to hit anything that isn't a bobblehead, the Guardians might just have a fighting chance.

For the best bet, let's take a look at the totals. With the line set at 7.5 runs, and considering the Pirates' offensive struggles and the Guardians' decent lineup, the ""Under"" at 2.0 seems like a solid play. After all, this game could very well be a low-scoring affair, with both teams trying to outdo each other in the art of leaving runners stranded.

So, grab your popcorn and your bobblehead, and get ready for a game that might not be a slugfest, but will surely be a test of patience. Go with the ""Under"" and thank me later when you're cashing in your winnings.

I was on IAD-SFO flight last night. The day before, I had  cut my finger pretty deeply and thought it was healing. On the flight, I must have bumped it, and it opened up again, causing a lot of pain. I went to the galley to ask for a band aid. They couldn't find one, but the FA was concerned, and ended up getting me a band aid from her personal kit.  Later, as she was serving coffee, she recognized me (among all the Y passengers on a 787-9) and checked in to see how my finger was doing and if I needed anything else. 

Like I said, this  may not be a big deal any other day, but returning on a long night flight home from a four-day conference, that extra bit of kindness made a big difference. Thank you, Shana.

I also have a remote job, based in nyc, so I'll probably be there when I'm not here or traveling around. I'll  be gone either Tuesday and Wednesday or Wednesday and Thursday. 


What you can expect from me:

I'm very minimalistic, simple and clean (I grew up in a OCD household). I'm just looking for a place to sleep, shower, and use of a refrigerator keep my Factor meals (10 max.). I'll most likely never cook even though I do enjoy cooking! 

I'm quiet and keep to myself. When I'm not working at the airport, I'll be working out of a coffee shop for my other job. You'll rarely see me. 


My requirements: 

Walking distance (less than 10 minutes) to the blue line.

Allow me to keep my work clothes there which consist of 2-3 pants, 2-3 shirts, and a pair of boots. I don't need a closet or dresser. A storage container that I can slide under a bed will work just fine. 

Access to washer and dryer. 1-2 loads max. This would probably be a bi-weekly chore. 


About Me:

35 male. Outside of this airport job, I work in management consulting, so I tend to stay busy. I love standup comedy, DJ as a hobby (disco, funk, house, ghetto tech, techno), but i listen to just about everything. I love to travel (which is why I got this job) and am always down for a spontaneous trip somewhere, if my schedule allows it. My curiosity leans towards business and finance related topics, though I do enjoy deep conversations about life in general. 


Edit: I don't really have a budget, but given my needs and requirements, I'm really not looking to spend more than $800 per month. I will also consider daily and weekly rates. ",1,1745028682.0,chicagoapartments,0,1.0,False

So as the title suggests, I am looking to get to know someone for a chat first, and then we can see how it goes from there.

My hobbies include swimming, bowling, rock climbing, traveling, but my favorite hobby is chatting over a tea or coffee in a cafe or restaurant. I don‚Äôt drink or smoke. 
I am a blind person and I decided early in life that it wasn‚Äôt going to stop me from achieving what I wanted to achieve. I also produce my own music and have been doing so for the last 3 years. 

I am also interested in a wide variety of subjects including meteorology, sociology, psychology and language learning.

1k2lqec,https://www.reddit.com/r/santacruz/comments/1k2lqec/happily_married_female_seeking_lasting_friendship/,Happily married female seeking lasting friendship.,"I‚Äôve lived in Santa Cruz for seven years. For the last five, I‚Äôve been head-down in my marriage and career‚Äîonly to look up and realize I‚Äôm nearing 40 and feeling‚Ä¶ quietly lonely.

I‚Äôm at that weird in-between age where most women I meet are either starting families (and I don‚Äôt find any baby nearly as cute or interesting as my dog) or freshly divorced (and vanish the moment a dating app shows a match). Neither vibe works for me.

I‚Äôve also noticed that I‚Äôve curated a life of solo pursuits‚Äîpottery, gardening, baking bread, mushroom foraging (and consuming), reading, yoga, Pilates, art museums. Lovely things. But not very social.

So I‚Äôm looking for a friendship. Real, non-romantic, long-game friendship. With someone who loves good food, has a cultural appreciation for art and music, and enjoys conversations about ideas, philosophy, life stories. Bonus points if you have disposable income to travel with a friend‚Äîlong weekends or even abroad. 

A few things to know: I‚Äôm not a night owl. I prefer ap√©ro to a nightcap. I‚Äôd rather split two appetizers than get dessert. I will drive over the hill for omakase, but not to shop at Santana Row. I don‚Äôt have a Netflix account or social media, and my YouTube algorithm is tuned to KEXP radio, comedy shorts, and millennials who buy run-down chateaus in France, eat at Taiwanese night markets, and bathe at traditional Japanese onsens.

Also worth noting: I‚Äôm fiercely loyal. If someone disrespects you, I will run them over with my car. Not really. (But I might key theirs.)

And if you‚Äôre wondering, I am a 1w2, INFJ, Taurus-Taurus, fire Tiger. Personally, I am not convinced any of that actually signifies anything, but I do know I‚Äôm the friend who brings the good wine and glares at people who interrupt you.

If any of this sounds remotely like your kind of friendship, let‚Äôs exchange a few messages. If we get along, I might even wash my hair and change out of my comfy pants to meet over coffee.",5,1745028495.0,santacruz,1,0.78,False

We had spent 3.5 years together and were living together at the time. When he moved out, we decided it would be best to have a period of NC then to meet up for a coffee for closure 3 to 6 months later. 

About four months of NC later, I had an awful encounter with him. We were both in the same nightclub, and his friends spotted me. They told him that I was there, and he went on to text me to come over and say hello to him. By the time I went over (about 10 mins later), he was making out with another girl in front of me. I immediately left the club, and about 30 minutes later he continued to send me texts to come say hello to him. 

The next day, I waited to see if he would reach out to apologize for being so disrespectful. He did not, so I wrote him a lengthy message to tell him how he had treated me terribly. He responded to that message calling it ‚Äúbad timing.‚Äù

That was our last exchange, in January 2024. We have had no contact since then on social media or otherwise. For the last year and a half of NC, I have deliberated whether he was blackout drunk or not based upon how he seemed in the club that night and his lack of understanding for the gravity of what he had done to me. 

I have wanted to reach out for the last year or so, hopefully to gain closure. Mostly because I have moved cross country since then, and I have wanted to make sure that he is OK. But also it hangs over my head that I will never know if he was blackout drunk when we had the bad encounter in the club. Or if he meant to treat me that way. Him not reaching out the day after has led me to believe that he did not understand the extent of his actions. 

Recently, I had not been thinking of him much. But last week I had a vivid dream about him, and I returned to seeking ways to resolve this in my psyche. I understand that the safer option is to keep things at no contact. But I have a hard time wrapping my head around never speaking to him ever again, especially since we spent so long together & were both so young. He was my first boyfriend & we were together from ages 18-22.

One of the ways I relax from a stressful work day or life in general is watching Japanese railway videos on YouTube while having my morning coffee. The videos are wonderful and I recommend them to anyone who enjoys beautiful scenery in Japan.

Now for the question at hand.

I really want to play Densha de Go with the controller (see [link here on Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/335620398366?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=ivzjp2mesya&sssrc=4429486&ssuid=0mKrVddhR_y&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY)). I own a Playstation NTSC but the games are for NTSC-J.

How can I play these games using the controller?

My options are buying a Japanese Playstation, which seems pricey.

Modding my PS1. Which I don't know how to do. I do have a game modification add on I can plug in to the parallel I/O slot which I saw on YouTube, may be a way to circumvent the region lock on games but maybe not the controller I want to use.

I figure I would ask all of you for some guidance since I'm now hyperfixated on this goal.

\*\*Day:\*\* Friday  

\*\*Date:\*\* April 4, 2521  

\*\*Time:\*\* 06:00 AM



\---



The alarm was gentle.



No blaring, no urgency. Just the low hum of a soft chime pulsing through the air‚Äîpaired with a subtle vibration from his Bracelink, nudging him out of sleep with the grace of a morning tide.



Cael blinked once. Then again.



Light crept in through the dorm window in hazy shafts, diffused by the climate-control filters overhead. The Spire's artificial dawn had already adjusted itself to his preference‚Äî\*\*warm\*\*, golden, almost nostalgic in hue.



His bed still felt too good. Too big. Too... not-portside.



But the ache in his chest was dull today, not sharp. That was something.



He exhaled and sat up slowly, ruffling his hair and muttering something close to:



""Alright, alright... one more day of pretending I‚Äôve got this figured out.""



\---



\### ‚ú¶ Morning Routine



He padded barefoot across the cool floor, stretching as he moved, cracking his back with a quiet groan. The fridge opened with a hiss of chilled air. One cup of water down first.



Then‚Äîcoffee.



He approached \*\*Dino‚Äôs beast of a machine\*\*, lovingly installed in his kitchen like a shrine to both functionality and sibling affection. The controls lit up the second his palm hovered.



He went medium strength today. Two sugars. A splash of milk. It hissed and brewed like a sleeping dragon rousing from slumber.



The aroma? Sharp, clean, and grounding.



""Thanks, old man,"" Cael murmured toward the machine.



While it brewed, he ducked into the bathroom.



Toothbrush. Mouthwash. Rinse.



A quick shave check‚Äîstill good. Then straight into the shower. The heat came fast, wrapping him in steam and citrus-scented soap. He washed slowly, deliberately, not because he was tired‚Äîbut because he could.



No rush. No alarms.



Just warmth.



\---



By \*\*06:48 AM\*\*, he was dry, dressed, and back in the main room‚Äîmoving like he‚Äôd done this routine forever.



He grabbed clean clothes from the closet‚Äî\*\*nothing cadet-coded today\*\*. Just a \*\*baggy black hoodie\*\*, \*\*gray-white tee\*\*, \*\*loose sweatpants\*\*, and \*\*black boxers\*\* underneath. \*\*White socks\*\* slid on last, followed by his slightly-worn \*\*crocs\*\*‚Äîscuffed just enough to show they‚Äôd seen better pavement.



Last step?



He spritzed a small hit of \*\*vanilla-orange cologne\*\* on his collarbone. It wasn‚Äôt fancy. It was just \*his\*. A scent that somehow said: \*warmth, mischief, and someone who notices when you‚Äôre not okay\*.



Then came the earbuds.



The headset clicked softly into place, sealing the world out as the soft pulse of \*\*lo-fi rhythms\*\* filled his ears‚Äî\*\*muted snares, vinyl hiss, chill synth chords.\*\* Just enough bass to set a pace. Just enough melody to walk by.



\---



\### ‚ú¶ The Walk



By \*\*07:00 AM\*\*, Cael was out the door.



No agenda. No targets.



Just \*\*walking\*\*.



The Spire campus stretched ahead‚Äîwide paths edged in flowering shrubs, softly glowing markers, and \*\*weather like a dream someone programmed just for him\*\*. A little overcast. Slight breeze. Smelled faintly of cool stone and green things growing.



His feet followed instinct.



No classroom corners today. No training pits. Just the outer zones of the campus‚Äîpast the skybridge that looped around the dorm towers, through the shaded meditative garden, and into the gentle rise that led toward the reflection pools.



He didn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt speak.



He just \*\*moved\*\*.



\---



The lo-fi tune shifted‚Äîdrum taps fading into soft piano loops.



And slowly, his shoulders relaxed.



The breath that had been tight since the moment he arrived finally \*\*uncoiled\*\* in his chest. He wasn‚Äôt thinking about anyone watching. Or impressing the right professor. Or earning his keep.



Not in this moment.



In this moment, he was just \*\*Cael\*\*‚Äîa guy walking through engineered sunlight, sipping the last of his coffee, and letting the ache in his chest turn into something \*\*quiet\*\*.



He passed a pair of students near the edge of the pool‚ÄîVaelari, unbonded, engaged in polite posture drills. They nodded to him.



He nodded back.



His earbuds stayed in. His gaze drifted skyward.



Somewhere, way up past the false-sky panels and gravity rigs, stars still spun. But down here, everything was still.



Not perfect. Not easy.



But \*still\*.



\---



\### ‚ú¶ Internal Pulse



\*I‚Äôm here,\* he thought. \*I made it.\*



And in two days, everything would start for real.



The classes. The rankings. The pressure. The watching.



But for now?



He just walked.



One step after another.



Music in his ears. Scent of oranges and steel in the air.



The memory of his siblings still warm in his chest, like a handprint left after being held.



\---



\*\*09:00 AM\*\*  

The day had barely begun. But already, Cael Rowan felt something settle.



He was alive. He was moving. He was ready to keep breathing.

\*\*Day:\*\* Friday  

\*\*Date:\*\* April 4, 2521  

\*\*Time:\*\* 09:00 AM



\---



The day had barely begun.  

But already, \*\*Cael Rowan\*\* felt something settle.



He was alive.  

He was moving.  

He was ready to keep breathing.



\---



He walked without urgency, his pace set by the lo-fi hum drifting through his headset.  

Soft bass. A distant sax loop. Gentle rain layered beneath it.



One hand was tucked in his hoodie pocket. The other nursed the last of his lukewarm coffee in a travel flask. The air was mild. Trees fluttered with programmed breeze. Sky panels above shifted with subtle light tones to mimic early morning sunbreak.



His steps curved past a quiet reflection pool, down an off-path trail flanked by sculpted stone benches.



And somewhere along that path, something in his chest cracked open‚Äînot painfully. Just... soft.



A sigh escaped him.



And his mind drifted.



\---



\### ‚ú¶ The Memory Stirred



First came \*\*Bee‚Äôs voice\*\*.  

That last message last night‚Äîbright, stubborn, lovingly sharp around the edges.



Then \*\*Dino‚Äôs calm steadiness\*\*‚Äîthe slow patience in his words, like he was used to being everyone‚Äôs anchor whether they asked or not.



They would be here soon.  

But the silence now made space for something else.



\---



The sound of wind.  

The distant chirp of birds.  

The warmth of sunlight on the back of his hoodie.



And then‚Äî  

The \*Port\*.



It bled through the cracks of his thoughts like steam under a rusted grate.  

Familiar. Ugly. Loved.



\---



\### ‚ú¶ Before the Portside Three



There had been no Bee.  

No Dino.  

No nickname, no voice calling him ‚ÄúCally,‚Äù no hand on his back when the world turned too cold.



Just \*\*Cael\*\*‚Äîa kid with a name no one used, sleeping wherever the rain didn‚Äôt reach.



He remembered what \*hunger\* used to feel like before it became normal.



That gnawing, trembling ache that shook your ribs.  

How your body stopped crying for food and just... started folding in on itself.  

How he used to press his belly to the cold underside of service vents just to \*\*numb it\*\*.



\---



He remembered begging‚Äînot loud, not aggressive.



\*Soft.\*



Just standing with his hands cupped near docking stations or stairwells, waiting for someone to see him. Hoping the right person passed by before the wrong one did.



There were always \*\*three kinds of people\*\* in the port.



\---



\#### ‚ú¶ The Good



The warm-hearted ones.



The woman who handed him a half-eaten wrap and didn‚Äôt flinch when their fingers touched.  

The old man who left sealed water packets near the trash bins every morning at the same time, pretending not to notice when Cael took them.



There was a vendor once‚Äîmiddle-aged, sharp-eyed‚Äîwho didn‚Äôt say a word, just slid a full ration bar across the counter and turned away.



Small things.



But when you‚Äôre six years old and invisible?  

\*\*Small things are everything.\*\*



He remembered them all.



Every kindness.  

Every face.



Because those moments stitched him together. Kept his ribs from splintering. Kept his soul from floating off into the sky.



\---



\#### ‚ú¶ The Bad



Then there were the ones who \*\*looked\*\* at him.



Looked \*down\* at him.



People who stepped over him like he was part of the pavement.  

Who told him to get a job, as if a child had that kind of power.  

Who spat near him. Not \*at\* him‚Äîbut near enough to make the message clear.



Vendors who swatted his hand away from bins.  

Guards who barked warnings when he lingered too close to supply crates.



One time, a kid about his age threw a hot packet of noodles at him.  

Burned his hand. He didn‚Äôt even yell.



He just stood there, stunned, watching the other boy laugh and vanish into the crowd.



That night, Cael didn‚Äôt cry.  

He just curled up under a lift ramp and pretended his stomach wasn‚Äôt on fire.



\---



\#### ‚ú¶ The Ugly



And then came the ones who didn‚Äôt see a boy.



They saw \*\*an opportunity\*\*.



They smiled too wide.  

Spoke too gently.  

Asked too many questions about where he slept, how alone he was, if he wanted a ‚Äúreal job.‚Äù



There were shadows in the port that didn‚Äôt walk‚Äîthey \*\*waited\*\*.



Watched.



He learned early how to run.  

How to hide.



How to scream‚Äînot loudly, but in a way that caught the right kind of attention.



More than once, it had saved him.



Other times?



He‚Äôd been lucky.



Too lucky, maybe.



\---



\### ‚ú¶ The Drift



Cael didn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôd stopped walking until the soft chime in his headset faded to silence. The playlist looped. A new track began.



He looked up.



He was standing under a glass trellis, vines curling over metal in a strangely delicate pattern. He didn‚Äôt remember getting here.



Didn‚Äôt remember putting his coffee flask away.



His heart was beating a little faster. Not panic‚Äîjust the echo of old things crawling up from deep inside.



He closed his eyes and exhaled, long and low.



‚ÄúStill here,‚Äù he whispered to himself. ‚ÄúStill breathing.‚Äù



\---



The memory of \*\*Dino‚Äôs voice\*\* came back again:



\> \*‚ÄúStick with us. We‚Äôll keep you breathing.‚Äù\*



And Bee‚Äôs laughter‚Äî



\> \*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine now.‚Äù\*



He felt the ghost of a smile tug at his lips.



Because back then?  

Before they found him?  

Before he had a name someone wanted to say out loud?



\*\*He hadn‚Äôt been Cael Rowan.\*\*



He‚Äôd just been hungry.  

Alone.  

A shadow.



\---



\*\*09:15 AM\*\*  

And now?



Now he was walking through a university built between stars.  

Wearing crocs. Smelling like oranges. Thinking about breakfast.



Still shaken.  

Still soft in the middle.



But \*\*held\*\*‚Äîby memory, by laughter, by the gravity of two voices that never let go.



\---



\*\*End of Chapter 7 ‚Äì Part Two\*\*





enjoy. :p

I‚Äôll make strong acquaintances, people who I will have good and sometimes even deep conversations with while we‚Äôre around each other at school and work. But when people make plans to go out to lunch in the room with me, they never ask me. We can talk about life events, and it all feels like friendship. But nothing happens once we‚Äôre not being forced by circumstance to interact. And the few friends I did have are radio silent. I realized I always initiated our outings and hang-outs, so for both of them, I stopped initiating. Haven‚Äôt heard from either in months. I‚Äôm so incredibly lonely. I have issues with not realizing my delivery is harsh (or so I‚Äôve been told - I struggle to hear my tone or voice how others hear it, as rude and angry or whatever). But I am happy to clear up confusion. Ask me if I meant it meanly. The answer‚Äôs probably no, that I didn‚Äôt even realize how it came across. I‚Äôve tried my whole life to fix that. Still an issue. I‚Äôm so tired of being so lonely. I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I want to have friends, to go to events and coffee shops and each other‚Äôs houses. To chat about life and books and the weather. To cheer on when things are good and to support and rely on when things are bad. It hurts so badly to know that there‚Äôs so few people who have ever initiated a hang-out with me. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. Please help?",1,1745027077.0,Adulting,0,1.0,False

Am I just an idiot?""","After a while, we had a video call, but she never wanted to show her face ‚Äî she always claimed her hair was a mess. Later, she told me (in her own words) that she was autistic.

Our conversations were usually pretty one-sided. We once made plans to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she‚Äôd injured her leg. After telling me about her autism, she often pointed out that I was treating her differently.

She eventually opened up about her past ‚Äî how her ex had left her, how she‚Äôd been involved with another guy but ended up getting replaced. One time, after I was mugged and almost lost her number, I noticed how indifferent she was; she didn‚Äôt seem too bothered and even told me she wouldn‚Äôt text me unless I texted her first.

She used to talk a lot about her cats and mentioned her nephews were also autistic. I remember she once got really angry when her cousin brought up that she used to drink with her ex.

Later on, I asked her to go to the movies, since she‚Äôd always say we‚Äôd never actually hang out. At first, she said she was too shy, but after some convincing, she agreed. The next day, though, she asked me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think it‚Äôd be better if we were just friends?‚Äù

Despite that, we still went. We met at the theater, bought some candy, kissed during the movie, and spent the rest of the afternoon cuddling. She never let me see her phone, always kept her distance, and only gave me her Instagram after we‚Äôd broken up.

Another time, we went to the mall, she gave me some chocolate, and we ended up at a motel. Once there, she said she was feeling too shy and didn‚Äôt want the lights on. I told her it was okay, but she quickly became defensive and her mood completely shifted.

Before all that, we‚Äôd spent an afternoon at the park kissing, and when it was time for her to head home, I offered to walk her back. It always felt like she was trying to avoid introducing me to her family. I walked her home and left.

Another day, her sister dropped her off at my place. I mentioned how we rarely went out because she always had an excuse, and she got really upset that I brought it up.

Once, we were playing a game together, and I criticized it ‚Äî she got annoyed and stopped playing. Later, she brought me chocolate, we spent some time together, and not long after, she brought up the idea of breaking up.

She once invited me to a party but later told me she wasn‚Äôt going, only to change her mind. I was annoyed and asked if she didn‚Äôt want me there. I told her I‚Äôd go and asked if I could come early, but she made it clear I shouldn‚Äôt show up before 6 PM.

I went early anyway. Her sister saw me on the street and invited me up. Later, we went to her friend‚Äôs party, and she introduced me as her boyfriend. Out of nowhere, she suggested, ‚ÄúShould we download an app to find you a hot girl?‚Äù

After the party, we went to her place. She wanted me to stay the night, but I ended up going home.

After everything that happened, I eventually called her and ended it. She started crying and blocked me. Later on, she told me I had pushed her into therapy and that I had taken away her happiness.

Still, she texted me saying she missed me more than she expected. We started talking again. One day, while we were still in touch, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she claimed she was just helping her friend look for her ex.

In the end, I told her I loved her. She replied that the feeling would fade, and told me she'd been somewhere and wished I was there. Later, she called me and invited me to her mother‚Äôs birthday party, but I didn‚Äôt go. Her mother even called me asking if I loved her. Afterward, her mom invited me over for coffee.

We kept talking for a while, and she mentioned that her dad was really angry at me. I felt terrible and ended up venting about the whole thing online. She found out, confronted me, and said I had lied and used her ‚Äî that her behavior was all rooted in her insecurity and autism ‚Äî and that she‚Äôd been praying for me every day. After that, she blocked me and vanished",2,1745026927.0,AITAH,0,0.75,False

1k2l4iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1k2l4iv/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

There is no specific speaking time at this event. We will have a couple speakers at a time and then have people disperse in order to interact with the information tables, grab some water or a snack, and rotate to different areas.

If you are wanting to hear the speakers as much as possible, just keep an ear out for Holly announcing the next speakers.

We really appreciate everyone following these little ""dont's.  


Furthermore, please see the post by Christi below. Previously we held a drive for the Food Pantry, but thanks to the generosity of our community they are currently very well stocked!

I think Nat might be viewing it as ‚Äúomg I spoil my siblings‚Ä¶I do this and that and blah blah blah‚Äù and is comparing that with her relationship with Edith‚Ä¶ which imo is a bit unfair because I‚Äôm sure if edith had 1 million followers and hundreds of thousands of dollars to drop of new coffee machines whenever she feels like it.. then yes I think edith would do all the things ‚Ä¶ or even more for her siblings. people do the best they can with what they have at the time. 

going back to how she might be comparing Edith to how she herself is as a sister.. again I do find this a little unfair‚Ä¶ but I do think that the things she does for her siblings come off as disingenuous and more so just to get all the credit for it by people/followers saying she‚Äôs kind/nice‚Ä¶ rather than her genuinely wanting to do it. yes nat has her moments where she does genuinely do stuff and get stuff for other people but in this case with Edith I think if that is the view she has or reason why she doesn‚Äôt like edith‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable.

I knew her somewhat before contacting her and we have many friends in common in addition to studying in the same university. The date went relatively well and we stayed in touch after it. 

After a while she took more time to answer (~1 week) and I may have been too rude when I asked her why she took so long to answer on two occasions. After that I asked to know about her interest to even talk and if she wanted to continue. She didn't say yes but apologized for answering so late. After that she went no contact and basically ghosted me.

 After waiting for a week with no reply, I asked her out again. After that, I suggested that if she didnt want to talk with me, she should say so, unfollow me or just block me. Again, no reaction even after a month.

Now this is bothering me very much and I'm losing sleep over this. I can deal with rejection but being ghosted like this hurts much more because I really can't understand why she did this. I'm now asking for advice on how to handle this situation? Should I do something or just try to forget the whole thing? We have a high likelyhood of bumping into each other in the future.

I ended up doing too much at week 3 after coming off Prednisone due to my swollen tonsils. It masked my fatigue and I overexerted myself. I made the mistake of also having caffeine, which masked fatigue even more. I felt like I was going to collapse because my legs felt so weak. Took two weeks to stay home from classes and slept a lot that first week. The second week was better but I tried to stay off my feet as much as possible. 

I have been hitting 10,000 steps and heading to classes every day. I had a rough day Tuesday because I slept horribly so I had to skip one class and lay down. I can't say this enough: PACE YOURSELF. It's okay to take a moment or day and just stay in bed and chill. 

If you notice that you are tired, try to sit or lay down. Stay away from caffeine and coffee. Buy a water bottle to stay hydrated and start taking a multivitamin. Eat a good breakfast and don't skip on meals. Don't keep looking at your Apple Watch for your heart rate. Don't do stuff that makes you anxious. Stay away from nicotine, alcohol, and weed.  

If your body feels weak, you may need to take two weeks and stay in bed as much as possible. This is completely normal. Trust me on this. There are a lot of good movies on Netflix right now and it's also a perfect time to get a library card. ",2,1745025455.0,Mononucleosis,1,1.0,False

Griffin doesn't drop any coffees, sadly, but he DOES drop a VR headset.

Why?","I have recently noticed a pattern where I find men are unexpectedly affectionate on the first date, such as asking to hold my hand or giving me a forehead kiss. This has never happened to any of my female friends on a first date, but I have found that it happens to me almost every time and ESPECIALLY when I think that the date is moving in a more casual/hook-up direction. Why?!
Do you think this has to do more with how I am presenting myself or is it just related to men I am mutually attracted to?

Here are a few of the most salient experiences for context.

Scenario 1: Match on bumble with 25M entrepreneur. He grew up in Indian, went to college in Colorado, and was temporarily living with family in my town but would be traveling soon. It seemed like we were both interested in a casual relationship. He took me out to dinner, we went to a bar after and he bought me a drink. Vibes were really good I thought. He walked me to my car, gave me a hug, then a FOREHEAD KISS, then left. I received a goodnight text and then never heard directly from him again.

Scenario 2: Match on hinge with 29M nurse. Grew up in California, college in Tennessee. We had a super brief exchange on the app before agreeing to just chat in person the next night. We go out, have a couple drinks on the date. I thought it went well, but he didn‚Äôt share too much about his life despite me asking questions so if anything I thought he might not be that interested in me. We leave the bar, he asks if he can walk me to my car, and when I say yes he grabs my hand to hold!

Scenario 3: Match on tinder with 26M army. Grew up and went to college in Virginia. Our coffee date had fantastic energy but we clearly had different values on family, religion, politics, etc‚Ä¶ I agree to walk around a little bit in the city after the date and when we leave the coffee shop he asked to hold my hand!


These are not the only times, but are representative of how it normally goes. I see no pattern among the men I‚Äôm dating‚Ä¶ so does anyone have insight into why this is happening?! Are my hands and forehead simply irresistible? Am I somehow signaling for them to be affectionate? Men, in what scenarios would you act like this?

So I got flamed twice more and I just went to do some coffee and kinda afk the last 5 10 min (which is the first time I do this ever almost). The funny thing is I got a message from riot like I was inting and the brand got an S for nice farming and nice kda (no deaths).

He texted me today.","My brother Joe had been crashing on my couch after his wife Amanda left him. Their son, Jonah, said the R-word at school. Turns out he learned it from a YouTuber Joe let him watch. Amanda had warned him before, asked him to screen stuff Jonah watched, but Joe always brushed it off. She‚Äôd had enough. She packed up and left.

Joe came to me, but he was still acting like it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. Still cracking jokes, still shrugging things off. I didn‚Äôt know how to talk to him anymore without losing it, so I wrote about it here. Just to let it out. He found the post and left that same night without saying much.

That was a few days ago.

This morning, I got a text from him. Just said, ""I‚Äôm at a diner. Can we talk?""

I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. I was nervous, to be honest. But I went.

He looked rough. Like he hadn‚Äôt slept. Hoodie, messy hair, red eyes. We sat down and didn‚Äôt say anything for a bit. Then he just said, ‚ÄúI read what you wrote. All of it. I hated you for it. But I think I needed it.‚Äù

That hit me. I told him I wasn‚Äôt trying to humiliate him. I just didn‚Äôt know how to say any of that out loud without it turning into a fight. I was angry, yeah, but mostly I was scared. Watching him lose everything and still act like it didn‚Äôt matter just broke something in me.

He told me he‚Äôs been thinking about all of it. That maybe he hides behind sarcasm and ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äù because he doesn‚Äôt know how to handle things when they are. He admitted that Amanda was right. That Jonah deserves better. That maybe this was the wake-up call he needed.

We cried. Quietly. At a diner booth, over cold coffee.

He‚Äôs not coming back to stay here. He found a room he can afford for now. He said he‚Äôs going to give Amanda space and look for a therapist. Said he wants to be the kind of dad Jonah can actually rely on. The kind Amanda doesn‚Äôt have to protect their son from.

We‚Äôre not suddenly fine. This didn‚Äôt fix everything. But it was something. And after the last few days, something feels like a hell of a lot.

If you‚Äôre holding back on saying something to someone because you think it‚Äôll just explode everything, I get it. But sometimes silence does more damage. And sometimes the person you think won‚Äôt hear you actually will.

Thanks for reading. I needed to get this off my chest.

How much should the coffee beans weigh before I grind for the perfect cup with this much water? Thought?

I drink light, dark and medium roasts.
