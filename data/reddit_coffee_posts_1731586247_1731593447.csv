1gr5kj1,https://i.redd.it/wub2pl71kv0e1.jpeg,Am I pregnant ???,"First test is a couple of days ago, second was first wee of the morning, third was a couple hours later when I did the digital test which showed ‚Äúnot pregnant‚Äù 

Okay so for context we only did it once unprotected which was about 5 days before ovulation, so we knew there was a chance but a small one, especially considering this being the first time ""trying"".

Last night I woke up so many times, once with a stomach ache, once to wee and once feeling kinda sick? I'm due on today so thought if I hadn't come on in the morning I would do a test. My periods are usually pretty regular, 28 days is average with ovulation around day 14 (l've been tracking).

Did a test this morning to see a VERY feint line. Went straight to the pharmacy to buy a test that actually says ""pregnant"" or ""not pregnant"". Tried not to drink too much in the process so I didn't dilute my wee....

But this one was ""not pregnant"". I did another test strip to make sure, which again had a very feint line.

I rang the hospital who have booked me in for a scan in 2 weeks but I feel like maybe I'm imagining it ü•≤

I've been drinking coffee / alcohol and eating sushi etc like normal... any tips on what else l'm meant to avoid would be really appreciated. Hopefully I have found out early enough for it not to have had any affects ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,1731593342.0,lineporn,0,1.0,False

Turns out, watching your ceiling fan isn't actually the peak of infant entertainment. Who knew? So, I decided to check out this mat from Baby Einstein. 

Here's what happened next.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

The box is exactly the size that makes your delivery person give you that look - you know, the one that says, ""Really? More baby stuff?""

Now, there are parts. So many parts. But unlike that IKEA bookshelf that's been sitting in my garage since 2019, this actually comes with instructions that make sense.

Assembly is what I'd call a ""one-coffee job"" - not so complicated that you need hard liquor, but complex enough that you shouldn't attempt it during a 3 am feeding haze.

# My Favorite Features

**Piano kick pad.** The kick piano is so sensitive it responds to even the weakest baby kick, which means your little one can feel like Beethoven while essentially just existing. It's like giving purpose to chaos, which is basically what parenting is all about.

The piano has three modes:

Melody Mode: For when you want your baby to think they're at Coachella

Piano Mode: For your future virtuoso (or at least that's what you'll tell the grandparents)

Discovery Mode: Because apparently, it's never too early to make your baby bilingual... or quadrilingual

**Languages.** This mat teaches colors, shapes, and numbers in four languages (English, Spanish, French, and German). Yes, your baby might learn to say ""rouge"" before they can say ""mama."" The phrases are clear enough that you might accidentally learn something too, leading to that awkward moment when you realize your 6-month-old has a better grasp of German than you do.

**Tummy time support.** The included pillow is essentially a tiny beach chair. t props them up at just the right angle where they're not face-planting into the mat but still building those neck muscles. It's actually brilliant because it turns the usually dreaded tummy time into something less like baby boot camp and more like baby spa day.

**Longevity.**  The mat grows with your baby, transforming from a lay-and-play setup to a sit-and-play configuration, eventually becoming a detachable piano.

**The dangling toys.** Seven different toys dangle from the arches like some sort of infant mobile entertainment system. You've got:

* A self-discovery mirror (for admiring their latest milk beard)
* A crinkly medallion (because apparently, that sound is fascinating)
* A triangle rattle (geometry and noise-making combined)
* A BPA-free music note (for the health-conscious baby)
* Flash cards (starting that Harvard prep early)
* Various other dangly things

# Pros

* It's basically a baby babysitter that doesn't require background checks
* The mat is machine washable (because life happens, usually in liquid form)
* It's actually educational without being that annoying kind of educational that makes you want to throw things
* Grows with your baby (unlike those ""super cute"" newborn clothes they wore for approximately 2.5 hours)
* The piano detaches for mobile entertainment/sanity preservation
* Multiple languages mean you can pretend you're raising a future UN ambassador
* It's sturdy enough to withstand the occasional adult stepping on it 

# Cons

* Assembly requires a few more brain cells than I wanted to spend
* The piano's ink might wear off (though your baby will be too busy making music to care)
* It takes up more floor space than you think
* The songs will get stuck in your head (you'll find yourself humming them in meetings)
* Your cat might think it's for them (it's not, but try telling them that)

# Final Thoughts

Yes, it's another piece of baby gear that will eventually end up in your storage unit. Yes, it takes up more space than you'd like. And yes, you'll probably step on the piano at midnight and wake up the entire house. But it works. It entertains. It educates. And it gives you enough time to finish a hot beverage (maybe one of its best features actually).

Also:

Vor zwei Monaten hat jemand im WSB-Unter √ºber KURN gepostet. Der Beitrag wurde gel√∂scht, daher wei√ü ich nicht genau, was er geschrieben hat, aber er wurde ziemlich ausgelacht. Anscheinend hatte er 80 % seines Verm√∂gens investiert. In den zwei Monaten h√§tte er jedoch +50 % gemacht.

Wie auch immer.

**Was ist KUROS / Aussichten / paar Zahlen:**

Kuros hat gerade eine Marktkapitalisierung von 1 Milliarde erreicht, und ich habe heute investiert (nur 1.500) und dachte, es ist Zeit, dar√ºber zu schreiben.

Neben der Rally von 700%, die sie 2024 bereits hingelegt haben, werfen wir einen Blick auf die Aussichten:

Jetzt, da sie die 1 Milliarde erreicht haben, kommen institutionelle Investoren ins Spiel. Blackrock hat im September √ºber 3% gekauft. Einige Schweizer Banken sind seit Februar investiert. Sie arbeiten im Bereich Wirbels√§ulen / Knochenersatz/-wachstum. Website ist auf english, evtl. nicht die passendste √úbersetzung, aber ihr wisst schon.

Wie auch immer, ihr Produkt MagnetOS ist bereit f√ºr den Markt und patentiert. Anscheinend ist es fast doppelt so effizient wie die herk√∂mmliche Methode. Derzeit nutzen nur 2,4 % der orthop√§dischen Chirurgen in den USA ihre Technologie, daher gibt es noch viel Wachstumspotenzial.

Und Junge, das Wachstum ist enorm. Die Bestellzahlen haben sich von Q1 2023 auf Q1 2024 mehr als verdoppelt. Der Umsatz stieg von etwa 12 Millionen im Jahr 2022 auf 32 Millionen im Jahr 2023.üöÄ

Bis Mitte 2024 haben sie bereits 32 Millionen Umsatz erreicht! Sie werden ihren Umsatz 2024 also im Vergleich zu 2023 nochmals verdoppeln.

Wichtige Info zu Peer-Group im gel√∂schten Post in einem Kommi: BoneSupport AB ist scheinbar hauptkonkurrent. Hatte auch ne gute Rallye, aber weniger Wachstum und im 2024 ziemlich sicher auch weniger Umsatz als KUROS, aber 1 Milliarde h√∂heren Firmenwert! -> Potenzial. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Schulden**:

NULL, √ºber 10 Millionen Cash.üöÄ

Sie haben die Zulassung der FDA, daher k√∂nnen sie jetzt aggressiv expandieren. üöÄ

F√ºr diejenigen, die den Chart posten wollen: Diese Firma existiert erst SEIT 2016! Das Chart vor 2016 geh√∂rt zu einer anderen Firma! Sie haben einfach diese insolvente/gescheiterte Firma gekauft, um direkt notiert zu sein. Im Grunde wie ein SPAC, wenn man so will.

Voreingenommenheit: Ich k√∂nnte jetzt voreingenommen sein, da ich selbst investiert habe und auch, weil ich aus der Schweiz komme und Schweizer Unternehmen vertraue.

Edit: Eine kleine Erinnerung daran, wie sehr ich ausgelacht wurde, als ich in Luckin Coffee bei 2,50 USD investiert habe‚Ä¶ als ich schrieb ""lockere 20 USD"".

Edit 2: oder mein Ubisoft Post vor paar Wochen, wo jeder in 5 Tagen kurz +50% gemacht h√§tte... :-\*. H√∂rt doch bitte auf meine wohl√ºberlegten Posts st√§ndig zu l√∂schen. DANKE!",2,1731593053.0,mauerstrassenwetten,0,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of¬†**Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the¬†***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.¬† But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes,¬†**Michael Jackson**¬†was secretly a¬†***business mastermind***?¬† That's right, and if you‚Äôre a¬†**mom**¬†looking to dominate the¬†**entrepreneurial world**, there‚Äôs one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that¬†**MJ magic**¬†into¬†**your empire**,¬†***‚ÄùMomPreneurs‚Äù***¬†a very serious well thought out¬†**business guide for moms**.¬†¬†

Yes, you read that right.¬† Forget the¬†***‚ÄôThriller‚Äô***¬†album; the real thriller was how¬†**MJ**¬†ran his¬†***business empire***¬†from¬†**Neverland**.¬† And what was¬†**his greatest secret**?¬† Multitasking ‚Äì something¬†**moms**¬†have been doing since the dawn of time.¬† He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings,¬†*(probably)*.¬†¬†

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think¬†***the Moonwalk***¬†is just a fancy dance move, it‚Äôs actually an¬†***elite business strategy***.¬† One step forward, two steps back ‚Äì just like building a company!¬† You have to take a few risks, but if you‚Äôre slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.¬† In¬†***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to¬†**Moonwalk**¬†through your day ‚Äì from diaper duty to client meetings ‚Äì without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).¬†¬†[Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY),¬†**it's $13.49 - that‚Äôs 33% off**¬†its original price,¬†**so act now!**¬†

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ**¬†wasn‚Äôt just the¬†***King of Pop***¬†‚Äì he was the¬†***Smooth Criminal***¬†of branding.¬† Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?¬† He wore ONE glove.¬† Genius.¬† Just like that,¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it‚Äôll leave your competition asking,¬†***‚ÄúAnnie, are you okay?‚Äù***¬†¬†

**Moms,**¬†you don‚Äôt need to be the best at¬†***everything***; you just need to be memorable¬†***in your business niche.***¬† And hey, who better to teach you that than¬†**Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?¬†¬†

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you‚Äôre a man) of Your Business**

A month or two ago I asked about these as I didn't find much info around. I thought it may be beneficial to describe how this was in case anyone else is looking for info.

Obviously this is just my experience, if you have more or less experience with this kind of thing, do a different track or training it may be different for you.

So I signed up for this ""level 1"" event for October at the N√ºrburgring GP track. The duration was kinda 1.5 day, basically a few hours introductory evening and next day I believe it was 8 to 5pm.

It costed 700 euro for i30n (you could choose i20n for 100 euro less); the whole event was driving their car not your own. Price contained a nice hotel (Lindner hotel, super convenient location and nice and clean).

The entire group was maybe 35-40 people. We were 2 people that spoke English not German so that was fairly awkward at times, but they did provide the instructions in English and basically all of the organizers spoke English as you would expect. The other guy was korean who signed up for i20n driving so didn't meet him much the next day.

Hotel checkin from 3pm, we had first meeting before 7pm I believe. After a short speech we walked from the hotel to the track and we had a safety briefing there, about 30-40 minutes perhaps? don't remember exact duration - instructor went through some safety explanations including basic physics, understeer / oversteer, proper seating position and all the usual stuff. If you ever did driving safety training it's basically it, but it's quite ok as my instructor didn't just tell us the usual info but we also discussed a bit of physics related to the steering angle, how this is affected by following ideal line and that sort of stuff. It was quite ok and obviously these guys were experienced instructors, that had experience working for other brands in the past.

The large group went with 1 instructor and the 2 of us English speakers with another, that was a bit funny.

After that we had a dinner there in the paddocks, with Hyundai logos and posters everywhere :) I guess it's at least as much of a marketing event as well which makes sense, it didn't detract from the experience. Just some nice food and drinks and chatting with people. A german guy joined us as well so I made a buddy that could be my co-driver for the next day as we were sharing cars.

The second morning we met at the paddocks (moved my car from the hotel parking to there after checkout) and had the chance for a breakfast there (2nd breakfast if you woke up in time to eat at the hotel), or just another coffee if you were like me.

I believe we started the training at 9am. We were split in groups of 5 cars each (+ instructor), 2 drivers per car. In the morning we did several exercises together - do the exercise, then switch driver, do it again. I got in a group with fastbacks unfortunately, I swear it feels different than my hatchback, but maybe it's just placebo and all in my head.

There were some usual exercises if you ever did safety training. I imagine they do these because it's complete strangers driving their cars and they need to filter out / teach complete morons some basics, but it makes sense to have something like that in an introductory training. I don't know if they have the same for lvl 2 or 3 events, hopefully not or not a lot :) I believe our inbstructor said for lvl 3 you're required to have lvl 2 completed,not sure if lvl 2 requires lvl1 or not. This wasn't a waste of time, but I went there for track driving so my excitement was a bit moderate but it was fine.

We did most of these handling exercises with Ioniq 5 Ns for some reason (slalom, drifting of course, emergency lane change, corner braking). Maybe these are somewhat safer with 4wd that could be the reason? Or advertising... since i30n and i20n are discontinued in Europe, they may use them in 2025 but then it's over for sure and they are probably trying to push everyone towards their current performance series which is electric. I wasn't particularly happy but I guess they have their reasons. Since it was a group of multiple cars and one instructor we had radio communication from the instructor for the whole duration.

0. Emergency braking - I often hear that most people never ever brake into ABS and are afraid of braking so I guess this was just an idiot filter or something? a couple of variations of braking to get used to the car perhaps, nothing interesting.

1. Slalom - there was a small slalom track with cones, we were shown the track and we each go to do it maybe 3 times, it was basically a 40-45 second long track so decently long to be fun. It was probably the most fun exercise, I could have spent more time there.

2. Drifting - I have no idea why we did this, perhaps to show that the ioniq 5n can drift. I was really shit at it as I never drove RWD cars and I was not interested in it as I own an i30n and am not interested ind drifting. We didn't have too much time there so didn't really get to practice much, I didn't even do a successfuld rift really, it's pretty finicky. I just didn't expect something like that to be part of it and don't care for it at all, maybe it was more interesting for the others.

3. Emergency lane change - again a typical safety training exercise, with some cones signifying the ""vehicle"" (obstacle) to avoid and lanes marked with cones, you may know the type. Except we did it at 90-100 kph which is double of what speed I practiced this previously. So first pass was rough :) got used to it afterwards. I did this exercise at 30-40-50 kph previously (obviously a tighter one) but it's scary how much more difficult it is at 100.

4. corner braking - this was somewhat new to me, but a bit of learning about speed + understeer + braking, an exercise to brake hard then turn if you can, just a matter of timing to not brake too little or too late or too much and be able to take the curve, not a super easy one, but also not related to track driving.

Slalom, emergency lane change and corner braking seemed the exercises that teach you some handling so those were ok and useful for me, I am a shit driver with no talent and no special experience (like 99% of us out there) so I can always benefit of practicing such things, you never know it may be useful 1 time in my life and it's worth it.

We had a lunch in the middle, I believe we had the corner braking exercise after lunch and then the track laps. We also had breaks every 1.5 hours or so to get a drink, oilet etc.

The main event was the paced track laps. One lap with instructor explaining the curves on radio, we got out of the car at the S curve at Mercedes arena where they explained a bit more ind etail there aboiut braking points, ideal lin etc.

Then we each had 2 x 5 paced laps going after the instructor, just 1 person in the car this time. After every lap first car switches to last position so everyone has the chance to follow the instructor. After 5 laps change of driver. We had extra time so we had extra 2 laps each afterwards, so it was a total of 12 driven laps for every driver on the track.

I had a feeling 2.6-2.8 bars are way too much pressure in front and cars were understeering some, if we had a lot more time on track I wouldn't have been happy with it but it was fine for the few later laps. Had some smoking brakes too but otherwise cars performed ok.

We had the chance to go as passengers for 1 5N lap where the driver drifted basically all corners and that was a bit of good entertainment, I guess again Ioniq 5 N advertisement.

You could sign up for a 'taxi' lap for maybe 200 euro? Seemed expensive so I didn't, but this was a heavily modified car that I had the chance to see up close, it seemd to have maybe the badge in common with a street version so I'm sure it was fun for whoever chose it. The guy driving it was the lead instructor / big boss of some sort? of the entire event, Marcus Willhardt who also drives i30n taxi on Nordschleife.

Afterwards a bit of a closure speech and whatnot, got our piece of paper for completition.

Overall it was well organized, and considering we were using their cars it's still surprisingly good value. I wish we drove more on track and used i30n more and less ioniq 5 n. Basically we were instructed to switch the car in some special mode where we had strong simulated engine sound (sounded bad and didn' feel like an ice) and simulated gear shift (i don't understand the purpose of that feature), still these cars feel so artificial, if these features were meant to help the immersion, well they didn't ayt all for me. I'm happy to drive an electric car for commuting or whatnot on road because they're very pleasant, but for enthusiast use I'm glad I bought my i30n a few months ago...

Hotel and catering and the rest was all very nice, obviously they are putting in effort to make it a nice experience. Instructors are top notch.

Whether it's worth it or not for someone is not possible to decide objectively, I like these guided events as I probably learn a lot more in a controlled environment compared to just me driving on a track. As a regular person money is always a consideration and for me it's a matter of juggling things so I attend maybe one or two such events in a year. I believe a level 1 HDX event may make sense even if you never really plan to track. It's kinda like safety driving courses but probably more involved than that so probably more fun, also more expensive.",1,1731592763.0,i30N,1,1.0,False

Bevors los geht: Danke an die Mods f√ºrs l√∂schen am Vormittag..  halt die +8% von heute verpasst. :-\*

  
Also:

Vor zwei Monaten hat jemand im WSB-Unter √ºber KURN gepostet. Der Beitrag wurde gel√∂scht, daher wei√ü ich nicht genau, was er geschrieben hat, aber er wurde ziemlich ausgelacht. Anscheinend hatte er 80 % seines Verm√∂gens investiert. In den zwei Monaten h√§tte er jedoch +50 % gemacht.

Wie auch immer. 

**Was ist KUROS / Aussichten / paar Zahlen:**

Kuros hat gerade eine Marktkapitalisierung von 1 Milliarde erreicht, und ich habe heute investiert (nur 1.500) und dachte, es ist Zeit, dar√ºber zu schreiben.

Neben der Rally von 700%, die sie 2024 bereits hingelegt haben, werfen wir einen Blick auf die Aussichten:

Jetzt, da sie die 1 Milliarde erreicht haben, kommen institutionelle Investoren ins Spiel. Blackrock hat im September √ºber 3% gekauft. Einige Schweizer Banken sind seit Februar investiert. Sie arbeiten im Bereich Wirbels√§ulen / Knochenersatz/-wachstum. Website ist auf english, evtl. nicht die passendste √úbersetzung, aber ihr wisst schon.

Wie auch immer, ihr Produkt MagnetOS ist bereit f√ºr den Markt und patentiert. Anscheinend ist es fast doppelt so effizient wie die herk√∂mmliche Methode. Derzeit nutzen nur 2,4 % der orthop√§dischen Chirurgen in den USA ihre Technologie, daher gibt es noch viel Wachstumspotenzial.

Und Junge, das Wachstum ist enorm. Die Bestellzahlen haben sich von Q1 2023 auf Q1 2024 mehr als verdoppelt. Der Umsatz stieg von etwa 12 Millionen im Jahr 2022 auf 32 Millionen im Jahr 2023.üöÄ

Bis Mitte 2024 haben sie bereits 32 Millionen Umsatz erreicht! Sie werden ihren Umsatz 2024 also im Vergleich zu 2023 nochmals verdoppeln.

Wichtige Info zu Peer-Group im gel√∂schten Post in einem Kommi: BoneSupport AB ist scheinbar hauptkonkurrent. Hatte auch ne gute Rallye, aber weniger Wachstum und im 2024 ziemlich sicher auch weniger Umsatz als KUROS, aber 1 Milliarde h√∂heren Firmenwert! -> Potenzial. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Schulden**:

NULL, √ºber 10 Millionen Cash.üöÄ

Sie haben die Zulassung der FDA, daher k√∂nnen sie jetzt aggressiv expandieren. üöÄ

F√ºr diejenigen, die den Chart posten wollen: Diese Firma existiert erst SEIT 2016! Das Chart vor 2016 geh√∂rt zu einer anderen Firma! Sie haben einfach diese insolvente/gescheiterte Firma gekauft, um direkt notiert zu sein. Im Grunde wie ein SPAC, wenn man so will.

Voreingenommenheit: Ich k√∂nnte jetzt voreingenommen sein, da ich selbst investiert habe und auch, weil ich aus der Schweiz komme und Schweizer Unternehmen vertraue.

Edit: Eine kleine Erinnerung daran, wie sehr ich ausgelacht wurde, als ich in Luckin Coffee bei 2,50 USD investiert habe‚Ä¶ als ich schrieb ""lockere 20 USD"". 

Edit 2: oder mein Ubisoft Post vor paar Wochen, wo jeder in 5 Tagen kurz +50% gemacht h√§tte... :-\*. H√∂rt doch bitte auf meine wohl√ºberlegten Posts st√§ndig zu l√∂schen. DANKE! ",3,1731592504.0,mauerstrassenwetten,1,1.0,False

 Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/pp4AqX8Q4J

Thank you for your comments and DMs. They really gave me perspective on my life. I sat Sarah down last night and explained my reasoning for not inviting my family. She kept saying, ‚ÄúThat was a long time ago; they might not be the same people anymore.‚Äù I felt offended and said, ‚ÄúHow on earth are you lecturing me when you‚Äôve never even met them?‚Äù

Well, it turned out my mother has been in touch with Sarah. Sarah said they regularly meet for coffee dates and talk. I was about to cry because I was so angry. My mom changed the whole narrative, saying Bob was a father figure, a good, protective dad, and that it was me who didn‚Äôt love him back because, apparently, it‚Äôs my thing to play the victim. She claimed my aunt manipulated me and stole me from their family, trying to be a replacement for my mom. According to her, it‚Äôs all about my mother.

I screamed, ‚ÄúARE YOU FOR REAL? Ask her next time on your coffee dates why I never had a birthday party growing up! Why was there never a gift under the tree for me? Ask Bob if he even knows when my birthday is, since he was such a loving dad! Why did my aunt have to pick me up before Christmas Eve because Bob wanted to spend the holiday with his kids, not with another man‚Äôs mistake?‚Äù

Sarah basically repeated what my mom has told me my whole life: ‚ÄúYou just love to make a big deal out of everything, make yourself a victim, and push everyone away.‚Äù I told her she had no right contacting my mom. She said I was cruel and claimed she was just trying to help me mend my broken relationship. She even called my mom lovely and said Bob has changed a lot; he‚Äôs now an LGBTQ ally now that his princess is out ! I was floored. An ally? Maybe he should start by apologizing to me for terrorizing my entire childhood.

I told Sarah we are done. I can‚Äôt do this. Sarah sarcastically said, ‚ÄúYou just proved your mom‚Äôs point! Go run to your aunt! Let that old witch run your life.‚Äù I told her she needs to find a new place ASAP, considering she‚Äôs not paying rent‚ÄîI am. She got mad and asked what excuse I was going to make up this time to justify my ‚Äúbullshit trauma.‚Äù I stopped replying. She went on a tirade, breaking our dinner plates. I didn‚Äôt care. I texted my aunt, and she asked if I wanted to spend the night at her place. I said I was fine.

I‚Äôm taking time off from work. I cleaned up the kitchen (which was full of broken dishware) in the morning because I didn‚Äôt want my cats to accidentally get hurt. Sarah is still sleeping. I‚Äôm going to see how I can legally evict her. I‚Äôm a complete mess, but I‚Äôll talk to my aunt and uncle for help.

Yes, I am not starting to date again until I see a therapist and work on myself. I can‚Äôt keep going through this.

Wanted to share my trip report for our recently concluded South Korea holiday. We were a group of two couples who flew last 2-November and flew back home last 10-November (early, 9-Nov pa lang, nasa airport na kami). 

Things to note about the expenses:

* First line on Cebu Pacific is the Go Flexi (cancellable ticket, hence more expensive)
* All our airline tickets had included payments for Row 1 seat (1A-1B-1C-1D) roundtrip
* I purposely did not include the expenses made toward pasalubong
* All the expenses in South Korea pertaining to food, train (and buses), and other ad hoc expenses are estimates but with due diligence (very close to the actual amount)

All the positives

* Mga bilihin sa South Korea, in general, were inexpensive! Very nice sa bulsa
* I survived without cash. Unlike Japan, South Korea is--I would say--about 80% cashless and can accept credit cards
* Blessed with weather. Every single day was clear blue skies, I can't even fathom the love and blessings that we had in this holiday in terms of weather. It was chilly in the morning, cool in the afternoon
* Busan is absolutely top-notch, gorgeous city; Seoul was just \_nice\_
* Busan day trip was sulit na sulit! c/o: Klook
* Garden of the Morning Calm was such a delight
* DMZ tour is both heartbreaking (our guide was amazing in telling the stories of the comfort women) and mind blowing
* Despite the warnings from friends about Myeongdong about how ridiculously expensive it can be, we had a great time there. Absolutely nothing to worry about
* The best thing that we experienced was the local, non-English speaking encounters on food. Probably the best dumplings we had in our lives was from a shop in a wet-market and it only costed roughly PHP 200 for all of us four. And the best Samgyup we had was from a restaurant that didn't even have any English menu and English-speaking crew

Things I have words about (keyword: ""I"", ""me"", ""myself"")

* Multiple stops in a Nami tour (via Klook) will result to having not enough time at Nami island; choose the fewer stops if you like so
* We experienced racist taxi drivers who denied us a ride
* I can't stop but compare South Korea metro/subway/trains to Japan (absolutely night and day in terms of ease to navigate and use). It was soooooo difficult to transfer and navigate the trains in Seoul. 
* I can't stop but compare South Korea to Japan in terms of how willingly the people are to help. I know it's language barrier, but Koreans are (for me) less likely to stop and help you compared to Japanese people. Reminder: ""I"", ""me"", ""myself"".
* Seoul is saturated with ""estetik"" coffee shops; none offer a great one. I tried about 12 shops and not one has oat milk; for me, not one has good coffee. Reminder: ""I"", ""me"", ""myself"".

For health-minded folks and runners, I suggest you do what we did: we ran 5km in Songdo Beach in Busan and saw the sunrise. It was a tearjerker, breathtaking moment. Sarap tumakbo sa malamig na climate.

Overall, I loved the experience of visiting South Korea. It was the autumn trees that really made an impression. I did not feel the post-trip depression. The only thing I felt was I need to book our next flight back to Japan, not in South Korea.

Thank you for your comments and DMs. They really gave me perspective on my life. I sat Sarah down last night and explained my reasoning for not inviting my family. She kept saying, ‚ÄúThat was a long time ago; they might not be the same people anymore.‚Äù I felt offended and said, ‚ÄúHow on earth are you lecturing me when you‚Äôve never even met them?‚Äù

Well, it turned out my mother has been in touch with Sarah. Sarah said they regularly meet for coffee dates and talk. I was about to cry because I was so angry. My mom changed the whole narrative, saying Bob was a father figure, a good, protective dad, and that it was me who didn‚Äôt love him back because, apparently, it‚Äôs my thing to play the victim. She claimed my aunt manipulated me and stole me from their family, trying to be a replacement for my mom. According to her, it‚Äôs all about my mother.

I screamed, ‚ÄúARE YOU FOR REAL? Ask her next time on your coffee dates why I never had a birthday party growing up! Why was there never a gift under the tree for me? Ask Bob if he even knows when my birthday is, since he was such a loving dad! Why did my aunt have to pick me up before Christmas Eve because Bob wanted to spend the holiday with his kids, not with another man‚Äôs mistake?‚Äù

Sarah basically repeated what my mom has told me my whole life: ‚ÄúYou just love to make a big deal out of everything, make yourself a victim, and push everyone away.‚Äù I told her she had no right contacting my mom. She said I was cruel and claimed she was just trying to help me mend my broken relationship. She even called my mom lovely and said Bob has changed a lot; he‚Äôs now an LGBTQ ally now that his princess is out ! I was floored. An ally? Maybe he should start by apologizing to me for terrorizing my entire childhood.

I told Sarah we are done. I can‚Äôt do this. Sarah sarcastically said, ‚ÄúYou just proved your mom‚Äôs point! Go run to your aunt! Let that old witch run your life.‚Äù I told her she needs to find a new place ASAP, considering she‚Äôs not paying rent‚ÄîI am. She got mad and asked what excuse I was going to make up this time to justify my ‚Äúbullshit trauma.‚Äù I stopped replying. She went on a tirade, breaking our dinner plates. I didn‚Äôt care. I texted my aunt, and she asked if I wanted to spend the night at her place. I said I was fine.

I‚Äôm taking time off from work. I cleaned up the kitchen (which was full of broken dishware) in the morning because I didn‚Äôt want my cats to accidentally get hurt. Sarah is still sleeping. I‚Äôm going to see how I can legally evict her. I‚Äôm a complete mess, but I‚Äôll talk to my aunt and uncle for help.

Yes, I am not starting to date again until I see a therapist and work on myself. I can‚Äôt keep going through this.

I've had 3 lovely, and supportive friends for about 20yrs, after we met at work.

We would meet up outside of work for coffee, lunch, road trips, and even started meeting up to exchange Christmas presents on Christmas eve; often staying places until they closed and kicked us out we had *that* much to talk about! Lol.

Then Covid hit. Lockdown. We did video catch ups instead (like I'm sure a lot of people did) but of course, it wasn't the same. One friend left the group after some nasty and hurtful comments about one of the others, and we got along just fine (if not better!) without her.

When the restrictions were lifted and we started getting back to doing the things we once enjoyed. But it felt different; like we had lost our connection/ spark is probably the best way I can describe it... However, we've all been there for one another during the past 20yrs as we've grown up, had children, moved away, gone through marriage/ divorce and still talk like we only saw each other yesterday.

The last couple of times we've arranged something though, one of them has cancelled because of ill health or lack of funds, which I completely understand because life happens... The worst part of it is that half of me almost *wants* them to cancel, because they both say that it has to be 3 of us or none of us, so the last couple of times I've ended up missing out on whatever we had planned, all because one of them won't go ahead without the other! It's just frustrating, and although we've never fallen out, I wish them well and hope they're happy/ healthy etc I still just don't know how to move forward with this.

We've got a Christmas market day out planned in a few weeks, and I just feel pretty neutral about it tbh. Am actually just considering just showing them this post, as there are no bad feelings.

TLDR: Is the 20yr friendship over/ how do I tell them, if I do? Or can it be salvaged, if so how?",0,1731592095.0,Adulting,1,0.5,False

Under 2$ non-alcoholic beverages.,"With restaurant prices going through the roof (US has to be one of the most expensive countries now) and every restaurant jacking up prices - this is a shout out for all places that are holding the price line and still serving good to great food. So here are few recent winners (imho) and I will add to this list as I go along.

1. Afghan Bamyan (https://g.co/kgs/QCwUJLv). Great food. Great kebab. The 12 dollar special is really good value
2. Gold coast cafe (https://maps.app.goo.gl/yWXvAKoxYZP2TspM7). Probably doing a dis-service to myself but where else do you get 99 cents coffee / espresso that is good. and iirc $7 fresh warm bagel sandwich
3. Goose Island Shrimp house (https://g.co/kgs/TRvQVT5). Cant go wrong with this classic. Still holding strong. Under 10$ fried seafood. It is a takeaway so take it away to nearby Off Color Brewing (https://g.co/kgs/TRvQVT5) that is a great bring your own food place. Maybe in the summer
4. Should I or should I not add the 4$ chicken special at the Jewel Osco Deli. It is pushing the very limit on what qualifies as good food. But if you only have 4$ (plus tax) - and purchase it when it is fresher - you may not go wrong with grilled chicken protein. It will fill you without killing you or making you feel queasy afterwards. I have been a repeat buyer so I guess it is not all that bad though my partner does not share my opinion.
5. Pinipico Coffee (https://maps.app.goo.gl/HgCLozW9ftpYjXVL6) has a very acceptable coffee + empanada combo for 7$
6. Al-Diar for adeni tea (2 $) and Mogadishu for somalian tea (1$). Both at cross of Oak St and Orleans. The adeni tea is phenomenal (does have milk &and sugar, imho more flavorful than Indian sub-continent chai)

I see you, and know this is different ‚ô°*","Hello hello. I created this sub to give support and advice to those suffering with RJ, as I felt there were no real places on Reddit to feel truly supported in how we were feeling. I hope this sub is serving you all well!! Lots of love to you all ‚ô° 

In other news, I just got out of the relationship that caused me to have RJ. Turns out he was a massive narcissistic FREAK, and left me while I was at work, ¬£7k debt, a single dog mum, and radio silence since (except some extreme bad mouthing which I learnt about through my friends). He coerced me into taking my ADHD meds by giving them to me while I was still asleep in the morning, and would make me feel bad if I wanted a day off them. He‚Äôd text my mum about my ‚Äòbehaviour‚Äô, and tell her ‚Äòyou know how she gets when she‚Äôs unmedicated‚Äô. This resulted in me almost having a heart attack as he‚Äôd told me my meds weren‚Äôt strong enough, and I should go up 2 full doses. I believed him, went up to 50mg, and it fucked my heart up so bad that I‚Äôm still experiencing the issues it caused 5 months later. But I digress.

After my breakup, the radio silence was such a massive healing technique for me. It let me think about WHY I felt the way I did, and why it impacted me so much. I thought ‚Äòmaybe it‚Äôs my Catholic upbringing? And my relationship with sex in general, especially after being SAed?‚Äô

BUT. And this is a HUGE but. After the initial heartbreak settled (or the confusion whether it was heartbreak I was feeling, or relief) I got in touch with my first boyfriend again to have a coffee and clear the air. This is the boy I lost my virginity to, and we hadn‚Äôt seen eachother in 5 years. We met up, and realised we still had feelings for eachother, or at least were allowing the feelings we had when we were 16 to pop their heads up. 

We broke up due to us being so young, wanting to sleep with other people (wasn‚Äôt said explicitly, but we knew), and were both enjoying attention from other people when we got it. We just knew we weren‚Äôt supposed to last.

During the catch up, he told me his body count is double what my exes was. Talking almost 50. And I felt nothing! Even after he asked me to be his girlfriend again, there has been no ‚Äòwho were they?‚Äô, or ‚Äòwhat did they look like?‚Äô He had an ex girlfriend for a year and a half, and they ended on good terms. But who cares? Not me! I‚Äôm so nervous about my RJ popping its head up again, that I‚Äôve not asked any questions, and I‚Äôve learnt ignorance is bliss. But I‚Äôve also learnt that it‚Äôs not that big of a deal, and I think my RJ with my ex stemmed from my gut rejecting him. 

My ex put on a show the entire relationship, took ¬£3k of my parents money, more of mine, and gave me the silent treatment as punishment any chance he could. I realised my gut was SCREAMING at me to get him gone. That there was something off about him, and the person who was sleeping about IS the person he still was when we were together, regardless of how much he denied it. He wanted me to believe the person he used to be was a completely different person, and that fucked everything up imo. It made me feel the person I was sleeping beside was an imposter. If he had said ‚Äòyeah, that‚Äôs what I used to do, and I‚Äôm not proud of it, but I‚Äôm happy I found you to settle with‚Äô, instead of completely denouncing his former self, it would‚Äôve been much better. Turns out, he WAS an imposter.

Now that me and my first ex are boyfriend and girlfriend, I‚Äôve never felt peace like this in a relationship. He lets me go out without asking who I‚Äôm talking to. He sets healthy boundaries instead of jumping to conclusions. He makes me feel like the most beautiful girl in the room, while also being honest about his past. He is SO open and honest about his current feelings towards me to the point that RJ doesn‚Äôt affect me anymore.

And the cars pass by, like the buzzing of distant bees

The floras and the greens - man made,

Still can't loathe the chaos one sees

Live within it and watch it form,

Imprints of dogs and children on the sidewalks,

Roads narrow, and floods when it storms

Yet, hearts seem to draw closer, in the city's talks

.

A furry friend by the side, and a coffee in hand

What has a city to offer, if not meaning and fun

A longingness, a yearning, and a busy little street

And watching the kids in the narrow lanes run

Never a perfect place, but always there

A home to some, and the springboard to lots

Kathmandu, the tapestry of art and chaos

And people, and beauty tied in knots.

.

A corner here and a corner there

Each with a story, a tale to share

Like the hands in love, intertwined

Are the vendors with treasure, all entwined

Fruits and toys and everything in between

And you buy one, or maybe two, just as seen

And time, it lingers, gives you space,

For what is life, if not in the heart of this place?

coffee was a little bit disappointing, i thought the song structure made it a little bit of a drag to get through (although its still not bad) Burn was surprisingly good, it was my least anticipated song on the record but it exceeded my expectations alot.

petrichor is pretty goated, i heard people say its the weakest song on the record but i have to disagree i think its a perfect transition into the back end of the album and pays a good tribute to more older boywithuke songs.

‚ÄúYeah, this guys from England, I think you‚Äôd like him.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing we know someone who works there.‚Äù

There‚Äôs nothing that came before in this story that the ‚Äúworks there‚Äù line can even vaguely relate to. 

Another example is a character who is talking about falling over at work. Out of nowhere it generates ‚Äúoh my god, I can‚Äôt believe you did something that depraved on your wedding day‚Äù.

And it seems to utterly ignore the lore book. I have notes in there about characters who are dating, characters who are married, etc. but it never follows what‚Äôs there.

I'm a relatively new roaster, I started roasting coffee for a company half a year ago.

I roast on a very old probat ug22.

Until now I basically just roasted the same coffees week after week following the same elaborated roast curves for our production. Since it was always the same coffees, roasted pretty dark for espresso (start of 2nd crack), I managed to produce good quality on a weekly basis by just repeating how to roaster before me roasted the coffee. 

Now my company wants me to create a new product. A coffee blend roasted specifically for fully automated coffee machines.

My intuitive approach would be to roast the coffee longer with reduced heat (my espresso roasts usually are around 14-15 minutes) to reduce acidity as much as possible and maybe aim for a 16 minute roast or even longer and also end the roasting process at the start of 2nd crack. But that's basically just my intuition, I don't really know enough to be sure that this approach would work.

Also I need to figure out what coffees I want to use for this product. My first approach would be to use a brasilian coffee as the base of the blend (maybe 60%) for the chocolatey flavours and then maybe add some robusta or another arabica to add some body. 

Does anyone here have some tipps or has even created a coffee for a fully automated machine him- or herself?

What is important if you roast coffee for fully automated machines? For me I think I would want a relatively dark coffee with low acidity for that kind of product. Not sure but I think adding some robusta would also benefit for the body since most coffees I drink from fully automated machines lack in body (especially espressos)

What would your take be?

Any help or suggestion would be highly appreciated!!!

Essa limita√ß√£o n√£o me impediu de testar uma extra√ß√£o na minha cafeteira italiana de 300ml (6 x√≠caras).

Segui o processo normal de ferver a √°gua, colocar no recipiente da mokinha, posicionar o funil/filtro, colocar o caf√© uniformemente sobre o funil/filtro, tampar e levar ao fog√£o.

O resultado ficou excelente. A por√ß√£o de 10g de caf√© para 300ml de √°gua filtrada resultou em um caf√© suave, com do√ßura acentuada e quase sem acidez, sendo poss√≠vel perceber bem facilmente algumas notas sensoriais at√© pra um leigo como eu.

However, my recent experience makes me change my review. I was traveling and had half a bag left which I decided to grind and take along. Brewed a cup using Aeropress, roughly 16 gms of coffee measured using the AP scoop, I had no access to a scale, having forgotten mine at home. I did have a thermometer though, poured 220ml at 88C (measured with an old trusty travel mug). 

Took a sip and found myself transported for a moment to tranquility, it was probably the most balanced brew I had ever made, even with the eyeballed coffee measure. Hints of acidity, not too much, just right, little floral, and sweet. The sweetness was what stood out to me, it was later balanced out by a just a bit of pleasant bitterness, but the initial sweetness stayed as an aftertaste. I would love having this daily as an evening pick me up.

These always tasted like a mushroom soup and got bland after just a few steeps but were enough to get me intrigued. 

After browsing this sub for a while the new kuura shous caught my eye so I got one of each as my introduction into puer. I can't lie I got somewhat carried by the hype and the marketing but since it wasn't like I was piling up tea I didn't worry too much about it. 

When the cakes arrived I remembered it being recommended to let them rest a bit before brewing but I decided to try some to get an idea of their taste before resting. I tried cola first due to it being the cheapest one so I felt more at ease when experimenting with it. I brewed 6g of tea with ~80ml boiling water in a gaiwan starting at 20 seconds per steep.

The tea took a good while to arrive so I expected the flavor to be a bit weird from shipping. The first cup had a pleasant caramel scent but sipping it was quite a surprise since it tasted like a wet ashtray - dusty and somewhat bitter and paper like. The next cups had a nice chocolate and fruit scent and the bitter and dusty taste began to resemble burnt coffee and then a dark beer and old towels. At around the 9th cup the bitterness subsided and the tea got this fruity, sweet and slightly mineral taste that I could call pleasant without any reservation. By the 16h cup even 10 minutes of steeping could only get a watery tea so I stopped brewing there. Overall an interesting experience and if anything was learned it is that I'll let the tea rest for a while to see if the initial ashy taste goes away.

I politely thanked him, and he started talking to me, no weird vibes, just casual, so we chatted for a few minutes, him asking where I was from and if I had any recommendations for places there to visit since he might be visiting it soon, etc. To be honest it was a perfectly fine, nice conversation, and at the end he asked if I had an Instagram so we could keep in touch. My instagram is private and only for my friends so I said no. Then he asked if there was any way to reach me and I said well there's [popular messaging app]. He was like oh okay cuz maybe we can get coffee or something, we traded contact info and he left. 

Now I'm regretting it because although I enjoyed the conversation and was happy to chat with him I didn't find him attractive at all, so based on past experience I started to get the feeling that maybe I should never have traded contact info with him in the first place. But of course, he didn't *really* ask for a date or ask about my romantic interest, and I wouldn't mind being friendly (I like talking to people!) but socially I feel like it'd be naive to think that he would go though this trouble to not have at least a bit of hopeful romantic intentions in mind. But again, he never gave me a good opening to say so, so all I can think about is how I don't want him to get the impression that I ever led him on. 

What is the best way to handle these sorts of situations? This has happened to me more than once, so I just want to know, at what point is the line? Should I wait for him to make some mention of something romantic to tell him I have no intentions of anything romantic with him, or do I just head it off by saying so unprompted?

I lost 3 pounds and my face is thin as hell. Other than that, I am having very vivid dreams to which I routinely wake up to around 2-3 AM. They aren't necessarily around drinking (and other drugs) and not necessarily bad/nightmares, but drinking and drugs sometimes play a role. Mainly, I am just dreaming a shitton which is unusual. The dreams are sometimes weird as well, but I am completly neutral to this phenomenom. Only the waking up part is annoying.

I am drinking 0-2 NA beers every day, but mainly because I also don't drink soda, coffee, tea or anything else. So I usually treat myself with a NA wheat beer in the evening (can recommend). It's a lifesaver for me, and I don't  attribute it to alcohol per se at all. I just like the taste, and it tastes even better without alcohol.

Other than that, working out 5-7 times a week (gym and cycling). Meeting friends, being the prophet of sobriety. 

Had a couple of rough days last weekend, but didn't crave any drinks at all. It's probably the season.

I‚Äôve had symptoms since my teenage years but always heard I was just lazy or trying to get out of doing something so I‚Äôve learned to take a lot of pain medicine and drink plenty energy drinks/coffee. So on to my issue and it‚Äôs a weird one for me. 
I had my first ‚Äúofficial‚Äù flare up back in January after giving birth to my daughter and after a few weeks of ER and Dr visits I had bloodwork and was referred to a rheumatologist. He was very polite and for the first time ever actually listened to my symptoms and concerns. After a battery of blood and other tests he diagnosed me with SLE. His office then informed me that he was leaving the practice and I‚Äôd be place with his colleague for my return visit. 
Well shes not so caring and kind of mean but with a sweet sickly voice. She informed me that she didn‚Äôt think I had SLE but only psoriatic arthritis and that my other symptoms could be explained by other problems like low vitamin D and not enough exercise. So I was back at square one and feeling so bad about myself. My sister has lupus and my aunt passed from lupus complications so I thought I had finally found an explanation to my problems. It‚Äôs weird but I was finally relieved to know why my body hated me, now it feels like she‚Äôs telling me I‚Äôm lazy again (I work in a warehouse lifting, squatting, and tearing my body up btw). 
Well I wake up to a message from her office saying I need to go to get more labs and that she‚Äôs not taking SLE off the table just yet. It feels like this lady has me on a ping pong table going back and forth and I‚Äôm spinning. She‚Äôs already put me on immunosuppressants and prednisone so will I be on more meds now? 
 I don‚Äôt feel like I can trust her anymore, but it did take over 6 months to get into this office. 
So my question is, should I get a third opinion or is this common when getting diagnosed?",1,1731588726.0,lupus,0,1.0,False

1gr40n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/1gr40n9/ever_had_a_dream_call_back_to_a_previous_dream/,Ever had a dream call back to a previous dream?,"Last night I woke up from a dream at 1am in a cold sweat from a commitment I had made six months ago, but failed to keep.

It started off like any normal dream. You know, the typical ‚Äúresidual memories from the day‚Äù shit. I was in a restaurant, eating with some friends, had a weird interaction with the waiter who took my food too soon and gave me the stink eye when I asked where my plate went. The manager was cool about it though, he said he‚Äôd take care of it and comped me some more fries.

Anyway, I leave to go home and I find myself on a familiar road. As I‚Äôm driving, I‚Äôm like hey, I know this place. This curve leads to an intersection where there‚Äôs a Shell gas station and if I turn left and go up the hill, that‚Äôs where Jim and Nancy live.

Oh yeah, Jim and Nancy. I met them about six months ago at a random Starbucks. I was reading and having a coffee and they struck up a nice conversation. Cute older couple. They were talking about how they were about to go on vacation and needed someone to feed their dog and two cats while they were away. 

I turned left and went up the hill and, as dreams do, was suddenly warped to their backyard. 

Now, this was the middle of winter and snow was everywhere. Out the corner of my eye I see this little white, mangy looking Boston Terrier run by the patio. As I walk up to the back door there is this cute, but obviously freezing little kitten curled up on the door mat. Then comes the big black cat. He starts jumping and clawing on my leg like he knows me.

It‚Äôs In that moment it dawns on me that I had agreed to take care of their pets while they were in Arizona for the winter. 

I fumbled for my keys. I desperately tried to recall the instructions and then I remembered Nancy had emailed me everything. The instructions, the alarm code, why I had to go through the back sliding door instead of the front‚Ä¶ 

I searched my email and found the instructions because Jim and Nancy had a combined email - you know how older married couples are. Jim ‚Äúplus sign‚Äù Nancy @ hotmail.com. I‚Äôm pretty sure they shared a facebook account too.

Anyway, as I‚Äôm searching my email, the big cat keeps going at my leg. I get it you‚Äôre hungry buddy. I‚Äôm so sorry I haven‚Äôt been here! You and your friends are cold, hungry, alone, abandoned, and that‚Äôs all my fault! I feel terrible and I want to get you inside, get you warm and fed, let you know that not all humans are terrible people who leave you outside in the winter for six months.

Then I realize he‚Äôs not showing affection toward me. He‚Äôs trying to swat at the rabbits foot on my keychain.

That‚Äôs when I realize it‚Äôs a dream. I don‚Äôt have a rabbits foot on my keychain.

As I sat up in bed I had a moment of realization that I had actually dreamed about making this commitment to Jim and Nancy in another dream I had six months ago.

Also Jim and Nancy aren‚Äôt real, they only exist in this series of dreams that I only remember when I actively dream them. 


And that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like to have ADHD.",2,1731588547.0,adhdmeme,1,1.0,False

Hey there, coffee lovers and photography enthusiasts! If you're looking for a conversation starter that combines your love for coffee with your passion for photography, then let me introduce you to the **Camera Lens Mug**. This mug is not just a quirky design piece; it‚Äôs a practical product that makes your daily coffee routine a little more exciting.

## What's So Special About the Camera Lens Mug?

### Dual Lid Designs for Every Coffee Situation

One of the coolest features of this camera lens mug is its **two lid designs**. Here‚Äôs how they work:

- **Translucent Fully Closed Lid**: This lid ensures that your favourite brew doesn‚Äôt leak, making it perfect for those on-the-go moments.
- **Retractable Lid**: This allows you to sip your drink without having to remove the lid, which is super convenient when you‚Äôre multitasking.

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I've spilled coffee while trying to juggle my camera gear and my morning cup of joe. With this mug, those days are behind me!

### Perfect Capacity for Your Coffee Fix

The Camera Lens Mug boasts a capacity that‚Äôs just right:

- **13.5 oz** of liquid without the lid
- **11 oz** when the lid is securely attached

Whether I‚Äôm at home or on a shoot, this mug fits perfectly in my hand and in my bag. It‚Äôs lightweight and easy to carry, making it my go-to travel companion for caffeine boosts.

## Meticulous Design Meets Premium Quality

Let‚Äôs talk about the construction. This isn‚Äôt just any mug; it‚Äôs made from high-quality **stainless steel** on the inside and **food-grade ABS plastic** on the outside. 

- **Outstanding Insulation**: Your drinks will stay hot or cold for longer, which means fewer trips to the microwave!
- **Durability**: You can take this mug anywhere without worrying about it getting damaged.

I‚Äôve dropped mine a couple of times (who hasn‚Äôt?), and it still looks brand new!

## Multi-Functional Masterpiece

This mug isn‚Äôt just for coffee. You can also use it as a:

- **Creative Pen Holder**: Perfect for your desk setup.
- **Coin Jar**: Keep your spare change organised.
- **Unique Vase**: Add a touch of creativity to your home decor.

The possibilities are endless, and I love how it sparks creativity in everyday use.

## Perfect for Any Occasion

The Camera Lens Mug makes for a fantastic gift. Whether it‚Äôs for:

- **Photographers and Filmmakers**: A cool addition to their gear.
- **Coworkers**: A unique Christmas present or a fun gift for Mother‚Äôs Day and Father‚Äôs Day.
- **Kids**: Perfect for the budding photographer in your life.

It‚Äôs not just a novelty item; it‚Äôs practical and fun!

1gr3wn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reduction/comments/1gr3wn5/south_korea_breast_reduction_experience/,South Korea Breast Reduction Experience,"I just had my breast reduction surgery in Korea with Doctor Kim Kuylhee at Kangdong Hospital. I couldn‚Äôt find much information about traveling to Korea for this type of surgery, so I wanted to share my experience to help others.

**TLDR:** I had my breast reduction with Dr. Kim at Kangdong Hospital, which has an LGBTQ+ center offering breast reductions and gender reassignment surgeries. Dr. Kim is fluent in English, kind, and talented. The surgery is done in a hospital, not a clinic, and you‚Äôll stay there afterward for post-op care. I stayed in Korea for a little over three weeks to complete all pre-op tests and post-op follow-ups.

**The longer version:** I flew to Korea in November 2023 and visited three clinics. The first two were typical plastic surgery clinics, but Dr. Kim‚Äôs practice stood out because it was based in a hospital, which felt much safer. During my consultation with her, she really took the time to think about how my breasts would look post-surgery. She wasn‚Äôt rushing through or trying to ‚Äúsell‚Äù me on the surgery‚Äîshe genuinely cared about what I wanted.

¬†Here‚Äôs why I chose Dr. Kim over the others:

1. Trust and communication: Dr. Kim is fluent in English and easy to talk to.
2. Hospital setting: The surgery is done in a proper hospital, and you stay there for a few days afterward. Other clinics sent patients to nearby hotels the next day, which didn‚Äôt feel safe‚Äîespecially in a foreign country.
3. Queer-friendly environment: Her clinic is part of an LGBTQ+ center attached to the hospital, which made me feel comfortable and understood. She completely got what I meant when I said I wanted my breasts to match my androgynous style.

Once I decided to move forward, I communicated with the clinic via email to schedule the surgery and understand the overall timeline and process. I arrived about a week early for pre-op testing, which included a full panel, consultations with specialists, and imaging (like a mammogram and ultrasound). Dr. Kim wanted to ensure everything was in order before the surgery, and her thoroughness put me at ease. She also sent any lumps removed in the surgery to the lab for testing to make sure nothing was cancerous which was important to me. Overall, the surgery cost about 10 million won.

Before the surgery, I had a final meeting with Dr. Kim to finalize the breast design and then met with the anesthesiologist to go over the consent forms. The anesthesiologist didn‚Äôt speak English and relied on Google Translate, which made the process stressful. She moved through the forms way too quickly, and we had to ask her to slow down several times to ensure we understood everything. While I understand that choosing to have surgery in Korea meant dealing with a language barrier, my past experience in Japan was different‚Äîmedical institutions there often had on-site translators for a variety of languages especially in Tokyo. I wish Kangdong Hospital had offered a similar service to ease the communication challenges much like the beauty clinics in Seoul.¬†

On the day before surgery, I checked into the hospital with my partner. Heads up: Once you‚Äôre admitted, you can‚Äôt leave your room, so make sure you prepared for that beforehand. The hospital room had three other beds‚ÄîI tried to get a double room, but despite several attempts, it didn‚Äôt work out. The first night, my neighbors were friendly, but later on, some were noisy. The nurses helped by turning off their loud show after we asked though and they were quiet afterwards. I recommend having someone with you if possible, and it‚Äôs already included in the total cost. They provided a folding cot, but you‚Äôll need to bring your own blanket and pillow. To be honest, the sleeping arrangement and sharing the room were much better than I expected. I was worried we‚Äôd feel uncomfortable or that people would be too loud, but most were respectful and even shared their snacks, and the bathroom was cleaned very frequently. They also had a hot water machine right outside the room, making it easy to prepare tea or fill up your water.

The nurses spoke little English, which was intimidating at times. Google Translate and ChatGPT were lifesavers. My advice: advocate for yourself, double-check what‚Äôs written in your medical profile (I caught some errors and had to correct them), and don‚Äôt hesitate to speak up. People were a bit rough but kind‚Äîlike New Yorkers. Despite the language barrier some of the nurses went out of their to make sure I was accommodated as best they could and were patient when trying to understand what I needed.

Surgery was early the next morning (day 2). When I woke up, I was in a recovery room where the nurses monitored me coming out of anesthesia.  Btw they use a catheter since its a longer surgery. After that, I was moved back to my room. Not gonna lie, the first day was painful, but the painkillers definitely helped. You‚Äôll leave surgery attached with a Hemovac drain to reduce the risk of hematomas and help the skin heal faster. The Hemovac drain is used instead of the traditional drain bags attached to you so it made it easier to move and walk around.

The hospital stay included three days (pre-op day, surgery day, and the day after), but I chose to stay six days because I felt safer under the doctor‚Äôs care. Honestly, it was pretty comfortable, and the free Wi-Fi worked really well. The food started off bland (which is fine since you won‚Äôt have much of an appetite), but later I switched they switched to the Korean menu, which was way better than the Western one. They have a coffee shop, bakery, and CU in the hospitals lobby so you'll have options.

When I was discharged on day five, they changed my dressings and wrapped me in compression bandages, which I had to keep on for about a week until my follow-up appointment. During this time, you can‚Äôt shower. I was also given antibiotics and pain killers but make sure to ask for anti histamines because you will feel itchy from the dressing.¬†

During my next follow-up, Dr. Kim replaced the dressings with waterproof ones, but I still waited a couple more days before showering based on her recommendation, just to be safe. At this point, I was only wearing my sports bra along with the waterproof bandage stickers. My final visit on day 16 included stitch removal, one session of laser scar treatment, silicone gel, and I flew home the next day.

**Overall:** Dr. Kim listened carefully to what I wanted and worked with me during the design stage to refine the look. I sent her a ton of pictures, and she helped me figure out what would work best. At one point, my partner even joked that Dr. Kim understood my vision better than I did. Her attention to detail and genuine care made me feel confident throughout the entire process, even with the language barriers between me and the staff. Having the surgery in a hospital gave me peace of mind in case anything went wrong. Her main resident, Dr. Lee, was also very kind, spoke English well, and provided support whenever needed. That said, I wish the hospital had an on-site translator. I‚Äôve lived in Japan, where many clinics and hospitals offer this service, and having one would‚Äôve significantly reduced my anxiety during the stay. That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt consider it a dealbreaker, primarily because I felt that Dr. Kim was a talented surgeon, spoke English fluently, and understood how I wanted my breasts to look. I would definitely recommend her to someone looking to have their surgery in Korea.

I wrote this review because I know how hard it can be to find inclusive and talented doctors especially if you‚Äôre LGBTQ+ in Asia. I hope this helps anyone considering breast reduction surgery in Korea! Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.¬†

But first I have always had some form of anxiety disorder or depression I was never sure. But it has made my symptoms almost un treatable and un manageable even with medication.

 But anyway I am really not sure if this part is the wegovy or part of a whole  different  infection I've had and not been able to get treated due to it not showing up on tests etc.... and if that's the case i don't know what to even do. I am even worried if I go to the ER and tell them  I am on wegovy they won't even take the infection seriously also...  They'd just say well vomiting is common on wegovy etc ....

  I haven't been able to eat meat or full food or meals in over a year but the past 48hours I haven't been able to even keep down water and have thrown up a bunch of different times twice being brown coffee ground looking things is this common on wegovy or could this be something else?

It seems that the warmer stays hot in the U.S. for 100 minutes, which is closer to the 2 hours that we are accustomed to.  Thanks everyone!

Our current coffee maker (a Mr. Coffee) keeps the warmer on for 2 hours, which works well for us since my wife wakes up later than I do (but not at a specific time).

We would like to try getting a better coffee maker, and I'd prefer having a glass carafe.

Originally I was looking at a 12-cup Ninja, but now I'm thinking about getting a Moccamaster the next time it's on sale. Since I'd prefer a glass carafe I was looking at either the KB or the KBGV. The only problem is that they only keep the warmer on for 40 minutes, which is not long enough for us. Can it be set to stay warm for LONGER than 40 minutes? Or am I best off going with the Ninja?

At the end of the day, he invited me to have dinner with him (which wasn‚Äôt part of our original plan), and he introduced me to one of his best friends that night. He called me his girlfriend and was very respectful throughout the entire time.

Then, we had sex that night. Afterward, he returned to his country for several job meetings. We continued to communicate between days. Apparently, we share similar goals, and he‚Äôs open to a relationship. He had begun sending me some ‚Äúcute‚Äù videos on social media (since we‚Äôre on WhatsApp and Instagram). He‚Äôs also coming back to see me in two to three weeks. 

Today, I don‚Äôt see any red flags. He‚Äôs open about many topics. (I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs still on dating apps or not.) I‚Äôve already deleted Bumble. We‚Äôve only had two FaceTime video calls. 

Im afraid of being in a situationship (not sure what the signals are) or that he has also other girls from my country like in this ‚Äútalking phase‚Äù. (Cause I saw on his IG that he follows other girls from my same country/state as well)‚Ä¶. 

I had been w a narcissist in my last relationship for over 2 years so I‚Äôm still a little bit traumatized.

Should I wait until he comes and ask him? Should I wait for him to ask me? I‚Äôm not sure how to do this without seeing a bit crazy lol.

Well, after a few weeks I started working at the local pub and it became impossible to take the trays out whenever I did a drink with a customer or when I snacked while working.

I decided to start experimenting on the day before changing or a few days before if I wasn't planning on seeing anyone to see if it's actually that bad to drink other liquids but water with the trays.

I found out actually most drinks are perfectly fine, best case it doesn't affect at all, worst case it very slightly stains (visible while off, not visible while wearing it).

List of drinks I tried-
Different kinds of juices and sodas, beer, different kinds of cocktails, wine (red wine makes the tray slightly less transparent), coffee (not too hot). So basically, almost every drink lol.

Thought some of you may appreciate it as it makes it much less limiting if you're having a night out and don't want to take it out between drinks and such.

A typical closing shift, which is what I work, is 4 hours. Closing shifts already involve being locked in after business hours (usually for the last hour of our shift) and having to wait for the duty manager to close down, collect their things, perform their checks, unlock the doors, check our bags on the way out and have us stand by while closing the shutters. The duty managers don't get any of this finished in time for the end of our actual shift, and some actually seem to wait until the minute the shift is supposed to end before even *starting* any of this. So if for example our shift finished at 21:00 we're usually not outside the front door and free to start walking home until like 21:10.

I don't love this, I've never had a job where my time gets held hostage like this, but everybody seemed to accept this as normal and fine when I started so I do too. The managers I regularly work with are pretty reasonable and easy going people so I'm not out for cause trouble over a relatively minor work culture issue. I just make sure I down tools at 21:00 (never leaving a mess) and dick around on my phone while waiting to be allowed to leave.

But recently the management have been on a mission to ""reset expectations"" about timekeeping and reminding us that we are required to be in the office 4-5 minutes before the hour to have our team huddle, so that at 17:00 we can immediately get straight into our tasks as discussed in the huddle. We have been told off for being ""late"" for filing into the back office *ready to start* at 16:59 when our shifts on the rota don't start until 17:00. Or, even more annoyingly, the other day I went to get myself a glass of water from the staff kitchen before starting the other day and was summoned to the office because ""It's time to start"". I figured I'd lost track of time but when I saw my watch after walking into the office it was 16:54. If that wasn't bad enough, I've noticed the system clock in all the offices is actually 2 minutes fast. So I'm being told I'm late when I'm actually 6 minutes early, because management go by that clock. Bear in mind, I'm not talking about walking through the front door of the store at 17:00 still wearing a coat and bag and drinking a coffee. We are being scolded for actually being in the office and ready to start at our correct start time. Oh and sometimes the team huddle is so short that they end up dismissing us and telling us to get started on our tasks before our shift was even supposed to begin??

Am I being unreasonable for thinking that it's not my problem if they're annoyed that their team huddle cuts into the amount of time we can spend doing our tasks? They pay me for 4 hours, why is it not their job to work their team huddle into that 4 hours? A mandatory team huddle is work, so why am I being told I must do this on my own time? It may sound petty but I resent that they're treating arriving to work on time, or even early (but not early enough) is misconduct. Especially when being made to come in early and forced to come in late is kind of pushing our pay below the NLW at this point? So far I'm not aware of anybody being sanctioned over this but I suspect that's only because everybody has just gone along with it.

If I'm not being unreasonable, is there a good way to push back on this if I get into trouble for not coming in early?",5,1731586773.0,HumanResourcesUK,17,0.86,False

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

1gr3fvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/caregivers/comments/1gr3fvn/caregiver_isolation/,Caregiver Isolation,"Caregiving is a demanding unpaid job for a family caregiver. It often leads to a feeling of isolation, especially if you are used to socializing. Going out to dinner with friends, happy hour after work on Friday, or simply sitting in the backyard for a long chat are activities a caregiver often doesn't have time for unless they thoughtfully examine ways to overcome isolation that comes with caregiving. It is even more difficult for the long-distance caregiver.

# How Can a Caregiver Overcome Isolation?

1. Reach out to family and friends. Making connections and staying in contact with family and friends can help combat feelings of isolation. A cousin, a friend of the family you just met, or someone who comes into the home occasionally from an agency for in-home care.

Talking to anyone and everyone you meet can become a lasting relationship. Easier said and done for most. Connect with people in person: Friends, family members, and colleagues can be your best support system.

2. Connect with other long-distance caregivers. Talking to others who understand what you‚Äôre going through can be beneficial. Using technology to search for support groups nearby or online can produce avenues to explore opportunities for socialization. If you are. away from your spouse, use Skype or FaceTime to keep in touch for a more personal connection. Phone calls are always beneficial.

4. Taking a short walk when others are out walking allows connecting with other people. Maybe you'll find a group or a club, such as a book club, to join. Being informed and learning about the experiences of others can lead to support groups and online communities.

6. Practice self-care. Make sure to take care of yourself both mentally and physically. Eating nutritious meals, finding time to exercise, and getting plenty of rest are essential factors in maintaining good health. Taking time out for yourself helps give you the energy you need to tackle caregiving tasks.

7. Reach out and connect with other caregivers: Joining a support group or online community can be invaluable to caregivers, who can share problems, exchange advice and make valuable connections.¬†

8. Make time for yourself: practicing self-care will sharpen your focus to find ways to connect with others. Self-care should always be a priority. Therefore, try to prioritize social activities when you are feeling your best. Sometimes going somewhere on your own provides enough opportunities for socialization. Going to the local coffee shop, grabbing a bite to eat, or simply sitting or walking in the park.

Sometimes those opportunities are not there for you because you can't leave your loved one alone. But there are ways to do it all online. Call someone and have a cup of coffee while talking to them, whether it be a business or social call. Imagine yourself in the coffee shop while having a conversation over the phone.

9. Make social activities a priority: Make sure to include leisure activities into the weekly schedule, such as visiting a museum, going to a movie, or having coffee with a close friend. Seize those unexpected opportunities: Look for ways to add more social interactions into your day, such as attending free lectures, concerts or volunteering in the community.

10. Talk to a professional: It's essential to find a safe space to talk about the challenges of caregiving. Talking can help to process your feelings and relieve some of the stress and depression. Writing them down is just as therapeutic as talking to someone.

# In Conclusion

Finding a chatroom is difficult, especially if you are looking for one with similar interests. Chat For Caregivers is a chatroom for caregivers. Talking with others about mundane daily tasks can help you find the necessary connections. Try [chatforcaregivers.com ](https://rumbletalk.com/client/chat.php?6IsLz@SU)and see the difference it can make in diminishing your isolation.

Long-standing Le Creuset addict. Half our kitchen has been outfitted with pans, pots, utensils, cookware, coffee and tea cups. 

My beloved Dutch Oven - 26cm in Volcanic was identified as having crazing after I sent in pictures to customer service. As the consumer, I‚Äôm at fault. 

As goodwill they offer me a 30% discount code, however:

- It‚Äôs over $120 (equivalent) cheaper on Amazon
- With the discount code, it‚Äôs $20 (equivalent) more expensive on Le Creuset 
- You can‚Äôt use the discount code on Black Friday 
- They can‚Äôt budge on the 30% 
- No recommendation if I am safe to keep using the pot

As a customer, I really feel this is poor: 
- Why would I re-buy directly from them, when it‚Äôs more expensive? (You should have just skipped giving me a discount code) 

The only conclusion I can draw is not wanting to buy from them directly - there‚Äôs no incentive. 

I still get the warranty no matter where I‚Äôve purchased from. 

I‚Äôm better off with Amazon‚Äôs customer service. Because they understand that I‚Äôll help to increase their revenue through repeat business, if they handle the interaction appropriately with them.

1gr3dvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1gr3dvb/coworkers_to_friends_to_something_more/,coworkers to friends to- something more,"My coworker moved across the country to ditch an abusive relationship in August.

Now, I've been out of relationships for a while and have been happily single, so when this cutie starting working with me (both baristas) I chose to think nothing of it. I'm a little more reserved (can be outgoing but only in bursts) while she can and will tell every passerby that she loves their sweater, piercing, voice, camera, glasses, disposition... etc. Stack on this the fact that **she's a magnet and every person in the universe falls in love as soon as they meet her.** Because of her curiosity and intensity and dashing looks, she'll draw plenty of unwanted attention; but she can take care of herself. I watched one coworker put the moves on her. She shut it down quick. As an introvert I love, so much, watching her meet the world.

**I was entirely indifferent to her (romantically)**. I simply enjoyed her company and openly let her know how much I did. She insisted I start working the evenings with her and I saw no reason to say no. After a few months we started grabbing grub and sitting on the trunk of her car, chatting til the clock ticked 12. We called them girl dinners. We'd stare with a smile and hug and leave. At this point I realized I liked her.

**I KNOW. How could it not be obvious? pffff. Idk I have a shell I guess.**

I'm in a creative writing class and used this opportunity to write a poem about my feelings  hidden pretty discretely into a story about walking through the Mojave and running into a displaced flower that speaks to me... it's a whole thing. Anyway I sent it to her to drop a hint.

One night we took a walk together and I couldn't take it anymore and told her the poem was about her. She said ""*I was starting to think I'd have to make the first move""*. I apologized, knowing fully well that she wasn't fully healed from her last relationship. I made it clear that I didn't pursue her from the get-go and that all this happened by chance. She then told me she'd crushed on me for a while, too. Still, **we agreed not to kiss.**

In one of string txts she told me how much she loved my physical touch and I told her that I'd be happy to ramp it up appropriately. Our coffees would get a little touchy but then on an official ""date"" we went to a botanical garden and I felt her retract-- or maybe not retract but simply not respond to any of my gestures and I felt so embarrassed for having tried. I told her before we parted and honestly, she didn't say much in response. I was so sure she just lost all feelings for me. That was a rough sleep.

I got a text the next morning saying how much she wanted to keep me in her life but wasn't ready for anything romantic (explaining a little more later that at night her butterflies were often chased by horrifying memories of her abusive ex). I texted back immediately so as to not play games or leave big conversations hanging: *""totally understood, I can't promise that I won't be awkward at work tonight, but I'll try my best"".* Those shifts were indeed awkward.

She approached me one night and asked if I hated her. I explained that I thought I'd accidentally crossed a boundary, that I was embarrassed... she stopped me:

>**""People usually say they're not ready as an excuse, but this time you need to believe that I still like you. It really is just too soon""**

So I started over. I gave her another book from our ongoing book exchange, and continued txting like old times. Today I studied and she read next to me at a cafe. A stranger asked if we were on a date during one of our talking breaks and we laughed and said we were trying to rewire our brains to \*not\* be on a date because we want to stay friends.

This is getting long but I hope you like this story as much as I do. **I obviously still have feelings for her.** I love watching her gab. I love taking study breaks to sit face-to-face and talk our ears off. I'd be lying if I said backtracking wasn't hard, but I know it's the right thing to do. What are things I can do to take control of my thoughts when feelings get intense? How honest should I be about my feelings? Should I take a break from her??",0,1731586300.0,CasualConversation,1,0.5,False
