**Why This Pick?**

Oklahoma City has bagged at least 125 points in 4 of their last 5 encounters with Memphis, friends. Let’s be honest – we all saw Game 1. The odds of the Grizzlies finding a way to slow down Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and company are unlikely. Even funnier, SGA only bagged 15 points in Game 1 and they still flew over 121.5 points. While the Grizzlies might find a way to cover (that’s a big “might”…) it won’t be because they slow the Thunder down, it’ll be because they find a way to keep up. I’m on the Thunder to bag at least 122 points here.

What Got Done Today

So remember yesterday’s plan?
1. Alarm sounds –  Done!
Now, whether you're on the timer page or the dashboard, you'll hear a soft but stern “get back to work, buddy” beep when your session ends. My ears are both grateful and slightly anxious. Success.

2. Timer bugs –  Squashed.
The timer is now behaving like a civilized citizen. Previously, it was drifting, stalling, or just going on mysterious coffee breaks. Not anymore.

3.Tab closed = timer paused? –  Not today, Satan. We now support persistent timing. So even if you close the tab, shut your screen, or launch into the void, your timer keeps ticking. Actual time-tracking, with accurate calculation and minimal drift. Fancy math included. No biggie.

4. Lemon Squeezy integration – 🍋 Getting there.
We got the API keys and approval, so now it’s just me vs. the docs. If my eyes don’t melt first, I might get it done today.


The Reddit Mod Saga
Tried posting yesterday’s update to a couple of subreddits... and uh... got yeeted by mods. Hard. Still not sure what ancient subreddit law I violated, but if you’re reading this, mods: I hydrate, I code, and I come in peace. That said one community actually gave the post some love. It was small, but seeing strangers resonate with my dev struggles? That hit was different. I’m officially emotionally invested. But yeah, managing posts + codebase = chaos. If you're wondering what it feels like to context-switch between bug fixes and Reddit guidelines... imagine debugging and applying for a visa at the same time.


CHECK-IN 
Today was a good day. I planned it with PMWD, and tracked my focus blocks. We take those wins. Also: water was consumed. Multiple times. Hydration is the hill I’m willing to live on.
That’s a wrap for Day 2. Tomorrow I’ll (hopefully) have the Lemon Squeezy integration ready, and maybe just maybe I’ll find a subreddit that lets me exist in peace.
Thanks for being here. I might give somebody little motivation to live on Reddit before bed.

To start, I’m a very Type A bride. We interviewed dozens of wedding planners before finally choosing this one because she had experience with our venue (including hosting multi-day events there), offered to officiate our wedding, and seemed to have a personality that matched ours. However, since hiring her, it’s been a mess and a major headache.

Her communication is all over the place. Instead of responding to emails in an existing thread, she starts new threads randomly, which makes it nearly impossible to keep track of everything. We've been trying to book a caterer for months, but her communication has been abysmal. She initially offered to negotiate pricing on chairs and the open bar with one caterer. I asked her to do so, but she never followed up. Instead, she suggested a different caterer that would save us slightly more money. I asked her a few questions about their open bar policy, but I haven’t gotten a response.

Ultimately, I decided I wanted to go back to the first caterer because of their reputation and more inclusive pricing (cake, coffee, and desserts were included, unlike the other option’s per-person pricing). I’ve let her know this, but I still haven’t received a response. Meanwhile, we’re going way over budget on catering, and I feel like hiring a planner was supposed to prevent situations like this. I’ve even started reaching out to other caterers on my own. One of them, pre-approved by our venue but ignored by our planner, turned out to be in the same price range as the two she had initially suggested.

While this catering fiasco has been dragging on, my fiancé and I decided to move forward with booking some other vendors, particularly a photographer, HMUA, and videographer, since we were told that catering was the main priority and that we had flexibility in choosing other vendors. We booked a photographer and HMUA, and the planner didn’t have any issues when we let her know ahead of time.

However, she has now suddenly asked us to stop reaching out to vendors and let her handle everything. I would honestly love for her to take charge, but she takes at least a week to respond to emails, doesn’t answer all of my questions, and doesn’t provide quotes in a timely manner.

At this point, I’ve honestly had it. I can’t even imagine someone I’m this annoyed with officiating our wedding. My fiancé is hesitant to start over, but I don’t see any way to salvage this. Thankfully, our wedding is still over a year away, so we have time to pivot if necessary. I’m hoping she’ll refund most or all of the deposit since there’s nothing in the contract about it being non-refundable.

Should I try giving her another chance, or should I just cut my losses and start over with a new planner?",3,1745337947.0,BigBudgetBrides,5,1.0,False

1k5a12n,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k5a12n/removing_crema_how_do_you_do_it/,"Removing Crema, how do you do it?","I've spent the last year or so researching and developing ways to remove crema from espresso. Like many of you, I saw the [James Hoffman YouTube video](https://youtu.be/XQ3TcpI2Lu8) that talked about how removing it makes a much better americano. After experimenting, I've come to similar. I generally prefer the crema when it comes to an americano or milk drink, but much prefer removing the crema when drinking espresso straight. The freshness and roast of the beans is also critical here though. 

It seems pretty well established here and on other internet coffee hubs that removing crema puts a pretty significant spin on your drink. Some say you sacrifice mouth feel in exchange for flavor, others say it's like cutting the crust off your sandwich... Anyways, I'm curious if any of you actively remove the crema, and how you do it. I've heard of using a spoon, using a filter, swirling to make the crema stick to the sides of your cup, etc... How do you guys do it? What's your take on your current method?

I'm working on a device to do this that's pretty far along in the works, and will probably post about it next Sunday, but it's still in a prototyping phase, and I want to see if I'm missing something. Maybe there's an easier or simpler way to do it.

My problem is that I dont know how to send parcels overseas, can my fellow Filipinos send me a guide on how to do so? And how much will it cost?

while you're at it, give me some advice on what to write in my first penpal too! 

And if you're interested in being my penpal, heres a little about me. 

I'm 16f, entp, and I live in the Philippines. I'm currently a highschool student, a journalist. I was formerly a science writer but now I'm doing column.

I don't play instruments or sports, and to be real with you I'm not that physically fit either.

I dont have favourite color because I like all colors! But I like cool toned colors best, like blue and purple, but I love pink and green too! I dont watch anime as often anymore, but I still watch apothecary diaries. As for my favorite singers, I cant say I have an ultimate fav, because I listen to literally everything!

I watch a lot of Chinese and Korean dramas, mr.sunshine absolutely ruined me for a while, it has such great characters but an absolutely heart breaking plot. I'd watch it for the first time again if I could tho.

I have a lot of hobbies, crocheting, journaling/scrapbooking, making air dry clay sculptures, coloring (not drawing lmao I cant do that)

My dream job is something in finance, but ultimately my goal is to be rich, in love and money.

I have a boyfriend, and he's the best!! We met at school, he's currently in Japan for summer break and I miss him so much 

I have three dogs (shih tzus) and a lot of stray cats wander in our property, but we dont really own them. 

My favorite drink is coffee, and my favorite food is anything potato. I think you'll agree with me on this when I say its the best!

You can expect me to send you little tidbits of my life in my letters, my thoughts on the world, other people, and a lot of other stuff! I am a certified yapper.

Im currently in summer break. I just finished 10th grade and I'm gonna be an 11th grader soon. I'm pretty excited about it! 

Well now I cant tell you everything right? That might spoil all the fun in the letters im gonna send. 

I'd love to make new friends.

As for what im looking for in my penpal buddy, I want someone near my age so we can relate to each other, preferably a girl too, but if you're a boy I totally wouldn't mind.

I'd prefer it too if we dont share social media accounts. I want us to know each other by the letters we send only.

If we come to trust each other enough though, that might change.

SBUX is up 2.4% today following analyst ratings 100-106 by Barclays, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. This company will be heavily impacted by tarriffs as your expensive beans don’t come from your grandpas farm in Kansas. If there’s an economic slowdown the first thing to go will be your 7$ cup of coffee on the way to work because you lost your job. Higher labor costs for the company caused by unions will continue to be a drag. Maxwell beans going to be selling like hotcakes as people look for cheaper coffee at DG. The bright spot is oil is cheap so the actual shipping cost may be less.

The stock is up about 2.4% right now and large order flow of sells is 2.92 million and buy sits around 1.5 million. If you’re into math that’s about 50% difference.

1k59vkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k59vkg/how_does_the_bayka_french_press_coffee_maker/,How does the BAYKA French Press Coffee Maker deliver rich coffee flavor review?,"I’ve been testing the BAYKA FPV3V107 French Press Coffee Maker for a while now, and I have to say, it’s a fascinating brewing tool. What initially caught my attention about this item was its sleek design and portability. It’s a coffee press that feels as much like an accessory as a functional part of my kitchen, and as someone who drinks more coffee in a week than some people do in a month, that's saying something.

**Design That Marries Function and Style**

This coffee press screams sophistication with its Dark Pewter metallic exterior. The borosilicate glass carafe adds both elegance and durability to the product, ensuring it looks great on any counter while surviving thermal shock without cracking. The design even allows you to watch your coffee brew, which is oddly satisfying if you’re into the ritual of coffee-making (and I definitely am). It’s compact yet spacious, making the 34-ounce capacity perfect for multiple servings, whether at home or during camping trips.

**Brewing Experience and Flavor Quality**

The first brew using this French press had me convinced that I’d been missing out on something special. Ground coffee is the required input, which worked great for me as I use a burr grinder for freshly ground beans. The 4-level filtration system is a standout feature—there’s practically no sediment at the bottom of my cup. The robust, smooth cup of coffee it delivers highlights the natural oils and aroma in a way drip machines simply can’t. It also works well for espresso and cold brew, which I find myself alternating between regularly.

[Check BAYKA FPV3V107 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b087ptw7f5/)

**Ease of Use**

Operating this manual coffee press is straightforward even if you’ve never used one. You just add coffee grounds, pour hot water, let it steep, and press down the plunger. No buttons, no settings, no complications! Cleaning it is equally simple; the borosilicate glass carafe can be easily removed for a rinse, and other parts like the plunger are dishwasher-safe. Pro tip—hand washing ensures it maintains its new look for longer.

**Advantages**

- Durable construction using borosilicate glass.
- Stylish metallic finish that complements modern kitchen aesthetics.
- The 4-level filtration system works wonders for sediment-free coffee.
- Dishwasher-safe parts make cleaning effortless.
- Large 34-ounce capacity suitable for larger households or gatherings.

**Negatives**

- The glass, while durable, might still feel fragile to users accustomed to stainless steel presses.
- Not insulated, so coffee doesn't stay hot for extended hours without transferring to a thermal carafe.
- The plunger spring may loosen slightly with frequent use.

**Comfort and Portability for All Occasions**

This coffee press isn’t just for the kitchen. Its portable build has proved to be perfect for travel, outdoor gatherings, or even a quick coffee fix at the office. I’ve taken it camping, and trust me, there’s nothing like sipping your favorite brew surrounded by nature. The lightweight body ensures it doesn’t become just “another thing to carry” in your backpack.

**Competing Products**

I’ve tried other French presses like the Bodum Chambord and the Frieling Stainless Steel Press. The Bodum’s slightly cheaper build is obvious, but it does the job if you want an entry-point product. Meanwhile, Frieling’s stainless steel model is pricier but better insulated. Where BAYKA stands out is in its balance—its high-quality glass design, excellent filtration, and affordability place it ahead of Bodum for aesthetics and Frieling for everyday convenience. Plus, the 34-ounce capacity trumps most standard options.

**True Value**

Is it worth the investment for its features? Absolutely. This coffee press manages to deliver a premium brewing experience at a price point that’s accessible. It’s built for people who care about the process of making coffee, from flavor to design. For anyone who has used lower-tier plastic models, this French press feels like a considerable upgrade. Whether you’re a casual coffee drinker or someone who grinds their beans obsessively, it offers excellent value.

I am looking to gain clarity without completely sacrificing body. Maybe not all the way over to SSP Multipurpose, but closer to that end.

Wish-list:

* Very good fit and finish, alignment, experience, workflow, etc
* Single dosing, low retention
* Flavor profile in the realm of ""great clarity, but still a little body""
   * 64mm burrs for optionality in the future

Leaders:

* Lagom P64 w/Mizen Omni
   * Essentially perfect, but I've read some reports here and there about minor retention
   * Variable RPM
   * Higher end of budget but not out of bounds
* Mazzer Philos w/I200D
   * She's a little big, and I think I'll find the rear dial awkward. I'm fairly tall and this will go below a cabinet, so I'll probably have to duck to see the markings
   * Has a tad more plastic than ideal
   * More affordable, could throw in another burr set 

Dark horses:

* Timemore 078SSP, 64S (reluctantly)
   * Bigger burrs
   * Lower end of price range
   * Unsure about quality/reliability, but I understand the 78 is a bit nicer than the 64
   * These burrs may be too clear (but there's room in the budget for another set, albeit with fewer options in this size)
* Zerno Z1 w/SSP Cast (sigh)
   * Almost perfect
   * Lead time, most expensive

Probably ruled out:

* Turin. I'm willing to pay more for a more refined grinder. I could almost go for the DF64V gen 2, but supply has dried up and the CF is ugly.",1,1745337342.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I enjoy cooking for peace of mind, used to like hiking trips(looking forward to resuming this hobby). I enjoy swimming and taking long walks. I try to survive this life with coffee.  I sometimes watch/re-watch anime , or listen to audiobooks or useless podcasts in weekends to pass time. Exploring new food/cuisine excites me more than watching a movie.

I currently don't have any pets, but love to adopt a cat some day.

I enjoy cooking as a hobby , I'm definitely not a professional. But I got into it as it reminds me of self  value and consistently put efforts to improve myself. It's ok if it sounds a bit boring, but this particular hobby helped me a lot with my anxiety issues and making a routine.


Starting conversation could be , just came up with these to start some Convo, but you can pick any different one
How do you handle this world in times of self doubt , as everything is tuned towards repelling introverted people?

What is the last time one of your friends pissed you off and how did you handle it?

Share two happy moments in the past month.

Confront or bury?,"TL,DR: I found messages on my bfs phone with a girl which are weird and messages with his mother, where he only complains about me. 

We are together since 4 years, im his first partner in all regards, hes not my first at all. the first 2 years were really good, i chose him because he seemed very kind, loyal and trustworthy and of course i like him as a person. the last two years have been extremely difficult, we fight a lot and i have some underlying mental health struggles and a physical disability. i find him to be very cold, when we fight and very unempathetic. and i at some point just get very insulting and blame him a lot, coming from a lot of childhood trauma, which i know is bad. we fight very dirty. and it doesnt seem to get better.

in 2023 i went through his phone the first time, because we had some problems. i know i shouldnt have. 
then i noticed he was writing with a girl we know (a friend from a male friend of his, she was at university with us) and they wrote back an forth, not outright flirting but definitely in a grey area. they met up for coffee and he didnt tell me about it. i confronted him and he git really angry that i snooped which i understand. he kind of apologized but not really. and then he put it like i want to forbid him to see her, like im that girl. but it was really hurting me how they write to each other. 
now after 1.5 years i looked again and theyre writing again more, and he asked her to meet again but it didnt happen so fsr, but he also didnt tell me again. 
and also i found some very disturbing content. they were making fun of non binary people and how those people are mentally ill…like a completely different side hes showing at home with me. i know he has difficulty understanding but never talking this badly about it. 
i also noticed that when he writes to his mother about me hes only complaining and telling her the bad stuff about me, never what nice thongs i do. which im very limited to right now because im doing really bad, but that really deeply made me sad.

Hey there, mystery human,

If you've made it this far into the post, first of all—congrats on your attention span. That’s rare these days and already a green flag. Second—maybe you're like me: tired of surface-level chats, ghostings after a good convo, and the weird limbo between “hey” and “do you want kids?”

So I figured I’d throw myself out there and write something actually real. No frills. No filters. Just me, looking to connect with someone who’s also craving something genuine, whether it starts with memes, music recs, or midnight oversharing.

About Me (aka: Who’s This Guy?)

29 | Based in Europe | Functioning Adult™
I work with people (sometimes the tiny kind, sometimes the chaotic kind) and it’s a job that’s taught me empathy, patience, and how to survive on zero sleep and too much coffee.

I’m an introvert by nature but warm up fast. Once I feel comfortable, I go from quiet thinker to “here’s a playlist I made that accidentally tells you too much about me.”

Here’s what keeps me going:

Music – My playlists go from soft indie ballads to aggressive boss battle themes and then back to lo-fi in under 3 tracks.

Movies – I’ll happily dissect a masterpiece or watch the worst rom-com on Netflix just for fun. Bonus points if you can quote bad dialogue with a straight face.

Gaming – I lean toward story-rich single-player adventures, but if you want to team up for something chaotic and hilarious, I’m in.

Books & Writing – I love getting lost in good fiction or oddly specific Wikipedia holes. I write when I can, even if it’s mostly half-finished Google Docs for now.

Creative things – Drawing, brainstorming, daydreaming. I'm in my “figure-it-out” era and loving the process.

Curiosity – I will absolutely watch a 40-minute video essay on a topic I’ll forget by next week—but I’ll be very passionate about it in the moment.



---

Who I’m Hoping to Meet:

I don’t have a long list or a rigid “type.” Honestly, I just want to talk to someone kind, curious, and open-minded—someone who wants to connect beyond “wyd.”

Bonus points if:

You enjoy silly, deep, or totally random conversations (or all three in one sitting).

You’re a fan of movie nights, music swaps, or virtual hangouts.

You can handle sarcasm, witty banter, and occasional existential spirals at ungodly hours.

You’re open to a relationship if the vibe’s right, and maybe even the idea of a family someday (no rush, no pressure—just openness).

You’re cool with exchanging pics when it feels natural, not weird.

You’re down to move to another chat platform if Reddit starts feeling like a weird third wheel.



---

Why Message Me?

Because you’re tired of talking to bots, dry texters, or people who vanish mid-convo.
Because you want someone who actually reads your replies.
Because you want to connect with someone who listens, laughs, and is willing to see where things go.
Because you're secretly a cat in human form. Or you just like cats. That works too.

At the very least, we might have a fun, thoughtful chat. At best? Well... let’s not spoil the ending just yet.

Yesterday, I showed off the AI Schedule Builder the part of PlanMyWorkDay.com that builds a rhythm-based schedule for you in seconds, using just four deeply personal questions (no horoscopes involved, promise). But what if the AI gets it 82% right… and you still wanna change that one weird 55-minute break it decided to throw in?
Enter today’s tool: The Schedule Builder.
🎛️ Total Control. No Coding Required.
Once the AI gives you a baseline, the Schedule Builder lets you go full architect mode:
⬆️ Move things up/down
📝 Rename anything
🔁 Swap a break for a focus block
💥 Or just delete stuff with the righteous fury of someone ignoring their calendar

I built this because I hate when tools feel like they’re trying to parent me. I said I want a break at 3:00 stop rescheduling it for 2:47 just because “science.”
So this builder exists to give YOU the final say.
The AI suggests.
You decide.
Bonus Feature: Quick Add Cards
Need to toss in a coffee break? A deep focus session? Your 30-minute midday existential crisis? We got cards for that.
And yes, you can add custom ones too even if you want to call it “Sit And Cry Into Keyboard” (15 min, therapeutic).


🧩 TL;DR:
The AI gives you the skeleton.
The Schedule Builder lets you flesh it out like a productivity necromancer.
Control freaks, rejoice. This one’s for you.
Peace, control, and caffeination.

when i go out/convenience store to buy drinks i am always only ever attracted to milk drinks and end up buying them even when theres so many other choices

everytime on board the flight attendant will ask me if i wanted coffee or tea, i will always ask “do you have milk?” and once my friend laughed at me saying “why do you ask for milk? like a baby🤣”

almost every other person or in shows are into coffee, bubble tea or matcha, soda etc but i am not into any of these.

i do regular medical checkups (i have a congenital heart condition so thats not the reason why i crave milk) and they say all my other stats are normal/fine so i dont have diabetes or lack of red blood cells or calcium, vitamins etc.

i know addiction is a problem and ive heard of so many weird addictions in the world so i wonder if i have an addiction as well?
am i the only one in the world thats like that? i have never met anyone else in my life that likes milk or drink it every day (as an adult). will there be any repercussions? i have never told anyone about it not even my doctor (it sounds weird and embarrassing)",1,1745336478.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Just wanted to share some interesting bits about [**Dark Web Monitoring**](https://www.safeaeon.com/dark-web-monitoring/) , something that sounds like a spy movie but is actually a pretty serious (and necessary) part of cybersecurity today. Here's a quick, fun, and informative breakdown:

🔍 **What is Dark Web Monitoring?**  
It's the process of scanning hidden parts of the internet, where search engines can't reach, to find if your **credentials, personal info, or company data** have been leaked or are up for sale.

💬 **Some Cool (and a little scary) Facts:**

* **Only 4%** of the internet is publicly accessible. The other **96%** (deep + dark web) is *hidden*!
* Credentials can sell for as little as **$1** on dark marketplaces. That's cheaper than a cup of coffee. ☕
* **On average, it takes 287 days** to detect a breach if you don't have monitoring tools in place.
* Hackers often bundle personal data like ""buy one, get one free"" offers. 🎁 (Name, email, credit card – all in one package.)

⚡ **Why Dark Web Monitoring Matters:**

* Early warning if your info is compromised.
* Helps prevent identity theft and fraud.
* Critical for companies to protect customer trust (and avoid lawsuits).

🤔 **Fun Thought:**  
Imagine someone finds your login credentials *before you do.* Now, imagine you *already* knew because your Dark Web Monitoring tool caught it first.  
Who's the real hacker now? 🧠💥

If you're serious about cybersecurity (whether personal or business), **keeping an eye on the dark web isn't optional anymore  it's survival**.

Stay safe out there, friends!  
Would love to hear if anyone has seen crazy/funny/weird stuff found through dark web monitoring too! 👇",1,1745336414.0,defentek,0,1.0,False
1k59foe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1k59foe/im_going_crazy/,I’m going crazy.,"Early November I had lots of stomach pain, farting, burping… 
I went to an urgent care and they sent me home told me to take miralax.. well I thought that was very stupid and didn’t. After Thanksgiving I went to a new urgent care and they tested me for h pylori.. I was positive and went through two treatments for it.. march 5th I finally had a negative test. 

Fast forward to today and I don’t have stomach pain any longer.. I did have stomach pain last week after taking an antibiotic on empty stomach like an idiot. The antibiotic was for something completely different. 
I have excessive burping and gas production lol. I pass gas literally all day, even when I don’t eat. 
I do not have pain though like I used to have under left rib cage. 

I assume I have gastritis, I stopped taking PPI because it causes me severe headaches so my dr recommended Pepcid. I have been taking Pepcid for a few days now. 

Does anyone have gastritis like this? No pain, just gas and burps all day? It’s weird. I have a scope appointment in a few weeks, never had one done. It was a fight just to get this one. My GI doesn’t seem to think h pylori causes gastritis and that I must be a chronic alcoholic or pill popper. 🙄
She kept questioning whether I do those things. She also said notes of my CT scan said I was backed up with stool, nothing says that. I think she just thinks I’m young and stupid and wants to shove me out. My CT scan I had in February and it was unremarkable, nothing found at all. 

I just am scared 24/7, I always hope it’s nothing worse. I’ve had a supraclavicular node on left side swollen for months, it appeared a month before I started having bad symptoms initially. I had a US of it few days ago and the dr isn’t concerned at all, it’s 1cm long and only 4mm wide. It had its fatty helium and it doesn’t seem to grow or shrink. Just has felt the same to me for months. Maybe I assume it’s just still there from chronic inflammation and I was fighting an infection (h pylori). My CRP weeks ago was a 7. 

Has anyone had anything similar? I’m so done stressing myself out over my health 24/7. It’s hard not to I already have really bad anxiety. I am just tired of doing it to myself and in a constant state or worry. 

I don’t eat horrible but I do drink coffee in the morning, it’s my only joy at the moment is my cup of coffee. ",3,1745336397.0,Gastritis,4,1.0,False

I'm now 2 weeks exactly today, and I'm back to normal... well infact better than normal! 

I kept it low fat for 8 days, then I tried some butter in a cafe and I survived, I then tried some chocolate on Sunday as it was Easter, I survived again. Today I've tried fried chicken (my biggest fear) I'm about half hour out, so far so good... no pains(well apart from a killer period) 🤦🏻‍♀️ 
I'm pretty sure my period is heavier apparently it's normal after surgery?!? Anyways, my period is more painful than the surgery if you wanted pain symptoms. 

I'm still suffering with constipation but I am diagnosed with (slow transit constipation) butt... I have been pooping maybe every other day, it's like hot lavaaaa 🔥 not painful, not running to the bathroom, just when I go it's very dark and sloppy... but maybe it's helping? As before I'd go 10/14 days without opening my bowels... so I'll take that as a RESULT 😂 

I do have shooting pains after eating sometimes, it can be like a stabbing - but it doesn't last long. 

I've found out my taste buds have changed, and I really haven't missed chocolate or fried things, I've only tried them to see if I can eat more things as I'm bored shitless of the same things everyday. 

I still haven't trialled coffee as that was my biggest issue with the attacks and I'm terrified... I still definitely have a major fear of food, and although I am trying new things, I'm not being to adventurous or counting my lucky stars 🌟 quite yet, I know I'm early days. 

Please don't be scared of this op, it's a real life changer (and even though people suffer and I feel so sorry for them) the majority of people including me are too content now to be posting on these subs, but I promised I'd do another post for the people who wanted it... ❤️ 

I'll do another post over the next few weeks, and then maybe at 6m post op and a year ect!!

1k59bp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1k59bp5/trip_report_oman/,Trip Report - Oman,"I just finished an incredible solo week in Oman, and I'm shocked it's still off the radar for those outside of travel-oriented circles. The country offers so little of what I usually crave out of travel, but a Bourdain episode put a bug in my ear, and I wanted to experience the Middle East for the first time. I'm so glad I did. 

# Muscat: 4 total Days/Nights

Spend less time here unless you use it for a side trip base/0 days like I did.

**Al Ghubrah/Al Khuwayr area was a great first night stay** because it's close to the airport, easiest to drive, and has tons of malls and hypermarkets where I could stock up for my roadtrip. I wouldn't base myself here longer though.

**Qurum Beach is great for beach/pool lounging, luxury travel.** I stayed here 3 nights at the end in a high end hotel, but avoid if you want cheap/local feeling/walkability relative to Oman standards. 

**Highlights/Must-Dos**

* Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque (only open a few days between 8-11am, so plan accordingly, and go early)
* The Opera House
* Mutrah
   * Walk the Corniche
   * Visit the Fort
   * Shop at the Souq, go at night, haggle for 50-60% of price and don't budge, buy cool shit
   * Find the obscure ""Fountain"" location on the map, near the end of the main drag, watch the sunset (even better, moonrise) around that area
   * Most of you probably want to stay in this area

**Wadi Shab** is the one thing I wanted to do badly and simply didn't have the energy for. I'd have made it a Muscat day trip though, it's \~a 90 minute drive away, or you can take one of many tours via hotels, Viator, Get Your Guide, etc. They usually stop at Bimmah Sinkhole too.

**Daymaniyat Islands Day Trip:** Most tours depart from Al Seeb port, and cost between $75-$150 USD. They're lackluster in the tours themselves (terrible food, little structured activity, it's a glorified water taxi) but the islands are so beautiful, the water is perfect for swimming, and seeing turtles while snorkeling is a treat. Don't skip it.

# Nizwa: 1 Day/Night

This was rushed but fine for me. For most of you. I'd recommend doing all of this in at least 2 days/nights depending on how much time you can spend at historical sites (I'm the type where I can walk around for an hour and be totally happy). 

**Between Muscat and Nizwa, stop in Birkat Al Mouz.**

If you leave Muscat early you can spend your pre-check in hours in this amazing little village. 

The area is a banana plantation with crumbling ruins you can (carefully) walk through unguided, and for free. The views and old buildings are stunningly beautiful, and the little town is charming. Stop at the Banana Cafe for some cake and coffee. 

**Highlights/Must Dos**

* Nizwa Souq
* Nizwa Fort
* Walk the city walls
* Eat at Cheese Prata for a late night snack

*Note: Jebel Shams/Akhdar are basically ""can't miss"" stops in Oman. I did neither. It didn't make sense for my itinerary and I was willing to give them up because I'm lucky to live in a place where I get that kind of nature x10. You'll want to plan for these while you're around Nizwa over several more days.* 

# Misfat al Abriyyin: 1 Day/Night

A short drive from Nizwa is a lovely village that's mostly great for rooftop cafes and short nature hikes. I could see someone wanting more time here, but I personally was fine with a short stopover. 

Stay in one of the old guest houses, eat a traditional meal on a terrace, and wander through the trails. Bring bug spray here!

**In between Nizwa and Misfat al Abriyyin, you can stop at both Jabreen Castle and Bahla Fort.** Both are amazing sites to walk around in for awhile, and make sense on this route. Otherwise, you can add a Nizwa day as a base to cover these places. 

# Wahiba Sands: 1 Day/Night

Absolute highlight of my trip. There's a few tour operators to choose from, but I highly recommend Starry Domes. You want a place in the dunes, not the lame flat areas nearby a lot of other camps. The operator was the kindest, most knowledgeable person as well, and the food was genuinely fantastic. 

If you rent a 4x4, you can follow your operator into the desert yourself. Otherwise, most offer transfers and meet you in the town of Bidiyah, which is what I did. 

**Ride camels, stargaze, play in the dunes at sunset, wear lots of sunscreen and long, loose clothes, have the time of your fucking life.** 

# Budget, Transportation, and Accommodations

* Oman is not walkable (you might choose between 45 minute detours or Froggering a 6 lane highway).
* Inter/intracity transport is basically nonexistent.
* Everything you want to see is spread out.
* Shoestring accommodations are slim, and poor value for money.

**Renting a car is an absolute must,** and while I usually dislike this, it was a treat in Oman. It simplified a lot,  gave needed respite from the heat, and was pretty magical just driving through the country and soaking it in. Gas is also dirt cheap. 

I'd say make a detailed itinerary first, get your accommodation, excursion, and rental prices, and budget around that after. 

# Basics

**Language:** Arabic, but English is ubiquitous. However, many people truly appreciated a simple ""shukran"" (thank you) after an interaction. It was met with warm smiles, almost like they just appreciated me appreciating them. You don't need basic phrases, but use them!

Almost every sign on the road and in shops were in both languages, you won't have an issue with this.

**Safety:** Absolutely no concern anywhere. Not a woman, so ymmv, but I saw nothing to suggest anything different for women, and I've heard tons of accounts confirming this anecdotally. 

**Dress Code:** Mosques are an exception basically anywhere, but mostly you can dress how you like. As a tattooed guy, I got some looks in shorts and short sleeves, but my attire was *far* from an outlier. 

For maximum respect, you'll do well to cover knees and shoulders, but most places you won't stand out if you're not in a tank and booty shorts. I will say, while I mostly think I struck the right balance, I could tell my attire was offputting and regret not bringing longer, loose fitting clothes specifically for some historical sites and smaller towns. 

At beaches and pools, people are shirtless and in bikinis. You'll notice when you're sticking out, just vibe it. 

**Food:** Omani food has a lot of unique and tasty elements, with a clear influence from India, Pakistan, and especially Yemen. As much as I generally liked it, I found it samey, and it wasn't easy just walking into a random restaurant that would be great. Maybe research some dinners. 

Do try: 

* Lots of dates
* Halwa
* Tons of amazing cakes and desserts with coffee/tea, there's a big culture for it
* Any skewered meat you can get your hands on
* Shuwa
* Called tons of different things, but anything with cheese/meat/veggies in bread like a quesadilla, just fucking munch that shit

**The People:** Advertised as some of the kindest, friendliest, most hospitable in the world, and deservedly so. 

**Alcohol:** If you want to drink, bring in 2 1L bottles you get at Duty Free (for cost purposes, ideally, at the airport you're leaving from). You can't buy packaged alcohol anywhere, and bar options are incredibly expensive and mostly limited to hotel bars. 

**Smoking/Vaping:** Few people partake, but most places had smoking areas. I'm a vaper, and I found a lot of conflicting info both from official sources and on forums about the legality of vapes. I brought my own, I'm genuinely not sure if you're supposed to do that or not but *can* confirm they sell them at Duty Free on the way into Muscat so they're clearly fine to have and use. 

**Opening Hours and Such:** Fridays are their Sundays, so many things close or operate on limited hours. You'll also find the hours between noon-4pm ish many things close until after afternoon prayers. Honestly didn't find out why, but it's common especially for souqs and smaller businesses. 

**Driving:** Be prepared for people to ride your ass if you're going under the speed limit. It's very common for people to move over lanes, or trucks to hug the shoulder to allow passing. They're mostly courteous and consistent, but sometimes they'll still ride your ass if you're just passing, even if you're over the speed limit. 

Lots of cameras everywhere, so don't be reckless. Get used to roundabouts. Don't fucking run red lights, or try to beat the amber signal. 

Annoyingly, it's not legal to mount phones so navigation can be a pain in the ass glancing down at a cupholder. If you're solo, be careful, definitely don't use your phone otherwise (not that you should regardless). 

Google Maps spazzes a bit sometimes, and likes to give repeat directions like ""get on the ramp, take the ramp, take the ramp, stay on the ramp"" before giving you the next direction. Mostly worked fine, didn't like Waze.

1k59bg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1k59bg0/hello_everyone_please_help_me_type_myself/,"Hello everyone, please help me type myself.","I am female, 24 years old (born in 2001), born in December, and my zodiac sign is Sagittarius.

I am currently working as an assistant in the Trade Marketing department. I don’t particularly enjoy my current job because I feel that I’m not suited for working with numbers. I realized this when I observed my manager—she is incredibly sharp with numbers, can immediately spot inconsistencies in data, and can predict market trends based on those figures. Meanwhile, I feel completely clueless. I have no interest in numbers and no curiosity about how they relate to the market.
However, there are certain aspects that make me stay. Most of my current tasks are system-related, and I enjoy understanding the logic behind how systems work and finding ways to optimize time and results.

Regarding my childhood, it was probably similar to most people’s, but from a young age, I was under a lot of pressure regarding grades and peers because of my father’s frequent saying: “If others can do it, you must be able to do it too.” When I got a B, he would be disappointed. This put a lot of pressure on me, making me strive for perfection, always aiming for high scores without any mistakes. So, whenever I scored low, I’d get scared and cry immediately.
This pressure made me anxious and emotionally suppressed because my father would never believe what I said and always wanted me to behave according to what he believed was right. Due to this emotional repression, I would burst into tears if anyone mentioned it.

Psychologically, I think I suffer from severe overthinking. Even a tiny mistake will spiral into a huge worry for me, making me feel like it will negatively affect not only myself but also those around me. When this happens, I just want to escape from reality to avoid facing it. I hate bothering others and prefer doing everything by myself. I’m not used to asking for help or borrowing things, so I always carry a lot with me, thinking, “If I don’t need it, maybe someone else will.” As a result, my bag is always heavy, and people often come to me to borrow things—which I don’t mind.
I also can’t socialize the way others around me do. If I feel uncomfortable, my expression shows it immediately, which might make people think I’m impulsive. But I can’t hide my feelings. I constantly seek recognition, but I don’t brag about what I know or can do because I don’t want others to have high expectations and end up disappointed.
I always want to be the first person mentioned in a subject or field, but I’ve never felt truly satisfied about it, as I always seem to be the second or third choice in people’s minds. I’m easily emotionally triggered, and it’s hard to control my emotions, which makes people think I’m overly sensitive and cry too easily. I often feel insecure, fearing that my knowledge isn’t enough and worrying about how I’ll be perceived when I share it.

If I have to spend the weekend alone, I might feel a bit bored since my family usually gathers at my house on Sundays. Without them, something feels missing. However, I still feel more comfortable being at home alone than going out. It gives me a proper weekend where I can do everything on my own schedule, without having to follow others’ expectations.

I don’t like sports much, and I dislike going out. If I do go out, it’s usually riding around the city with my boyfriend or hanging out with close friends at our usual coffee spot. Whenever I go out, I constantly worry, “Is this okay?” “Is my outfit acceptable?”—these questions always linger in my head because I care about how others perceive me.
When it comes to travel, I enjoy it—but only if I’m the one planning the trip. I like to prepare thoroughly and spend a lot of time at one place to fully experience its atmosphere and surroundings.

My curiosity depends on how much I care about the topic. If I’m not interested, I can completely ignore it and not follow any updates. But if I do care, I’ll spend hours researching until I’ve gathered enough information.
I have a lot of ideas for myself but also a lot of fears and worries before I start. Things like, “Can I do it well?” “What if I fail?” “What will people think of me?”… I’m often curious about psychology, why people think differently, why they act a certain way in specific situations, and topics like MBTI, cognitive functions, Enneagram—as tools to understand myself better.
My ideas usually revolve around these areas, and I often wonder if learning a new skill would suit me and whether I could do well in it.

Back in school, I was often chosen to be the leader or class monitor because people saw me as responsible and observant. At that time, I didn’t feel entirely suited for the role, but I accepted it because I liked being able to organize things my way.
My leadership style leans toward listening and observing the team, assigning tasks I know they can do well, while I focus on the groundwork and overseeing everything. That said, I tend to prefer being in the background cheering people on rather than leading from the front.
That’s probably my weakness as a leader. But I never let anyone affect my team or its members; when needed, I’ll be the first to stand up and protect them. I want to bring the best for my team, not just for my own benefit, but for everyone’s.
I’m a perfectionist, so I expect team members to complete their tasks to my satisfaction. If they can’t or won’t, I’ll take it on myself.

I don’t think I have much artistic talent, but I value art and always want to appreciate it deeply. That’s why I studied music theory, learned to play the ukulele, explored color theory in painting, and learned a bit about music in general.
I love art, especially music and painting, because I’m easily drawn to sounds and colors. Most of my notebooks are color-coded and carefully decorated, each color having a purpose.
Music is how I relax—I immerse myself in it completely. I care more about how a song is composed than its popularity, since many famous songs are just trendy but structurally unremarkable. So, my taste in music may differ from others’.

I’m a very nostalgic person. I often think about the past and can still vividly feel the familiarity when talking about it. In the present, I try my best to live well and complete my work. I don’t follow a strict to-do list; I keep things in my head and act accordingly. I constantly learn to improve myself and gain more knowledge about what truly interests me.
As for the future, I often come up with many scenarios but never feel completely certain—because who knows what tomorrow brings? So I focus on living well in the present and becoming a better version of myself.
I keep growing, but I’m also always grateful for my past because without it, I wouldn’t be who I am today.

Whether I help someone or not depends on how I perceive their need and whether I’m capable of helping them as they expect. But in most cases, I won’t say no.
I’m always enthusiastic toward people, and some say that’s my weakness. But if I don’t help, I’ll feel guilty and blame myself. I’m especially scared of homeless people—especially children and the elderly—because I often can’t help them, which makes me feel very guilty and deeply disturbed.

I’m not a very logical person, but maybe due to my father’s influence, I always want things around me to follow a flow that I’ve determined to be right and effective.
Efficiency and productivity are very important to me. If I’ve decided to start something, it means I’ve agreed to spend my time on it—so my time and effort must be used wisely and produce meaningful results.

I usually don’t care how others do things, but for those I care about—especially my boyfriend—I want him to act and do things in the order and way I think is most effective. If he doesn’t, I’ll get irritated and lash out at him.

My hobby is makeup. I enjoy the meticulousness it requires and the way it combines skin, color, technique, and tools to create a satisfying look. It boosts my confidence.

My learning style emphasizes logic. I can remember and apply something best when I understand it thoroughly and can logically connect it to real-life contexts or prior knowledge.
The most challenging learning environment for me is one that’s too crowded, as it distracts and overwhelms me.
In class, I tend to sit in the front to stay focused and engage with the lecturer. I enjoy studying in cafes, but only quiet, low-key ones.
I love note-taking and color-code everything according to my own system. My notebooks are detailed and logical, and many teachers appreciated them.
I enjoy language, art, and music classes because I can fully focus and feel passionate about them.

I’m not very confident in my strategic planning skills. My strategies usually focus on bringing benefits to both myself and the people around me. I observe and understand people’s strengths and weaknesses, then assign tasks I’m sure they can do well, aiming for a cohesive, expected outcome. I’m good at breaking down projects into manageable tasks and always prepare for unexpected situations. I can adapt when needed.

To me, finding something that meets two criteria—something I love and something I can understand deeply—is crucial. I’ve always struggled with not knowing what I love or excel at, so I constantly seek it to grow in the most suitable direction.

My wish is to remain who I am now—someone who is always aware of and working toward becoming a better version of myself.

I have many fears—fear of not being recognized, of negativity, of losing something, of being misunderstood…
I don’t feel comfortable in corporate environments because of the number of people. I always have to keep a good attitude and engage in small talk, even though I constantly feel like they’re judging me, even if they’re not.
I hate feeling left out because it makes me feel like I’m always the last one and unimportant.

To me, “highs” mean waking up each day without feeling like life is hell—whether that’s from living in a family I’m not comfortable with or doing a job I don’t enjoy but have to do to survive.
An ideal life is one where I can do what I want, buy what I like, and feel at peace.

On the other hand, “lows” are the opposite of that.

I’m quite realistic. I can look at reality and make decisions, even if they’re blunt. But sometimes, I daydream—I get lost in my thoughts and theories and tune out everything around me.

If I found myself in an empty, silent void with no one around, I’d be extremely panicked and pray that it was just a dream.

I tend to make impulsive decisions like “I want it, I got it,” and usually don’t overthink. If something makes me hesitate for over a day, then it’s not that important and I’ll put it aside.
I’ve never regretted my decisions—right or wrong, they’ve led me to where I am now, still striving for the life I want and to become better.

I often can’t control my emotions, so I express them openly. I deeply value emotions—mine and others’. I believe everyone is a unique individual, but I also can’t help but wonder why people feel the way they do and whether I can empathize with them.

I’m the kind of person who easily nods in agreement during conversations, just to let people know I’m listening and trying to empathize with their story. I don’t want to interrupt because I value that they chose to share it with me.

I tend to compromise with myself. I don’t want to push myself too hard, so I often can’t follow certain personal rules. But in a group setting, I always follow rules because I don’t want to cause trouble or inconvenience others.

To me, an ideal life is one where I feel truly comfortable and can immerse myself in all the beautiful things it has to offer.

Is it okay if I buy it myself and use it, how often can I use?","Unfortunately I'm struggling with discoloration. Ive had a lot of professional cleanings, shortly after that the discoloration appears again. Ive done some homework and realized it's my bad habits most likely. Like brushing teeth after drinking energy or coffee and drinking lemon with water without a straw for years. Also gargling salt water for like half an hour instead of just 30 seconds. I thought my habits were good, but I've realized it's the opposite. I'm afraid I've severely damaged my enamel, caused erosion, dry mouth. Im changing my habits; have a good electric brush, use paste for sensitive teeth, scrape my tong, floss.  

My hygienist gave me this to use when the discoloration appears again. 
- how do I use it? First thing in the morning use the paste with an electric brush? For how long should it sit on my teeth? Rinse after with water? Or use it after I've brushed my teeth - so my teeth are clean when I apply the paste? 
- I think I've found it on the internet. Is it okay for me to buy this and use? How often can I use this? 
My dentists are useless. Just for the money and don't take my concerns serious. It's crazy how little the average person knows about teeth care and how little dentists inform their patients. ",1,1745336113.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1k599lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/1k599lq/alex_abi_20/,Alex Abi 2.0,"Alright, let’s begin with a massive thank you to everyone on Reddit, Twitter, and Discord who flagged this for me. You guys are like the canaries in the coal mine. I didn’t want to see it. I didn’t mean to see it. But once I did, it was like putting on the glasses in They Live. I can’t unsee it.

So here it is:

Hasan Piker is, quite literally and figuratively, the modern incarnation of Alex Jones.

Now, before you go full DEFCON 1 in the replies, allow me to clarify; this is not to say they are ideologically aligned. Not even remotely. One screams about demons and frogs; the other screams about imperialism and billionaires. But stylistically, structurally, rhetorically? They are twin flames separated by a decade, a few million dollars in fashion sense, and a fundamental disagreement on whether climate change is real.

The comparisons are too many, too specific, and too revealing to ignore. So buckle in.


1. Charisma as Catastrophe

Both men are performative hurricanes. They enter a room or more accurately, a stream with the urgency of someone who just discovered the world is ending. They don’t speak. They broadcast. They don’t comment. They declare. Every sentence is delivered with such apocalyptic fervor that even ordering a sandwich would sound like a warning about martial law.


2. Anti-Establishment to the Bone

Alex Jones sees black helicopters. Hasan sees neoliberal hegemonic structures. The vocabulary changes, but the narrative is the same: The system is not only broken, it was built to break you. They both weaponize institutional mistrust and present themselves as the antidote.


3. Studio Theater

Let’s talk production. Jones has the dark desk, the dramatic angle, and graphics that look like rejected Metal Gear Solid cutscenes. Hasan has the three-camera Twitch setup with clean lighting and ironic memes. It’s the same architecture: command center of the resistance. Different aesthetics, identical purpose.


4. Conspiratorial Curiosity Dressed as “Independent Thought”

Alex says, “The elite are lizards in human skin.” Hasan says, “The CIA’s long-term psyops have shifted the Overton window to accept mass exploitation under the guise of social progress.” One is cartoonishly absurd. The other is packaged in grad-school vocabulary. But both are ultimately seductive alt-narratives.


5. Fear of the Mainstream

Jones believes CNN is globalist propaganda. Hasan believes MSNBC is neoliberal white noise. Both reject traditional media as compromised. Both claim their channels are the last real sources of unfiltered truth. Neither has seen a mainstream media segment they didn’t want to pause, ridicule, and reframe in real time.


6. Parasocial Armies

The audiences. Oh, the audiences. Jones commands a militia of boomers who think Bill Gates is microchipping their toothpaste. Hasan has an army of 20-somethings who treat every chat message like it’s part of the dialectic. Both would charge into rhetorical war for their guy. And both live off the emotional high of being adored and misunderstood.


7. Doomsday Monologues

There’s a cadence to it. A rhythm. You’ve heard it. It starts with something mild like a news article and within 90 seconds, they’re both on a tear, drawing historical parallels, invoking empires, and warning that “this is only the beginning.” Every day is Judgment Day. Every moment is the edge of collapse.


8. The 4-Hour Stream as Sacred Rite

Both men treat time like an illusion. Streams go for hours. They do not pause. They do not reset. They move from one existential threat to the next like they are flipping channels in hell. If you spend enough time watching, you start to lose track of what’s real and what’s commentary.


9. Critics as Covert Agents

Jones sees deep-state operatives everywhere. Hasan has labeled more people as ""glowies"" than I can count. They both assume that disagreement is not just ideological; it is orchestrated sabotage. Dissent is treated not as engagement, but infiltration.


10. Theatrical Disgust

The headphone removal. The leaning back in the chair. The squint. The “I can’t believe what I’m seeing right now” look. Both have mastered the pantomime of disbelief. They don’t just tell you that something is outrageous; they embody outrage.


Let’s speed this up and hit the next 40, rapid-fire, because yes; there are that many:


11. They rely heavily on visual aids, all of which look like they were made by a conspiracy-addled grad student.



12. They break news like it’s a sermon.



13. Both have been accused of radicalizing their audiences.



14. They don’t debate; they try to dominate.



15. There’s always a “bigger picture” that conveniently never resolves.



16. They’re both one crisis away from launching a supplement line.



17. The voice gets raspier the more serious they get.



18. They accuse others of brainwashing, while live-streaming daily.



19. Neither can resist a spicy out-of-context clip.



20. Every opponent is either a puppet or a coward.



21. Irony is a shield they both wield and discard when convenient.



22. Their streams have lore. Actual narrative lore.



23. “They don’t want you to know this…” is a frequent opener.



24. Both paint themselves as misunderstood heroes.



25. Platform bans are framed as martyrdom.



26. They always knew it was coming.



27. They both “call it” before it happens (even when they didn’t).



28. They claim to hate drama but lean into it constantly.



29. Everything is a psyop.



30. Every moment is historic.





31. Long, dramatic pauses for effect.



32. Anger that spikes, then resets instantly.



33. Vocabulary that switches between hyper-intellectual and primal rage.



34. They turn policy discussions into Shakespearean monologues.



35. They're both weirdly obsessed with masculinity, while pretending not to be.



36. Their haters are part of the narrative arc.



37. Meme culture is baked into their messaging.



38. They both believe information is warfare.



39. Neither can go more than ten minutes without invoking the word “they.”



40. Both claim to be standing up for “the people” without clearly defining who “the people” are.



41. Frenetic, improvisational delivery.



42. Tension between authenticity and performance.



43. Comfortably wealthy, but performatively working-class.



44. They each think they are the final boss of political commentary.



45. Both attract enemies because they cultivate them.



46. The narrative always circles back to how “they” don’t want you thinking critically.



47. Cults of personality that are entirely self-aware.



48. Rhetorical questions with no intention of letting you answer.



49. Broadcasts structured like political exorcisms.



50. An almost spiritual belief in their own righteousness.


And, of course, 51. The Apocalypse Stream Hypothesis

If civilization collapsed tomorrow, if the grid went dark, if society fractured into warring tribes; both of these men would still be broadcasting. Jones would be in a bunker. Hasan would be streaming via satellite from an undisclosed safe house, sipping iced coffee and breaking down the post-collapse economy with the same conviction as ever.


So, yeah. HasanAbi is Alex Jones 2.0. Not in ideology. Not in message. But in method. In presentation. In spectacle. This is what the new age of political commentary looks like. It’s not clean. It’s not rational. It’s a genre. And both of them are masters of it.

Again, thank you to everyone who helped me see the pattern. I did not want this knowledge. But now I bear it. And I share it with you, so that you too may understand the age of content prophets we now live in.

Now to the problem, but I have to go into a little more detail as I think it is relevant to the diagnosis.

(This post ist translated from German into English)



Almost eleven years ago, half a year after graduating from high school, when I was applying for universities and leading a relatively unhealthy life (with lots of coffee, little sleep, lots of partying, working late into the night, etc.), I suddenly had severe flashbacks out of nowhere with images from my childhood of bullying, my mother's cruelty towards me, bad experiences, etc., which ultimately resulted in severe panic attacks with extreme trembling, inner nervousness and a strong feeling of anxiety in my chest, which were absolutely unbearable and even strong sedatives like Tavor had no effect. These panic attacks and extreme anxiety lasted for weeks and months without ever subsiding. I was completely desperate, nothing could calm my body down. At some point, a terrible obsessive thought came along. But it wasn't a typical obsessive thought with obscene content or anything like that. No, it was more like a thought without content, but one that I always had to remember. Every second of my existence. I thought about what exactly it was for a long time, but never figured it out. It was a combination of a fearful thought and a feeling. It was like an endless loop in my brain that poured out a lot of fear. At some point I hallucinated faintly, i.e. I saw colorful reflections of light on the white wall, as well as walls coming closer and felt unreal while walking. I couldn't eat any more, became severely underweight in a short time and was completely beside myself. But what bothered me most was this obsessive thought, as it was really there every second and I was absolutely unable to free myself from it or distract myself from it. The end of the story was that I was then admitted to a district hospital and spent three quarters of a year there with no prospect of recovery. I really thought I was going to die, it was the worst time of my life so far. I had no strength left, I was just trapped in my head. I woke up with panic attacks and went to bed with panic attacks. The doctors there diagnosed me with all sorts of illnesses, which they eventually reversed. Everything from generalized anxiety disorder to psychosis was included. However, they were never able to make an exact diagnosis. The medication was also changed on a weekly basis. Starting with Zyprexa, then Seroquel, then various antidepressants and so on. Nothing helped. Some made me more tired than others, others made my eyes flicker and I saw flashes of light. In the end, none of them helped. Sometime in March 2015, after three quarters of a year in hospital, my condition slowly improved and I was discharged from hospital. The obsessive thoughts continued to haunt me for longer and restlessness kept coming through here and there. I finally overcame the obsessive thoughts by taking driving lessons. I signed up for a driving license and was able to gradually let the obsessive thoughts fade into the background by paying extreme attention to the traffic. Initially only for a few seconds, then eventually for minutes and finally hours and days. Within a few months, I had my old life back. I was once again a happy young woman with a great zest for life and lived my life as if nothing had ever happened. 

I had a wonderful life for almost eleven years, never truly forgot that time of horror, but was completely normal and always said that beating this disease was the greatest thing I had ever done. What always accompanied me, however, was a certain fear of illness. Health anxiety or a mild hypochondria I would say.

I used to get myself into illnesses when my body showed strange symptoms that I couldn't interpret. But I always managed to get out of it in time before it got worse. Mostly because a doctor reassured me that I was healthy.

I had built a great life for myself in those ten years. I married my boyfriend of many years, we bought a great old house, have a loving dog and I've felt very much at home in my new city for the last two years.

I thought I had achieved everything. Only a child would have completed our happiness. 

Then last year in March I became pregnant. We were so happy and my pregnancy seemed like something out of a picture book. I hardly had any nausea or hair loss. I was spared anything negative. At least I thought so. Visits to the gynaecologist were always nice and I looked forward to every visit. In the middle of my pregnancy, however, my high blood pressure became more and more apparent. However, it was in a range that didn't seem alarming to the gynecologist. The values were in the range of 140:95, sometimes more, sometimes less. I had never had high blood pressure before, so I was a little worried about the possibility of pre-eclampsia. But the doctor never detected any protein in my urine, so I thought I was on the safe side until the end. I had loud ringing in my ears twice, but basically I was mentally and physically fine until the end and I just put it down to the pregnancy. Two days before my due date, I went into labor at night and called my midwife the next morning to see if she could come by. She came in the morning but found that my cervix was not even a centimeter open and asked me to lie down on the couch to have acupuncture needles inserted. I was supposed to relax, but I never did. As soon as I was lying on my back, the midwife pulled out her blood pressure monitor and put it around my arm. The result: 160:110 blood pressure. She said she didn't want to worry me now, but I should go to the hospital immediately as she was sure I had pre-eclampsia. I couldn't believe what she was saying. I had expected to give birth at any time without any problems. Out of nowhere I had the worst panic attack of my life. My eyes just flickered and I was unable to move. I only just managed to remove the needles from my legs and call my husband. I couldn't even get my hospital bag and was unable to walk up the stairs. All I remember was getting into the car and telling my husband that I thought I was having a stroke. There at the hospital, a urine test confirmed the sad truth. I had severe pre-eclampsia with lots of protein and my kidneys were slowly becoming permeable. I found myself bitterly crying and signing the induction form, thinking my life was over and I was going to die. The first night in hospital was terrible, no sleep at all, I suffered from severe headaches and had a totally swollen face with red patches under my eyes and around my nose. The induction was a disaster, it was the worst pain I ever felt. I lasted one day. My waters broke, I was leaking for hours, I was under extreme stress, but my cervix did not open.  At some point I begged the doctor to give me a caesarean section. I just couldn't take any more. She wasn't enthusiastic about my suggestion until the very end, when the next shock finally came. The baby had the umbilical cord around its neck, which caused the heartbeat to drop. I was panicking again. I was so scared of the little one and of getting an injection in my back. It was then quickly decided to do an emergency C-section to save the baby, so the doctors and the anesthetist ran off during their lunch break and prepared me for the operation. I still remember how they put these stockings on me and how I got the injection in my back, full of fear. It was a spinal anesthetic, not an epidural. I remember that the doctor pricked my back several times. Maybe that will be important later. During the operation I was strangely very relaxed and stared at the ceiling while the baby was taken out and jiggled around in my stomach. My husband was present and said that the machine showed a systolic blood pressure of over 200 and was always clicked away by the nurse as an emergency signal. However, I didn't notice any of this. When the little one was brought in for us to see, I was totally happy and exhausted and cried full of joy. I was then taken to the separate room and waited until my legs regained feeling. The first day with the little one was good as far as I can remember. And my blood pressure was  briefly back to 134:80 or something like that. I really thought everything was fine now. However, the worst came later. One day later to be precise. I suddenly had an extreme headache the next day. It hurt endlessly in my neck, forehead and sides and nothing helped. No painkillers, nothing. I had the catheter in from the caesarean section and had an additional load of painkillers as an infusion in my veins. I think there were two different medications. One of them was paracetamol, no idea about the other one. When I tried to sleep, I saw a blue aura with my eyes closed. Like looking through a kaleidoscope. Like being on an acid trip. At first I put it down to being overtired and exhausted. However, my condition got worse and worse. The headaches lasted for four days, I didn't get any sleep because the nurses kept waking me up every two hours to breastfeed the little one. On the second day after the birth, my blood pressure was measured and it was suddenly 180:110. I had a terrible panic attack. I thought it was really over for me now. My blood pressure didn't go down for the next few days either, it got higher and higher and my anxiety got worse and worse. By now I was panicking in front of the blood pressure monitor and I kept asking the nurses and doctors whether I was going to die from it, whether my readings were getting worse, etc.  I could no longer calm down, something was terribly wrong with me. I constantly had a strange feeling in my head. Totally foggy and restless. When I fell asleep, I kept seeing images in front of my eyes and I kept tossing and turning, like a microsleep, without really sleeping. I only became aware of it when my phone suddenly fell out of my hand out of nowhere and I was startled awake. I kept seeing these strange images. I had never experienced anything like it and I was incredibly scared. On the fourth day, the whole right side of my face started to hurt. It was really a dull pain around my right eye. Everything was just so tight. My jaw hurt, as did my cheekbone and, to make matters worse, my vision was suddenly completely blurred in my right eye. I was not able to focus anymore and absolutely panicked to the point where the doctors didn't know what was happening to me. My thoughts were racing around blood pressure, pre-eclampsia and death. I just instinctively knew something was wrong with me and begged the doctors to examine me as I could no longer see clearly. They then ordered an MRI and I was taken there in a wheelchair because I could no longer walk properly and suddenly had severe dizziness. Not dizziness where my surroundings were spinning, but I felt as if I was swaying, as if the ground was no longer stable and as if I had absorbent cotton in my head. It was frightening. In the evening I was lying in bed and I went so crazy that I saw the clock and the Jesus cross on the wall jump. I saw everything double and move. I had the feeling that my brain was pulsating, i.e. expanding and contracting. The nurse put a blood pressure machine on my arm and I suddenly saw afterimages of her arm movements. As if the image was still there afterwards. I begged the doctors to take me to the intensive care unit because I really thought I was going to die. That really was the worst moment of me in this hospital. My blood pressure slowly went down over the next few days and was then brought down to 145:90 with Nifetipine at the end. Still far too high, but the nurses tried to reassure me that I wouldn't die of post partum pre-eclampsia now. The vision in my right eye improved again, but it didn't feel the same as before. I was finally discharged 11 days after the birth with Sertraline and Nifetipine as antihypertensives, but my life has not been the same since. Now to my problem. It's now been over four months since the birth and I've had that unbearable anxiety and panic every day since then. The racing thoughts about blood pressure and pre-eclampsia have now turned back into these second-by-second obsessive thoughts/feelings with no content. It's just like it was 11 years ago and I have absolutely no idea how to stop it. But now to the much worse problem. I have had this strange dizziness since giving birth. It's not dizziness where my surroundings are spinning, but I sway all the time, as if I have no feeling in my legs/feet. I am dazed 24/7, have difficulty focusing my eyes, often have a pressure in my head, often between my eyebrows, then sometimes on my scalp, as if my brain is hurting. I can no longer remember anything, have difficulty doing the simplest things. It's as if my brain can no longer keep up. Before all that I was always so active and able to multitask, now I'm happy when I can make my little one a bottle. It's like my brain is only running at 2%. I also have extreme insomnia and often have these images in front of my eyes. It's terrible. Like a nightmare that I can't wake up from. When I go into stores or buildings it's extreme. The drowsiness and the swaying are so terrible. I can no longer follow normal conversations, all I think about is this condition, how I can get rid of it, what it could be, etc. I am so desperate and now depressed. I used to love life so much and was such a fun-loving, open and social person. Now I can't take it anymore and am just googling symptoms and can't get out of my anxiety and this dizziness. I came across PPPD on the internet and wondered if this could be it. The symptoms are identical to mine. Especially the fact that it gets worse when the environment changes. I can no longer understand the simplest things that require motoric action, such as unfolding the baby carriage, or I can't keep up with the most normal conversations. It feels like I've had a stroke. However, all tests are fine. I have already had two MRIs, blood tests, an EEG and a dizziness test at the ENT doctor. Everything came back with no detectable structural damage. I can't go on living like this, and I want this condition to be gone so much. I want to be there for my child, but even that overwhelms me. The illness and the dizziness take over me 100%. Could this be due to the spinal anesthesia? I have already called an anesthesiologist and told him about my situation. However, he said that other complaints (such as paralysis) would occur with such complications and that he assumed that I had a purely psychological problem in the form of psychosis. However, I have now been in a psychosomatic clinic for 8 weeks and psychosis was ruled out there. I had the panic attacks under control quite well at that time, but the dizziness/drowsiness was extreme and always there. Sometimes I couldn't even pour myself a cup of tea or put a tray in the stand.  As soon as I stand up and walk, the dizziness is extreme and I have to concentrate so much. I don't have this dizziness when I'm in the car or lying down. But it's there as soon as I start walking. If I stop after a long walk, it feels like I'm riding in an elevator. Walking itself feels like getting off a ride. Running is impossible, as soon as I run, I feel like my brain is jumping and bouncing and my eyes start to flicker. I just can't do it anymore. What could it be? Do any of you have experience of this? I don't want to live like this anymore. What could have happened? Has my brain been poisoned with these infusions? Please can someone tell me that this will go away? Thank you in advance. 



Here are all my symptoms again:



Dizziness/ light-headedness/feeling dizzy all the time

Strange numb feeling in shins

Strange feeling in feet

Stiff feeling/ extreme pressure in forehead

Can't eat any more 

When I look at my phone or laptop, I later see the text lines everywhere

Compulsive brooding every second 

Extreme dry mouth 

No energy but restlessness

1k592qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1k592qg/29m_struggling_with_dating_despite_having/,29M - Struggling with dating despite having everything else going for me,"I’m a 29-year-old guy living in Toronto, working as an engineer. I’m 6’2”, very athletic, social, and have a solid group of friends. I genuinely enjoy meeting new people and don’t struggle with social situations in general.

But when it comes to dating, I’ve been hitting a granite wall—and it’s been really frustrating. In the two years since I moved here, the only women who’ve shown some interest in me have been:

* A 25-year-old from Tinder, the only match I've had since downloading the app, who turned out to be into hallucinogenic drugs and weed and clearly not in a healthy place physically or mentally. I'm happy to date her if she wasn't into that stuff; but it does not match who I am.
* A 33-year-old who had just left an 8-year marriage a month ago and was clearly very emotionally vulnerable—it is very clear to me based on what she said that she is very lonely and struggling with being new to the city and not ready to date at all. Happy to be her friend, but I will not be a rebound relationship.
* A 26-year-old I gave a chance to, who then casually told me she had just gotten out of a mental institution, without explaining further. I'm sorry but I have people in my family who have a psychological illness and as much as I want to be a nice guy; there's no way I'm bringing that into my already stressful life.

I’ve been trying to stay patient and open-minded, but honestly, it’s been wearing me down. I don’t feel desirable or respected. I just want to know what it’s like to ask someone out for a coffee or dinner and get a genuine “yes” from someone I find appealing and worthwhile. I don't care that much about attractiveness. I just want someone who's similar to me in mental resilience, fitness, hygiene and self-care.

If this is the pattern of who I’m attracting—women who are only showing interest because they’re in crisis—then it makes me question if I’m even interested in dating at all. It’s making me feel like I’d rather live alone in the woods than keep going through this.

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of situation? Is it just bad luck, or am I giving off something I’m not aware of?",3,1745335548.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

A couple years later I started eating much healthier and taking better care of my body, no longer a teenager. Now I seem to get migraines or headaches regularly? 

All the things that people say trigger headaches and migraines seem to help me... I'm so confused.

Caffiene is a trigger... and yet, for me, if I drink a strong coffee it will sometimes stop a migraine from forming completely. [I do not drink coffee regularly, so it's not satisfying a withdrawal issue]. 

If I eat a salad with tomatoes in but no dairy i will get a migraine. Why on earth is this so specific? No other nightshade family fruit or veg do this to me, and it's fine if I have dairy with them, and tomatoes outside of a salad don't affect me like this, and salads without tomatoes are fine. What the fuck?

And most of all, one of the biggest things to help stop them is fast food. I eat FF maybe once a week? The rest of the time I'm pretty healthy. But if I have a headache, about 10 mins after eating fast food it seems to decrease. Google just says I'm being dramatic and it's a placebo effect, but I'm not the only one with this experience. I thought it might be salt content, so I have tried eating salty things, or that with some water, with a headache and it's made no difference.

I can't drink coffee past midday or I won't sleep, and I can't keep ruining my diet every time I get a headache by ordering take out. I can't seem to work out the triggers either other than the overly specific salad issue. 

It's driving me insane, does anyone have any advice or wisdom they can impart?  ",3,1745335466.0,migraine,9,1.0,False

She’s a nurse working long shifts, and lately we’ve only seen each other briefly—usually when I drop off food or coffee during her workdays. Today, we were supposed to hang out after her shift, and I was really looking forward to it.

This morning, she called and asked if I had anything going on. I let her know I had a project presentation at noon but would be free the rest of the day. She immediately got upset. I tried to explain I still had the rest of the day open for her, but she snapped back with, “You don’t understand—you’ve never worked a 12-hour shift as a nurse.”

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. I’ve always tried to be supportive, but it’s tough. I worked physically demanding jobs through college and never took that frustration out on her or canceled plans because of it. Still, she told me she didn’t want to see me anymore today.

I’m just feeling lost. I want to be there for her, but I also don’t feel like I did anything wrong. How can I navigate this better?

Central Perk isn’t just a coffee shop, it’s kind of the anchor of the entire group. It’s where they meet daily, where deep convos happen, where breakups and reunions play out.

Made me wonder

if Central Perk didn’t exist, would this friend group have stayed as tight-knit as they were? Would Chandler and Joey have ended up hanging with a different crowd? Would Rachel and Monica have reconnected at all?

In real life, so many friendships fade when there isn’t a shared space bringing people together consistently. Do you think that would’ve happened here?

Curious what everyone thinks, was Central Perk the seventh friend?

So the case is an interesting concept, someone has stolen Phoenix's identity and did a poor job as a defense attorney and lost the case so now we have to do a retrial and get this client who was already found guilty found innocent again. The client is Maggey Byrde again which is nice to see her return but this time as a waitress and the imposter, well he's a loud angry red gangster looking guy who screamed so long that his scream needed multiple textboxes. So this case is fun.

The characters introduced in this case are something. We have Jean Armstrong, the effeminate but muscular French chef who runs the restaurant where the murder happened and he even stole the magatama during the investigation, he is very weird and his design is off putting. And then there is Victor Kudo, a grump old man who is ashamed that he likes going to the restaurant just to see the waitresses in there uniforms. I like how to get him talking, Maya who has already gotten a job as a waitresses channels Mia just so Victor can see a hot lady in a waitress outfit so he will talk to us.

And the first trial segment was something, I honestly laughed alot while cross examining Victor, his testimony was so awful and easy to spot the contradictions. I liked pointing out that the victim couldn't have held the coffee cup with his left hand because of where the lip stain was on the cup, I liked pointing out that Victor didn't actually see if Maggey was the waitress that poisoned the victims cup because he was to busy looking at her uniform, I liked pointing out that the victim couldn't have been wearing the earpiece in his left ear because he had a ruptured left ear drum and finally one of the easiest contradictions ever, Victor says the victim knocked over a vase when he died but one look at the photo crime scene proves that did not happened. In the end, I don't think Victor's testimony was useful. It does become useful later though if I remember.

""Good morning, Tim,"" the doctor said, closing the door behind him. ""I heard the procedure went well.""

""That's what they told me.""

""Good!"" The doctor smiled. ""Let's hope those seizures are under control."" He sat down, picked a few items out of the basket and placed them in his lap, out of Tim's view.

""Now, as we've discussed, there may be some peculiar new mental functioning,"" the doctor explained. ""We're going to test that this morning. Are you ready?""

 Tim nodded. The doctor picked out an item and put it in the middle of the table.

""Ok, Tim. What object do you see there?""

""A baseball,"" Tim answered correctly.

""Perfect,"" the doctor replied. Then he pulled out an eye patch and handed it across the table. ""Now, cover your right eye, please.""

Tim complied. He could now see only out of his left eye. The doctor put the baseball away and set out another object.

""Now what do you see?""



\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



""New request from auditory,"" R's boss said, poking his head into the visual processing lounge. ""Simple one. They want to know what the object on the table is called.""

R looked at the screen behind him. ""That coffee mug?"" he asked. 

""Yep,"" his boss replied. ""Just get that info across the bridge over to Speech and Language. They'll take it from there.""

""Easy enough,"" said R as he rose from his seat. He walked over to the printer, pushed a few buttons and in nanoseconds had an image of the object on a piece of neural paper.

""Wait, why can't L just handle this one?"" R asked. ""He's like, right there.""

""They covered his side up,"" the boss replied. ""He can't see what it is.""

""What? Why?""

""It's some weird experiment,"" his boss explained, shrugging. ""They must be doing some kind of systems check after that crazy storm we had last night.""

""Huh,"" R responded. ""Well, I'll head over there now, then. Back in two picoseconds.""

His boss nodded. ""Take your time. They're not rushing us.""

R headed out of his office, neural paper in hand. In his company Axon he could reach the bridge to L-Land in about 5 milliseconds. 3 if he was in a hurry.

He wasn't, though, so he set Axon's cruise control to 5 millimeters per microsecond and headed out. He flipped on his Synapse receiver and tuned it to a news station. They were talking about the storm.

""...had electric storms before, obviously. They're common, and they've been getting worse, but I never thought we'd see anything like that.""

""Do you think this was targeted? A deliberate attack on sovereign Tim's brain?"" the host asked.

""That's fear-mongering,"" a pundit replied. ""We see storms like that all the time. Who would be targeting him, and why?""

""It's just a crazy coincidence that this happened in a Limbic election year,"" the host snapped back.

""Now that's just ridiculous..."" the pundit replied. R rolled his eyes and switched stations. 

""...no damage reported to any part of R-Land, but communication with L-Land has seemingly been cut off,"" a stern voice said, and caught R's attention.

""Cut off? How? What does that mean?"" a second voice asked.

""It means just that, cut off. We haven't had any communication from L-Land since the event,"" the stern voice replied. ""We're not sure if there's been any damage over there, or frankly, if L-Land even exists at all anymore.""

""What?"" the second voice asked, chuckling. ""It might be completely gone?""

""As far as we know.""

""If you're just joining us,"" the second voice cut in, ""we're here with the Communications Director of R-Land's Cerebral Hemisphere, and from the sounds of it the event was much more than a standard electrical storm.""

""Correct,"" the stern voice cut in. ""It's been confirmed that this was not at all epileptic in nature. In fact, we have reason to believe there may have been outside interference.""

""Outside? As...how? An accident?""

""There is evidence that...""

""*Yikes*,"" R thought, his mind drifting. ""*This really wasn't just another storm, was it?*""

He thought about the previous night; tried to remember anything he could.

There had been an electrical storm, he remembered, although it was worse than usual. It knocked out power to the entire visual processing grid, and probably most of the rest of Tim's normal functioning brain, for several minutes. R had heard rumors of extreme methods of treatment for Tim, including lobotomies and electric shock therapy, but the storms were beginning to affect the part of Tim's brain that held and processed memories so data about what Tim had learned and experienced in the past few months was spotty at best.

After the storm, R remembered delivering images and names of medical devices across the bridge. ""Defibulator...defrimbillator? Whatever, close enough,"" he remembered thinking. The last image he processed was of a long tube attached to a bag of fluid and bright, white lights in the ceiling.

Then Tim's brain shut down.

When visual processing was awoken, the entire hemisphere was buzzing about news that neurons from the unconscious had been spreading. Something big had happened while Tim was out. The unconscious was typically dramatic and unreliable, though, so most of Tim's conscious mind just assumed it was another storm.

""...might actually have been surgery,"" a voice on the receiver said.

Suddenly, R had to slam on his brakes. There was a traffic jam several micrometers long in front of him, dead stopped. He turned his receiver off and got out of his car. Millions of other neurons had done the same.

""Hey, dude,"" one of them said, appearing next to him. ""Bridge is out.""

""What?""

""The bridge. The storm, or whatever. It took it out. It's completely gone,"" the neuron said.

""That...that's impossible."" R stammered. ""Look, I have to get this to Speech and Language.""

""Join the club,"" the neuron replied. ""We all have business over there.""

""But...there's just no way. How are we...how is Tim...going to function?"" R asked.

""See for yourself, if you don't believe me,"" the neuron said, gesturing to a lump of gray matter packed with thousands of neurons gazing in the direction of the bridge.

R joined the crowd of neurons making their way up the lump. A little over half way up, he looked and saw a giant, empty chasm where the bridge, the only way into L-Land, had once stood. It was really gone.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""...I...it's, uh..."" Tim sat, confused. ""I...I can't say."" He knew he knew what the object was, but he couldn't make his mouth say the word.

""Totally expected,"" the doctor replied assuredly. ""It indicates a complete partitioning of the hemispheres. Almost every patient who undergoes this treatment experiences at least some level of relief from their epilepsy"".

 Tim nodded.

""What this means, though,"" he continued, ""is that the two halves of your brain can no longer communicate with each other. So, if the side of your brain that processes images is unable to receive information from the side of your brain that knows your vocabulary...""

""I won't be able to remember the name for a simple object I see,"" Tim said, finishing the doctor's explanation.

""Correct. Typically you receive visual input in both halves, though, since you don't usually have one eye covered. So it won't be an issue in day-to-day life,"" the doctor explained.

""That's certainly good to know,"" Tim responded. ""Can I take this off now?"" he asked, gesturing to the patch on his eye.

""Of course.""

Tim lifted the patch away and focused both eyes on the object.

""Ah,"" he said, breathing a sigh of relief. ""A coffee mug.""",1,1745335090.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

""Our year-end performance reflects the success of our strategic pivot toward the government sector, which was the primary driver of our revenue growth. Gross margins also expanded by 600 basis points to 35%, highlighting the strength of our business model,"" said ADM Endeavors CEO Marc Johnson. ""With demand continuing to grow, our focus remains on increasing operational capacity. Construction of our new 100,000+ sq. ft. facility is nearly complete, and we expect it to open this summer, adding up to five times our current production capacity. This expansion will allow us to better serve existing customers while also capturing new business, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where a major competitor's exit has created additional opportunities.""

""An appraisal in October 2024 valued our new facility at $13 million, with an additional $3.7 million for the adjacent land, which is substantially higher than its carrying value. Yet, this asset value remains unrecognized in our market valuation,"" Mr. Johnson continued. ""Our dual strategy of organic growth and strategic acquisitions has positioned ADM to drive continued top-line growth while improving operational efficiencies. As we move into 2025, we remain confident in our ability to accelerate expansion, strengthen our market leadership in promotional products and school uniforms, and unlock long-term value for our shareholders.""

Recently I got a girl back to my apartment from a concert. Conversation at the show and in the car was easy and flowing but when we got inside my place I offered her a coffee or water (it was 5 am and we were both coming down from molly so not tired at all). She declined and then I didn’t really know what to do next. We sat on the couch awkwardly, chatted a bit about my place and things around the room, meanwhile my mind was racing trying to figure out how to close this. Ended up taking too long and she said she wanted to get a couple hours of sleep before work. I kissed her before she left and she said “sorry I didn’t fuck you” in a sarcastic way. Obviously the time of day and the fact she had work complicated matters but the opportunity was definitely there had I played my cards right.

My hands are balled into fists and my teeth are gritted. My muscles are straining to the point where I feel they are going to tear. That effort is the only thing restraining me from trying to hurt the person standing before me. I stare at her and feel something hateful burning in my chest.

She looks so smug. Just glancing at her face makes me want to scream. She knows exactly what she’s doing. That woman wants to get a reaction out of me. She’s drawing this out on purpose. That lying, backstabbing bitch betrayed me. I knew she would. It was only a matter of time. I saw the signs, I saw how she looked at other guys. There was that something in her eye that set off warning bells. I should’ve listened to them.

She’d brought one of those guys home today, but I got off work early. She’d tried to hide it, even distracting me with a cup of shitty coffee, but didn’t have enough time. I only took one sip of that burned slop before I saw her face over the rim of the mug. My wife was smiling too wide. I never saw her smile like that. 

Something was obviously wrong, so I abandoned the coffee and strode into our bedroom. This was where she would’ve committed the mistake. She trailed behind me, not even trying to stop my search. I immediately spotted a shadow in our closet and opened it to find the guy stuffed in there. Poor bastard.

His limbs were twisted at unnatural angles, one arm missing entirely. His head was facing the wrong direction and I swear he’d been snapped clean in half. Though the blood had partial congealed, there was still so much red.

Red is all over me now. The blood finally starts to leak from my ears, my contorted nails pierce my palms, and I feel my body begin to tear.

My husband and I are taking our 8 year old to Honolulu for a week at the end of August. This is our 10th anniversary trip back to the island (we were here for our honeymoon, this time with a kiddo). We're staying at Hilton Waikiki and will have a rental for the whole week there.

I'm thinking of booking a full day tour on Groupon. The tour includes free transportation, snacks and drinks, snorkeling and a guide. The reviews sound pretty good: the tour guides seem great; everyone has a good time with them. It would cost 237.33 for 3 people after discounts. 

We're thinking of taking this tour on the day after we arrive, which is also my son's birthday. Could you please let me know if this kind of tour is worth it or not? Or should we just drive to these spots and enjoy our own time (we will have to buy snorkeling gears if we go on our own, though.)

Here is the itinerary of the tour:

* **Diamond Head Lookout:** Capture stunning blue ocean water views from the beautiful Amelia Earhart lookout.
* **Halona Blowhole:** Witness nature’s power as waves burst through this unique rock formation.
* **Sandy Beach:** Experience fine sands and the thrill of powerful shore breaks on this famous beach.
* **Makapu'u Beach:** Stand at Oahu's easternmost point, 647 feet above the sea.
* **Waimanalo:** Relax on white sand beaches alongside sparkling turquoise waters.
* **Macadamia Nut Farm:** Visit a tropical farm on the Windward coast for delicious macadamia nuts.
* **Chinaman's Hat:** Discover Mokolii, also known among locals as Chinaman Heat because of its unique.
* **Shrimp Trucks:** Indulge in the famous North Shore shrimp truck experience.
* **Fruit Stands:** Savor the flavors of local fresh fruits and vegetables from local fruit stands.
* **Sunset Beach:** Immerse yourself in the beauty of this surfing paradise.
* **Banzai Pipeline:** Marvel at one of the world’s most renowned surf spots known for its barreling waves.
* **Waimea Bay:** Known for its giant 60ft winter waves and the Eddie Aikau Competition.
* **Laniakea:** Visit Turtle Beach, where you might spot sea turtles basking on the shore.
* **Haleiwa Town:** Marked by the historic Rainbow Bridge as you enter North Shore explore the charm of this place.
* **Dole Plantation:** Discover Oahu’s famous historical pineapple farm.
* **Coffee Farm:** Taste Hawaiian coffee roasted daily on-site at Oahu's first coffee visitor farm.

1k58rac,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1k58rac/i_lied_about_believing_in_jesus_to_my_family/,I lied about believing in Jesus to my family. Became religious and continued behaving as if I was.,"Hello everyone. I recently stopped believing in Christianity due to recognising how immoral and hypocritical it is. The reason I came to believe is complicated. 

During a time (2 or more years ago) of struggles with my mental health, I developed a psychotic disorder and became full blown religious and manic. This resulted in a stay at the psychiatric ward until I recovered. The entire time I was reading my bible, highlighting scirpiture and annotating the pages, and believing that God spoke to me constantly. The medications I was taking stabilised me for a time but the delusions and religiosity increased. I became a full blown zealot in the process and discarded my old beliefs about things I once had no problem with, all to honour God in my own mind with blind obedience. As a result, I became homophobic believing that the word of the Bible was truly God. I supported the word of a God who condones slavery and stoning homosexuals to death. I am ashamed about believing those things as I am bisexual myself and was open about that fact to other Christians, accepting who I am was wrong. I would battle with things like this frequently in my delusional state, until one day I spat into the open pages and slammed the leather shut, trashing the Bible for good. The compartmentalisation that took place was crazy ; believing that the Tale of Jonah and the whale or Noah's ark was true in any capacity. The entire time I could logically reason that these stories are impossible, but could trick myself into believing otherwise for quite some time. 

Prior to denouncing my faith it inspired me to make better decisions for myself and others. To forgive my family for all the hard times we had, to pursue something in life and wish to help others in the process if I can. As a result, severed ties have been reconnected with family, I had forgiven myself for my past actions and made amends with those in my life I'd hurt. I made friends with a nice lady (widow) at the church, and she would always drive me out to drink coffee after service chatting about the bible. The pastor drove me to hospital when I was ill, lent me books to read, and listened to me about the sexual abuse my father put me through in a non judgmental way. He gave me support during one of the hardest times of my life. I loved the people and sense of community it gave me. However, these things can be found elsewhere without religions influence. For years I had struggled in silence about the sexual abuse, and my family never believed a word of it. This got to the point where we were estranged for 8 years and I had no one else to turn to in life. The tension had boiled to the point of me being thrown out of home and arrested for common assault and attempted grievous bodily harm with a deadly weapon. As a result, I was homeless for a time and became addicted to hard drugs (3 years sober) and spent my life savings. 

I developed a belief in religion shortly before my most recent hospital stay, and used that as the catalyst for restoring the relationship I have with family, improving my mental health, pursuing a better career, going to the gym, and training for a job. I started living independently, paying my own rent, saving for higher education and restoring my credit score. I was a changed person when I began to work on myself. 

Nonetheless, after they had stopped one of my medications (venlafaxine), the religious thoughts began to slowly dissappear from my mind. My family attended my baptism, and I was highly involved in the church and its members. My family admired this about me, and would say that I have truly changed. I could finally move on and tell my mother and brother I loved them (despite not believing my father had molested me) and relinquish all negative feelings about them. My mother told me she is proud of me for the first time in a while. 

Anyway, now that I am not religious the situation is more complicated. I cannot let go of the fact that my family was proud of me for my actions and my ""devotion"" to the faith (despite being atheists). I have stopped attending the church which I was baptised in almost a year now, and with it being Easter Sunday, my mother's boyfriend asked me if I would like to go to Church. I said ""yes"", and he began to cry and gently put his hand on my shoulder, asking if I believe in Jesus. I said ""yes"" again. He never struck me as the religious type, and he and my mother have been on and off for a while. This entire situation is going to be very awkward to say the least because essentially, I am pretending to be religious at this point. My mother's boyfriend has gotten his act together now as he once was an alcoholic and always arguing with my mom. They seem really close now. I can see how my mother's boyfriend has changed due to the faith and it made me happy to an extent. But now I have to deal with returning to my church in about 8 hours from now for Easter service around all the believers who I once shared such a deep bond with.

I just don't know why I am pretending to be religious around my family at this point. Should I tell them I am no longer religious and cut the crap? I feel like they will not accept the fact I am changed person because I let go of my faith. But at the same time, it's none of their business. Whenever my mom or brothers asks about Church I just make up stories, or short answers as to not entertain the subject. I have an issue with compulsive lying and have been actively working towards fixing this for years. Part of that, was admitting to all the major lies I had told my family, and expressing my pattern of behaviour. They understood and are supportive of me. 

Would it just be better for me to flat out tell my mother's boyfriend and all the churchgoers tomorrow ""I do not believe in God anymore"". If my mothers boyfriend is shocked I will just flat out say I lied. He even gifted me a cross pendant earlier while crying. How do I navigate this situation? 

TLDR: Father molested me, was very mentally ill, family never believed me and was estranged for 8 years. I developed a psychotic illness and admitted to a mental hospital. Despite that religion motivated me to pursue my life goals and make amends with family. I attend church 3+ times a week. After living by myself, being independent and working on myself my family are proud of me. I lost my faith months ago. My mother's boyfriend is now very religious, and cried to me about Jesus today. He gave me a cross pendant as a gift. Now, I bear the responsibility of going back to my old church tomorrow despite not wanting this. Should I just tell my family and church I'm not religious anymore despite the fact they are proud of me for my actions and see my faith as a positive thing for me? I cannot agree with Christianity due to how immoral it is, and have recently broken free. ",3,1745334766.0,exchristian,0,1.0,False

1k58q9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1k58q9k/why_choose_the_hauck_uptown_deluxe_stroller/,Why Choose the Hauck Uptown Deluxe Stroller Review for Your Baby's Comfort?,"Testing out the Hauck H-14826 Uptown Deluxe Stroller on a daily basis has been quite an insightful experience for me. Being in the market for a stroller that blends functionality with style can be overwhelming, but this particular model stands out for several reasons. Featuring an aluminum frame and accents with a sleek leather look, it’s hard to ignore how sophisticated this stroller appears at first glance. I must admit, pushing this stroller around felt as though I was showing off a luxury item! Of course, beyond the appearance, my priority is practicality, and this stroller delivers plenty of it.

**Sophisticated and Stylish Design**  
The leather details and trendy white-wall tires of this stroller immediately turn heads. While testing it during an afternoon walk in the park, multiple parents stopped me to ask about it. It's chic yet sturdy, and the aluminum frame provides just the right amount of durability without being heavy. The stroller also features a Melange Rose color scheme that's subtle but classy, making it suitable for both boys and girls. With its modern aesthetics, it would easily complement a high-end diaper bag or any stylish parent on the go.

**Ease of Use and Compact Folding**  
One of the highlights for me has been the one-handed folding mechanism. Let me tell you, this feature is a lifesaver, especially when juggling a wriggly infant and a diaper bag. The stroller folds down compactly, fitting snugly in my car’s trunk without drama. What’s more, the practicality of its height-adjustable handle means that both taller individuals like my partner and shorter folks like me can push it comfortably. 

[Check Hauck H-14826 Uptown Deluxe Stroller price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b091d1vtt8/)

**Comfort Features for Your Little One**  
Comfort is crucial in any baby gear I choose, and this stroller does not disappoint. The puncture-resistant large rubber tires make for a smooth ride on both bumpy sidewalks and grassy trails. Whether seated upright or fully reclined for a quick snooze, it’s apparent that the adjustable backrest and footrest prioritize my child’s comfort. The large sun hood with UV protection 50+ is a godsend for sunny days, while the mesh window keeps the air circulating during warm outings.

**Safety Features That Reassure Parents**  
Knowing that this product includes a 5-point harness system gave me peace of mind. My little one was secure but not overly restrained, and the safety bar at the front made grabbing snacks or toys easy without compromising safety. The stroller meets ASTM and JPMA safety standards, which adds an extra layer of trust beyond daily use. I also appreciated its stroller brake system, which worked swiftly and ensured extra stability when parked.

**Practical Accessories and Storage**  
Another lovely touch is the included cup holder—because let’s be real, coffee is a parent’s fuel! The generously sized shopping basket under the stroller came in handy for supermarket runs and storing diaper bags, jackets, or toys. These small features show that the designers truly considered the needs of parents when creating this product. While it doesn’t have multiple cup holders, the single one is sufficient for quick outings.

**Pluses**  
- One-hand folding mechanism makes it convenient to store.  
- Sturdy aluminum frame paired with a chic aesthetic.  
- Adjustable features like handle height, backrest, and footrest cater to both kids and parents.  
- Smooth ride thanks to rubber wheels and effective suspension.  
- Built-in safety features like a 5-point harness and compliant to safety standards.  

**Critiques**  
- It’s hard to ignore that this stroller is on the heavier side, weighing 26.4 pounds, which can make lifting it into the car challenging.  
- The single cup holder could be an inconvenience for parents wanting space for additional drinks or bottles.  
- Although the leather accents elevate its look, they require extra care to maintain their shine and avoid wear.  

**Alternative Products**  
When comparing this model to similar strollers, several brands come to mind. For instance, UPPAbaby’s premium line of strollers offers a comparable style but comes at a significantly higher cost. Chicco's Bravo Trio is another contender; it’s lightweight and designed for convenience but lacks the luxurious aesthetic of the leather accents. Even Baby Jogger’s City Mini GT series, well-loved for its all-terrain capability, doesn’t offer the same level of style and ride comfort. However, the Hauck Uptown Deluxe balances functionality, aesthetics, and affordability better than many. I’d recommend this to those looking for a solid mid-range stroller that doesn’t sacrifice looks.

**Smart Spending**  
From a value perspective, the stroller is priced considering its robust build, safety features, and aesthetic appeal. While it's not the cheapest option in the market, I would argue that it falls in the range of affordable quality. If you’re the type that values a stroller as more than just a necessity but also as an accessory of sorts, this model offers plenty to love without tipping into outrageously high prices. It gets the job done with style and ease, suitable for various terrains and packed with parent-approved features.

Even though I'm married and feel confident that my husband loves me, I still get to go through the monthly gauntlet of convincing myself he hates me, I'm not good enough, and he will cheat just like everyone else has. You know, the works! Since tying it to PMDD I have been doing the work to check in with myself and chill out. Just trying to tone it down and choose my battles. Well I sure was presented with an opportunity yesterday and honestly I'm still hot about it 😅

My husband and I went to a coffee shop. We have been quite a few times before, but never like regularly and the last time we went was sometime in 2024. Pair this with the fact that we've never seen an employee there twice, and imagine me nearly going blind when the barista suddenly asked my husband, ""it's (his name), right?"" I was so stunned that I think I just blacked out because I can't really remember how the exchange went after that, until I checked back into reality because she was complimenting my RINGS!!! Girl why were you looking at our ring fingers?? What I do recall was super weird is that I was the one who started the order- I was directly in front of her, I told her it would be ""for here"", and then she starts talking to my husband and knowing his name?

Now I've had more than one girl be brave enough to hit on my husband in front of me, and so maybe it's all the residual anger from that because I know this situation wasn't as blatant, but WOW!! On the second day of luteal?? Girl you couldn't have picked a worse time to do this to me 😂.

I did talk with my husband about this and he was just as confused that she knew him. Granted, his name is Italian and very unique for our area, buttttttt like I said we haven't been there in a year and there's no reason for some random girl to remember him for that long based off of one customer interaction, in my opinion. So now for 24 hours I've just been trying to understand how she knows and remembers him, and trying my best to come up with innocent answers.

Gotta love feeling insane for 50% of my life.

I felt it had so much wasted potential.

I think *Hotel Reverie* could have been a truly great Black Mirror episode – i.e. one which really embodies the dark themes the show is meant to represent – but instead fumbled that in favor of a feelgood love(ish) story with a somewhat happy ending. I think there was real potential to fulfill this ""darkness"" with the Brandy and Clara plotline: we could have seen so much more of the untraditional bond/love develop between them, and Clara's understanding of her Westworld-like world grow, but instead Booker decided to end that plotline so abruptly and replace it with ""Brandy finishes the movie, with hesitation, and is sad about it."" Tbh I found the whole second half kind of lame. Would have loved to explore in more depth the world with Brandy and Clara.

On top of that, there's suspension of disbelief, and then there's the writer just trolling you. Most of the ""real-world"" plotline I feel like we could have done without; I found the attempts to stretch it into something believable only detracted from the heart of the episode: the hottest actress in the world is brought onto set without anyone clarifying if she knows what she's doing? The system being set up so that you *must* complete the movie as written otherwise the actress dies? No safeguards in place to prevent coffee from being spilt on the servers and destroying the whole network? (but only for a bit...)

She is always tired, which is probably partly from her diet, and unmotivated. Her doctor brushed off her fatigue so that's a work in progress. Most days she eats buttered toast and 4 peanut butter crackers. She is a huge fan of sweets. I've seen her eat 6 cookies in a day and she loves werthers caramel candy. I make her sandwiches but sometimes she doesn't have the appetite or motivation to eat them. She will eat a McDonald's hamburger if we give her one, but I know she needs more protein and calories. It's probably why she gets so cold too. It was 80° on Easter and she kept asking us to turn the fan off in our hot non air conditioned house.

She does drink coffee and milk, sometimes almost a whole gallon of milk a day. Maybe I could pour chocolate protein in the coffee? It's prepaid Delight coffee from Walmart. Or maybe mix protein powder in with her peanut butter? But I don't know if it would mold.

I was making her protein cookies a few months ago but she eats them all week and it's time consuming. The protein cookies at the store are expensive. Is there anything I can easily add? Any small snacks high in protein that won't take much effort to eat?",2,1745334460.0,AgingParents,2,1.0,False

\- 1 or 2 heads, but just consious that it will be transported so something that isn't monstrous to set up.

I spent some time thinking what I could write in my fanfic Tell me. It's about James POV between Defy me and Imagine me. It's mostly about James trying to find out more about his mother by bothering Anderson. ANYWAY it made me start pondering something...

(Watch me spoilers incoming)

In Watch me we learn that James is actually super traumatized from living in the orphanages and trying to survive under the RE regime. He has PTSD triggers when he hears children crying, for example. 

It made me wonder if he has any locked away memories from when he was even younger. From when Anderson would come home and beat up Adam.

We know that Adam would ""hide"" James whenever Anderson came home drunk, and we never hear that James remembers anything at all. James had no idea their father didn't ""die"" at the same time as their mother, after all. 

But realistically, I'm thinking James must have HEARD what was going on out there. Their house was small enough that Adam had to stay in his room whenever Anderson visited because he didn't want to have to look at him. Anderson would have been yelling, screaming, beating, throwing bottles. And it went on for a long time. James would have been one, two, three, four, five, six years old. (Based on the fact that Adam is 7 years older than James and their mother died when Adam was 8. Anderson stopped coming by when Adam was 14.) And now I'm wondering if the fact that James doesn't remember anything is not because Adam was very good at hiding him, but rather because James has repressed those memories. 

It makes me wonder if James would have a similar trauma respons when hearing/seeing someone get violently drunk. Or maybe it would be something even deeper, since he was even younger back then. Just this instinct to go hide in a closet until the threat has gone away...  ",4,1745334346.0,shatterme,2,1.0,False

They say “oh is that what you were insinuating”

I tell them I just want them to treat me like they do their friends. 

They reply that they would treat their friends the same if they spoke like that. 

Im confused and irate now. I said two words, “here [partner name]”, in a neutral, non confrontational tone while I am visibly opening a package. I feel gaslit and start getting visibly angry. I tell them I’m pretty sure you would say “oh hey thanks” if one of their friends did the same thing. 

They walk over, visibly pissed as I hand them the nose strips I ordered for their snoring. They don’t say thank you, just walked away towards the kitchen and started complaining to themself in a voice loud enough for me to hear about how horrible I am to deal with in the mornings, and then start to go on (sarcastically) about how they are the worst person in the world and how I can do no wrong, etc etc. Then complains just loud enough for me to hear how they just want a quiet morning without me complaining to them.

*Homeplate*

After their excursion to Vilantia, life settled into a routine of sorts for the spouses of the Legion. While a few of the spouses and attached personnel were content to make themselves useful with various basic tasks like maintenance of the legion area, some were looking to start a new life of sorts. Others were looking to continue their old careers in a new land. Even though they weren't on the ship, they carried some of the traditions – after a fashion. They didn't do curry night, but they would gather every week for a Spouses' Meal. The only rule was that everyone had to bring something new. There was wine, food, and gossip exchanged as everyone was finding new things and occasionally complaining about comforts they missed. It was odd in some ways – even though the spouses were not separated by rank or duty, their groupings seemed to mirror those on the ship.

Grezzk was listening and contemplating at this weeks' meal before she paused, a forkful of bison meatloaf halfway to her lips.

Kiole paused in her own eating, leaning to take a light sniff. ""My shield, you have something meaningful that awaits your tongue.""

There was a blink. ""Yes. Listen to our clanmates, speaking about what they can't find here. Could we not start something like the Vilantian-Hurdop Trade cooperative here? We sit, share food and stories, but we all have a yearning for the homeworld. If we cannot easily go to Mother Vilantia and Father Hurdop, then perhaps it is time they made their way here."" Her food was forgotten for the moment as a new thought danced in the background of her imagination, coming closer to being fully scented.

""It would cost.""

Grezzk nodded agreement. ""It would. But the income from everyone, pooled to purpose could bring things that would bring home here. Consider also, the other Legions that have formed and even the Throne's Dawn company. Proper brightwine, perishables – all the things that we forget until we lack them."" Grezzk continued eating. ""And not just goods, but services – how many children go waiting for a school with proper education? How many among the other Legions are like us, waiting and speaking wistfully of the hard times gone by?""

Kiole considered for a moment. ""It is similar among Father Hurdop's children.""

Lomeia's soft voice joined the conversation. ""From the scents of the other Legions it seems they are waiting for a Lord or Lady to tell them what to do.""

There was a long silence as Grezzk worked her mouth, a small pit of acid forming even as she spoke. ""Then we should.""

""Should what?"" Kiole seemed curious.

""Found something. Build something."" Grezzk paused. ""We will call it...something.""

Lomeia scrunched her face reflexively. ""The Ministries...""

""I suppose one advantage of being here. The Ministries have less sway now, I think.""

Lomeia looked down. ""They are still powerful. Even broken, the Ministry of Culture has voices that call to maintain the past.""

Kiole blinked as the tabletalk had died down, everyone catching a scent of something new from the two Freeladies conversation. ""Our Throne is less cautious, but agreed. The Ministries may not approve of our blending."" She rested her stump on her stomach with a light smile. ""Though they may not have much choice in the future. It has already begun.""

""Then we name it something that both cultures would accept as their own."" Grezzk shifted a bit, not entirely comfortable with her own proposal, causing her to pause. Ghabri and Glaud took note of the meatloaf that sat piled on their mothers' utensil and started squirming toward the tantalizing treat that hung just outside their grasp. ""I suppose the first thing we should do is ask questions.""

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk awoke to something resembling calm in his quarters; his tablet was full of new messages – along with the now-normal injury reports of someone hyperextending a joint or bruising something, there was a note requesting a conference with the *Stalwart Rose* after breakfast. He walked out to the bridge, looking forward to morning tea and breakfast.

Rosie was not in a good mood. ""Freelord Major, Captain Hoban said he's going to be late today and needs me to remain on the bridge.""

""Any particular reason?""

""Officially? 'Insomnia.' Unofficially, he was trying to talk the panties off of Miroka with ship-docking metaphors while she hinted he might look good with a beard until about three hours ago. Soon as he's on duty I'm going to lunch with Chief Tucker.""

""A question occurs – how do you know what they were talking about?""

Rosie favored him with a look that suggested he'd taken too many low-G-induced headers off the ceiling. ""Major, remember how I'm the AI? With access to every system on the ship, including comms? Other than that I know who says what, who they say it to, and what the favorite fanfic of the ship is – currently it's *Planet Texas*, where the company has to repopulate a planet made up entirely of clones of the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders and players while fighting off the heathens of Planet Philadelphia who wish to steal the secret sauce to create a new generation of Eagles. It's implied that you do most of the...heavy lifting."" Rosie let that sink in, and then continued, much to Gryzzk's dismay. ""I don't like it. Plot’s thinner than a set of Redlight lingerie and my job appears to be wearing scraps of cloth and informing the men that you have made it with a woman.""

""Was that synopsis entirely necessary?""

""Absolutely not, but I'm missing breakfast with Patrick, and I don't like suffering alone.""

Gryzzk went through breakfast and part of him marveled at the company. While he could certainly tell the newer troops from the originals, there didn't seem to be a large gap socially. It was very unlike what he'd seen growing up, where clans formed the core, and the spouses were almost strangers. Certainly he and Grezzk had been an oddity of sorts – the first of many, it seemed. Once the thoughts were completed, he saw a flash of purple as Nhoot was trying to beat her best time bouncing off the walls through the ship.

At least some parts of the ship were taking a positive spin on the situation. Gryzzk carefully made his way to the bridge and settled in with his tea as the rest of the bridge squad filed in to take their posts.

It was exactly nine am, and the day hadn't gone completely to crap. Gryzzk considered this a good day on the job. Fortunately, the squad was serious and attentive as they picked over items from the evening to correlate and build into something meaningful that might help with the day's events.

Reilly was the first to have something to report. ""Major, orbital traffic control requests we hold position for one hour before proceeding. Our current track is 'inelegant', according to them. A scathing review of the XO's piloting follows, saying it is machinelike and has no soul. They've got similar comments about Stewart's driving, if that helps.""

Rosie snorted. ""Advise Orbital Control that if they want soul they should put on some Roberta Flack and lick the warmest part of my coolant pipe.""

Gryzzk checked his tablet for a moment as the reports continued, this one from Edwards. ""Major, we've got four unknowns hovering at a good distance. Designs look like Hurdop, looks like they've got some dual registration happening – registrations under Throne's Fortune and the Guardians of Moncilat.""

O'Brien flexed her hands and put her coffee in the cup-holder. ""They're tracking, but no lock. It'll take thirty seconds to go from weapons cold to hot. Shields are up.""

Gryzzk considered. ""Get the torpedo bay to standby power.""

The sergeant major nodded. ""They'll be out and tracking five seconds after your go.""

""Reilly, get a channel to the other ships.""

""We're hot, Major.""

Gryzzk tugged his uniform shirt down slightly. ""This is Major Gryzzk. Currently we're tracking four unknowns carrying registrations from Hurdop and Moncilat. Defensive posture recommended.""

Captain Grant giggled. ""Oh, please let them try something.""

""Captain Grant, I remind you that the *Hyneman* is a civilian vessel with no armament.""

""While what you say is true, space is kind of a nasty place. We got plans for this.""

While they were having that discussion, the *Leafborn*'s captain chimed in. ""They are powering weapons and accelerating toward us."" With that pronouncement, the Moncilat escorts split to take very aesthetic but tactically useless positions with Captain Dulaine keeping his seat only with a mighty effort.

""Ooh time to show off."" With that the *Hyneman* launched itself at the Hurdop formation, the disc around the base of ship beginning to spin.

Gryzzk spat softly while Rosie sounded the alert for the company. ""Twilight...Captain Grant – be advised that some of those ships may be crewed by literal children, and you still have no weapons.""

Whatever else could be said, the *Hyneman* was fast, and Gryzzk noticed with a slight tinge of concern that it wasn't just the disc that was spinning, it was the entire ship itself. Or at least the exterior. The reply from Captain Grant was a cocky smile and a thumbs-up gesture. ""We don't need weapons, we've got physics.""

Gryzzk wasn't exactly in a position to drink deep of whatever wisdom the words carried. ""O'Brien, target their weapons. XO, optimal attack position attack."" He paused to address the holographic Captain Rostin. ""*Stalwart Rose*, recommend you maneuver and salvo the railguns into their engine compartments.""

""Ah-ah-ah yessir."" Gryzzks display shifted to tactical mode, removing the other captains and showing only the ships currently part of the engagement – the *Hyneman* continued to accelerate, shifting itself and then repositioning before firing engines and literally slamming itself into one ship, causing the impacted ship to spin wildly out of control. The *Hyneman* then ricocheted into two other ships, the disk simply shredding the structures that held the engines and exterior power conduits. The fourth ship, having seen the destructive power of the *Hyneman* decided that discretion was the better part of valor and beat the hastiest of retreats.

Rosie hmph'ed softly. ""And they bitch about *my* driving.""

Gryzzk blinked a few times. ""XO, save the critique of Orbital Control until we're sure we're clear. Edwards, detailed scan. O'Brien, keep weapons at standby power."" He paused for a moment. ""And at some point, someone will explain how the *Hyneman* is not a weapon.""

Rosie was the first to answer. ""Under the Terran Contact Armistice, weapons were extensively defined and delineated, with prohibition applied to civilian ships – defensive shielding is allowed, however weapons are not. The Collective failed to take Terran creativity into account when the Armistice was signed.""

""So the entire ship is a weapon.""

""Legally speaking it is a defensive exostructure. The fact that it just disabled three other ships in the time it took the other ships to say 'What the fuck is that' is entirely immaterial.""

Gryzzk had no reply beyond a heavy sigh. ""Is this something I will need to be aware of in the future?""

""Probably.""

Further conversation was interrupted by Reilly. ""So, we're being hailed. *Leafborn* and *Hyneman* want to talk.""

Captain Grant was in a celebratory mood – as his form returned to the holo, there was a dance and hip movement that reminded Gryzzk of a marionette being handled by a somewhat awkward string-master. ""Behold the power of science, bitches!""

Gryzzk's tone was dry. ""Consider it beheld, Captain Grant. Captain Dulaine, would it be possible to make arrangements for a tow and subsequent disposition of the three ships that the *Hyneman* ah, bumped into.""

Captain Dulaine swallowed and nodded. ""We...we can.""

""Very well. With that, I would like to re-schedule the morning conference for this afternoon, as I believe we have personnel required who are not available at this time.""

Dulaine exhaled sharply. ""I would prefer to speak with you privately, if possible.""

Gryzzk spread his hands casually. ""Of course. XO, please return the ship to coordinates previously designated by Orbital Control. Captains, if there is nothing further, I will be in conference with Captain Dulaine momentarily.""

Gryzzk gathered his cup and went to his quarters, where he replaced his tea with the jasmine-mint blend that seemed to be calming. Whatever was coming was going to be interesting. He settled in his chair and thought for a moment.

""XO, unless I say otherwise, consider the following conversation with Captain Dulaine to be quarantined.""

""Understood, Freelord Major.""

Gryzzk straightened his shirt again. ""Reilly, please send the communication through. Set scent transmission at fifty percent. I'd rather we not spook the good captain.""

It took a few moments, but Captain Dulaine's form resolved in his own private area. The light was warm, the scents heavy and moist. It was almost a garden, with plants flowering among structures that almost seemed to be alive themselves – the closest reference Gryzzk could think of was the mess hall with it's hydroponic system that fed the herbs along each wall. Despite the beauty behind him, Captain Dulaine's face was pinched.

""Major, I am hoping you can assist with a...delicate situation.""

Gryzzk knew what was coming next, but he needed confirmation. ""That covers a broad range of possibilities, Captain.""

There was a bit of a quirk – Gryzzk wasn't entirely sure how to read the expression, but the scent that came across seemed troubled. ""More than I had considered at first.""

""Which item weighs most heavily on you, Captain?""

""The...our helmsmen. They seem quite taken with each other and I fear she may have fallen to the perils of Captain Kirk Malady.""

""I've not heard of such a thing."" Gryzzk once again mentally cursed the upbringing that failed to include instruction of Terran interactions.

""The ancient Terran historical archive has fables of a spacefaring Captain Kirk who became romantically involved with many females of many species. While the fables themselves are obviously fiction, there seems to be a leaf of truth there. But the fables never speak of the aftermath, with the Terran gallivanting off to his next conquest, leaving an emotionally stricken individual hoping beyond hope for...whatever it is the Terrans have that is desirable.""

""And you have concerns that Hoban may leave your pilot in such a state?""

""Grave concerns. The Terrans even joke about it. 'Once you've been Riker'ed too, no others will do' is the shortest one. And the news has spread across the ship - I fear that with the actions of the *Hyneman* it will only worsen.""

There was a pensive sip of tea as Gryzzk considered how to frame things. ""Your desire to safeguard your crew is an admirable thing. I would recommend that you speak with your pilot in terms of how it has affected her professional duty. Once is understandable, but multiple times is cause for concern.""

""Would it be possible to advise how you've avoided your crew being...Kirk'ed?""

Gryzzk blinked. ""Well, a great deal of it has to do with our culture – Vilantians and Hurdop are sensitive to scent, and it appears that the necessary markers of compatibility are rare. With that said, my communications sergeant is currently involved with a native of Vilantia, which leads to my second piece of advice - communication. While all parties are adults, an unusual situation such as this is something worthy of direct professional counseling.""

""Does that actually work?""

""It seems to. My wife was the one who spoke with Sergeant Reilly regarding her – her relationship. Perhaps you could relay your concerns through the XO? Let her know that it's not embarrassing, but at the same time there is an expectation of her due to her rank and station.""

Captain Dulaine seemed to consider this. ""I think that may work. Now, the second concern – the Throne's Fortune group. We...our weaknesses are on display. We can defend quite well, but our tactical doctrine is one that does not seem to promise a fruitful end.""

""I am formulating a plan, however there may need to be agreement with the other ships. My species evolved as ambush predators, so the plan will likely align with that thinking.""

""I will leave you to it. I must speak with my XO.""

""Let me know if you require additional aid. Major Gryzzk out.""

Gryzzk sat there, quietly contemplating if he should punt the responsibility for talking to Hoban to Rosie. It was going to have to wait. He refilled his tea, and then stepped back onto the bridge with a sleepy looking Hoban was sitting at his station with a large container of coffee.

Hoban threw an awkward grin at Gryzzk once they were both settled. ""I, uh, sorry about sleeping in today Major, I just...well...time got away from us.""

Gryzzk exhaled softly. ""Captain Hoban, while I do not wish you to be an automaton, at the same time we have set an expectation that you will be on time and fit for duty. Events happened that could have used your professionalism. I look forward to seeing you at your post tomorrow. At the *proper* hour.""

Hoban looked down with a small amount of embarrassment. ""Yes sir.""

O'Brien glowered. ""Are me and the Old Man the only ones on this bridge capable of having a normal relationship?""

Reilly cleared her throat. ""You mean the Major who is currently married to two lovely ladies, one of whom hails from a planet that was up until recently the sworn enemy of the good Major's planet?""

The Sergeant Major paused as realization sank in. ""...***Fuck***.""

""In *any* event..."" Gryzzk attempted to steer the bridge conversation in a new direction before it became far too descriptive. ""We have another concern on our hands. The Throne's Fortune group. Three of their ships are in tow toward Moncilat. Once they are there, I would like for the XOs to...go through their luggage and determine where their base is, as well as any schematics of the layout. After that, we will leave the vessels adrift as bait. Throne's Fortune will send ships for a tow, leaving their defenses more vulnerable. At that point, we will be splitting each of our remaining ship's company into two groups. Moncilat ground teams will surveil and report activity that seems detrimental to our employers. The other team will be performing a ground-based assault. It is possible that the three ships in tow will be taken to another location, but we'll have to take the risk in order to have their base weakened and distracted. Our packet from Skunkworks included three probable bases where they're operating from, and I would like to have some certainty before we make an offensive move.""

""Spreading the butter kinda thin here Major."" O'Brien was fairly direct. ""Plus the gravitational swivel from Moncilat to Hurdop is going to wreck some knees.""

""Options?""

""Secure Moncilat first. If we try to move against the Throne's Fortune without covering our ass, we're one R-space beacon from them going to ground. Plus it gives bodies time to re-adjust.""

""Acceptable."" Gryzzk rose. ""XO, maintain course, the rest of the bridge squad will report to the conference room. Feel free to listen in and give recommendations. But if at all possible refrain from profane language in your analyses.""

The bridge squad piled into the conference with their refreshments. The hologram lit up with images of the other three captains, with Captain Dulaine lifting his hand for attention first.

""Captains, Major. I'm afraid I have grave news. The three ships that were in tow have...gone missing.""",23,1745334127.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

# It. Is. On.

The *2025 Calder Cup Playoffs* have officially begun, and YOUR Coachella Valley Firebirds are lighting the match in the only game on the AHL docket tonight. All eyes are on the desert as we host our old playoff punching bag: the *Calgary Wranglers*.

Yes, *that* Calgary—the same Wranglers squad we've sent packing in **back-to-back playoff runs**, and the same team we cooked to the tune of a **6-2 regular season record** this year. They came for redemption, but they'll have to settle for another heaping plate of disappointment à la Acrisure.

# What’s at Stake:

This is a **best-of-3 series**, all on home ice. Game 2 is Saturday, and if Calgary somehow finds a pulse, we’ll see them Sunday too. Win tonight, and we’ve got momentum. Win Saturday? We send Calgary back to Alberta wondering what just happened.

# Who’s Hot:

* **Jani Nyman**: Back from Kraken duty and looking like he's ready to roast some Wranglers. 28 goals on the season and probably not done.
* **Nikke Kokko**: The *rookie goalie of the year* is in his playoff bag. Bring shots, Calgary. He’s ready.
* **Ville Ottavainen, Cale Fleury & John Hayden**: Reassigned just in time to remind Calgary how cozy Acrisure is in spring.

# Calgary’s Outlook:

Let’s be honest—they’re the AHL’s version of a broken Roomba. They bump into the Firebirds every year, make a lot of noise, and then get swept into the offseason. Tonight marks Game 1 of what we’ll call their annual “Regret & Rebuild” series.

# Players to Watch – Calgary Wranglers

* Rory Kerins (C) Team leader in points (61) with 33 goals and 28 assists. Fast, shifty, and has a knack for creating scoring chances on the rush.  If Calgary generates any offense tonight, Kerins will probably be involved.
* Dryden Hunt (LW) Veteran presence and playoff-experience guy. Had a cup of coffee with the Flames this year and is back to stir things up physically and emotionally. Expect him to finish every check and get under the Firebirds’ skin.
* Martin Frk (RW) Formerly of the Ontario Reign, a force to be reckoned with (60 points). Better with apples than your grandma, with 33 assists in the regular season.
* Adam Klapka (RW) 6'8"" Czech skyscraper with 21 goals. Calgary fans call him a unicorn. Firebirds fans should call him “target practice.” He parks in front of the net and causes chaos. Clearing him out will be key. He's been with the Flames quite a bit this season, and is probably in town for tonight.
* Devin Cooley (G) Might has well call him ""Cool Hand Luke"" in the crease. He's got a good eye, and a record to prove it, with a .905 SV% and 2.94 Goals Against Average.

# Keys to the Game:

1. **Start Fast**: Calgary hasn’t figured out how to come back from deficits. Score early, score often
2. **Keep Your Cool:** The Wranglers love scrums. Let them collect penalty minutes like Pokémon cards.
3. **Feed the Big Guns**: Get Nyman and Meyers cooking. Let Kokko hold the line.

# A Few Chirps:

* Calgary has more assistant coaches than playoff series wins in the last two years.
* The only thing Calgary’s bringing to the playoffs is frequent flyer miles.
* Last time Calgary won a Game 1, TikTok was still mostly dance videos.

Here’s My Stack to Stay Sharp on GLP-1s, Low Carb, or Hard Dieting","If you’ve ever run **Tirzepatide, Retatrutide, or even Semaglutide**, you know the appetite suppression is real.

But so is the brain fog.

Whether it's low calories, poor sleep from fat loss, or just lower glucose levels from clean eating, a lot of people report **sluggish thinking, reduced memory, and lack of motivation** while cutting.

I refused to accept that trade-off—so I went hunting for a **biohacker stack that keeps my brain dialed in** even when I’m running a deficit.

Here’s what’s been working (and what didn’t):

# 🔥 The “Shred with Sharpness” Stack

**1. Semax + Selank (Nasal Spray Peptides)**  
• Semax boosts dopamine & BDNF → motivation + neuroplasticity  
• Selank reduces stress/anxiety + modulates GABA

✅ Use during fasting or early morning for clean mental energy  
✅ Especially effective if you’re coming off stims or trying to stay focused without caffeine

→ *Use a 1:1 split of 300–600mcg each per dose*

**2. MOTS-C (Mitochondrial Peptide)**  
• Boosts energy production + metabolic flexibility  
• Supports endurance and cognitive function on low-carb diets  
→ [**MOTS-C (10mg)**](https://aminoasylum.shop/product/mots-c-10mg/ref/1142/) – Code **MSQK6YWEU1**

*Inject 5mg 2–3x/week for optimal results*

**3. Alpha-GPC + L-Tyrosine + Theacrine**  
• Stimulates acetylcholine = focus, memory, alertness  
• Great for training days or deep work sessions  
• Theacrine = long-lasting caffeine alt, no crash or tolerance

**4. CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin (GH Peptide Stack)**  
• GH supports brain health, especially under caloric stress  
• Also helps with sleep quality and recovery = more mental clarity

→ [**CJC-1295**](https://researchchemhq.co/product/cjc-1295-no-dac-5mg/?ref=oyxnywoz)  
→ [**Ipamorelin**](https://researchchemhq.co/product/ipamorelin-5mg/?ref=oyxnywoz)  
Use **Code RHINFO** for 10% Off

# 🧠 Honorable Mentions

• **L-Carnitine (Injectable)** – Helps with mitochondrial energy, especially while fasting  
• **DSIP** – Improves deep sleep to avoid cognitive decline on a deficit  
→ [**DSIP**](https://swisschems.is/product/dsip-2mg-price-is-per-vial/ref/3626/)

# 📆 Example Daily Stack (Fasted AM / Focus Mode)

|Time|Compound|Dose|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Morning|Semax + Selank|300mcg each (nasal)|
|Fasted AM|MOTS-C|5mg IM|
|Pre-Work|Alpha-GPC + Tyrosine|300mg / 500mg|
|Night|DSIP|200–300mcg (optional)|
|2x/week|CJC/IPA stack|2mg each|

# 🧪 Results So Far:

✔ Zero brain fog on 500–700 calorie deficit  
✔ Deep sleep even while shredded  
✔ Retatrutide no longer crushes motivation  
✔ Still getting PRs in workouts, even dry  
✔ Mental clarity feels like I’m on 2 cups of coffee—but smooth

Cutting doesn’t have to mean losing your edge.

Gray propped my arm over his neck to hold me straight as we walked back through the trees. My consciousness slipped a few more times, but my body continued to move on autopilot despite it.

 

After a few minutes, my strength returned enough for me to be able to walk unaided. I wanted to run, to get out of this place as quickly as possible, but that wasn’t an option.

 

Fortunately for us, our path out of the woods was relatively straightforward. We didn’t get lost, and there were no more ghastly interruptions. We made it out in about 45 minutes.

 

We reached our respective cars and began to split off. This day finally seemed to be over.

 

“Hold on, Cole.” Gray said, breaking the long silence. “I can’t let you drive like this.”

 

“I’m okay. Seriously.” I answered.

 

“Nah, you’re not. Get in the car.”

 

“I’m not just gonna leave my car here, Gray.”

 

“Your eye is nearly fucking swollen shut and you look like hell. Come on. We’ll come back for it. There’s somewhere we gotta go anyway.” He said, demanding.

 

“...Fine.” I relented.

 

We drove down the dark country road. I still fought the urge to pass out. Gray was probably right about being in no state to drive. He took a few calls, it was difficult to focus on what he was saying, but a few of them seemed to be letting people know that he found me.

 

After about a half hour’s drive, we pulled up to a somewhat meager local pizza joint. The name ‘914 Pizza’ laid out inelegantly on a sign at the top.

 

“What are we doing here?” I asked as we stepped out of the car and strolled up to the front. Gray didn’t answer, just ushering me inside.

 

“Yo, why are the floors so fuckin’ filthy up in here!?” Gray yelled out into the nearly empty restaurant, louder than my head could handle. “Where you at, boy!?”

 

Out from the kitchen stepped a pale, thin man with a long, dirty blond mess of hair and beard.

 

“Well ho-lee shit!” The man called out, practically hopping the counter to get to us. A broad smile plastered over his face. “Let me grab the mop for you, old man. Get to work.”

 

The two exchanged a firm handshake and a quick hug. It seemed like it had been a while. Then the man turned to me and offered a far more formal handshake.

 

“Benji. Nice to meet you.”

 

I responded with my name and a smile, accepting the handshake. Looking at him, beyond his general dishevelment, his eyes were extremely kind and disarming.

 

“That looks like it hurts, god damn.” He remarked, gesturing to my eye.

 

“Its seen better.” I said, not noticing my own pun at first.

 

“She’s my new partner.” Gray jumped in. He didn’t say rookie this time.

 

“Shit!” Benji exclaimed, then muttered “I’m so sorry.” In mocked concern.

 

I snickered and gave my eyebrows a subtle raise as if to say “You have no idea.”

 

“Oh knock it off and grab us a slice, will ya?” Gray reprimanded.

 

“Yes, detective.” Benji answered with a dramatic salute before walking off. Gray and I sat in a corner booth.

 

“So you come here often then?” I deduced.

 

“You could say that.” Gray answered.

 

“Why did you bring me here?”

 

“Because neither of us have eaten all day and I’m fucking starving... And because earlier you asked why I came here from New York.”

 

“You came here for the pizza?” I questioned.

 

“Nah, I brought the pizza here. This is my place.”

 

“You’re kidding. You own this restaurant?”

 

“Well I used to. Now it’s Benji’s, he’s my protégé. But for a long time, yeah. Used to run it with my man Obi. We had a place back in Yonkers before that.”

 

“I’m... so confused.”

 

“He got me off the streets, Obi did. I was a mess, I was in all kinds of shit. 17 years old, homeless, living in the dump, high off my ass. Obi ran a pizza joint in the city. One night, I sneak in to rob the place after hours. But Obi was still there, he catches me. Coulda sent me to jail. Hell, many folks down there would’ve killed me. Instead he gave me a job. I mopped the floors and took out the trash. He let me stay in a room upstairs. I got food, I got money. He said as long as I got clean, I had a place with him. So I did. Never touched another needle.”

 

“Good man, Obi.”

 

“The best. So anyways, few years pass. He teaches me how to cook. He shows me all the recipes. It becomes, like, our thing. One day he says he wants to move over here because he’s got family. So I say “Let’s go, pops.” And off we go. Open up shop, call it 914 for Yonkers. Bringin’ a little New York to the east coast.”

 

“That’s... wow. I love it... How does becoming a detective fit into that?”

 

“Well...” Gray began to explain, but his cheery disposition faded. “It’s funny, I lived in the city all those years. I seen a lotta bad people. But it wasn’t until I got out here that I saw real evil... There was a serial killer in this town. 15 or 20 years ago now. A bad, bad man. Like you wouldn’t believe. One night Obi was... being Obi, trying to help a kid, and...”

 

Gray stopped for a moment and clicked his tongue before continuing, “After that, the restaurant wasn’t the same, and I wanted somethin’ different. I wanted to do what he did for me, and what he died doing. Just, help out, you know? ‘Cause I shouldn’t be alive. I’m alive ‘cause of him. So I gotta do right by him. That’s it.”

 

There wasn’t much else to say after that. Initially I was mad that he brought me here, under the somewhat false pretense that it would be important. But it was important in its own way. I was glad that he shared his story with me. And to be completely honest, the pizza was unbelievable.

 

Gray dropped me off at my place and I wobbled my way inside, ready to crash hard on my bed. But first I wanted to see the damage. I moved to the bathroom mirror to take a look at myself.

 

It was a bit rough. My eye was completely purple and shut by this point. There were a few scrapes and bruises. Nothing dire but I doubted I’d be able to take another selfie for the next little while.

 

One more thing was nagging at me as I looked at my face. Why was Donaldson afraid of me? Why did Harmony look at me like that? Aside from being battered, I looked otherwise like myself, I thought. Fairly unremarkable.

 

I grabbed an ice pack and I hopped online to check things out. Eight new followers on my experimental account. Along with three comments on my most recent selfie. The first was a slur. Lovely. Saw that coming. The second was three heart eye emojis. So I had that going for me. The third one said, “Whoa I love your eyes, are they really like that or is it Photoshopped?”

 

I was confused. What was wrong with my eyes? I looked at the selfie I posted. The lighting was bad and it was hard to see much at first, until I looked closer. I turned my brightness all the way up and squinted at the screen.

 

“What the fuck?” I said out loud in my dark room.

 

I couldn’t believe it... My eyes were two different colors. My right eye was greenish hazel, like it had always been, but my left eye was now blue. Very blue. Was it just a trick of the light? It had to be, I thought. But then another thought crept into my mind.

 

I’ve seen blue eyes like that so many times these past few days. The image of Harmony’s face inches away from mine was stuck in my head. Her left eye was gone, but her right eye was still the exact same blue.

 

“No.” I said dismissively. It’s not. It can’t be. How would it be possible? What would that even mean?

 

I left that page and moved over to check my messages and it all dropped from my mind once I saw that I finally got a response about the deleted video.

 

“I gotchu fam. All her videos and streams are archived here.” The message read, along with a link to a channel on some bootleg YouTube clone. Unsettling, but in this case, efficient.

 

At first I wasn’t sure what to look for on this channel of hundreds, if not thousands of videos. Fortunately, the uploads were all chronological, so all I had to do was cross-reference these uploads with her official uploads to find which ones don’t match up. Maybe there was more than one deleted video.

 

I found the one in the infamous red top, and then to be thorough I combed through the rest. I managed to find two more. I began with the earliest one, dated three years ago.

 

“Hello my lovelies, who’s ready for some story time?” She began, with her beaming smile as she sat in front of the camera on a small leather sofa. “I got this comment from someone on an earlier video, and they were basically saying that they don’t trust medication. Meaning, like, mental health related medication. And they listed their reasons, and that’s fair enough, but it got me thinking that maybe I should talk about my own stuff. Maybe just to offer my own insight, if you’re worried about medication and how it could affect you and things like that. To add on to that, all proceeds from this video will be going to a mental health awareness charity which I’ll discuss more in a bit... But to start with my own experience, I’m actually on several medications right now, believe it or not.”

 

Initially the video didn’t seem to be related. I could see her deleting it due to the personal nature of the content. Maybe it hurt her brand, or maybe she just preferred to keep that side of her a secret.

 

She talked about her experience with anti-depressants for a few minutes. I admit I was engaged with what she was saying. I always was. She had that way about her. Nothing about the girl in the video was the same as the girl in the woods. Not a single thing.

 

“The other main medication I’m on is for seizures.” She explained. “I used to, and still sometimes do, get really bad seizures and really bad migraines. The anti-depressants actually also help with the migraines to an extent by the way. And this leads to the funny story of the day, because I don’t want this to be all serious.”

 

She took a swig of water and then searched for her story’s starting point. “You guys know I don’t believe in... like... astrology, or ghosts, or god, or premonitions or anything like that. I did have to go to Christian schools as a kid but I hated it. So anyways, I’m not saying that what I’m about to say is any of that superstitious stuff. It’s just funny... I don’t remember when the first time it happened was, but it became a thing in my family and at school as a kid where any time I would have a really bad migraine, something bad would happen, like, that day or the next day. An accident, or someone getting injured, or a pet dying, grandparent, etc. – I’m not saying it was funny at the time. God. That makes me sound like such an asshole. No, it was awful. But any time I’d be in class and I’d feel a migraine coming on, everyone would act all afraid and give me shit. They literally started talking quietly and massaging my head and neck to try and get it to stop before it started. I’d be like “I’m sorry guys, it’s happening.” And they would get all dramatic. Even the teachers started getting in on it. It was wild. I got called Carrie sometimes... But yeah, these headaches sucked. It would be like a fireplace poker right behind my eye, every time.”

 

Her cadence was so casual and friendly, but I couldn’t help feeling unsettled. My mind could only draw connections. The fireplace poker behind the eye. That was exactly how I’d been feeling for the past few days. Her story about the headaches being some kind of harbinger of terrible things, of course it was just a silly series of coincidences, but what if it wasn’t? And what does it mean if those headaches never go away?

 

I decided it was time to do some unpacking. This was all too much to keep in my head all at once, and Gray was right about one thing: Physical paper does feel better.

 

We had our own evidence board at the office, but there were several things I couldn’t reasonably put on there without my sanity being called into question. I hung my big cork board on the wall and dug out my simple supplies: A pack of sharpie, multiple packs of index cards, and a gargantuan tube of thumbtacks. I omitted getting a classic spool of red thread, it never seemed all that practical to me. Also I bought the thumbtacks online and they ended up being the flat, metal kind which you can’t tie thread around, so we do without.

 

[Dreams. Left Eye. Missing Goats. Candle Caine. Headaches. Fake Videos. ]()I wrote out the strangest pieces vaguely on index cards and hung them up. Hoping that maybe if I stared at them long enough, it would all make sense. But that didn’t seem to be happening right now, so I moved on to the second deleted video.

 

“Hello my lovelies, who’s ready for some story time?” Harmony greeted once again. This video was from only ten months ago, but the set up was largely the same. She began with some general life updates, before coming forth with a question.

 

“Have you guys ever had a reoccurring nightmare?”

 

I shuddered at the question... Not until very recently.

 

“I just had this dream last night, and it reminded me of a nightmare I used to have as a kid almost every night. There was this-“

 

I knew exactly what she was about to say. I mouthed her words as she said them.

 

“-Man in a hat.”

 

I paused the video and sat back in my chair. My breathing began to accelerate and my body physically shivered, but I talked myself down. No. It’s a common nightmare. The Hat Man. Lots of people talk about this phenomenon. It’s nothing.

 

“I would be paralyzed in my bed, and I’d see him come out of the shadows towards me. He always held out this weird looking fancy cup, or chalice, or goblet I guess you could call it... It was gold, I think.”

 

My slim justification went up in smoke just like that. To deny it any more would be ridiculous. It was the same dream. The same man, and the same chalice. The more she spoke, the more I knew it to be true. But it couldn’t be. This was not how the real world works. This was not reality. Those words replayed over and over in my mind like a desperate incantation. A hopeless cling to the skin of what I knew this world to be, as it spun me out of control. Not reality. Not reality. Not reality.

 

One video left. The one she posted right before leaving on that fake trip. After the Candle Caine game. I shuddered at the thought of what this one could be. I pressed play.

 

To her fans’ credit, they were right about the red top. It was stunning on her. Her wardrobe, make-up, and overall production design undeniably got more refined and sophisticated over the years. But she was still her. For now.

 

“Hello my lovelies, today it is our monthly unboxing video!” She beamed with excitement. “As I always say, you all NEVER have to send me anything. Seriously. But I appreciate every single one of you who sends things in, it means the world to me, and these days are my absolute favorite days of the month. So let’s get into it!”

 

The first five boxes or so were relatively normal. Some plushies, a signed copy of her favorite game, a coloring set, things like that. Then she came to an unmarked box. Rectangular, about a foot in length and maybe 8 inches wide and thick. She apologized for not being able to credit the gifter, and then she began to open it.

 

She went through several expressions as she looked inside, settling on happy but curious.

 

“This looks... fancy as hell. This looks expensive, who sent this?” She remarked. I felt dread consume me. I once again knew what was coming. I knew when she reached into the box what she was going to pull out. And I was right.

 

“Some kind of... medieval looking chalice? Oh my god, you guys... It’s heavy. This is like... real. What on earth? I feel like a queen with this thing, this is amazing. Thank you so much, whoever sent this. You better not have spent a lot on it, I would feel so bad. Please, if you’re watching, send me a private message, I want to know what the story is here.”

 

She giggled as she studied it in her hands. Then her brow began to furrow.

 

“Is this... from something? Is this from a game we played on stream? I feel like I’ve seen this. It reminds me so much of... something.”

 

I wanted to shout through the screen. Tell her to throw it away. Tell her to run. But I know she never did.

 

My hands were shaking and my head was throbbing. The chalice was real. That means the man in the hat must be real. He took her. He changed her into whatever she is now. That chalice had to be how he did it. Some kind of fucked up ritual. Who was he? What was he? Had he been planning this for her whole life? And why now does he come to me at night?

 

I tried my best to put it together, but it didn’t fit. How could this connect to Candle Caine? Candle Caine was an internet thing that just popped up this year, and that she happened upon at random, how could that relate to a dream from her childhood? It didn’t make sense.

 

I couldn’t hang on any longer. I had to go to sleep, as much as I was dreading it. As much as everything seemed to be going a mile a minute. I had to stop.

 

The Man in the Hat. I wrote it on one more index card and stuck it to the cork board. Then I popped a few more painkillers and some melatonin and collapsed on my bed, falling into a deep sleep almost immediately. Then the dream began.

 

I stood at my bathroom mirror, looking deep into my reflection. Only I didn’t see me as I am now. I saw the old me. The me I fought so hard to change. I was afraid of her. She taunted me. I didn’t want to go back. But did I deserve to stay?

 

I held my eyes closed, praying that when I opened them I would see the real me again. But I didn’t. It was still the other one. I tried again, and it was the same. I tried a third time, and this time it finally wasn’t her.

 

It... wasn’t anyone. I had no reflection anymore. I looked in the mirror and saw no one. I was no one.

 

I stared and stared into the lack of me, then I felt my skin begin to bubble and stretch. My body began to change. My bones popped and morphed. I felt my muscles slide up and down into place under my skin. I began to panic. I couldn’t go back.

 

I put my hands to my face, trying to hold everything together. To force it not to change. But my fingers slid inside my skin. Slid through the muscle and tissue. I could feel my own skull. I could feel my eyes in their sockets underneath my eyelids. I could feel the roots of my teeth underneath my gums. It was all beginning to soften. I knew I couldn’t keep it together. I knew I couldn’t stay me anymore. With a subtle brush of my fingers against my teeth roots, I could make them fall out like they were nothing.

 

That’s what I began to do. Dislodging my back teeth one by one. It felt uncomfortable having them there. They had to go. Then I grabbed my front teeth in a handful and dropped them all, hearing their hollow clattering into the sink. I did the same with all my bottom teeth. Every last one had to go.

 

I sunk my hands deeper into my face. I sunk them inside my skull. It was all soft like putty now. I played with the strings on my back of my eyeballs and watched as they popped in and out of their sockets. Eventually I grabbed them both in one hand and yanked them out. I didn’t want them anymore. I didn’t want anything anymore. I would rather be nothing. I would rather be no one. I deserved to be no one. My body was wasted on me.

 

I raised one of my eyeballs to face myself so I could see what I had done. I saw a face of melting wax. The holes of my eyes and mouth stretched down and became cavernous voids. But my eye holes weren’t as empty as I thought. Deep in the two black abysses, I saw new eyes. Only they weren’t my eyes.

 

They were the most horrible eyes I had ever seen. Like every bad thing to ever exist lived inside of them.

 

I woke up screaming. Those eyes seared into my vision like an old TV. Quickly my screams turned to violent sobs. It all flooded out in a torrent. I couldn’t hold the pieces together any more.

 

I cried about it all. I cried about things I didn’t even know I was still holding on to. It was like one domino fell and then it all came crashing down. I cried until I ran out of tears.

 

My head hurt even worse today, and the respite of sleep was slim to none. I skipped my workout altogether and went straight for the coffee and painkillers. I put on my sunglasses when I went out and I didn’t plan on taking them off until I was back home in the dark.

 

“Jesus, Cole.” Gray remarked as he picked me up from my place.

 

“I know.” I curtly answered.

 

“You look like fuckin’ roadkill.”

 

“We have to go see Harmony’s mother again.” I said, ignoring his probably accurate jab.

 

“You wanna get your car first?”

 

“After.”

 

“Okay. What for? What did you get?”

 

I explained what I found in the videos as we drove. I thought about fabricating the whole thing to make it seem more tangible and plausible, but I decided to keep Gray in the loop for now. I did omit certain details, such as the dreams I’ve been having. Surprisingly Gray was fairly receptive to these bizarre findings... It made me think. He said he had seen weird things in this place before. I had to wonder how weird.

 

“So, what, you think this man she dreamed about was real?”

 

“If the chalice was real, then maybe. Maybe it was some kind of repressed memory... It has to be connected somehow.”

 

“This is pretty flimsy, Cole. It’s pretty out-there. I’ll go with you on it, but I need you back to reality. I need you to take a step back and take care of yourself a little bit, you know?”

 

“Yeah.” I answered, more dismissively than I intended.

 

We reached Evelyn’s house and knocked on the door. She opened, and for a moment I saw myself. She looked disheveled and sleep deprived. I could tell she had been crying. But of course she had.

 

“How are you holdin’ up, Evelyn?” Gray asked.

 

“How do you think?” She answered, gesturing vaguely at the world. “Any news? Please tell me there’s news.”

 

“I’m afraid we’re still looking.” I interjected. “But there may be something you can help us with.”

 

“Of course. Anything.”

 

“This might sound strange... Do you remember your daughter, as a child, ever mentioning a man in a wide brimmed hat?”

 

“Um...” She responded, puzzled at my question.

 

“Even if it was just a bad dream, do you remember anything like that she may have mentioned?”

 

“Oh. Well yeah, she used to have a nightmare about a shadow man in a hat when she was around 6 or 8. Sure, I remember that... I think that was just because she didn’t like nursery school.”

 

“How’s that?”

 

“She was afraid of going. She didn’t like it, she never liked the religious schools. And Father Whitley, he was a priest and did a lot of early bible lessons with the kids, and he wore this hat...”

 

“Whitley... The guy who runs the soup kitchen? ‘Blessings’ or whatever it was called?” I asked, trying to hide my shock.

 

“Yeah, him. The school closed down a long time ago, but he still comes to church.”

 

“Okay... So Father Whitley... did he ever take a special interest in Harmony?”

 

“Well... I suppose, but only because he was a friend of the family. Before Harmony was even born. He was a great guy. He was always very generous and patient with Harmony... You... You think he had something to with this?”

 

“We’re just covering all our bases.”

 

Evelyn began staggering back and beginning to cry. “I didn’t know. I didn’t think he would ever... I trusted him.”

 

Gray reached out and placed an arm on her shoulder. “Hey. It’s okay. We’re not saying he did this. Don’t you beat yourself up now.”

 

“Please find her!” She pleaded through her sobs. “Please find her and bring her home!”

 

“I promise, Evelyn. We’ll bring her home.” Gray said. “You stay strong now, alright? Stay strong for your girl. She’s gonna need her moms.”

 

Gray and I both let out a long and shaky exhale when we eventually left Evelyn’s house. Any other time I would’ve been able to compose myself better, but I was worn down. My emotions were quickly becoming compromised.

 

“I don’t know if you should have made that promise, Gray.”

 

Gray shook his head. “I know. But what was I supposed to do?”

 

I stayed silent, as I had no answer. I wanted to promise the same thing. But I knew deep down that she wouldn’t be coming back. Not the girl she knew. Not the girl with that kind, effortless smile. Even if we got her back, even if we managed to undo whatever had been done to her, that girl would be gone.

 

It hurt me more than it should. More than it has in any other case, and that frustrated me. I knew better. I knew better than to get attached. You can’t do that in this job. I knew that, I recognized that, and I practiced that for years. Why was this one different? Why was SHE different?

 

It didn’t take long to find Whitley. We knew where he worked. He lived close. It was time to pay him a visit. No time to waste.

 

We quickly arrived at his place. It was a very small and run down little house. Any smaller and it would be a trailer. Nothing immediately stood out as strange about it. It seemed to fit in. But for a man of his social standing, I expected a little bit more.

 

Imagines of the man from my dreams – our dreams – flashed through my mind. That dark and imposing figure. Was that really Whitley? He was so old and gentle when I met him at the soup kitchen. He was softspoken and his words were filled with such kindness and humility. I knew not to judge books by their covers, but this was a hell of a cover.

 

Gray knocked on the door and it was hastily opened. As unassuming as the house was, the man was perhaps even more so. He was tall, around 6’1, and held a firm posture. His thin lips twisted into a smile of indeterminate intention.

 

“How may I help you?” He asked, but the way he said it made it sound like he already knew the answer. His voice was breathy with a slight regional twist, but it exuded a confidence that was... different.

 

“Good afternoon Mr. Whitley, we just wanted to ask you a few questions.” Gray stated with a friendly tone.

 

“I see. What is this regarding? Something about Melvin?”

 

“You knew the missing girl Harmony and her family, did you not?” I asked, cutting to the point.

 

“Ah, yes. They were dear friends. So terrible to hear she had gone missing.” As Whitley spoke it was obvious he was hiding a smile. When he finished his deeply insincere statement, the smile returned as full as ever. It WAS him, and he wasn’t even trying. I was getting furious.

 

There’s a delicacy to questioning someone. It’s like a game, to try and extract information from a suspect. A social game. I don’t know what it was that compelled me to completely forego procedure. Maybe it was the fact that I knew this was the guy. Maybe it was the fact that he seemed to be enjoying the game, and that bothered me. Whatever it was, I chose to end it early.

 

“What did you do to her?” I asked calmly. I saw Gray out of the corner of my eye turn towards me. I could only imagine the look on his face.

 

Ray snickered. “What makes you think I had something to do with it?”

 

“I know you did. Don’t lie to me.”

 

Gray leaned in a muttered to me with urgency and building rage, “Cole, what the fuck are you doing?”

 

I ignored him and continued to press. “Tell me what you did to her.”

 

Whitley laughed again. “It don’t matter now. What’s done is done.”

 

“Talk.” I insisted.

 

“You’re too late, kiddo.”

 

I hated that he called me that. I hated it so much more than when Gray said it. My voice raised.

 

“You think we won’t put you away for this? You think you got off scott-free?”

 

Whitley leaned in uncomfortably close to me and smiled even wider. I saw his crooked teeth and smelled his rotten breath. “I did it. I confess. I took Harmony. Arrest me.”

 

I lost my temper entirely. I quickly unholstered my weapon and pointed it at his head.

 

“What the fuck kind of game are you playing!?” I shouted at his face.

 

“Hands behind your back! Get on your knees!” Gray yelled before turning to me. “Cole, step the fuck back!”

 

Whitley dutifully put his hands behind his back and got down on his knees. I didn’t take my gun away from his head, even as Gray physically pushed me back.

 

“She was our lamb from the beginning.” Whitley taunted to me. “She was born unto a greater purpose and now that purpose has been fulfilled.”

 

“What does that mean!?” I yelled. Gray began to handcuff him.

 

“The game was for her. It was always for her. My work is done. For the father. He will have new skin. He will have eyes.” Whitley drew a long, slow sigh and closed his eyes before continuing. “My candle hath burned out.”

 

Gray shouted in pain and recoiled before he could get the last cuff secured. I didn’t see what happened at first, but his hand began to drip with blood almost immediately. Whitley moved quickly back to his feet and I saw the glint of something metallic in his hand as he thrusted it towards Gray with immense speed.

 

I pulled the trigger. The shot hit Whitley in the temple and exited the other side with a firework of blood. He collapsed instantly.

 

Gray clutched his bleeding hand and shouted obscenities. My entire body shook with adrenaline and rage. I knew I made a mistake. I knew I did what he wanted me to do. The one person who could tell us the truth was now gone.

 

“Cole, what the FUCK!?” Gray snapped at me.

 

“He was going to kill you!” I yelled.

 

“Not that! Fuck him! What aren’t you telling me!?”

 

“What!? What do you want me to say!?”

 

“The truth! What the hell happened here, Cole!? Coming up here throwing accusations in his face, pulling your gun out, that’s not what we do! Not when the only evidence against the man is a little girl’s bad dream! You know more! You tell me what you know, right fucking now!”

 

I clenched my fists and relented. “It wasn’t just her dream! Okay? It was my dream too.”

 

“What? What the fuck does that even mean?”

 

“Fuck!” I screamed. “Alright, you wanna hear it? Fine. Ever since I took this case, I’ve been having the exact same dreams that Harmony had. The man in the hat with the chalice. As soon as I saw Whitley, I knew it was him because I’ve seen him every fucking night. I’ve seen what she has seen. I’ve felt what she has felt. My headaches are her headaches.”

 

I ripped my sunglasses off and threw them to the ground. “Look! Look at my fucking eye. This isn’t my eye. It’s hers. You want the truth? That’s the truth, and I don’t understand it any better than you do. And I know how I sound right now. I know. You have no idea how humiliated I feel to even have to speak these words out loud, but there they are... You can call me crazy, you can get me fired. Hell, have me committed, I don’t care. Just find the fucking girl.”

 

Gray just shook his head and angrily paced for a minute before finding his response.

 

“Listen. I don’t care how humiliated you feel, or how crazy you think you sound, I need to know this shit! I need to know everything! You are supposed to be my partner. Whether either of us likes it or not, that means something. That means trust. That means having each others’ backs. I’m not gonna get you fired. I’m not gonna have you committed. But you need to get a grip.”

 

I took a moment to slow my breathing and my heart rate, despite worrying that tears would follow. “Okay... You’re right, and I’m sorry... I’m not like this, Gray. I am good at what I do. This case is just... different. The shit we’re digging into, I feel it digging back into me. I can’t get a grip on reality, I don’t know what reality is anymore.”

 

“I know you’re good at this job.” Gray assured me. “You wouldn’t have made it this far if you weren’t. There is something about this case that’s not right, I agree with you. You think I can’t feel it, I can. I feel it in the goddamn air. So maybe I don’t need you to get a grip on reality, but I need you to get a grip on yourself.”

 

“I’m trying... But I need you to tell me something. Because I think you’re holding out on me too.” I accused.

 

“What? What the hell do you mean?”

 

“I mean I’m glad you’re not calling me crazy, and I’m glad you’ve been hearing me out, but why? Why do you have any faith in me? Why would you, Detective Gray, humor me on this insane bullshit without any proof?”

 

“What are you implying?”

 

“I’m not implying anything. I’m not. I just don’t understand.”

 

“I’m not holding out on you, Cole. I just know this place... It’s a great place to live and 99% of the people are the friendliest you’ll meet, but sometimes I felt safer on the streets of Yonkers than I do on these dirt roads... Things happen out here. You hear stories, and if you’re in our line of work, you become part of them. Eventually, when you do this as long as me, you discover that sometimes the crazy shit people say ain’t always that crazy.”

 

It was hard to parse how I felt upon hearing that from Gray. He was as salt of the earth as they come. A man like him wouldn’t say something like that unless he had some damn good reasons. Frankly, it scared me to death. But at the same time, I felt a level of vindication and comfort in his words. For the first time I didn’t feel completely insane or completely alone.

 

“Well maybe I need to hear these stories.” I responded, forcing my emotions to simmer down.

 

“I’ll think about it. Talk to Benji, he runs a whole goddamn website about the ‘maritime mysteries’, and I’m sure he would love if one person read it... For now, let’s call this in. It’s gonna be a long day.”

 

He was not wrong. It was hell. Fortunately, our brief talk with Mr. Whitley was recorded by Gray. The wound on Gray’s hand and the knife that delivered it were pretty airtight as evidence as well. Still, I didn’t imagine I would be well liked after this. The new city girl detective shooting one of the pillars of the community in the head in her first month on the job wasn’t great optics, no matter how you spun it.

 

I struggled with how I felt about what I did. It wasn’t the first time that I had to shoot someone, but it was the first time that I WANTED to shoot someone. I fucked our investigation, but I was happy that he was dead.

I’m on day 8 of it and used the titrating method. I’m super sensitive to medication so they started me off with 37.5 mg extended release. I popped open the little capsule and took about half the beads for a week then 2 days ago moved up to about 3/4th of the beads. I also have a prescription for klonopin along side this which I don’t think I would have lasted this long without it so I definitely recommend getting a short term benzo to take with an antidepressant. I also decided to take the medication at night to sleep through any of the “major side effects.” I didn’t sleep that great the first night and then the night I increased my dose and got extremely hot throughout the night and the next morning felt almost hungover (I like to describe it as getting hit by a bus) but there was no major panic or anything that was in my opinion scary(and I have some major anxiety around side effects of stuff). I also had a decent amount of brain fog or feeling like I was strictly on auto pilot like my focus went out the window but that went away after a few days. 

The 2 other things I noticed were weird headaches on one side of my head that would come up for a few minutes and then go away. I also am extremely exhausted. Which I’m wondering if or when that goes away. I drink coffee in the morning and it doesn’t seem to help keep me awake like I just want to nap all day. That could also be the klonopin though. 

Anyways curious when people started feeling like the side effects wore off for them and felt somewhat normal again.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best coffee body washes of 2025 are differentiated by their unique blend of ingredients, skin-nourishing properties, and, of course, the intensity and quality of their coffee aroma. Let鈥檚 take a closer look at the key features that set these products apart.

**Coffee Bean Extract Concentration:** The amount of coffee bean extract is crucial in determining the intensity of the coffee aroma and the potential benefits for the skin.

A higher concentration typically translates to a stronger, more invigorating scent, as well as a greater likelihood of experiencing the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties associated with coffee. Some brands also specify the type of coffee bean used, such as Arabica or Robusta, which can influence both the aroma and the potential benefits. The top contenders in 2025 prioritize high concentrations from ethically sourced beans.

**Exfoliating Agents:** Many coffee body washes incorporate exfoliating agents to slough away dead skin cells and reveal smoother, brighter skin.

These agents can range from ground coffee beans to gentle chemical exfoliants like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs). The coarseness and type of exfoliant will determine how aggressive the scrub is, making it important to choose one that suits your skin type and sensitivity. The best options offer a balance between effective exfoliation and gentle care.

**Hydrating Ingredients:** Coffee can sometimes be drying, so the inclusion of hydrating ingredients is essential for maintaining healthy, moisturized skin.

Look for body washes that contain ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, shea butter, aloe vera, or natural oils. These ingredients help to replenish moisture lost during cleansing, preventing dryness and irritation. The formulation should create a harmonious balance that cleanses and invigorates without stripping the skin of its natural oils.

**Scent Profile:** Beyond the coffee aroma, the best body washes often feature complementary scents that enhance the overall sensory experience.

These can include notes of vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, citrus, or other spices. The combination of scents should be well-balanced and appealing, creating a luxurious and invigorating aroma that lingers on the skin after showering. A complex scent profile can elevate the shower experience from a simple cleanse to a spa-like ritual.

**Sustainability and Ethical Sourcing:** In 2025, consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impact of their purchasing decisions.

The top coffee body washes prioritize sustainability by using ethically sourced coffee beans, eco-friendly packaging, and cruelty-free formulations. Look for certifications like Fair Trade or Rainforest Alliance, which indicate that the beans were sourced in a way that supports farmers and protects the environment. Sustainable practices contribute to a product's overall value and appeal.

**Formulation and pH Balance:** The overall formulation of the body wash and its pH balance play a significant role in its gentleness and effectiveness.

A pH-balanced formula helps to maintain the skin's natural barrier, preventing dryness, irritation, and other skin problems. Look for body washes that are free of harsh sulfates, parabens, and other potentially irritating ingredients. A gentle, well-formulated body wash will cleanse effectively without disrupting the skin's delicate balance.

 ## Core Benefits

Coffee body washes offer a range of benefits, from invigorating your senses to improving the appearance and texture of your skin. Here are some core benefits that make these products a popular choice.

**Energizing Aroma:** The strong, rich aroma of coffee is known for its stimulating and energizing effects. Starting your day with a coffee-scented body wash can provide a mental boost, helping you feel more alert and focused. The scent can also help to improve your mood and reduce stress levels.

**Exfoliation for Smoother Skin:** Many coffee body washes contain exfoliating agents, such as ground coffee beans, that help to remove dead skin cells. This can result in smoother, softer, and more radiant skin. Regular exfoliation can also help to prevent ingrown hairs and improve the absorption of other skincare products.

**Antioxidant Protection:** Coffee is rich in antioxidants, which can help to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can contribute to premature aging, inflammation, and other skin problems. By neutralizing free radicals, antioxidants can help to keep your skin looking healthy and youthful.

**Improved Circulation:** The caffeine in coffee is believed to stimulate blood flow, which can help to improve circulation and reduce the appearance of cellulite. While the effects are likely to be temporary, using a coffee body wash can provide a noticeable boost in skin tone and texture.

**Moisturization and Hydration:** The best coffee body washes are formulated with hydrating ingredients that help to replenish moisture and prevent dryness. This is especially important, as coffee can sometimes have a drying effect on the skin. Look for body washes that contain ingredients like shea butter, hyaluronic acid, or natural oils to keep your skin feeling soft and supple.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions regarding the use, benefits, and safety of coffee body washes. Here are some common questions and answers.

**Can coffee body wash help with cellulite?**
    While coffee body washes are often marketed as a cellulite treatment, the evidence supporting this claim is limited. Caffeine can temporarily improve circulation and reduce the appearance of cellulite, but the effects are not permanent. Consistent use, combined with a healthy lifestyle, may yield some noticeable improvements over time.

**Is coffee body wash suitable for sensitive skin?**
    It depends on the specific formulation. If you have sensitive skin, look for coffee body washes that are free of harsh sulfates, parabens, and artificial fragrances. Choose a product with gentle exfoliating agents and hydrating ingredients. Always test a small area of skin before using the body wash all over.

**How often should I use coffee body wash?**
    The frequency of use depends on your skin type and the aggressiveness of the exfoliant. If you have dry or sensitive skin, you may want to use it only a few times a week. If you have oily or normal skin, you may be able to use it daily. Pay attention to how your skin feels and adjust accordingly.

**Does coffee body wash stain the skin?**
    No, coffee body wash should not stain the skin. The coffee extract is typically present in a low enough concentration that it will not leave a noticeable tint. However, it's always a good idea to rinse thoroughly after using the body wash to ensure that all residue is removed.

 ## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

Whether it be someone new, someone we have known forever or an internet stranger...are the words we use an honest reflection of what we really feel, something we fabricate to keep ourselves and that person invested, or a combination of the two?

I like to think I am an honest person, sometimes to a fault.  I don't hide my views, my flaws, or my flirtatious and playful nature...but wonder how much of it is really viewed as who I am...or a persona I push out to hide the deepest parts of who I am...and work to protect.

Ok, that's enough rambling into the void...I will just continue listening to some good music, drink my coffee and prepare myself for another workday...and interactions with more people...and wonder...are we all who we say we are...",1,1745333501.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

* The Grove is a forest located in the northern part of Krakoa Island, where the main landmark is the Quiet Council chamber.

**The Quiet Council** 

The Quiet Council is Krakoa's main governing body and supreme court, responsible for discussing state affairs and trying criminals. The Council consists of 12 members divided into 4 seats representing the seasons - Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter - with 3 positions in each seat: 

* The Spring seat belongs to Hellfire Trading Company, with past members including White Queen, Black King, and Red Queen. 
* The Summer seat belongs to moderate members of mutant society, mainly held by X-Men members, including Storm, Nightcrawler, Jean Grey, and Colossus. 
* The Autumn seat is held by major mutant leaders, with past members including Professor X, Magneto, Apocalypse, Destiny, and Hope. 
* The Winter seat is held by radical mutants, with past members including Mystique, Mister Sinister, Exodus, and Black Queen. The living island of Krakoa itself is also part of the Quiet Council, with the mutant Cypher serving as its translator and spokesperson.

**The map features statues of four council members:** 

Storm, Magneto, Professor X, and White Queen. In the Marvel Rivals universe, Emma belongs to the Winter seat. The landscapes behind the statues of Storm, Magneto, and White Queen correspond to their respective seats.

At the base of Professor X's statue lies the ""Voltus Glade,"" also known as the Sanctus Sacrum, which is the teleportation circle created from Rockslide's remains in X-Factor V4 #4.

**Akademos Habitat**

The Akademos Habitat, also known as the Sextant, refers to 6 major habitats and surrounding structures located in northern Krakoa. This area serves as both residence and educational facility for different generations of young mutants. Alpha Habitat belongs to the New Mutants; Beta Habitat to the students of Frost Academy (the Hellions); Delta Habitat to Generation X; Omega Habitat to the Mutant Liberation Front; Sigma Habitat to students from the Wolf School era; and Zeta Habitat to students from the New X-Men era.

**Psylocke and Magik's Rooms** 

The respawn rooms on both sides of the map are Psylocke and Magiks’ rooms. Psylocke’s room has a distinctive Japanese style, with her pet wolf ""Logan"" lying on the bed. According to Squirrel Girl's biography, ""Logan"" spent hundreds of years searching for his owner across different timelines before finally passing away on Krakoa. Emma used Krakoa's resurrection protocols to bring ""Logan"" back to life, reuniting him with Psylocke. Magik’s room contains many demon imps from the Limbo realm, and the equipment on the table might be the coffee distiller that appeared in New Mutants V4 #1.",20,1745333457.0,marvelrivals,3,1.0,False

“…no sign of the body…” 

“…no official Avengers roster 

since—” 

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM – DAY 

A civics teacher stands in front of a flickering screen. The slide reads: 

""THE SOKOVIA ACCORDS: REPEALED OR REWRITTEN?"" 

Students barely pay attention. One slouches with earbuds in. Another scrolls her phone. 

STUDENT 

So... like... what happens if 

someone with laser eyes 

blows up a building now? 

TEACHER 

The Global Repatriation Council is 

working on updated legislation. 

A pause. 

STUDENT #2 

What happened to the Avengers? 

The teacher falters. 

The screen shifts to a faded image of the original team. Natasha. Wanda. Bruce. Clint. Tony. Vision. Steve. Static ripples across their faces. 

EXT. BARTON FAMILY FARM – EARLY MORNING 

The world is quiet. 

The Barton home glows warm, filled with the smell of breakfast and the sound of laughter. 

LILA and COOPER argue playfully at the kitchen table.

LAURA kisses CLINT on the cheek, smiling. CLINT watches them, coffee in hand. 

But… he’s not there. 

EXT. MEXICO CITY - DAY (FLASHBACK) 

RONIN STANDS OVER A CORPSE, CHEST HEAVING. Blood streaks across his blade. 

INT. BARTON FAMILY FARM (BACK TO PRESENT) Clint blinks. Hard. 

Shakes it off. 

LAURA sees it. She knows that look. 

LAURA 

(gently, knowing) 

Hey. Where’d you go? 

Clint forces a small smile. 

EXT. VORMIR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 

The wind howls. 

A violet sky, vast and empty. 

NATASHA clings to the cliff’s edge—her hand locked in Clint’s. 

Her face is calm. Her voice, firm. 

Let me go. 

Clint grips tighter. 

NATASHA 

He shakes his head, barely breathing. 

CLINT 

(a whisper, broken) 

I can’t.

Natasha smiles—just a little. 

And then… her legs kick off the cliff wall, 

creating enough force to shake his grip loose. 

INT. KITCHEN - DAY (BACK TO PRESENT) 

Clint’s coffee cup trembles in his hand. 

He sets it down. 

Eyes locked on nothing. 

The sound of laughter fades behind him. 

Clint stands. 

Walks away from the table. 

Laura watches him go. 

She says nothing. 

INT. VISION’S ROOM – NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 

The room is quiet. Too quiet. 

Only the soft pacing of Vision—gliding across the floor in deliberate steps. 

Hands clasped behind his back. Posture perfect. But his shoulders are tight. His jaw clenched. The synthetic jewel in his forehead flickers—nervous energy. A single screen floats beside him. 

Equations shift and reconfigure: quantum loop theories, entropy paradoxes. 

He stares, but his eyes are somewhere else. 

VISION 

If particle spin could destabilize 

probability long enough to 

recalibrate phase transitions, 

perhaps— 

He stops.

Mid-thought. 

Her face flashes behind his eyes. 

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY (FLASHBACK) 

WANDA laughing. 

Bathed in golden kitchen light. 

Hair falling across her eyes—she brushes it back. An oversized sweater slips off her shoulder. 

INT. VISION’S ROOM - NIGHT (BACK TO PRESENT) 

He turns away sharply, like he can physically outrun the memory. 

The screen reshapes—layering on another theory. More complexity. More noise. 

But the thoughts keep coming. 

Wanda, leaning over the sink. 

Her sleeves rolled up. 

The sound of her voice saying his name in that unguarded, low tone. 

The thought of— kissing her. 

He closes his eyes. 

Inhales. 

VISION 

It is illogical. It is… intrusive. 

It is— 

He stops again. 

His hand drifts to his chest. 

Where a heartbeat should live. 

He doesn’t understand it. Not fully. 

But when he thinks of her…

There’s a pull. 

A yearning. 

Something beyond data. 

Beyond circuitry. 

Something human. 

He sits on the edge of his bed. 

The glow of unsolved equations flickers beside him. But all he can see is the way Wanda looked at him earlier— Not like a machine. 

But like a man. 

VISION (CONT’D) 

I wish to comfort her. 

To understand her pain. 

But I also… 

I wish to hold her. 

He opens his eyes—soft, wide. 

VISION (CONT’D) 

I wish… to be held in return. 

The screen fades to black. 

He lets it. 

Because tonight, no equation will soothe the ache in his chest. 

Only she could do that. 

And maybe tomorrow— 

He’ll try. 

He’ll make her chicken paprikash. 

But tonight— 

He sits in the quiet. 

Longing for a girl with chaos in her bones, and kindness in her smile.

EXT. FOREST CLEARING – EARLY MORNING (BACK TO PRESENT) 

Mist clings to the trees. The earth is still. Somewhere in the woods, a figure stirs. 

WANDA lies in the dirt—disoriented, trembling, alive. Her fingers are blackened, her body weak. 

She blinks up at the sky—confused. Empty. 

She doesn’t remember who she is. 

She doesn’t remember her magic. 

She only knows: something inside her is broken. She pushes herself up. 

Staggers to her feet. 

Nearby, a shallow river. 

She catches her reflection in the water— 

But doesn’t recognize it. 

Her fingers instinctively twitch. 

A faint flicker of red—then nothing. 

FLASHES – QUICK CUTS 

— A bomb explodes in Sokovia. 

— VISION’S lifeless body. 

— Screams echo through Kamar-Taj. 

— Chaos. Fire. Loss. 

Wanda clutches her head. 

She drops to her knees — gasping. 

She doesn’t understand what’s happening. 

She can’t tell her dreams from reality anymore. She’s also not alone.

ANGLE ON – THE TREETOPS ABOVE 

Eyes. Watching. Hovering. 

A SHADOWED FIGURE floats just beneath the canopy — the DARKHOLD WITCH. 

Twisted. Ethereal. She shimmers like a broken mirror, a wraith spun from the last dark threads of the Darkhold — a fragment of what was left behind when Mount Wundagore fell. 

She doesn’t breathe. She doesn’t blink. 

She only watches. 

This is not a ghost. This is something more insidious given form.

**ACT II: THE FRACTURE** 

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND – NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 

Soft light flickers from the screen—blues and grays washing over the room. 

WANDA is curled up on the couch. Blanket cocoon. Eyes glassy—not from the movie. 

The Notebook plays softly. Rain. Kissing. Heartbreak. Background noise to the storm she’s holding in. A gentle knock on the doorframe. 

She looks up. 

VISION stands there. 

Arms at his sides. Slightly awkward. Almost… shy. 

VISION 

Forgive the interruption. I… found 

Euler’s conjecture unexpectedly 

complex tonight. I wondered if you— 

—might like some company. 

Wanda blinks. 

Euler’s conjecture? 

Her heart does something it shouldn’t. 

She pats the cushion beside her. 

WANDA 

Sure. Unless you’re worried Ryan 

Gosling’s emotional arc will prove 

equally… complex. 

A soft hum escapes Vision. Not quite a laugh. More like relieved amusement. 

He enters. 

Pauses. 

Looks at her.

Looks at the couch. 

Then—sits. 

Tentative. Upright. Respectful. 

Like she’s royalty. 

Wanda shifts. Tries to refocus on the movie. Fails. 

Her pulse is loud. 

NATASHA walks past the open door. Stops. 

She glances at the two of them—too close to be casual, too stiff to be comfortable. 

Raises an eyebrow. 

(dry) 

“Huh.” 

NATASHA 

She smirks. Walks away. 

Wanda stifles a laugh. 

Vision stares forward like the screen might swallow him. Time passes. 

Scene after scene—they drift. 

Inch by inch. 

Shoulders almost touch. Then— 

They do. 

Wanda leans in, barely. 

She feels him. Warm. 

Too warm for synthetic parts. 

WANDA 

Your circuits must be freezing. 

beat 

Come on… get under the blanket.

Vision looks at the blanket like it’s radioactive. 

VISION 

I… am not certain I can feel cold 

in the traditional sense, but— 

But? 

He looks at her. Really looks. Her smile. 

Her eyes. 

WANDA 

The way her voice softens when she’s teasing him. 

VISION 

Perhaps… I could benefit from a 

degree of warmth. 

He pulls the blanket over them. 

Their shoulders touch. 

Then thighs. 

Then— nothing else exists. 



He catches the scent of her hair. 

She glances at his lips. 



The movie hits that scene. 

Rain. Desperation. The lovers collide—devouring each other. Suddenly— 

Wanda and Vision aren’t watching the movie. 

The movie is watching them. 

!

She leans against him now. 

Head on his shoulder. Body relaxed. 

Her neckline shifts under the blanket. Her skin, pink and glowing in the light. Vision doesn’t turn his head. 

But he knows. 

He shifts in his seat. 

Reaches for a nearby pillow. 

Quick. Strategic. 

But not quick enough. 

Wanda notices. 

She says nothing. 

Just keeps breathing. 

Vision feels each breath like it’s his own. Sees her collarbone rise and fall. 

The flutter in her throat. 

The pulse that jumps when his arm brushes hers. 

Her fingers graze his knee beneath the blanket. 

Vision stares at the screen like a lifeline. But his processors are failing him. 

They stay like that. 

No words. 

Because the spell might break. 

And neither is ready for that. 

The movie ends.

Credits roll in soft piano and rain. The room is silver and shadow. Still. Electric. 

His arm — now behind her on the couch. Not touching. 



Wanda blinks slowly. 

She’s not watching the screen. She turns slightly. 

Looks up. 

He’s already looking at her. 

(soft) 

WANDA 

You stayed. 

VISION 

I didn’t want to go. 

The air, thick. Charged. 

Like a wire pulled tight. 

WANDA 

You never said if the conjecture got any easier. 

VISION 

It did not. 

He blinks once. Then again. 

Wanda… 

VISION 

Her name leaves him like a prayer. Something shatters in his expression. Fear. 

Reverence.

Wanda shifts closer. 

With purpose. 

Her fingers trail down his arm. Find his hand. 

WANDA 

I don’t know what this is yet. 

Nor do I. 

VISION 

She leans against him again. 

He lets his head rest in return. 

Lets his fingers tighten around hers. 

And in that hush— they sit. 

Not as witch and android. 

Not as weapon and machine. 

But as two souls choosing each other. 

EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - DAY (BACK TO PRESENT) 

WANDA walks through the forest—but her reality fractures with each step. 

WHISPERS creep in. 

The Darkhold Witch’s voice. Distant. Whispering from nowhere—and everywhere. 



INT. ILLUMINATI HALL – NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 

Blood-slicked marble floors. 

Slaughter. 

Illuminati corpses lie twisted and broken. 

— PROFESSOR X, neck snapped. 

— MARIA RAMBEAU, crushed beneath debris.

— CAPTAIN CARTER, her own shield cleaving through her torso. WANDA gasps. Her hands tremble. 

The Darkhold Witch sees Wanda from the corner of her eye. She cocks her head at her. Grins. 

DARKHOLD WITCH 

You’re next. 

EXT. FOREST – NIGHT (BACK TO PRESENT) 

Wanda stumbles, falling to her knees. 

She presses her palms into the dirt, trying to ground herself. 

Her breath catches in her throat— 

A scream, primal and raw, rips out of her. 

But the woods offer no echo. 

They swallow her pain in silence. 

EXT. KAMAR-TAJ IN RUINS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 

Sorcerers burned alive. 

Apprentices crushed beneath falling stone. 

Shields raised in vain. 

Darkhold Witch walks beside her now—silent, graceful, unavoidable. 

DARKHOLD WITCH 

This is who you are. 

The Scarlet Witch. 

The real one. 

Wanda collapses to her knees again, her hands shaking violently. 

WANDA 

(whispers) 

This isn’t who I am... 

Her eyes well up—but she does not cry.

EXT. FOREST – NIGHT FALLS (BACK TO PRESENT) 

Wanda huddles near the riverbank. 

Alone. Hollowed out. 

A flicker of red dances across her fingertips—unbidden. Instinctual. 

The Darkhold Witch hovers at the edge of the clearing. Watching. 

But something escapes her piercing gaze. Beneath Wanda’s human frailty lies a faint pulse. 

A still-living ember of Chaos Magic— 

Not twisted. Not corrupted. 

Dormant. 

Waiting. 

The magic flickers again. 

This time, Wanda doesn’t flinch. 

She watches it. 

Almost like it’s learning her mind. 

INT. BARTON FAMILY HOME – EARLY EVENING 

Warm, peaceful. Life moves on, unaware of what’s unfolding in Westview. 

LILA BARTON lounges on the couch, watching TV. 

The screen flickers—bright colors, a laugh track. 

ON TV – 

WANDA, wrapped in a blanket. 

WANDA 

I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m fine. 

CLINT walks in, distracted. A full laundry basket in his hand. Just passing through.

LILA 

(grinning, casual) 

Dad, did you know Avengers get 

their own TV shows now? 

CLINT 

(barely looking up) 

What? 

He glances at the screen. 

Then—he sees it. 

He stops. Just for a second. 

His expression barely changes, but his eyes… shift. 

ON TV – 

WANDA stares straight into the camera. 

WANDA 

The world is just feeling a little… 

meaningless. 

The laugh track plays. 

It feels wrong. 

Clint exhales. 

Clenches his jaw — just slightly. 

EXT. FOREST – NIGHT 

Wanda sleeps curled beside the riverbank. Dirt still streaks her face. Fingers twitch with dream flickers. 

A pulse of red moves under her skin—barely visible. 

INT. KITCHEN – NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 

Low light. The hum of the fridge. 

A quiet simmer on the stove. 

WANDA stirs paprikash in a small pan.

Bare feet cold against the tile. 

VISION stands across from her, leaning on the island. She’s wearing one of his old shirts again. It’s undoing him. 

VISION 

You didn’t have to cook. 

WANDA 

(stirring, not looking at 

him) 

I wanted to. You said you liked how 

it smelled. 

VISION 

I remember. 

He steps forward. Measured. 

Stops just behind her. 

VISION (CONT'D) 

I remember everything you do. 

Wanda stills. 

Then — slowly — she turns. Spoon in hand. The pot bubbles behind her. Neither moves. She leans against the counter. 

Drops the spoon into the sink. 

WANDA 

You should say what you’re 

thinking. 

VISION 

I’m calculating the distance 

between us. 

The weight of what I want. 

The risk of ruining everything. 

And?

WANDA 

VISION 

My calculations are incomplete. 

She breathes in. 

Then — pushes herself up onto the counter. Legs part. 

Just enough. 

The hem of the shirt rides up her thighs. She meets his eyes. 

WANDA 

Then let me help. 

A pause. 

Heavy. Sacred. 

Vision steps closer. 

Stands between her knees. 

VISION 

I’ve never… 

I know. 

She lifts his hand. 

WANDA 

Places it on her thigh. 

His body reacts like it’s remembering something it never learned. 

WANDA (CONT’D) 

It doesn’t have to be perfect. 

VISION 

I don’t want perfect. 

I want real. 

Their lips meet. 

Not with hunger. 

With fear. 

The kind of kiss that quiets the entire universe.

His hands slide slowly up her thighs—hesitant, reverent. He melts. 

The kiss deepens—earned, slow, devastating. 

She pulls him closer by the collar. 

Her legs wrap loosely around his waist. 

The pot on the stove hisses louder. 

They don’t hear it. 

Because right now—there’s nothing else. 

Just this. 

Her breath in his mouth. 

His hands beneath the shirt. 

She gasps— 

A flicker. 

Scarlet magic dances across her fingertips. 

The jewel in his forehead glows—syncing to her pulse. But neither breaks the kiss. 

WANDA 

Don’t stop. 

VISION 

I never will. 

INT. DREAMSPACE – SAME KITCHEN – NIGHT (PRESENT DAY) The light is gone. 

Everything is still. 

Stacked plates. Clean pots. Blank TV screen. 

Vision gone. 

Only THE DARKHOLD WITCH remains — standing where Vision stood just moments ago.

DARKHOLD WITCH 

You remember now, don’t you? 

WANDA 

(dazed) 

Vision… 

DARKHOLD WITCH 

Yes… Vision. He was real. And so 

were your boys… 

^(beat)You made them real. 

Wanda doesn’t speak. Her lip trembles. 

DARKHOLD WITCH 

Do you remember who took them away? It wasn’t Thanos. 

Stephen... 

WANDA 

DARKHOLD WITCH 

That’s right… The Supreme Sorcerer. The exceptional genius. Incompetent in the end. 

He saw what would happen. 

And he let it happen anyway. 

DARKHOLD WITCH (CONT’D) 

They took Vision’s body, remember? Disassembled him. Piece by piece. 

WANDA 

They were... trying to stop me. 

DARKHOLD WITCH 

They were trying to control you. (closer) 

Where were the Avengers when you needed them? 

Not one of them came to grieve with you.

DARKHOLD WITCH (CONT’D) 

Not after Vision. 

Not after Westview. 

(beat) 

They let you *drown*. 

Wanda’s hands tremble. The kitchen warps—cracks crawling across the floor tiles. 

WANDA 

I tried to fix it. 

DARKHOLD WITCH 

And they called you a threat. 

WANDA 

I just wanted them back. 

DARKHOLD WITCH 

You still do. 

Let me help you fix things. 

Wanda says nothing. 

The Witch leans forward. 

DARKHOLD WITCH (CONT’D) 

They forgot you. 

But I didn’t. 

INT. FOREST – NIGHT 

Wanda bolts upright, gasping. 

Sweat glistens on her forehead. Her eyes flicker red. She looks around—panicked. Disoriented. 

The dream still clings to her skin. 

From the trees— 

The Darkhold Witch watches. 

Smiling. 

EXT. VANISHED MEMORIAL – LATE AFTERNOON 

The golden hour casts long shadows across the engraved stones.

Families pass through quietly. Mourners. Survivors. 

CLINT BARTON walks slowly with LILA and COOPER, pointing out names. He’s calm, present—for them. 

But his eyes keep drifting toward a quiet spot beneath the trees. 

A little off the path… 

A STATUE OF NATASHA ROMANOFF. 

Solid. Still. Her face sculpted mid-thought—between kindness and resolve. 

In front of her stands BRUCE BANNER, alone. 

Hands in his coat pockets. Shoulders slightly hunched. He’s been standing there a while. 

Clint gives a quiet nod to his kids. 

They stay behind. 

He approaches. 

CLINT 

Didn’t expect to see you. 

BRUCE 

Didn’t expect to come. 

They stand together, side by side. Looking up at her. 

CLINT 

They did a decent job with the 

face. 

Not quite her eyes, though. 

BRUCE 

No statue ever gets the eyes right. 

A long silence. 

Birds chirp faintly in the trees. Life keeps happening. 

CLINT 

Kids ask about her sometimes. 

What she was like. Why there’s not 

more about her.

Bruce says nothing. 

CLINT (CONT’D) 

Feels like the world moved on… 

but we didn’t. 

Bruce finally speaks. Quiet. Measured. 

BRUCE 

I’ve tried to. 

And? 

CLINT 

A pause. Bruce’s jaw tightens. 

BRUCE 

Some days I think I’ve made peace 

with it. 

Other days, I’m not so sure I even 

believe she’s gone. 

He exhales, slow. Controlled. 

CLINT 

She made her choice. 

Bruce nods. Once. 

BRUCE 

She always did. 

Another beat. 

CLINT 

Alright. I should get back. 

Bruce doesn’t move. Doesn’t look at him. 

Clint lingers—maybe wanting to say more. But he doesn’t. He gives a soft nod and walks away, back toward his family. 

WIDE SHOT – BRUCE STANDING ALONE 

Natasha’s statue behind him. Wind brushing past the trees.

He stares forward. Still. Silent. 

Then— 

His lips move. Just barely. We don’t hear what he says. Could be a name. Could be nothing at all. 

INT. CLINT BARTON’S HOME – NIGHT 

The TV flickers. Static… then news coverage. 

A live aerial shot shows the red-tinged dome hovering above a small town. 

REPORTER 

…unknown phenomena centered around 

a small New Jersey community—again. 

Sources confirm there are no 

civilians inside… 

Clint sits on the couch, silent. A half-drunk bottle of beer in his hand. 

Lila enters behind him, concerned.   
  


Dad? 

LILA 

He doesn’t answer. Just stares. 

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING – NIGHT 

Rain pours outside, battering the broken windows. Thunder rumbles. 

The interior is a maze of concrete and shadow—graffiti, crates, flickering lights. 

Footsteps ECHO down a stairwell. 

CLINT BARTON — cloaked in black, mask down, katana in hand — moves like a ghost. 

A predator. Efficient. Cold. 

INT. LOWER LEVEL – CONTINUOUS 

A group of YAKUZA OPERATIVES plays cards under a bare hanging bulb. Weapons close. Laughing. Unaware.

Until— 

SLICK—SLASH—SILENCE. 

The first man drops, throat opened before he even sees Clint. 

Another reaches for a gun—CLINT throws a blade, embedding it in his shoulder. He screams. 

Confusion erupts. 

Three men rush him. 

A brutal dance: 

• Clint flips the table into one attacker. 

• Spins, slashes, disarms a second. 

• Shoves the third against a pillar, blade to throat. 

MAN 

Wait—wait! We’re just dealers, we 

didn’t— 

He drives the blade in. 

Blood splashes across the wall. Clint breathes hard—too hard. He’s trembling. 

INT. STAIRWELL – MOMENTS LATER 

He climbs in silence. 

Thunder CRACKS. His boots echo in blood and water. His phone buzzes. 

He stops. Stares at the number on the screen. Picks up. 

NATASHA 

Where are you? 

A pause. 

His jaw tightens. 

CLINT 

Hawkeye is dead, Natasha.

He ends the call. 

Drops the phone. 

It lands in a puddle. 

He stares into his reflection—distorted. A stranger. Thunder crashes again. 

Then— 

He disappears into the night. 



INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE – LATE MORNING 

Muted light. A clock ticks softly. 

CLINT BARTON sits in the chair like it might punch him. Hood still up. Eyes unreadable. 

Across from him, the THERAPIST. No notepad. Just watching. 

THERAPIST 

You know, you can take your coat 

off. 

I know. 

CLINT 

THERAPIST 

You came back. Voluntarily this time. 

CLINT 

Didn’t say voluntarily. 

Laura? 

He nods. That’s all. 

THERAPIST 

THERAPIST (CONT’D) 

Does your family know what you’re carrying?

CLINT 

Some of it. 

Long silence. 

THERAPIST 

How about others? Do you have a 

support network? People to talk to in your life? 

CLINT 

Kind of. My best friend. 

Effective? 

THERAPIST CLINT 

Eh. She died. So... jury’s out. 

THERAPIST 

And how are you coping with the loss? 

CLINT 

Well I mean... 

I sleep with a weapon under the mattress. I do perimeter checks when the dog barks. Sometimes I forget I have a dog. 

THERAPIST 

But you haven’t hurt anyone. 

Yet. 

CLINT 

THERAPIST 

Have you wanted to? 

CLINT 

No. Just... remembering how easy it was. For Ronin. 

The therapist leans forward slightly. Quiet.

THERAPIST 

And for Clint? 

Clint swallows. Doesn’t answer. 

EXT. HEX PERIMETER – NIGHT 

A dense red shimmer pulses across the tree line. The air is wrong—too still, too charged. It hums, low and alive. 

S.W.O.R.D. drones hover overhead, scanning, glitching, failing. 

JIMMY WOO stands beside a folding operations table. A digital display warps—barely containing the energy signature. 

The conference room was clearly prepped to accommodate more people. 

But across from him stood two crisis responders: MONICA RAMBEAU and AMERICA CHAVEZ. 

JIMMY 

This is the fourth energy spike in 

two hours. 

Strongest at the forest epicenter 

just bordering Westview. 

AMERICA 

The barrier’s expanding. 

MONICA 

No—it’s breathing. 

She stares at it. 

MONICA (CONT’D) 

Like it’s aware. 

A low pulse ripples across the 

field—almost like a heartbeat. 

JIMMY 

You still want to try this? 

AMERICA 

We won’t get another opening like 

this.

MONICA 

If there’s any part of her still in 

there... 

maybe she’ll let us through. 

JIMMY 

Just don’t push it. She’s not doing 

this on purpose— 

but that doesn’t make her less 

dangerous. 

America steps forward. Monica follows. 

AMERICA 

Let’s test the welcome mat. 

She raises a glowing fist. Energy ripples in a star-shaped pattern. She punches— 

BOOM. 

The star portal forms—briefly— 

Then the Hex swallows it whole. 

The air slams shut with a sickening THUMP. 

Monica exhales. 

MONICA 

It’s rejecting her. 

America shakes her hand out, frustrated. 

AMERICA 

That’s new. 

Or old. beat 

MONICA 

She remembers me. 

America steps back. Monica steps forward—tentative. She raises one hand toward the barrier. The Hex reacts—

A wave of red energy lashes out instinctively. Monica braces, body glowing with light— 

ZAP. 

She’s knocked backward twenty feet, tumbling through grass. America runs to her. 

Monica! 

AMERICA 

Monica sits up, dazed but conscious. Her body hums with residual static. 

I’m fine. You flew. 

MONICA AMERICA MONICA 

No. I was thrown. 

They both turn toward the Hex—still rippling, like it's alive and hurting. 

MONICA (CONT’D) 

You wanna try the portal thing 

again? 

AMERICA 

I’ve already tried five times. It’s 

like… she’s cutting me off from 

myself… and I don’t know what that 

means yet. 

MONICA 

Powers, tech — none of it works 

inside. 

It’s another Hex. 

AMERICA 

But she doesn’t even know she’s 

doing it. 

She looks up at the Hex. It shimmers darker now, like it’s closing ranks. 

MONICA 

She doesn’t want heroes.

AMERICA 

She doesn’t want help. 

MONICA 

No...She doesn’t want to be 

reminded. 

EXT. HEX PERIMETER – NIGHT 

A long stretch of trees. Quiet. Red energy pulses faintly in the distance—alive, wounded. 

AMERICA CHAVEZ sits on a rock near the tree line, legs dangling. Tired. Frustrated. Alone, but not avoiding anyone. 

MONICA RAMBEAU approaches from behind, a thermal jacket draped around her shoulders. She doesn’t speak—just sits beside her. 

A long silence. 

AMERICA 

You ever feel like powers show up 

just to ruin everything? 

No. 

beat Yes. 

Same. 

MONICA AMERICA 

The Hex pulses again in the distance—like it’s breathing. 

MONICA 

You ever feel like if you stop 

moving, 

the grief catches up? 

AMERICA 

I tried standing still once. 

Opened a portal to a world where my 

moms never died.

And? 

MONICA AMERICA 

Didn’t go in. 

Why not? 

MONICA AMERICA 

Thought it might be worse. 

MONICA nods. No judgment. No advice. Just… understanding. 

Yeah. Same. 

MONICA 

They sit in that truth. It's not warm, but it’s real. A moment. 

MONICA extends a fist. No pressure. No ceremony. AMERICA looks at it. Then bumps it. 

They don’t smile. 

They just *are*. 

WIDE PAN LEFT — SLOW, SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE Revealing JIMMY WOO. 

Sitting **completely still**.

Our talks are mostly lighthearted so nothing toooo deep and personal, but we have a lot of fun joking around together and he will often ask me to grab coffee in the midday. He often offers to help me out when I am struggling which I am super thankful for. But lately I've been noticing that we've been having a lot of ""accidental"" touches or he's been in my personal space a lot? Like brushing against each other when walking, or him leaning rather closely when we're chatting at my desk, or him placing his hand over mine when trying to show me something on my screen? these got me seriously thinking because when the first few accidental touches happened I thought it was definitely unintentional, but it has happened more than a few times now so I don't know if this is some body language indication of attraction or if I'm going crazy.

I tried the bag in the morning and for the first few sips I couldn't taste neither the chocolate not the nutty flavor as advertised, but while drinking the last half of the  cup I felt some kind of flavour not exactly chocolaty and nutty but something which felt diffrent from my usual bru and Nescafe instant cofee. And the caffeine hit was definitely noticeble

After around 5 hours  I tried the drip machine and filled it  upto 2.3 on the scale and put around 1.5 spoon of blue tokai viena roast in the filter. Once the pot was filled with cofee I checked the filter and there was still some cofee filtered water left in the the filter so I added that to the pot as well. After drinking it felt like maybe I put too much water or maybe the amount of coffee was not adequate, still when I was drinking it it felt like  this weirdly diluted but still bitter coffee. There was no froth either and there was nothing particularly distinguishing or unique in terms of taste. Oh and there was some sludge at the bottom of the cup. Maybe I am expecting too much from this 1500 rupees machine.

Just an hour later I tried the v60 cup and used 1 spoon of the same blue tokai viena roast and 120 ml of water and this one actually felt like some kind of upgrade from the instant cofee. It felt smooth and still strong at the same time. I still expect some kind of thickness or texture which people claim can only be tasted in the ground coffee. The flipside is that there was no caffeine 'kick' this time. Maybe I will add milk next time while increasing the quatinty of coffee even more. 

Lastly I will say that I have drink green tea and I definitely feel the diffrence in taste when I immerse the tea bags in the water for longer duration and also feel that thick texture which I am yet to experience with ground coffee. In terms of coffee what I am looking for is that feeling when you are at a wedding and it's 2 am and both you and your cousin get the cofee in small paper cups and first it feels too hot and then your tounge and mouth adjust to the temperature and then you starts to enjoy it and before you know it's the last sip and  and you gulp it down in one motion and immediately want another cup. But no one is at the counter and you have nothing but the feeling of that last sip.
 
I have also ordered a cheap moka pot and maybe that
will be different.

I sincerely hope that one of you can help me with this. Now to the problem, but I have to go into a little more detail as I think it is relevant to the diagnosis.

(This post ist translated from German into English)

Almost eleven years ago, half a year after graduating from high school, when I was applying for universities and leading a relatively unhealthy life (with lots of coffee, little sleep, lots of partying, working late into the night, etc.), I suddenly had severe flashbacks out of nowhere with images from my childhood of bullying, my mother's cruelty towards me, bad experiences, etc., which ultimately resulted in severe panic attacks with extreme trembling, inner nervousness and a strong feeling of anxiety in my chest, which were absolutely unbearable and even strong sedatives like Tavor had no effect. These panic attacks and extreme anxiety lasted for weeks and months without ever subsiding. I was completely desperate, nothing could calm my body down. At some point, a terrible obsessive thought came along. But it wasn't a typical obsessive thought with obscene content or anything like that. No, it was more like a thought without content, but one that I always had to remember. Every second of my existence. I thought about what exactly it was for a long time, but never figured it out. It was a combination of a fearful thought and a feeling. It was like an endless loop in my brain that poured out a lot of fear. At some point I hallucinated faintly, i.e. I saw colorful reflections of light on the white wall, as well as walls coming closer and felt unreal while walking. I couldn't eat any more, became severely underweight in a short time and was completely beside myself. But what bothered me most was this obsessive thought, as it was really there every second and I was absolutely unable to free myself from it or distract myself from it. The end of the story was that I was then admitted to a district hospital and spent three quarters of a year there with no prospect of recovery. I really thought I was going to die, it was the worst time of my life so far. I had no strength left, I was just trapped in my head. I woke up with panic attacks and went to bed with panic attacks. The doctors there diagnosed me with all sorts of illnesses, which they eventually reversed. Everything from generalized anxiety disorder to psychosis was included. However, they were never able to make an exact diagnosis. The medication was also changed on a weekly basis. Starting with Zyprexa, then Seroquel, then various antidepressants and so on. Nothing helped. Some made me more tired than others, others made my eyes flicker and I saw flashes of light. In the end, none of them helped. Sometime in March 2015, after three quarters of a year in hospital, my condition slowly improved and I was discharged from hospital. The obsessive thoughts continued to haunt me for longer and restlessness kept coming through here and there. I finally overcame the obsessive thoughts by taking driving lessons. I signed up for a driving license and was able to gradually let the obsessive thoughts fade into the background by paying extreme attention to the traffic. Initially only for a few seconds, then eventually for minutes and finally hours and days. Within a few months, I had my old life back. I was once again a happy young woman with a great zest for life and lived my life as if nothing had ever happened. 

I had a wonderful life for almost eleven years, never truly forgot that time of horror, but was completely normal and always said that beating this disease was the greatest thing I had ever done. What always accompanied me, however, was a certain fear of illness. Health anxiety or a mild hypochondria I would say.

I used to get myself into illnesses when my body showed strange symptoms that I couldn't interpret. But I always managed to get out of it in time before it got worse. Mostly because a doctor reassured me that I was healthy.

I had built a great life for myself in those ten years. I married my boyfriend of many years, we bought a great old house, have a loving dog and I've felt very much at home in my new city for the last two years.

I thought I had achieved everything. Only a child would have completed our happiness. 

Then last year in March I became pregnant. We were so happy and my pregnancy seemed like something out of a picture book. I hardly had any nausea or hair loss. I was spared anything negative. At least I thought so. Visits to the gynaecologist were always nice and I looked forward to every visit. In the middle of my pregnancy, however, my high blood pressure became more and more apparent. However, it was in a range that didn't seem alarming to the gynecologist. The values were in the range of 140:95, sometimes more, sometimes less. I had never had high blood pressure before, so I was a little worried about the possibility of pre-eclampsia. But the doctor never detected any protein in my urine, so I thought I was on the safe side until the end. I had loud ringing in my ears twice, but basically I was mentally and physically fine until the end and I just put it down to the pregnancy. Two days before my due date, I went into labor at night and called my midwife the next morning to see if she could come by. She came in the morning but found that my cervix was not even a centimeter open and asked me to lie down on the couch to have acupuncture needles inserted. I was supposed to relax, but I never did. As soon as I was lying on my back, the midwife pulled out her blood pressure monitor and put it around my arm. The result: 160:110 blood pressure. She said she didn't want to worry me now, but I should go to the hospital immediately as she was sure I had pre-eclampsia. I couldn't believe what she was saying. I had expected to give birth at any time without any problems. Out of nowhere I had the worst panic attack of my life. My eyes just flickered and I was unable to move. I only just managed to remove the needles from my legs and call my husband. I couldn't even get my hospital bag and was unable to walk up the stairs. All I remember was getting into the car and telling my husband that I thought I was having a stroke. There at the hospital, a urine test confirmed the sad truth. I had severe pre-eclampsia with lots of protein and my kidneys were slowly becoming permeable. I found myself bitterly crying and signing the induction form, thinking my life was over and I was going to die. The first night in hospital was terrible, no sleep at all, I suffered from severe headaches and had a totally swollen face with red patches under my eyes and around my nose. The induction was a disaster, it was the worst pain I ever felt. I lasted one day. My waters broke, I was leaking for hours, I was under extreme stress, but my cervix did not open.  At some point I begged the doctor to give me a caesarean section. I just couldn't take any more. She wasn't enthusiastic about my suggestion until the very end, when the next shock finally came. The baby had the umbilical cord around its neck, which caused the heartbeat to drop. I was panicking again. I was so scared of the little one and of getting an injection in my back. It was then quickly decided to do an emergency C-section to save the baby, so the doctors and the anesthetist ran off during their lunch break and prepared me for the operation. I still remember how they put these stockings on me and how I got the injection in my back, full of fear. It was a spinal anesthesia, not an epidural. I remember that the doctor pricked my back several times. Maybe that will be important later. During the operation I was strangely very relaxed and stared at the ceiling while the baby was taken out and jiggled around in my stomach. My husband was present and said that the machine showed a systolic blood pressure of over 200 and was always clicked away by the nurse as an emergency signal. However, I didn't notice any of this. When the little one was brought in for us to see, I was totally happy and exhausted and cried full of joy. I was then taken to the separate room and waited until my legs regained feeling. The first day with the little one was good as far as I can remember. And my blood pressure was  briefly back to 134:80 or something like that. I really thought everything was fine now. However, the worst came later. One day later to be precise. I suddenly had an extreme headache the next day. It hurt endlessly in my neck, forehead and sides and nothing helped. No painkillers, nothing. I had the catheter in from the caesarean section and had an additional load of painkillers as an infusion in my veins. I think there were two different medications. One of them was paracetamol, no idea about the other one. When I tried to sleep, I saw a blue aura with my eyes closed. Like looking through a kaleidoscope. Like being on an acid trip. At first I put it down to being overtired and exhausted. However, my condition got worse and worse. The headaches lasted for four days, I didn't get any sleep because the nurses kept waking me up every two hours to breastfeed the little one. On the second day after the birth, my blood pressure was measured and it was suddenly 180:110. I had a terrible panic attack. I thought it was really over for me now. My blood pressure didn't go down for the next few days either, it got higher and higher and my anxiety got worse and worse. By now I was panicking in front of the blood pressure monitor and I kept asking the nurses and doctors whether I was going to die from it, whether my readings were getting worse, etc.  I could no longer calm down, something was terribly wrong with me. I constantly had a strange feeling in my head. Totally foggy and restless. When I fell asleep, I kept seeing images in front of my eyes and I kept tossing and turning, like a microsleep, without really sleeping. I only became aware of it when my cell phone suddenly fell out of my hand out of nowhere and I was startled awake. I kept seeing these strange images. I had never experienced anything like it and I was incredibly scared. On the fourth day, the whole right side of my face started to hurt. It was really a dull pain around my right eye. Everything was just so tight. My jaw hurt, as did my cheekbone and, to make matters worse, my vision was suddenly completely blurred in my right eye. I was not able to focus anymore and absolutely panicked to the point where the doctors didn't know what was happening to me. My thoughts were racing around blood pressure, pre-eclampsia and death. I just instinctively knew something was wrong with me and begged the doctors to examine me as I could no longer see clearly. They then ordered an MRI and I was taken there in a wheelchair because I could no longer walk properly and suddenly had severe dizziness. Not dizziness where my surroundings were spinning, but I felt as if I was swaying, as if the ground was no longer stable and as if I had absorbent cotton in my head. It was frightening. In the evening I was lying in bed and I went so crazy that I saw the clock and the Jesus cross on the wall jump. I saw everything double and move. I had the feeling that my brain was pulsating, i.e. expanding and contracting. The nurse put a blood pressure machine on my arm and I suddenly saw afterimages of her arm movements. As if the image was still there afterwards. I begged the doctors to take me to the intensive care unit because I really thought I was going to die. That really was the worst moment of me in this hospital. My blood pressure slowly went down over the next few days and was then brought down to 145:90 with Nifetipine at the end. Still far too high, but the nurses tried to reassure me that I wouldn't die of post partum pre-eclampsia now. The vision in my right eye improved again, but it didn't feel the same as before. I was finally discharged 11 days after the birth with Sertraline and Nifetipine as antihypertensives, but my life has not been the same since. Now to my problem. It's now been over four months since the birth and I've had that unbearable anxiety and panic every day since then. The racing thoughts about blood pressure and pre-eclampsia have now turned back into these second-by-second obsessive thoughts/feelings with no content. It's just like it was 11 years ago and I have absolutely no idea how to stop it. But now to the much worse problem. I have had this strange dizziness since giving birth. It's not dizziness where my surroundings are spinning, but I sway all the time, as if I have no feeling in my legs/feet. I am dazed 24/7, have difficulty focusing my eyes, often have a pressure in my head, often between my eyebrows, then sometimes on my scalp, as if my brain is hurting. I can no longer remember anything, have difficulty doing the simplest things. It's as if my brain can no longer keep up. Before all that I was always so active and able to multitask, now I'm happy when I can make my little one a bottle. It's like my brain is only running at 2%. I also have extreme insomnia and often have these images in front of my eyes. It's terrible. Like a nightmare that I can't wake up from. When I go into stores or buildings it's extreme. The drowsiness and the swaying are so terrible. I can no longer follow normal conversations, all I think about is this condition, how I can get rid of it, what it could be, etc. I am so desperate and now suicidal. I used to love life so much and was such a fun-loving, open and social person. Now I can't take it anymore and am just googling symptoms and can't get out of my anxiety and this dizziness. I came across PPPD on the internet and wondered if this could be it. The symptoms are identical to mine. Especially the fact that it gets worse when the environment changes. I can no longer understand the simplest things that require motoric action, such as unfolding the baby carriage, or I can't keep up with the most normal conversations. It feels like I've had a stroke. However, all tests are fine. I have already had two MRIs, blood tests, an EEG and a dizziness test at the ENT doctor. Everything came back with no detectable structural damage. I can't go on living like this, and I want this condition to be gone so much. I want to be there for my child, but even that overwhelms me. The illness and the dizziness take over me 100%. Could this be due to the spinal anesthesia? I have already called an anesthesiologist and told him about my situation. However, he said that other complaints (such as paralysis) would occur with such complications and that he assumed that I had a purely psychological problem in the form of psychosis. However, I have now been in a psychosomatic clinic for 8 weeks and psychosis was ruled out there. I had the panic attacks under control quite well at that time, but the dizziness/drowsiness was extreme and always there. Sometimes I couldn't even pour myself a cup of tea or put a tray in the stand.  As soon as I stand up and walk, the dizziness is extreme and I have to concentrate so much. I don't have this dizziness when I'm in the car or lying down. But it's there as soon as I start walking. If I stop after a long walk, it feels like I'm riding in an elevator. Walking itself feels like getting off a ride. Running is impossible, as soon as I run, I feel like my brain is jumping and bouncing and my eyes start to flicker. I just can't do it anymore. What could it be? Do any of you have experience of this? I don't want to live like this anymore. What could have happened? Has my brain been poisoned with these infusions? Please can someone tell me that this will go away? Thank you in advance.

I need help troubleshooting my Breville Smart Grinder Pro (SGP). 

Every time my machine needs descaling, I also clean the SGP, and have never had problems until recently. One time (\~ 3 cleans ago), I accidentally broke the felt washer that sits underneath the inner burr. I replaced it with a hand-made one (see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2k3WVNfmLE&ab_channel=RobbyC)) the next two times and didn't have problems with the SGP grinding fine enough for espresso. I did start noticing an increase in retention, though. The most recent time I cleaned it, I ordered replacement felt washers from Amazon (non-Breville brand, [link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DY16YMHZ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)). These ""felt"" slightly more foamy than the factory ones, but I was able to lock in the burrs and other parts back in just fine without having to push extra hard. As far as I can tell, ever since this last cleaning, the machine hasn't ground fine enough for espresso. 

Now, every time I pull a shot, I can visibly see that the coffee bed is much more coarse and I'm also getting excessive channeling to a point where it makes a huge mess. I use a bottomless portafilter. 

I have had this grinder only since \~2022 and I barely use it 2-3 a week (max), so I doubt the burrs have worn out. 

Has anyone else experienced this issue with the SGP? I would appreciate any/all advice on what I can try next!! Thank you :) ",1,1745332381.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

But…. This past weekend I went out with my wife and had a Easter
Picture on Saturday and during that time she said something like your really bad at hiding it.
I’m like what are you saying? She said you know what you did. I’m like I don’t actually so please enlighten me. She said never mind I shouldn’t have said anything. Sunday service. Again we are selerated but we are trying to be “cordial” for the baby. During the service it was informal and it was the pastors birthday they had bouncy houses for the kids and bubbles coffee and worship going on. I’m watching my son and laughing and she gets mad at me saying I need to stop your embarrassing us. So I’m like what? My son did something funny and it wasn’t just me laughing it was a whole lot of people. She goes well your too loud. So I shut my mouth and shut down for a while. Then she acts normal twenty minutes later and starts saying sorry. I said no need we are good. Then she goes I’m not your enemy rob. I’m like you say this all the time when you take my joy away. I’m not having this discussion with you now I had the baby in my arms and she takes him and says your energy isn’t good for the baby. Fast forward to lunch. She starts saying the same
Stuff and I told her I don’t want to talk about it now. And she goes, “ I don’t know who treated you the way you were
Treated to react like that with me” I’m like it’s been you. She said it’s not true. I replied not now.
I told you to stop because we are trying to eat and this energy isn’t good for the baby. Fast forward to the car ride home on an empty stomach and no appetite for anything anymore she argued and argued and I exploded in the car…… I feel so bad because I’ve had it. Ive been at my breaking point for a while. I called the police to mitigate the situation because it got to far. I told
The police I’m going to my best friend’s house here in Fayetteville. Long story short I did that and took a pair of work clothes with me some deodorant and a toothbrush. Got to see my old dog that I had to give away because it was the dogs or the baby… anyways. Before the night ends my wife texted me asking me what I told police and what are situation is going to be. I told her I’ll drop the keys off in the morning so you can go to work , then she responded with we need food for the house… I texted her that after work I will go to Costco and get things but I’ll be leaving again to avoid contact or any sort of chance she gets to push buttons that don’t need to be pushed. So I leave and I get up at 345am to drive back to Charlotte to get to my work van and drop off the car keys. The padlock is on the door and I wasn’t able to enter my home and see my son or take him to daycare. So I squeezed the keys and the remote for the garage through the opening of the door and took off. I came back that day around 4. Told her I was going to take our son with me so I could spend time with him. She asked you will bring him back though right? I said Paola what did I tell you I was going to do. I said I’m going to get
Food for the house, which means I have to come back. Yes he will be returned. And it’s not like I would take him to my buddies house and have a child with me id rather him stay with his mom
Right now because the stability
Aspect. Daycare is there and he needs structure in his life. So I took him and I really enjoyed it. I get home bring the groceries down and spend some
More time with him. Then when I put him to bed I tell my wife no need to sit on the couch. I’m going to sleep at my friend Keith’s house which he prepared his spare room for me. So I go and 10pm
Hits I’m going to bed and I get a text from her brother saying he’s at my house. Put it in context I’ve decided to separate and file for divorce months ago. But him and his wife came to my house to talk and my
Wife calls me and asks me if I’m close by…..I’m like no do you need me to come to the house. She goes yes please. Mistake number 1…. I went to the house….. I asked them where their kids were and they were not with them which now leads me to understand this was a set up for us to talk. A lot of things were said and now her family knows. For two years I’ve tried getting her help. For two years I’ve tried getting her therapy and counseling for us. And she never went that route and said “I don’t need it you do” you are the reason this marriage is failing you are useless, you are not a man. You can’t be a good father if you’re a terrible partner. Ladies and gents….. being told
This for two years made me lose the initiative, the drive the motivation to do anything for myself. I am a shell of my former self and I just don’t want her anymore. I love her because she is the mother of my son but I’m not in love with her anymore. I could have just said I’m not coming to the house because she pretended to be calm and all that. And when her brother started sharing his marriage life it was very similar to mine but guys. It’s gotten bad to where I don’t feel safe in the house.
I don’t think it’s safe for the baby or my wife either and we are just two people that aren’t meant to be around each other. We didn’t have much time and everything happened so fast and I thought by marrying her and raising a family was the best decision at the time. I didn’t have great examples of how to be a good husband or a father growing up. I come from a very broken home so I longed for those christmases and thanksgivings etc. but every holiday since being with this person has been a nightmare. I don’t have the drive to get up anymore. Idon’t have the energy to talk,
I’m exhausted. Really really defeated and all I’m trying to do at this point is continue therapy and self care, to continue get professional and legal help. Try to be the best dad I can be….. because in this marriage…. Nothing I have ever done was good enough. And I’m longing to peace and i need that right now.‘I just feel every-time I get a taste of it she somehow finds a way to ruin it…. I don’t know what to do anymore about her.
I don’t want to leave my house because I’m still paying the bills but I also can’t live there anymore.
She isn’t a citizen and doesn’t have family close. She has no where to do so better me right? I wish I could take my son too. But I wouldn’t want my friends to take that responsibility.
That’s tough. I don’t have money to break the lease and move out. It’s a touch situation because I’m done with everything

This inspired me to reflect on the symbolism and to dig deep and I arrived at a resonant interpretation that I wanted to share.

We'll consider the symbolism of the devouring jaws of the wolf, and his uncanny night gaze. We'll look into the symbolism of trickery and even touch on the meaning of the sorcerer and the wizard. And we'll review insights regarding how we can avoid getting trapped in the jaws of the wolf.

# A Quick Recap of the Tale

Let's start with a quick synopsis of the story, as it is a bit more nuanced than we may remember when hearing it as children. This synopsis is from a
[webpage](https://www.colorado.edu/projects/fairy-tales/old-french-fairy-tales/little-red-riding-hood)
maintained by the University of Colorado Boulder.

Red Riding-Hood’s mother asks her to go to her grandmother’s with cakes and butter. She must travel through the woods to get there and while on her way she meets a wolf. The wolf has the desire to eat her but is wary of the woodcutters nearby, so he asks Riding-Hood where she is going. She gives him the details of her grandmother’s house and they part ways. The wolf runs and takes the short route while Red Riding-Hood takes the long route to the house. The wolf arrives at the grandmother’s house first and pretends to be Red Riding-Hood. The grandmother falls for this trick and is eaten in one gulp by the wolf. Later Red Riding-Hood arrives to give her grandmother the gifts and the wolf now dressed as her grandmother lets her in. Red Riding-Hood comments on her grandmother’s big ears, nose, and teeth before she also is eaten by the wolf.

# The Jaws and Penetrating Vision of the Wolf

The wolf has a variety of meanings in symbolism, but many of these relate to the jaws. Jaws symbolize devouring (drawing upon Cirlot and Chevalier). Sometimes this means literal destruction. But often, devouring will instead symbolize the first part of the cycle of transformation. ""Out with the old, in with the new."" We often have to discard an old way of being that wasn't serving us well. This clears the slate so a new way of being that serves us better can take toot. In cases like this, we aren't truly destroyed. Only the part of us that is no longer beneficial perishes, and this makes way for new growth and development.

The large ears and nose of the wolf are emphasized at the end of the tale. And this brings us to another important aspect of wolf symbolism. Wolves have eyes that look pretty otherworldly at night (also drawing upon Cirlot and Chevalier). They seem to really peer at you like they know all your secrets. They can see in the dark. It's almost like they can gaze into our shadows and see everything we want to keep to ourselves. Here, the large ears and nose similarly refer to the wolf's keen perception and his ability to take in information that would seem faint or hidden to the rest of us.

Thus, like the hound, the wolf has an almost uncanny ability to sniff things out. As a psychological allegory, the wolf thus symbolizes someone's ability to reach hidden conclusions that would be too faint or obscure for many of us to bring into conscious awareness. The wolf can thus symbolize someone who is very perceptive, who has a great capability to see what would usually be hidden.

# The Wolf and the Con Man

There is a moral question facing the wolf, that is a person with eagle-eyed perception. When they realize all sorts of things that would be hidden to most, will they use this powerful knowledge for good or for evil?

In ancient times, this was viewed as the difference between a wizard and a sorcerer. The wizard would use his knowledge of arcana, that is hidden wisdom, for socially beneficial purposes. The sorcerer would instead use his knowledge of hidden wisdom to do whatever most benefited himself at the expense of everyone else. (This again draws on Cirlot and Chevalier.)

In this tale, the wolf is someone akin to a trickster or con man. The con man uses his heightened perception to analyze his mark for weaknesses, which he then exploits to his self-benefit and their expense. This is akin to the path of the sorcerer rather than the wizard. The con man uses his ability to see the hidden and the secret wisdom he gleams to socially harmful rather than beneficial ends.

Our wolf indeed loves to plot and scheme. He is careful to wait to enjoy his feast (the yield of his scam) until Red Riding Hood (RRH) is at her grandmother's house. He wants to escape detection by the nearby woodcutters. And he craftily fishes out RRH's destination from her so he will know where he will make his strike. And of course, once he disposes of her grandmother, he uses the disguise of her appearance to further deceive RRH and pull off his scheme.

# Entering the Shadows of the Woods

RRH seems to have not yet developed an understanding of the full spectrum of the human experience. She seems rather unaware of its darker aspects. Thus she really had no business taking a casual stroll through the less tamed realm of the forest.

The forest was usually viewed in times past as a dangerous, chaotic place. There was a greater prevalence of wolves or bears in previous eras. It was often seen as the opposite of civilization, the realm of beast rather than that of mankind.

Yet, here we have RRH casually walking through it as if it's just  a harmless walk down the street to see Grandma. She's even carrying desirable goods (cakes and butter) that will make her a target to the unsavory presences that were historically seen as dwelling in the rough and untamed woods.

She is also hooded. Cloaking relates to shrouding or obscuring things from vision. Her hood further symbolizes that there are still important things for her to learn that are still hidden from her. She still has much to learn about the darker parts of humanity.

Sadly, RRH demonstrates in her ill-advised stroll that she is the ideal mark for our wolf.

# Devoured by the Wolf 

Since devouring can symbolize either literal death or transformation, the fate of our young friend is somewhat open to interpretation. The tale is really intended to give us a cautionary note about what is likely to happen when someone like RRH who is still rather innocent in the ways of the world heads into the savage domain of the wolf. (The ancient Greek story of Adonis is strikingly similar.)

Symbolism is generally less interested in the particulars of what happened to a character. It's more a vehicle to let us learn about the human experience.

Thus, it's quite ambiguous exactly how much of RRH perishes. Devouring could mean the end of her current way of being. That the experience will have a sort of shock factor that causes her to learn more about the darker parts of the world. And thus that such learning will transform her into someone more discerning, the rise of a new way of being.

Or it could simply mean death. A brutal end that would really imprint the story in our collective mythos and hopefully motivate us to learn from RRH's fate.

# Avoiding the Clutches of the Wolf

In *The Golden Ass of Apuleius*, depth psychologist and symbolism expert M L von Franz noted how modern man seems to have lost some of his instinctual ability to 'sniff out' trouble. This is because we have lost our appreciation of intuition and our capability to use it. (Another Redditor first realized that this tale relates to a loss of intuition, as noted in the acknowledgements section below. I built upon this considerably by figuring out *how* these are related.)

When we don't use intuition correctly, there is an outpouring of useless ideas or muck from the depths into the conscious mind. However, I've found that when we properly train intuition, we instead receive an inpouring of golden nuggets of wisdom from the depths.

We have become so fond of our analytical mind that we've learned to embrace it while scorning intuition. We've learned to understand the world by chopping it up into smaller and smaller categories. We want to have a word for everything, even things that barely differ. We make distinctions until we see everything as different. Lattes and espressos are seen as very different even though it's just two coffees, one with milk foam. There are so many things we want to precisely describe that we focus on quantity rather than quality.

We're distracted by learning so many words. We waste so much time trying to learn all of these words and all the fine distinctions between them. But few of these distinctions are actually relevant to the heart of the human condition.

All this effort is a distraction. We focused all of our efforts trying to precisely define the distinction between a widget and a doohickey. All of this instead of identifying the key words that pinpoint important aspects of the human experience. We needed to put our effort into gaining a crystal-clear understanding of these most important parts of the human condition and how they interrelate. Not wasting our time learning to make millions of silly distinctions between words that barely differ. How important really is the difference between a quandary and dilemma?

We have neutered our power of intuition because we didn't give it what it needs to operate. To use intuition, we have to develop a crystal-clear understanding of how the most important things in life relate to each other. The intuitive mind can then build upon this to form new insights by bringing together what we already know.

It's a process of fusion. Intuition merges together ideas we already have to forge the conclusion that comes from bringing the information together. It brings together what we already understand. It mines what we already know to derive new insights. It sees how our existing thoughts can fit together in a way that reaches a new conclusion. It is creativity, the birth of new ideas shaped by what we already believe to be true.

But this whole process comes to a halt when our minds are scattered and disorganized. And the modern mind is filled with facts about slight distinctions between hundreds of thousands of words. It would be better to throw out the vast majority of this bramble, an abundance of trivia, a bunch of facts that explain slight distinctions between hundreds of thousands of mostly unimportant words. How much of his trivia actually says something important about the core human experience?

We need to instead fill the mind with things that really matter. The mind should be a vessel containing the most important information to let us successfully navigate life. We should not focus on the precise difference between different forms of coffee before we narrow in on a satisfactory and useful definition of love!

Intuition cannot work for most people today because our minds are filled to the brim with precise delineations between hundreds of thousands of things that barely matter. Whereas the modern man would struggle to precisely define important things like exactly what are the emotions and how exactly do they relate. The modern mind is a confused jumble of largely unimportant information that lacks a clear understanding of the most important things about the human experience.

What then do we expect? That intuition is somehow going to fuse together our vague ideas about the human condition to form meaningful insights? Of course not. We've directed our conscious effort to understanding the precise difference between different types of food or alcohol. But most people won't try to put a similar level of effort into trying to understand how exactly say anxiety relates to fear.

We put little conscious effort into trying to crystalize our understanding of the inner workings of the mind. And we expect the unconscious mind to just figure out all the connections for us. We expect it to just magically tell us when we are in danger when we put in little to no effort to understand the nature of trickery and deception.

The unconscious mind cannot work for us if we don't do the work to help it understand the basics of things like trickery and deception it's supposed to protect against. We only have a vague understanding of these things, as it they are just one more word in a sea of hundreds of thousands. As if ""trickery"" has the same importance as ""donut."" Actually, I think most people today could provide a more adequate definition of the donut. Even though defending against deception is core to the human experience so we need to understand it much better than the popular sugar bagel.

Our collective lack of focus and our idea that a vague understanding of key aspects of the human condition is enough to get by is why we succumb to the wolf. We wing it regarding these important things and then we end up in the wolf's jaws. We spend more time learning distinctions between different types of alcohol or food than clearly understanding say the emptions and the inner world of the mind. These vague notions of these important concepts aren't enough for the unconscious to work with. We haven't bothered to try to understand the nature of deceit clearly enough for our unconscious to be able to put together the clues and tell us that we are in trouble. This is why modern man succumbs to the wolf.

# Acknowledgements

I would like to recognize an insight from another Redditor who also wrote an [interpretation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/s/lNs6EfI7mb) of RRH. She brilliantly intuited that the tale related to a lack of connection with the intuitive mind, but she didn't provide many details about how a disconnection from intuition could cause us to fall to the wolf.

I then remembered that von Franz had connected modern man's increased susceptibility to deception to him being increasingly detached from instinct in *The Golden Ass of Apuleius*. I also found some of her various remarks there about specific symbols helpful, especially the nose and the ears. 

After much thought on the nature of intuition, I figured out how to significantly build on von Franz' conclusions to connect a susceptibility to deception to a disconnection from intuition, rather than just a disconnection from instinct. This was very difficult, but I was glad I could add a variety of my own thoughts to align von Franz' insights with the other Redditor's brilliant intuition about this story's relation to a disconnected intuition.

I also found dictionaries of symbolism, especially those by [Chevalier](https://www.amazon.com/Penguin-Dictionary-Symbols/dp/0140512543) and [Cirlot](https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Symbols-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1681371979), helpful in preparing this interpretation. Both of those dictionaries also draw from Carl Jung's writings.

No one was going to step in and say, “Alright, you’ve had your fun, let’s get back to being a kid.”

It wasn’t sad, necessarily it just felt… real. That feeling of responsibility sinking in, of understanding that life keeps moving whether you’re ready or not.

1k57jp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k57jp8/does_the_presto_electric_coffee_percolator_02811/,Does the Presto Electric Coffee Percolator 02811 Deliver Superior Coffee? Detailed Review,"The stainless-steel Presto 02811 Electric Coffee Percolator has been my daily coffee companion for a while now, and I must say, it’s managed to surprise me in more ways than one. This isn’t your average coffee machine; it brings a blend of elegance and old-school charm to the quintessential coffee-brewing experience. Its polished design fits seamlessly on my countertop, and its promise of brewing up to 12 cups of rich, flavorful coffee was definitely a selling point. But like any product, it comes with both glowing features and some quirks.

**Elegant Design for Timeless Appeal**  
Straightaway, that sleek, stainless-steel body makes an impression. It evokes a bit of nostalgia thanks to its traditional coffee pot design, but let’s not kid ourselves—it feels like it belongs equally in a modern kitchen or at a fancy gathering. The spout design is practical yet classy, making pouring coffee feel like a refined task instead of a chaotic struggle. I’ve even had guests wistfully comment on its style, wondering if they’ve teleported to a 1950s coffee commercial. 

**Functional Yet Simple Brewing Process**  
Brewing coffee with this percolator is a breeze. You can whip up as little as two cups or go all out with 12, depending on your caffeine devotion that day. Each cup takes about a minute to brew, which, let me tell you, feels satisfyingly brisk without rushing the full-bodied coffee flavor. The automatic keep-hot function kept my coffee at a drinkable temperature for hours without it tasting stale—bonus points for that.

**Upsides**  
Using this percolator daily has given me an appreciation for its good sides:  
- The luxurious stainless-steel construction is incredibly easy to clean and resistant to wear, ensuring it still looks brand-new despite heavy use.  
- Loud alarms or notifications can be obnoxious in the morning, but the signal light subtly lets me know when the coffee’s ready, sparing my groggy self unnecessary drama.  
- Both the filter basket and perk tube are stainless steel, which means I’m not dealing with fragile plastic parts breaking over time.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Of course, not everything about it is stainless perfection.  
- The coffee maker is not immersible, which turns dishwashing into a careful process unless you want an electric mishap on your hands.  
- Its bulky design, while appealing aesthetically, can hog counter space in a small kitchen.  
- There’s no pre-set timer or programmable functions, which could be a deal-breaker for someone accustomed to waking up to already brewed coffee.

**Taste and Brewing Quality**  
Here’s the kicker: this coffee is no watery disappointment. As someone who has tested more coffee makers than I can count, this percolator delivers rich, piping-hot cups of coffee that pack a satisfying punch. The flavor depth is on par with pricier options, especially when you use good-quality grounds. Even my co-worker, a self-proclaimed coffee snob, gave it the nod of approval. However, fair warning: the grind matters. Too coarse or too fine, and you’ll end up rethinking your life choices halfway through your first sip.

**Competitive Options**  
It’s impossible not to compare this percolator to newer coffee machines and drip models. Products like the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 or the Keurig K-Classic stand out for their sleek, all-digital interfaces and programmable features. Yet, those machines often lack the timeless aesthetic and durability that this percolator exudes. If the goal is the best-tasting coffee under aesthetically pleasing, polished steel conditions, Presto has an edge. But for users who crave convenience and tech-forward functionality, some competing brands might suit them better.

**Bang for the Buck**  
From my perspective, the price-to-quality ratio justifies the purchase. It’s not the most affordable coffee maker, but it compensates in durability and consistent performance. With stainless-steel components that won’t wear down easily, it’s a long-term investment rather than a quick fix for caffeine needs. Think of it as upgrading your coffee routine with a reliable partner that never burns out—unlike you on a Monday morning.

PART 1 Los Angeles, a city of secrets. The Santa Monica Pier creaks under the weight of its shadows.
Sidney Johnson was a colossus, his once-chiseled face buried under gluttony, a bag of shelled peanuts always in his pocket to steady his temper. He’d clawed a shipping empire from a small firm, funded by an uncle’s inheritance, but ambition choked out affection. In his youth, he wed Elaine—a blue-eyed knockout pregnant with his child—to dodge scandal. Fatherhood was a cage he despised. Elaine, vain as a peacock, treated their daughter, Marla, like a plaything, doting when it suited her, ignoring her otherwise. To Johnson, Marla was a ledger line, a costly error paid in cold cash.
Peter Duarte, Johnson’s shadow, was a wiry 5’10” with bulging eyes and a Hungarian accent that curled like cigarette smoke. They’d met on a ship years back, where Duarte’s knife settled a gambler’s debt with chilling precision. When Johnson bought the firm, he made Duarte his fixer—running crews, burying problems, guarding secrets. Loyal as a dog, Duarte never questioned orders, his sinister edge a perfect blade for Johnson’s ruthless hand.
Marla grew wild, her beauty a middle finger to her father’s neglect. Johnson packed her off to fancy schools to keep her out of sight, greasing palms to cover her failures. Each bribe stoked his fury, driving him deeper into opium, supplied by Duarte. He swelled into a caricature, peanuts crunching as he seethed. Elaine, meanwhile, chased trysts with Mexican laborers at their estate, discreet enough to skirt Johnson’s wrath. Marla, sharp with her father’s cunning and venom, unraveled at UCLA. By her final year, she was snorting coke, turning tricks for cash despite her family’s millions, and running with Louis Morello, a mafia pimp, and his gorilla of a brother, Ralph. One Monday night, she vanished from her off-campus apartment, gone like a ghost.
Tom Hart’s office reeked of stale coffee and regret. The PI, stocky from his boxing days, nursed a whiskey when Peter Duarte slunk in, eyes glinting like a cornered rat’s. He slid an envelope across the desk—$1000 in crisp bills. “Find Marla,” Duarte said, Hungarian vowels sharp as a switchblade. Tom counted the cash, squinting. “Give me something.”
Duarte’s cheekbones caught the lamplight. “Marla’s the daughter of my boss, Sidney Johnson. UCLA student. Troubled. Her father pays her bills, keeps his distance. Her mother loves her but… she’s got her own distractions.” He paused, words measured. “It’s messy.”
Tom caught the slip. “You said her mother loves her. Not her father.” Duarte’s eyes flickered, but he shrugged. “I’ve got to go, Hart. Call me with progress.” He left a number and Marla’s apartment address, insisting Johnson stay out of it. Tom shook his clammy hand, already smelling a rat. Duarte was hiding something, and Johnson’s absence roared louder than a .38.
Tom hit the pavement, starting at UCLA. Professors called Marla brilliant but unhinged, classmates a loner with a razor tongue. Whispers told a darker tale: by night, she turned tricks for $200 a pop, tied to Louis Morello and his brother Ralph, who ran a Wilshire Boulevard storefront. Their “supermarket delivery” fronted for numbers, dope, loans, and girls. Tom headed there, license ready.
The office stank of cigars and bad decisions. Louis, dark-eyed and slick, lounged in his chair, all charm and menace. Ralph, a slab of muscle with a face like a tombstone, loomed behind. A bookshelf held sports books, family photos, and a framed picture of Marla, her smile a knife in the gut. “Tom Hart, PI,” Tom said, flashing his badge. “Looking for Marla Johnson.”
Louis smirked. “Wasting your time, Hart. We know nothing.” Tom nodded at Marla’s photo. “Heard you two were tight. Heard you pimped her.” Louis’s face went ice-cold, Ralph’s fists twitched, but Tom held Louis’s gaze. “You come in here slinging mud?” Louis snapped. “Where’s she at?”
“Where’s she?” Tom fired back. “Last time you saw her?” Louis’s voice broke, raw. “A month back. Been searching everywhere. Nobody’s seen her.” His eyes glistened—grief, twisted but real. Tom slid his card over. “We both want her found. Call if you hear anything.” Louis nodded, staring at the floor. Tom left, Marla’s photo burning in his mind.
PART 2
Back at his office, Tom slumped behind his desk. Beth, his matronly secretary, handed him a note: Duarte called, sounding like a man on the edge. Before Tom could dial, the phone rang. “She’s dead,” Duarte barked, voice like a snapped wire. “Washed up on Santa Monica Beach. Shot, tossed in the ocean.” Tom’s stomach lurched. “How’s Johnson holding up?” Duarte ignored him. “Make calls. Get back to me.” Click.
Tom rang Steve Foley, a detective from his LAPD days. “Marla Johnson case,” Tom said. “What’s the word?” Steve’s voice was grim. “Washed ashore last night. ID’d her this morning via dental records. In the water weeks, shot in the head. I’m at the morgue—meet me.” Tom drove over, finding Steve outside, cigarette glowing. Inside, Marla’s body was bones and decay, the ocean’s cruel art. “Bullet killed her before she hit the water,” Steve said. “Cleans evidence nice.”
Tom laid it out: Duarte’s cash, Marla’s double life, the Morellos’ denial. He kept Louis’s grief quiet, unsure why. “I’m hitting the Morellos tomorrow, 9 a.m.,” Steve said. “Two uniforms for Ralph’s knuckles. You in?” Tom nodded. “Count me.”
They staked out the Morellos’ office from a car across Wilshire. At 11 a.m., the brothers rolled up, clueless Marla’s body had surfaced—Steve kept it hushed. After fifteen minutes, they barged in: Steve, Tom, two cops. Louis leapt up. “What the hell’s this?” Steve didn’t blink. “Marla’s dead. Washed up with a .38 slug in her skull.” Louis sank into his chair, muttering “No, no,” tears welling. Steve scoffed. “Save the act, Morello. We know you pimped her, know you both snorted coke. You sold her for $200 a trick—don’t play the mourner.”
Louis’s face twisted, rage overtaking grief. “I loved her,” he growled. “Get me my lawyer.” Steve flashed a warrant. “Sit tight.” The cops tore through the office. Behind Marla’s photo, one found a .38 revolver. Steve lifted it with a pencil, grinning. “Well, now.” Louis erupted. “You framed me, Hart!” he roared as cuffs snapped on. “You planted it!” Tom stayed quiet, staring at the shelf. He’d clocked that photo yesterday—no gun. His mind screamed: Duarte.
PART 3
Tom stormed back to his office, fury boiling. Beth was gone, the room a cave of shadows. Steve called, voice electric. “Found an earring on the pier, stuck between planks. Marla’s—her mother confirmed it. Bullet casing too, under rocks. Waiting on ballistics, but I’d bet my badge it matches the Morellos’ .38. Case closed.” Tom wasn’t sold. Too tidy, too quick. Duarte’s fingerprints were all over this.
He lit a cigarette, piecing it together. Johnson loathed Marla, saw her as a threat to his empire. Her coke habit, mobster boyfriend, and hooking were a scandal he couldn’t stomach, especially in his opium haze, peanuts crunching as he raved. He’d turned to Duarte, his loyal hound. “End it,” Johnson must’ve said. Duarte, ever the fixer, didn’t blink. Tom pictured it: Duarte luring Marla to the pier with a cash drop, same as he’d done for years to keep her quiet. This time, he brought a .38. One shot, one push into the tide. The ocean would scrub her clean, leaving only bones and a bullet.
Tom needed proof, something to crack Duarte’s icy facade. The pier was the key—someone had to have seen something. He’d heard whispers at the precinct: kids fished there at night, dodging cops for extra cash. A long shot, but he was out of cards. He grabbed his coat and hit the Santa Monica Pier at 8 p.m., the fog rolling in like a bad omen. The boards creaked under his weight, the ocean’s murmur swallowing his thoughts. He sat on a bench, eyes scanning the shadows, praying for a break.
An hour passed—nothing. The fog thickened, blurring the Ferris wheel’s glow. Then he spotted a kid, maybe 14, Mexican, crouched under the pier with a crab trap, his hands quick and sure. Tom approached, steps soft. “Late for crabbing, kid. School tomorrow?”
The boy looked up, wary, his face half-lit by a dangling bulb. “Crabs come out at night, mister. Helps my ma with the rent.” His voice was steady, but his eyes flicked to the shadows.
“You here often?” Tom asked, crouching to his level. “Say, a month back?” The kid’s hands froze on the trap, his breath catching. Tom leaned closer, voice low. “Son, a woman died here. Blonde, pretty. I think you saw something. A good kid like you—you don’t want that weight on your soul.”
The boy’s eyes darted, scared but stubborn. “Didn’t see nothing. I just crab.” Tom pulled a twenty from his pocket, sliding it across the sand. “I’m not a cop, kid. Just a guy trying to save an innocent man. What’s your name?”
“Juan,” he muttered, pocketing the cash. He hesitated, then spoke, voice barely a whisper. “I was here… a month ago, maybe. Heard a shot, saw a guy—tall, creepy eyes. He pushed something into the water. I hid behind the rocks, didn’t move till he was gone.”
Tom’s pulse quickened. “What’d he look like? Anything else?” Juan shrugged, nervous. “Dark coat, funny voice—not like my uncle’s. Kinda… foreign. That’s all I got.” It wasn’t perfect, but it was enough. Duarte’s bulging eyes, his Hungarian lilt—Juan’s words fit like a glove. Tom’s mind raced: a scared kid’s story could spook Duarte, especially if Tom sold it right. He flashed his badge, keeping his voice calm. “You’re brave, Juan. Stay quiet for now. I’ll handle it.”
He hit a payphone, calling Steve. “Get to the pier. Got a witness.” Steve arrived in twenty, skeptical but listening. Juan retold his story, less certain now, his hands shaking. “Tall guy, weird eyes, funny talk. Shot her, I think.” Steve’s jaw tightened. “Matches Duarte. We’ll bring him in.” Tom nodded, but his gut churned. Juan’s story was gold, but shaky—too shaky for court. He’d have to play dirty to make it stick.
PART 4
The next morning, Tom and Steve rolled up to Johnson’s mansion, two uniformed cops in tow. A maid answered, fetching Duarte. He slunk in, eyes darting like a trapped weasel. “What’s this about?” Steve flashed his badge. “You and Johnson. Together. Now.” Duarte bristled. “Necessary? Johnson’s busy. You’ve got the Morellos locked up.” Tom stepped forward, voice low. “That’s what you’d like us to think.”
Duarte led them to Johnson’s office, a den of mahogany and cigar haze. Johnson rose, a sweating titan, peanuts spilling from his pocket. “Gentlemen, my thanks for nabbing my daughter’s killers.” Tom’s blood boiled—evil cloaked in charm. He leaned in, cool as a cardsharp. “One question, boys. Why hire me to find Marla when you knew she was dead?”
Johnson’s jowls shook. “Preposterous, Hart! I thought her missing, not dead. How dare you insinuate otherwise?” Tom didn’t budge. “It was a smokescreen. You played concerned father to cover your tracks. You had her killed. And you,” he turned to Duarte, “you did the deed.”
Duarte’s eyes narrowed, silent, betting Tom was grasping. Johnson sputtered, but Tom pulled a tape recorder from his satchel, slamming it on the desk. He hit play. Juan’s voice quavered: “I saw him… shot her in the back of the head, pushed her into the ocean.” Duarte froze, mind racing—Johnson’s wealth, fancy lawyers, they’d tear a kid’s story apart. He almost smirked.
Then Johnson bellowed, pointing at Duarte. “Seize that wretch! He killed my daughter! He’s a crook—burglary in Budapest as a youth. He planted that gun in Morello’s office!” Duarte lunged, cuffs catching his wrists. “You traitor!” he hissed, pure venom. “After all I’ve done, you stab me? Fine—his books in the cabinet? Phony. The real ones hide in a safe behind that Manet. He’s been robbing the government blind. He thought Marla’d sink him, so he paid me to kill her. Paranoid, opium-soaked fool!”
“Enough!” Steve roared. “Tell it to the jury.” He nodded to the cops. “Cuff ‘em. Murder one.” Johnson and Duarte, still snarling, were hauled out. Tom packed the recorder, face heavy. Steve clapped his shoulder. “You got ‘em, Hart. Knew they’d turn like alley rats.” Tom sighed. “Rat bastards. Poor Marla—beautiful, doomed from the start.”
“I owe you,” Steve said. “When you called me from the pier at 2 a.m., raving about an eyewitness, I thought this case drove you nuts. When I got there and heard your half-baked plan to have the landscaper’s kid from your building record a fake account of Duarte killing Marla, I nearly threw you in the water. But it worked. Worked like a charm. Breakfast at my place? Maggie’s got the griddle hot.” Tom cracked a grin. “Can’t say no. I’m starved.” They walked out, the mansion’s gloom swallowing Marla’s ghost.",1,1745331490.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

* **avoid fat-heavy meals before meds** – they slow down how it absorbs
* **L-theanine + coffee** = smooth focus instead of manic gremlin
* **set timers to eat** – otherwise you’ll remember at 4pm when you’re crying in the carpark

# 💩 Poop Talk (yep, we’re going there)

ADHD + stimulants + hormones = *chaotic digestion*. here’s how I’ve kept things moving (literally):

* **constipation** \- magnesium glycinate, chia seeds, water, fibre
* **diarrhea/bloating** \- cut artificial sweeteners + greasy foods
* **no appetite = low digestion** \- ginger tea, warm oats, smoothies are my go-to

* **no phone after 9pm** (ok I fail but it *does* help)
* **sleep mask, fan noise, herbal tea**

snacks that don’t fight back depending on where my hormones are at:

* **Menstrual** – dark choc, berries, turmeric latte
* **Follicular** – eggs, salmon, spinach smoothies
* **Ovulatory** – fruit, protein balls, cucumber + hummus

Need help,"TLDR My symptoms specifically are nausea with burping and acid coming up, extreme anxiety with adrenaline rushes and dumps and fatigue. I’m also feeling overly sensitive to light and sound and need little stimulation. It takes all morning and sometimes all day for my body to regulate. 

I’m waking up the last few days with extremely high cortisol (I don’t know my levels I’m just assuming because of really bad anxiety) my anxiety is so bad and I try to push through it and drink my coffee but it gets worse. Then I try to eat a small lunch/breakfast that also needs to be packed with a stupid amount of protein or fiber, because if I don’t eat enough calories later in the day I’ll start feeling like I have low blood sugar.

After I eat, it takes alllll morning, and afternoon, until 1-2 pm I finally feel better enough to do what I need to do. Then at night is the only time I feel better and confident.

This morning I woke up nauseous because I didn’t eat a big dinner the other night I’m guessing. So I got up and made 1 egg, 1 breakfast sausage, had a Greek yogurt and a protein bar. I thought something in my stomach would help. I also tried to drink my coffee. I have to force it down then I gag.

Now I’m laying in bed, having dystaumia symptoms, still burping up my breakfast, exauhsted and fatigued mentally and of course I do have anxiety. I’m also feeling weak and shakey.

Some other factors right now that I’m not sure how to address: I am on my luteal phase before my period. I’m also dealing with a major stress event right now

Not a coffee person myself but SO is and uses an aeropress. We currently have a cheap no-name grinder from years ago and I'm looking to gift an upgrade.

Criteria are:

- grinds relatively quickly (currently takes quite long! Means skipping coffee some mornings)
- electric or manual is both okay
- £120 or less 
- min. capacity of ~30 g of beans
- available in the UK (some brands seem US specific?)

When my gf suggest some place to dine i only think that ive never could found a place like this and how inadequate i am, my gf loves me so much and treats me like a king literally but i fake the life so so much she really dont know who i am.. because of this i deeply hate and feel like her love and treatment is conditional due to fake me.. and i realized how narcissistic person i was, everything crashed down. All those years i lived with “the mask i believed real” is finally down but i fricking hate so much of myself,

I regularly clean my house, working less and less, walk with my dog, and i do not enjoy anything not a single thing, i own a bussines and im not going to the work anymore, employees acting like they own the place and idgaf. I dont spend the money i make, coffee and food only.. Sex with gf feels like a chore from her because i cant see myself that anyone would want me in that way. I wouldnt if i was woman.. the last time I initiated sex is like 2 years ago. No joke. Ive always hold myself back because im sure she will reject me..

I dont know what i am going through right know but im sure that i feel like im a failure, i could do more, i could enjoy more, i could give more, and feeling like time is slipping away from my hands and i am only 27..

Even now, when i say i have a gf, and the job i have i feel like im showing off, because im from a wealthy family and money is the only thing and reason why people bullied me when i was kid.. you just cant imagine how many times people, teachers etc. around me said things like; why do you event study when you are this rich? If i was you… if i had that money… hey you met this guy he is my friend and his family owns this this, the first thing people know about me how rich i am sorry how rich is MY FATHER is.. , i just cant count amount of the teachers told me i will ruin my family bussines.. like you dont even know me wtf is this ? Since PRIMARY SCHOOL.

I hate that my bussines isnt a multi million worth while my fathers supports me this much, i dont know what to say, sometimes i say to myself stop acting like spoiled brat and do more, but i have ZERO life expectancy from myself and im not the guy i wished and i worked for , and never be.

I dont know if this is a real mental issue or something but i needed a place to share. ",1,1745331329.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

Yesterday was a good day - had a doctor ordered ultrasound on my abdomen, was looking to see if/or how badly my life long affair with booze had damaged my liver. Blood tests over the past six months indicated a problem with elevated enzymes, so the ultrasound was ordered to see what the real damage is. In doctor speak - the images were “unremarkable” - indicating that everything looks “nominal”. That is good news and well-taken, and helped resolve a significant amount of anxiety I was holding on to, just in case the results were less favorable. 

This morning, over coffee, had a great conversation with my wife about the results and my path forward and we are both resolved to continue our journeys and to honor our relationships by fully supporting where we are and where we are heading.

Much of my gratitude goes out to u/stopdrinking for your support through sharing your support and stories along the way - I’ve been inspired by hearing from legends, long-timers, and everyone else who is sharing this path with me. Your success stories and tips as well as the shared hiccups are meaningful and I take them all to heart - thank you!

Next blood work is late June, hoping to see improvements over the last set in late February, but I know, those results are entirely up to me. Thank you for reading through this long-ish post -  I will not be drinking with you today!",11,1745331288.0,stopdrinking,5,1.0,False
1k57d83,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k57d83,"Advice with lawn/spots from dogs, Michigan","I recently purchased a home last year and am pretty new to taking care of a lawn so any and all advice is welcomed! 

I’m not exactly sure where to start to fix the grass. The first three pictures are in the front yard. There’s two giant coniferous trees in the front that always drop a bunch of pine needles. I cleaned all the needles up this spring (about 25 backs worth) but I’m wondering if the needles could have stunted the growth of the grass in the front. Or the grass is still just dormant and waking up from the winter? It’s been in the mid 50’s lately. 
Also, in the front there seems to be a spongier moss type vegetation in the grass in some areas. What could I do about that? Is there a specific product for killing that sort of stuff and not the grass?

 I also live in a main road so there’s lots of foot traffic which I think caused the corner to wear down to dirt. Any suggestions on regrowing grass in the areas that are down to dirt? 

In some areas there are spots where clovers grow within the grass. Is there something that I could put down to eliminate the clovers and not harm the grass? Or do I dig up the bad areas and restart from fresh soil?

The last picture is in the back yard. There are some areas where the grass has been killed from the dogs using the bathroom over the winter in the snow. I have read that some people just heavily water the spots that are dead in order to dilute the nitrogen. Would this work or should I put a certain product on it?

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated! I look forward to the day where I can stand on my porch and sip coffee admiring my yard like a proud dad  ",1,1745331282.0,lawncare,3,1.0,False
