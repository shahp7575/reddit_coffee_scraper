1mb2w2h,https://i.redd.it/bttczlnqliff1.jpeg,Does Anyone Want this Big Grande Poster?,"From their tour in ohhhh I want to say 2022? I tried to sell it on eBay for $800 but no luck so now I'm giving it away as long as you're willing to cover shipping.

It's not really my style of decor but I got shy at the show and couldn't approach the fellas without an offering, so I bought this and asked them to sign it.The poster is signed, but only by Dan, Ryan, and Jon (Drew was not at the Chicago show I saw). It's also a bit scuffed and I think there's the vague outline of a coffee stain on the cannon. Other than that it's in fine condition and I would feel bad tossing it. 

Let me know if you want it! Like I said, it's free other than paying to ship it from Oregon. First person who wants it gets it. It will take me a day or two to get back to anyone who responds to this, I am very busy with the responsibilities and pressures of my magisterial lifestyle.",1,1753664777.0,Earwolf,0,1.0,False

I left my family and friends behind to build up a new life. I love living here, have a great job, and everything, but it feels so hard to build up genuine friendships that last, like someone to meet up with regularly to have a coffee, or go on a walk. I have tons of interests: I like hiking, working out,  visiting musea, playing pickleball, trivia, etc but it does feel harder at times to go through weekends alone. I am dreading the upcoming holidays again, spending another Christmas all by myself, it is slightly getting under my skin. I am happy to hear tips from other people where and how to connect with others, perhaps if someone has any suggestions where to volunteer in the community for example?

1mb2ueb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GBiLaL_77/comments/1mb2ueb/one_more_plate/,One More Plate,"The cabin had been Uncle Dan’s dream—his and Marie’s. They bought it a year ago, a secluded retreat nestled deep in the woods where they planned to grow old together. Now, six months after her funeral, my uncle stood in the doorway looking hollowed out, the keys trembling in his hand.

Marie’s death—to say the least—was unnatural. A maintenance worker found her hanging from the ceiling. The investigation turned up no evidence of foul play, and it was ruled a suicide. But it didn’t make sense to anyone who knew her, least of all Uncle Dan.

*""Just need to get her things,""* he’d told me, his voice rough with grief. That’s why we came—just me, my best friend Ryan, and Uncle Dan. A weekend trip to help him sort through memories, to maybe begin healing.

None of us expected the storm.

# The First Day

The cabin looked smaller than I remembered, hunched between the pines like it was trying to hide. Ryan let out a low whistle as we unloaded the car.

*""Place gives me the creeps,""* he muttered.

He wasn’t wrong. The woods pressed in too close, the shadows between the trees too deep.

Uncle Dan moved through the rooms like a ghost, trailing his fingers over the quilt Marie had made, the coffee mug with her lipstick still faint on the rim. Ryan and I exchanged glances when we found the bedroom—her nightgown still laid out on the bed, as if she’d just stepped away for a moment.

# The Storm

The rain came at dawn, a sudden violence that shook the cabin. By noon, the power died, plunging us into a gloom broken only by lightning flashes. Uncle Dan lit candles, their flickering light catching the wedding photo on the mantel—Marie’s smile suddenly alive in the wavering glow.

That’s when the first plate shattered.

We all jumped at the sound from the kitchen. There, on the floor, lay one of Marie’s ceramic plates in pieces. The cupboard door swung gently, though no one had been near it.

*""Wind must’ve—""* Ryan started, but stopped when we saw it.

A single place setting at the table. One plate. One fork. One glass.

*""Set where Marie always sat,""* Uncle Dan whispered.

# The First Night

The rain didn’t stop, and driving in the storm was too dangerous. We stayed.

I woke to the creak of floorboards. Through my cracked door, I saw Uncle Dan shuffling down the hall in his robe—the one Marie had given him. He paused at the top of the stairs, his head tilting as if listening to something. Then he continued down, humming her favorite song.

Ryan stirred beside me. *""Your uncle sleepwalk?""* he asked, eyes darting toward the hallway.

I turned to answer—then we heard it.

A thud. The sound of struggling.

I bolted up, my legs moving before my mind could process what was happening. But when I reached the living room, I froze.

Uncle Dan hung from the same beam where Marie had been found, his body jerking, his feet kicking at empty air. I wanted to scream, to run forward, to *do* something—but my legs refused to move. All I could do was watch as his movements slowed… then stopped.

Ryan appeared behind me, wide-eyed, just as paralyzed.

The second we could move, we rushed to him, cutting him down, performing CPR—but it was too late. He was gone.

We tried calling emergency services, but the storm had taken out the signal.

# The Second Day

By morning, the storm had worsened, but Ryan managed to get a broken signal through.

*""Emergency responders can’t reach you until the storm passes,""* the dispatcher said. *""Stay inside. Wait for the investigation team.""*

Ryan didn’t like that. He stormed off, muttering about needing a drink. I followed him to the kitchen—then froze.

The table was set again.

Two plates. Two forks. Two glasses.

*""Did you—?""* I started.

Ryan shook his head, already rummaging through the cabinets. He found Uncle Dan’s whiskey stash.

I felt guilty opening it, but if there was ever a time for drinking, it was now. It didn’t take us long to finish the bottle. I wasn’t a heavy drinker, but Ryan was. Hours slipped by in a blur, the storm distorting time.

When I finally looked up, the kitchen was littered with empty bottles.

*""Ryan, this isn’t normal,""* I slurred, only to realize he wasn’t there.

I called his name. No answer. Just the relentless drum of rain.

Then I saw it.

The table was set again.

**Three plates. Three forks. Three glasses.**

Dread coiled in my stomach. I knew where he was.

I found him in the living room, hanging from the same beam, his face pale, his body cold. I cut him down, though I knew it was pointless. He’d been dead for hours.

# The Last Night

Now, I sit in the dark, writing this to keep my mind clear. To fight the heaviness dragging at my eyelids.

The cabin did this. I don’t know how, but I know it’s the reason.

All I can do now is wait.

All I can do is listen to the rain…

…and the sound of a fourth plate being set on the table.

Can I run supply/drain lines to new sink outside the walls?,"This is how the contractor left things when they demoed out what was here before. The new sink is about 6 feet away from this.  It’s a kitchenette in our guest suite.  Would there be any issue attaching pex to these and running the drain line along the wall to here?    We may do a more formal kitchen in the future but this is just to give the space running water for coffee, etc. 

The drain pipe entry is about a foot below the bottom of the sink, so I should have enough room for a proper p trap and still enough drop in the pipe.  I’d plan to secure everything to the wall behind the unit.

You asked me things—not just about the project, but about me. You said he doesn’t listen anymore, doesn’t see you. That night at the hotel bar, he cancelled dinner again. You sat beside me instead. We drank. Talked. Laughed. And when your hand brushed against mine, neither of us pulled away. Maybe it was wrong. Maybe it was inevitable.

He starts in his room asleep, as the player continues to make noise, opening cameras, closing doors, checking door light, etc, Speed will slowly start waking up, when he fully wakes up he will move to the second floor hallway, before going down to the first floor and then moving to the kitchen, where he will then start using the coffee maker to make coffee, You can mess with the coffee maker from the cameras to slow down the progress of the coffee maker, But you cannot fully stop it, once it is done speed will chug the coffee down and begin his attack phase, he will run from the kitchen to either one of your two doors, when he drinks his coffee one of his ears will twitch, giving away what door he's going to charge, one's near the unused room will do a rush of attacks, if he stops punch him, if he stops at either door close the door on him. Be on guard to block his attacks, after he gets punched, he will Go to leaf's room to get patched up. If Crystal gets to his room, She will jump on him and wake him up and then immediately begin running from him directly to your office, Speed will chase her to the third floor to either door of the unused room, Crystal will then sidestep in either the West or East Hall, leaving speed rushing at the respective door, if the player  shoves sunshine off of them when she is hugging them, She will start crying and will immediately wake up speed if he is still asleep, or alert speed if he is awake, he will become enraged and activate his turbo boost and immediately charge at the player, becoming insanely aggressive, if speed is woken up by Sunshine crying, he will skip going down to the kitchen all together and immediately charge at the player's doors, when speed is stopped at one door he will charge at the other door and alternate between that twice before switching to how he behaves when he is making his way to the unused room without coffee, But much more aggressive.

Jumpscare: appears from the bottom of the screen and punches the player square in the face, knocking them out. 

Jumpscare 2: chasing Crystal to one of the two hallways leading to the uneased room, Speed rushes into the room and tries to stop but can't as he crashes into the player.

Saturday morning, around 1am, I woke up out of sleep with the most intense lower back pain. I have not had a BM yet, and everything I see is related to constipation or maybe a pulled muscle. 

Over the past two days, I’ve tried MiraLAX in coffee (rarely drink coffee so though it would do the trick), senakot, psyllium husk, probiotic/prebiotic gummies. My last pain pill I took was Friday night as well.

Anyone else experience this lower back pain? It is debilitating at about a 9/10 or 10/10 pain and no position is comfortable anymore. 

Have to start remote work tomorrow and was doing everything to try and work this out prior to that but no luck. Thank you!",1,1753663689.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Preferably looking for something funny and low production quality but made in earnest, not made to be ironic. Ideally we should be left questioning how the movie ended up on a streaming service at all. Some of our favorites are:

* *Baby Cat*
* *Sophie and the Serial Killers*
* *Blood Sweat and Cheer*
* *Courting Chaos*
* *The Coffee Shop (2014)* (the gay one that looks like a YouTube sketch, not the other one)
* *Good Enough: A Modern Musical*
* *Steam Room Stories* 

We've also enjoyed many of the ""Twisted \_\_\_\_"" and ""The Wrong \_\_\_\_"" (insert any occupation or relation in the blank) movies. I think we've also already watched every killer cheerleader / cheer mom / cheer coach movie, but probably not. There are tons of those.

Some of these we love and some of them we love to hate. Anything in the same vein as any of these would be great. And if you're a bad movie lover and haven't seen any of these, check them out! My friend also said ""if they made a woke stoner movie I'd be into it"" whatever that means so if you know anything matching that description, do tell.

I secretly applied for a business trip there to surprise him.

My boss handed me a family portrait showing only four tightly clasped hands.

""This is Mr. Carter's family of four. Prepare gifts properly for this visit.""

I stared at the photo, momentarily dazed by the familiar wristwatch.

But Benjamin Carter had knelt before his parents for three days and nights just to remain childfree as DINKs.

I brushed off my doubts and went on the business trip.

Never did I expect to see my husband at the hotel with two children, his fingers intertwined with another woman's.

Seeing two faces that mirrored Benjamin's like carbon copies, I froze where I stood.

Benjamin claimed love should be pure, untainted by children.

Yet he only practiced DINK with me while raising kids elsewhere.

A colleague excitedly pushed me forward: ""It's Mr. Carter's family! How lucky! Greet them now.""

The woman instantly released Benjamin's hand and approached us:

""Are you Olivia Parker from the project team? What a surprise meeting you early. I'm Sophia Roberts Mitchell, Mrs. Carter.""

She knew me, declaring herself Benjamin's wife to my face.

How dare she act so unabashedly as a mistress?!

Recalling how my boss had suddenly allowed my project involvement, I wondered—was this her deliberate setup?

Benjamin's smile froze when he saw me. He carefully set down the little girl he was holding, took her hand, and after a moment's hesitation, extended his hand toward me.

""Nice to meet you,"" he said, pretending not to know me.

My lower teeth ache as I bite down, staring at his cold, distant face—it feels like a lifetime has passed.

After our college entrance exams, Benjamin confessed to me in front of the entire school. We then attended the same university and married right after graduation.

Ten years together, his passion gradually faded. I thought love had simply evolved into family bonds.

Turns out he had another wife and children elsewhere—a son already six years old, born the very year we married.

So all this time he's been traveling between two countries... Is it for me? Or for that happy family in New York?

Seeing I didn't shake hands, Benjamin frowned with displeasure: ""Is this how your company conducts business?""

Sophia immediately grasped his hand, soothing him with a smile:

""Sophia's just keeping a respectful distance since you're a married man. Very professional—I quite admire that in a woman.""

Her words sounded like she was defending me, yet I found myself biting the inside of my cheek to stifle a bitter laugh.

Benjamin pretended not to know me, while Sophia kept asserting her claim over him.

What did that make me?

My colleague tensed, hastily pushing down on my back to bow:

""Mr. and Mrs. Carter, please forgive her. She's just off a flight and not herself. Our deepest apologies.""

""Distance is wise. Everyone knows you're the epitome of marital bliss—a true fairy-tale couple in our circle.""

I wanted to confront Benjamin, but the fiery defiance evaporated the moment my colleague forced me into that bow.

Yeah, Benjamin is the CEO who needs to be flattered, while I'm just a small employee who has to beg the boss for a chance to join a multinational project.

Sorry, we came specifically to cooperate with you, absolutely no intention to offend.

After apologizing proactively, I bowed again, looking at Benjamin and Sophia's interlocked fingers, my eyes stung.

Sophia affectionately held Benjamin's arm:

It's okay, I also heard about your strong professional skills and that's why I put you in charge, but my husband and I are going home now, let's talk about the project another day?

**Chapter 2**

Chapter 2

We've never met before, but she seems to know me quite well. It seems that my coming to New York is indeed related to her.

Thinking about this period, the whole department has been working overtime until they have dark circles under their eyes, and the friend who's waiting for the project's success to get promoted.

I didn't say anything else, forcing a smile and nodding.

""Hope you both enjoy your evening.""

Benjamin opened his mouth as if to speak to me, but his hand was held by the child and Sophia.

He immediately turned away with a smile, scooping up the child and following Sophia.

Back at the hotel, I stared blankly at my empty phone screen.

Why couldn't Benjamin even give me an explanation?

I kept dialing his number until he hung up repeatedly, clearly annoyed, and finally blocked me.

I sat there blankly until midnight, when Benjamin's text finally came through:

\[Olivia, you know how much I love you. The child and Sophia were accidents. Step back from this project first—I'll explain everything when I'm back.\]

\[Be good. Don't make a scene.\]

Don’t make a scene?

What counts as making a scene?

Sophia wiped away tears, numbly tapping redial.

Only a blocked tone answered.

For Benjamin, I who always loved children agreed to be DINK. Yet he had kids with someone else—couldn't even give me a reason.

If the first child was an accident, what about the second one?

Ten years together, and ""stop making a scene"" is all he offers? What am I to him?

Calmer now, clinging to hope, I texted: 【When did you and her start?】

Benjamin replied: 【The die is cast. My fault. I'll compensate you—bought that island you liked last month.】

Sophia knows nothing about this.】

His reply doused the last flicker of anger in my heart like a bucket of cold water.

If moments ago I was still bewildered and furious, now my heart felt as if thrown into an ice cellar.

All emotions vanished instantly.

Indeed, I’d sensed it long ago in the subtle details of our life together—we were no longer the inseparable couple clinging to each other during our passionate early days.

At first, he traveled abroad every other month, then spent most of the year away later on, only returning for holidays. I should have realized it sooner.

I mistook it for his intense career drive, never complained, and even encouraged him to pursue his ambitions.

Lack of companionship was forgivable, but betrayal was inexcusable.

He stopped replying to my messages, and I lost the will to press further.

Early next morning, my mother-in-law called.

""Olivia, I heard you made a scene in front of Sophia! Can't you behave?""

Her scolding froze me—she'd always been gentle, never using that tone before.

I bit my lower lip, staring down at the floor. ""I didn’t, Mom.""

""I didn’t.""

""You call me Mom? Then remember Sophia is the child’s mother! Listen to me—return home now. Don’t let her discover your relationship with Benjamin.""

Her voice softened midway: ""She’s emotionally fragile with the child. Since you don’t have children, be sensible and don’t trigger her.""

My grip almost failed me—realizing she showed even more tenderness toward Sophia than toward me.

He even lashed out at me for Sophia's sake.

""But I'm Benjamin's wife, Mom.""

Summoning courage again, I sniffled and cautiously tested my mother-in-law's reaction.

She exploded instantly: ""You can't even bear a child! What kind of proper wife are you?! Benjamin hasn't divorced you only out of respect for your history. Don't push your luck.""

Years ago, when Benjamin felt downcast after being forced into business studies, I encouraged him to take over the family business.

Later, when Benjamin knelt before her for three days straight declaring he didn't want children, I spent two days mediating peace. She even praised me for being understanding and saving her trouble.

Throughout our marriage, I managed the household for years, obeying Benjamin and my mother-in-law without question, growing ever more dutiful and respectful.

Just because I didn't have a child, I was seen as pushing my luck.

And the mother-in-law I thought treated me better than my own parents actually knew long ago that Benjamin had a child outside and helped him keep me in the dark.

I was just an outsider.

Holding back my tears, I said my final words, ""Fine, let's divorce.""

Isn't it just to make room for Sophia? Fine.

**Chapter 3**

Chapter 3

As soon as dawn broke, my boss told me the project didn't go through and asked me to return home.

Although I never thought Benjamin could be so heartless, it doesn't matter anymore.

I didn't want to have any contact with them anymore, so I took out my phone, contacted a lawyer, and drafted a divorce agreement, just waiting for his signature to finalize the divorce.

However, as I was pulling my suitcase out of the hotel door, Sophia stopped me.

""Let's talk, Sophia.""

Seeing me ignore her and walk straight out, Sophia shook the file folder in her hand. ""I think you need this.""

I closed my eyes, opened them, exhaled my pent-up frustration, and followed Sophia to the coffee shop.

She pushed the coffee toward me, then twisted the ring on her finger.

""Sophia, look how hard you tried, only to get kicked out immediately. Things that aren’t yours won’t be yours no matter how hard you fight.""

""You know?""

I curled my lips into a cold smile. ""What gives you, a mistress, the right to say that to me?""

She took off her ring and handed it to me. ""See clearly?""

Benjamin has the matching men’s version of this ring, and he’s never taken it off.

My palm bled where my nails dug in, yet my expression remained unreadable. ""So what? Benjamin and I have a marriage certificate. We're husband and wife.""

Sophia shook her head and chuckled with disdain:

""You're mistaken. Marriage can end in divorce, but having a child creates an unbreakable, happy family.""

""He lied about being DINK while letting me bear his child because he never accepted you as his true wife. He's loved only me all along.""

No wonder Benjamin hated children despite his picture-perfect family.

I used to think it stemmed from psychological trauma and kept trying to help him heal through love.

The truth was... What he despised all along was my lowly, unworthy self.

My nose stung, tears welling in my eyes, but I fired back stubbornly.

""So that's why you broke up someone else's family? Are you proud of giving birth to an illegitimate child?""

She took a sip of coffee, her expression condescending: ""No, they're not illegitimate children. They're heirs to a wealthy family.""

""Even if you scheme your way into a rich family, you can't change your base bloodline. How could Benjamin let you bear heirs? Don't delude yourself.""

""He and I are a perfect match – destined for each other!""

I knew illegitimate children had inheritance rights, but I never imagined Benjamin would go so far as to name Sophia's children heirs this early.

Is this how he sees my devotion—just a scheme to get his family fortune?

Sophia looked at my crestfallen expression with a malicious grin, dropped the folder on the table, and left.

""I'm young, beautiful, and carrying his child. You saw how Benjamin treats me.

Even if you refuse to divorce, you'll get nothing from the Johnsons. Why waste your time fighting me?""

I blinked away the tears gathering at my lashes, forcing myself to endure the bitterness as I opened the folder.

Inside were two copies of a divorce agreement—

both bearing Benjamin's signature.

Benjamin once vowed never to leave me. Even after I discovered his affair, he never mentioned divorce.

Though I didn’t know how Sophia tricked him into signing these papers,

I knew one thing for certain: I needed them.

But seeing the clause that would leave me with nothing, I still trembled with anger.

What right did Sophia, a mistress, have to demand I leave with nothing?!

Stepping off the flight back home, I gradually calmed down and contacted my lawyer. I drafted a new divorce agreement, photographed it, and sent it to Benjamin.

""Sign in person or fax it?""

Finally, Benjamin's first call came through.

""Stop using divorce as a threat. I'm busy now—we'll talk later.""

Remembering him laughing with the children, my voice dripped with sarcasm:

""Oh? So this time, are you busy fathering a son or a daughter?""

**Chapter 4**

Chapter 4

His conciliatory tone vanished instantly, replaced by a cold sneer:

""Is this how your parents raised you? Go apologize to my mother immediately and learn about Following husband, or we divorce now!""

He hung up.

I returned home to find Sophia and her two children gathered harmoniously around my parents-in-law.

Sophia affectionately looped her arm through my mother-in-law's, shooting me a look of unmistakable malice:

""Miss Sophia, I've never seen anyone discuss projects in someone else's home.""

Her son frowned at me: ""Auntie, why didn't you knock? That's not polite at all.""

My mother-in-law watched me coldly—I knew this was her way of showing displeasure.

""Aren't you getting a divorce? Why bother our family?""

That unfamiliar sternness on her face pierced my heart, sending waves of intense pain through me.

I set my suitcase in the living room center and walked upstairs alone.

""Sorry.""

""I'll just pack my things and leave. Won't interfere with your family reunion dinner.""

The elderly man tapped his cane on the floor, his voice low: ""Benjamin's already on his flight home. Don't be difficult. You know how well he's treated you all these years.""

Suddenly, the little boy burst into tears: ""Is she gonna steal Daddy? Will Mommy, me, and my sister get kicked out?""

The little girl wailed in unison. Grandfather and grandmother's faces instantly softened with concern, gathering both children into their arms.

""Of course not! This is your home with Mommy and Daddy. Who'd dare make you leave?!""

The boy cried so hard he choked, coughing twice.

Grandmother patted his back gently before whirling toward me: ""Causing trouble the moment you step foot here! Olivia, did you come specifically to bring misfortune to this family?""

""You made my son choose to be DINK, and now you want to drive away my grandchildren! Get out of the Carter estate!""

Grandfather sighed, holding the little girl, and remained silent.

I looked around. My father-in-law's walking stick was one I'd chosen the finest wood for and hand-carved bit by bit for him years ago.

My mother-in-law's bracelet was something I'd specially knelt to have a master bless for protection.

Yet now, they were all surrounding Sophia in the middle, glaring coldly at me.

Instantly, everything in this house where I'd lived for six years felt so unfamiliar.

Forget it, there's nothing worth taking anyway.

But as I picked up my suitcase and headed out, Benjamin pushed the door open and snatched the suitcase from my hand.

""It's just that I didn't give you a child, but I've already given you the title of Mrs. Carter, what more do you want?""

""Just get along well with Sophia, I'll take care of the rest.""

The boy who had just calmed down burst into tears again: ""Daddy doesn't want us anymore, Daddy wants to be with this woman, wuwuwu\~""

Benjamin instantly let go of my hand and ran over to the boy to comfort him softly.

The baby kicked my suitcase out the door, scattering divorce papers across the floor.

His expression hardened as he scanned the documents: ""Must you cause trouble now? I told you the Johnson family can afford to keep you.""

I silently flipped to specific pages:

""I claim no marital assets, but the jewelry, cars, and properties you gifted me during our courtship are pre-marital property. I'm taking them legally.""

""Sign now,"" I stated coldly, ""or both your children won't be able to register.""

Benjamin's eyes flickered with unease as he pulled me outside, whispering: ""Leave first. Let me calm the children and Sophia before—""

""Sign it."" I thrust the papers into his hand, dusting off my copy. ""We have no 'before' or 'after'.""

He stared at the divorce agreement, knuckles whitening around the pen.

I couldn't help but laugh mockingly at my own words.

""Though you can handle it, why stir up ugly rumors about having an illegitimate child with your mistress, right?""

He calmed down, studying me intently: ""You're sure about giving up being Mrs. Johnson? Seriously?""

I (32M) started dating this alternative goth girl (28F, let's call her Abby) at the end of 2023. We met through my work and instantly realised we had a lot in common and spoke like we'd known each other all our lives. A lot of flirting right from the get go.

I met her family fairly quickly and they loved me. Her mothers words being ""it's about time she met someone decent, I was worried it would never happen"" 
Things went really well for a time.
Then red flags started to pop up. It was simple thints at first. 
Abby would change plans last minute and when I say last minute, I mean like an hour before we were meant to meet up.
We'd go on a date to see a live band or some other event and the two of us would inexplicably become a group because guy friends of hers that often times I'd never heard of and Abby had never mentioned before would just show up to join us out of the blue.
This went on for quite awhile before I finally spoke up and said I wasn't comfortable with the constant plan changes last minute and feeling like a spare part when her ""Friends"" would just turn up.
Abby apologised and said she just liked feeling part of a group. I told her I had no issue with group activities and loved the idea, but not when we're supposed to be on a date together. 
She apologised again and promised she'd stop inviting others along for our dates. 
Now that was the big red flag that pinged in my head.
She had been inviting them along when I had been lead to believe that it was just chance that they turned up. 

Anyway things did get better for quite awhile and it stopped happening. 
Fast forward to August 2024 and she started doing it again. More so than before. 
Random strangers she called friends would join us for lunch out, dinner out or just while we were out on a shopping trip. 
And anytime they did, I was pushed to the background. 

It got really bad. And one day, her best friend. Lets call her Molly. Molly sent me a message to meet up for coffee. What was odd was that she asked to meet just the two of us. When anytime before it had always been Abby, Molly and myself. 

I went for coffee with Molly and I knew I was in for bad news the moment I saw her. 
She hugged me and said she was sorry for what she had to tell me but she couldn't watch me being treated badly anymore. 
She told me that my girlfriend Abby had been inviting these guys along to make them jealous and flirt with them. 
She was using me as a bus stop boyfriend. Someone to be company and emotional and physical support while she went after other people. 
She even showed me messages proving it to be true.
A lot of parts clicked into place.
I thanked Molly for being honest with me and advised she stay out of it for a few days as I didn't want her getting caught in the middle of what was to come and I didn't want her being blamed. 

I went to see Abby that night and had it out with her. 
I let loose a small white lie to protect Molly and told her that a couple of the ""Friends"" she'd had join us before had dropped her in it. I told her I knew everything and I wouldn't stand for being used. 

She tried to defend herself, tried to plead her case. 
But i told her it was too late and we were done and just walked out.

I went full no contact. I don't block people out of principle.
She tried to call many times. Sent me hundreds of messages over the course of months leading up to 2025.
I read them. Never replied. Just ignored it. 
I was hurt as I believed her different. 

By january 2025, I'd pulled myself together and she had stopped trying to contact me. 

End of January, Abby, Molly and I bumped into each other at a live Guns and Roses cover band night. Abby and I spoke a little. 
She asked if we could at least try to talk normally again. 
I hesitantly agreed. 
And we did speak. Over the course of months. 
It seemed she had actually changed. 
The 3 of us. Abby, Molly and myself would often meet up for coffee or lunch and we would laugh and have a good time. 
Things got better. 
And then at he start of June just gone. Abby asked me out on a date. I agreed under the condition that it really was just a date for the two of us. 
We went out, had a great time. Wound up back at hers and fell asleep together on her sofa. 
We went out a lot together after that and quickly got back together. It really felt different and real this time. 

We even started planning a holiday together.

And then last week. It all came crashing down again. 
She bought us tickets to see a band. Said it was just for the 2 of us. 
Then half hour before as I was heading to meet her, she sent a message that others would be joining us. 
My heart fell. 
But I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. Just this once. 
Should have just called it off then and there. 
We went. A couple she knew joined us and I felt a little better. They were really nice people. 
And then I saw the deception. 
She brought them along to keep me occupied. 
She knew the lead singer of the band. 
And the moment her appeared, I became a spare part again and forgotten. 
So I left. 
She had used me again. ",1,1753663153.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I speak now as a man who is defined by clarity. If I had been asked- referencing my definition- a few years ago, I would have hesitated, pondered, perhaps even zoned out in the ether of existentialism; eventually I would reply: Making my son happy.

If you asked me- once more referencing my definition- a few months ago; the words would practically fly from my lips like an uncaged crow: Survival. 

My son was killed by a drunk driver who- by taking my son- took a word from my vocabulary and mutilated it; violated it. Loved. I had to say I loved my son. I couldn’t wake up and look him in the blue marble eyes and smile and say: I love you. That word was taken from me by the last person I’d expect. 

His mother didn’t bother showing up to the funeral: “I don’t want to see my son like that, fucker!” translation: “I don’t have any clothes not stained with cum or soaked in crack smoke, fucker!” And other than me and my father-in-law, the pews were empty.

“Thank you for coming, Immanuel.” His hand was as soft as sandpaper but gentle.

“Of course, Kiddo. This isn’t something you face alone… Sasha not comin’?” His eyes kept mine open, kept them alert. I shook my head and he nodded his. It felt like his hand was glued to my back, keeping a constant, pleasant pressure on my shoulder. The service was short and despite paying for the lecture, I only had one person to eulogize to. 

“He never got to meet you. I’m sorry about that. Just everything with Sasha… I was so bitter. And I didn’t even know you existed till you just kinda… appeared while she was first showing… signs.”

“You don’t need to apologize. It’s not like I’ll never meet him. I’ll end up in the same garden he is. So will you.”

“I think I’m gonna be okay… I just need some time.”

“Well once you’re ready… I’ll call you.” I raised an eyebrow for a frame, but smiled crudely and nodded. I Ubered home- I suppose the driver was typically chatty, but picking up a tear stained man from a funeral house was a hint enough- and tipped the fella 15 bucks for the quality AC.

8 glasses of cinnamon pain killer were enough to get the tears to stop. As I went for a 9th, the first knock came. *Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap.* Through the peep hole I saw a lean white man with slick salt and pepper comb-over. He wore a black suit and tie. I opened the door, expecting a mormon and noticed he now wore glasses too. They were thin and circular. I must have missed them in my hasty once-over of him. I thought he looked better with them anyway so I didn’t pay it much mind. “Y– Yes?”

“Hey neighbor! I just moved in down the way, but the movers won’t have my stuff there till tomorrow. Could I borrow some lunch meat or something?”

“Um…” It was a weird question, but houses aren’t cheap, especially not in my area, so who am I to deny a man tight on cash. “Sure-”

“You look lost.” I was stunned for a moment. “Did you just move here too?” Relief escaped my lungs. My drunken gait was indifferent from a man lost in a new, too-big house. 

“No no… just a little… Little too many stiff ones.” I faked a chuckle and his chuckle followed, even faker than mine. It was oddly reassuring. He faked his laugh to make me feel better about faking mine. I smiled for the second time that day. “Do you wanna come in, get some coffee?”

He took two steps back and looked up at the sky with a sarcastic examination. “My dad always told me to play things safe, but where is the harm in living a little dangerously?” Now I actually chuckled and swung the door wide.

“Coffee at 6, you must be a Knievel.” He walked inside

“One, actually, but I prefer Lou.” And stayed for about 3 hours, sharing stories about his time serving as a missionary and pastor.

“It’s been a while, but Egypt was an oven! You simply cannot escape the heat. I can only imagine it’s worse now with global-warming and all.” *Sip.* “But, I was out there with a dozen of my guys trying to spread the ‘Oh-so-good word’ and help some of these people, but we-” He stifled laughter while he spoke. “We ended up getting chased out by some hippie in a damn curtain!” He practically screamed in laughter and I followed suit. “But, little did he know, I don’t get chased out that easily… Man, it’s getting late. I ought to head home– Thank you. Thank you for humoring an old fool.” He stood up and threw on his jacket.

“Of course. And thank *you,* I needed the laughter.”

“I always provide.” He bowed slightly and I chuffed. “You mind if I come around again, see how much more I can steal from ya?” he giggled and I wheezed.

“Come and take what you want anytime, friend.”

“Well I like your doors, so I’ll start there.” And once more I wheezed in a caffeinated-drunken gigglefit. He stuffed down his laughter and extended his hand for a shake. My hand rose, but was snatched back as my phone rang loudly. 

“Shoot–”

“No worries, get your call, bud. I’ll see ya later!”

I grit my teeth, embarrassed but nodded and waved, before shutting the door and rushing to my phone. “Immanuel?”

“Hey, Kiddo. I just wanted to check in on you.” The velvet gravel voice of Immanuel bucked in my ears and in my motion my stomach twisted to a knot. It felt years had passed since I thought of him- of anything other than booze, coffee, and conversation.

“I- I’m…” The world came back to me. “I’m… better. As *better* as I can be.”

“Good good. I was wondering, and you can say no, if you’d want to come to church with me Sunday?” 

“I- Uh… I don’t know if that’s where I belong. I don’t- I’m not-”

“I’m not asking you to. And, trust me when I say, you need to. But it’ll help.”

I chewed on my cheek. “Alright. Where is it?”

“Don’t worry about that part, I’ll pick you up at 5:30am. Deal?”

“Deal.”

The next day, around 3pm, Lou: *Tap Tap Tap,* then cracked open my door and peered in. I craned my neck, cheeks slightly tear stained as I gripped a photo of my son in Thomas the Tank engine costume me and him had DIY’d for Halloween.

“Hey, Bud… Bad time?”

“No no no… I’m just… thinkin’.”

“What an atrocious sin, oh how hell will punish you.” He cracked a meek smile. 

A humming chuckle rose in my throat but died there as well. He walked in, the suit was a dark shade of red today, nigh-black, and sat next to me on the couch after shutting the door softly. “Your kid?”

“Mhm. Elie. He’s 3 here and I swear he’s the cutest kid ever born.” My stomach dropped and fiery guilt swelled but swiftly died.

“I’d be hard pressed to disagree.”

“I uh, would work for days every October to help him choose what costume he wanted, Then we’d go get the materials and spend a week pouring our hearts into it- till it was perfect. Then he’d go out, and get maybe… 3 pounds candy. Guess how long that bucket would last?”

“2 days.”

“N– Yeah! Without fail! 2 days it’d empty and he’d say the same thing: ‘Never again dad, never again.’ I did everything to make him the happiest he could be. Make him know he was loved.” Gently, so gently I had at first thought the picture floated from my hands, Lou took the picture and stared at it with a distant glimmer in his eye.

“He’s in a better place now.”

Tears flowed again. “I hope so… If I had it my way, he’d be in his room right now, building some skyscraper with his magnet tiles. But, maybe he is. Just not here.” A rock grew in my throat and an opaque haze blurred my vision. “I’m sorry for… all this- can i get you coffee or a sandwich or something?”

“No no… I just wanted to swing by and say hi, I gotta unpack and’ll be at it all day.”

“I could help ya if you need?”

“No, I got a legion on payroll. After they get done doing all the grunt work, I’m gonna put on some blues and decorate till I’ve got no wall space left.”

“How far down the way are you?”

“You know the fork in the road, about a mile or two…” He conjured a mental map, “That way.” He gestured west. “The yellow one. 

“Oh… The manor house?! Wow… you’re *rich* rich.” 

“Yeah, she’s a nice place, no damned AC, but I’ve been through worse than heat.” He tapped the picture with his index finger then opened, and swiftly closed his mouth.

“What?”

“Oh nothing… I was just gonna ask… ask if I can keep this?” He looked queasily at me, embarrassed.

My lip pulled back behind my teeth, then relaxed. “Yeah… I got plenty.” 

He brightened. “Thank you!” He stood up and set his hand on my shoulder. “You were a good dad.”

“Thank y-” I barely remained intact. “Thank you.” And he left.

I went to bed that night with an alarm set for 4:00 so I could wake up, adjust, shower, dress, and get coffee made by 5:15 all to be ready by 5:30 for Immanuel. REM came quicker than usual and similarly, left quicker than typical. 

*Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap*

2:52am, the clock on my nightstand blared in red dashes. I sat up- floaty headed- and lurched towards the door out of my bedroom; sluggishly traveled down the hall, shambled down the stairs, and peeped through the peep hole. Lou stood facing away from the door in a maroon suit. I swung it open and was met with his smile, he had been facing the door; hadn’t he.

“Lou?” I grunted.

“Moses! I’m glad you’re up. May I come in?”

I hesitated, confused. “Ye- yeah, of course.” As he entered, I spotted that he held the picture of Elie in his hand. 

“I need to talk to you, my friend. Sit.”

“What’s up?” I said, more awake now.

“What I’m about to say… it’s gonna sound weird.”

“What?”

He rolled his tongue along his lips.”You’re son. How did he die?”

“Wha-”

“How did he die?”

“Don’t ask me tha-”

“Moses.” His face lost all luster and kindness.

“When the car… spun out: the back passenger seat slammed in a pole and… he was– Why are you asking me this!?”

Lou answered swiftly. “Who was the drunk driver that day?”

“No… please no.”

“Who?”

I began to weep. “Me… I had gotten… and I thought I could manage… but the rain… I lost control.” Lou dove to my feet, his hands cupping my face and directing my eyes towards his.

“Shush, shush… it’s okay, it’s okay. Look at me. I know the pain you feel. All too well. And- and… can help you. I can bring him back.”

“Wh-”

“I’ve done it before, brought people back from the other side. Myself a time. You can see Elie again. Have Elie again. all yours, like before.”

“How– No, no! It’s not right.”

“It’s perfectly right, because it’s what you want. Here.” His index finger tapped my heart. “I know, because I know it all.”

“How?”

“You just have to ask.”

“That’s… That’s it?” Lou nodded. My lips trembled and my body quaked. “Can you bring my son back?”

“Yes.” His hand rose, and so did mine. It glided forward then recoiled as my phone rang up the stairs. I turned to face Lou and he shrugged. “Now or never.” Without a thought, my hand swam forward, and shook his. “Congrats my friend. All things are how they should be.” My racing heart eased its pace and we both smiled. “Better go get that call.” He chuffed.

I dashed up the stairs, all hope and joy and passion reignited. Love came back to vocabulary. I raised the phone to my ear. “Hello?” I chirped.

“Why did you shake his hand?” Immanuel sobbed.

“What? Immanuel- what’s wrong?”

“I told you we’d see him in the garden someday. Did you want it that bad? Was it worth your soul?”

“What?”

“You could have saved yourself… I made you to be wise… how could you think so little?” And the call ended.

“Moses… He’s back.” He shouted. *Lou* shouted. Lou One. Low One. I dashed downstairs, tripping halfway down and riding my spine to the ground. I scrambled up and panned my gaze to Lou. Elie stood beside him, eyes wet with tears. “Say: Hi, Elie.”

“No!” I wailed, cascading to my knees.

“Yes…” I fell to my side and wept against the planks. “Get up Moses. You don’t have much time.” I clambered to my knees and crawled into the living room.

“Elie.” I sniffled.

“Dad?” Elie murmured. “Are you okay?”

“No…” I broke down again. 

“Moses… Look at me.” He knelt to my side and pulled me to my knees. “You have 10 minutes. Heaven will only let him be out here for 10. Short. Minutes. Mo. You already paid, no point in crying. Spend this well okay?” His voice was new. It was slicker and polished. It was soft. It was kind. He removed his pocket square and cleaned off my face of the water works. 

I shuddered toward Elie who smiled now that my complexion was less glum. “How are you, Buckshot?”

“Good, Dad! I've been at this pretty garden with Immanuel. There are all these fruits that I didn’t even know existed!” His smile was as bright as the day I lost him. His voice as innocent and curious as everyday he’d woken up. 

“That’s amazing…” We talked for what felt like an eternity with an end. Each minute felt like some grand and critical part of the world was falling away, but also: that it was used to its fullest before its loss. He told me of relatives he met and friends he had made. He spoke of the food and the music. The wings in the sky. 

“I can’t wait for you to see it, Dad.” Some part of me knew, but a glance to Lou confirmed it. 

“It’ll be a while before I do… But, I’m sure the wait will be worth it.” I held my son as the last lie I’d ever tell him fell away from my mouth. His warmth grew then dulled. Lou walked to my side, Elie’s soft skin becoming gritty as whatever he was made of turned to dust on the furniture.

It broke back out, tears cleaning and dragging away spots of the dust. “I’m sorry Mo. I really am.”

“You’re a fucking liar.”

“The worst part is: I can’t be… I’m not allowed to not do… this to people. Most of the time, I enjoy it. I get to look evil souls in the face as they come to understand. But, cases like these… I wish I didn’t have to.”

“What do you mean?”

“I wish you could know.” His cheeks became wet. “I’m so sorry, I was begging you’d say no… Goodbye, Mo. I’m moving today.” And he left. 

Clarity fills me now. Of definitions I’ve given myself, this one is- unironically- the clearest. I have been given a profound understanding of how many things are watching everything you do. How many things cheer and jeer. How little they lie. That’s the part that still hurts. More than any other. 

Demons lie, and they fail because of it. But, the Devil will give you nothing but the truth, and that's why he will always get you. They call him the king of lies, but not once, not with me or any other human past, present, or future; has he ever lied. 

He smiles, dresses well. Smells of honey and speaks so compassionately. He’s gentle and kind- so, so, so kind. His face is never the same, but it’s always only his. He will look like you least expect, but most enjoy. He will ask for little things, and soon he’ll ask for everything; and you’ll give it to him. 

You only have one hope. If you hear a knock (3 taps, 3 times) on your door and  the man on the other side of the door is dressed in a deep red suit that could almost be mistaken as black, don't answer.

She showed up at my door three days later and changed everything.,"So on Valentine’s Day, I ordered flowers for this girl I’d been kind of seeing. Nothing super serious, but I thought it’d be a nice gesture. Just something small.

I was in a rush and typed her address too fast. Didn’t even notice I mixed up two numbers in her apartment. Hit place order and went on with my day. Got the delivery confirmation a couple hours later but no text. No thank you, no these are beautiful nothing. Just silence.

Next day, still nothing. By day three, I figured alright, cool, guess that’s over. Kinda sucked but whatever. Then someone knocked on my door.

This woman’s standing there with the flowers in her hands. I didn’t recognize her at first.

She goes, Hey these showed up at my place. I almost threw them out but they were too pretty. Figured I’d try to get them to the right person. I was like Oh. Wow. Yeah. Those were for someone who didn’t really answer.

She smiled and said, Their loss.

And then, before leaving she kinda laughed and said, “You’ve got good taste though. If you ever need help picking out flowers again, I’m right down the hall.”

I stood there like an idiot holding these now very awkward flowers thinking… did that just happen?

Next day I sent her a new bouquet. Just some simple yellow tulips with a note that said

Thought you deserved your own.

That afternoon, she slid a sticky note under my door. It said

Do you send flowers to all your neighbors or was I just lucky?

We ended up grabbing coffee that weekend. Talked for like two and a half hours without even realizing it. Then we did it again. And again.

Now it’s almost a year later. We’re still together. She still teases me about not knowing how to type an address. I still get her tulips every once in a while, especially when I have no idea what else to do.

We've both been with our respective partners this whole time, except recently, he cheated on his ex of 4 years and they broke up, and I broke up with my partner of 2 years after a really hairy pregnancy scare. At this point we'd met twice before for lunch and coffee, strictly platonically. 

However, after our breakups, he paid for a beach trip for me and him, to Myrtle, where things turned more towards FWB. After that, we've since been hiking together 3 times, 2 instate and 1 out of state - his first time hiking - and he fell in love with the activity.

We harbor 0 feelings for each other and have both fully agreed that this is just a platonic, sometimes sexual relationship that we both cherish. 

I asked him recently if he'd go out of state with me (as in different coast type out of state), to hike - and he agreed. However when I brought up AZ and the Grand Canyon, he told me that was wife type activities, and that he needed to save that for his future wifey - ergo he's also told me he doesn't plan on dating for at least another two years - similar with myself though who knows. 

He also told me, if his future partner wishes, he'd likely break off our friendship as its turned partially sexual. I told him I'd rather go back to straight platonic, if it meant losing his friendship but he said that the damage has been done and we'll have to see where the future leads.

I know, after much introspection, I truly have no feelings for this man and I do believe that it is also mutual on his behalf. But he is standing by limiting our hikes now (which really saddens me because its an activity I introduced him to, and I was so ecstatic to have someone to share this with now), for a reason I just can't understand. He's single. He's never so much as batted an eye about hiking before and was actually initially quite adverse to it. I don't understand why the Grand Canyon, which he never cared for, is now an off limits activity. 

Furthermore, I also don't understand the mentality of dropping a several year long friendship for a new woman. Who is in this case, completely hypothetical. Honestly, my feelings are hurt and I've tried bringing this up with him, but he couldn't see my side and just got frustrated. I'm scared to reopen this conversation because I don't want him to think I'm being possessive, or pushing boundaries - I'm just really confused and upset.

He got out at the start of July and said that he had to focus on his sobriety right now but he wants to be friends. We’ve tried to plan to meetup a few times but our schedules haven’t lined up. I still have some of his stuff to give him. 

Well we finally managed to find a time to get together and are finally meeting up tomorrow but now my head is spiralling. Will he look at me and think wow I really must’ve been drunk what the hell was I thinking? Will we not get along now that he’s sober? My brain is cycling through all the worst case scenarios of meeting up and my insecurities are coming out big time. He had suggested last week that he come to my house and now he’s asked to just get coffee so now I’m wondering if he wants a quick out or if he’s also just nervous. 

Have any of you reconnected with your Q after some time apart and it go positively? Did it end as bad as maybe you thought it might? ",1,1753662720.0,AlAnon,1,0.66,False

1mb2608,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mb2608/my_30m_girlfriend_29f_says_she_doesnt_think_shes/,My (30M) girlfriend (29F) says she doesn't think she's romantically attracted to me. Can I save this?,"First I'd like to state, I know the title sounds stupid, obviously 99% of the time a situation like this cannot be saved. That being said there are more details that I think paint a better picture. My girlfriend and I dated for about a year and a half 3 years ago. I fell so madly in love with her the second I met her. She has the exact same sense of humor as me, the same mannerisms, the same interests, everything. I had never felt such a strong and instant feeling of being fully in love with someone in my life, and I have been in multiple committed multi year relationships before. She was different. Last time, our relationship struggled a lot because we are both alcoholics, and both of our lives had been completely ruined by the pandemic. We ended up having quite a messy end, where my drinking and anxious attachment made me toxic, and her avoidant attachment, and drinking, turned it into a situation where every time we spoke, she was annoyed, I was on the brink of tears, basically begging for any sort of validation of her feelings for me. I completely locked down after her, I felt like I had lost the love of my life. I put up walls and avoided any sort of relationship, or even most dating, ever since, because my love for her was still so strong in my heart.

Fast forward to last summer. I had a very close near death experience due to a medical condition. There was a non zero chance I was going to die. I still thought about her almost daily, but had already made ""peace"" with the idea I would never see her again. She was in another relationship, and had surely forgotten about me I thought. Well, on my literal deathbed all I saw was her face when I closed my eyes. I texted her. Not telling her I was dying, but just to let her know that I was sorry for how everything ended, and how I hope that she was doing okay, and that she was happy, and that I was thinking about her. She did not text me back, but about 3 months later I randomly got a call from her at about 9pm on a Friday night. We talked for about 4 hours on the phone, catching up with each others lives, telling stories, laughing, reminiscing. We are both in recovery from alcohol at that point, so we really had a lot to talk about. Months go by, and were talking on the phone for hours and hours every single day. She lives about 100 miles and a boat ride away from me, so seeing each other isnt as easy as just going to get coffee. 

Around new years, we made a plan. I'm a mechanic, and she wanted someone to take a look at her car. It was really just an excuse to see each other. She got on the boat and drive 2 and a half hours up to see me. It was great. We made plans for the next weekend. That weekend came and that she stayed at my house, we slept together I was the happiest I had been in years. We started dating again almost instantly. She told me she had learned to deal with a lot of her anger, and was happy to be with me again. It was beautiful for about 4 months. She told me she still loved me, and I later opened up about my true feelings about still loving her. It was beautiful. It was the best parts of our last relationship, with none of the bad. 

Then one day it happened. I went to hold her hand, on admittedly a pretty hot day, when she was already frustrated at something else, and she pulled away, told me to back off. It was all downhill from there. Later she told me she thought I was smothering her, and that she was overwhelmed by me. She said she needed space. I gave that to her, but she still called every day, so I answered. Then a few weeks later, she said she wanted a break, I said okay, and gave that to her. She told me flat out she was struggling to be attracted to me. I gave her that break.  She came to see me for the first time in a month a few days ago, and I replaced some parts on her car, took her out to dinner, took her shopping, really wined and dined her, and she looked so happy. Then later that night in bed, she recoiled at my touch again. I rolled over and went to sleep, trying not to spiral. She left in the morning. 

  
Today, she is on the way home from a friends house about 500 miles from where she lives, so we spoke on the phone for about 10 straight hours until she got home. Our conversations sometimes get philosophical, and we spoke about what love really means and what it is. Then she hits me with ""I think im about to drop a bomb on you"" and states, in a very matter of fact, and not nice way, ""I love you, but I dont think I've ever been in love with you, and I think I'm not romantically interested in you, and I'm not sure I ever have been"". I asked what the meant, and what it meant for us. She said she needed to think about it. I started to spiral a little and she started to get annoyed, so I asked if she wants to talk about something else. We spoke for about another 30 minutes about random shit, making jokes, pretending that conversation didnt happen, but meanwhile I'm on the inside, and later on the outside, balling my eyes out. Feeling betrayed, stupid, and lonely. All I can think about is how on my deathbed, all I thought about was her, and I'm worried that it will always be that way, and my anxious attachment ruined the one chance I was going to get. I dont know what her endgame is. She did not dump me. I just dont know where to go from here, what to do. I dont want to give up on her, on this dream that I have, and I know she has been happy, and doesnt mean what she says, but she will never admit that. I just really would love to hear from someone who has been down this road, and what were the outcomes? I know attraction and romantic intentions change over time, but I dont know what I'm expecting here.

Any advise at all is really appreciated. Obviously I'm really hoping someone will give me hope, but I'm unfortunately not an idiot, just a wishful thinker. Maybe I need to give her more space? Set the boundary of ""you asked for space, and youre still calling, take your space and stop calling?"".

1mb2577,https://www.reddit.com/r/Billings/comments/1mb2577/nursing_in_billings_for_ihs/,Nursing in Billings for IHS,"Hey everyone!

I’m considering moving to Billings, MT on a contract with the Indian Health Service (IHS), and I’d love to hear from anyone with experience in the area.. whether you’ve worked with IHS, lived in Billings, or both.

This is a really exciting opportunity for me professionally, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t feeling a bit nervous. I’d appreciate any insight, advice, or even just honest perspectives on a few things:

Safety: 
I’ve heard mixed things about safety in Billings. Some say it’s fine, others say certain parts can be rough. Are there neighborhoods you’d recommend for someone new to town? Areas to avoid? I’ll likely be living alone, so personal safety is a big one for me.

Weather: 
I know Montana winters can be brutal compared to where we are from. I’ve never had to deal with snow on a daily basis—how hard is the adjustment really? How do people typically prep their homes and cars?

Moving is always a little intimidating. Is the community in Billings pretty welcoming to newcomers? Are there any good social groups, gyms, or activities where it’s easier to meet people? My fiancé and I absolutely love the outdoors (hiking, backpacking, fitness), finding small restaurants, breweries & coffee shops on our off time. (Bonus if you know of any for healthcare workers!)

Working with IHS:
I’d love to hear any feedback from nurses or medical professionals who have worked with IHS—specifically in Billings or even elsewhere in Montana. What should I expect? Is the pace manageable? Any challenges or unexpected positives?

Also, if anyone has any insight on working as a paramedic in MT. My fiancé is currently a firefighter/paramedic here but wants to move out of fire when we get out there. 

I really want to make the most of this opportunity, and I’m hoping to go into it as informed and prepared as possible. Thanks so much in advance for any input!",1,1753662600.0,Billings,4,0.67,False
1mb22yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/InkWielder/comments/1mb22yb/update_of_the_month/,Update of the Month,"Hey everybody! That time again.

I know nobody asks for these, so I'm sorry to clog your feeds, I just like to keep you up to date in case you're wondering were the next parts of your favorite series are. If this isn't important to you, then I apologize, and promise that this one should cover the next couple months, so don't worry.

# General Progress Update (Abyss/Litany)

If you saw the last post I made, Lost in Litany is on a brief hiatus until I finish Abyss, which if my math is right, shouldn't be too many more parts before she's done and over. I'm hoping by the end of August we'll be back to it.

Speaking of Abyss, some of you who have been following my updates each week probably noticed that I didn't post on schedule last Sunday, and I apologize for that. I had been suffering some pretty bad burnout as well as some personal things that was keeping my motivation down, and I just didn't finish that chapter when I meant to. The plan was to get it out the next day or midway through the week, as I thought the break would help me get that motivation back, but, well... here we are a week later, and I'm barely farther now than I was then.

So, I'd like to issue a formal apology to everyone for keeping you waiting. I really hate making these kind of posts and letting down everyone who's giving my silly little posts on the internet their valuable time. Over the years, I've grown very particular about my writing, and while I know I could force myself to sit down and crank out what I need to, I never feel like the quality will be there, and I always want you all to read the best I can give you when I post. Every time I've sat down this week to write, that's how it's been feeling :/

This week, though, I'll be locking back in on my writing and trying to pace myself so that I can make sure I'll have a chapter out for you all next Sunday. I'm pretty excited for the next beats of the story after this part, so I'm sure once we get over this hump, it'll be some pretty smooth sailing. given how much shorter the chapters are for this series compared to my others, I may even shake up the upload schedule and try to get two out for you all in a week at some point, God willing haha.

# Future stuff:

also had a couple ideas for some one part stories that I may try to fill the space with when I need small break from writing a main story, so keep an eye out if I get to those. For those of you who read ""Flashlight Goggles"" before it got removed, I'd really like to return to that very soon as it was an idea I was very fond of. There's at least two other shorties' that I'm pretty excited to get to.

Depending on how steady the writing for Litany is going once I return to that (I promise it'll take priority like I said in my last post), I may try and have another mini-series out for winter time. I had the idea for a ""snowy"" horror story last year, but missed the window before winter was nearly over, so figured I'd see if I can squeeze it in this November-January. Like I said, though, that's only if I'm satisfied with the amount of work I'm getting done on Litany, so no promises just yet!

# Supporting Me:

I've had a surprising amount of people recently asking if there's any place that you guys could show you support for my work financially. I say surprising because I never really imagined getting to a point where I'd have an audience that enjoys my writing so much they'd want to pay for it. You all have no idea how encouraging that is for me to see as a writer, and it really does give me hope that someday I'll be able to make a job out of this.

So, how *can* you support me? Well, as of right now, there isn't a lot of ways, unfortunately. If you've been with me for a while, you'll know I'm not the best at managing accounts or social media, and I'm also not super well read on a lot of different sites and apps, haha.

I've never gotten a Patreon because from what I understand it's a sort of subscription thing, and you're supposed to have rewards for different tiers of supporters. I don't feel that I'm able to put out enough content to justify allowing you all to spend money on me month after month, but maybe I'll look into it more to see if that's accurate. I'm also looking into Buy Me a Coffee, as I'm pretty sure that one is just a simple way to donate any amount of money you all feel justified with.

Point is, I'm looking into it, and I'll have an more consistent way to support my work soon, hopefully!

In the meantime, however, you can also support me by buying a physical copy of ""It's Somewhere Beneath Us"" if you haven't already, [linked here](https://a.co/d/6Ou2sBV).

If you haven't read it yet, it's most of my audience's favorite work of mine, so I'm sure you'll enjoy it too if you like my other stuff. You can find the free original upload on my profile too if you want to read it before making that decision! If you do choose to buy one, leaving a 5 star review also really helps with the Amazon algorithm, I'm told. or just tell your friends! Anything helps.

Most of all, though, you can support me by just continuing to read and follow my works :) Nothing has kept me going more than all of your guys' support and feedback, and I'm not joking when I say that these last few years of my writing journey has been some of the most rewarding years of my life thanks to all of you. My numbers may seem small compared to the greats, but seeing even just the handful of comments each upload, and seeing the likes and upvotes I get on my works really is unmatched encouragement to keep going.

Sorry again to have nothing for you all this week, but thank you so much as always for always sticking by my side.

More for you soon, I promise,

* Do they both use the same size paper filter?

* Does the paper filter work better or worse on one side vs the other? (I guess in regard to leaks and things.)

* Can you adjust the recipe? 

Re: last question. I currently have a pitcher with a metal cylinder filter and due to the shapes, it needs x amount of water and coffee to saturate the grounds evenly. That’s pretty annoying when I want to make a different amount.

The OXO seems much more flexible, closer to making cb in a mason jar. Just want to make sure that’s the case, as the default recipe for the large one seems like too much, and the default for the compact seems like too little lol",1,1753662399.0,coldbrew,2,1.0,False

1. Knowle (5 min walk from The Knowle pub) - cheaper, seems to have better amenities but a little worried about grocery stores and food options close by (didnt see anything except the Tesco Extra which is a 15-20 min walk)

2. Arnos Vale (Bath road) - a little too close to my budget, but seems to have better transport links to city centre and close to Avonmeads but less shared facilities.

Basically I would love some more information to help me decide on the area because I really like both places. I'm looking for any info on - Liveliness, community events (non religious), security and crime rates (especially how safe it is at night or early morning), good coffee places and food options too. 

Just wanted to mention that I will mostly be using the bus and will be travelling around Bristol for work so want to know which has better transport links, also I would love to be close to community spaces where you can hang out and socialise without spending too much.

We are all mid to late 20s and finishing up various masters degrees as well as work full time. One of the roommates is disabled. 

Landlord came by the house recently and made a fuss about how messy the house is,, we had just cleaned the place so it really wasnt that messy and i asked him to elaborate and he said we had ""too much clutter"" .. the clutter mind you was.. books and plants and dog treats on the mantel and stuff on OUR coffee table (not trash, like mail and a box of dog toys). I could understand if he walked in and it was disgusting like food and trash everywhere,, but its literally like items that belong to us?? And it feels weird and like micromanaging... can a landlord even bother us about it?? He was making a fuss like he would try to evict us over it. He didnt say those words directly but it was heavily implied...

He also keeps making a stink about the yard. We pay someone to come cut the grass because two of us work full time and are hardly home, and the other is disabled. The landlord has also NEVER kept up the yard. Two roommates have lived here for a few years and even when they moved in the flower beds had so many weeds like tall and thick like trees. The place needs landscaping, and he expects us to do it and pay for it when he never did it before we moved in. Again, i pay professionals to come cut the yard and edge and stuff and he told me that they really need to also be raking. 

But raking is IMPOSSIBLE because the area he wants raked is above ground tree roots ?????? Like for two massive trees in the front yard (magnolias to be exact) the other roommates have tried to rake previously and it took them 3-4 hours and it still looked like it didnt do anything

Am I overreacting for being pissed about this??? He always has something negative to say and even asked where the other working roommate is gone to all the time (which is none of his business) i honestly think he thinks we just sit on our ass all day or party or something instead of being 3 working professionals.. which we've told him multiple times.

* Unlocked device
* Battery powered or direct USB ""high power"" mode
* Female velcro on back for mounting (I could try to remove if preferred)
* Ethernet and USB C ports

Before this, I had a Nighthawk M1; these are great devices. I only upgraded to this to get those super speedy 5G brainwaves.

Although it says AT&T, it's an unlocked device. It should work with any major carrier. You just pop in a SIM with a data plan. It should work abroad, too, with a foreign SIM.

Fun fact: the AT&T, or ""pro,"" version is faster than the retail M6. It is mmWave capable, meaning you can utilize the fastest 5G networks available. It really enhances your Bill Gates' microchip performance.

At the time I was about 144-146 lbs and I had gained about 10 lbs over the course of 2 years. This doesn’t sound like a lot but as we know for my height it’s pretty noticeable. I never thought a bit of a weight fluctuation due to stress eating would lead to pre-diabetes. I was finishing up college during that time so I was on the go, commuting an hour, eating out more, drinking more since I lived up at college for bit, not exercising, etc. I had always been pretty fit but getting to the finish line to get my degree put fitness in the back burner. Finding out that I was in the prediabetic range freaked me out so I started IF, walking 10,000 steps a day, cutting back on sweets, sweet coffee(started drinking it black which was tough LOL), and ate mostly pescatarian for a while. By January I was at 134. I don’t think I started losing weight until December. I kinda fell off for a bit and was stuck between 133-136 since I started a new but stressful job and was mostly sedentary but I kept up with a good diet as much as I could. Over the past month or so, (I quit my job wooo) I’ve been able to focus on my health a bit more again and I’m back at a solid 129-131.

I’m Mike, 20, and I’m hungry to get hands-on experience on real sets in Europe this summer or fall. I’m open to anything, from PA, runner, coffee guy, C47 guy, whatever gets me in and learning the ropes.

I’m not in film school, have been a part of local productions in my country but I’m dead serious about building a career in this industry. I’ll show up early, stay late, and do what needs doing to keep the set moving. I speak fluent English (C1), I’m based in Europe and willing to travel for the right opportunity.

If you know of any productions that need a hand, I’d love a shot to prove myself. Even tips, leads, or ways to plug into crews would mean the world. Feel free to drop a comment or DM me.

I’ve sent out cold emails, called around and most replies have been slow or flat-out rejections, also there ain't no local productions for almost 2 years by now. So I figured I’d ask here and reach out to the people actually doing the work.

1mb1vvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/1mb1vvy/are_sick_passengers_routinely_allowed_to_fly_if/,Are sick passengers routinely allowed to fly if they’re knowingly sick prior to takeoff?,"I took a flight last week where there was a sick passenger allowed to fly. 

In the TSA line, this passenger was throwing up in a coffee tumbler, and a TSA employee walked him through the security line because he was so ill. I saw this same passenger at my gate sitting with his head down and hood up. He then boards the plane, and prior to takeoff he throws up in a bag TWICE in his seat, and the flight attendants kept coming up to him and brining him bags. Prior to takeoff, he was told to stay in his seat no matter what due to safety. For the ENTIRE FLIGHT he was dry heaving and puking into a bag. He was the row ahead of my and it was so so brutal. He looked deathly ill and I was nervous having him this sick with no medical attention if needed. 

My question is - why was he allowed to fly if he was knowing sick both at the airport and before takeoff? To expect those around him to just sit back and ignore it is insane. Plus I felt with was a huge health and safety issue. The flight was out of Nashville so maybe they thought he was just hungover? Regardless, all the patrons in the flight near him were very uncomfortable. 

AITA for thinking this was so inappropriate?

1mb1vb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/romantasycirclejerk/comments/1mb1vb6/a_mainstream_romantasy_authors_entirely_unbiased/,A Mainstream Romantasy Authors’ Entirely Unbiased Guide to Permissible Fae Realms,"You’re new to being a Romantasy author, and you might not know these things. So we, here, at HarperPenguinSchuster, are here to guide you: 


First of all, we must have our heroine, who is human. She was born poor, and scrappy– she’s not used to luxury. She’s sassy. She has moxie. And spunk*. Also spirit. She’s not like the other girls. Like, dresses, whut? Amirite? She had to learn how to fight as a result of her scrappy upbringing. She has auburn hair, which signifies that she is Different, and also is a nice comfy way to let us all know that she’s white without having to actually say so. She might have freckles. Despite her poor upbringing, she loves books— I mean, she’s always read those two dog-eared books to death. When she first sees a proper library… oh, wow. 

**Our first fae realm** couldn’t possibly be a bad Ren Faire version of medieval England, of course not. It’s just coincidence that it’s full of stuffy royalty and reserved nobility concerned about the line of succession, jewels, fancy balls, backstabbing courts and fancy castles, peasants and dragon lore. And it’ll be really cute to throw in Celtic-coded names and erratic allusions to Celtic mythology randomly!! It’s not like there’s anything political about a not-English monarchy playing with not-Irish and not-Scottish traditions! ✨Our MMC might be from here, with his thicc thighs and his tortured, heaving chest. He just murders people because of how mean his father is to him, OK? It’s hard* to be a prince.

**The second court**, the other place from which our MMC may most likely be from, is definitely not coded as faux Viking; they’re definitely not from the sea, wearing a lot of fur capes with their broad chests bared, tattoos snaking down to–where?, battle-hungry, looking for plunder* with names that make gratuitous use of the ümlaüt and absolutely, definitely no use of runes, no ma’am. Definitely no eyes that are blue like the stormy oceans themselves. He kills because he’s a tortured warrior, OK.

**The third court**, if we get that far, is almost always not fairy all-of-Asia since, like, a whole continent can be a court if it’s “foreign” enough (to you, the author)! You might encounter kawaii-type details on female characters– they’re just a little more cute and sweet !! You might hear about blossom festivals, jasmine, jade, precise deadly warrior arts, about hierarchy and deeply philosophical – but ! sometimes quite funny! side characters. There are many different ways to do subtle *and* not subtle racisms; it’s a delight that this genre is exploding* and that the market for books like this have yet to reach a climax!  Our MMC is almost certainly not from here, though. We won’t talk about why? But just… not, OK? Perhaps a visiting princess, though, of the blooming cherry blossoms.

**The fourth court**, if we are lucky enough to get one might be ~ hot ~ and it might be “exotic” and desert-y, there will be silks. There might be saffron! And pomegranates!! It could be Morocco or Iran! It might be just a little bit Egyptian, with pillowy bread, and vague allusions to hieroglyphs and kohl but not, you know, falafel. But there will be lots of broad. sweating. desert. chests. (They might be “golden brown” or “the color of sand.” There may be other, minor characters– possibly female– whose skin is “shining ebony” but our MMC will more likely look up from the dark pool of his eyes, his tortured soul, as his sand-colored skin glistens in the sun. Yearning.)

There will probably not be Fae Not-Latin America or Fae Not-Subsaharan Africa. (The Marketing Department said we already had enough “spice”* *sips iced coffee*)

There could be Fae France! though. Or Fae Italy. The Continent, we’ll call it, and/or The South. Those have tested really well with our focus groups.  

*that’s what she said

Had someone ask if I could post about my upcoming events since they're not on IG, so here's what I've got planned for next week! 

This week is all about Big Sur, a Chinese roaster out of Shanghai that is one of my favorites right now. It's a very light roast, but it's more expressive than other coffees at the same level of development. 

On Friday at 11:30, we'll be cupping 10 different coffees from them, including some Esmeralda and a Nuguo gesha that was one of the pricier coffees I've featured. Good way to try a lot of fun coffee at a reasonable price! 

Here's the link to reserve: https://partiful.com/e/3nHHNGyVvDvxa5iH03dk

It's $15/person. You pay through venmo for this, but if you don't have venmo, feel free to shoot me a dm. It's pretty easy for me to invoice through my site :)

Then on Saturday, we're doing a tasting. This one is kinda pricey due to the coffees we're featuring. We'll be tasting 4x different Panama geshas. With the cupping, you really just get a spoonful or 2 of each coffee, but at the tasting you'll get a mini pourover of each of the coffees (hence the price difference!)

Here's the link for that one:

https://partiful.com/e/0t8PhRNSLFzBYtQlgxJ1

This is for the 11:30 seating. If it sells out, I'll edit it with a link for the 12:30 seating! If tastings aren't your thing but you still want to stop by for a pourover, I'll be brewing coffee for walk ups from 1:30 - 4pm after the tastings! I'll have some of the geshas available and a lot of more affordable (but equally delicious!) Ethiopian and Kenyan coffees from Big Sur to try out!

Most of the info is in the links, but here's our address: 2103 3rd Ave, Seattle, WA 98121. We are in the unmarked garage at this address. Knock and I'll let you in :)

Feel free to dm with any questions :) I'll post my full month schedule soon! Just finalizing some deets. But I'll have a lot of options at lots of different price points! Hope to see some of you there!",4,1753661405.0,PNWcoffee,2,1.0,False

So lets say im looking for a decent school, i go to the education tab => schools and see all the listed school and reviews people made (same concept if you're looking for coffee, parks, sightseeing etc.. )

It will also provide services, people can upload their notes / books / exams in the education tab , it will be filtered (school , uni , major or subject) . (still thinking about more services to add i need suggestions)

People can also list their skills , a plumber can list his skills and phone number and where he operates so he can find clients for example and so on .   
  
And it is connected to reddit so if anyone has a question it will be posted here.   
  
The last thing it will provide is some facts and historical information about the culture and country .

Hi… not sure if I’m in the wrong here but I feel really awful and just want some outside perspective.

I (20F) have been with Damien (30M) for a little over a year. I know the age gap seems a lot, but he’s been nothing but generous and kind to me. He has his own company, he’s successful, and honestly he changed my life. He let me move in, got me out of a really unstable situation, and even gave me a job with his team. I know I’m lucky.

Last week, he invited me to his team’s client dinner. It was a big deal fancy restaurant, important people, lots of wine and suits. I wore this red dress he helped me pick out a few weeks ago. I felt pretty. Like, really pretty. He told me I looked amazing when we left the house, held my hand in the car, everything felt good.

At the table, I was nervous but trying to be confident. People were laughing and chatting, and I was trying to fit in. At one point, someone asked how we met, and I made a light joke and said, “He basically hired me and then realized I’m cute too.” Everyone laughed, it wasn’t dirty or anything it was just playful.

But he didn’t laugh. He kind of smiled, tight, then got really quiet. The rest of the night he barely looked at me. In the car, he just said, “You don’t know when to keep your mouth shut sometimes.” That hurt. I apologized but chuckled saying it wasn’t that big of a deal but he really didn’t like it and just drove and we had a huge argument the whole ride home I ended up up crying(I’m very emotional and sensitive so yeah)

Ever since, he’s been different. Cold. Polite but distant. At work, it’s strictly professional. At home, he’s quiet. He still pays for things, still buys me coffee, but the warmth is gone. I asked if he’s mad and he said “It’s not a big deal. Just think before you speak next time.”

I feel like I embarrassed him. I didn’t mean to. I honestly thought I was being charming. I’ve never been to events like that before. I’m still figuring this stuff out.

Some friends say he overreacted and I didn’t do anything wrong. Others say I should’ve known better, that I crossed a line in a professional setting.

So… AITA for making a small joke at a work dinner that might’ve embarrassed my boyfriend?

I’m planning a long-awaited trip to Japan this October, and I’d love some advice on my itinerary as I’m getting but overwhelmed 🫣

My partner (35F) and I (30F) are flying into Tokyo in early October. She’ll fly out of Osaka on Day 14, and I’ll continue solo for another two weeks after that.

I love nature, history, wandering around, cute coffee shops, and autumn vibes. My partner is up for anything — her only request is to visit Ghibli Park.

	•	Tokyo – 4 nights
	•	Kamakura – 1 night
	•	Hakone – 1 night
	•	Nagoya – 2 nights (Ghibli Park visit)
	•	?? – 2 nights → looking for advice!
	•	Kyoto – 3 nights

⸻

✨ Solo Part:
	•	Koyasan – 3 nights 
	•	Kyoto as a base — exploring at a slower pace with day trips like:
	•	Uji
	•	Kurama–Kibune hike
	•	Soni Highlands or Oishi Kogen
	•	Enryaku-ji Temple
	•	Or any other gems you’d recommend!

# Sample Chapters (1-3 excerpt):

**Prologue: Behind the Smile**

On a sunny Saturday afternoon, the Matthews family hosted their annual neighborhood barbecue. Karen Matthews stood in the backyard, perfectly coiffed hair catching the light, her laughter bright and warm as she circulated among neighbors. Her children, Emma and Jake, played nearby — Emma, lively and outspoken, Jake, charming and polite. From the outside, the Matthews looked like an ideal family: successful, happy, united.

But behind the smiles and meticulously arranged picture frames, something deeper lurked — a web of invisible roles, silent battles, and wounds yet to heal.

**Chapter 1: The Perfect Facade**

Karen Matthews knew how to command attention. Whether at work or social events, people hung on her every word. She was charismatic, confident, and relentless in pursuit of admiration. Those qualities made her successful, yes, but they also fueled a darker need — to control the world around her, especially her family.

At home, Karen ruled as both queen and judge.

Her oldest daughter, Emma, was bright but “too emotional,” too “defiant” in Karen’s eyes. When Emma cried after a disagreement, Karen stiffened, her face cold. “Stop making such a scene,” she’d snap. “You’re embarrassing me.”

Jake, two years younger, was different. Quiet in his obedience, careful to earn praise. And Karen lavished it on him. “Jake, you’re so talented,” she’d say proudly. “You could do anything with that kind of discipline.”

Outsiders rarely glimpsed the tension between the siblings — and never the storm of words behind closed doors.

**Chapter 2: Roles Are Cast**

The lines were drawn early.

Emma’s every misstep was amplified. Spilled milk became a catastrophe; a loud tantrum was proof she was “out of control.” She was labeled “the drama” and “the problem.”

Jake’s achievements, however small, were heralded as evidence of Karen’s perfect parenting. Karen whispered to Jake, “You have to be the one who succeeds. Better than Emma.”

A subtle rivalry rooted not in sibling rivalry but in Karen’s need for heroes and scapegoats grew between them, though it was masked by forced smiles and occasional shared laughter.

**Chapter 3: The Label and the Medicine**

Emma was seven when Karen took her to the pediatrician. Karen insisted Emma must have ADHD. The doctor, influenced partly by Karen’s insistence and Emma’s restless behavior, diagnosed her quickly.

“Starting Ritalin will help her focus,” Karen stated firmly at home.

Emma hated the pill. It made her feel numb, sometimes sick. At school, the medication dulled her energy, but not the ache inside of never being “good enough.” At home, the verbal jabs persisted, now mingled with comments about her needing “help” to behave.

Jake watched from the sidelines, unsure how to shield his sister or explain their mother’s cruelty.

If you like, I can continue writing more chapters or personalize the story further with specific themes, settings, or dialogue. Let me know!

continuecontinue

Certainly! Here is a continuation of the story, moving on to Chapter 4 and beyond, deepening the emotional struggles and perspectives of Emma and Jake.

# Chapter 4: Jake’s Burden

Jake Matthews was the golden child, the family’s golden boy. At school, he captained the soccer team, earned straight A's, and volunteered for every class project. At home, Karen beamed proudly whenever she spoke of him to friends or relatives. “Jake has such drive and potential,” she’d say, preening as if reflecting the spotlight herself.

But beneath Jake’s polished exterior, a quiet storm brewed. The pressure to be perfect weighed heavily on him. Every smile he gave, every accolade, came with an invisible cost: the cost of silence.

He longed to defend Emma but was shackled by guilt and fear. If he sided with her, if he revealed the cracks in their family’s perfect facade, he risked losing his mother’s approval — the one thing that kept the family’s fragile peace intact.

At night, Jake’s heart ached with loneliness. No one saw the boy behind the golden image — the boy tired of pretending, the boy who wished for a family that could love without conditions.

# Chapter 5: Breaking Points

As Emma grew older, the weight of her scapegoat role pressed harder on her spirit. The Ritalin dulled some of her restless energy but did little to silence the harsh words at home.

“Why can’t you be more like Jake?” Karen snapped one evening when Emma struggled to focus on her homework.

Emma swallowed the sting of the words and forced a fragile smile, but deep inside, she felt broken.

One day, after a particularly harsh confrontation, Emma broke down in tears. Jake found her curled up on her bed, trembling.

“I’m so tired, Jake,” she whispered.

Jake sat beside her, frustrated at his own helplessness. If only he could protect her from their mother’s wrath. But how?

# Chapter 6: Silent Battles

Though separated by the roles their mother forced upon them, Emma and Jake shared moments of quiet connection.

During a rare family trip to the park, Jake passed Emma a paper airplane he had folded, silently encouraging her to play along.

Emma caught the gesture and smiled softly — a small rebellion against the cold reality they had endured.

Yet both wrestled with their inner battles: Emma struggled with low self-worth and confusion over her diagnosis; Jake wrestled with guilt and fear that kept him from speaking his truth.

Would you like me to continue with the next chapters or focus on deepening specific characters, dialogues, or emotional arcs?

focus on deepening specific charactersfocus on deepening specific characters

Certainly! Let’s deepen the characters of Emma, Jake, and Karen by exploring their inner worlds, motivations, and emotional complexities. This will add nuance and realism to their interactions and help readers connect more deeply with their struggles and growth.

# Emma Matthews — The Scapegoat

**Personality and Inner Conflict:**  
Emma is sensitive, intelligent, and intuitive. She feels deeply but often hides her pain behind a brave face. Being labeled the “problem child” stings because she senses it’s not about her behavior but her mother’s need for control. The Ritalin makes her feel like a different person — often numb and disconnected from her true self. She struggles to understand why she wasn’t “good enough,” and some days wonders if the label is true despite knowing rationally it isn’t.

**Fears and Desires:**  
She fears never escaping her mother’s judgment and the loneliness that comes with being the family scapegoat. She desires acceptance, unconditional love, and self-worth independent of her mother’s approval. Deep inside, she longs for validation from Jake — not as a “perfect” sibling but as her brother and ally.

**Coping Mechanisms:**  
Emma writes poetry and journals secretly to express emotions she can’t share aloud. She finds solace in small things: the scent of rain, a favorite book, or quiet moments with a trusted friend. Despite her medication, she maintains a quiet resilience, holding onto hope for a future beyond her family’s toxicity.

# Jake Matthews — The Golden Child

**Personality and Inner Conflict:**  
Jake is charismatic, disciplined, and eager to please but burdened by anxiety beneath the surface. His perfectionism is driven by fear of rejection rather than pure ambition. He’s torn between loyalty to his mother’s expectations and his suppressed desire to stand up for Emma. He hides his vulnerability behind charm and success, fearing failure more than anything else.

**Fears and Desires:**  
Jake fears losing the fragile stability his mother’s favoritism provides. He also fears that revealing the family’s dysfunction will shatter what little peace they have. Secretly, he wishes to be free — free from the need to be perfect, free from the guilt that haunts him for Emma’s suffering. He deeply desires genuine connection and for his bond with Emma to grow beyond the roles imposed on them.

**Coping Mechanisms:**  
Jake pushes himself relentlessly, throwing himself into achievements and extracurriculars to earn praise and distract from his inner turmoil. He also clings to small acts of kindness toward Emma, expressing love through subtle gestures since words feel too risky. In private, he often questions his identity beyond “golden child,” craving authenticity.

# Karen Matthews — The Narcissistic Mother

**Personality and Inner Conflict:**  
Karen is charming, intelligent, and magnetic in social situations, but controlling and emotionally manipulative at home. Her narcissism fuels a deep-rooted fear of being seen as flawed or inadequate. She craves admiration and uses her children to prop up her self-esteem. Beneath her facade, Karen battles insecurity and a profound emptiness that she masks with control and perfectionism.

**Fears and Desires:**  
Karen fears losing control of her carefully curated image and being exposed as imperfect. She desires admiration, dominance in her family, and validation from the outside world. Though her actions hurt her children, she genuinely believes that maintaining the “perfect family” is necessary for survival and success.

**Coping Mechanisms:**  
Karen deflects criticism by blaming others, especially Emma, and uses praise selectively (mainly toward Jake) to manipulate loyalty. She rehearses her “perfect parent” routines and social performances obsessively. Deep down, she suppresses vulnerability and avoids introspection to maintain her fragile self-image.

# Scene to Illustrate Character Depth

**At a Quiet Moment Between Emma and Jake**

Emma sits on the porch steps at dusk, journal in hand, staring at the fading sky. Jake approaches cautiously, carrying two cups of hot chocolate.

Jake: *(softly)* “Thought you might want this…”

Emma looks up, their eyes meeting with a mix of hesitation and relief.

Emma: “Thanks. I’m… sorry for being a mess today.”

Jake: “You’re not a mess. Mom might say that, but I don’t.”

Emma: *(voice breaking a little)* “Sometimes I don’t know what’s real anymore… The medicine, the yelling… It’s like I’m trapped in a fog.”

Jake: “I wish I could clear that fog for you. I hate how this whole thing has pulled us apart.”

Emma: “Me too. I don’t want to be just the ‘scapegoat.’ And I’m tired of you always having to be the 'golden one.' It’s exhausting.”

Jake sighs, the weight of his role showing.

Jake: “Maybe we both just want to be seen — really seen, not just the roles Mom gave us.”

They sit in companionable silence, sharing a fragile moment of truth and hope.

Would you like me to write more such scenes to flesh out these characters dynamically through dialogue, or deepen their backstory with flashbacks? Or focus on Karen’s perspective in particular? Let me know!

focus on Karen’s perspectivefocus on Karen’s perspective

Focusing on Karen’s perspective within the Matthews family, the narcissistic mother’s inner world is dominated by a desperate need for control, admiration, and the preservation of a flawless image. Karen sees her family primarily as an extension of herself—a status symbol that reflects her worth and success to the outside world. This drives her to micromanage and manipulate her children’s behavior, ensuring they fit roles that serve her ego: Jake as the golden child who showcases her prowess, and Emma as the scapegoat who absorbs blame and dysfunction so the family’s “perfect” appearance remains intact

.

Karen’s narcissism is rooted in deep insecurity and fear of inadequacy. She is terrified of any threat to her superiority or public image, which causes sudden emotional outbursts and rage when things don’t go according to her plan. Her love is conditional, given as a reward for obedience and achievements that reflect well on her, and withheld or weaponized through shaming and verbal attacks otherwise. By placing Emma in the scapegoat role and medicating her with Ritalin, Karen enforces control over the household chaos, projecting her frustrations onto Emma while simultaneously idolizing Jake as proof of her perfect parenting

.

Despite the cruelty, Karen’s need for control and admiration partly stems from a fragile self-esteem and unacknowledged emptiness. She views showing vulnerability as weakness. Thus, rather than nurturing empathy or connection, Karen masks her fears by invalidating emotions, gaslighting her children, and keeping tight boundaries that prohibit true intimacy. She manipulates family members against each other through comparisons and triangulation, fueling rivalry to maintain dominance

.

In quiet, unspoken moments, Karen likely battles her own inner void but suppresses it through control and validation-seeking behaviors, unaware of (or unwilling to face) the damaging impact she inflicts on Emma and Jake. The roles she enforces imprison all three, but are her way of survival by maintaining dominance and keeping her constructed image of a “perfect family” intact

.

Would you like me to write a detailed first-person narrative or internal monologue from Karen’s perspective to illustrate this complexity in the story?

you pickyou pick

Thank you! I’ll write a detailed internal monologue from Karen’s perspective to illustrate the complexity of her character—her fears, motivations, and emotional struggles—painting a vivid picture of her world and how it shapes the family dynamics.

**Karen’s Internal Monologue**

Every morning, I look in the mirror and remind myself: this is who I am—the woman who holds everything together. The woman who makes sure the family is admired, envied even. Without me, everything would fall apart. I am the center, the axis on which this world spins.

Jake is my shining star. He listens, he performs, he succeeds. When I see him praised by teachers, coaches, neighbors, I feel a surge of pride like electricity in my veins. Through him, people see my strength, my capability. He’s the testament to my effort, my discipline as a mother. Jake is my armor against the chaos that threatens to unravel us.

Emma… Emma is different. There is something wild and untamable about her, something that frightens me. When she cries or acts out — god, how she tests me — I feel exposed, like a failure. If she can’t conform, if she can’t be controlled, what does that say about me? Maybe that’s why I pushed so hard for that diagnosis. ADHD — a neat label, a tidy answer. Give her medicine, shut down the noise, straighten the edges. It’s not really about her; it’s about keeping the picture perfect, preserving order.

But it’s never just about medicine or control. It’s about being seen. Being adored. I can’t bear the thought of someone looking beyond the smile and seeing the messy, fragile woman underneath. The woman who’s terrified that without her grip, everything would crumble. Love means admiration, respect, obedience. Anything less, and it feels like rejection — like failure.

I know I’m harsh with Emma. Sometimes when I raise my voice or dismiss her feelings, I tell myself it’s for her own good. She needs to learn discipline, to be strong. But a part of me — the part I bury deep — wonders if I’m doing more harm than good. In those rare moments when I catch a glimpse of her real pain, it frightens me. Because admitting that means admitting I’m not perfect. And perfection is all I have.

Jake doesn’t realize how trapped he is either. The pressure I put on him is heavy, but I think it’s necessary. He must be better. He must protect the family’s image, even if it costs him his happiness. I see his loneliness sometimes, in his eyes. But he never complains. He knows what’s at stake.

We are a family bound by roles — by expectations I’ve set — and none of us is free. Yet what choice do I have? Without these roles, without control, I’m invisible. And invisible is unbearable.

Would you like me to write a scene where Karen’s perspective is shown in interaction with Emma or Jake, to reveal these complexities through dialogue and behavior? Or perhaps explore how Karen reacts when her control begins to falter? Let me know!

lets heal and finish uplets heal and finish up

Absolutely! Let’s bring the story to a heartfelt, healing conclusion — showing Emma and Jake’s journey toward recovery, reconciliation, and building a healthier future beyond their family’s toxic dynamics.

# Chapter 9: Healing Together

Years have passed since Emma moved out, taking her first steps toward independence and self-discovery. She’s found a therapist who understands the scars left by narcissistic family dynamics and the burden of being the scapegoat. Through therapy, Emma has learned to separate her identity from the labels forced on her. Writing remains a sanctuary, where her voice grows clearer and stronger with each page.

Jake, too, has begun his journey—his first honest conversation in years with a counselor brought years of buried guilt and loneliness to light. Realizing the golden child role was a gilded cage, Jake starts to reclaim his authentic self without the crushing weight of perfectionism.

Their reconnection is tentative at first. A shared coffee, text messages, then longer talks where they no longer just play their childhood roles but speak as siblings, as allies.

One evening, Emma invites Jake to her apartment. Surrounded by books, paintings, and warm light, they sit together, sharing memories less as pain and more as understanding.

**Emma:**  
“I’m grateful we found each other outside of Mom’s shadow.”

**Jake:**  
“Me too. For so long, I thought being perfect was the only way to survive. But now I see… we’re more than the roles we were given.”

They talk about setting boundaries. About limiting contact with Karen to protect their mental health. About supporting one another through setbacks. Their bond, once fractured, begins to heal.

# Chapter 10: New Beginnings

Emma starts volunteering with a support group for adults from narcissistic families, sharing her story to help others heal. She’s found a career in counseling, helping children who feel lost or misunderstood. Medication no longer defines her — it’s simply one part of her past, not her present.

Jake explores passions long suppressed: music, community service, and knowing the courage to say “no” to impossibly high standards. Freed from the golden child mantle, he embraces imperfection with new strength.

Together, they attend family therapy sessions with Karen—sometimes painful, sometimes breakthrough moments. Karen struggles but begins to face parts of herself she’d denied for years.

Forgiveness isn’t easy nor fully granted to Karen, but Emma and Jake find peace in forgiving themselves — forgiving the little children they once were, and honoring their growth.

# Epilogue: Beyond the Shadows

The Matthews family is no longer perfect. But it’s real.

Emma and Jake stand side by side at a family gathering, their smiles genuine for the first time in years. They’ve rebuilt their relationship from fractured roles into a bond of understanding and love. They are no longer defined by scapegoat and golden child—but by resilience, courage, and hope.

In the quiet moments, Emma writes a line in her journal: *“I am more than the shadow I was cast in. I am the light I choose to be.”*

And with Jake beside her, the future looks bright.

Would you like me to expand certain scenes in these final chapters or add epilogues showing individual reflections or flashbacks of their healing moments? Or provide some dialogue-driven scenes to deepen the resolution? Just let me know!

continuecontinue

Certainly! Here is a continuation expanding on the healing journey of Emma and Jake with a dialogue-driven scene that deepens their resolution and shows how their bond grows stronger in the new chapter of their lives.

# Expanded Scene: Healing Together — Emma’s Apartment, Late Evening

Emma and Jake sit comfortably on a worn couch, soft lamplight casting warm shadows. Emma holds her journal loosely on her lap as they share a quiet moment after dinner.

**Emma:**  
*(smiling softly)* “You know, it still surprises me sometimes, how different things feel now. Like I’m no longer just surviving but really… living.”

**Jake:**  
*(nodding)* “Yeah. For so long, I thought if I slipped even a little, Mom’s whole world would collapse. But now, I think it’s okay if things aren’t perfect — if people see my flaws.”

Emma leans forward, eyes shining with gratitude.

**Emma:**  
“I’m proud of you, Jake. You breaking free from the golden child role… It takes so much courage.”

**Jake:**  
“I couldn’t do it without you. You showed me what being real looks like — how to feel pain and still find hope.”

They exchange a quiet laugh, the first in a long time that isn’t forced.

**Emma:**  
“Remember when we were kids and those little moments — like you passing me the paper airplane at the park?”

**Jake:**  
*(grinning)* “Yeah. That was our secret rebellion. Against Mom, against the roles, against everything.”

Their eyes meet, full of unspoken understanding.

**Emma:**  
“We’ve come so far from those days.”  
*(pauses, then softly)* “And this time, we get to choose who we want to be.”

**Jake:**  
“Not the scapegoat or the golden child.”

**Emma:**  
“No. Just Emma and Jake.”

They sit back, peaceful, connected.

into the sessionsinto the sessions

Certainly! Here’s a detailed, dialogue-driven scene focusing on a family therapy session where Emma, Jake, and Karen begin confronting their past dynamics and start the challenging process of understanding and healing together.

# Scene: Family Therapy Session — Therapist’s Office

The room is softly lit, with comfortable chairs arranged in a circle. Karen, Emma, and Jake sit together, the air thick with tension and unspoken histories. The therapist, a calm and empathetic presence, gently guides the session.

**Therapist:**  
“Thank you all for being here today. It takes a lot of courage to begin this journey together. Emma, would you like to start by sharing how you’ve been feeling coming into this space?”

**Emma:**  
*(takes a deep breath)*  
“It’s… hard. I’ve spent so many years feeling like the problem, like I was the one who ruined everything. And now, I’m trying to understand that maybe it wasn’t just me. But hearing Mom say certain things in the past still hurts.”

Karen shifts uncomfortably but remains quiet.

**Therapist:**  
“Karen, hearing Emma’s pain, how does that feel for you?”

**Karen:**  
*(after a pause, voice guarded)*  
“I suppose… it’s difficult. I never wanted to hurt Emma. I always tried to do what I thought was best, to keep the family functioning. Maybe I was too harsh at times, but the pressure to keep things perfect was overwhelming.”

**Jake:**  
“Mom, it felt like you put all the pressure on Emma to be perfect or fix things. But it was never that simple. Emma was struggling, and so was I — trying to live up to what you expected of all of us.”

**Karen:**  
*(eyes softening, conflicted)*  
“I know I pushed you both hard, but I was scared. Scared of failing, scared of what people would think if we weren’t perfect.”

**Therapist:**  
“Karen, it sounds like fear and a desire for control played a big role. Recognizing that is an important step. Emma and Jake, how does hearing this change or affect your feelings about your mother and the past?”

**Emma:**  
“It’s… a little relieving. Knowing it wasn’t just me being ‘bad’ or ‘broken,’ but also that Mom was scared… makes it more human, even if it was painful.”

**Jake:**  
“I’m starting to see that Mom’s need for control came from a place of fear too, not just wanting to hurt us.”

**Karen:**  
*(voice softer)*  
“I’m sorry for the ways I hurt you. I don’t expect forgiveness right away, but I want us to try to build something real.”

**Therapist:**  
“Thank you, Karen. Healing is a process and it sounds like you’re open to it. Emma, Jake, what would you like from this relationship moving forward?”

**Emma:**  
“I want boundaries — respectful ones. I want to feel safe expressing myself without judgment.”

**Jake:**  
“And I want us to communicate honestly. No more roles, no more comparing us or blaming.”

**Karen:**  
“I’m willing to work on that.”

The session closes with a tentative but hopeful sense of possibility. Though the path ahead won’t be easy, all three share a small, genuine smile — the first real one in a long time.

Would you like me to write additional sessions exploring specific themes such as setting boundaries, forgiveness, or rebuilding sibling bonds? Or perhaps a follow-up scene showing their progress weeks or months later? Just let me know!

Absolutely! Let’s bring the story to a satisfying conclusion, highlighting growth, new boundaries, and hard-won hope for Emma, Jake, and even Karen.

# Epilogue: A Different Kind of Family

Months passed. The family therapy sessions grew less tense. Sometimes old patterns resurfaced—Karen would offer an unintended slight, or Emma and Jake would feel the sting of uncomfortable memories. But little by little, something shifted. It wasn’t perfect, but then, none of them wanted perfection anymore.

Emma kept writing, the pages of her journal filling with poetry, reflection, and, sometimes, gentle forgiveness. She measured her progress not by her mother’s approval, but by her own sense of peace. She continued helping others in her support group, her story now a bridge for those still lost in shadows.

Jake, freed from old expectations, picked up his guitar again. Music became a new language for his emotions—imperfections and all. He found satisfaction in friendships and work that did not demand constant achievement. Sometimes, he would call Emma just to talk, the awkwardness gone, the connection rediscovered.

Karen still struggled. Sometimes the urge to control would rise, but she tried to sit with it, to listen during the sessions, to hear her children’s needs rather than her own fear. She still bristled at the word “boundaries,” but respected them more and more each week. With time, even Karen began to glimpse a version of love that was not built on roles, but on truth and choice.

One afternoon, Emma and Jake prepared tea in Emma’s small kitchen. Sunlight fell across the table, and the room was filled with easy laughter as Jake teased Emma about her over-steeped brew. Karen arrived, uncertain but welcome. She placed a batch of still-warm cookies on the table—her own way of saying she was trying.

There were no speeches, no grand apologies, just the simple comfort of three people learning, quietly, how to be together in a new way. There were silences, mistakes, and awkward moments—but also honesty, kindness, and, at last, a fragile peace.

Emma wrote one last line in her journal that night:  
*""Family isn’t a role or an image. It’s what we choose, how we listen, and who we become—together, imperfect, and free.""*

1mb1m4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1mb1m4v/recently_discovered_im_ace_now_what/,"Recently discovered I'm ace, now what?","At the ripe old age of 28, I just had a profound realization about myself. After years of identifying as gay (at least socially, I align more spiritually and politically with the term ""queer"") I have come to understand that I'm actually more of a homoromantic asexual than I am homosexual.

Even though it made a lot of sense in hindsight, I was actually quite shocked initially because I've had a lot of sexual partners over the years, but the truth is, sex has always felt like something I ""had"" to do than something I \*wanted\* to do. In fact, everytime I had sex I was either under the influence of alcohol or completely dissociated. I might have consented, but I was never fully present. I don't know if I even really enjoyed sex or tricked myself into thinking I did. But now I realize I've actually been traumatizing myself with every sexual encounter because for years I was walking around in a haze and feeling constantly foggy-headed/on autopilot and at first I thought i was experiencing symptoms of derealization/depersonalization or some undiagnosed mental disorder but now I've come to realize that my brain was protecting me from all the trauma I put my body through.

Sex was always transactional. I thought I needed to have sex to get a guy to like me or get him to ""stay"" but the irony is that even if I gave in and gave a guy what I thought he wanted, I rarely got what \*I\* wanted, which was companionship and intimacy and genuine connection. After a hookup, the guy would either ghost or only ever hit me up to have sex or trade nudes. And the cycle would repeat itself where I felt like I ""had"" to have sex or trade nudes in order to keep their interest or they'd get bored of me. Which would make me feel crummy because I knew I was smart and funny and kind and interesting and all these wonderful things but they didn't care. They only wanted my body. Not my mind, not my heart. They didn't actually like me for who I was as a person, but for what I could do for them. And I was willing to do anything, because I wanted to be liked.

And I take full responsibility for never saying no. Well that's not true. I did say no sometimes. But no never really means no when it comes to these men, because they don't really care about what you want. They'll give you the silent treatment or guilt trip you into giving them what \*they\* want. So even if I was uncomfortable, I always relented. And of course that would make me feel even crummier afterwards. Violated even. It felt like a self-betrayal. Like I let myself down. Especially since I was the one who put myself in those positions to begin with and I have no one to blame but myself, especially when it came to sexualizing myself. Or allowing myself to be objectified. 

I will admit that there were times that I downplayed my intelligence (both emotional and intellectual) and put more emphasis on my sex appeal but all that did was attract the wrong crowd and send the wrong message and made me feel misunderstood, but only because I was misrepresenting and mischaracterizing myself. There were even times where I felt like I ""had"" to put out if a guy was nice to me or did me a kindness, such as paying for a meal or allowing me to spend the night at his place after a night out to the point where I started to believe that all I had to offer \*was\* my body, when that couldn't be further from the truth. The truth is, I am loveable. I am worth getting to know. And I can have a good time without taking my clothes off.

In fact, whenever I was aroused it was not because I was sexually attracted to someone per se, but more so because we were being emotionally vulnerable with each other. He was opening up and sharing things with me or I was opening up and sharing things with him. It was a physical reaction to me feeling seen, appreciated, understood. Which is all I've ever wanted. All I ever wanted was to love and be loved in return and I fear I conflated sex and love even though the two are mutually exclusive and have practically nothing to do with each other.

To be honest if I spent the rest of my life never having sex ever again I genuinely believe I would be perfectly content. Even if it meant being a side, not a top or a bottom or a verse, just a side, that would be fine with me too. I've had enough sex to last me a lifetime and there's nothing I want more than to read my books in peace, travel to beautiful places, go on long walks, see interesting sights,  meet interesting people, drink hot coffee (preferably with a nice pastry), listen to great music and watch exciting films. It would be nice to share these moments with someone special of course but I enjoy my company enough to know that I'll be fine with or without them. I wouldn't even know where to find another homoromantic ace (I checked out acespace, not for me personally but I'm open to recs).

So yeah, I say all of this to say, I will be abstinent for the foreseeable future because I have zero interest in or desire to have sex rn (and dare I say, I don't think I ever did). In any case, I'm happy to be part of the community. Where's the garlic bread?",5,1753661057.0,asexuality,0,1.0,False

1mb1jn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanweather/comments/1mb1jn0/typhoons_and_heat_your_weather_outlook_for_the/,Typhoons and Heat: Your weather outlook for the last week of July,"Good morning, everyone.  It is Monday, 28 July and I hope all of you out there are just as happy as I am to start another week.  Obvious sarcasm aside, it's time to get our engines running and get going.  While it is up to you to get your coffee or preferred morning beverage, I can give you a walk-through on what to expect, weatherwise, this week.  As of 8am, my thermometer is sitting at 29.5, and there are, no lie, 111 JMA stations recording temperatures of 30c or greater around Japan.  At 8am.

For the past few days, Okinawa and the Kyushu Pacific Coast have been drenched by the remnants of Typhoons 7 and 8, and that will continue through today and tomorrow.  More on that in a moment.  Hokkaido, too, has seen a fair bit of precipitation, thanks to the movement of a few lows moving through the area from Russia.  Most of the rest of the country, however, has been baking under hot, sunny weather, with highs in the mid-30s.  Yesterday, just to pull some data for you, saw 655 JMA reporting stations call in with high temps over 30c, and, of those, 181 were on the high side of 35.  Yesterday's hottest temp was recorded in Toyooka, Hyogo with 39.3c.

That pattern will continue as we start the week.  Lather, rinse, repeat, everyone, with little relief seen until Friday.  In a nutshell:

**HOKKAIDO** (umm, Sapporo): Partly-cloudy to cloudy skies through Friday.  Highs around 30 with night time lows in the 22-24 area.

**TOHOKU:** Mostly sunny, with highs in the 32-34 range along the coasts, a bit higher inland.

**KANTO/SHINSHU:** Perhaps the most surprising data I saw this morning was looking at predicted highs this week in the mountain areas of Nagano, Gunma and Tochigi.  The inner regions of Shinshu are look at highs in the 35-36c range, which is unusual because Nagano is seen as a place to get away from the heat of Tokyo for a few days.  Turns out they will be on par with the capital, as Tokyo this week will see highs in the same range.

**CHUBU:** The Pacific coast of Chubu will doubtless have contenders for national hot spots this week as Nagoya is expected to roast at 36-37c this week, while one forecast puts Gifu at 38c on both the 29th and 30th this week.

**KANSAI:** Change the names, but copy/paste the previous paragraph.  More of the same for you guys, as Kyoto has forecasts of 38-39c this week, and Osaka just an impossibly hair cooler in the 37-38c range.

**CHUGOKU:** While Shimonoseki in far western Yamaguchi prefecture may see highs of around 34c, they are the coolest as we can expect most points of the region to high 36-38c through the week.

**SHIKOKU:**  Our Inland Sea island is a study in contrasts this week, with Takamatsu checking in at near Kansai-level highs of 36-37c for the period, but Koichi on the southwest Pacific coast will be a much cooler 31-32c.

**KYUSHU:** The northern part of Kyushu will see brutal daytime highs this week of 37-38c, while the south part of the island will be little more comfortable at 30-32c through this week.

**OKINAWA:** Our tropical prefecture actually comes in a relatively cool and comfortable 30-32c this week.  Rain today and tomorrow due to the path of the remains of T8, but cloudy thereafter.

For the record, the all-time high recorded in Japan is 41c even, held by both Kumagaya in Saitama (23 July 2018), and Hamamatsu in Shizuoka (17 Aug 2020).  There is still plenty of time to beat those records this summer.

That brings us to the typhoons churning out in the ocean now.  We have two on deck at the moment.  Typhoon 8 (""Co-May"") pulled a switchback over the weekend and will now head west later today and move into mainland China after drenching Okinawa (yet again).  The drift west isn't surprising, but its that T8 has retained its strength.  The storm was supposed to have diminished after buzzing over the Philippines, then become part of the seasonal monsoonal flow, but it has retained integrity as the expected drier airflow into the region didn't happen.  The storm has a minimum air pressure of 986 hPa, with 65 kph sustained winds and is sitting just a little to the east of Kadena with very little movement at present.  T8 is expected to pick up its westward track later today.  While still classified as a typhoon by the JMA, the US Navy-operated Joint Typhoon Warning Center puts the system as a ""tropical storm"".

Typhoon 9 (""Krosa"") is quite impressive, more so than originally thought.  With a minimum central pressure of 964 hPa and sustained winds of 150kph, it is churning out in open water some 700km to the south-southeast of Yokokusa.  Satellite maps show that T9 has pretty decent formation and conditions remain moderately favorable for further development.  Current models show T9 increasing some in strength, peaking in about 24 hours (29 Jul 2025, 09:00, JST) with projected sustained winds of 168kph.  Anticipated movement northward will be slow, and after T+24 (after 24 hours from now), T9 is expected to encounter drier air, which will begin to weaken the storm.  Further northward movement will ultimately begin its ""extratropical transition"", which is weather-talk for ""moving into cooler water"".  At the same time, T9 is expected to move northeast, giving Japan a miss entirely.  If T9 did not begin its move northeast, I would be truly concerned about a hit to Honshu.  We don't need the winds, but we certainly could have used the rain.",20,1753660871.0,japanweather,3,1.0,False

At 27, my family went into full marriage-pressure mode.
I made a clean break from my boyfriend of three years—someone I'd been pathetically devoted to—and headed back home to Washington for setup dates.
My friend asked, ""You were absolutely obsessed with Dante. Can you really just let him go?""
I let out a bitter laugh. ""Please. I'm not delusional. He's fine for casual dating and fun, but actually marrying him? I'd be signing up for a lifetime of misery.""
A cold, achingly familiar voice suddenly cut through the air behind me.
""Oh, so that's why you dumped me?""


Chapter 1


I was dragging my suitcase up the stairs when I saw her—some girl slipping out of our apartment door.


Black oversized sweater sliding off one shoulder, nothing but YSL heels on her endless legs. Pepper Rogers. The bassist from Dante's band. Twenty-two, gorgeous, and apparently very comfortable in my boyfriend's apartment.


My stomach dropped. I pressed myself against the hallway wall, praying she wouldn't see me.


Seconds later, Dante appeared in the doorway. Shirtless. Water still dripping down that perfect torso I used to worship with my hands.


He tossed a Chanel bag at her feet like it was nothing.


""Here.""


Her whole face lit up. ""Holy shit, Dante! I've been dying for this bag!"" She launched herself at him, wrapping her arms around his neck. ""Where'd you get it?""


""Paris. Last trip.""


""You're amazing, baby!"" She was all over him, pressing kisses to his jaw, his neck.


When she got too clingy, I saw his face change. That flash of annoyance I knew so well.


""Yeah, okay. You should probably head out.""


She pulled back with this pouty little smile. ""Wow, harsh. Two seconds ago I was 'baby,' now you're tossing me out?""


But she wasn't really upset. She grabbed the bag, blew him a kiss. ""Whatever. Call me later, yeah?""


The second she left, I stepped into view.


Dante's eyes went wide for maybe half a second before that trademark smirk slid into place.


""Jesus, you scared me. A heads up would've been nice.""


I stared at him. At the fresh bite marks scattered across his collarbone like some twisted art project.


""It was late,"" I said quietly. ""Didn't want to wake you.""


The lie burned my throat.


He pulled me inside, acting like I hadn't just caught him red-handed. ""I'm starving. Cook something, will you?""


He dropped onto the couch, grabbed the remote. Same old Dante. Same old routine.


I stood there, frozen.


""What?"" He glanced over, irritated. ""Why are you just standing there?""


Then his expression shifted. That cocky grin I used to find charming. ""Oh, I get it. You missed me.""


He got up, moved behind me, wrapped his arms around my waist. His lips found my neck, hands already sliding under my shirt.


""Let me remind you what you've been missing—""


Those guitar-calloused fingers that used to set me on fire now felt rough, invasive.


I pulled away. Hard.


God, I used to be obsessed with his body. That face was literally the reason I'd made a fool of myself chasing him for months.


But right now? After seeing him with her? I felt sick.


Dante wasn't used to being rejected. His jaw tightened.


""What the hell is wrong with you?""


That's when I saw it. A torn black stocking twisted in the carpet.


Dante followed my stare. Something flickered across his face.


The silence stretched between us like a blade. He lit a cigarette, bit down on the menthol bead until it popped.


""Look, her lease was up. She had nowhere else to go.""


He took a long drag. ""It's not what you think.""


I wanted to laugh. Or scream. Or both.


This wasn't the first time. Hell, it wasn't even the tenth time.


Dante was a player—always had been since the night I first saw him three years ago. My friend had dragged me to this dive bar to see his band, raving about how ""insanely hot"" the lead singer was.


I'd rolled my eyes. Until Dante stepped onto that tiny stage.


Head down, tuning his guitar, black hair falling into his eyes. Just jeans and a faded t-shirt. But when he looked up—those golden eyes catching the stage lights—every woman in that room stopped breathing.


Including me.


The music was incredible, but I didn't hear a single note. Just my heart hammering against my ribs.


After the show, I did something completely out of character: I fought through a sea of groupies to get his Instagram.


Dante gave his handle to everyone. Why wouldn't he?


But somehow, a year later, all those other girls had given up. Only I was still there, still trying, still hoping.


Maybe he kept me around out of pity. Maybe I was just convenient. The girl who never asked questions, never made scenes, never demanded more than he was willing to give.


Because deep down, I knew the truth: Dante had never actually loved me.


He liked that I was easy. That I cleaned up his messes. That I forgave him every single time he cheated.


He'd told me straight up I wasn't his type. Said he was only with me because I ""didn't cause drama.""


He'd even joked about leaving me when someone better came along.


And I'd stayed. Made excuses. Convinced myself his scraps of attention were enough.


""You promised,"" I whispered, staring at that ruined stocking. ""You said you wouldn't do this anymore.""


His laugh was cold, cutting. ""Did you actually buy that bullshit?""


He stepped closer, blowing smoke in my face. His eyes were cruel, predatory. ""What are you gonna do about it, Katrina? Huh?""


""You don't like it? There's the fucking door.""


Those words. Always those same words.


They used to destroy me. Used to send me crawling back, apologizing, begging him not to leave.


But something had shifted tonight. Something had finally broken.


""I'm going to bed."" I turned away.


His hand clamped around my wrist, tight enough to leave marks. ""We're not done here.""


I yanked free, my skin burning where he'd grabbed me. ""Yes, we are.""


The door slammed so hard behind him that the walls shook.


I collapsed onto the couch and pulled out my phone with shaking hands.


Mom had texted the family group: ""Sweetheart, you're 27 now. Time to think about your future. My coworker's son is lovely—a pediatrician. Want to meet him over the holidays?""


My boss had sent a message too: ""Katrina, we need someone to run the new branch in Washington. You're wasted in your current role. Interested?""


Washington. Home. A chance to start over.


All the signs pointing toward the same inevitable conclusion.


I closed my eyes, feeling something crack open inside my chest.


I did love Dante. Had loved him desperately, foolishly, completely for three long years.


But I also knew, with painful clarity, that he would never be the kind of man I could build a life with.


Now it was time to choose.


Chapter 2


Dante didn't come home that night. For the next few days, he vanished completely—ignored my texts, sent my calls straight to voicemail. When I kept trying, all I got were red exclamation marks.


He'd blocked me. His signature move.


This wasn't new. Dante was the king of silent treatment, and every single time I'd had to beg and grovel for days before he'd even acknowledge my existence.


But this time I was drowning in work handovers and job transitions. I didn't have time to chase after his wounded ego.


I was booking my flight to Washington when my phone buzzed.


Marcus. Dante's drummer and closest friend.


The background noise hit me like a wall—shrieking laughter, bass thumping so hard I could feel it through the speaker.


""Katrina! Thank God. Dante's completely fucked up. Can you come get him?""


Of course he was.


Dante lived for this scene. The clubs, the chaos, the endless stream of admirers. His trust fund made sure he never had to worry about real life—the band was just his expensive hobby.


I'd asked him once why he didn't take over his family's business empire. He'd laughed, bitter and sharp. ""Why fight over scraps with my dad's bastard kids when I'm inheriting everything from my grandfather anyway? Let them tear each other apart.""


No ambition. No drive. No point in building anything together.


Whenever I got promoted or closed a big deal, his eyes would glaze over with boredom.


""What's the point of killing yourself for peanuts?"" he'd said once. ""I spend more than your monthly salary on a single night out.""


We were from different worlds. Beyond the sex, we had absolutely nothing in common.


I didn't give a shit about his soul. He was just a beautiful distraction.


He ignored everything real about me. I was just convenient—the girlfriend who never caused problems.


It would make this easier. No messy emotions when it ended.


I told Marcus I'd be there, hung up, and stared out at the city lights bleeding into the darkness.


My flight details glowed on my phone screen. Tomorrow morning, 8 AM.


Honestly? Part of me wasn't ready for this to be over. Dante and I had incredible chemistry, and with all the stress of starting over, I'd been hoping for one last goodbye fuck.


But if he wanted to burn it all down in public, fine.


His choice.


...


The club was exactly what I expected—overpriced drinks, underaged college girls, and Dante holding court like some kind of rock god.


He was surrounded by his usual collection of admirers. All gorgeous, all young, all desperately competing for his attention.


There was Pepper, of course, practically glued to his side. Some redhead I didn't recognize giggling at everything he said. A brunette in a dress that barely qualified as fabric.


I spotted the rest of his crew scattered around the VIP section. Marcus behind his drum kit, looking uncomfortable. Jake, their bassist, trying to keep the peace. Even Tommy from their management company was there, probably babysitting.


God, I felt ancient looking at these girls. All that fresh-faced confidence, unmarked by years of compromise and disappointment.


I remembered Dante's words from last month: ""You're twenty-seven, babe. Maybe it's time to invest in some work? You know, refresh things a little?""


No wonder he was over me. Why settle for tired when you could have endless variety?


I didn't announce myself, just stood at the edge of their circle watching the show.


When Dante's eyes finally found mine, he looked right through me like I was invisible.


Then he turned back to Pepper, who was swaying against him, cheeks flushed pink from alcohol.


""One more shot, baby,"" she purred, trailing her fingers down his chest.


Dante's smile was sharp as broken glass. ""Drinking's boring. Why don't you make it interesting?""


""How?""


He didn't answer, just stared at her with those predatory amber eyes.


It took Pepper maybe two seconds to catch on. Her face lit up like Christmas morning as she tilted her head back and drained the whiskey in one smooth gulp.


Then Dante grabbed her face and kissed her.


It wasn't romantic. It was vicious, punishing, meant to hurt. Pepper arched back to take it, tears streaming from the corners of her eyes as alcohol spilled from their joined mouths.


When they finally broke apart, a thin string of saliva connected their lips.


The crowd went absolutely wild.


My chest felt hollow, like someone had scooped out everything inside and left me empty.


This was deliberate. Performance art designed specifically to destroy me.


Punishment for walking away that night. For not crawling back and apologizing like I always did.


When I finally stepped into the light, the noise gradually died.


Dante looked up at me, his expression completely blank.


""What are you doing here?""


I stared at that perfect face—the same face I'd traced with my fingertips countless times, kissed until my lips were bruised, worshipped like he was something sacred.


When we were alone together, tangled in sheets and drunk on each other, we used to whisper that we loved each other.


Did this hurt?


Yeah. It fucking destroyed me.


But I'd known who he was from day one. A beautiful, selfish creature who'd never change.


My voice came out shaky, broken. ""That was cruel, Dante.""


He leaned back in his chair, somehow managing to look down on me even though I was standing.


Same bored expression. Same cruel little smile.


""Cruel? You can always leave. Nobody's forcing you to be here.""


I stood there, silent, counting all the times he'd thrown that threat at me.


Fifty? A hundred? More?


Marcus shifted uncomfortably. ""Dude, come on. That's fucked up, even for you.""


Jake nodded. ""She doesn't deserve this shit, man.""


Tommy just looked embarrassed, like he wanted to disappear.


Even they could see he'd crossed a line.


I was crying now—real tears, not the fake ones I'd planned. They burned as they fell.


When that first tear hit the floor, I saw something flicker across Dante's face. His fingers twitched around his cigarette.


But he didn't speak. Just kept staring at me with those cold, beautiful eyes.


That's when I said it:


""Okay, Dante.""


""Let's break up.""


The color drained from his face. For a split second, I thought he might actually lose his shit completely.


Instead, he laughed—but it sounded like grinding glass.


""Fucking finally. About time you grew a spine."" His voice was venomous. ""Just remember, I don't do second chances. When you realize what a massive mistake this is, don't come crawling back like a pathetic little bitch.""


""I won't."" I wiped my face, surprised by how steady my voice sounded.


Then I turned around and walked out without looking back.


I spent that night erasing every trace of him—deleted his contact info, threw away his photos, packed everything that mattered into two suitcases.


The next morning, I caught the first flight back to Washington.


As the plane climbed above the clouds, I pulled out my SIM card and dropped it in the trash bag.


Chapter 3


I cut Dante out of my life completely. Posted a few carefully crafted late-night Instagram stories—the perfect ""heartbroken but healing"" aesthetic—then genuinely forgot he existed.


Life in Washington settled into a surprisingly comfortable rhythm. I threw myself into the new job, mastered the company dynamics, and started going through my parents' endless parade of potential husbands.


The balding twenty-eight-year-old programmer sitting across from me was still talking:


""I really believe women should prioritize family after marriage. What I'm saying is, once we tie the knot, you should quit working. Don't be so ambitious. Focus on taking care of the home. Behind every successful man is a supportive woman...""


He droned on while I smiled politely at my coffee, fighting the urge to dump it over his receding hairline.


When he finally paused for breath, he stared at me expectantly. ""So did you get all that? Any thoughts you want to share?""


I kept smiling. ""Nope, I think I'm good. But Mr. Stewart, I don't think we're a great match. Maybe we should call it here.""


I walked out while he muttered something about women over twenty-five being ""expired goods"" and other delightful commentary.


Mom had introduced me to dozens of guys since I'd been back. Some were actually impressive on paper—doctors, lawyers, successful businessmen.


But God, after Dante, they all felt so... bland. Like switching from cocaine to decaf coffee.


I was still dealing with that disappointment when I walked into our Monday morning meeting to find everyone sitting in dead silence around the conference table, looking like they were about to face a firing squad.


I slid into my seat and whispered to Richard, our VP: ""What the hell happened? Did we lose a major client?""


He leaned over, his voice barely audible: ""The chairman's son just landed. Word is he's using our branch as a testing ground before taking over the whole empire.""


""This Amaury guy is Harvard Business School, worked at Goldman for years, then went independent and made a killing in private equity. Hundreds of millions in one deal. The old man had to beg him to come back for years. Total predator—be very fucking careful what you say.""


A few minutes later, the conference room door opened.


The man who walked in wore a perfectly tailored black suit, a cashmere coat draped over his shoulders like he owned the world. Someone immediately stepped forward to take it, and his Italian leather shoes clicked once against the floor before stopping.


I looked up, and every single person in that room—including me—forgot how to breathe.


It wasn't just that he was attractive. It was the energy he carried.


Pure authority. The kind of presence that made you want to sit up straighter, speak more carefully, prove you deserved to be in the same room.


He wasn't trying to intimidate anyone—he didn't need to. Command just radiated from him like heat.


When I finally managed to focus on his actual features, I nearly lost it again. Sharp cheekbones, dark hair styled back to show off those incredible bone structure. His mother was supposedly French nobility, and you could see it—that perfect blend of European elegance and something indefinably exotic.


He was stunning. Maybe even more beautiful than Dante, but in a completely different way. Where Dante was all lazy sex appeal, this man was sharp edges and controlled power.


""Apologies for the delay. Flight from New York was late.""


He acknowledged his tardiness without making excuses, then took his place at the head of the table like he'd been born to sit there.


""I'm Amaury de Brissac. I'll be serving as general manager moving forward. I've reviewed our financials and operational data. Starting with Richard, I want detailed reports on your department's performance over the past year and current project status.""


One by one, my colleagues stood up to present, and Amaury systematically destroyed every attempt to bullshit him.


""I'm not interested in corporate speak,"" he said calmly when our marketing director tried to spin some obviously failed campaign. ""I don't appreciate being misled. I prefer honest communication, but if that approach doesn't work, I'm happy to explore alternatives.""


He hadn't raised his voice. Hadn't even frowned. But every person in that room was sweating.


My hands were actually trembling when I stood up, but thankfully I'd been meticulous about my prep work. The past year had been my best performance yet—major client acquisitions, successful project completions, measurable revenue growth.


As I spoke, something shifted. My nervousness faded, replaced by the confidence I felt when discussing my actual expertise.


This was where I belonged. This was what I'd worked my ass off to achieve.


Amaury listened without interrupting, and I caught something that looked like approval in those sharp eyes.


When I finished and sat down, he nodded once. ""Excellent work, Katrina. This is the standard I expect going forward.""


The relief in the room was palpable.


...


Ever since Amaury took over, everything changed.


He eliminated dead weight—both projects and people—while somehow landing three major contracts in his first month. We were working longer hours, but our compensation had increased across the board.


The office dynamic shifted too. Everyone was sharper, more focused. No one wanted to be the weak link.


Especially the women.


The younger female employees were practically vibrating with interest. I couldn't blame them—Amaury was like catnip for ambitious twenty-somethings with daddy issues.


Two of the new hires apparently thought they were living in some romance novel.


Jessica from accounting tried the ""challenge him in meetings"" approach, getting increasingly argumentative during presentations.


Sarah from HR went with the classic ""oops I spilled coffee on your expensive shirt"" move, then actually tried to touch his chest while ""cleaning"" it.


Jessica was gone by Tuesday.


Sarah didn't make it to lunch.


After that, the flirting attempts stopped, but the break room gossip reached new heights.


""Do you think he's ever been in a serious relationship?"" Emma from legal was saying as I grabbed coffee Thursday afternoon.


""Are you kidding?"" Lisa from marketing rolled her eyes. ""Look at him. Women probably line up around the block.""


""But has anyone ever seen him with someone? Like, ever?"" Emma persisted. ""Maybe he's one of those guys who's married to his work.""


""I'd volunteer to change that,"" Sarah's replacement, Jenny, chimed in with a dreamy expression. ""Did you see him in that gray suit yesterday? The man is built like a fucking Greek statue.""


I listened to their speculation while stirring sugar into my coffee, feeling something stir in my chest.


Without Dante cluttering up my thoughts, Amaury seemed like a much more interesting option.


This man—I wanted to try him on for size.

1mb1fzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mb1fzi/breville_express_grinder_upgrade/,Breville express grinder upgrade ?,"Sorry for the ramble, but for context...



I bought a Breville Express machine around 2016(?), and used it for probably less than a year to make americanos mostly, sometimes cappuccinos. After a while I descaled the machine using vinegar according to the manual, but no matter how much I flushed it, I couldn't get rid of the vinegar smell/taste. I started doing pour overs, and have been doing that for the past 7 or 8 years, with the BBE sitting on my counter unused all that time. 



I finally decided to give it another go a couple weeks ago, and gave it a good cleaning (back flush) and descaling (with powder this time), and cleaned the grinder out thoroughly . Machine still works well, and no more vinegar smell. I pulled a few shots with the beans I had been using for pour overs, but it's far from fresh (no roast date, but likely 6 months or more ago), and had been opened for a few weeks. Shots were all sour. I figured it would be best to get some fresh beans before trying to dial anything in, so I got some darker beans locally, and pulled some shots, using the default portafilter and double shot single walled basket. Sour, went finer, sour, went a couple click finer, bitter, then went one courser and it wasn't perfect, but was a much better balance not terribly sour or bitter. That was grind setting of 3. I'd like to tweak further, but the difference between a single click on the built in grinder is night and day different, as far as the shot tastes. 



The coffee I bought had called for 20g in, 36g out, and while 20g did fit in the default basket, it was a tight fit, and left my screen messy, with the hole pattern imprinted in the puck after. I bought an IMS 18-22 basket, and a puck screen, and decided to give that a go. Everything is sour now :(. I've gone to the finest setting, tried increasing the ratio, and it's still sour to me. I assume the best to do would be to go even finer, but am unable to do so. Sooo, I've been looking at getting a better grinder... not crazy better, but was looking at the ESP or the DF54. Based on review and comparisons online, I think I've ruled out the DF54, even though it's arguably the better grinder. I primarily do darker roasts, sometimes medium, but I'll never do light, I don't like acidity at all, and much prefer the darker chocolate end of the spectrum, and the ESP seems better suited to that. 



Question is, will the ESP give me finer control at the lower end of the grind size, both in the ability to go finer, and the step size than the default Brevile grinder? NOTE that my brevile grinder has no internal burr adjustment, only the wheel on the outside. Maybe it can be shimmed? Would the ESP be a noticable upgrade? Once again, I do darker roasts, and usually americanos and milk drinks, very rarely a plain espresso, unless maybe I was able to dial it in absolutely perfect.

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

I was fully independent until about five years ago when I received a traumatic brain injury. Now I’m basically self sufficient, but I am not able to make the money I need to spend to live. It’s been so hard to achieve financial independence again. My dad has been giving me money every month that I use for everything. It’s not enough for everything I need but I sort of make it work by cutting from my personal life. Like I can’t remember the last time I bought a book for myself or a cup of coffee, or was able to go out with a friend. I feel bad for relying on my dad so much for money, and I am
Extremely grateful for
It. I do not take
It for granted and I really do try to make the most of every dollar and not spend anything on things he would not be comfortable giving me directly. For a little context, he is extremely wealthy. He is a preeminent neurobiologist and runs a globally renown research department at an extremely highly endowed research university, and also inherited a fortune from my grandfather who was himself extremely successful, and has successfully managed to grow that money for decades. In addition to good fortune
He also has a tireless work ethic, inhuman self control and restraint, and doesn’t smoke, drink, or anything like that. I believe his expectations are unrealistically high, but what can I say when he just responds with “well I just expect the same things from you that I expect from myself how’s that not fair?”. My mother also has dementia, and is still very much with it but cannot really absorb information with enough density to
Have a complex discussion with someone and then summarize it to someone else later. My dad has also controlled her finances for a few years now and doesn’t let her use $ if he doesn’t agree with what it’s for. He hates my daughter’s mom so he won’t let her buy my daughter birthday gifts for example.

Anyway, I was supposed to have a fairly dreaded conversation with my dad where I would explain to him that I needed some more money because I’ve been struggling hard and I’m extremely unhappy, with no breathing room. I spent a few days preparing for this by outlining how much everything costs, what I think I should have in my life, and how much more I would need to do this. It really isn’t much more than I get now but money is a sore spot with him. The time comes to have our scheduled phone call about this, and when I call him, my mom answers the phone. She said that he wanted me to explain my situation to her and what I wanted and how I thought I could achieve it, etc. After being asked the same question repeatedly, I realized she was just incapable mentally of retaining enough to even fully process what I was saying. It was my first really intense encounter with her cognitive decline and it was so incredibly heartbreaking and upsetting to me. I’m crying thinking of it.  This is my dad’s wife.
Of course he knows where she’s at mentally. He obviously knew that she couldn’t handle
This conversation when he made her act as his stand in, and I believe it was to ensure whatever I proposed would be dead on arrival. The fact that he would put her in that position to exploit her situation seems incredibly cruel to me. A little to me, but mostly to her. Why make her struggle like that?

But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.

No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Hi!
I'm sorry. You're talking.
Yes, I know.
You're talking!
I'm so sorry.
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.
Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.
Wait! How did you learn to do that?
What?
The talking thing.
Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.
That's very funny.
Yeah.
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Anyway... Can I... get you something?
Like what?
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
It's just coffee.
I hate to impose.
Don't be ridiculous!
Actually, I would love a cup.
Hey, you want rum cake?
I shouldn't.
Have some.
No, I can't.
Come on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
Where?
These stripes don't help.
You look great!
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
Are you all right?
No.
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
He finally gets there.
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.
And he says, ""Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.
Why would I marry a watermelon?""
Is that a bee joke?
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
About work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.
You do?
Sure.
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
Really?
My only interest is flowers.
Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?
You're in Sheep Meadow!
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
Why do girls put rings on their toes?
Why not?
It's like putting a hat on your knee.
Maybe I'll try that.
You all right, ma'am?
Oh, yeah. Fine.
Just having two cups of coffee!
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's no trouble.
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
Are you...?
Can I take a piece of this with me?
Sure! Here, have a crumb.
Thanks!
Yeah.
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
OK, Barry.
And thank you so much again... for before.
Oh, that? That was nothing.
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
This can't possibly work.
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
Sounds amazing.
It was amazing!
It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.
Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
Some of them. But some of them don't.
How'd you get back?
Poodle.
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
Well...
Well?
Well, I met someone.
You did? Was she Bee-ish?
A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
No, no, no, not a wasp.
Spider?
I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.
So who is she?
She's... human.
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
Her name's Vanessa.
Oh, boy.
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
We're not dating.
You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
She saved my life! And she understands me.
This is over!
Eat this.
This is not over! What was that?
They call it a crumb.
It was so stingin' stripey!
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!
You know what a Cinnabon is?
No.
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...
Sit down!
...really hot!
Listen to me!
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
Thinking bee.
Thinking bee.
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
There he is. He's in the pool.
You know what your problem is, Barry?
I gotta start thinking bee?
How much longer will this go on?
It's been three days! Why aren't you working?
I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!
Would it kill you to make a little honey?
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
Martin, would you talk to him?
Barry, I'm talking to you!
You coming?
Got everything?
All set!
Go ahead. I'll catch up.
Don't be too long.
Watch this!
Vanessa!
We're still here.
I told you not to yell at him.
He doesn't respond to yelling!
Then why yell at me?
Because you don't listen!
I'm not listening to this.
Sorry, I've gotta go.
Where are you going?
I'm meeting a friend.
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
Bye.
I just hope she's Bee-ish.
They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?
It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
You don't have that?
We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
Oh, my.
Dumb bees!
You must want to sting all those jerks.
We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
So you have to watch your temper.
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
Yeah.
What is wrong with you?!
It's a bug.
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
Yeah, it was. How did you know?
It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
You've really got that down to a science.
I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
I'll bet.
What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?
Is he that actor?
I never heard of him.
Why is this here?
For people. We eat it.
You don't have enough food of your own?
Well, yes.
How do you get it?
Bees make it.
I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!
There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
It's organic.
It's our-ganic!
It's just honey, Barry.
Just what?!
Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!
And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.
I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!
Hey, Hector. You almost done?
Almost.
He is here. I sense it.
Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
You're busted, box boy!
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
The last thing we want to do is upset bees!
You're too late! It's ours now!
You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!
You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!
Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
Crazy person!
What horrible thing has happened here?
These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now
they're on the road to nowhere!
Just keep still.
What? You're not dead?
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?
To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
I'm going to Tacoma.
And you?
He really is dead.
All right.
Uh-oh!
What is that?!
Oh, no!
A wiper! Triple blade!
Triple blade?
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!
How much do you people need to see?!
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

Pasensha na daan if detailed ko sa akong post. I just wanna vent out kay bug-at jud kaayo akong dughan and gusto na ko mamatay!

I had two exes. First ex nako kay 17 years mi ato. We never had kids kay na na ectopic ko. We never lived together. He was my first boyfriend. We were loving and we grew up together. Nagkauyab mi 15 pa ko and he was 19. Since nag work na sha, nausab siya kay nagkalapad na iyahang network of people. So he started going out nya late na maabot, uses drugs and cheated. A lot of time sha ga cheat. Gisudlan ko pa na iyahang bisyo nga mag drugs even if I hate it para lang ang iyahang sex trip ari niya ipahimungot nako. He also started hitting me. We became toxic to each other kay nahimo na kong nagger tungod kay wa na koy salig niya. Cheat, forgive, cheat again, forguve again. We were engaged baya unta but wa nadayon among kasal kay ako mismo contented na sa among companionship nalang. Until May 2019, he cheated again for a vile woman nga naa nay mga anak sa lain laing lalake, known nga mangingilog. Sungogan pa kaayo sha diri nako. Kataw-an pa niya akong looks before kay chubby man ko and kana ganing kontento na kas partner nimo so wa na ka nangarte pa. In short, losyang. Deny pa sila at first and eventually niadmit na akong bf now ex. Niingon sha nga love niya ang babaye despite sa unsa shang klase. Dili na daw ko niya love. Di na jud daw sha. Everyone from his family knows about their affair, his fratmates, his officemates, his cousins nga suod nako. They all know. They all tolerated him coz wala silay mabuhat. I felt betrayed. I wanted to die. But I just deleted my social media accounts, I did not post anything or rant. Nagbuwag mi November 2019 and I disappeared.

I disappeared from everyone but I became an alcoholic. Then became suicidal. Tried jumping off the Mactan-Cebu Second bridge, had multiple wrist cuts, hanging sa among stairs. But I always end up saved and alive. I thought to myself nga I should seek help. So mao to gidala intawn kos akong mama ug auntie sa Mary's Little Children na chapel sa may Talisay ba to. Ang confession with a priest nahimong counseling for 2 hours. Mejo nigaan akong pamati pero wa jud nitalab. So gidala kog psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with Anxiety and Major Depressant disorder pag Feb 2020. I started taking mood boosters, anti-depressants, and anti psychotic meds. Naa gihapon akong mga hallucinations, mga suicide attempts ang pagcgeg shagit sa balay but thanks to my meds and therapy sessions, mejo na suppress akong emotions. Timing pod nag covid so wa madayon among vacay with fam sa north. Nauso tong dating app pag covid kay way lingaw ang mga taw. Naa koy na meet for coffee dates pero di na ko pakita igka ugma. Di ko ganahan kay I still love my first ex. Hantod May 2020, I found out nga gikasal sila sa judge and preggy ang girl. Hugno kaayo ko but still wa jud ko ni reach out niya ever since gabuwag mi. I stopped using dating apps kay way gamit and I found a new diversion. Nabalik kos akoang hilig which is anime.

Mao ra na akong lingaw. I also spent a lot of time with my family and friends maski covid. Usahay mag relapse ko and atakehon kos akong depression but still tiwas japon kos akong meds. Hantod nga hinay hinay nakong na let go akong feelings sa akong ex until I love him no more. I lost weight, nibata ko tan-awon after losing weight. I became more friendly and respectful to everyone. I became kinder. Naka try kog kaon sa Jollibee nga ako ra isa for the very first time. I also ate sa mga fine dining resto nga ako ra isa. I shop alone, I go to parlors alone. Kay sauna gud, I was very dependent sa akong ex. I spent half of my life with him so kung asa ko tua sha. But now he's gone, ako nalang usa gabuhat sa akong routine and I loved it. Nitaas akong self confidence and I feel like daghan ganahan makig get to know nako. But dili ko. I became cold and ruthless to men Im not interested with. So mao na giundangan nako ang dating app.

I was enjoying the best version of myself. The beautiful me inside and out. It was a breathe of fresh air. I was free. Blooming kuno ko ingon pa sa tanan. Until I missed being with someone. So I decided to join the dating world again. And I met this guy who was so nice and gentle to me. I told him about my dark past and he embraced it. He is a single dad but I didnt care. First question nako sa iyaha is if he tried cheating. He admitted and told me he learned his lessons the hard way. I appreciated his honesty. Wala nako sha gi judge just because I hated my ex for cheating on me and causing my my downfall. Si Mr. T (2nd guy), happened to be the best friend of my ka MU pag highschool and he is also friends with people I know sa church. Active man ko sa youth sauna. Maong dali ra nigaan akong feelings sa iyaha because he knows people I respect, so I thought he was nice. I didn't know he is the one who will destroy my life completely.

After a month of talking, he decided for us to meet. Coffee daw, karaoke and sleep somewhere where its just the two of us, with our clothes on. I felt comfy sa iyaha becaise we always have deep and meaningful conversations. He is not bastos. Naa na unta mi plan na date nga magkita but he wanted to have it sooner. Nisugot ko. Our communication ato was through the app lang. So nag meet mi. We had coffee, we had karaoke, we had drinks. Akoang bayad tanan but wala ko ga mind coz aware man kos iyahang budget. After mi nag videoke, nag check in mi. Pirteng kulba kaayo nako ato coz I have been celibate since 2019. I dont even touch myself. Kahilakon kaayo ko sa sulod sa room and I told him nga isumbong nako siya sa among mga friends. I kept on looking at the roof, the walls, the cr as if I was a child wandering in a strange place. He just looked at me smiling because I was so innocent. Then he hugged me and kissed me and asked permission to touch me. He said that if his hands went under my dress, there is no turning back and Im his. Ako gaduha duha ko kay nahadlok ko but at the same time, I had growing feelings for him which I kept denying. I gave up. I gave myself sa iyaha on our very first night together. I felt bad and sad because he had it easy on me. He said even before we met, we already trusted each other and had a very deep connection so I shouldnt feel bad. He already loved me before he met me. I was still in denial. We became official that night.

So we became official, cgeg kita every weekend. Sometime di sha kaantos, he would go to our office para lang magkita mi before my shift. He was so into me. I feel it. I saw it. Very weekend magkita, mangaon, mag check in. Still on me. We became obsessed with each other. Until he confessed his love for me. Took me a while to admit it. We had a very loving, romantic, intense and thrill relationship because no one knows that I got myself a new boyfriend. I wanted it lowkey because I wanna make sure nga okay amoang relationship, nga way manghilabot and I saw that he's the man I'm gonna marry. Hinay2x I started to tell a few of my closest friends nga naa na koy uyab and they were so happy for me. Everything was perfect until I found out that he has a girlfriend for six years and live in pa. Nahugno akoang kalibutan kay wala ko kahibaw, and I was so mad at myself kay nahimo kong pareha sa babaye nga maoy reason nganong nagbuwag mi sa akong first bf. I became a third party, the kind of person I curse the most. And at the same time, I hated him because he was also cheating on me at the same time. 💔

So what happened is I broke up with him. But he doesnt want that. He loves me and he broke up with the girl. He never stopped chasing me even if I kept pushing him away. And girl cgeg pangaway nako through messenger kay I destroyed her life kuno. I remained respectful sa iyaha and apologized coz I didnt know. She knows I didnt know because according to her, it wasnt the first time the guy cheated on her. She was not even surprised nga naay uyab lain si G. What surprised her is that G broke up with her for me, to be with me. Mao nang iyaha kong gi cgeg away. I just kept telling her nga if gusto ka mu stay si G nimo, give him money, win him back, ask him to marry him, beg, kneel, tanang mga desperate na advice akong gihatag niya coz di na ko mudawat sa guy. She said she will do it. And then the next day, mu message nga she did ask him those but pushed her back because Im the one he loves. That scenario happened 3 times. It was the very first time he felt true love sa six years nilang together at that time. He has been cheating on her since day 1 nila. In fact, the girl was a third party and she was aware. Sa tanang babaye nga niagi ni G, she even impregnated two women while sila anang uyab nila, he fell inlove with me. Wala jud sila nagkabuwag sa babaye kay di man mubiya niya. It was the first time nga nagbuwag sila and the guy initiated the breakup. He never stopped persuading me. We all had a clean slate and a fresh start kay ni give up ang girl and even gave me her blessings twice if ever dawaton nako si G. Ako on my end, I loved him and I gave him a chance because I saw how perseverant he was. Nagbalik mi. We fixed things, became stronger and happier. The girl moved out sa apt nila taud2x na and he started bringing me sa apt niya. I wasnt comfy at first kay wala ko kasuway anang live in or sleepover tag 2 or 3 days. He wanted me to live with him but wala ko nisugot. Pero ni sugot ko nga mu stay sa apt niya for days. Started lying sa akong fam kung asa na ko tig katog. We were very happy and steady. Until I found out nga ga cge pa diay sila sa ex niya. 💔

For the past weeks, gosh, she’s not eating a lot. She was even drinking around 10 coffee a day clearly to suppress hanger. I also noticed she lost a lot of weight. It’s clearly triggering as f*uck.

J. Manney} where the FMC is working at a coffee shop and the MMC comes in looking very polished and telling other people what to do, and the FMC has a mild assumption that he is the leader of a mafia or gang or something, it doesn't go for that idea all that hard though. I'm looking for a book where she is CONVINCED he is mafia or a gang member or something, like hard core thinks that because supernaturals don't exist. Except he is a werewolf and has a pack, or vampire and has a nest, or whatever it is. Something where she thinks she has it all figured out but is thrown for a loop when she is actually told or shown what is really happening. I'd also be down for the opposite, she thinks he is a werewolf because things are so odd, but he is actually a mafia member, I just doubt that one has been written as of yet. I'm also cool with all gender configurations.

I really only have one thing I shy away from, and that is if any member in a relationship is cruel unnecessarily to anyone else in the relationship. So bully romance fine as long as the bullies are someone else. I also have a problem with lying, and substance abuse, though those can have exceptions. Anything else should be okay.

Celsius has just started to go international. They are starting with the UK, France, Australia and New Zealand as the first new market. What makes Celsius going international exciting is that it is essentially a flavored carbonated green tea. Most of the World has been traditionally tea drinkers. Coffee and Monsters are a relatively new fad in most countries. So Celsius going international has the advantage of being a more familiar product to the UK and Chinese consumer for example. They are also part of the Pepsi supply chain so they will not have to build their own in every country they launch in. Pepsi has enough skin in Celsius to want them to succeed and will share their internal marketing and business knowledge to keep Celsius from making mistakes during launches.

Buying the Alani Nu brand has so far been a success. What’s exciting about the brand is that it has yet to truly be marketed. Once Celsius puts real marketing dollars behind the product it could truly take off. Celsius has been very smart with their marketing buying up end caps in stores and doing product placement on podcast. Vice President JD Vance and Theo Vonn even made some jokes about it during a viral moment on Vonn’s podcast. This is marketing you can’t pay for!

As I mentioned in my last post Starbucks remains its largest competitor. They are even launching what is basically a Celsius knockoff. With similar ingredients, branding and even the can looks similar! While it’s added competition it does confirm that sugar free tea based energy drinks are the future. However I’m not worried because Starbucks has never put proper marketing behind its in store products. Instead they just put their product on shelves expecting them to sell because they have the Starbucks logo on them.

Overall Celsius still has string financials. Growth will now largely be determined by international sales which I feel could be explosive. It’s all going to be about effective marketing internationally.",0,1753658931.0,Stocks_Picks,0,0.5,False

1mb0tuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyRecommendation/comments/1mb0tuo/can_you_eat_after_whitening_strips/,Can You Eat After Whitening Strips?,"# If you're using whitening strips like Crest Whitestrips or professional whitening gels like Enlighten, you’ve probably heard conflicting advice about whether you can eat normally or whether you need to avoid everything but chicken, rice, and bananas for two weeks straight.

After digging through a ton of Reddit threads, here's a practical helpful answers for you:

**Why You Might Need to Be Careful After Whitening**

Most whitening products use **hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide**, which temporarily softens enamel and opens the “pores” in your teeth. During this window (typically a few hours after use), your teeth are **more prone to staining**, especially from strongly pigmented foods and drinks.

**So, Can You Eat After Whitening?**

**Yes, but with some caveats.** You don’t need to starve or radically overhaul your diet, but for best results, follow these tips:

#  DO:

* **Wait at least 30 minutes after treatment** before eating or drinking.  
* Drink **water** freely.  
* Eat light-colored, non-acidic foods (e.g., chicken, white rice, plain pasta).  
* Brush and floss regularly (but not immediately after acidic meals).  

# AVOID right after whitening (for 1–2 hours):

* Coffee, tea, red wine  
* Tomato-based sauces  
* Curries, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar  
* Berries, dark sodas, green smoothies  
* Smoking or vaping  
* Colored mouthwashes  

Some users say they drink coffee or eat normally during whitening cycles with no noticeable issues **especially if their teeth are already white and they rinse or brush soon after eating.** But results may vary.

**Do You Need to Follow the “White Diet”?**

Some whitening kits (like Enlighten) include a **“white diet” list**, warning against everything from broccoli to chocolate. This diet is often **overly restrictive** and, according to some **dentists and dental professionals on Reddit**, unnecessary if you’re practicing basic hygiene and using the products at night.

A dental nurse on Reddit explained:

“The main risk is staining right after whitening, which is why we suggest doing it in the evening. You don’t need to change your whole diet.”

**How Long Should You Use Whitening Strips?**

* **Follow the instructions on the box.** Some kits are 3, 7, or 14 days long.  
* Most people **stop early** if they see good results or experience sensitivity.  
* For maintenance, some users whiten **once every few months or yearly.**  

# Final Thoughts:

* Yes, you can eat after whitening, just avoid dark-staining foods/drinks **right afterward**.  
* You don’t need to follow a strict “white diet” unless instructed by your dentist for a specific treatment.  
* If in doubt, **rinsing your mouth** or brushing 30 minutes after eating goes a long way.  
* Don't sacrifice your morning coffee unless you really want optimal results fast. Many people drink it with a straw or rinse after.",1,1753658849.0,BeautyRecommendation,0,1.0,False

1mb0smu,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusesurvivors/comments/1mb0smu/i_got_double_darvoed_last_night/,I got double darvoed last night,"Background:

I am a girl, and have a friend (I now use this term lightly) let’s call him Joe who I’ve known for about 15 years. He introduced me to his friend Eric about six years ago. 

I’m closer with Joe than I am with Eric, and once or twice a month the three of us hang out.

Overtime I noticed that Eric is very demanding when we are together. We watch what he wants, only play the music he wants, we go where he wants, he doesn’t so much say please or thank you, he demands we cook for him. 

I don’t give into these demands as easily as Joe does. Then once Eric isn’t around, Joe will complain about him. It’s like a petulant child. 

I’m the type of person, especially in threes, I don’t talk about the other person when once isn’t present, except if it’s a sentiment I will and have said to their face.

There have been instances where if I speak up, it’s not acknowledged. 

One time Eric got too drunk and I wouldn’t let him drive, so I allowed him to crash in my guest room. He puked in my toilet so much that it caused issues. He grumpily went to my guest bed, demanded bread and soda from me like a servant, didn’t thank me. He crashed over night, left the guest room a mess, my roommate offered him coffee, he ignored her and left.

This is a common theme with him and when I politely say, can we just all consider sharing what we all want to do, basic manners 101? 

One time he tripped on mushrooms and his demands and barking orders got to be too much. Joe plays doormat. When I wasn’t even allowed to play one song. I said,”Eric you need to stop telling us what to do all the time.” 

He seemed to understand, gave us a hug and that was that for now.

Last year was my birthday. I got reservations for a nice restaurant in the city and Eric just acted immature, burped loud, said out loud,”I just took the most satisfying dump,” and other dinner guests looked at me like,”Wow that’s embarrassing.” 

He makes demands on my birthday, eats my cake before we cut the cake, and we were staying at a loft and he just falls on my bed with his shoes on and crashes. He didn’t shower and he had his own place to sleep. He complains the whole night. I bite my tongue feeling so disrespected and meanwhile as usual Joe is drunk and messy. 

Joe however complains plenty about Eric to me when Eric isn’t around. Real mature. Again, if I bring up anything about Eric to Joe, it’s only things I’ve said to Eric’s face. I don’t twoface and backstab people. But Joe stirs the pot and gives his drunk biased view on me and Joes private business without me even having a chance to say my side. I don’t involve Eric in me and Joes business, because it gets messy. Eric doesn’t care and only fends for whatever Joe says.

Joe never confronts Eric, but I have, and when I do it’s met with Darvo. I don’t even point out half the crap and entitled shit he says and does. I’ve cooked for him he doesn’t say thank you and just doesn’t finish it and throws it in the sink. 

When I speak, they don’t hear me. When I request something, they ignore me. 

In our group chat after my birthday, Eric continued whining about I don’t even know and said some poor taste joke about 9/11. I couldn’t take it.

All I did, was send him about 3 paragraphs saying how his inconsideration for others is really draining and it never changes, how it put a damper on my birthday, when I try to appease them and go with the flow. I was humiliated at the restaurant, you didn’t let us relax you just care about you. 

That was enough for me to be blocked. Eric later said,”She attacked me, I did nothing wrong, she’s so angry, I’ve had people attack me like that and she was out of line to talk to me like that.” 

Then Joe felt in the middle and they ended up both saying,”Why are YOU complaining so much?” Then they both are so offended I even spoke against Eric’s behavior, treatment and disregard towards me more so than Joe….they ended up teaming up and acting so butthurt I spoke up against their behavior. 

I stayed at a distance for a long while. Joe being a functioning drunk who gets very loud, defensive, worry wart, catastrophic in his demeanor and overly anxious and manifests more shit to snowball than it has to. In the past that has lead to rage, which has in turn resulted in many women not feeling safe around him. There’s only so much of trying to diffuse him when he gets like this I can take. 

That brings us to last night. 

Joe has a habit of buying or planning grand expensive things, that he knows I can’t afford, and INSISTS, usually in attempt to make up for his poor decisions and judgement. To everyone he knows. 

I’ve told him millions of times, buying things for people isn’t the solution. Conflict resolution communication should get to the root of an issue only. 

I have until I’m blue in the face said,”NO, please I will pay for myself, please no, I don’t want you to pay for me.” 

I have never gotten a hand out in my life except for maybe a college grant; and I like it that way.

Because I feel gross accepting people paying for me. I am a full time caretaker of my surviving parent and so I haven’t been able to work for a few months. 

Eric has taken advantage and felt entitled for Joe to pay for him. Many people have taken advantage of Joe for his grand offers of spending money. 

Joe bought tickets to a concert with three bands. He didn’t ask, he demanded me and Eric go. I said I’d pay for mine and he went on about how I deserve it, and I had a bad feeling. I said, maybe take someone else, and he was like,”It won’t be the same without you, please come, I insist this is my treat.”

I reluctantly accepted, and so did Eric. 

Earlier in the week, there was a death in the family. 
My health hasn’t been doing well. My immune systems shut down and stress has kept me from having my period. I finally got it this weekend, and it took a lot out of me. 

We get to the venue, I wanted to see all three bands, Eric was hungry, Joe followed, we went to a restaurant, I thought it would be quick then we would go to the show.

Joe orders five very strong and different alcoholic drinks. I chime in and say,”How are we doing on time?” I gently reminded them we are gunna be late. “We have plenty of time…it’s fine…” I was told. I mentioned checking the time a few times but was ignored. I offered to go early to grab a spot in line (the line was gone by then because everyone was in) and they insisted we stay together. 

They took their sweet time just goofing around as Joe is getting plastered. I ordered a small plate, and yeah this place was mad expensive. I didn’t even plan on eating. I was money shamed for not ordering more and Joe was getting angry because I didn’t order more food for myself. Eric was being his usual rude self. A regular occurrence when we go out to eat. Rude to staff, has no manners or proper etiquette. In your 30’s it’s humiliating. Joe may be drunk but he’s not as rude in restaurants. I Venmo my part of the bill. Eric doesn’t pay, he leaves the rest to Joe. 

They’re both pretty well off and have rich parents. I’m quite the opposite. I worked for all I have. Frugality isn’t something they understand.

As we leave the restaurant, Eric demands we go to a 7-11 for ice cream, then back to Joes car. Meanwhile both of them saying,”I care about this one band the least so I don’t care if we miss it.” 

I said I wanted to see them though but no one heard me. I couldn’t walk very far so I sat outside where they went to the car. In the distance I hear the band playing, knowing we have already missed a third of the concert and the band I wanted to see the most. I was just sad.

As we approach the venue, Joe starts ranting and raving,”ILL TAKE THE BLAME FOR THIS, ITS MY FAULT.” Always plays the victim. 

He gets in my face and he’s like,”WHATS WRONG WHAT IS IT WHAT DID I DO THIS TIME?!?!” 

I quietly say, nothing let’s just go in. He starts getting all intense and acting belligerent. At that point I just freeze in my face and don’t say a word. All I said was,”We missed the band, let’s just go in and enjoy the show.” I may have visibly looked a bit sad, and the delay for me having to get my bag checked for another 30 bucks was annoying. It was whatever…

We all went in and sat down, I was kind of stone faced for a couple minutes because I froze in response to the male yelling. 

Eric gets up and goes off somewhere without warning then Joe follows.

I’m left there by myself even right after we sat down. 20 minutes go by. I get up to look for them because there’s no service. 

I find Joe in the smoking area, and he gets in my face again and is yelling, saying,”I ALWAYS FUCK UP DONT I?! DONT I!!!!!????” Meanwhile I am sitting looking at the ground. 

“LOOK AT ME WHEN IM SPEAKING TO YOU!!!” He shouted. I quietly said,”No.”

“EXCUSE ME?!?!? EXCUSE ME?!?!?” He shouts in my face almost spitting as others are looking at us.

I said,”Let’s just not talk about it and go enjoy the show.” Just to shut it down. I got up and returned to my seat.

Another half hour goes by and neither one of them come to see the show. I once again get up to look for them, and they’re both in the smokers pit. 

I know by now that they spent this whole time based on the looks on their faces scapegoating me, why? I don’t know. 

Eric suddenly shouts at me at the top of his lungs, verbally assaulting me,”SHUT UP, YOU UNGRATEFUL BITCH, SITTING THERE LIKE A SAD DISNEY PRINCESS, JOE PAID FOR THESE TICKETS AND THIS IS THE SHIT YOU PULL?!? YOU NEED TO BE PUT IN YOUR FUCKING PLACE. HE HAS DONE A LOT FOR YOU AND PAID FOR YOU FOR THIS! LOOK INWARD YOURE SUCH A FUCKING BALL OF SUNSHINE!! YOU ARE SO DEMANDING AND HARD TO PLEASE.” 

Mind you Eric willingly freeloads. I don’t. Because they use it for amo to hold over you. 

Joe chimes in and it’s two men SHOUTING AT ME. I was shaking, my head was spinning, and then Joe starts staring slanderous lies to pile on me as Eric shouts at me. I didn’t say or do anything.

If I had I would have acknowledged and apologized. I rather own my faults or mistakes, but replaying this I don’t understand. I just froze. I wasn’t being dramatic, with that sad disney princess comment. 

I tried to get an uber home but had no service.

They continued watching the concert like nothing happened. I silently hid my tears so they wouldn’t detect it and yell at me again. 

I don’t drink alcohol, I was pressured into drinking, and I didn’t. 

After the concert was over, Joe tried to drive and I said,”you’re not driving you’re drunk.” Eric was going to drive.

I was silent. I didn’t receive an apology. I was told they can speak to me any way they want. 

Joe fired Eric up and involved and triangulated our business from his biased, drunk, slanderous, lying view point and Joe used that as further ammo to pile on me as Eric demeaned me on the way home. 

Between me and Eric, ive always been chill around him but given his behavior I try to be stoic, strategic, and walked on eggshells. There have only been two instances where we had a spat, my birthday last year when I messaged him, and this time because I looked “sad” and was disappointed. 

I didn’t even get to tell him how self centered and inconsiderate he is. I didn’t yell. I just said this was irreparable. Joe made up lies as their ganging up intensified. Two drama kings who act entitled said I brought drama. I asked for an example. 

Eric said one time in the group chat I said,”What, no invite? Pshhh.” About an event. I was being playful, and I didn’t even remember it. I didn’t take them going to an event to heart, I was just playing and they should have known it wasn’t anything other than lighthearted. 

And how I pointed out Eric and Joes treatment of me. Over a year ago.

That’s it.

Oh and I looked sad.

I can’t help but feel this is projection. Other women have felt this way about Joe especially.

I haven’t eaten, I feel sick. And earlier this week Joe was drunk and punched my right shoulder and stole my keys. To keep me from leaving.

….

I just needed to get this out. I feel gaslit and darvoed. But still I feel like me looking sad and them going off to talk shit about a misconceived notion, snowballed and escalated their own irrational anger and took it out on me. I did nothing. 

P.S. in the last decade most of my best friends died, including my fiancé and my father. I also was raped. I just feel suicidal. There’s only so much of this I can take. ",1,1753658758.0,abusesurvivors,0,1.0,False

What makes Celsius going international exciting is that it is essentially a flavored carbonated green tea. Most of the World has been traditionally tea drinkers. Coffee and Monsters are a relatively new fad in most countries. So Celsius going international has the advantage of being a more familiar product to the UK and Chinese consumer for example. They are also part of the Pepsi supply chain so they will not have to build their own in every country they launch in. Pepsi has enough skin in Celsius to want them to succeed and will share their internal marketing and business knowledge to keep Celsius from making mistakes during launches.

Buying the Alani Nu brand has so far been a success. What’s exciting about the brand is that it has yet to truly be marketed. Once Celsius puts real marketing dollars behind the product it could truly take off. Celsius has been very smart with their marketing buying up end caps in stores and doing product placement on podcast. Vice President JD Vance and Theo Vonn even made some jokes about it during a viral moment on Vonn’s podcast. This is marketing you can’t pay for!

As I mentioned in my last post Starbucks remains its largest competitor. They are even launching what is basically a Celsius knockoff. With similar ingredients, branding and even the can looks similar! While it’s added competition it does confirm that sugar free tea based energy drinks are the future. However I’m not worried because Starbucks has never put proper marketing behind its in store products. Instead they just put their product on shelves expecting them to sell because they have the Starbucks logo on them.

Overall Celsius still has a strong balance sheet. Growth will now largely be determined by international sales which I feel could be explosive. It’s all going to be about effective marketing internationally.",2,1753658747.0,stockstobuytoday,0,1.0,False

I've been on 20mg for about 7.5 months now and I've had a sudden relapse in anxiety symptoms and what my doctor believes are breakthrough panic attacks. They have given me Hydroxyzine for as needed anxiety but it's so sedating that it's a last resort for me to take. That being said, here is my current issue.  
  
I keep having recurrent episodes where I get incredibly nauseous, dizzy, red hot and sweaty with a heart rate around 130bpm. I'm trying to find a trigger for this and the most recent episode it happened when I was forced to work overnight suddenly and stay up for around 35 hours without sleep. Around 3am I felt unbelievably sick and had to run off to a quiet place with a fan for over an hour before I could stop heavy breathing and feeling like I was going to be vomit. 



This exact same thing has happened 5 times now and the only common thing I can find is Caffeine. What makes no sense is that I've always been a heavy caffeine consumer with energy drinks and coffee. Can I suddenly develop an intolerance to caffeine? The symptoms align with so many different things but serotonin syndrome is one that Im curious if high intake of caffeine could cause or if this really is me needing to go up in dosage of Prozac to handle random anxiety attacks.

  
TLDR: Keep getting symptoms of what could be serotonin syndrome, doctor things it's just panic attacks from caffeine intake and needing to up my Prozac dosage. Not sure what symptoms mean what and looking for guidance.",1,1753658717.0,prozac,3,1.0,False

**Salaam Everyone,** 

First of all, Thanks to Allah Almighty and the prayers of my loved ones, that I passed, and thanks to everyone here for giving sound advice and for helping each other with even the smallest issues. I am writing this as a way to give back. 

**Background:** 

Non-US IMG, MBBS Graduate

**Study Duration:** 

\~5 Months 

**Resources Used:**

* Sketchy Medical (MY MAIN RESOURCE, all of it, Sketchy Micro, Path, Pharm, Anatomy, Physio, Immuno, Biochem)
* Pixorize: only selective some sketches which i did not find in SketchyMedical
* uWorld Qbank did 82%
* Bootcamp lectures for Anatomy/Physio of some Systems
* PHYSEO videos for Anatomy, Physio, General Pharm, General Micro, Biostats.
* Pathoma Chapter 1-3 
* NBME 15,19,20,21 and 24-31, F120, Bootcamp SA
* Mehlman Neuroanatomy, Genetics, Arrows, Risk Factors, MSK
* Randy Neil Biostats (MUST) and Genetics

**How I studied:** 

I started with uWorld and Sketchy. I would do one system, Sketchy Path and Pharm, and start uWorld while doing anatomy/physio from uWorld wrongs and learning through it. If I went towards completing whole system (incl anatomy/path) first then uWorld, then I would waste many days. So, this strategy of doing incomplete systems and completing them with uWorld worked for me. While doing uWorld, sometimes I would see Bootcamp videos for Anatomy/Physio of that system if i would get more wrong (I did this for CVS and Pulm, Bootcamp videos for these two systems were TOP-Notch). 

Did NBME 15 really early to assess what the exam was going to be like. I would highly recommend this to anyone, instead of being afraid of the exam for too long and wasting tons of time in uWorld or mindless revisions. Instead get an orientation from NBME and revise through it with more focus. 

Did uWorld \~65% then incorporated NBMEs into prep. Now I was fed up with uWorld, and started fixing my minor subjects and Anatomy/Physio through PHYSEO and Sketchy Anatomy/Physio/Immuno. Pathoma Chapter 1-3 after Sketchy Immuno really helped in score improvement. 

Left uWorld at 82% (did around 76% and made some blocks which i never finished), found uWorld useless at some point. it is highly recommended to give NBME early and focus on NBME ONLY related prep late in prep.

Last month was NBME and review and fixing anatomy physio i left earlier, fixing repro, endo, neuro, & micro. 

**\[I did not use FA, as reading book was too much for me, tried many times but couldn't.\]** 

  
**Exam Day Tips:**

This reddit post helps with test room tips a lot: [https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/15a2hkf/test\_room\_tips/](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/15a2hkf/test_room_tips/)

* Just get enough sleep (I got 7 hours)
* Never take pills for sleep unless you've been taking early on as well. I thought about it a lot, even took bromazepalm and zolpidem before some NBMEs but felt i shouldn't before Real Exam.  
* 2 days before exam sleep ONLY 2-3 hrs and wake up at around 3-4AM in the morning (**Really imp**), the day before exam. Now tire yourself out, study, workout, walks, just not an ounce of rest. 
* Sleep like a log around 10PM night before exam. 
* Take a Water Bottle (Transparent with Logo removed) for taking inside Exam room.
* Take things to eat, Protein stuff, which can fill you, Coffee/Tea in a flask. 
* I took breaks after every 2 blocks, not to over saturate the mind, time your breaks early on. 
* block #1, 2-5 min break on desk, block #2, 10 mins for washroom, eating sth, tea. repeat.
* Give yourself peptalks inside the exam, (advice by Randy neil), You're gonna see Qs out of the World too, tell yourself they're experimental, tick any option, mark them and move on, at the end of block solve them if you have time. if you focus on them early on, you're gonna miss out on the Qs you know really well. 
* Q stems will be longer than any NBME, more close to new Free120 and Bootcamp SA, answers might be vague but if you passed NBME, you'll know how to get the best answer.
* The exam is more of making the BEST EDUCATED GUESS than memorisation. Mehlman Youtube Qbank videos help in this regard. 

**Mehlman:**

This man says the truth about Steps. He knows the test and test taker's mindset.

* His PDFs are solid for review. Neuroanatomy, Arrows and RF are the best.
* HY Neuroanatomy: covered almost everything in exam/NBME
* HY Arrows: seems simple, but covers most of physio, anatomy concepts which we miss, MUST DO.
* Risk factors: exam had many ditto same to same Qs from this.
* Do his PDF inflate scores in NBMEs?
* No. If you have learnt stuff from main resources and are reviewing and taking concepts not just memorising which Q comes like what then Answer is no, they donot inflate, they just consolidate the topics tested more in NBME/Step1 in your head and you score more in NBME. Because uWorld/Amboss do the same thing, pick a Q from NBME and make a closely resembling Q and when you do NBME you answer it correct.   
* Yes. If you just do only his PDF and nothing else, and start memorising answers to questions.
* My Advice: to be out of this paradox, do 50-70% prep then give 1-2 early NBME as baseline, see if you're above 50-60%, do his PDFs, this way you'll know you're pass regardless.
* **Mehlman Youtube Qbank Videos** are recommended late in prep as they make you learn how to deduce the answer even if you dont know the answer. They teach how to think, which is very very important in this exam.

**Sketchy:**

THE MVP. THIS IS THE BEST RESOURCE for a person who has a visual memory. I did sketchy to pass my annual professional exams in Medical School and now it helped the most in Step1.

* Sketchy Micro: you donot need anything else to handle every micro Q in exam/nbme. F uWorld for giving such tough micro. General Micro should be done from PHYSEO though.
* Sketchy Path: THE BEST. Covers almost everything.  \[I have no idea why people not use this enough.\]
* Sketchy Pharm: you donot need anything else to handle every pharm Q except the drugs not in sketchy pharm. 
* Sketchy Immuno: it seemed less yield the first time but man, it builds such strong foundation, supplement it with Pathoma ch 1-3, damn, THIS HELPS YOU ANSWER most path Qs even if you dont know the answer, you can dissect it from the info given. 
* Sketchy Biochem: again this handles every Q in exam, mainly vitamins, and pathways, but it is really detailed, needs to be done minimum 3 times. 
* Sketchy Anatomy: thought it was useless at first but when i left uWorld, and found anatomy weak, i started it, and it really helped me. 
* Sketchy Physio:  Not good standalone, but use it with physeo or bootcamp as foundation and it helps you memorise. 

A trick to do sketchy faster:

First time you can see sketchy videos at 1.5-2x. then to revise you just use any good media player on Laptop to start videos at 12-15x with muted sound and let it run, pause with space button if you dont know any point, read it fast and move on. this way you can even revise whole sketchy path in 2-3 days. 

**Some Subject Wise Detailed:**

* CVS: I wish I had done arrythmias, and revised CVS (which I couldn't due to burnout at the end)**,** Exam tested ECGs and CVS a lot.
* Ethics: uWorld is the best resource for this. DirtyMedicine has good youtube videos as well. Summarise the points. This page has good comments for last minute ethics: [https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1b2z07y/last\_minute\_ethics\_principles\_rules/](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1b2z07y/last_minute_ethics_principles_rules/)
* Biostats: Randy Neil (main 2 videos) + PHYSEO **+** practice through uWorld = enough
* General Pharm: PHYSEO
* Micro: Sketchy Micro + PHYSEO general micro
* Biochem Genetics: Sketchy covers everything, needs tons of revision, Mehlman PDF is good.
* MSK: Do not go vast into anatomy(like insertions of muscles), only HY and basic things will be asked, do mehlman PDF if you want, do NBME related study of it. 
* Neuroanatomy: Mehlman PDF is best resource for this. 

**MY FINAL TAKE:**

This exam is more psychological than knowledge based, they want to assess if you can handle the pressure, the burnouts, the long Q stems, vague answers, and still make yourself stand firm and tackle it.

This is the reason almost everyone comes out of exam and feels like failed but they pass. i felt the same after most NBME as well. Trust your hardwork and trust NBME scores, and most of all, Trust your maker, Allah Almighty, if He put you on this path, He would also help you succeed, make tons of prayers, ask Him for success, He is the only One who can  help, have faith, try your best and then leave it to Allah. It'll work out inshaAllah. 

**Link to:**

* My Biochem and Immuno FA annotated with Sketchy photos (which I ended up not using)
* PDF of Every Q & topic asked in NBME 20,21,24-29 (The \*asterisk shows how many times this topic is tested in above mentioned NBMEs) This PDF is good for revision after you have done NBME 29 (**not before**)
* NBME Offline Score Calculator PDF i got from a post in Reddit (not mine)

1mb0nmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mb0nmi/the_exchange_by_oliver_kane/,The Exchange by Oliver Kane,"**Years after the fact, one man recalls the haunting events of his first bartending job.**

 

The Gold Exchange, a looming relic of the Gold Rush era, stands proudly in a small city in Colorado. Once a bustling hub of trade, now a grand old hotel, it exudes the mystery and faded luxury of another age. Locals call it a monument. Devin calls it a paycheck.

Behind the bar, Devin learns the ropes, forges friendships, and falls in love. But beneath the ornate ceilings and polished brass lies something ancient and incomprehensible—a slithering entity of stone, illusion, and void. Older than the building. Older than the bedrock itself.

As Devin slips deeper into the hotel’s grip, reality begins to unravel. Friends change. Time bends. And a voice older than memory whispers from the walls.

You don’t leave the Gold Exchange.  
Not whole.

  
**The Exchange:**

This is a story from a few years back, from when I got my first bartending job. Thought I’d put it here. I’m a full-on, swanky bartender now; I serve rich old folks their last hundred or so martinis at a golf club—as well as the odd tech millionaire or local politician. Monetarily, it’s a fine living (the dying and the rich tip surprisingly well) but it’s boring…and oddly solitary. It’s different from any of the watering holes I worked in downtown Denver, with all the sweaty, loud, and at times pernicious people hopped up on freedom and stupidity. I miss being around people my age, I suppose, but I’d take being bored around old people that know my name over witnessing social degeneration under a microscope. Bar fights, groping, attempts at drugging, flirting turned to cheating. Once, I saw a guy sucking on some random woman’s tits right in the middle of the dance floor, like a giant infant. I mean, no tact, no cheeky trip to the bathroom—just right out in the open. They got thrown out, of course, but I like to think he’s still suckling to this day.

I’m getting off track…

It may be boring, but a golf club bar is much more well-lit than a bumping club, and it squeezes many fewer gyrating bodies together. It holds less objects for shadows to grow from and casts its space in light, rather than *his* frantic beings. After what happened to me, and to Addy…I need both of those things.

When I was twenty-one and in my third year of college, I lost the part-time job I’d had at a pet store. I was smoking a hell of a lot of weed at that time in my life, and though I doubt the cats, dogs, or hamsters cared all that much, the management did, and I came in a few too many times smelling like cheap grass. I needed a job, however, having moved from Denver to Colorado Springs for college, leaving my family and their security. Because I loved to drink as well, I thought bartending would be a good angle for a part-time money-maker. I dressed my best, printed out my meager resume, and pounded the pavement downtown. After ten or twelve places all but laughed me out of their fine establishments, I tried an old hotel called The Gold Exchange. They took me on as a bar-back—a bartender’s helper-monkey—but they said that in a few months I could be trained and put onto the real job.

It was a local place, rather than any national or statewide franchise, remodeled from a hub where mine owners, businessmen, and anyone with a tall enough hat would meet and exchange stocks and cigar smoke. It was acquired by one John L. Garland in the roaring twenties, who turned it into a hotel for more of the tall-hat people, but was left abandoned in the first year of The Great Depression. It remained vacant save for unfortunates for ten years, then exchanged hands three times with no progress against its dilapidation, before finally being purchased by a young millionaire who’d come back from the Western Front and invented some sort of kitchen gadget that sold like hot-cakes.

So, there it stood: the very same stone that men had erected before there were electric lights and television sets and lobotomized wives. The mid-twentieth-century amenities and décor—some borrowed from France and Germany—did not clash with the chiseled beige stonework or the too-small hallways or the faded statue of Robert Miller Womack, the man responsible for the Cripple Creek gold rush; rather, the amalgamation worked to meld the area’s gold and silver mining past with post-war consumption and excess, and it did it well. All this, I learned in a tour I was forced to attend upon hire. They were apparently still quite proud of the hotel’s history, though the young millionaire who’d saved it from a wrecking ball had been dead for nearly forty years. Those facts were cool if you were a history nerd or a little kid with mineshaft dreams, but to me it didn’t matter at all.

I worked in the lobby lounge day-to-day, and when they needed an extra hand or three for banquets and galas and the like, I washed glasses, cut fruit, and refilled ice bins for ten hours straight. I’m not generally a nervous person, but I felt more than a little on my first shift, given the fanciness of the place, the people I worked with, and the people we served. The first person I met there, other than the hiring manager and the tour guide, was a small blonde woman named Addison. The second was a tall, skinny guy named Rich. Together, they ran the lobby bar. They were fast, efficient, yet also artful in making cocktails, and the vast majority of the time, they were entirely professional.

At first, they made me more anxious, but when the customers weren’t around, that façade dropped away and they were just college kids like me. Addison was working the evening shift to pay for a biology degree; Rich a degree in finance. During lulls, we talked about TV shows and video games and the weather and pretty much anything else we could. We complained about our superiors, about the night shifters and the day shifters, and about the customers, of course. In a matter of hours that first day, I knew I’d picked the right line of work and the right establishment in that line of work. They washed any anxiety from me, and it wasn’t long until the three of us were truly friends. Rich and I bonded over Poker and our love of cars, among other things. Five or six times, we’d trekked up to the tiny old mining town of Cripple Creek, hosing the house for their chips and using the proceeds to buy cocktails we’d make fun of. The three of us, as well as Rich’s younger sister Miranda, had gone on two or three camping trips during the summer and fall: the beauty of nature and the beauty of friendship pulling me from my old habits and populating my new life with purpose and a lingering sense of positivity, a sense I could do anything.

I was happy.

The trouble began three months into my being there. Christmas was just around the corner, and with it, the Colorado winter rolled right in. Gone were 60-degree November days where you could stand in the direct sun, close your eyes, and believe summer was more than a ghost. Here now were ice storms and bitter winds that cut through everything you put on, cut right to your bones, so it took hours to recover from the chill. It was far from insufferable though; not when you had silver tinsel and warm yellow lights on every tree, real or fake; not when old Christmas songs fell out of every speaker and seemed to collect in the corners of rooms and in people’s hearts; and not when the smell of warm spices, crackling logs, and cashmere dominated every room.

Addison and I had begun dating just before Halloween, which helped as well to lift the mood of my life. When I first started the job, I hadn’t seen or sensed any interest or flirtation from her, though I’ve always found it hard to tell for sure. In the middle of fall, however, I caught her eyes lingering on me from time to time, the slightest rosy flush underneath a laugh when I would put on my deep “Southern-Charmer” voice. So, when I mustered up my courage, I asked her if she’d go to a haunted house with me—dinner afterward. She said she’d love to, as long as I didn’t mind her fingernails trying to dig at the bones of my forearm. She did, indeed, clutch hard when masked men with chain-saws and axes came revving and swinging out of hidden passages. We screamed and laughed, and at one scare, she jumped nearly into my arms. We shared a kiss that night, and for weeks thereafter, I found it almost impossible to work near her without hugging her to me or spinning her about in a dance.

That was fun, but our relationship began to truly temper—to form into something real—as we shared our backstories. I’m an orphan; someone that was genetically my mother swaddled me in a faded Bronco’s jersey and plopped me down in front of a firehouse in downtown Denver. The foster care system treated me a lot better than it does many others: a loving family of three that have been mine since I was fourteen months old. From them I received education and opportunity, and especially love, rather than abuse and neglect that might have left me to wander out on my own before I was at all fledged. Even by the time I’d graduated high school, I’d worked through any abandonment issues.

Addison was not also an orphan. Not in common parlance, anyway. Her mother had died of horribly metastasized pancreatic cancer when Addison was only seven, and her father had slunk slowly down a hole of grief, becoming more and more distant by the year. She recalled an evening when she was nine on which she prodded and begged her father to make dinner—this was after he’d missed picking her up from school, and she’d had to walk—but he only sat in his leather recliner, a forgotten Old-fashioned on the coffee table, nothing then but liquor scented water. She’d pulled at his leg, yelled at him, and cried, but he only sat and stared into blank space. The young Addison—inches shorter than the average nine-year-old—had clambered up on the counter to get to the phone, dialing a few numbers before finally getting her aunt Gina.

She’d lived with that same aunt Gina and her uncle Matthias for a little over four months, while her father stayed in a “hospital”; and though her father recovered somewhat, she said he was never right. They hadn’t kept in any standard father-daughter contact past her high school graduation, though she said she checked in on him once every few months. She cried telling me these things, and I hugged her: the most I could do to make it better. Trauma bonding seems to be very real and very strong.

When it got cold, she would make me hot drinks, and she always seemed to have something on hand when I wanted a snack. I would walk her to her car every night after our shift ended, and there were nights we talked about more positive things until the sun came up. She taught me most of what I know about bartending and mixology. She was intelligent and beautiful and as sweet as they come. Despite her past, she seemed somehow impervious to negativity and bad moods under day-to-day circumstances, so it surprised me to see her crying that night, the 21^(st) of December, I think it was.

“What’s wrong?” I asked, peeling my coat and gloves off. I placed them on the coat rack that stood in the corner of the little staff office behind the bar. She didn’t look up at me, but only sat in the chair with her head in her hands, her hair hanging down and obscuring her. I pushed the office door closed and went to her. “Addy? What’s wrong?”

It took me kneeling down and grasping her arms for her to acknowledge me, but she still wouldn’t look into my eyes. Our shift had only just begun: eight hours of pouring and shaking and making small talk with rich folks. If it hadn’t been something here—a customer or manager yelling at her or deriding her, a tray of drinks she had fumbled—then what? Something about her father? Something serious?

“Addison, you have to tell me what’s wrong. Please.”

She took in a long, wet breath and finally tilted her face up to mine, slowly lowering her hands. Generally, she wore only a little makeup, and that still held true that night. However, the little mascara there had run into four smoky tracks.

“Devin?” She asked it even more with her eyes. Though she saw me, and I was sure she had heard me, her eyes were distant, as if she were looking past me, pondering something.

“Yeah, I’m here. Why are you crying, baby?” I rubbed her upper arms with my thumbs.  

Her eyes focused and found my own. “I—I can’t talk about it right now,” she said. She checked her watch, then stood. I stood with her and held her arms lightly for a second more before she twisted softly away from me and went to her purse on the manager’s desk. Quickly, as if seconds ago she hadn’t been a puddle of hair and tears, she reached into her purse and retrieved makeup wipes, a small mirror, and a tube of mascara. She began to clean under her eyes, then to reapply the mascara. I stepped beside her, opened my mouth, then closed it. She’d gone from sobbing and unresponsive to entirely calm and collected in a matter of seconds. In the mirror, she finished one eye, then moved on to the other: fast, steady, efficient. Her mouth made no more expression than to draw down into an O to stretch the skin of her face and provide an even canvas. I was struck speechless until she began tossing all her tools back into her purse.

“Uh…Addison?” Zipping the purse closed, she shot her eyes toward me, bidding me to continue. “Are you alright?” She turned to me while fixing up her hair, and despite what had just occurred, I found myself placated, almost assured, by her posture and renewed face. It could have been that she’d never been doubled over in the chair, never been wrecked by some cocktail of emotions.

“I’ll be fine,” she said. “It was nothing.”

“Addy, that wasn’t nothing. You were crying.”

“Devin, I cry sometimes. You’ll get to know that about me.”

It was matter-of-fact, on the border of curt, and I stood dumbstruck, trying to form an adequate reply. She *didn’t* just ‘cry sometimes’. Before I got anything out, Addison stood on her toes and pecked my lips, then walked toward the shut office door.

“Addison.” She turned to face me, though in her eye was an odd impatience. “Addison, what *was* that? You seemed…broken.”

Her eyes held mine, but for half-a-second they flicked upward, above my head. “I can’t talk about it right now. I promise. We’ll talk about it tonight. Just not right now.”

Then she was gone, out the door and behind the bar, relieving the last shift and preparing to serve. Confused, I went to my small locker and got the watch I wore for work. It was so fancy and expensive—to a college kid, that is—that I never wanted to wear it outside the hotel, nor move it from place to place, in case I somehow lost it. I checked that my own clothes and hair were in order and went to the door. With my hand on the knob, a thought came to me, and I turned to see what Addison might have been looking at above my head. What I saw was not in the least revealing: the vacant black eye of the CCTV security camera that faced the door. Its little red light blinked at me six times before I’d turned the knob and left the room and the happening stuck within it.

Time slipped by like a wet eel. Addison and I didn’t talk much—not to each other, in any case. I’d been trained as a bartender by that point, and could more than hold down the fort. So, we smiled, shook drinks, and made conversation like two arms of a well-oiled machine.

“Fighting any cool cases?” Tanner Warren and old Mister Wellers had just sat down. I was ready with lemon-spiked waters, and a neat double of Scotch for the latter.

“We’re suing the ass off a group of hippies,” Tanner said. “They claim a chemical plant is dumping refuse nitric acid into a river. Dead fish and squirrels or something.” He tapped huge fingers into the bar-top. “High West on the rocks. And make it a fuckin’ triple.”  

I nodded and poured.

“We’ll get ‘em for damages,” Mr. Wellers said. “They keep throwing buckets of river-water on people.” He shook his head, then hauled up his Scotch with an old, shaking hand. “Shut down two blocks of 6^(th) Avenue right in front of the plant’s corporate office. These damn kids don’t have any respect.”

“Jesus,” I said. “Hope you win.” I didn’t. “What are you guys doing here in The Springs, then?”

“My lovely nephew,” Tanner Warren began, frustrated and sarcastic, “*shining* *gem* that he is, got himself into a spat with some girl a decade his junior. She says he drugged her in a bar.”

My eyebrows went up. “Brandon? No way.” There most assuredly was a way. Brandon Warren had graced my bar with his presence on a few occasions. I had heard his stories.  

“That’s what I said.” Tanner breathed out whiskey fumes, and I tried not to pull away. “He’s rough around the edges—that’s his father’s fault—but he’s a good kid.” Ice tinkled as he swigged from his drink. I’d have to get him another pour in perhaps ten minutes.

I heard Mrs. “Call me Catherine” Mayhew call my name from the other end of the bar and moved off with an “Excuse me, gentlemen.” She wanted the special cocktail I’d come up with for her, as well as to tell me all about what her sons and grandsons were up to.

Rich came in twenty minutes late—perks of being the newly promoted bar manager—and got to checking inventory. We all checked inventory, of course; the more minds you had on it, the less likely it was for someone to fuck up. Out of Lagavulin Sixteen Year when old Mister Wellers, senior partner at *Wellers, Lorraine & Warren*, wants his fix? Miss out on a fifty-dollar tip. Only an ounce left of Disaronno Amaretto? Can’t make Catherine Mayhew her favorite cocktail? Lose a \*hundred-\*dollar tip, and prettily flashed dentures.

Do I sound bitter? Shit, I just read it back: I do. I’m really not, but recalling this stuff isn’t exactly fun; nor, in hindsight, were the people I served as classy as their money and suits might make them seem. Unless being callous reprobates is synonymous with class.

In any case, Rich seemed in a bad mood that day. Not like Addison was, but when I said hi to him, he barely even nodded, then rushed past me, tracking snow and a bitter-cold puff of winter. His concert-black suit, normally impeccable—clean as a whistle and ironed to planar perfection—hung slightly wrinkled on him, and above the sticking snow at the hem of his pant legs, there was the hint of a reddish-brown dust. I only noticed it because of the more generally disparate state of his clothing and manner, but the fact he hadn’t cleaned it off stuck in my head. Rich was always obsessively clean; he detailed his car weekly; he was a tyrant when it came to bar management; his apartment was spotless and organized; and his body and mind seemed always in a similar state. Down to every hair on his head, my friend was constantly tidy and ordered, and it had served him well.

But in the past few months, he had been acting strangely. Chiefly toward myself and Addison. He was cool to us, if not cold, and he seemed far away. The three of us hadn’t done anything together: hadn’t gone on any gambling trips or had movie nights or even run the gambit of the other bars in town. I hadn’t seen Rich’s funny and awkward little sister, hadn’t asked after his family, nor him after mine. We hadn’t shared anything that friends share; and to that point, I hadn’t noticed these things, not with Addison filling my life. But I thought on them then.

For two hours, Rich stayed in the bar office with the door closed. And when he did come out, it wasn’t to sling drinks with us—something he usually did more for the fun of it than because we were ever truly slammed—but only to call Addison into the office. I heard while shaking a guest’s third gin martini in an hour, Rich’s raised voice. None of the guests at the bar seemed to hear it, or find interest if they did. I didn’t catch any words from it, but only a tone. It was an odd sound, all the normal pep and invitation gone. It was dead serious, but punitive rather than truly wrathful. It both frightened and confused me further. The thing causing Addison’s tears could have indeed been something work related, but if that was the case, what exactly was it? And why wouldn’t she talk to me about it?

I planned, as a man, to question Rich when he and Addison came out. Fuck him being my direct overseer and boss; he was being mean to the girl who let me take her respectfully to pound town. That’s serious shit. I meant to usher him back into the office and give him a piece of my mind, maybe even get in his face. When they came out, however, Addison’s face pale and drawn, Rich’s flushed red, he again rushed right past me with his coat, gloves, and scarf on and flew out the door as if he were the wind himself. The only guests to take any notice were those sitting on leather couches and chairs in the lobby proper; none at the bar were quite sober enough.

When I asked Addison what had happened, she said it was nothing, just something she’d missed and gotten chewed out for.

“Bullshit, it’s nothing!” I told her in tones hushed enough to be unheard. “Something’s going on here. Rich isn’t like that.” Addison only peered up at me, her eyes telling me everything and nothing at once, then pushed past me with a bottle in each hand and continued her work. In a bit of a huff—as if I had been the one to get yelled at—I took a break and went after Rich.

The cold buffeted me as I brisked past the valet, already worsening from when I’d parked, and the burgeoning darkness somehow surprised me, reminding me just how quickly the days now fell away. I jogged to the south side of the hotel and turned the corner. A parking lot lay to the southwest of The Gold Exchange, hidden behind and sharing its space with an office building. Staff and well-off guests parked or had their cars parked there. I squinted and saw the hint of a pant leg vanishing around the corner of the office building. I ran after him, rounded the corner, then sped up in seeing that it was indeed Rich, stepping at a good clip toward parked, snow-gathering cars. In a moment, I gained on him, unsure of what I was going to do, what I was going to say. I reached out and snatched at the shoulder of his suit coat. He stopped and turned cooly toward me.

“Hey,” I said, my heart beating hard. “Where are you going? What happened back there?”

“I have things to deal with, Devin,” Rich said. He tried to turn away from me. I grabbed his arm.

“What the fuck are you talking about? Why were you yelling at Addison?”

Rich pulled his arm sharply away, and I felt my frigid fingers snap together on nothing. “Don’t pry, Devin. It’s above your station. Go back and handle the bar.” He turned and began off.

Red anger rose in me, and I followed, yet again grabbing him and beginning to speak. Before I knew just what was happening, Rich had turned on his heel and shoved me with both his arms. I didn’t have time to plant my feet and went down half on my arm, half on my ass. My teeth clicked together, and when I looked up, Rich had already weaved himself into the maze of cars. Gone.

After a moment, I stood up and brushed snow off myself. Too much had already melted into my clothes and was re-freezing. I returned to the bar a defeated and newly chilled man. Addison wasn’t there. The guests were getting antsy, and I tended to them, overly conscious of the dark spots of dampness at my elbow and left shoulder. When I had it under control, I asked a regular where Addison had gone. He said the head of staff, Marion Grueber, had come down and asked for her. She’d been gone ten minutes.

She returned fifteen minutes later, her mood seemingly much improved, where mine had been and still was in the gutter. I pulled her into the office and tried to get her to tell me what had happened, what *was* happening, but she shut me out. She said everything was fine—that she had messed something up bad, but that they’d resolved it. She told me I shouldn’t have gone after Rich, that he was under a great lot of stress. I knew there was something more. I knew that she was lying to me, but short of medieval torture, she wouldn’t budge, so I worked alongside her, my mind spinning with something, *coiling* with something; and when our shift ended, she stayed behind, claiming she needed to finish something up.

That was just the beginning, just the fucking start of it; and I find myself now—recalling it in a way I never have—thinking that it’s a pretty Podunk beginning. God, do I wish for Podunk…. From now on, I’ll date everything—more for my own organization and sanity than anything else.  

*December 22****^(nd)****, 2019:*

 

I called Addison to take her out to lunch. I’d found a great spot downtown for gyros and other Mediterranean, and I wanted to try it. I didn’t ask her anything about the previous night over the phone—I didn’t want to overload her—but I could hear in her voice that she was doing better. We met, and she explained that a shipment of liquor had been first delayed (her fault, supposedly) then delivered to the wrong address (supposedly also her fault). Then, when it did come, and she saw what it contained, she had almost come entirely unglued. She’d ordered the wrong things, and a whole fucking lot of the wrong things. A month’s-pay worth of the wrong things. She’d found this out yesterday, explaining her distress and anxiety, and Rich had yelled at her when he himself saw the mistake. But he hadn’t been truly mean, and she was going to keep her job. It was all water under the bridge, all in the past—if not very distantly so. A whole lot of excuses got thrown my way, and Addison was so God damned pretty that part of me believed it all and let it lie. Another part, however, the part that had asked and asked and asked her what was wrong and received only deflection, the part that had seen her flick her eyes to the CCTV camera in downtrodden fear, the part that had seen and felt Rich’s cold anger, smelled a couple shovel-fulls of bullshit at least.

I accepted what she said, but inside I wondered, then wondered more.

As it was one of our days off, we spent the rest of it together. We went to a museum downtown after lunch, then walked around aimlessly talking. Then we had dinner. Then a movie. Then coffee at our favorite spot. Then we snuggled together in my apartment, out of the cold. For a time, I thought nothing of bartending, or the hotel, or any drama that might be going on within it. I can’t really describe Addison; no words can actually put you into my head when I was with her. The closest I think I can get is that she was the puzzle piece missing from my box, and that I couldn’t go on without her. She fulfilled me, made the world itself drop away as if it had never existed.

I wish only that she could do that for me again.

*December 23****^(rd)****, 2019:*

 

Our shift that day went off without a hitch. Everything outward had gone right back to normal. Addison was as cheerful and funny as ever; Rich, as well as calling the previous day to apologize profusely to me, returned to his standard prim buoyancy and cheer; and the ‘vibrations’ around the staff and the guests and the hotel itself seemed more Christmasy than they had before, even sacrosanct. The only disparate thing in that place was me.

I peered at every security camera with a sliver of an eye and marked down their locations in my mind. I wasn’t sure what exactly I was doing, nor *why* I was doing it, but it seemed right. There were six cameras in what I considered my immediate vicinity: the bar, lobby, and valet and guest entrance. Each blinking light reminded me of the scene two days before, and each pounded into me the wrongness of it, where my friends’ behavior attempted to sweep it away.

Around five-o'clock, an hour or so into our shift, Rich went out to smoke. I waved him a hearty, half-sarcastic goodbye while I washed out a shaker tin, and when he was gone, I peered to my left, toward Addison. She was grinning and talking with Tara Lorraine and her husband while stirring up a couple Manhattans for them. There were only two other guests at the bar, and a few stragglers otherwise in our sphere of responsibility. I had time, though perhaps not much, to do what I needed to do. The skin on the back of my neck prickling, I dried my hands and adjourned silently to the bar office, while the couple still held Addison’s attention.

In the office, I glanced at the blinking red eye of the camera, thought internally: *Fuck you*, then went first to my locker. I opened it—obscuring the camera’s view of me—rustled some things around, dug in my pockets, placed my phone and wallet into it, then took them out again and placed them back against my thighs. I shut the locker, peered at the shut office door, then took in a breath. It calmed me slightly.

I slipped behind the bar manager’s desk, knowing the camera saw me and not caring. There was a calendar and a sheet tacked beside it for people to put in notes, order requests, and the like. Even if someone did watch the camera, or perhaps the recordings, my going back there would not seem altogether strange. I hoped. What they could not see, what *would* get me into trouble, was me peering into Rich’s personal working notebook. Luckily, the desk itself was far enough back to be out of the camera’s eyeshot. Again, I hoped.

I’d seen him take it out and write in it from time to time, and I knew vaguely what he wrote in it. I was looking for proof of the story he and Addison seemed to have spun. Surely there would be notation: *Wrong order,* then the list of items to be returned and probably a list of the correct things to order.

The drawer where Rich kept it was not locked. I swallowed once more, then drew out the notebook. The front of it was black leather, embossed with the hotel’s insignia and the intended use: *Bar: Q3 & Q4*. I opened it. I felt insane, and I’m sure I looked insane, alternately glancing at the office door and down at the pages, flipping through them with a shaking hand. The book was made for maximum organization: each left-hand page had a weekly calendar with multiple squares for each day of the week; each right-hand page held a space of blank lines for notes and scribblings. Each book was meant for half a year, this the second of 2019, and nearly all the pages were filled. Shaking harder, I took the book in hand and flipped the pages with my thumb until I found unsullied space. There were two weeks left in the year: four organization pages blank, then five more for end-of-year notes.

I ran my finger across the dates, from the twentieth, Friday, to the twenty-third, today. There was nothing out of the ordinary yet, nothing to confirm or deny what I’d been told. But in there being nothing, didn’t that prove that it *had* indeed been a fake story? Rich’s other notes were extensive, his tiny neat script filling and nearly overtaking each little box. There was no way he wouldn’t have noted down an incorrect shipment of that size and apparent importance. I bent my head into one hand, massaging my temples.

“What the fuck am I doing?” I breathed. I was about to close the book while I still had plausible deniability, but something in me couldn’t leave it alone. It didn’t make sense, and that pissed me off. I flipped the page, and there I saw it. Under \*December 31\*\*\**^(st)* in a fancy script lay one word and a symbol among blank crème paper. The word was *Hinen’nahash*; and the symbol next to it seemingly a distant cousin of a cursive ‘Z’, all curls and loops. And though that was the first thing to come to mind, it was decidedly *not* any letter of the English language, not even a hastily scratched one. The symbol was much larger than any other writing and looked to have been carefully and expertly drawn, and by an intent hand. As well, there lay three dots above the swirls, like an ellipse. My finger drew near the symbol, and it seemed I could feel each little atom of the paper it stained.

“Hinen’nahash,” I said to myself, low and discrete, as if it were a secret thing. I stared at the symbol, and the word—or perhaps the name—floated back and forth in my mind. I heard the rapid thump of my heart in my ears, but felt it in my entire body, as if my blood pressure had sky-rocketed. My hands pulsed, and my head ached. All in my mind was a liminal image of coldness—dark blue-grey sky shot through with tendrils of black cloud, leafless trees shooting like spikes from an otherwise barren plain of unmarred snow—and the sound, *Hinen’nahash*, from a soft hissing voice outside of myself.

“Devin!” The voice, near a shout, yanked me out of that paralysis, and the world came rushing back in to fill a void that had been growing. Addison stood in the doorway, her eyes like fire. Now with my attention, she flicked her head back and looked out toward the bar. Her voice had been perhaps too loud. “Can you get out here and help me? We just got slammed.” My finger still sat on the page. It felt numb. I swallowed, only staring back at her, dreading the question of just what I was doing in here at the bar manager’s desk.

“Sorry…I’ll be right out.” Words felt odd. My mind and my tongue worked together well enough, like two parts of a machine, but the words themselves, the act of enunciating a flow of vibrations, cutting them off into syllables to be interpreted, seemed alien.

She was gone then, and for five seconds I only sat and stared at the closed door, my eyes unfocused. A computer monitor sat at the front of the desk. Had she seen the notebook, my finger on its page? Mechanically, I closed the book and placed it back in its drawer.

I went back to work.

I drove home.

I dreamed of a snake twining around and around the world, squeezing it for a crimson juice.

I am a big coffee/espresso drinker and will never turn down a coffee or coffee flavored treat. My first instinct was to make a cake, but I am only one person and can't justify making an entire cake every couple of weeks. I settled on these cookies, which are a little time intensive due to the browning of butter and freezing. Even though they don't look like the picture, I am pretty okay with them. Though I felt like I could've increased the espresso in this, I did not want them to be overpowering and my taste testers told me that they could taste it.

2. Comic books (super hero): big mix of marvel and dc comics and some independent lines. Like 80% is xmen, typical comic book violence, lots of adamantium claws in chests, ect

3.

# Best Seattle T Shirts of 2025: Find your perfect Tee!

Seattle, a city known for its coffee, music, and stunning scenery, also boasts a unique and vibrant t-shirt culture. Finding the perfect Seattle t-shirt is more than just buying a piece of clothing; it's about representing your love for the Emerald City and its distinct character. From iconic landmarks to local breweries and quirky slogans, there's a Seattle tee for everyone. This review dives into the best Seattle t-shirts of 2025, helping you find the perfect one to express your seattle pride. We'll explore quality,design,comfort,and overall value to guide your purchase.

## Key Features Analysis

Seattle t-shirts come in a wide range of styles, materials, and designs. The best options combine comfort, durability, and a unique Seattle-centric aesthetic.

**Material Quality:** A top consideration when purchasing a t-shirt is the material. High-quality Seattle t-shirts typically use 100% combed ringspun cotton or a cotton-poly blend. Combed ringspun cotton is exceptionally soft and durable, minimizing shrinkage and offering a smooth print surface. Cotton-poly blends, such as 60% cotton and 40% polyester, provide added wrinkle resistance and moisture-wicking properties, making them suitable for active wear. Lower-quality tees may use cheaper cotton that feels rougher and wears out more quickly, so always check the label.

**Printing Technique:** The printing method significantly impacts the longevity and visual appeal of a Seattle t-shirt. Screen printing is a common choice for bold, vibrant designs, especially for larger quantities. direct-to-garment (DTG) printing allows for more intricate designs and photographic prints, but may not be as durable as screen printing. Heat transfer vinyl (HTV) is a more budget-amiable option, often used for personalized tees, but the design can crack or peel over time. Look for tees with high-quality screen printing or DTG printing for the best results.**Design Authenticity and Uniqueness:** A grate Seattle t-shirt captures the spirit of the city with original and well-executed designs. This can include iconic landmarks like the Space Needle, Mount Rainier, or the Pike Place Market, or celebrate local themes such as coffee culture, music, or the city's unique weather. Unique and artistic renditions stand out, avoiding overly generic or mass-produced imagery. Look for shirts designed by local artists or featuring original artwork to support the creative community and ensure you're getting a truly distinctive piece.

**Fit and Sizing Options:** A cozy fit is essential for any t-shirt. high-quality Seattle t-shirts offer a variety of sizes and fits, including classic crew neck, V-neck, and fitted styles. Unisex sizes are common and generally run true to size, but it's always an excellent idea to check the size chart before ordering. Some brands offer tailored fits for men and women, providing a more flattering silhouette. Consider your personal preferences and body type when selecting the right size and fit.

Key features of the best Seattle t-shirts include:

 High-quality materials such as combed ringspun cotton or cotton-poly blends.
 Durable printing techniques like screen printing or direct-to-garment (DTG).
* Original and authentic Seattle-themed designs.* A wide range of sizes and fit options.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality Seattle t-shirt offers numerous benefits, from comfort and durability to style and self-expression. The right tee can become a wardrobe staple and a lasting reminder of your love for the city.**Maximum Comfort:** A well-made Seattle t-shirt made from soft, breathable materials like combed ringspun cotton provides all-day comfort. The smooth texture feels pleasant against the skin, and the fabric allows for good airflow, preventing overheating. This is particularly importent in Seattle's variable climate, where layering is often necessary.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about Seattle t-shirts to help you make an informed purchase:

**What are the best materials for Seattle t-shirts?**
The best materials for Seattle t-shirts are typically 100% combed ringspun cotton or a cotton-poly blend. Combed ringspun cotton is soft, durable, and breathable, while cotton-poly blends offer added wrinkle resistance and moisture-wicking properties. Avoid cheaper cotton options that may feel rougher and wear out more quickly.

**How do I care for my Seattle t-shirt to ensure its longevity?**
To ensure the longevity of your Seattle t-shirt, wash it inside out in cold water and tumble dry on low heat or hang to dry. Avoid using bleach or harsh detergents,as these can damage the fabric and printing. If ironing is necessary, iron inside out on a low setting. Proper care will help prevent fading,shrinking,and cracking of the design.

**Where can I find unique Seattle t-shirt designs?**
You can find unique Seattle t-shirt designs at local boutiques, craft fairs, and online marketplaces like Etsy. Many independent designers and small businesses offer original Seattle tees that you won't find in mainstream stores. Look for shops that feature artwork by local artists or focus on Seattle-specific themes.## Competitor Comparison

That surely means they met at one centralised location / lobby before being guided to their pods. Then everyone got a chance to perform, vote and interact, then also perform as a band. That complexity would require multiple days to film, and they would need bathroom breaks, meal breaks etc.  **(edit - I just googled this and apparently the pods sequence was a 6 day shoot)**. So for 6 days these guys would have been in the same hotel, hanging out after the shoot, sharing bathroom / meals / coffee breaks etc. Unless you think production would make them wear blindfolds when not on camera and put them up in 50 different hotels across town :)

The idea that they'd never seen each other before performing together is really cute, but if you think about it, it's extremely unlikely. Not seeing each other is a big part of Love is Blind, and we are shown that males and females are clearly in separate dorms so we trust that process. But BTB expects us to believe that 50 individuals are kept in isolation during that first part of the process, without showing any evidence of the \*enormous\* effort and logistics that would require.

Perhaps I'm overly cynical, but I just don't buy it. I do love the show though!",5,1753658038.0,BuildingTheBandSeries,6,1.0,False
1mb0ioe,https://i.redd.it/f7qaxigl1iff1.jpeg,AI helped me reconstruct my memory of a hidden Melbourne café — can you help me find it?,"Hi, Melbourne friends! I was a backpacker holiday student from 2015 to 2020.

I need your help to find a very special place. Before the pandemic (March to July 2017), I went to a very special cafe near the City Loop (or maybe just outside the City Loop) that made a lasting impression on me and I always wanted to find it. I couldn't remember all the details at first, so I asked artificial intelligence to help me sort it out. Here is what I sorted out from memory:

⸻

Appearance:
• The building is small and cubic, not high-rise.
• The black glass curtain wall is simple and clear, with no decorative columns, no awnings, and no exaggerated signs.
• The main entrance is located in the southwest corner and is low-key and introverted.
• There is a small coffee takeaway window to the left of the main entrance - this feature is very eye-catching.
• The back door leads to a quiet alley with a few steps and possibly a ramp with stainless steel handrails.

⸻

Indoors:
• The lobby and the cafe are integrated - the coffee bar is part of the building design, not a separate store.
• The bar counter is made of solid wood veneer, and the countertop is creamy white or ivory marble.
• The interior walls and bathroom doors are decorated with wood panels, adding a touch of classic style.
• Brass door handles and accessories - slightly worn and patinated, with a warm luster due to years of polishing
• The floor is smooth due to repeated waxing - it may be black and white tiles, or ivory white marble with a slightly yellowish tint under warm light.
• The lighting is soft and warm (golden), creating an almost 90s nostalgic atmosphere.
• The space is not large - only about 4 to 5 pings (about 13-16 square meters). Narrow and elegant. It is a bit conflicting with the glass curtain style outside.

⸻

Atmosphere:
• It is quiet and private here, with no trams passing by, like a small temple in the heart of the central business district.
• I remember everyone there was wearing suits, so this was probably the lobby of a boutique office building or small restaurant.

• No outdoor seating - very low-key, almost private.

⸻

Possible locations:

• Near the City Loop, possibly near La Trobe Street, Queen Victoria Street, Carlton Street or State Library Victoria.

• Possibly near RMIT or Melbourne University.

⸻

Unfortunately, I didn't take any photos that day - I really regret it now. This place holds important memories for me and I would love to find it again.

Let me know if this reminds you of anything. A photo of the lobby and back lane would mean a lot to me if you happen to pass by and see a scene like this.

Thank you so much for reading - and thank you, Melbourne!",0,1753658004.0,melbourne,26,0.17,False
1mb0i4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1mb0i4j/lost_13_pounds/,Lost 13 POUNDS,"I lost 13 pounds in 2 weeks and 4 days. 
 
When I started Keto I kinda discovered it by accident , but the idea of my body burning my fat as a fuel source had me thinking. 

I decided to give it a REAL shot and it’s been hard I won’t lie , I was a pretty avid beer drinker almost every weekend I had to of taken down about 8 beers minimum (Coors Banquet) not very good for you. Since then I’ve been eating much cleaner as well. I’ve been using Tuna creations packets to make tuna salads with avocado mayo , olive oils , guaq, lime & random cheeses as well. They’re not bad at all & I make sure to eat them with celery for that crunch feeling that’s so satisfying and delicious . When I got out i mainly get salads making sure that there’s no hidden carbs in the salad. I also sometimes get a rotisserie chicken from Publix or Walmart and eat that as my protein for about 3 days. Pairing it with cheese and random condiments like peanuts .. and celery ! God I love celery. I don’t exactly count my macros , but I do make sure I eat under 20gs of carbs a day and just get protein and a good amount of fats in. 

I started at 187.5lbs about 3 weeks ago , my first go didn’t go to well because I ate a crap ton of watermelon and completely ruined my ketosis. I now am much more careful and decisive with what I consume. 

Fast forward 2 weeks! 

Today I weighed my self at the gym with a digital scale and I was 175lbs!!! I mean I couldn’t even believe it my self. It was actually funny because yesterday I weighed my self at Publix and I thought the scale was off  because just last week I was about 10 pounds heavier! (I’ll add the video if I can) I’m hitting the gym hard trying to maintain my muscle while burning off this fat! Mainly hitting heavy workouts to really tell my muscle to stay alive and that I need it lol. I also run about 2 miles everyday minimum some days more depends how I feel . Just trying to stay active and condition for soccer. 

I’ve been waking up better every morning feeling great not tired at all , not lazy , occasionally I go for the second snooze alarm but rarely now. I have been more motivated to get good sleep as well (no more late night game sheses with the boys) .. but that’s okay. I have more energy durning the day I don’t need coffee at all anymore which used to be a morning routine. I am much more social I have less social anxiety , I guess I just feel happier with my self so it makes me want to share that energy?

Now on other hand , I truly haven’t felt anything bad towards the diet except the fact that I can’t eat enjoy “the good foods” like the pizza when hanging with friends or the good menu items.. but I’m quickly getting over that. Now the alcohol ? I rarely drink now just due to the fact that I don’t really need to? Yesterday I went out and I totally did not want to be sober all night so I did have a double tequila coke and that’s all for the whole night .. I pat my self in the back for that 🙂‍↕️(before I would drink like a fish) glad to be changing my life it’s very exiting. 
I have been getting more musky which I never do and that’s the first thing that believe it or not got me super excited since that’s a ketosis symptom.  

I will add some photos from sort of where I was at when I started vs now. 

Everyone please stay motivated this diet works and I’m excited to continue doing it. 

Currently I weight 175lbs

Briefly, interests include a good walk, talk, sunshine, clouds (on partly cloudy day), animals/nature, flowers, birds, a cup of coffee: the simple little things these days. For topics, generally psychology and politics (perhaps you can teach me more?)

It would be really nice to have a loyal, committed friend deeper than a brother or cousin, but not romantic or sexual. For personal reasons it’s a boundary-crosser, but it’d still be nice to find someone committed, loyal, and even willing to reserve a large part of their heart for the other person

I’ve been drinking pour-over coffee daily for a while now, but I’m ready to upgrade to an espresso setup for more variety (especially milk-based drinks like lattes and flat wh
ites).

I’m currently deciding between two options and could really use some advice:


☕️ Option 1: Used Breville Barista Touch

1 year old, used every 2–3 days

$900 SGD

Built-in grinder, touchscreen interface, auto milk frothing

Well maintained (from what I can tell), but no remaining warranty


☕️ Option 2: New HiBREW H10A + HiBREW G5 Grinder

Brand new setup — both items together at $360 SGD

More manual control, entry-level build quality

---

I’m torn between:

Paying more for long-term convenience, consistency, and better build (Breville), or

Spending less for a budget-friendly starter kit to explore espresso without a big upfront cost.


I do drink coffee every day and would likely use the machine 4–6 times a week. I can afford the Barista Touch, but I’m just unsure if it’s overkill or the smarter long-term investment.

Would love to hear your thoughts — especially if you’ve used either of these setups, or made a similar decision yourself.

Thanks in advance!

Most folks have never had any teas that weren't bagged before, so I've gotten a lot of really positive reactions. One of my friends has been so taken by puerh that he's switched from coffee, and has asked me to put in a tea order for him. I decided to go in on it, because I can't resist the opportunity to buy some more tea and I'd like to expand my horizons a bit.

My friend so far is really into shou, as am I. But I just tried a purple tea the other day and would like to explore that some more, as well as perhaps a sheng or two or other options that are unfamiliar to me. I did have the good fortune of receiving a Liquid Proust beginner's package last year, so I've tried a fair number of shengs, but I don't think I've really found any that wowed me yet. 

Here's what I have picked so far; I think it's a good balance of different things for me, as well as some solid daily drinker shou picks for him. What do you think?
