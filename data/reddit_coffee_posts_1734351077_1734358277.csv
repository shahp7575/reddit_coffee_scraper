The query took several minutes of processing. This is what it returned. The diet is similar to Bryan Johnsons, but I think its even better. It adds seafood and whole grains for a more balanced diet.

My mom's coworker, who is a friend of hers and is FTM, has a three-year-old daughter and is 35 weeks pregnant with a son.  
My children are 18.5, 16, 12, and 7, and I am 31 weeks pregnant with TWINS. 6th pregnancy, one was a loss at 11w. I also owned a home daycare for infants to 5/6-year-olds for 13 years, worked 6-7 days a week, 5am-7pm. I consider myself vastly experienced with children. 

We go out to eat with her roughly once a month after my ultrasound; my mom, she, and I. Every time I see her, she gives me advice on raising my babies or what i should eat—every single friggin' time. 
 She comments on when they should be weaned (I nurse until they self-wean), how/where they should sleep, what my 18yo should be doing (school and work right now, thinks she's should be paying bills and stuff...don't see how it's any of her business), judges what I eat, and criticizes my one cup of coffee as shes chugging cup after cup of Pepsi. 

I complained about the amount of pain I'm in, (spd and lot of pain when I move) and she told me ""it only gets worse, try being 35 weeks"". Bitch, try being pregnant with twins with spd! I'm bigger than my longest lasting pregnancy, 38w. 
I'm sick of it. I say things like, ""Not my first rodeo,"" or ill just simle and not say anything... but honestly, it makes me angry and I want to go off on her. Obviously I can't really say what I want to say because my mom does work with her and is friends with her, but it's driving me insane to the point I just want to skip the once a month I get to get out. I only leave for my dr appointments and ultrasounds due to being in so much pain, and want to enjoy the time with my mom bc we don't have a great relationship and I'm trying desperately to have one with her. I've asked her not to invite her, but she always does because she feels sorry for her since she never gets out, either. 

Pls, if you're a ftm or stm, don't give advice out to moms with more experience than you UNLESS they ask. It's rude and honestly, silly. Pregnancy rage has hit me really hard this pregnancy and she's making it worse. I hate seeing her face. 

Rant over.

1hfjr2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/OOALMarketing/comments/1hfjr2b/sponsored_discover_michael_jacksons_incredible/,Sponsored *Discover Michael Jackson’s Incredible Secrets to Business! Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1734357736.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

Thinking about diving into SMS marketing? Here are the **3️⃣ pillars** you absolutely need to build a successful strategy:

1. **Permission is Power 💪**
   * **Get the Green Light:** Always ensure you have explicit consent before texting. No one likes unsolicited messages—unless it’s pizza delivery, right? 🍕
2. **Craft Compelling Content 📝**
   * **Keep it Snappy:** SMS has a 160-character limit, so make every word count! Use humor, urgency, or exclusive offers to grab attention. Think of it as texting your best friend… but for business. 😉
3. **Timing is Everything ⏰**
   * **Hit the Right Moment:** Send messages when your audience is most likely to engage. Morning coffee? Lunchtime deals? Avoid those 3 AM texts unless you’re selling night owls some owl-themed merch. 🦉

1hfjq6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1hfjq6w/finding_your_business_idea_in_everyday_life/,Finding Your Business Idea in Everyday Life,"Take a moment and look around you. Seriously, I want you to consider what’s right in front of you—your neighborhood, your coffee shop, the park where you take your dog on those epic sniffing adventures. I’ll be honest; I used to view my surroundings through a rather myopic lens. I was a bit like a kid with blinders on, focused only on my own little bubble. Then came the wake-up call, like someone flicked a switch in my brain (surprisingly, it wasn’t caffeine).

One day, while waiting for my usual dose of morning joe, I spotted an elderly man struggling to carry his groceries. By the looks of it, he had a mountain of stress dating back to, well, probably the start of the grocery store. So, I did what any self-respecting citizen would do… I rushed over to help. I mean, I could have just pretended to check my phone and completely ignored him, but something inside nudged me on.

During our trek down the street, he shared stories that I’d never have imagined coming from the mouth of a stranger. He recounted tales of his youth, laughter bubbling over every now and then like soda that’s been shaken one too many times. Through that one small act, I not only met a practical need, but I also opened a door to an unexpected friendship and learned more about community than any self-help book could ever teach me.

Our God often nudges us to observe unmet needs in subtle and not-so-subtle ways—maybe it’s through a missed item on a shopping list, a lonely neighbor, or even a coworker drowning in deadlines. When we take a second to pause and really see, we might just find a calling in those spaces. 

So, grab those blinders, toss them aside, and start to take an inventory of opportunities around you. You never know how a simple act of kindness can transform not just someone else's day, but also your own journey of faith. The world is full of needs waiting to be met, like a buffet where every dish offers a new flavor of connection. Be open. Be generous. You might just find that in serving others, your own heart expands, and you experience a little slice of heaven right here on earth.",1,1734357679.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

For instance, this weekend I was out with friends, at one point we were sat in a coffee shop and I noticed this woman who caught my attention. I looked at her a couple of times as you do, and I caught her *maybe* looking back at me. The problem is I couldn’t actually tell if she was looking at me, as it was dimly lit inside the coffee shop and I couldn’t actually make out where she was looking

My problem is, with the fact that she was good looking, I couldn’t actually tell if she was looking back at me, and the fact that she didn’t explicitly say / show she was interested in me, I didn’t approach her. I don’t have an issue getting rejected I think, it’s more just a lack of confidence in that they are interested in me enough for me to approach them, how can I change this?",2,1734357615.0,AskMen,6,1.0,False

**Mon- 12/9/24 (Steps - 18,284)** 

* 9:45 am - Started drive from Palm Beach Gardens (One pit stop).
* 12:21 pm - Arrived at Art of Animation (AoA). This was my first time staying there. Room was not ready (expected). Hopped on Skyliner to Hollywood Studios (HS) tagged in for AP reservation.
* 1:00 pm - Star Tours (walk-on). Saw some scenes that were new to us. Do you always go backwards out of the departure bay or is that new?
* 1:31 pm - In line for bus to Animal Kingdom Lodge (AKL), the previous bus had just left.
* 2:12 pm - Arrived at AKL to look at Holiday Decorations and say hi to the animals out back. 
* 2:45 pm - On bus to Animal Kingdom (AK).
* Picked up AP freebie at Chester and Hester’s (Mufasa postcard…good thing there was no line because this was kind of lame). My brother got us on the walk-up list for Nomad Lounge and we got called on our way there. We were seated outside and luckily got a shady spot, as it gets very sunny in the afternoon. The weather was lovely though. We saw a Character Barge going by. Satay Chicken and Cuban Sliders were good. We looked for the French Press coffee, but it appears to no longer be available which is unfortunate. We left Nomad at 4:01 pm.
* 4:14 pm - Kilimanjaro Safari, basically a walk-on. There are not as many animals this time of day, but the lighting is nice and the wait is short.
* 5:05 pm - Purposely got in line for Flight of Passage (FoP) for a posted 90 minute wait in order to see Pandora at night for the first time.
* 6:24 pm - In FoP pre-show bay. I love this ride, it is so relaxing to me. We were on the side in the middle. The 3D effects were kind of blurry. I noticed this the last few times I rode. It gets better if you look to the middle of your field of view.
* Pandora at night was magical and beautiful and I took lots of pictures. On our way out I went to get a picture of the Tree of Life at night and was surprised when the lights dimmed and the Tree of Life Awakenings Holiday Edition show started. I had never seen it before. My brother didn't even know it was a thing, lol.
* 7:10 pm - On bus to AoA. Picked up quick service to take to our room in the Little Mermaid building #8. It was the furthest from everything, but with a great view of the Skyliner and Hourglass Lake.
* 8-something pm - There were some issues with our room and we got magically upgraded to a Nemo suite in building #5 with the same view and short walk to the Skyliner station and Quick Service area. I took the separate bedroom/bathroom and my brother slept on the foldout couch with his own bathroom. This was an unexpected treat and a cast compliment was given.

**Tue- 12/10/24 (Steps - 21,079)**

* 7:00 am - Secured Virtual Queue (VQ) for Cosmic Rewind (CR) with callback estimated for 12:15 pm.
* 9:10 am - Arrived at EPCOT via Skyliner (forgot to clock start time). Went immediately to Remy's and used the Single Rider lane. I think the posted Standby wait was over 40 minutes. Single Rider was a walk on and my brother and I got in the same car but different rows. 100% the best way to ride this ride for a party of two adults who don't care about sitting next to each other.
* 9:27 am - In line for Les Halles...gotta love the Croissant Sale Sandwich and some of the strongest coffee in EPCOT! If the line is inside the building, you probably won't wait too long. It moves quickly. 
* 10:25 am -In line for Frozen with a posted wait of 45 minutes; actual wait was about 40 minutes. We were just killing time for the CR VQ anyway.
* Went to Connections for another AP freebie and to browse. My brother missed his phone notification for CR callback at 11:20 am. 
* 11:43 am - Scanned into CR and were in pre-pre-show by 11:54 am. Song = September (not new), we both still need I Ran and One Way or Another.
* Headed to the Monorail for Magic Kingdom (MK) via Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC) and arrived at MK by 12:29 pm. This was a Party Night, so crowds were light considering it was the holidays.
* 1:07 pm - In line for Jingle Cruise with posted wait of 30 minutes which ended up being 40. The overlay was cute. My favorite part was a sign with call back to the old Trader Sam's at the end.
* Just before the parade ended, we got lunch at Pecos Bill's. I had the Flatbread with chicken and it was good. There was no line when we ordered, but it was crowded when we left.
* 2:32 pm - In line for Big Thunder Mountain Railroad with a posted and actual wait of 20 minutes. Got the middle row of the last car. We had a Gen Zer behind us Wilhelm screaming the whole time and he was hilarious. The back is the best!
* 3:15 pm - In line for Haunted Mansion with a posted wait of 25 minutes that went up to 30 minutes at 3:17 pm. We were in the Dead Center of the Room by 3:50 pm. This is my favorite ride and I rarely skip it.
* 4:14 pm - In line for Enchanted Tiki room and seated 5 minutes later. I had not seen this since it switched back to the OG version. A little dated, but hits all the nostalgia feels and gets you off your feet.
* 4:30 pm - In line for Pirates of the Caribbean with a posted wait of 15 minutes. Seemed accurate, I forgot to look.
* 5:11 pm - Monorail to TTC.
* 5:27 pm - Monorail back to EPCOT.
* 5:51 pm - In line to see Glimmering Greenhouses Living with the Land for the first time. Posted wait of 35 minutes, actual wait was only 19 minutes. That ride is an efficient people eater and the line moves steadily. I really enjoyed the overlay, so many pretty lights. This is best seen at night. 
* 6:28 pm - Soarin’ with a posted wait of 15 minutes, was watching Flight Attendant Patrick Warburton by 6:40 pm.
* The rest of the evening we wandered around World Showcase for Festival of the Holidays food. Pork Schnitzel in Germany, and Smoked Salmon Potato Latke and Black and White Cookie at L'Chaim were all good (as recommended by DFB). Both lines moved quickly. It was crowded due to the Candlelight Processional, but we were still able to find tables and seating, so not too bad.
* 8:25 pm- In line for Skyliner, departed at 8:40 pm, at 8:58 pm we were at the Caribbean Beach transfer station, at 9:04 pm we were on the Skyliner to AoA with a 9:07 pm arrival. This was the first time I took the Skyliner at night and it was really cool to see the lights of EPCOT and HS.
* On our way back to the room we stopped by the pool bar. My brother asked the bartender if he could order a drink that wasn't on the menu and she replied, ""Sure, I can be a real bartender!""  Lol! I asked for Ginger Beer and Pineapple Juice and it was sooo good (she even put a pineapple slice in it)!
* 9:23 pm - back in room.

**Wed - 12/11/24 (Steps - 24,929)**

* 7:00 am - Secured VQ for CR,  group 73 with an estimated callback at 1:45 pm.
* 10:00 am - 10:13 am - On Skyliner to the Riviera for Breakfast at Primo Piatto so I could have Lemon Blueberry pancakes for the first time.  It was good and I would order it again. Another score for DFB.
* 10:55 am - Skyliner for EPCOT with 11:05 am arrival. My brother got flagged for security despite holding out his umbrella. He was in the park by 11:13 am. 
* 11:20 am - In line for a Coffee Mocha Cookie from Melee Kalikamaka. I waited for about 5 minutes and took it over to Communicore to eat while looking at the Ginger Bread Spaceship Earth. It was really good and I highly recommend it. Again, a DFB pick!
* We killed time waiting for the CR VQ callback by hanging out in the Connections breezeway. We people watched and tried the Viva Raspberry from Moldova (which sounds like a Hallmark Movie country). I thought it tasted like Raspberry NyQuil Soda. My personal favorite is the Sprite Cucumber from Russia.
* 12:54 pm - Callback for CR 
* 1:00 pm - Walked into pre-show room with no waiting in line to get there. The line inside the loading area also moved quickly and was one of the fastest I'd ever experienced. We got the second row in the first car which is one of my favorite spots because my eyes tear up in the first row due to the wind. Song = Disco Inferno (Not New).
* We waited out a rainy cold front in Connections and walked to France for the Smoked Salmon Sandwich on Brioche which was a good light lunch and was easy to eat on the go. 
* The Skyliner was closed due to the weather, but since it began to clear up and we were nearby, we decided to head that way anyway. We spoke with a Cast Member outside the Skyliner line, but they were unsure when it would reopen. Of note, he said there were buses waiting behind the Skyliner, so we didn't have to walk all the way back to the front of EPCOT. We then spoke with a boat captain, who explained that the storm needed to be at least 3 miles away before the Skyliner could resume operation. He mentioned that they had just received clearance to run the boats, so the Skyliner would likely be back up soon, and it was. Though the Skyliner can be unpredictable, the boat captain's advice helped us decide to wait it out. Whew!
* 2:15 pm We heard cheers from the Skyliner station and knew it was running (I forgot to check how long we waited to board), we were at the Riviera station by 2:25 pm, at Caribbean/HS by 2:31 pm, and on the way to AoA by 2:33 pm with a 2:37 pm arrival. Once it is running, the line moves quickly.
* 2:40 pm - Took it easy at AoA to rest up for Jollywood Nights. 
* 5:00 pm - Left AoA for Jollywood Nights - As APs we could enter HS early. 
* 5:25 pm - My brother added us to the walk up list for Oga's Cantina with a stated 1 hour wait and then we got in line for Rise of the Resistance (RoR) and were in the transport ship by 5:37 pm.
* 5:59 pm - Obtained Jollywood wristbands with no wait.
* 6:10 pm - Oga's was ready for us. I had the Carbon Freeze and my brother had something that was completely black and we shared the Umbaran Cheese Roll (pretzel bread with spicy cheese), good snack.
* 6:44 pm - Smuggler's Run was a walk-on and we had our own ship as pilots. We did another run so we could take turns on the left and right sides. It was so much fun! 
* 7:30 pm - Nightmare Before Christmas Sing-Along. This was a one and done for us. Don't go to the first show because it was very crowded and we ended up in the front to the side and couldn't see well. I love NBC, but this was kinda meh for me.
* I stopped keeping track of time because we were doing things with no wait. We headed over to Tower of Terror to ride (only four riders - all in the front row) and then went to the bar to get a Sparkling Pomegranate-Apple Cider for me and some flavored champagne for my brother. We drank and enjoyed the Twilight Soiree at the Tip Top Club. This was my favorite performance. I loved the Old Hollywood band/singer and liked that the dancers engaged the kids as well. So wholesome!
* There were also two photo-ops in this area. All of the photos from the night were complimentary to download, including ride photos/videos! This was one of my favorite things about the party and has real added value. 
* Rock N Roller Coaster was a walk-on. We walked by the pre-show. The coaster seemed a lot more jerky than I remembered. We sat toward the back, so maybe that was it.
* We went to Fairfax Fare and both got a Holiday Turkey Popover and split a PB&J Doughnut. These were both good. The doughnut had chocolate and potato chips and I really liked that salty/sweet combo. 
* We watched a little bit of Glisten (ice skating show), but it was difficult to see their feet so we went on Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railroad. This had a short wait, but no big deal. 
* 10:00 pm Jingle Bell, Jingle Bam - light show and fireworks. This was good!
* Headed to Slinky Dog which had the longest wait of any ride (20-30 minutes maybe), but the line was moving, I hadn't ridden it in a long time, and it is really fun at night. Had another Gen Zer screaming behind us the whole time - again in a funny way. 
* Went back to Batuu and found a photo-op with light sabers! They were red and green but unfortunately   the red one stopped working before it was our turn so we took turns with green. Still cool.
* Next was a photo op with The Mandalorian and Grogu. This had a long line, but we had done pretty much everything we wanted to do and we are both Star Wars fans so we waited. This is the way.
* Rode RoR again. Entry was via the Lightening Lane which was nice because it is a shorter walk. The CMs were on point with the role play and they only loaded the front of the cars because it was so dead. Speaking of dead - we had B mode both times, lol. 
* We went over to Market to get Caramel-Apple Cider, which I thought would be hot, but was cold and it was cold that night. It was still tasty though.
* We left around midnight and took the bus back to AoA since the Skyliner was closed for the night.

**Thur - 12/12/24 (Steps- 3,793)**

* 10:00 am breakfast at Landscape of Flavors. I had Avocado Totchos and they were tasty and kept me full for the drive home.  
* 10:45 am left AoA
* 2:35 pm - Arrived home in Fort Lauderdale.

**Observations**

* Cast Members were great and we had some excellent interactions, one compliment worthy, and no complaints.
* Overall the other attendees were polite, interactions were good when they happened, and children were behaving appropriately or as expected for being overstimulated or tired. 
* There were call outs and people heading to the doors on CR both times. 
* Going to parks on party days, especially during the week, is a good idea. 
* I feel like I saw a lot more ECVs/Scooters than usual. You can definitely tell the experienced drivers from the newbies. If you or a loved one is renting one for the first time, try to get some experience before you are in the parks. 
* Be forgiving, Disney Brain is real and even experienced park goers have their moments. Always assume Disney Brain and have patience unless someone is being overtly rude.
* Ride loading - this trip Frozen, MMRR, and PoTC all seemed to be poorly controlling how many people were in a row or cramming too many people in the car/boat. I seem to recall having just your party in a row on most rides in the past. 
* Hot take on hot food - Almost everything I ate was lukewarm at best with the exception of what we had at Les Halles and Oga's. I know they don't want anyone to burn their tongue, but I'd be willing to sign a waiver for some hot food!

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I started this Christian Bale diet 4 days ago and decided to start posting about it daily. I wasn't so sure if it was a sustainable diet but as far as I see it's quite possible to do, in fact; it's more enjoyable for me because it's harder and I like the challenge because my willpower works better in do or d\*e situations. I get that some people might prefer more comfortable diets but trust me i know what i want so please do not advise me to stop. I know the risks and doing it at my own cost. What I've been eating when I was not dieting probably was way worse. 

So,

**-Christian Bale's Machinist diet contains \*1 can of Tuna Fish, 1 green Apple a day, and 1 cup black coffee-**

  
**MODIFICATIONS**: I eat my Tuna Fish with lettuce turning into a salad and I put cinnamon to my apple. I also I'm more of a Tea person so i drink tea mostly instead of coffee. Because first, I'm not a psychopath, and second, It would be boring as hel

  
**DAY 1** \- Tuna Salad, Green Apple with cinnamon. 2 Cups of black coffee **Less than 200kcal**.

**DAY 2** \- Tuna Salad that contains lettuce and 4 to 5 green olives. Green Apple with Cin **Less than 200kcal**

**DAY 3 -** It was getting boring, So I added a table spoon of Turkish Yoghurt (Not sweet Yoghurt) to my Salad and get rid of the olives. I'm making these adjustments because its hella boring to eat the same meal everyday but regardless I'm keeping the calorie i take less than 200 calories. Ate my apple, no tea. Day end.

**DAY 4** \- Tuna salad with yoghurt and apple with cinnamon, 2 cups of tea. Day end.

  
**Slight side effects**: It got harder to sleep and I sleep longer (duh) my smoking increased like %20 percent. Other than that I haven't eaten today because I don't feel like eating Tuna fish Again but I don't feel hungry at all. 

**Tuna Fish covers the 69% of your daily nutritive value and apple gives you the sugar you need.** I don't think I was taking %69 of my daily nutritive value before I started this diet anyways.

  
**PROGRESS:** 75.9kg to 71.6 in like a week. I'm losing weight faster because my body also getting rid of the edema but mathematically I will average on losing 2kg per week. Because what I eat is absolute. 2200 calorie deficency per day. Feeling great. Because the challenge is great. Seeing results fast is great. Stashing the food my mom buys to the house is great. I feel determined, motivated, proud and overall joyfull. Even though my body is less energetic It's been a long time since I felt this good.

1hfjlqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1hfjlqc/sick_quit/,Sick quit,"Going into Christmas and the new year, I really wanted to quit and stop wasting so much money on this crap.  But I was afraid of becoming a jerk around my wife and kids during the holidays, so was probably going to push quitting to the new year which means I basically had no concrete plans to quit and would be telling myself the same story in March, May, October …

However, I got some sort of food poisoning or stomach bug on Thursday morning that knocked me out of commission all that day and into Friday. Had a subsequent bout of nausea on Saturday. Haven’t wanted much food or coffee until this morning (Monday), and due to the sickness also haven’t seriously wanted a pouch since all this started. 

I’m about 110 hours into quitting, so I’m past the worst of it and thanks to the sickness I haven’t even really noticed. As I return to normal (and go back to work) I am anticipating some heavy cravings to show up, but I’m taking this illness as a major gift and not going to throw it away. 

Wanted to share in case anyone is dreading the quit. If you’re not strong enough to just do it, then take advantage of the next time you’re sick. 

At least for me some of this was less about the chemical and more about a rote habit … one out, next one in, just because “that’s what I do.” The cycle felt unbreakable, but having it broken by an external force showed me just how weak of a pattern it really is.

1hfjlev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1hfjlev/the_vanishing_neighbor/,The Vanishing Neighbor,"
I live in a small apartment complex where everyone knows each other on some level. My neighbor, Sarah, has always been friendly—mid-40s, long dark hair, and an unmissable habit of wearing this bright yellow scarf no matter the weather. We’ve chatted a few times in the hallway, exchanged pleasantries, and even shared a cup of coffee once when her power went out.

A few weeks ago, I saw her leaving her apartment as I was coming back from work. We exchanged the usual small talk, and she mentioned she was heading to the grocery store. Nothing strange about that—until later that evening.

Around 9 p.m., I heard someone crying in the hallway. When I stepped out, Sarah’s door was wide open, but the lights inside were off. I knocked lightly and called her name. No answer. I peeked in, feeling uneasy. The apartment looked completely empty—no furniture, no pictures, nothing. It was like no one had lived there for years.

I went back inside, trying to rationalize what I saw. Maybe she moved out suddenly, though it seemed impossible to clear out an apartment in just a few hours. The next morning, I asked the landlord if Sarah had moved. He gave me a blank look and said, “Sarah? There’s no one by that name here. That unit’s been vacant for months.”

At this point, I was convinced I was losing it. I pulled up our building’s group chat to check for any messages from Sarah, but she wasn’t in the chat history. It was like she had never existed.

Here’s the kicker: two days later, I found her yellow scarf draped over the railing outside her door. I grabbed it, thinking I’d keep it as proof of her existence. But the next morning, the scarf was gone too.

I still can’t explain what happened. I know she was real. I talked to her. I saw her. But it’s like she was wiped from reality—except for that brief moment when her scarf reappeared, as if to say goodbye.

I did some web searches using Chrome, Bing, and Yahoo but didn't find anything, so I'm hoping that somebody here might know.  There were some search results that indicated it may have been from MASH episode, but the dialogue didn't match and it was Loretta Swit saying it instead of a male voice.

Dizziness, facial tightness, horrible neck pain, headaches that come & go on one side followed by extreme fatigue, nausea and internal tremors. 

It was weird because I wasn’t feeling anxious but that internal tremor feeling made me think it had to be panic. I started to make the connection that these episodes were usually triggered by any type of msg (that sh*t is in practically everything under different names), yogurt, excess caffeine & aged cheeses. 

Finally saw a neurologist & was diagnosed with VM. I do also have TMJ which I’m sure is a contributing factor, but it was like a veil was lifted when I got diagnosed because I thought I was having all these separate issues (sinus pain, neck pain, face tightness & nausea). 

I’m really trying to clean up my diet because literally everything I was ingesting is a trigger ( artificial sweetener, chocolate, citrus, cheese & coffee).

1hfja50,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1hfja50/winter_wear_and_winter_weather_etiquette_for/,Winter wear and winter weather etiquette for Chicago noob?,"Hey Chicagoans and Chicago experts!

TL;DR - Asking for Chicago-specific advice and etiquette relating to cold weather and winter clothing for when I move to Chicago in February!

\---

For context, I am a consultant, and I will have to commute into the loop at least once or twice a week. That will involve a 1 mile walk to the Metra station, walking from the downtown station to my clients' office, walking around midday for coffee and lunch in the city, often with clients, and then walking to and from the Metra on for my commute home. I'm coming from a part of the country that has a fairly mild winter. I grew up in an area with snow and snow sports within day-trip distance, but really haven't had to deal with cold and/or snow on the ground day-in and day-out for months at a time. So, I know how to dress for snow sports, but I'm thinking that style isn't going to be entirely appropriate for city life.

Underlayers: So far I've been focusing on layering, making sure that I have a week's worth of soft, neutral colored, moisture-wicking base layers that can be worn under any long sleeve top and wide leg pants or a suit - think tank top, coordinating fitted long sleeve top, fitted leggings, and slightly larger lined leggings with a smooth outer fabric. I feel pretty good about that, since these are clothing items that won't be visible. My only concern will be getting too warm while in the office, but I could always go to the ladies' room, undress, remove my second/warmer layer of underclothes, put them in my bag, and put my office clothes back on. Sounds a bit exhausting, but it beats freezing on my commute I guess!

Outerwear: This decision seems more high-stakes since it will be the first impression anyone has of me out of doors or entering a building. I'm now shopping for a coat, and I'm thinking a neutral puffer coat would be pretty versatile and warm. Curious though, is a puffer coat appropriate for the downtown corporate environment, or does it seem more like weekend wear? Should I instead go with a long, belted wool coat as my winter outerwear staple, or some other option? Can I really get away with wearing the same coat every day, assuming that I accessorize it with different hats and scarves, or do I need to have at least two coats to switch between? If anyone has a favorite go-to brand for work-appropriate women's coats I'm all ears!

Shoes: I did an internship in NYC (though it was over 15 years ago) where I saw people wear snow boots to commute and walk in to the office and then switch to a work-appropriate shoe once they are in the building. Is that something people typically do in Chicago as well these days? Where does this footwear switcheroo take place, and where do people like me (who don't have a dedicated office/desk in the building) store their snow boots during the workday? One thought I had was to get a gym membership in a central downtown location, close to my clients' offices, and rent a locker in the locker room where I could shed my practical winter gear for some professional footwear. Is that overkill? Again, brands would be helpful here if anyone has advice for women's shoes/snow boots for work days.

Etiquette: Coming in from the cold, my face is typically red, my lips are blue, my nose is running like a faucet, and my hair is disheveled and staticky from my hat and scarf. I don't really want to walk straight into the office looking like that, unless that's what everyone does? Is it expected that people disappear into the restrooms to touch up their makeup and hair after their commute or their lunch hour, or will I appear fussy if I do that? What about hand-shaking when first walking in from outside? Remove one or both gloves, shove the gloves into a purse or coat pockets, then shake hands? Also, and finally, is it okay to ride the Metra and walk around with a thermos of hot coffee in and out of the office? Can I bring my thermos to local coffee shops and ask for refills, or should I leave it in my bag for lunch and coffee breaks? Does it have to be some trendy thing that matches my outfit, or can it be basic and serviceable?

Identity and Belonging: When does one ""become a Chicagoan""? In New York they like to say it takes least ten years to become a New Yorker. Any similar ""belonging gatekeeping"" in the great white city, the urban jewel of the Midwest? I grew up visiting my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins in Minnesota (my parents' birthplace), and I definitely have the slightest hint of an accent - enough for people to ask constantly if I'm from Minnesota, lol. Not sure if that will help me blend in once I get to Chicago or just make me sound like a Minnesotan, but hey, guess I'll find out! :)

Monday I thought I might have eaten something bad. Tuesday I wondered if I was getting sick. I think it wasn't until Thursday I finally realized this must be what people mean when they talk about feeling nauseated. It wasn't all day, but it also wasn't only right after eating. As I paid more attention, it seemed like I was in a pattern: feel hungry, eat something, even just a bite of something, feel nauseated for hours.

The first day, when I thought it was a reaction to something, I laid in bed wondering if I needed to sleep on the bathroom floor to be near the toilet. But I decided I probably would have enough warning if the nausea became acute enough for me to actually vomit, and it never did, and I never did. Instead I just had a vague sense of queasiness about half the time, a background feeling that might have been relieved by either vomiting or pooping, thought neither was in store for me the first couple of days. 

On Wednesday, I drove somewhere, then stayed in the car and focused on not moving until it was time to drive back home. That was the worst it got. The thought of getting up out of the car didn't seem worth the risk of whatever might happen out of one end or the other, but sitting still seemed fine. By the next day, it was starting to fade.

It was much less pronounced after that, and as I type this on Monday, a week after it started, I'm realizing that I'm sitting here with a cup of coffee and a banana and feeling no nausea at all. Perhaps after the banana, perhaps not.

Two holiday parties this week, and a kitchen full of goodies, but I don't think I ate any more than usual, though what I ate was probably more calorie-dense and carb-dense than usual. I had a very good reminder to stick with my official weekly weigh-ins this week, as \*someone\* had left the scale out Saturday morning, and I was frustrated to see that I was down only a half-pound at that point. But I told myself only Sunday morning post-shower counts, and I'm glad I did, because I ended up being down 2.8 lbs the very next day. The body is weird!

In a significant move to enhance digital payments in Egypt, Mastercard, in partnership with the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and the Egyptian Banks Company (EBC), has launched Apple Pay for users in the country 🚀. This initiative marks a major step towards promoting a cashless economy and modernizing Egypt's financial sector 💳.

What is Apple Pay?

Apple Pay is a service that allows users to make payments using their Apple devices such as iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads, and Macs 📱. It provides a secure, convenient, and private way to pay for goods and services both in-store and online 🛍.

How Does Apple Pay Work?

To use Apple Pay, customers simply need to add their credit or debit cards to the Wallet app on their Apple device. Here’s a step-by-step guide:
- Open the Wallet app on your iPhone 📲.
- Tap the ""+"" icon to add a new card ➕.
- Follow the prompts to add your credit or debit card details 💳.
- Once the card is added, you can use Apple Pay on your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac 🖥.

To make a payment in-store, users double-click the side button on their iPhone or Apple Watch and hold the device near a payment terminal. The payment is authenticated using Face ID, Touch ID, or the device passcode, along with a one-time unique dynamic security code, ensuring a secure transaction 🔒.

Benefits of Apple Pay

Apple Pay offers several benefits:
- Security: The actual card numbers are not stored on the device or Apple servers 🔐.
- Convenience: Users can make payments without needing to create accounts or repeatedly type in card details, shipping, and billing information 🏦.
- Wide Acceptance: Apple Pay is accepted in various places such as grocery stores, pharmacies, taxis, restaurants, coffee shops, and retail stores 🏪.

Partners Involved

The launch of Apple Pay in Egypt is a result of collaboration between several key entities:
- Mastercard: A leading global payment technology company 🌍.
- Central Bank of Egypt (CBE): The central bank of Egypt, responsible for regulating the country's financial sector 🏛.
- Egyptian Banks Company (EBC): The technological arm of the CBE, responsible for developing and operating payment infrastructure in Egypt 🖥️.

Impact on Egypt’s Financial Sector

This initiative is part of a broader strategy to modernize Egypt’s financial ecosystem and promote digital transformation 🔄. According to Ehab Nasr, Assistant Sub-Governor at the CBE, ""With Apple Pay now available in Egypt, we are ushering in a new era of digital payments that aligns with our proactive efforts to promote digital transformation and foster a more inclusive, cashless economy"" 💡.

Tarek Raouf, Executive Chairman and CEO of EBC, emphasized that the launch of Apple Pay represents a major advancement in Egypt’s financial sector, easing digital transactions and contributing to the development of a broader digital payments ecosystem 📈.

Financial Inclusion and Economic Growth

The introduction of Apple Pay is expected to drive significant growth in electronic payment transactions 📊. Estimates suggest that the value of point-of-sale (POS) transactions in Egypt could surge to approximately EGP 640 billion by the end of 2024, a 280% increase from 2021 📈. This growth underscores the increasing appetite for digital financial solutions in Egypt, fueled by advancements in fintech and higher smartphone penetration 📱.

Other Initiatives

In addition to Apple Pay, Egypt is also enhancing its digital payment infrastructure through other initiatives 🌐. For example, Visa has partnered with EBC and the CBE to facilitate international remittances for Egyptians living abroad, leveraging Visa’s advanced digital financial services and EBC’s technological infrastructure 🤝.

Conclusion

The introduction of Apple Pay in Egypt marks a significant step towards a more digital, secure, and convenient payment system 🔄. This collaboration between Mastercard, CBE, and EBC is integral to Egypt’s broader efforts to modernize its financial sector, promote financial inclusion, and foster a cashless economy 🌐. As Egypt continues to embrace technological innovation, these initiatives are set to transform the way people make payments, making financial transactions easier, faster, and more secure 💼.

1hfj39t,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1hfj39t/mil_ignores_me/,MIL ignores me,"Bear with me it’s a long story. My husband (24m) and I (23f) have been together for 6 years and married for 2 years. We just had a baby girl in the summer of 2024. 

So a year ago we started trying for a baby. At that time we were in good terms with his family I loved them and I thought they loved me, I thought they were like a second family to me. I wasn’t ready to tell our families we were trying to have a baby yet but I was close to my sister in law (18f) so I told her to keep it a secret. 

Not long after that it was my husband’s birthday so I arranged with my mother in law to have a small gathering at her place and to get there early to help cooking. His family is Mexican. My family members who were invited were exited to learn how to make authentic Mexican food (to which my mil agreed to) So everyone arrived early (like 5 minutes after me and my husband had arrived) and helped cooking the food in the kitchen. Including mil, sil and my husband there was about 8 persons in the kitchen which is small. 

We were about 12 to 15 people. Since there were already a lot of people in the kitchen I entertained the other guests. At some point there was some ingredients missing so I went with my dad to a few grocery stores to find it, we bought it and came back. The evening went on great, or so I thought. 

For context I am very open. I was raised that way, I rarely judge, there is no taboo for me and my family we have just always been that way. I have one girl friend, I have always had an easier time being friends with guys. I am loyal to my husband. I am not interested in anyone else he is the only for me. But yes I have guy friends. 

Dinner was good everyone was smiling and talking. Anyway so it just so happened that I made a few jokes identical to the ones my guy best friend did and they were ok with it. Like slapping a guy on the thighs because we were joking around and like ruffling his hair. That guy just happens to be my sister in law’s boyfriend. Anyway later it was time for desert, it was good with everyone except me. Now hear me out I have a repulsion for anything that contains coffee I have always been this way. I tried many times to drink it but every time I vomit it out immediately and the smell makes me very nauseous. The cake was milk and coffee flavoured but I didn’t know that, seing the colour I thought it was chocolate and I love that. 

As soon as I put it in my mouth I almost vomited but I didn’t want to be disgusting and dirty everyone so I ran to the bathroom and spit it out. I never said it was bad but when I went back to the table I had to explain that I don’t like coffee and it tasted like it. So the following week my mil and sil talked with my husband while I was at work. So this is what my husband told me was said. Sil told him I stopped the contraceptive pill and asked if he was aware. To which he said he was of course because it’s a decision we had made together. Then she proceeded to say I was indecent and made her and her boyfriend uncomfortable talking about sex and touching him. ( the boyfriend is a mechanic and had told us about more extreme jokes his guy friends had made with him and he was ok with those I only had said as a joke that “some things needed taking care of” while discretely eying sil back and forth for him to get it). She said told my husband it was as if I cheated to act that way with a guy in front of my husband. They added that I was supposed to help cooking but didn’t. That I was rude to say i didn’t like the desert and that I was steeling all the attention at HIS birthday. 

A month or 2 later when we tried to have a discussion the 4 of us together sil was very mean, insulted my husband to the point where he shed a few tears. Mil didn’t even listen, tuned us out the whole time. Sil even confirmed that the joke was ok coming from my guy friend (who is bisexual) but not ok when it’s me because I’m a girl and it’s not appropriate she felt like I was the perv uncle that evening. After the talk before leaving I told mil that I had been doing everything their way and tried everything to have them love me and be accepted for 6 years. I had been doing all the effort in the relationship so I told her if you want to fix the relationship you will have to make the efforts now because I was done trying to please them. They broke my heart I sincerely loved them. 

So they didn’t talk to me for a year, my husband went to see them like 3 to 4 times since then. They live next door which really sucks but since I became pregnant really fast we couldn’t move and we couldn’t afford to move since I’m the only one with a job in our couple. They weren’t there the whole time for us during the pregnancy while on the other side my parents helped a lot, they even organized the baby shower. 

Fast forward to this summer our baby girl was born and the day after (still at the hospital) my husband calls his mom to tell her. She was of course supper happy and wanted to meet her the same day. I was tired so I said I didn’t mind. She came to our place when we got home after my parents made us dinner and spent the afternoon with us because THEY came to pick us up at the hospital and they cared about me having just given birth. (I’m an only child by the way) She talked only to my husband, congratulated him only for the baby, ignored me even thought I was right there and gave me a hello and bye. 

Our baby is now 4 months old and she came a few times since then and always the same thing she takes my daughter speaks to her in Spanish as If it’s her own daughter and tells her to call her abuelita (which is like grandma in Spanish), speaks to my husband and ignores me except to say hello and bye. My husband already told her to stop ignoring me it worked a little but not much. 

I was very disappointed to learn that they never liked me, that they thought I was tricking my husband into having a baby with me, that I was cheating on him just because I was talking to sil boyfriend and touched him. I was just trying to make him feel like he was part of the family since I had such a hard time to feel like a part of the family. They are sexist and conservatives. (Even though we were married in church before having a baby but whatever.) Me and my husband agreed that she can see her once a month maximum and she will not be called grandma because that term is earned and I feel like she doesn’t deserve it. 

I really don’t want her to see, touch or talk to my daughter at all but my husband wants our daughter to know her at least.

I was recommended both the You and the GS3, and wanted to know which is recommended. 

My concern with the GS3 AV is how easy is it to dial in coffee every day and would the app help with pre-infusion? Is it that much better than the You?  


I've never used either of them, and I really would like to know which can make my life easier, but also give me the capabilities to bring out the best of my beans for people to try.

1hfiu7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hfiu7s/chronic_bad_breath/,Chronic Bad Breath,"Age: 43

Gender: Male

Height: 5'11""

Weight: 180lbs

Smoker: No (Never have been)

Duration: 12+ years. Possibly my whole life.

Location of Issue: Mouth. Possibly related to sinuses or gut health.

Medications:   
Sertraline for depression and anxiety.  I did not take it through this whole period of having bad breath.  
Azelastine HCI nasal spray for ""non-allergic rhinitis"".

  
My wife notices that I have unreasonably bad breath. It lingers after brushing, mouth rinse, drinking water. Eating and drinking water does seem to make it better. Anxiety seems to make it worse. It seems very prominent if I only drink coffee and not water. She said sometimes it is at a 10 on a 1-10 scale. When that happens, I'm emanating the smell when I talk, even from a distance. It only ever gets down to a 2 or a 3 at best. She says it is always something she can smell when she gets close to me.

It has been around since we began our relationship 12 years ago and she considered not dating me because of it. We don't talk about it a lot because it is uncomfortable and she felt judgy and knows I was self-conscious. She says it doesn't smell like regular bad breath from just hygiene.

A few things to note:

Brushing teeth, flossing, and using mouth rinse does not make it go away. It does mask it to an extent, but does not fully alleviate it. It is present even when my oral hygiene is perfect.

I'm always thirsty. I can drink three big 40oz cups of water and my mouth will feel swampy.I was tested for diabetes and it came back negative.

I have sinus issues. I've always dealth with what I thought were allergy problems. I often have the sniffles at any given time. Sometimes it feels like my nose is a faucet that someone turned on.  Last year around this time I was having what I thought were 3+ allergy attacks a day. It was the worst it had ever been. I finally went to an allergist and after a back-prick test was told I was not allergic to anything and instead had ""non-allergic rhinitis"" and was given a nasal spray. It was like night and day.  I took it consistently for a few weeks and my attacks went away and I had so many fewer nasal issues. I felt like a normal person.  Now I still have some issues and take it as necessary. I've noticed more congestion and drainage since the cold weather has come on.

I suffer from anxiety. I am managing it mentally and trying not to let it rule my decisions. (When I was younger, social anxiety would keep me from being able to do things like go to the grocery store by myself, but that is long past.) I take a small dose of sertraline to take the edge off, but I can feel it present in my body at many times, and often I don't know what's causing it.

I can't smell the bad breath. When it is very bad I can notice an intense swampiness in my mouth, but for the most part I'm oblivious. I had even thought it went away after the nasal spray treatment.

I've asked other people close to me about the bad breath. Some have noticed it and others haven't at all. I do remember ex partners mentioning it sometimes but I had thought it was just normal bad breath and would just go brush my teeth or do a mouth rinse.  Once again, I think they may not have wanted to talk about it as it is a bit of a offensive subject.

I've asked multiple doctors and dentists about it. They thought it might be throat stones. I've had a few of those but not very often. They suggested mouth wash, but that just masks it as I mentioned.

I think it may begin in my gut or related to my sinuses. I want to visit a professional that can understand what's going on and help but I'm not sure where to start. The doctors I've talked to haven't taken it very seriously and they obviously don't want to smell my breath to see if it's ""normal"".

Currently using a C40 with a 3d printed mod to give it a RedClix level of adjustment, but hand gridding beans at 5am sucks and I wanna a flat burr grinder anyways.

I pre-ordered a **DF54**, but those won't be in stock or ship until mid to late January, and I don't mind waiting if it's the right choice, but maybe other choices are equal or better where I dont have to wait?

Was also looking at the **Timemore 064 and 078s** grinders. I know they're more expensive, but they seem quieter, flat burrs and I love the design aesthetic as well.

I understand I can get the **DF64** now, but it's sorta big, loud and I like the smaller DF54/ 064, or just the design and quietness of the Timemore grinders more.

Is reliability on the Timemore okay? I know they've only been out for like a year or so, so maybe hard to gauge long term, but from use case to those who used or have one.

I primarily like medium to lighter roasted coffees, and wanna extract those fruity flavors more if I can.

1hfiqln,https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/1hfiqln/where_do_i_go_from_here/,Where do I go from here?,"Good morning r/ENTJ,

I hope this post finds you well. I cannot say the same about the one who is posting it.

Per my user flair, I’m a 23M ENTJ 8w7 sx/so. As you might expect, I’m having the sort of trouble you’d expect a guy with every other strength to have. Typical, isn’t it?

I do not have any experience with women. Perhaps at least one has shown me interest at some point in my life, but recent events make even that presupposition irrational. It’s certainly not for lack of trying. I’m not interested in meaningless sex; I lead an active social life for its own merits. I refuse to waste time ruining my self-esteem on dating apps and wasting time/money at bars and nightclubs like so many of my friends have with little to show for it. Nevertheless, I regularly meet new women and pursue the ones who meet my expectations (all of which I, of course, myself meet). Even so, the closest I’ve gotten to a relationship wasn’t even fucking real. It was quite fucked up honestly, but that’s a story for another day.

The latest L in a saga of endless L’s was with a girl in one of my classes. I asked her out for coffee after the end of the semester and *of course* she’s in a relationship (as gracious as she was in letting me know). Maybe she’d’ve said yes if she was single, but that’s just copium. I was really expecting otherwise given certain signals, but then I talk to those of my friends who seemingly have no trouble with dating and the signals they get… it’s quite obvious my assumptions have always been egotistical delusions. An honest ego would drop a girl the second she’s not clearly obsessive. In this case, I should’ve known as soon as she wasn’t clamoring to meet with me in person when we were paired together for a project. This goes back to my earlier statement about the most rational presupposition being that no girl has ever been interested in me; every warrant for its complement doesn’t stand up to scrutiny when compared to the cases (such as the aforementioned) which support my presupposition. It’s all quite pathetic, truth be told.

Returning to what I said about my expectations, it’s honestly not that long of a list: American, female, aged 20–23, attracted to men, not actively dating anyone, has a compatible personality (not looking at MBTI), shares my sense of humor, shares my values, and is a fellow 2nd-gen immigrant Catholic (for cultural compatibility). However, running a Fermi estimate on this returns only ~20,000 women who are within these parameters. That’s 0.5% of women within my age cohort, scattered around the country. I will not settle for less than my very reasonable standards. The biggest cut is due to desiring someone who shares my sense of humor (i.e., someone who is liberal/progressive but not “woke,” as much as I cringe at the use of the term). Our culture has shifted in a tragic direction since the Obama years. That’s not something I can control, and I’m starting to understand why some guys my age exclusively pursue women in their 30’s (not that I ever could).

I must disclaim that I do not blame women for this whatsoever. I must also disclaim that yes, I am impeccably hygienic and well-groomed. (Honestly ridiculous and patronising that these’re the assumptions which get made when a guy is struggling on this front.) I’m incredibly confident/charismatic, funny, intelligent, ambitious, and have strong convictions in a cohesive worldview. I’m always doing something interesting and have new stories to tell. If only I was born 10–15 years into a less atomised culture, I’d likely be preparing to propose to my girlfriend right now.

Oh, I should mention that my despair is because I just finished my last semester of college. Not that it’s a huge accomplishment of course; this was a foregone conclusion. What it actually means is that I failed miserably. Meeting women becomes almost impossible post-graduation if you don’t plan to pursue higher education. Dating apps and nightlife are beneath me, you can’t meet at work, it’s all young men and old people at church, friends don’t introduce you to anyone anymore, and it’s even taboo to date in your hobby groups. COVID really did ruin everything. And now, all of my friends (single and taken) make it clear that if you don’t find someone by 25, it’s over. All the good ones get snapped up by then so you’re stuck with the leftovers (of which you are one, so you deserve it), and you can’t date someone too much younger or you’ll have nothing in common. That gives me 2 years, and I sincerely doubt much will change.

As a Catholic, I am required come to terms with my destiny. I used to pray that God would bring my wife into my life; now I thank Him for demonstrating that His divine providence does not include a plan for romantic companionship. If I recognise His divine providence, then I must recognise that everything that happens is for the greater good. I have been blessed with various elements of happiness in my life; after all, Job (a figure of legend, but I digress) suffered extensively and still did not waver in his faith. And so I assent of will that which I have of intellect. I trust that God’s plan for me is for greatness in my career and for me to serve the American people. Like King Solomon (also legendary), I am to climb the ranks of political power and simply use scores of women to satisfy the carnal passions of concupiscence. I will then receive a plenary indulgence on my deathbed to remit for my sins in my final days. This life is totally meaningless; we all live for the next.

My lamentations here are done. Time to leverage the Te-Se loop I’ve been thrown into and tie up any loose ends in my life before I move to its next stage. Would love to hear your thoughts.

**TL;DR:** Zero luck with women, zero reason that should be the case, zero hope, zero reason to care. C’est la vie.",1,1734354634.0,entj,0,1.0,False

The soft hum of quiet conversations filled the air as Ella and James sat at a small table by the window. The evening sun dipped below the horizon, casting warm hues across the sky. Inside the cozy café, candlelight flickered on their table, casting shadows that danced along the walls lined with books and plants.

James reached across the table, gently taking Ella’s hand. She smiled, a soft blush coloring her cheeks. In that simple gesture, there was a shared understanding, a quiet connection that spoke louder than words ever could.

“Do you remember the first time we met here?” Ella asked, her voice soft but full of warmth.

James chuckled, squeezing her hand. “How could I forget? You were lost in the menu for an hour, trying to pick the perfect coffee.”

Ella laughed, her eyes twinkling in the dim light. “It was a tough decision. But I think I finally made the right choice.”

Their smiles lingered, and for a moment, the world outside the café faded away. It was just the two of them, caught in the magic of shared moments and quiet affection.

No grand gestures, no extravagant plans—just a peaceful evening, the comfort of each other’s presence, and the promise of many more to come.

1hfiq6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1hfiq6p/home_coffee_machine_and_dark_roast_coffee/,Home Coffee Machine and Dark Roast Coffee Recommendations,"Hi, everyone! I recently came across this subreddit, so I thought I'd ask the people here the same old story about recommendations but with my background, which is as follows:

* I switched from instant coffee to ground coffee 4 years ago with the **Morphy Richards Europa**, which had been a gift.
* Over the years, I've come to know more about coffee and brewing. In particular, I've realized that I prefer a **dark roast.** I've tried many brands like Blue Tokai, Toffee Coffee Roasters, Third Wave Coffee, Sleepy Owl, Colombian Brew, Starbucks, etc. So far, my favorites have been the **Vienna Roast** from Blue Tokai and the **Sumatran Dark Roast** from Starbucks.
* I drink mostly **black coffee**/Americano and **espresso**/doppio. I've used a French press, Moka pot, and Channi in the past but now I use a full Hario V60 set for my black coffee, including a hand grinder and (basic, i.e. no temperature control) gooseneck kettle. But, the only real espresso I've had so far is at cafes.
* I typically make **1-2 cups** at a time. The volume of each cup varies and doesn't matter in the following.

My primary motivation for this post is to replace the Morphy Richards Europa with a new **home coffee machine** that can produce **espresso** as well as drip coffee or, at least, **Americano** (for when I'm not in the mood to use the V60 for my black coffee).

**My budget is 40k INR, including any necessary accessories**. Of course, the cheaper the better because I don't want the best taste in the world - A respectable taste is good enough.

The Morphy Richards Duopresso seems perfect on paper but it seems that, in reality, it's not a good investment.

Let me now ask you a few questions that I hope you can help me out with:

1. Is the **De'Longhi Dedica 685** a good enough choice for my purposes, especially for dark roasts? The coffee temperature of the Dedica is about 90 degrees Celsius and dark roasts typically need 80-85 degrees. There are some other entry-level De'Longhi products too like the Stilosa and ones without any specific names (just codes) but I don't know how they hold up to the Dedica.
2. Why is the Dedica **not** considered a true espresso machine by some people?
3. What **alternatives** do I have?
4. What **accessories** would you suggest (grinders, tampers, portafilters, etc.)? Would a dark roast need a coarser **grind size** for a machine as well, like it does for a V60?
5. What (dark roast) **coffee** would you suggest?
6. Are there any machines (**espresso+drip**) like the Morphy Richards Duopresso that are actually good but don't break the bank?
7. What **thermometers** would you suggest for measuring the water temperature? Or should I invest in a **temperature-controlled kettle?** If so, please suggest some options (I plan to use this for my V60 setup as well).
8. Is it possible to estimate how much **resting time** (off the heat) I need to let freshly boiled water (with an approximate volume of 150-300 ml) for it to reach 80-85 degrees?

If anyone needs more information about anything before they can give me concrete suggestions, I'll be happy to keep updating this post. My DMs are open too, if anyone wishes to voice their opinion but doesn't wish to go against the consensus out of fear of getting downvoted.

Coupled with - outdoor cold and less activity - weight gain.

Starts with today’s breakfast - because the past is beyond us. Now is what we can do. 

So. Coffee - black. (My preferred prep). Overnight oats. And left over swordfish to round out protein.

# St. Lucia festival opens Yule season at Dorchester

St. Lucia’s Day (Dec. 13) is celebrated in Sweden as the first day of the Christmas season, and is a custom which has carried over to this country. The Al Johnson family at Sister Bay observes the custom and last Friday afternoon the Johnson children and several others brought this delightful ceremony to residents of the Dorchester.

St. Lucia’s role is usually played by the oldest daughter in the family. She is dressed in a long white robe with a red satin sash around her waist and wears a crown of lingonberry leaves and lighted white candles.

Early in the morning on St. Lucia’s Day she wakens the fam­ily and serves them coffee, saffron buns and cookies, all the while singing the old song “Santa Lucia.”

The Festival of Lights is a day of great celebration and the Christmas season opens with a joyous start.

Mrs. Pat Conlon, herself a native of Sweden, played the part of St. Lucia in Friday’s presenta­tion at the Dorchester and wore the traditional wreath of candles in her hair. Some of the older women there were a bit afraid her hair would catch on fire, but she has been taking this part for several years and knew just how to carry her head to avoid tilting the candles and dripping hot wax.

Annika Johnson, Heidi and Pamela Gustafson joined Mrs. Conlon, wearing the traditional costume of white but carrying a lighted white candle in their hands, just a bit safer for the younger girls. Lars and Rolf Johnson also joined in and the boys wore a high white pointed hat and white outfits, carrying candles.

After they had marched around the recreation room at the Dor­chester several times singing Santa Lucia they all served coffee, saffron buns and cookies to all the Dorchester residents. The party was much enjoyed and several of them were of Swedish ancestry and remembered the festival from their youth.

The Johnson children are those of Mr. and Mrs. Al Johnson, and the Warren Gustafsons are the parents of Heidi and Pamela, all of Sister Bay.

TLDR. It has been a year since my divorce has been over. Here’s what happened in the last year.

Hey champions. Today February 17th is a year since my marriage with Jane ended. I’ve received several requests for an update. I feel I owe that to all of you who helped me in the darkest period in my life.

Since early 2023 guys at the gym started calling me “Abuelo” (Grandpa) because literally I’m the oldest person practicing kickboxing. My hair is completely black, but I’ve noticed I have some gray hair here and there. I don’t mind the nickname because it means I’m one of the guys. Some of them have approached me for an old-man’s advice such as how to manage taxes, how to wear a tie, help to polish their resumé for a good job hunt. I follow my training and diet almost religiously. My weight may have not decreased but my body fat did. I’m around 20% fat, a huge accomplishment for me!

Not everything has been peaches and cream. I got injured at the gym. I was training at the same peace as the young ones, but my body couldn’t keep up. I got a muscle tear on my shoulder that took several months to heal. Also at sparring I was KOed badly. Abraham has asked me to slow down and practice something less stressing for my body like yoga or aikido, so I switched for the second option where I’ve found people about my age but I’m thinner and more muscular. I’m sticking to martial arts.

All my living expenses are paid by the rental of my apartment, so most of my salary is saved since Samantha (my dog) and I live a very frugalist life. The promotion I mentioned previously was given to another colleague. He does deserve it. There will be another in the future. It requires me to improve my English skills and study a second mastery degree.

I did take dancing lessons. At the beginning I was very stiff but I’ve been improving slowly. Also I hired a music teacher to learn to play the keyboard. I keep busy myself.

As for dating, some guy from the gym helped me to create a tinder profile but none of the ladies there caught my interest. Most of them are looking for hook ups, a sugar daddy, or just somebody to be unfaithful with. While I’m looking for a more mature relationship.

The first relationship I had after my divorce was a real nutcase. First, we need to talk about my mom’s sister. She’s truly a kind soul, always tries to help however sometimes her help causes some trouble since she tends to misunderstand, or she makes wrong assumptions. Let’s call her Aunt Angie. In December 2022, Angie called me to see if I’m free for a blind date. Since she’s one of my favorite aunts I accepted, she told me the girl was the daughter of her neighbor. I wanted more details, but she told me I will have to find out at the date. Aunt Angie texted me the place and date the following day. We met at lunch time at a familiar restaurant, I know places more romantic to eat and have a nice time, but the lady wanted to eat there. I arrived on time, I’m always very punctual but she came almost half an hour late with her kid, a chubby 10 years old boy glued to his cellphone. Let’s call them Jessica and Kevin. I didn’t mind but I thought it was weird to bring your child to a blind date. About Jessica, she’s about 35, chubby and pretty with a big cleavage and very high heels. She was wearing a lot of make-up and huge eyelashes I really dislike. Those remind me of women who go heavy on the silicone and their body looks deformed instead of esthetic. I thought let’s give it a shot. She was all smiles and greeted me with a kiss on my cheek. Kevin and I shared a handshake, he looked at me for a second a then returned to his loud game (no idea what he was playing I just heard gunshots, screams and explosions)

After some pleasantries I noticed Jessica was focused on my assets; she asked me about my job, my car also my salary. She knew I own an apartment (thanks to Aunt Angie). I answered with general responses which she didn’t like, she wanted exact numbers. I told her I don’t like discussing such matters and she smiled but something changed in her mood, she was annoyed. Then I asked about her life. She told me she wouldn’t tell me about her income which I hadn’t asked. She is a transcriptionist. She receives voice recordings and transcribes them into written reports, she can do it from home and take care of Kevin, she looked at her boy and smiled while petted his hair, Kevin didn’t notice the gesture, he was still playing with his mouth opened. I asked what he was playing and Jessica answered for him, the kid seemed completely oblivious to his surroundings. We ordered food, I was starving since I only had a sandwich and a protein shake as breakfast. Kevin made a little tantrum because there wasn’t his favorite burger on the menu. I told him there are other delicious hamburgers he can eat, he grabbed his paper napkin and throw it to me, I said “That wasn’t a nice thing to do”. Jessica told me to never speak to her kid like that. She smooched the boy’s cheek and promised he would like the new burger. The kid with tears in his eyes nodded and returned to his game. The rest of the date was not so bad, fortunately Kevin’s phone’s battery died, so we had some peace… until the kid got bored and demanded her mom’s attention. I tried to grab his attention but he ignored me. Jessica said that’s because I’m a stranger and he taught him to ignore strangers. Fair enough.

We dated two more times, both times she brought Kevin with her. On the second date I suggested going to a park and I bought a soccer ball for Kevin in hope he would like to play anything else than videogames, but he wouldn’t. Kevin didn’t pay any attention to my gift. On the third date I bought him a kite which again he ignored and he was specially annoying throwing tantrums for the most idiotic reasons. I may have made a face of exasperation and Jessica got mad, I told her I would like to have a date only with her, go to a bar or another place made for grown-ups, (third date was at a McDonald’s) Jessica made the comment I only want to sleep with her. I said, “That’s the reason you carry your son with you?” She freaking nodded and said she doesn’t trust men. And gave a speech about how strong she is because men can’t control her. Here is when Jessica showed her true colors: She asked again how much I earn before I repeat my answer, she told me that if I wanted a relationship with her, I would have to meet her expectations and one thing that is obligatory is that I must give her my complete salary so she could manage it. Yeah, you read it right. I raised my eyebrows and thought “Nice meeting you, I’m out of here.” But at that moment our order was ready. Don’t judge me, it has been months since I ate a hamburger. So I stayed and asked “What are your expectations?” I don’t know if wolves smile, but I bet Jessica smiled like one. She started telling me all she wants, for example I can keep my car but I must buy her a new big one (about my car. I have a thing for small cars, instead of buying a new one I chose to repair mine and it works perfectly but Jessica thinks small cars are embarrassing). She’s not a maid, so all the chores at home will be my responsibility including cooking. She wanted to see my apartment to move there or to a bigger place if she dislikes it. I must pay her and her friends their going out, I asked how since she want to keep all my salary, she didn’t have an answer, but she did mention that the salary thing is for her recognizing me as a man. That’s what her father (now divorced to her cheating mother) used to do. The most ridiculous thing I must accept is that she is a free woman, meaning she can and will have male “friends” and I must be loyal to her. Also Kevin’s father is not out of the picture, he travels a lot and he’s not usually around but when he is in the city either she may ask me to sleep in a hotel or she may not come home. To all her expectations I answered “I see” or “I understand” never an affirmative answer. You might think I was angry, but I was amused. I thought these entitled narcissistic women were an exaggeration. Boy! They are real! Besides I thought it would be a good laughable story for my buddies at the gym. She asked me if I have any questions. I did, I wanted to know what she would bring to the relationship. According to her I must give her all my money and my loyalty, and turn a blind eye when she’s cheating, she repeated she’s a free woman and I said “And I am not stupid, I’m out of here” I stood up and she may have realized she was losing a good opportunity and desperately told me to sit and discuss it with her. She wanted to know what I was expecting from her. I repeated my question “What would you bring to the relationship?” She said with a smile “You will have a high value woman” I scoffed and said, “Is that it? That’s just extra baggage to my life” I turned around and she yelled at me calling me an ugly nobody that I don’t deserve her. I told her “You are right, I deserve better”. All people at the place were watching us, I said “Show’s over folks” and left. When I arrived home Jessica was calling me and I blocked her.

Later that same evening Aunt Angie called me very concerned because her friend (Jessica’s mom) called her demanding to know where I live. I invited her to have dinner and chat, she immediately said yes. She’s usually alone, her husband arrives late at night and her two boys left the nest about 10 years ago. So we met at a café close to her house and I told her about my last date with Jessica and she understood why her friend was so mad. She told me about the time when she spoke with Jessica’s mom about having a single beautiful daughter with a kid. She immediately thought about me divorcing Jane and wanting to have kids, so they arranged the blind date. Angie mentioned to her friend that I am a feminist, (old school feminism) in her case this means I respect women. But for Jessica and her mom this means I am a pushover (modern feminism). That was the reason for her entitlement. Aunt Angie told me about her friend´s affair that she denies but everybody at building knows that’s the reason of her divorce. Angie’s hairdresser saw her making out with another man. Also she told me Kevin’s father is a truck driver, but Jessica always says he’s traveling because of business.

I thought that would be the end of it, but they kept pestering aunt Angie. I asked her if she needs me to call the police but she said no unless they keep annoying her. I decided to unblock Jessica and called her. She was surprised, then she fake cried saying she missed me, she was sorry for what she had said and also Kevin asks everyday about me. She told me she just wants to see me once and that’s all she asks. I said I’ll see her if she promises to stop harassing my aunt. She promised. We 3 met at a park. Jessica hugged me and fake cried again (It’s unbelievable how fast she can open and close the tears) Kevin as always glued to the phone and ignoring me. But Jessica assured me he asked for me every day, he loves me and finally if I accept becoming his daddy. I squatted in front of Kevin and gently pushed down his phone and he looked at me. I smiled and asked “Hi Kevin. Do you know who I am?” The kid turned his head to her mom who was mouthing my name but he didn’t understand. He looked at me again and shrugged his shoulders. I moved his hair and let him continue playing. Jessica said “It’s …. It’s because he calls you another way” I turned and said, as you promised stop pestering my aunt or we’ll call the cops. She tried to stop me, she followed me and turned the tears again calling me heartless person, then she said if at least I can buy Kevin a Christmas present like a sayonara gift. I told her I already gave him a soccer ball and a kite, but she says he wants a videogame. By then we arrived at my car, I said, “ask his father, why don’t you sue him for child support?” And this time really was the las time I’ve seen her. Aunt Angie says she hasn’t seen them again.

My next relationship was from a match on tinder. Guys at gym helped me with the pictures. I’m a 5, but they made me look like a 7 with no filters, I was happy with the result. The match was a teacher, very pretty and independent, with no kids, and single, let’s call her Erika (F32). When I met her, I could see she was overweight, but we had great chemistry, she’s witty and very intelligent. We could talk for hours. She was as welcome to my home as I was at hers. We had very passionate nights. She told me I inspired her to return to the gym. This is the time when I had a muscle tear and I had to slow down with the work out. So we exercised together. At the end she was very sore, so she skipped 2 days. Then she returned and felt sore again, this time she skipped a week. She came back for 3 days and then suddenly she had a lot of excuses to avoid the gym. So I stopped asking. Some weeks later I was knocked out badly at sparring. At first, I was disoriented, then for the following days I was dizzy and had sudden nausea. Erika tried to stop me practicing martial arts, “They are too violent”, she told me she wouldn’t return to the gym because she was worried about me getting hurt again.

Why did we break up? There are two main reasons, the first one is that she had a crush on a colleague, and she acted on the crush. The second is the main reason and my excuse to end the relationship. But first you must know that she’s a gamer. I don’t have a problem with that, but she often avoids her responsibilities to play videogames, and she plays a lot of games. That’s when the problems started. She had always time to play but never to exercise or do her job. Once we didn’t sleep at all one night because she was late to complete a task that was due the following day and I helped her. This was getting on my nerves.

About a month later I met her goofy friends at a bar, we had some drinks. They weren’t easy on the alcohol and made fun of me because I only drank a couple of beers, that’s because I had to drive and I don’t drink a lot because of my training. These meetings took place every two weeks. Once they mentioned a new colleague that arrived at the school a couple of weeks after Erika and I met, let’s call him Ivan. Erika with sparkling eyes was saying that Ivan does a lot of exercise and he’s handsome, this was my first red flag, she didn’t put a cork on it. I didn’t want to sound paranoic, so I let it slide, but from there I paid close attention to her behavior. The next red flag: The last time we met she mentioned I can stay in since it looked like I wasn’t having a good time with her friends. I said that’s nonsenses and invited myself in. When we arrived, I noticed a new guy sitting with her friends. It was Ivan (M30). Erika was supposedly surprised. I chatted with him, he’s a cool guy and single with girlfriend. We both chat about the gym, exercising and shared some tips. Erika inserted herself into the conversation to tell him we both exercise a lot (It’s been about 3 months since she stopped going to the gym) I just nodded, I didn’t want to make her look bad in front of her friends. From there our intimacy slowed down.

The following week Ivan texted me. I didn’t give him my number, he got it from Erika. I asked if they both chat a lot, he told me it’s mostly her texting him. (How interesting). He doesn’t like chatting with female colleagues since his girlfriend is very insecure. That same day I confronted Erika at her home about our lack of intimacy and asked if she wants to end things. She told me she was sorry, that she doesn’t want us to break up, and we did it right there. Afterwards I asked if she had a crush on Ivan. She laughed and said she considers him like a little brother. I didn’t buy it.

On our last day together, I had to attend a meeting out of the city. According to my calculations I’d arrive home around midnight. I asked Erika to walk Sammy at 10pm she agreed. I pleaded her not to play videogames because she’d forget. She promised she wouldn’t play that night. During the day Ivan texted me if I would be going to the next meeting because Erika always insisted him on going. The first day when she acted surprised, she had invited him. Also she flirts a lot with him. I was going to confront her about this. I arrived home close to midnight and Sammy was hiding under the table. That was very strange of her, then Erika told me she had to beat her up because she peed inside the house. I argued that my dog has never done that before, and I demanded an explanation. Then she lied again telling me she was watching a movie and out of nowhere Sammy peed. I went to the living room where she had connected her devices to my TV. One of them was warm, meaning she had played. I spoke calmly. “You forgot to take out Sammy, right? Because you were playing, am I wrong?” She got defensive and started raising her voice, and so did I. I was angry she hurt my pet when she was in the wrong. She yelled I care more for a stupid dog than her feelings and then she said very hurtful things, like I’m her worst lover, I have never made her finish, and that she’s sure I’m going to die alone. That would have crushed the old me. I stopped arguing with her (What’s the point when she’s defending her wrongdoing?) and watched her ranting. She got angrier and angrier when I started ignoring her. At last, she finally stopped, I said, “Are you done? This is over”. One more thing I forgot to add to the list of her delightful qualities is that she’s very prideful. She took out her phone and contacted an Uber. Meanwhile, I was trying to convince Sammy to leave her hiding spot, she refused. When the Uber arrived, she said, “Make sure to send me my stuff”, after she left Sammy finally came out under the table. I had forgotten to confront her about her lies. The next day I bought a big box and put all her stuff in there. Clothes, shoes, toiletries, videogames, 2 consoles, even food she stored in my refrigerator that I don’t eat. I went to her apartment, put the box in front of the door and rang the bell. When she saw me, I said, “Here are your things, let me know if I missed something” And walked away, I heard her say “Wait!” I raised my hand and said, “You’re welcome!” and left. She tried to contact me, but I am no longer interested so I blocked her, the same day Ivan texted me saying he’s sorry Erika and I broke up, I thanked him and asked how he knew, Erika had told him.

A month later she came to my home all apologetic (I found out later she tried to kiss Ivan, but he refused and reported her to HR. Ivan told me himself, we’re good buddies now), but by then, by pure coincidence I was with my next relationship.

When Jane and I made the purpose of having a healthier life, the first step was to contact a nutritionist. Her name is Mayra, we scheduled a monthly appointment. When our results were showing and improving, the appointments were every 2 months, 3 months and nowadays every 6 months as a follow up. The last two sessions I went alone, Mayra asked me why Jane is not with me, I told her we had divorced. Then we chat for the rest of the session, she told me Jane and I were her most successful case, and she loves to brag to other patients about us. She said she remembers when I arrived all clumsy, chubby and shy, now I’m more extroverted and with a well worked body. She thought that was endearing, so she glimpsed the possibility of a relationship with her. She told me if I’m interested, she needs a +1 for her son’s wedding. I had to reject her because I was dating Erika, but a month later we ended up things and I texted Mayra. We met for a coffee. I asked if I still could be her +1. She said yes. She asked the reason of my change of mind. I told her about Erika and what she did to my pet. She got angry because she loves dogs. I asked if she was married, it turned out she’s divorced. She and her husband ended the marriage when her son was a kid. She had had boyfriends for the next years until the last guy got tired, a couple of months ago, because she doesn’t want to get married again. I learned she is a year older than me, but she looks like she’s in her 30s, beautiful face, thin body, and great sense of humor. I asked if it’s ok since I’m her patient so it would be unethical. She told me I can fire her as my nutritionist. At the end of the date I said “I guess I will have to find a new nutritionist” and she kissed me. She’s not looking for anything serious, she wants to have fun. I asked how many guys she’s having fun with. She looked offended; she told me I am the only one. When she knew I had divorced, she thought it was perfect timing, because that was the same day she decided to date again. She thinks god put me in her path for some reason. I agreed. Finally I asked if she wants us to be exclusive and she said it’s not necessary. She sees me as her FWB. So we started going out, have dates and lots of sex, she loves my tattoo. At her son’s wedding the dancing lessons were very useful. Her son was very cordial to me, but I could see a small “You don’t deserve my mom” glimpse in his eyes.

When Erika came to apologize Mayra was inside my home, she had slept with me and was wearing one of my shirts. I was wearing sandals, shorts and a t-shirt. Mayra came to the door when I was hearing Erika’s excuses. Mayra was purring and said to me: “Here’s your coffee, stud!” she gave me a cup of coffee and slapped my butt, then she looked at Erika and added “I’m sorry, I didn’t know we have company” she hugged me by my back and put her chin on my shoulder and one of her pedicured feet on my knee. Erika left with tears in her eyes, I told Mayra, “That was mean!”. She said “She’s the one who hurt Sammy, right?”. I asked “How do you know?” Then I noticed Sammy was hiding under the table again. Ok she may deserve it. The following week I texted Ivan and he mentioned Erika looks miserable.

On midst of September, it was a Saturday around 8pm, I was chilling out at home studying when suddenly I heard Jane hitting my door. I was very concerned; my first thought was that something happened to MIL or one of the twins. When I opened the door, she was in tears, she hugged me saying “I didn’t speak to him, I swear!” she buried her face on my chest when I heard “Babe, please talk to me!”. In front of me was standing Birdbrain wearing a sleeveless t-shirt. Jane hid behind me and shouted at him “Leave me alone!” by then Samantha started to bark, that made Birdbrain stop approaching. My anger kicked in and yelled “You heard her asshole! Fuck off!” Birdbrain ignored me and shouted at Jane “Babe, come with me, let’s talk” I stepped sideways and blocked his view, he looked at me and said “Come on man! You two are divorced, right? She is no longer your concern!” He was right, but I guess I hate more Birdbrain than I am mad at Jane. I told her “Go into my house and call emergencies” she obeyed. When the door closed, Birdbrain didn’t say a word he just stared at me with anger or hate. I started walking towards him, my fists clenched. He turned around and ran away! He got into a car that I hadn’t noticed; the driver gave me the finger and they left. Then I noticed Jane’s car was parked wrongly and still had the lights on. I entered my home, she hugged me again. She was a little incoherent and shaking. She apologized “I’m sorry, I brought him here” “I came because I don’t want him to know where I live” “I swear I didn’t speak to him”. I gave her a hot beverage to calm her down. When the police came (about 2 hours later), she filled a report, she was more in control of herself. According to Jane, Birdbrain was outside her gym waiting for her. When she saw him, she ran to her car and didn’t know what to do. She was looking for a police officer or a patrol but couldn’t find any. Finally, she decided to come to my home. When the cops left, they suggested to put a camera recording the exterior.

After I returned from walking Sammy. Jane asked If it’s ok to stay, “You always make me feel safe”. I agreed, but not hanky-panky. She smiled and accepted. She was still wearing her gym clothes; I told her to have a shower. She asked me if she can wear one on my shirts, I said sure (what do women have with men shirts?) She giggled and went to the bathroom. She did something that I think was intentional, she left her cellphone on the table while she took a shower. Perhaps she wanted me to snoop, but I didn’t. Why should I?

After calling SIL, we watched a movie, she was lying on the sofa, eventually she felt asleep. Watching her sleeping with a sad face made me think about the time when she and I were married. I will never trust her, but I do care about her. I admired her body, she’s still very attractive. I put a blanket on her and went to sleep. I had an erotic dream where Jane came to my room like a naked ghost ready to meet my most dirty fantasies.

Next day (Sunday) she woke up and said it’s been a long time since she’s slept that well. She was happy and prepared a nice breakfast while we discussed about Birdbrain, I had something nagging in my mind. How did he know how to find her? And how did he know we are divorced? She told me she may have mentioned she liked certain chain of gyms, so Birdbrain must have been checking all of them in the zone until he found her. Also it is obvious we are no longer married since she had to knock on my door and it’s not our previous address. I guess she may be saying the truth. She said she’s going to ask for a restriction order for him. I asked if she knows where he lives (Yeah, I’m that paranoic). Jane told me it’s obvious she doesn’t know, but it is very possible he will be guarding the gym where he was waiting for her. So she is going to pay somebody to serve him right there. She did that and the moron asked the lawyer who gave him the document where he can find Jane.

On November 19th, due to a liver disease my mom passed away. One day before my birthday. If I was devastated, my father and brother were in worst condition than me. My parents were married for 47 years, and my brother was my mom’s favorite. It’s impossible to put into words the sadness, the regret and all the pain we were feeling at that moment. I texted Mayra, she gave me her condolences and told me she will pray for my family. Next, I texted Jane, she didn’t answer, but 20 minutes later an Uber parked in front of the hospital and Jane got out with her eyes red and hurried to hug me and my family. My father, brother and his wife went to pray at the hospital’s chapel, the doctor gave me a list of all the documentation needed to release my mom’s body, also he advised me to bring an attire in which my mom would be cremated. Jane said, “I’m coming with you”. We went to my parent’s home to gather all documents. I was very sad, but Jane’s company helped me to stay focused. I wept a couple of times when I saw my mom’s clothes. So many memories. Jane was ready to comfort me. After that we went to my home to walk Sammy. I had a little chat with Jane when her father passed away, I was there to support her, she told me it is time for her to back me up, and I agreed. We returned to the hospital to hand the documents in. My father and brother were next to my mom’s empty bed, they had already contacted family and friends. I hugged them, my father thanked me for taking care of the process, he may not be able to do it. Jane was contacting the funeral staff. My father went to my brother’s home. I had to wait and sleep in the hospital and Jane stayed with me. By 4 in the morning somebody woke me up and told me everything is ready. I received the documents and sent them by text message to the funeral contact. The funeral arranger called me some minutes later, he told me they would take care of everything from there. He gave me the address and room where we can say goodbye to my mom. Jane and I went to grab a bite. After eating Jane asked me to take her home, I did, and she pleaded me not to go. SIL gave me her condolences. My Godkids were at home since it was a holyday, they showed me they were doing homework. I cheered just by talking to them. Jane came back rushing with a birthday gift for me. This put a smile on my face. It was a big box. She gave me a wallet and some supplements for the gym. Afterwards we went to my home to feed Sammy and I took a shower. It’s amazing how animals perceive sadness. I cried silently in the shower and Sammy was scratching the door, Jane took her from her collar to the dining room, but she returned and whined. When I came out of the bathroom, she jumped to lick my face like saying ‘Cheer up!’.

Jane and I arrived at the funeral room. After I identified myself, they told us my mom was already there and the embalming was scheduled by the next 2 hours. Meanwhile we bought some flowers and went to the closest supermarket to buy coffee, tea, bread, cookies etc. for the attendees. At our return they told me it is time to dress my mom, but I froze. 6 years ago when FIL died, we were in the same situation, somebody had to dress him. SIL’s husband and I did it and it’s a scene I’ll never forget. It took us a while to dress him and then somebody applied make up on his face to look more natural. All these thoughts came to my mind, I didn’t want them to be my last memories of my mom. Jane knew this so she stepped up. She told me she would take care of her. Jane and the staff did a great job. Somehow, they could put a little smile on her face, it looked like she was peacefully sleeping. Jane came to me, hugged me and cried. I understood. I did exactly the same thing 6 years ago. I don’t want to know what she saw.

Aunt Angie and all my piblings and most of my niblings and cousins were there, also my gym buddies, Abraham and Ivan showed up. Some of them remembered it was my birthday and gave me a bittersweet hug. I texted Mayra the address and room, but she told me she was very busy and she had to attend more patients the next day early, so she wouldn’t come. I accepted it, she didn’t meet my mom, besides she was clear from the beginning this was a casual relationship, I didn’t press it. Jane on the other hand was offering beverages and snacks but most of my relatives ignored her. I noticed my cousin Karen and some other glaring at her. That was not fair, she has been nothing but help to me and my family, she loved and respected my mom. She returned next to me with the tray full, she told me “I guess they are not hungry yet”. I put the tray on a table next to us and told her “I haven’t thanked you for all your help. I’ll do anything you want, just ask” She didn’t look at me “No need to thank me, she was like a mother to me too.” I put my arm on her shoulder “Anyway, I’m really grateful you are here” and kissed her forehead. A lot of people stared at us, I smiled to them but Jane seemed uncomfortable, she said “I’m going to see who wants a snack” and left. The tray was still on the table. Fortunately my relatives were kinder to her the rest of the process, but Jane didn’t come close to me until my mom was cremated, she hugged me very quickly and told me she had to go.

The next days were sad and chaotic. Mayra went to see me, she apologized she lied to me because she admitted sad people affects her. She wanted to have a date because that day was my birthday, instead, she stayed in and felt bad because it’s the first time she had lied and she’s aware of what lies can do to a relationship. I accepted her apologies, but I also told her I am not a very fun company at that moment, I was still mourning my mom. She said she was aware of that, she just wanted to come clean to me and perhaps cook and have dinner with me. I loved the idea.

In the following days Jane come to my house. I let her come in, she was mad and yelling, I had to lock Sammy up because she started barking to Jane. Then she demanded to know about the kiss I gave her. (I’m paraphrasing here, I don’t remember the exact words) I told her it was to tell my family we’re cool because I noticed they were being rude to her. Jane kept silent. Some tears came to her eyes “Don’t do that ever again” I was perplex, she continued yelling at me “You don’t know how hard was for me to get over you, and that kiss destroyed all therapy I had for the last months”. I apologized. I wasn’t thinking about her feelings at all. She continued “You just keep my hopes high, you F-ing AH!!” (wow! She cursed!) I looked at her like she was an alien, then she punched my arm and continued cursing me “F-ing idiot!! Scumbag!! Son of a B!!”, she started punching my arms and chest, I didn’t do anything, just let her rant. Her punches weren’t doing any damage, but they did hurt. She did it for several minutes while Sammy was barking in the next room. Jane was out of breath. I hugged her, somehow, I knew she needed to let this out. She looked intensely into my eyes, we kissed, completely making out. When we stopped, she called me Stupid and slapped me. I smiled I was so aroused to see this ferocious Jane. Finally, we ended up having intimacy very rough and vigorous. I missed that voluptuous body and her pretty face. We would have continued but Sammy needed to go out. When we were at the dog park we put the cards on the table. Jane already knew about my relationship with Mayra. I said I wouldn’t end it, although we’re in a FWB nonexclusive relationship. Jane said she understood. But she can’t have a relationship like that. I told her that’s the only relationship I can offer to her. She sighted and said she may cut ties with me for good. I asked what she will do from now. She said she didn’t know. I asked for another round since it seems it’s the last time we’ll see each other. She agreed and spent the night with me. The following weeks I didn’t hear from Jane, nor I asked. What a pity. Besides all the drama, she was a good friend.

I spent Christmas with my father and brother. We were very sad, my mom used to cook and now we three morons had to do it ourselves. It was a really good experience. We were busy with all the cooking. I had to give directions to my dad and brother since I was the only one that can cook. We made a very decent Christmas meal. I cooked a turkey for the first time. We ate, cried, toasted on my mom’s memory. It was sad but we three had a good time. Several relatives invited us to spend Christmas with them, but we wanted to be alone. Mayra stayed with her parents, and SIL (My brother’s wife) also was out of the city.

By the beginning of 2024 somebody was knocking on my door. It was Jane. I asked, “Is everything all right?”. She pushed me inside and started kissing me. She said, “I accept.” She accepted to have a FWB relationship with me. I reminded her I was still dating Mayra and she said she knew, but she still wants to be with me. I asked what made her change her mind. She told me she tried to date again but it was the same as last time. She compared both dates with me. I asked “What about your therapy?” She said the aim of the therapy is to make her feel good about herself, and she felt great last month when we had sex, including the following days after we met. We had a quickie because I had somewhere to be, also at night I had a date with Mayra, who accepted my relationship with Jane, but she doesn’t want to meet her. So now we have a FWB relationship. That's great, I really like her body, expressions and her conversation.

I’ve been balancing my life with two beauties, my studies, dancing and keyboard lessons, my training, I resumed my therapy with the thanatologist to close some issues I have with my mom. I have a new tattoo, an orchid on my chest next to my heart. It was my mom’s favorite flower. I haven’t given up to the idea of becoming a father, meanwhile I’ll enjoy my relationship with these two extraordinary ladies. I'm ok with my life for now.

I have always been mindful to keep my discussions of my situation to a minimum, to avoid negativity. when i lost my job and had trouble with the current job market, people stopped asking me to hangout. when i had two failed surgeries this year, people stopped asking how i am. now that my health has declined even worse, i have no contacts in my life anymore. they’ve all slowly faded away after pitying my situations and then treated me differently. this is very difficult as a 25 yo woman who desires the sanity of companionship and friends. this feels like a negative feedback loop that is nearly impossible to escape from. when i think about it — if i somehow miraculously had a change of luck, i wouldn’t want to associate with me or people like me either, I’d want to get away from it. i add nothing to the table anymore, i have no network that would entice another person my age to stay in contact with me. my health and career struggles have just compounded onto each other, and now i’m basically a shut in. i was never this way to this degree in my entire life, and it hurts so badly. i’ve also learned that some people i have known through my life aren’t real friends to discard me like this. what is one to do in my situation — or do i just accept a loner life confined to the outskirts of society?

1hfi55s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1hfi55s/aita_for_finally_having_enough/,AITA for finally having enough.,"I had another post up, and deleted in fear, but its story time now. 
I (30f) have spent a majority of my life being a people pleaser, because this was how I was raised. I was raised to not talk back, not to interrupt someone if they are busy,  to clean up after my stepdad and brother, my mom would clean up after herself, and to never say no when asked to do something(i.e chores), if I  disobeyed, id be yelled at, sent to my room, or both. Ive always been a second thought or the last one. I thought my childhood was normal, I've had struggles in my adulthood and truly have had no help other than my partner. When I was 19 I had saved up almost 9,000, I was saving, i wasn't sure what I was saving for yet, a house, a car, I was just saving. First my mother started her manipulations, crying that if she doesn't give 2,000 they were going to lose the house and have no where to live, sob story, I helped. We'll then my stepfather started with his manipulation, if he doesnt get rent and phone paid he shop will be locked and his business will be shut down, sob story, I helped. My savings in a year went from 9,000 to under 1,000 and they were still asking for money when I was now struggling to pay my own bills, and thats when I stopped. I know giving them the money (they promised to pay back and never did) was my fault, but i feel i did it because of how they raised me as well, if I said no, id be rude and greedy. Jump to the  year I met my, now fiance, was the same year I was sexually assaulted. I was 24 when this happened, when I told my mother about what happened she half laughed. I took this man's daughter(9yrs at the time) down to the beach swimming, he showed up with his son(1yrs at the time) This man was a friend of the family, when swimming he groped me asked if that was okay, I told him no and left the water to play with his dauther in the sand, he followed me with his son and continued to stroke my upper leg, i removed myself further by sitting on the dock, when we got back the house this man made one last attack, he waited by the stairs and let everyone go infront of him, i didnt notice until he waved me by him, i hesitate, but climbed the stairs because his gf was 4 steps infront of me along with my mother, and his daughter, when i took my second step, when my legs were stretched he reached in, he did not go for my butt that time, this man used his children so I would not reacted and went for a third because they thought he got away with one and two. Later this man was sent to a room where I was alone to ""apologize"" further putting my in a uncomfortable situation. I never felt I had the support, and I felt if I went to the police my parents would be mad I did that to their friend, plus he was helping them put walls up so they would also lose their free labor. His gf found out what he did and confronted him, he admitted to it and lied and said he apologized for touching me. Yes he apologized, but when he came to apologize that night, he said for IF he made me feel uncomfortable because that WASN'T his intentions...so to me that was not a proper apology if there even is one for what he did. His gf told me she was concerned for her daughter, and felt bad because she knew of the little things he was doing. Whatever the little things are, i honestly did not ask. When he was no longer useful to my parents and owed them money he did not come around anymore. Only recently has this man popped up again. I guess his father is sick and reached out to my parents, they have welcomed him and his gf(i call her his supporter) with open arms. Since being with my fiance I have gathered a bit of a back bone. When I found out my parents were friends with them again I questioned them and I told them I thought it was disgusting for them to be friends with those people again and how I'm still healing from what he did, and how they can sit there sharing coffee with my attacker and his supporter. My mom lost her mind, she started with how she was nothing but supportive, how she took me to see a lawyer(this never happened, she literally made this up) and how his gf never touched me and she can be friends with her. She even threw in how she's dealing with her dying mother (my grandmother, she has dementia)and didn't need the stress, she was just trying to make herself look like a victim because anytime there is any conflict that's her playing card, and I wasn't going to be manipulation, so I told her she was not the victim in this situation, to which I got a sarcastic ""no, no you're right, you are the victim"" from her. She also told me if I made a public post it would be the last thing I do...I haven't spoken to her in almost two months, she's been telling anyone that will listen that I'm this giant Ahole and I feel like people are believing her because I am her daughter. I've been keeping to myself, I tried reaching out to a few family members only to be ignored so I can only imagine what is being said. I do have screenshot of some proof if needed but I really don't want to have to share it on my social media, I feel if I do and I stand up for myself I will only cause more drama or give her more fuel for hers.

1hfi3nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hfi3nn/stuck_in_a_selfdug_well/,Stuck in a self-dug well. ,"Hi everyone, this is my first Reddit post and not one that I would have thought of posting, but I need some ""brutal honesty"" from strangers on the internet. I am using this as a way of getting stuff out of my system. Therapy has been recommended for me, but I am not a strong believer that it would help me personally; I have tried it and still does not work. Disclaimer, this will most likely be a long a read, just me venting and seeking advice, but I understand if you do not want to read the whole thing. Regardless, thank you for making it this far. :)

Basically, as the title reads, I am currently in stuck in a self-dug well. My girlfriend and I were together for over two years, starting out as a long distance relationship where I had to drive 5+ hours every weekend after work for us to spend some quality time in person, rather than just having a virtual relationship. A few months later or so, I had the opportunity to move in to the same city she was living at, and I took it and the relationship flourished even more though so, to the point where I was telling my parents I was going to marry this girl, not even after one year of dating. Everything was perfect. This was not my first relationship, but it was the one that made me understand the true meaning of love. 

However, it was towards the end of last year that things began to get rocky for me. Unfortunately, she does not come from the best ""economic"" position, so to speak. She had (and still has) to work full-time in order to pay her rent and most importantly, her college education. I always told her how much I admired her for this, because I know that I myself would not have been able to do what she does, but still this was not enough; she tends to compare herself with others and that creates a sort of ""black cloud"" over her head. I am not trying to criticize her for this, as I did all I could to be a support system for her, but it got to the point where her anger at her situation was redirected towards me, unconsciously of course, but it still starting to pay a toll on my mental health, because I did not have the heart to tell her that she was starting to bring me down, when all I did was try to support her, both financially (to the best of my abilities) and emotionally. Long story short, I travelled back home for Christmas break, had my first and only therapy session, and when I got back decided that it was best for me to break things off. Hence why I hate therapy, even though it was not the therapist who told me to break things off, it was me. 

No contact whatsoever was made between us the first two months of the breakup (start of 2024). I even started talking to another girl, just to try to get over the breakup, which I myself admit that it was not the smartest thing to do, but I am still a young, dumb person. I am human too. Fast-forward towards the end of February, it was my birthday and my ex texted me what I could consider to be the most beautiful, heart-felt message anyone has ever texted me. I decided to ask her out for a coffee and a few ""coffee dates"" later, we decided to get back together. This time for good, or so I thought. 

Following months were GREAT, I really thought you know, this was it. This is my life partner, my future wife, mother of my kids. We tackled the issues we had on ""part one"" of our relationship, which was mainly communication, and everything seemed perfect. That was until I started a new job in July. My availability to spend time with her during weekdays became more complicated, and it was clearly affecting her. If I look back at everything, I became increasingly tired. Just a little disclaimer, I am in a position where I need a company to sponsor me in order to be able to get a work visa, so I entered this job with the mentality that I needed to prove that I was the best and worth sponsoring, but did not realize that would take such a heavy price in my energy. 

With this, discussions increased again, communication hit an all-time low (similar to the end of 2023), and this time I had little to no energy to be an active participant in fixing things, which was a critical mistake. In October, I had a destination wedding in Europe, and she could not come with me. She was bummed out, but as I mentioned before, she could not travel because of work/education, and I was still not in a financial position to pay all of her travel expenses plus the rent she owed. I must admit, I had a blast at the wedding, saw family members I had not seen in years, and even met new people (this will be important later). It was so fun that we even started planning out our next ""cousin trip"" for 2025. 

I get back from the trip, and my ex and I had a sit down where she told me that she thought she ""loved me more than I loved her"" and that she was not happy with how the relationship was turning out. This broke me. This was the first time she saw me cry and to this day, I do not know why it affected me so much, but something changed in me that day. The following weeks, I was performing an Oscar-worthy acting where I faked a smile and tried letting time fix our relationship, but that conversation and her telling me everything she told me broke me. Maybe insecurities, I am not sure what it was. I was not happy, but I still wanted to salvage the relationship. However, one week prior to the breakup, I got an Instagram follow request from one of the people I met at the wedding trip (a girl, obviously). We reminisced over the trip, how fun it was (even how close she was to hooking up with one of cousins), and I made the idiotic mistake of asking for her number to create a groupchat with my cousins to plan the 2025 trip. Now, something I have not mentioned before is that my ex was of the jealous type, mostly due to some trauma that she lived in her past (not caused by myself). I always tried to heal that trauma, but I do not think I ever got close, and I should have been smarter than asking another girl for her number, even if it was not with flirtatious intent. I want to make clear that there was no flirting or cheating, but I did not have the courage to tell my ex about this new girl because I knew what her reaction would be, and I was scared (I am a coward, I know). 

You may have guessed it by now, she saw the contact of the girl (who she had never met or seen) and called me out on it. I have never felt like such a POS in my life before, but I truly was the biggest POS and I will never forgive myself for that because the way I saw how broken my ex was is an image I will not be able to get out of my head. I told her and showed her everything, it was nothing more than just a normal conversation, but she still could not trust me. And this is where I realized that there was no going back from this, that by my own hand I had lost all the trust my ex had in me, just by asking for a number and entertaining a conversation that should not have been me, but my cousin who wanted the girl at the trip. We broke up two weeks ago. 

These two weeks have been hell. I have had everyone in my life ask me how I am and with my Oscar-worthy performance, I say I am fine. But I am not. That girl was and is the love of my life, and I know that I will never find another love like that. I had never met someone like her, someone who loved me with that much passion. Regardless of her flaws, because she does have flaws just like I do and you do too, I should have done more rather than just give up, twice now. I am broken and I think I will be broken for the rest of my life. I do not want to start over, but I do not have it in me to ask her for a ""round 3"", it is too late for that. 

If you made it this far, thank you and I apologize for the long read. I just needed to get it out of my system. I am not looking for any sympathy, because I do not deserve it. I am just looking for honesty from strangers, who do not know me and do not need to sugar coat things. 

And to my ex, who I know is not a Redditor and will not read this, I love you and I am sorry for hurting you.  ",1,1734352455.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I recently took a Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas, and I just had to share my experience with you all. It was honestly one of the best day trips I've ever done, and I want to help you plan yours.

I researched a ton of options before booking, but ultimately went with this tour (https://athometouch.com/SouthRim) because it offered the best value for money. At $80, it's pretty reasonable considering everything that's included.

The day started early - they picked me up from my hotel around 6 AM. Pro tip: grab a coffee and maybe pack some snacks! The bus was super comfortable with AC and a bathroom, which is crucial for the 14-hour journey. Our driver/guide Mike was hilarious and kept us entertained with interesting facts about the desert landscape and local history.

We made a quick stop in Kingman, Arizona (ya know, from Route 66!) to stretch our legs and grab some snacks. But the real magic started when we reached the South Rim. Let me tell you - pictures don't do this place justice. It's mind-blowing how massive and colorful the canyon is in person.

We visited multiple viewpoints, including Mather Point and Bright Angel Point. Each spot offers a completely different perspective of the canyon. The meal voucher came in handy for lunch, and I had time to explore the National Geographic Visitor Center too.

Here's what made this tour worth it for me:
- No stress about driving or navigation
- Knowledgeable guide who knew all the best photo spots
- Comfortable transportation
- All entrance fees included
- Convenient hotel pickup/drop-off

They also offer some cool upgrades like an IMAX movie experience, a Hummer tour along the rim (which looked awesome), and helicopter flights over the canyon. I didn't opt for these, but several people in my group did and loved it.

If you're planning to book this tour (which you definitely should), here's the link again: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim. Book in advance though - these tours fill up fast, especially during peak season!

Quick tips:
- Wear comfortable shoes
- Bring a water bottle
- Don't forget your camera
- Layer your clothing (it can get chilly at the rim)
- Sit on the right side of the bus for the best views

Has anyone else done this tour? Would love to hear about your experiences in the comments!

P.S. This was totally worth getting up early for. The sunset views on the way back to Vegas were an unexpected bonus!",1,1734351927.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

I was talking with my husband yesterday about how I wish someone had shown me the no cost/minimal cost swaps we have made now when I was starting out. When you approach the zero-waste online spaces - which is where a lot of people start out - there can be gate-keeping, and a lot of high cost to entry issues. Visit your local zero-waste store if you don't know what I mean. So anyway, here are the top swaps we've made in our house to be more mindful consumer that have actually saved us money! 

1. Re-usable coffee filters. I didn't even know these existed! We have cotton coffee filters that we rinse out each day and hang to dry, boil them once a month. They work exactly the same and will probably last for years and year. Now I don't have to buy coffee filters. 

2. Stop using paper towels. I literally just stopped buying paper towels and forced my family to get used to using dish rags instead. Small adjustment period, and now we don't even miss them! No more +$20 each grocery trip! 

3. Cotton crocheted dish rag instead as a re-usable sponge. The environmentally friendly re-usable sponges are just..... gross. Sorry! I hate how they're so hard to clean! I learned exactly 1 crochet stitch and started making dish rags out of cotton yarn. They're the perfect size, they get suzy like a sponge, clean great, and you can just throw them right into the washing machine! They come out looking brand new. Plus 1 ball of yarn makes you quite a few so very cost effective for something that will last a super long time. 

4. Ceramic baking sheets & silicone baking mats instead of parchment paper and aluminum foil. 

5. Learning to make easy foods, like salad dressing, pancake mix, yogurt, and honey mustard (all examples) at home to avoid plastic bottles and also added cost. 

  
I'm sure a lot of you are aware of these options and of course things work differently for everybody. BUT I'm hoping that someone new to this space finds this post and finds them to be actually helpful recommendations :) ",6,1734351562.0,Anticonsumption,13,0.88,False

Thanks to this group I also have a Schwab account for my cash flowing investments. I have been cashing out Vanguard slo-pokes and transferring to Schwab. Early on I set my dividends to NOT reinvest -- directing to settlement fund. The pathway to reallocate is not intuitive and most definitely weighted to reinvesting . . . sometime last year I set the default to point dividends to cash. The page to change or confirm these settings is NOT visible on the phone app.

I purchased an asset in the Vanguard acct (I do want some cash flow there) recently then went traveling. I was looking for my dividend Friday/Saturday (really with them landing on Tuesday) only to find this morning that it was reinvested, which is a pain because we are in year end and I am self employed/passive income.

The hotel recently had a renovation in their lobby, adding in a new bar and café. They are now expecting the receptionists to train up on cocktail making and food service, alongside working the reception. All while remaining on minimum wage. When my partner first started she was told she may have to help serve tea or coffee once in a while, which she agreed to do. But not work as a full barman/waiter. 

This morning she went in for training with the rest of the reception team, and when she asked if they would be getting a pay rise the general manager (an old fart at best) shot her down, belittled her Infront of the other staff, and fired her on the spot for asking. 

Naturally she's lost on what to do, doesn't even want to return back to the hotel to get her Car. 

Also the general practice and treatment of staff is disgusting within the hotel. Standard toxic upper management who are all friends with the owner. They even dragged one of the housekeepers over to the owners dads house recently to clean, like we're they're personal maids.

I said I understand and that I don't want to be jumping into relationship either, but would like to continue to hang out, take things slow and see what happens, and she responded with sorry if it wasn't the answer I was hoping for and to text her when I get home, so I did and said thanks for such a great time and I hope to see her soon.
