Social Media Manager — Lifted Grounds Coffee Co.
At Lifted Grounds Coffee Co.™, we don’t do polished, pretty coffee shop vibes.
We’re built for the mud, the trails, and the ones who live life off-road.

We’re just getting started — brand new and hungry — and we’re looking for a social media manager who’s ready to build with us from the ground up.

What you need to know:

Platforms: TikTok, Instagram, Facebook you need to know them cold.

You’ll handle content creation and posting. I’ll run paid ads to punch it further.

You must understand off-road, outdoor, and rugged culture — not just ""coffee lover"" culture.

I move fast. I’ll feed you ideas, rough concepts, and real content — no waiting around. You need to be ready to grab it and run.

First month: We're going in heavy — multiple posts a day to oversaturate and wake up the algorithm.

After that, we lock into a strong, steady rhythm that keeps the momentum rolling.

This is a long-term ride, not a one-and-done project.

Bonus if you can spot trends, create short-form content that fits the brand, and help us grow without watering it down.

If you’re ready to help build something real:

Send your info

Your rates

Examples of past work that show you get it

If you move slow, flake out, or can’t work without a manual, don’t waste your time or mine.
FYI: I’m not on Reddit much — if you’re serious, you’ll figure out how to reach me.

- It was good initially but then it started fizzing out, I asked we do not have to meet, she insisted she wanted to, but alas it wont go anywhere.

- She loves going to the gym, and fails to understand I am more into playing a sport than going to the gym. It felt like chugging protein powder + gym is what she was looking for, I'm not sure.

- She was atleast an hour late to the meeting, I spent my time buying shoes, when she saw the price of the shoes, she was like you buy such expensive shoes?

- I decided Paul as the restaurant for meeting, but since I was not sure when she's arrive I did not book a table. I even called her to gauge where she was at, but she did not pickup, and I went clothes shopping.

- She herself decided to eat at Cinnabon, refused to eat paneer sandwich as that was the only veg snack they had, I got her the best cinnabon according to the cashier with pecan nuts and coffee and I paid. 

- She complained about Coffee being foamy, I mean, is that not a good thing? She complained about cinnabon being too sweet, I had the same cinnabon, it tasted great.

- I texted her last noght what her feeling was, she left it on read.

- Over the course of 2 weeks, she would go absent and call at 12.50 am and start talking.

- She decided to book a car fixing appointment the day we decided to meet, showing a sheer lack of seriousness. Or a useless excuse to run away quickly. Too many mindgames or stupidity.

- She haggled over time when I told her the mall gets really rushy, and to meet at 12 when its very calm. Later that night she understood why I was saying that.

- She asked me about youtube premium, and she haggled over 150/month being too much for her. Mind you she teaches people how to dance, how is this not a valid investment? 

- Oh and she mentioned she is going out with a friend to get her car repaired at Kashmere gate.

- She also mentioned there was a guy she met at a wedding, and wanted to know if he was manglik or not, while still in talks with me.

The more I think, the more I understand how wrong of a match she is for me. The only thing she did seriously until now was be good at calls or texting, apart from a couple instances.

**Part Nine**

The mirror is still fogged up from the shower. I can only see the shape of me, but I can’t see any details. I trace my finger along the surface and I write a word with a shaking finger.

SIMP

I keep hearing the two people I love most in the world in my head. They’re telling me to wake up. They’re telling me to trust them, that they’re both older and wiser than I am and that I don’t know enough to make a sound judgement about how I’m feeling.

*They’re not like us, Aaron.* 

I don’t think that’s true.

*If they weren't behind that wall and controlled, you would see them for what they really are.* 

But I can see them for what they are now. I can see what we do to them.

*Everything we have and everything we are depends on them being monitored, controlled, and ultimately disposed of when they’ve outlived their usefulness.*

Maybe we shouldn’t have those things if this is what it takes to get them.

*You can’t think of them as human. They’re nothing like us. You make that mistake and it’ll drive you nuts.*

Too late.



I stare at the word long enough to watch the letters sag and run downward leaving clear dripping lines through the fog, and when they’re completely unrecognizable, all that’s left is the young man who was standing behind the fog.

A young man who is unrecognizable to me. 

I’m losing my grip. I can’t hold it all together. It’s like walking a mile with an armful of sand and trying not to drop a single grain.

The man I’m staring at in the mirror isn’t who I was last week. His eyes are different. Wide and bloodshot, but dead. I had the benefit of never having them opened to anything outside of what I already knew and now that they’re opened I’ll never be able to close them again. Maybe that’s why I can’t stay asleep. 

What’s wrong with me? 

I close my eyes and I search in vain for the wonderful ignorance I’ve lost. For just a moment, I think I found it somewhere in the dark and my body sways in the sweetness of it, but then I feel a sharp pain in my forehead and my eyes open again.

There’s two drops of blood in my perfect white sink and a shard from the mirror. I fell asleep. Luckily my forehead hit the mirror hard enough to wake me up before I fell and broke my jaw on the sink.

Three hours of sleep. Not much but it's an improvement from yesterday. By the time I tend to the cut on my forehead and put my suit on, I want to go back to bed. I can’t do this.

I’ve lived under a flimsy rationalization my whole life that keeping those people within the wall and dictating every area of their life was good for them and for us but now I’ve seen it with my eyes in all of its naked cruelty. I can’t continue to rationalize it anymore.

I can’t be the only one.

Am I?

I look at myself one more time in the broken mirror.

“This isn’t you. You can’t be a part of this.”

\-

I still let myself into my mother’s apartment as if I still live there. I think nothing of it when I turn the knob and I continue to think nothing of it while I call out for her. 

I love my mother. She may be oblivious, maybe even willfully ignorant, but I’ve never known her to be cruel. Has she even seen what happens to these people behind the wall she built? She’s not unreasonable. She’s my mother.

“Mom? Mom?! I need…”

I stop speaking when I walk into the front room. Tommy’s mother is with her and they’re sitting on the couch just looking at me.

“Aaron? Honey? Are you alright? You look worse than yesterday.” I look back and forth between them. Tommy’s mother is probably one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen, even if she is somewhere in her fifties, but she is one of the coldest people I’ve ever met. Nothing like her son. I can’t talk to my mother in front of her.

“I’m… yes. I didn't get any sleep again. I just was…” Don’t do it now Aaron. Do it in private. “ I was wondering if I could have some coffee before I go out the door?”

“Of course. There should be a little left.”

“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt anything. Good morning, Alice.”

“Good morning Aaron. Congratulations, I understand that you’re doing very well in your first few days. Thomas is quite proud of you.”

“Thank you.” I walk over to the carafe and pour the meagre amount of coffee that’s left into a cup and gulp it down. My mother picks the conversation back up with Alice.

“Well of course none of us expected them to breed at quite the rate we’re seeing. It’s impossible to predict everything perfectly.”

“Well we have a few ideas to mitigate the issue. Expanding the Exceptional Protocol to include a specified number of children at random, introducing agents into the food supply that targets specific traits that are less than desirable than others, and also…” Alice stops talking and stares at me. “Was there something else, Aaron?”

“No.” 

My mother turns back to me.

“Aaron, I’m in the middle of something. Is there something else you need?” I search my mother’s face and find no cruelty in it. There’s just nothing. That’s somehow worse. 

“No.”

“Are you sure?”

“No, Mom. Thank you for the coffee. I better go.”

I let myself out the door. Has it always been this out in the open? Have I purposely ignored all of it? Is it possible that I’ve kept my eyes closed on purpose?

*Have you done that poor man the courtesy of witnessing what you’ve done to him, or is he still hanging in the air? Is his death still a tile sitting in the corner of your monitor that you can keep ignoring? How long can you keep your eyes closed, Aaron?*

\-

 Maybe if I were placed somewhere else, somewhere where I didn’t have to look at what happens behind that wall, I could at least gather my thoughts long enough to continue to justify everything.

*Justify it? You watched a man have his feet chopped off at the ankles. He was left there to bleed out, a message to everyone about what they’re worth.*

I have to talk to Tommy. I need to get out of Department 49.

Everyone on the tram is trying not to look at me. None of them look like the mess that is me. My shirt has several coffee stains on it and I can already feel that my back is soaked with sweat underneath my jacket.

I’m the last person off the tram and I walk slowly enough to make sure that everyone else files inside City Hall long before I finally walk past the two Bishops and through the front doors. There’s only one person left inside the hall as I walk in. Simon.

He’s standing next to the door to Department 49 with his arms crossed. He’s smiling at me. I’m not going in there. I think he knows that.

“Morning, Kid.”

“Morning.”

*Just walk past him Aaron. Who cares what he thinks? He doesn’t like you anyway.*

I slow down as I get near the door but my eyes go down the hall. The control room is further down. Tommy will be in there already.

“Are you coming in?” I hate Simon’s smile.

“I’ll be right back.” I walk past him, but he doesn’t move.

“I wondered how many days it was going to take you to break. I had you pegged the second I saw you. Where are you going? Are you going to run to big brother to beg him to put you somewhere else?” He’s laughing and I start to walk a little faster. The door to the control room is almost to the very end of the hall. As I get closer, I can see the beginning of a grand marble staircase that descends into the lower level. Two Bishops stand on either side of it. When I finally reach the door, I turn and see Simon still standing next to the door to Department 49. He hasn’t moved. He hasn’t stopped smiling.

I don’t care.

I open the door and go inside.

The back wall is nothing but dozens of monitors showing different views of the city streets behind the wall. There are several stations of technicians on headsets. The atmosphere in this room is quite different from Department 49. Colder. More Impersonal. I expect to see Tommy directing the goings on, but instead I find his grandfather.

A surly old man who has been confined to a wheelchair at least as long as I’ve been alive. He’s always scared me with his piercing rodent-like eyes and a deeply furrowed brow. I had never seen the man show any other emotions beyond exasperation and disappointment. The tiny motors in his chair whine as he turns to face me.

“What are you doing here?”

“I’m sorry sir, I was looking for… Thomas.”

“He’s unavailable today.”

“Alright.” I hesitate for a moment, thinking of what comes next and it's just long enough to try the old man’s patience.

“You’re training on the middle shift, are you not?”

“Yes sir.”

“Then why are you still standing there? Leave.”

“Yes sir.”

I turn and walk back out of the door and I see that Simon is still standing in the hall.

I feel like I don’t have a choice. My two lifelines are offline. I’m stuck.

My heart begins to race as I pass Simon and walk into Department 49. 

\-

Simon already had a huge cup of coffee waiting for me at my station, and I take two gulps that burn their way down my throat. It’s much stronger than the stuff my mother makes. He hands me my headset.

“You know… it really pissed me off when you broke my record a couple of days ago. Some snot-nosed kid who just comes in here from The Tower and… you just broke it like it was nothing.”

“I’m sorry.” I want to hit him. Maybe if I go ahead and do it, they’ll send me home.

“Then I started thinking, why am I so angry? I’m in charge of you for now, so, why not make the most of it.”

“What do you mean?”

“I think I’ve figured you out. After we left yesterday, I realized what you did to me at the end of the day. You got me talking about something I enjoyed so you wouldn’t have to do your job. That was really good.”

“No, I…”

“It’s my fault. Anybody can be manipulated, even me, but it won’t happen again. But I kept asking myself why didn’t you want to do your job, and then I figured that out too. So we’re going to change things up a little bit today.” He smiles and I see little bits of his breakfast that are still stuck between his dirty teeth. “I want you to watch something. One more video and then we’ll go over what’s going to happen today. Put your headset on.”

Simon opens a video and it shows an empty dark street in front of a large building. The street lights are on and the rain is pouring down so hard, I have to turn the volume down on my headset.

For a while, I see nothing but the rain until I see something that makes my eyes twitch. The Painted Bishop walks into the frame and stands in front of the building. I can see his hammer tucked into the back of his belt. He’s not wearing a coat, just the tattered robe and he’s barefoot. He considers something about the building and then, he begins to climb it. Simon isn’t watching the screen, he’s watching me.

His voice is a whisper. He’s trying to get to me.

“He’s a fuckin’ monster. Straight up the almost sheer side of a concrete building. Any other Bishop would just walk inside, but he’s different. He likes what he does. He’s like me. He really enjoys his work.”

“Simon, I don’t want to watch this.”

“Too bad, Kid. This is part of your job. Watch the fuckin’ screen.” 

The camera moves up, keeping the Bishop in frame. I watch him scale the front of the building wondering how he’s even able to climb something that fast. The camera moves up as far as it can, and the Bishop gets smaller and smaller on the screen.

“Seventy floors. No rope and in the rain. Nothing ever stops him. Nothing ever scares him.” The Bishop stops climbing. He pulls the hammer out of his belt and smashes it against a window and then he disappears inside the broken frame. Simon reaches forward and speeds up the video. 

I start to stand up and he grabs my hand and pulls me back down.

“Now… Here’s what I figured out. You’ve got some misguided feelings for the Simps. That’s a huge fuckin’ irony considering the people you come from. Just think about what would be said I had to report a sympathy violation against the golden boy son of two of the Founders? I’m sure that big brother would be able to make it go away, but still, that’s really embarrassing to people like you. I’d make sure word got around.” I’m starting to get angry. I grit my teeth and he licks his. He’s clearly not intimidated.

“Simon…”

“I don’t think that thought is going to be enough to motivate you though, so that’s why you’re watching this.”

Before I can say another thing, I hear a young girl scream in my headset. My eyes go back to the screen. The camera has moved back down to street level. The Painted Bishop walks out of the front door with a struggling young girl over his shoulder. A few people also come out from the building behind him and they watch as he throws the girl down to the ground. He smashes his hammer against her knees, and I gag at the sound of it.

“Oh, you haven’t seen anything yet.”

“What did she do?”

“And there you go. Asking questions like that. Who cares? The system found her guilty of something. It doesn’t matter.”

A young man runs out of the building while the Bishop begins to tie the rope around the young girl's wrists. The young man throws himself into the Bishop’s back.

“Remember when I said, no one comes forward? You’re about to see why that is.”

The young man tries his best to fight the Bishop and save the girl, but it’s no use. The Bishop is fast. It’s like he knows every punch that the man is going to throw and he has a counter already planned. He toys with the young man before he finally pulls his hammer. He catches one of the young man’s wrists and brings the sharp end of his hammer down until the bones shatter and the flesh rips.

The young man stumbles backward as the Bishop throws the arm to the ground. I close my eyes and Simon starts snapping his fingers.

“Open them. I’m making a point.” 

I watch the monster hack the young man’s limbs off and then he takes the rope from the girl’s wrists and instead wraps it around the young man’s neck. He pulls the bleeding torso into the air and hangs it from the street lamp. 

The Bishop takes a step back and I hear that awful voice again. Amazingly, the young man is barely alive. I see his face. It’s covered in burn scars.

“Boy, you stood in the way of Consensus! You stood in the way of what is just!” People in the building look out of their windows as the Bishop speaks. “See now that you have achieved nothing!” 

The Bishop turns and grabs the young woman by her hair and smashes his hammer into her face. 

“Hey! Open your eyes Kid!”

“Fuck you, Simon. Turn it off.”

“And that is why no one ever comes forward.”

He laughs and turns the video off. I can feel my heart beating behind my eyeballs when I open them.

“So I was right, you feel sorry for these fuckers. That’s good. That’s something I can work with. You manipulated me yesterday, and now I have my turn.”

“You’re sick.”

“Maybe. There’s a reason I showed you this, ya know. I’ve heard instances of people feeling for the simps. Honestly, I have no idea why, but I know every single one of those people gets over it eventually. But I don’t have that kind of time because it’s my job to train you. Once the training is over, if you’ve still got those feelings, that’s something on you. But right now, your ass is mine and I’ve got a job to do and I’m not going to have you make me look bad anymore. I’ve already gone over today's plan with Norman and he’s given me the go ahead, so there’s no one for you to run and tattle to. 

So here’s the plan today, Kid. You’re going to take every call you can and I’m giving you a five minute time limit on each of them. You don’t do your best to convince them to off themselves, I disconnect after five minutes and they will all be referred to the Bishops, and I will make you watch every single one of them become an Example. So you get to choose. They end themselves peacefully or there’s going to be a whole lot of Bishop’s business today.”

“Simon, I’m exhausted and I can’t…”

“Too bad.”

He clicks over and I have someone on the line. He puts his hands up and smiles, then he starts a countdown on his monitor.

4:59

4:58

4:57

I feel like I can’t catch my breath. I’m sweating through my shirt. I hear the voice in my headset.

“Consensus? Are you back? Hello, Consensus?” I read the information in front of me. A fourteen year old girl who has fallen behind in her productivity in school. Two instances of suicidal ideation related to severe depression. I take another drink of the coffee and then I begin.

4:42

4:41

“Hello Kyra, I’m so sorry for…”

CLICK

The call goes dead and I realize that Simon has disconnected it on purpose. 

“Why did you do that?!”

“Because I want you to take this seriously, and I want you to know that I’m not bluffing. That little bitch simp is about to have a really painful day. How many more is up to you. Now get to it. I’ll keep you coffee’d up. I don’t want you leaving this seat all day.

\-

My heart is beating in time with every countdown that starts on Simon’s monitor. Voice after voice of people with no hope. My head spins with the thought of these people hanging from ropes, chopped to pieces, or worse and the only thing that keeps it clear are the poisonous words that I force out of my mouth. I spew things into this world that I’m ashamed of. I say things that would have ended me when I was thirteen. I say some of the same things that my father said to me. Some of them simply need permission, while others need the final push.

I give them both.

Simon stays good to his word. The coffee flows and it keeps my eyes open, everytime the five minutes is up I hear a click and it keeps me focused. After each call that seems successful, I watch him log into the biomarkers and place them on a twenty four hour hold. Simon said the biomarkers that have been implanted into each of them are temperature sensitive. Once a body goes cold, the biomarker logs them out of the system. The Reduction is complete.

If they don’t go cold within the twenty four hour period the Reduction is referred to a Bishop. He’s disconnected three people by the time we’re ready to break for lunch. Three people that are going to die painful deaths tonight.

Simon stands up and stretches while I take the headset off and I run my hand through sweaty hair. My arms are shaking.

“What do you think you’re doing?”

“Are we taking a break?”

“I am. You’re going to stick with it. You’ve got thirty minutes without a five minute time limit, but I still expect you to work. I’ll bring you back some food.” He leaves along with everyone else. Norman is the last one to walk for the door. He's trying not to look at me.

“Norman? Norman?!”

‘What is it Aaron?”

“Norman, I’m exhausted. I really need a break…”

“Aaron… Simon went over his concerns with me and I hate to tell you this, but I agree with him. A sympathy violation is something I take very seriously. It’s not a good look.” He scratches at his head and looks around the room. “In all honesty, I was just like you when I started. I had a violation in my first week, but I’ve never had one since. These problems you’re having… the only way to get over them is to throw yourself into the work. Trust the process. You’re gonna do great!” He slaps me on the shoulder and gives me a thumbs up before he leaves.

I sit in the room by myself and a call tile pops up on my monitor. Francine. Aged sixty four.

I’ve felt forced to do what I’ve done all day. How can I do this on my own?

Click

“Hello Francine, I’m sorry to have kept you waiting.” 

“I don’t care.”

“What seems to be the problem?”

“I’m finished. I don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t want this life anymore.” I can hear the determination in her voice.

“Why are you feeling this way?”

“Life was better before you. I never should have agreed to put myself in this prison and today I’m going to take myself out of it. My eyes are finally open. There’s no going back.”

Click

I look around the quiet room while several calls pop up on my monitor. I’m not answering anymore. I grab the coffee cup and sip the cold stuff down. I’ve had at least five cups. My hands are shaking worse and worse and the only time they’re even slightly still is when they’re moving over my keyboard.

I don’t care what Simon says, I’m stopping for a moment. I need to do something. 

I open the tile from my first Reduction. Shawn is still suspended in the air over the crowd of people.

I need to see it.

I let the video play and I finally let the man rest in my mind. I finally see what I’ve done. Four other people are killed as he falls on them. Hearing it is almost worse than seeing it. A mother screams for her child that was killed.

My eyes are finally open. There’s no going back.

I slowly reverse the footage frame by frame, and I pretend that I’m correcting what I’ve done. Helping these people instead of killing them. 

Shawn’s body comes back together and flies backward. The three people and the child get back up and Shawn’s body gently floats upwards and upwards and back through the window. All the broken pieces of glass come back together and the window is whole again. The man I killed is safe back inside of his apartment. I close my eyes and think of what I would have said to him to keep him from taking his own life.

I think of what Tommy told me when I thought I was finished.

*“There’s ALWAYS one thing, Aaron. One thing that can keep you going. Always. The trick is to find it. And then you can move forward.”* 

For just a moment, I feel like myself again, but I know as soon as Simon comes back that the nightmare will continue.

A call tile pops up on my screen.

What am I supposed to do?

How am I supposed to keep going on like this and just do nothing?

*Then do something.* 

*Find the one thing.*

My best friend from childhood passed away in an accident. This was very hard on me. I was really sad and felt so guilty because I had not spoken to him or replied to his texts the prior 3 months because my boyfriend told me I wasn’t allowed to talk to any other men- even my old friends. I left Brazil for the funeral and my boyfriend was hurt that I left because his family lives in Brazil and I was supposed to be staying there to be with them. But I had to go. I remember feeling like my boyfriend didn’t seem to understand how bad this was- losing my friend. I remember feeling very alone at this time and hurting a lot from losing my friend. Anyway, my boyfriend and I got into a lot of fights while he was in Brazil and I was home. I remember telling him how I felt like he didn’t care for me etc. He told me he was trying to enjoy his time with his family which I get because he rarely gets to see them. But we ended up just having a lot of tension and in the thick of my emotional pain from that I ended up threatening to break up. We threatened this a lot but never seriously. I remember he actually agreed this time. I told him no- that I was just mad and figured like sual we would just get through it. But this time was different. He actually called me and told me basically that he wasn’t sure how we would work etc and how he wanted his kids to be with his family in Brazil one day.This rocked my world. I have never been in such pain. I couldn’t eat. I lost 15 pounds and would not be able to sleep. It was honestly the lowest I had ever been in fear of losing him. We ended up being okay, but I had so much fear now. Prior to this I thought we were getting engaged that summer. I thought he was going to propose. Then this, where he wanted to break up. He would tell me how he didn’t but for the first time I wasn’t truly sure if he wanted me. He came back to the states and things were really weird. I remember feeling so bad as I had so much fear he would leave me. I was sad that we weren’t engaged yet too. Then when we went back to college (we go to different colleges) things were still very weird. It was like I wasn’t secure in knowing he wanted me. This made me feel so anxious and freaked out. I felt like I was annoying him being like this. Then on top of this, this was my senior year if college and things were very different on campus. My best friend and old roommate moved off campus and I rarely saw her. My sister who was my current roommate was dating someone on campus and therefore was always with this boyfriend. A lot of my close friends graduated. I felt so insanely alone. I remember eating all alone in my dorm everyday. I felt like a weirdo, a loner, like there was something wrong with me. I had lost my best friend in the car accident and truly just felt like I had no friends to hangout with. I had my boyfriend to text and call but no one on campus to be with. I have always had issues with worrying about how I appear to the world. I didn’t want to be seen as some girl with no social circle- no friends. So I decided to try to make some friends. I would pray to God to help me make friends. Still nothing- all the girls on campus seemed to have a social circle already. After all, I was a senior and no longer seen as someone who needed to get involved with small groups to make friends. I remember trying so hard to talk to people, but nothing would stick. I’m a relatively quiet person, who has always kinda relied on other people to engage with me to become my friend. So it was weird for me to try to make friends. I remember one day I was walking to class when some guy that I had seen before introduced himself. He just asked my name and major- the typical stuff people do. Then later that day I saw he added me on Instagram. I accepted this, thinking it was “interesting”. This might sound weird but with men I have always kinda assumed when they do this they have a crush or something, but I also go to a Christian college so I was like “maybe he’s just friendly”. Anyways, time passed and then one day I posted an Instagram story about a Starbucks drink. Like which one was better and people could vote. I remember he commented saying that neither and that Dunkin was better. I remember being happy that he commented because that meant he was like paying attention to me and remembered me. We started a conversation as I told him that Starbucks was way better. He told me that he had never had Starbucks so I told him we had to go then so he could taste how much better it was than Dunkin. I remember being excited thinking this was my chance to make a friend. I have always had an easier time making friends with men than women. Men are easier to make friends with. Usually if they think you’re cute they will want to be your friend. I figured this was the situation with him. That he probably had a crush on me and that’s why he was talking to me. I thought it was interesting though because on my instagram i have tons of pictures with my boyfriend of us kissing etc. So I wasn’t sure what his intentions were because he clearly saw I had a man. Then I remember that the next day I was going home for the weekend. I deleted the messages and didn’t text him that weekend because I didn’t want my boyfriend to see and be mad saying I couldn’t talk to him. My boyfriend doesn’t want me to have guy friends and has gotten mad in the past if I texted any guy remotely. Then I got back that week and texted this guy again. He just asked how my weekend was etc. I was excited to have a friend on campus that I could hangout with maybe. Someone that would do things with me so I wasn’t alone. I was hoping he would want to be my friend. I then remember texting him and he asked me what I was up to. I just told him I was bored and studying. He asked if I wanted to study with him. I said sure and went to meet him. I remember getting ready to see him and I put some makeup on because I didn’t want him to think I was ugly and gross and not want to be my friend. I then met with him and we studied. He asked me how my summer was and then I told him how it was awful because of losing my best friend. Then I said how it was awful after that too because of everything with my boyfriend. I think I told him this partially because it was the truth, partially because I wanted him to know I had a boyfriend, ad partially a little subconsciously because I wanted him to want to be my friend and thought maybe he would be more inclined in case he kinda liked me and thought my boyfriend and I were having issues. I didn’t know if he liked me or not (like had a crush) but I just know a lot of my past guy friends secretly had a crush on me as they would admit it later and this was why they wanted to be my friend. I think that’s why i was like “well I really want a friend so even if it’s just a guy being my friend because he secretly has a crush at least I get a friend, I don’t care his intentions as long as I get a friend”. I knew that I didn’t find him attractive and would never want to date him so I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend for him or ever cross a boundary in my mind that would be cheating such as flirting or anything physical. So I was like “if he kinda has a crush maybe he will want to be my friend more, I can just make sure I never reciprocate that crush and it’s fine”. So then he just kinda told me that he was sorry and I was kinda crying without wanting to but talking about all that made me feel emotional. I felt stupid for being so vulnerable but it was just a very hard thing in my life talking about summer as it was awful and traumatic for me. Then he gave me a hug goodbye I think because he felt bad for me for crying. Anyways he texted me and I apologized for crying and breaking down to him when he barely knew me. He said it was fine and he was glad to be there to try to listen. I remember thinking how he is a Christian and was probably just being nice and felt bad for me. Then days later he saw me getting coffee on campus and started talking to me. I remember being happy because I had someone to drink coffee with on campus. We talked about random things, I told him about one of my girl friends that he could talk to. He told me about his family etc. He then told me about his celebrity crushes as I asked him what his type was to convince him to like my friend. He then asked me mine. I told him some and I wondered if he was doing this because he liked me or what. I just made sure I didn’t flirt with him in the conversation. Then I asked him if he wanted to get Starbucks after class. He said sure that he would pick me up. On the way there he just talked about random things like where he was from. He then asked how my boyfriend and I were doing. I told him about some of my concerns. When I reflect I think once again I knew telling him this would possibly make him hope we would break up so he could have a chance, but I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend, so I didn’t think it was wrong. I enjoyed having someone listen to me and give me their attention and feel like they cared for me. I would always tell him some issues and follow it up with “but I love him and can’t let him go”. Because these were true concerns. I just kinda got a little dramatic with them acting like these concerns were more serious to me that they really were because I knew I wanted to be with my man and marry him. I lowkey remember thinking about how part of the reason I had anger with my boyfriend was because I just wanted him to propose already because I just wanted to marry him already. I never questioned if I wanted to be with my boyfriend or not at this time. Anyways, I once again brought up my girl friend to him to make sure he saw that I was setting him up with someone. I tried to see how he responded with this to see if he denied her indicating he liked me. But he said he liked her. I remember being a little worried that if they started dating though that I would be in the same situation I was in before where he would go hangout with her all the time like my sister with her boyfriend and I would be all alone again with no friends to hangout with. This made me feel sad like I didn't want him to date her then. Not because I wanted to date him, but because if he dated someone then I would not have anyone to hangout with agan. He paid for my coffee which I felt was a little weird but my old guy friend used to do that too. I remember sitting drinking coffee and I spilled some on my hand. He cleaned it off with his finger which I thought was kinda weird. But I remember kinda enjoying that he cared for me. I think I was craving human contact and care so much. I never found him attractive. He was honestly like the furthest thing from myn type. He also gave me his jacket as we were leaving because it was freezing. I refused to put it on because I felt like that was restricted for my boyfriend. I just sat it on my hands in the car because I didn;t want to be rude to him. Anyways, I tried to set him up with another friend too. I remember wanting to have him and my boyfriend meet sometime. I wanted them to maybe become friends one day, I just didn't know how to do so without my boyfriend freaking out that I had a male friend. Anyways, I remember one time we were texting and I sent him the softball roster ( I am on the softball team) and asked him which one he would want me to set him up with. I remember he said none of them were really his type and I was like “hmm maybe he really doesn’t find me attractive, interesting” because most of my guy friends would have been like “I like one of them but she has a man (indicating me). I remember being like “dang maybe I’m ugly” but then I was like no, I don’t want him anyways. Anyways, I told my boyfriend the following week about everything that happened. I had looked up online if having a guy friend was wrong and people kept saying that keeping it a secret was wrong so that's when I told him. I didn’t want to do anything wrong or hurt my boyfriend. I loved my boyfriend, I just really wanted a friend at this time to hang out with. I also remember thinking that if my boyfriend and I broke up I would never date this friend, but it would be nice to have someone there as a friend to be there for me. This guy friend was very unattractive to me, and when I truly reflect I didn’t even really care about who he was as a person. I didn’t pay attention to what he said or what made him him, I just liked that he paid attention to me. When I told my boyfriend I immediately stopped being friends with this guy. I noticed that I didn’t care that I was no longer friends with him- like it didn’t hurt me to cut him out of my life at all. i have so much fear because i looked stuff up and it said stuff about cheating. i never in the moment thought i was crossing the line into cheating in my head because I thought i was keeping boundaries so now i am so freaked out. i have been so distraught the past year waking up every morning worried about if i cheated. i have thought about it every second of every day in fear.",1,1745899541.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

**Coworker [25F] thinks we [22F] [20 - 30 F/M] are using ""office politics"" to bully her?**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!hostile workplace, racism, accusations of bullying,!<

[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/H52AfaF1Y9)  **Feb 16, 2017**

I've been a high school girl, so I know bullying in the form of ostracization. But this is not the case. There are no ""office politics"" oppressing the victim. 

More or less, everyone in our office became close knit about 3 months ago. We were all in the same training class for a new branch in our company. After finishing training, majority of the people in the office felt comfortable exchanging Facebook info. 

One person, Kathy [25F], told us all she didn't use Facebook. This was a lie because I had searched her name and found her before she stated this. It was an active and very public account, but I never outted her to the rest of the group. I believed it was her nice way of turning us down. I understood because not everyone is comfortable with work friends on their personal media. 

Some weeks past and she lets it slip that she has a Facebook. Something about her dislike about her friends sharing stuff on her Feed. She was called out and she admitted she just didn't want to mix business with pleasure. **Kathy didn't want work to get mixed with her personal life.** Again, we understand.

So more months passed. And during said months, our group interacted outside of work. We went shopping together, had BBQ, movie nights, drank wine and watched Scandal, etc. And with this came inside jokes, more invitations, and emotional connections (?)

Last Monday, Kathy complained to me that our coworkers Brad and Joey were having a laugh during break. She feeling left out, asked what was so funny. They said she just had to be there to get it. She asked them to say it anyway, and that she'd probably get it. They did through giggles and when Kathy didn't laugh, they repeated she just had to be there to get it. When Kathy repeated the joke for me, I burst out laughing because it was an inside joke about something that happened at Joey's movie night. Kathy seemed hurt and went back to her desk. 

Today during break, Patrice asked our other coworker Nancy what she should bring to Scandal night. This exchange happened in front of me and Kathy. Again Kathy piped up and asked what they were talking about. They explained that a few of us coworkers were getting together to watch Scandal and drink wine. Girl talk and stuff. They then started a conversation about the latest episode. 

Kathy pulled me to the side and asked if everyone was doing things without her. I told her yes. She asked why she wasn't invited and I explained that it was because she told us she didn't want to mix business with pleasure. She still insisted it was rude not to ask and they were using ""office politics"" to bully her. She ranted about how she feels victimized and ostracized when she isn't included. 

How do I explain it to her that her not being included is her fault and she can't force people to like/invite her?

TL;DR: Coworker doesn't want to mix personal life with work. She gets annoyed when everyone seems closer and does things outside of work without her. 

EDIT: Bolded for emphasis since there is some confusion. Kathy has stated she doesn't want coworker interaction outside of work. Not just Facebook. 

Ever since Kathy found out everyone does interact outside of work, she's been very curious about my texting (on break or after work). She wants to know if I'm texting X coworker or doing to X's coworker's event. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Commenter**

>You clearly don't *want* to invite her to things at this point, otherwise you'd have said ""oh sorry Kathy, of course you can come to Scandal night!"" You're excluding her, and you're insisting it's what she wants so that you don't have to be discrete about it. You can argue with her about what she said in the past, but it's clear her feelings have changed, and now she wants to be included. If your desire to befriend her has changed, too, that's ok, but you should own it, and be respectful of her feelings.
And making plans in front of someone you don't want to invite is just rude, in general.

**OOP**

>>I don't go to/host Scandal night so I can't really invite her (?). I don't host anything really.

>>I'm not really owning it because I feel like idk, she should ask? She hasn't asked at all to be included but instead complains to me. The person who doesn't really control the events. I can advise but that's all I can do

**Commenter (2)**

>>>Inviting yourself to something you're not invited to is kind of rude and/or desperate.

>>>""She hasn't asked at all to be included but instead complains to me.""

>>>Read between the lines. It sounds like she's asking without directly asking. You can't force others to invite her, obviously.

**OOP**

>>>>So is this an impasse? Coworkers don't want to invite her because they think she doesn't want to go due to previous stance. Kathy not wanting to ask to seem desperate/rude.

>>>>I'm the only one with all the pieces. What should I do? Tell them her stance changed and see where it goes

**Commenter (3)**

>>>>>Yes, you should say that Kathy seemed sad that she wasn't included in group outings. While she may not have seemed interested in the past, her stance seems to have changed. We should start inviting her to events

**UPDATE (is this how I do it?):**

I talked my coworkers during our time before shift starts (usually a coffee and donuts thing for everyone). I phrased it so that it seemed like I was hurt by the group talking about Scandal night in front of me. They understood and promised to keep that to themselves. I also stated that maybe next time me and Kathy could go. 

Nancy was confused and Brad was visually disagreeing/pissed. Apparently, Kathy lied to me about not being invited. Why, I don't know. 

Nancy sent Kathy a FB message weeks ago. Nancy said that she was thinking about having a TV and wine night. She listed a few shows and asked Kathy which would like to watch. It took Kathy a few days to respond after reading it. In the response, she said she “had better things to do then drink cheap wine and watch trash tv.”. Also to not message her on FB again. I physically saw the message to confirm it wasn’t some fake screenshot. I asked Nancy why she didn’t tell us about this and she said it would make the workplace hostile.  

Brad also noted Kathy was a bitch and that I should just check out her Facebook. So I did and like before it's a very active and public account. Apparently, for months she's been posting status (Kathy's Tea) about our workplace. Sometimes venting, sometimes actually harmful statements. One that really bothered Brad was when she took creepshots of everyone and posted that he was a fat N-word (hard r), something about Tyler Perry. He only found this out because one of Kathy's FB friends sent it to him. 

I was also not left out as she posted a direct photo from my own social media and captioned it that I'm a bottle redhead who sets feminist back. There was something about Nancy's Scandal night, but she called it for desperate soccer moms and wannabe stepford wives. 

Brad said he didn't want to tell us because he went to HR and they haven't gotten back to him yet. That they said though it counts as cyber bullying, it's her social media BUT she had her phone on the work floor (against the rules).  

So now I have all this information and confused on what to do. Kathy's been lying to me and very rude herself. But why would she lie to me? What her end game? 

I have about 4 hours until my break with Kathy. Should I confront her?

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/xTz46UU68F)  **Feb 18, 2017 (Next Day)**

So I didn’t confront Kathy during break. I didn’t even get to decide whether or not I wanted to because as soon as my break started, my Supervisor, Linda approached me. Linda explained that she knew Kathy reached out to me about the office clique. Over lunch, she told a story about how something like this happened to her in high school, and that Kathy was reaching out to me to be her proxy. That she knows I don’t hold these events but I should speak on Kathy’s behalf. I said I understood when another Supervisor,Dan butted in. 

Dan said Kathy also told him about the office problem, but he ignored it because he knew she has been invited. They discussed it among themselves and cited that people have used the company email to send out invites. This allowed the Supervisor to see the exchanges between everyone. Kathy had been invited and bluntly stated no to several things/not to waste her time. 

Linda apologized to me and told me to forget about the Kathy issue but the core message still counts. 

When I went to the break room, Kathy made a bee line for me. She started questioning me about how my talk with the Supervisor went. How together we could take down the ageist office group and that we should get coffee after work.  

I lied saying I had a family thing and went home. At home, I checked the reddit post and went back onto Kathy’s fb. There was a new post about how she was playing a little office prank on the office idiot. People commented her to “spill” but she didn’t update them. I feel like that was about me. 

I started screen capping her posts, though only the ones that flat out bullied people. I felt like HR would care about those then any grey areas. Aside from the racist post about Brad, she made a post about a plan to sleep with a married coworker by getting him drunk. 

All of this has been weird. At work, Kathy is a professional, determined and a little head strong. But in this field, thats a good thing. She gets good scores/reviews from clients. But now all I see is her posting vile things about people I care about. Calling it “TruthTea” then running to me like a victim of a make believe problem. 

I’m going to avoid her unless we’re on a project together. I don’t want to be her flying monkey. I don’t know what to believe from her anymore. 

TL;DR: Didn't confront Kathy but she got a Supervisor to talk to me. We found out she was lying and now I'm avoiding her. 

Edit: To answer someone who PM-ed me. Yes, I have high functioning autism. Yes, people at work know.

>>I think Linda was saying what people on my last post were also saying. If someone wants to be included, regardless of their previous stance, I should stick up for them. No one likes feeling left out.


Edit 2:

HR emailed me back. They said they were calling Kathy into work this weekend. Since the office isn't open the weekends, it's clear she's in trouble. As advised from an earlier reply, I'm not going to check her FB anymore. Though watching the fall out would be nice/have a laugh, I would feel petty (?)

I don't think Linda was trying to force me to do anything. She understands that I don't get some social things (If you check out my last post/replies, I literally said Kathy should just ask to be included). She was just trying to explain it in a way I'd understand. 

I fixed ""budded"" to ""butted"". Thank you for catching that.

I looked into the term ""Flying monkey"", and another subreddit came up (RBN). The people described there sound a lot like Kathy. 

I'm signing out now so I won't be replying until Monday. Sorry. 

**Last Edit post Feb 20, 2017 (2 days after this update was posted)**

Edit 3:
It looks like she was fired over the weekend. Her desk is empty but dented. I think she put up a fight because some coworker's desk decor are damaged. 

I won't be checking her FB to see the fall out. I have blocked her and am hoping for the best.

**Sometimes I’ll post even earlier** — but 9:30AM PST will be the guaranteed daily target. 

**Why this schedule?** 

Because over time, I've realized that waiting until the morning ensures I’m working with the best possible information: 

\-Final injury reports 

\-Line movements overnight 

\-Team announcements and last-minute news 

**Posting the night before might sound convenient, but honestly?** It lowers the quality of the plays — and I refuse to compromise on giving you my sharpest work. 👊🏽

I’ve also learned that forcing picks out even earlier than 9:30AM usually means giving up critical information that we can use to our advantage. 

**At the end of the day, my #1 priority is to win — not to rush. 😉**

Thanks so much for trusting me to do what I do best. I'm always, always working to keep us winning for the long haul — and protecting the quality of the plays is a huge part of that. 

I appreciate you all, and thanks for reading!

I tend to go pretty regularly other than the week leading up to my period (premenstrual constipation). I've found that if I keep on top of my regularity that week with senna and lots of fiber, I don't have any trouble. If I don't stay on top of it, I get extreme pain while I pass all the backed up stool in the first two days of my period. It's genuinely awful, often making me vomit from pain. This makes sense hormonally - the premenstrual estrogen spike can slow gut motility.

Well, I am about to get my period any day and I haven't pooped for FIVE DAYS. I have been taking senna, drinking coffee, and eating lots of fiber. I now realize the last one was a mistake. By lots of fiber I mean entire bags of baby carrots with hummus.

I started yesterday with a DIY bowel clean out. I took senna as well as an entire pack of Purelax (Miralax knockoff), drinking 17g every twenty minutes. Lots of liquid diarhhea with zero solids. Today I've taken two 4.5 oz saline enemas, two glycerine suppositories and, this afternoon, an entire bottle of magnesium citrate.

Friends, my bunghole is burning but I still haven't passed anything but liquid. Is it an impaction? Am I doomed? Should I go to the hospital?

Or - is it fine? I have no pain at all. Did the backed up poo turn into liquid?

Any advice is desperately appreciated. I'm really worried there's a giant backlog in there and I don't know what to do.",1,1745899105.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

We’re the first cat café for Springfield, Illinois where we have created a cozy little haven where adoptable rescue cats, far away from the stress of shelter life. Visitors can sip locally roasted coffee, enjoy artisan treats, and relax in our whimsical space surrounded by cuddly cats.

We do more than just host cats at our café, we bring together our community! We're proud to host Music Bingo nights, a monthly Book Club, and local vendor pop-ups. We also give special sanctuary to those cats who need a little extra time, space, and love. 

On June 19, 2025, just a few months after opening our doors in March, a devastating fire destroyed our original cat café and displaced the cats in our care. It was heartbreaking, but we are proud to say we safely rescued every single cat and found homes for all of them. Thanks to the support of our amazing community, we secured a new location, rebuilt from scratch, and reopened just a couple of months later in August. We've been working towards growing stronger and providing a better space. So far, we've helped over 60 cats find their forever homes and created countless good vibes!

We have a lot of love to give, so we’re reaching out beyond the Land of Lincoln through this series of tubes to share our incredible story and find new friends. If our story resonates with you, we’d love your support, even just a share, a kind word, or advice on how to keep growing.

You can check out our story, meet our adorable residents, and learn how to help through our website: [spicatpjs.com](http://spicatpjs.com)

We’re always happy to answer questions, swap rescue stories, or just brighten your day with some cat pics. Thank you for letting us share the rest of our journey!

Commuting won’t be an issue since he drives to people’s homes for therapy which will be all over anyways. 

I definitely don’t want to be in downtown or a super busy area but I also want to be in an area with “enough” going on. 

Things I would love: 
Walkable would be a plus…at least maybe to a coffee shop or a little store. 
Nice area to walk my doggie 
Would love tree lined streets and a “greenery” feeling. Close to a park would be nice! 

I am thinking East? By Shelby park? 

Will be looking at all rentals in person before moving in anywhere anyways so once we arrive I know I will have a better feeling.

We have 2 kids together our kids are special needs and require round the clock care.  Due tho this reason only one person can work, and I cannot afford to hire the round the clock care they need.

I hate the man with every being in me.  He is an ugly human being who believes he can do no wrong.  He doesn’t work, stays home and barely takes care of the kids.  I do the housework, the cooking, the laundry, and am the sole breadwinner.

<div>### Embracing the Elegance of Brown and Black Living Room Decor

Combining brown and black living room decor creates a sophisticated and timeless atmosphere that captivates the eye while providing warmth and modernity. These two colors complement each other perfectly—brown offers natural warmth, while black introduces sleekness and depth. Together, they craft a balanced, inviting space ideal for both relaxation and entertaining guests.

### Key Elements to Incorporate

To master brown and black living room decor, focus on the following design components:

- **Furniture:** Dark brown leather sofas paired with black metal or wood coffee tables provide a striking contrast while maintaining cohesion.
- **Textiles:** Incorporate throw pillows and rugs that mix rich browns with subtle black patterns to enhance texture without overpowering the room.
- **Wall Colors:** Opt for warm brown walls with black accent pieces such as frames, shelves, or light fixtures to highlight the space’s architectural features.
- **Accessories:** Use black vases or brown ceramic pots with greenery to introduce organic elements that soften the overall look.
 
### Tips to Achieve the Perfect Balance

Striking the right balance between brown and black is essential. Avoid letting black dominate the space, which can make it feel heavy. Instead, use brown as the primary base color while strategically placing black accents throughout. Layering different shades of brown—from tan to chocolate—can add dimension and prevent monotony. Additionally, incorporating natural light or warm lighting fixtures highlights the rich tones, enhancing the room’s cozy yet modern appeal.

i was on track for 3 weeks- drinking protein in the morning coffee, bringing fiberous snacks to work, etc. after the first week the brain fog was so manageable that i thought i could live on my lil 6 units forever! over the moon. lost 3 whole pounds (1% of my total body weight 😂).
then week 4 happened and i waited a few too many days, and decided to just skip the week. and then i skipped week 5 because i was supposed to up my dose, so i procrastinated. then it was my birthday, a family trip, easter… all excuses! i didn’t want to think i was going to be a buzzkill! i didn’t want to change my old habits of binge eating and drinking. 

this caused me to have a really serious talk with myself. I am not sure what i was actually procrastinating for, because i am always the one to order the most food, encourage the gas station snack trip, order the last round of drinks, and those aren’t pride points- so wtf? I think i am… craving the yo-yo? am i self sabotaging because I’m having slower progress than i expected? (more progress than i EVER had without it!) or was birthday me really looking out and foreseeing the sema constipation + travel constipation nightmare combo? is my feminist brain trying to fight the patriarchy now that thin is back in?

has anyone experienced this? it feels like when you start a new relationship and you panic because it’s boring to be cared for instead of fought with. 😂 
anyway. last sunday i took another 6 unit dose for good measure, felt like HOT GARBAGE because of the weekend of gas station snacks and margaritas, but knew it was time to move on to bigger and better things because i stopped feeling the medicine after 4ish days.

1kaev1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1kaev1d/chapter_one_feedback_knowing_you/,Chapter one feedback (knowing you),"Hey! Below I’ve pasted the first chapter of my debut novel. I’d love any sort of feedback!!

Chapter One February 2nd 2004

SAVANNAH

I was eleven years old when I first realized the only real problem in my life was me. I was the only common factor.

To say that everyone else had hurt me in unimaginable ways would be true, but I couldn’t blame the people around me for the twisted ways my brain worked.

I had to be the problem.

That was the conclusion I’d come to. It wasn’t a good one, but it was honest.

Life had never played fair. Not with me. It was a disappointment, and a cruel one at that.

Now, at fifteen, not much had changed.

Maybe that was just how the world worked.

Maybe some people were born lucky, and others were born... me.

But I’d gotten good at living with it. At surviving in the grey space between what I showed, and what I truly felt.

And if I had to blame one person for my ways of surviving, there would be no question.

Michael Grey.

My father.

My house should have been the first place I learned safety and love. But that wasn’t the life I was born into. Instead, I got hate, violence and fear.

I think being taught to flinch before laughing has a way of turning you into somebody you never would have been otherwise.

But I also had a problem with focusing on the sadness inside of my soul rather than the happiness I’d found outside of it.

It wasn’t all bad.

I had Liv and Josie who saved me a seat in every room, who never made me question whether I was wanted. Izzie, with sharp edges that cut anybody who got too close, but still tried her hardest to let me all the way in.

Even the boys. Theo, Danny and Billy. Danny, being Izzie’s brother, had never hesitated to invite me to his childhood birthday parties or offer to hang out with me when the girls were out sick. While I never took him up on his offers, I appreciated the thought behind it.

Theo was Liv’s best friend, and despite his best efforts of coping with humour and acting above feelings, he was truly lovely underneath the mask.

Even Billy had been wonderful to me throughout our years at school. Izzie and Billy had a very complicated relationship, to say the least.

Then there was Marlee.

She was gone now. Dead.

Marlee was the kind of friend you could never take for granted. Beautiful, loud, and unafraid of the world. Well, until the world showed her its claws.

I hated the way I felt when I thought about her. It felt selfish, like I was angry at her for leaving me behind. But I wasn’t angry at her. I was angry at the world for taking her away from me. For making her believe her time was over, when it couldn’t have been.

It was last year. Ninth grade. She hadn’t turned fifteen yet, damn it. There was no way some bigger force needed her more than we did.

It hurt knowing I went back today.

We’d done the remainder of last year after her death, but we’d all taken so much time off. The days I did attend had all turned into an endless blur of pain and grief, so this was the first time I’d be going back with a clear mind.

That’s why Izzie was so angry.

They were the closest.

She’d watched it happen.

I would hate the universe too. Her best friend was removed from the planet, and she witnessed it. She heard the sounds. Saw the air leave her lungs. I hated when people labeled her as angry as if she didn’t have every reason to be.

If anybody had a reason to be angry, it was Izzie Harris.

But I could never let those thoughts linger for very long.

If I let them stay, I'd spiral. Again.

I wasn’t ready for this year. But I had to be. Because no one else would do it for me.

I’d learned a long time ago that nobody was coming to save me. That if I didn’t step out of my shell and speak every now and then, there was no way of escaping the pain that consumed me.

I either saved myself, or stayed drowning forever.

Neither of those options sounded very easy, but what else was I supposed to do?

Staring into the shattered mirror by my window, I saw the face that had been the subject of too many unwanted thoughts. Light blue, almost grey eyes that had lost any semblance of toughness over the years. Eyes that had witnessed too much to stay innocent.

My brown waves had finally grown out, now long enough to brush the bottom of my chest. The strands framed my face in a way that made me look somehow less vulnerable, but I knew better. No amount of messy waves or pale skin dotted with freckles would ever change the truth: I was broken, and everyone could see it. No matter how hard I tried to hide it.

I had curves now, too. Not enough to make me feel like I was anything but an afterthought in this world that wanted to break me, but enough to get commented on.

I didn’t like it. Growing into myself had only caused me to be less invisible. I liked being invisible. It kept me alive, after all.

I tugged the navy blue blazer over my shoulders, slinging my bag on top. I wasn’t ready in the slightest. But I had to be. For them.

For my oldest brother Jayden, seventeen years old who acted like he was 25 but really was just a scared kid playing at being a man. For Malcolm, just turned twelve, who still thought he could outrun the world with his stupid little jokes, making everyone laugh when all I wanted was silence. For Leo, who at 6, had the world’s most beautiful smile but couldn’t understand why Daddy resorted to fists instead of words. And for Aidan, 2, who probably didn’t even know what happiness was yet.

I had to be strong for them.

Because otherwise? There would be no strength left.

Because if I didn’t hold everything together, there was no one else who would.

Maybe even for my mother. But God, how I hated her some days. She was the only person with the ability to get us out of this house. But she never would. She’d never help us in the way we needed her to. I loved her. Truly, I did. I knew she loved us too, but she’d sure been horrible at showing it all these years. The reason behind that being the monster she married.

My father.

He was a wreck. A drunk. A man who made promises with his hands, only to break them with fists. I wasn’t afraid of him anymore, not really. At least I wanted to stop being afraid. But I was tired. I was so damn tired of waiting for him to get better, or even to get worse.

I took one last glance in the mirror, smoothing down the blue and yellow dress that sat awkwardly beneath the blazer. This uniform was awfully unflattering.

I pulled open my bedroom door, the creaking sound echoing through the house like it always did in the morning.

Our small, double story house still smelt faintly of cigarettes and whiskey, but that wasn’t anything out of the usual.

I slowly made my way down the stairs, avoiding the steps that I knew would creak.

Jayden was already in the kitchen, sitting at the cracked table with a coffee in hand. He was swirling it in these slow, deliberate movements that told me he was desperately willing himself not to fall apart.

I hated how much I understood.

“Dad’s already gone,” he muttered, his voice flat, devoid of the anger that I knew he was hiding. “Out at the bar again. I’d say he’s not coming back ‘till after midnight, if we’re lucky.”

I swallowed hard, not trusting myself to speak. Jayden wasn’t angry anymore. Not like he used to be. And that scared me more than his anger had. Now? He was just… numb. A shell of a human.

Jayden was eighteen this year.

If he wanted to, he could leave in May.

No questions, no control.

But I knew he wouldn’t.

He would never willingly leave us in this house alone, even though it killed him to stay.

I hated that he felt the need to do that.

His only consolation was his girlfriend, Caroline Bailey. The two of them had been dating on and off for years, and I knew he was utterly in love with her. Consumed by her.

I loved that he had that.

I admired his strength in that area. Me? Being in a relationship was the last thing I wanted. I couldn’t deal with the weight of another person relying on me when I couldn't give them what they needed.

Jayden and I, while raised so similarly, had grown up to be polar opposites.

Besides the obvious things, his blonde hair and sharp, hazel eyes in contrast to my features, we had merely one similarity.

While his hands balled into fists when intimidated, I froze. Or I cried.

He let people in.

I didn’t.

He knew how to defend himself.

I didn’t.

It was always funny to me, the way two people could lead the same childhood yet turn out as two entirely different people.

Malcolm sat down at the table then, dragging me away from my thoughts. He had a cheap magazine in his small hands, fingers tracing the pages like they were a map to someplace else. Someplace better.

Malcolm was practically the same as Jayden. Same looks, same personality. His face was still innocent, and we’d shielded him from a lot of it, but that wasn’t to say he thought we lived a wonderful life.

I knew he’d get it soon enough. After all, you can shield kids from a war as long as you like, but you can’t hide the fact they’re growing up in the middle of one.

Jayden and I were living proof of that.

Leo was on the floor, playing with some broken toy I couldn’t even recognize anymore. He looked up at me with wide, trusting eyes, and it almost hurt to look at him. He was young enough to stay protected now, but he’d be ten in a few months. For me and Jayden, ten years old was where it all went wrong.

I’d do anything in my power to keep that from happening to him.

I poured myself a glass of water, trying to avoid looking at Jayden.

I didn’t miss it. The way his brown eyes scanned my body for bruises before he met my eyes, the way he monitored the breathing in my parents’ room like a soldier on patrol.

“Do you need me to drop you off?” Jayden finally asked, his voice almost too calm, as though he didn’t want to break the fragile silence that hung between us.

I shook my head, throat tight. “Liv’s picking me up.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Liv’s fifteen.”

“You were fourteen.”

A small chuckle escaped his lips, causing me to grin. “Alright, Savvy. Just… don’t die.”

“Right.” I gave a small smile, turning to leave the kitchen.

As I approached the front door, his rough voice called after me. “You’ll do wonderful, Savvy.”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t.

With that, I was stepping back into the real world. The one I’d spent the entire summer hiding from.

“Sav!” Liv called, poking her head out the window. Her blonde curls were thrown into a messy bun, flyways escaping in every direction, but it didn’t matter. Liv could show up in pyjamas and bed-hair and still look like she stepped right out of a fairytale.

“You’re never on time.”

I groaned, sliding into the passenger seat. “I’m sorry!”

She glared at me while turning the car on, but there was a smile in her voice. “Do you have some sort of personal vendetta against punctuality?”

I laughed. Like, really laughed.

Liv was the only one able to stop me caving in on myself.

She was the only one that had pulled me out of my bubble wrap.

“You’re lucky I love you,” she said, flicking on her blinker with unnecessary aggression.

I grinned, buckling my seatbelt. “You’re legally obligated to. Best friend code.”

She rolled her eyes but leaned over to squeeze my hand before pulling out onto the main road.

“Can I convince you to join cheer this year?” Liv asked, hopeful.

“Lower your dreams,” I laughed, but it went deeper than that.

I didn’t have any form of control over my life.

I wasn’t the sort of girl who could show up. The type of girl to be a cheerleader. I wasn’t carefree like everyone else.

“Fine,” she sighed dramatically. “I’ll try again later in the year.”

I smiled along, but my attention was elsewhere.

Because the middle seat in the back was where Marlee sat. The seat that would forever be empty in her absence.

She’d left a hole in our hearts, and she didn’t even know it.

But I couldn’t dwell on it. I couldn’t let the thoughts in, or I’d spiral. Again.

If I’d learned anything in the past few years, it was the fact that I needed to allow myself the happiness I found outside of my soul instead of the sadness buried inside.

That’s why I was still here.

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound. ",2,1745898590.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

The gift giving stuff started because she didn’t have a debit card yet and never carried cash, so I’d just buy her things since we’d go to the bookstore or bakery nextdoor during my break since her dad wouldn’t allow her to go unless she was with me/another worker he trusted. Just things like coffee, energy drinks, snacks, a band magazine, dessert stuff, etc. I told her to not pay me back/that it was fine- which went on for almost a year.

Then her mom invited me and the daughter’s other favorite coworkers to her sweet 16, I got her a $80 custom band hoodie she had been raving ab a lotttt for months. She was happy, told me it was her favorite gift, and still wears it a lot. Her parents are rich and she said they just get her expensive things she doesn’t care for (like designer purses/shoes, perfumes, etc) since they buy it *because* it’s expensive/trendy not bc it’s something she’s interested in.

For my birthday, she bought me a $10 custom band pin I mentioned wanting (ironically I had bought the same pin for myself so we basically traded pins as ‘gifts’ even though at the time she didn’t listen to the band I like) after her parents let her get a debit card then for Christmas, she bought me a horror comic book and picked out the gift my boss gave me (I didn’t get her anything bc I wasn’t expecting anything 😅) which was a set of my favorite bath and body works scent.

I graduate college soon and she bought me like way too many items. She said she got me 9 things which I thought were all band pins bc she was joking ab getting a $4 set of them but then revealed it’s like $150 worth of stuff (2 band pins, 5 band key chains, a band candle, then a band onesie). It’s her money, not her parent’s, since she has a job but I feel so guilty and told her that’s way too much. She said it’s like paying me back for all of the coffees/etc I used to buy her.

I told her I’d just have to get her a ton of stuff for her graduation in a joking tone but I feel like she shouldn’t be spending all of that on me. She recently said something about how I’ll be leaving (my job) soon to work in what I majored in/asking if I’ll ever visit so I’m not sure if it’s bc of that or not :(",1,1745897783.0,Advice,1,0.67,False

It started with stumbling around. I couldn't keep my feet under me. Then I started losing track of where I was. I felt like I'd just appear on the other side of the store. When I failed to remember how to work the register or give proper change is when I paged my manager. 

I went on lunch and called poison control who went over my med list and, with my history and the absolute fuck ton of interactions that popped up on her screen, she told me to go to the ER. I asked if it would be okay for my fiance who's 30 minutes out to come get me and drive me. She said no and to call an ambulance based on symptoms. 

Called my manager and told him we need an ambulance and by that time my hands were clenching into fists and I was getting sharp cramps in my legs. I, also, could barely keep my eyes open. 

EMS got there really quick and did an eval and my blood pressure was through the roof (like 170+/120+) and I couldn't stand on my own. I also was very confused still. 

They get me to the hospital where they double check all the interactions, keep an eye on my BP and vitals and give me medication to relax my spasming muscles. 

I am now home recovering over the next day with more medication to reduce any lingering spasms. I've been told to stop taking my new medication till I can revisit with neurology and to avoid nutmeg if I can or even go as far as to put it on an allergy list. 

Tldr: I poisoned myself with a cup of coffee with a decent amount of nutmeg in it + my normal meds + 2 of my emergency meds = I landed myself in the ER via EMS in the middle of my shift. ",8,1745897764.0,retailhell,0,0.9,False

# What Is “Simpler Trading – Kody Ashmore – Drama Free Day Trades ELITE (Kody’s 1% Per Day Strategy)”?

If you've ever dreamed of wrapping up your trading day before most people even finish their first coffee, then you’re going to want to check out **Simpler Trading – Kody Ashmore – Drama Free Day Trades ELITE (Kody’s 1% Per Day Strategy)**. This course spills all the secrets of how Kody Ashmore – a Marine veteran turned pro trader – makes trading simple, fast, and (almost) stress-free. The heart of it? He shows you how he pulls a consistent 1% per day on his account using 0DTE (zero days to expiration) options. Yep, that's right – in and out, same day, no drama!

# Who’s Behind This?

The brains behind **Simpler Trading – Kody Ashmore – Drama Free Day Trades ELITE (Kody’s 1% Per Day Strategy)** is none other than Kody Ashmore. He’s not your typical finance guy in a suit. Kody’s a former Marine with real-world grit who found his way into trading while deployed overseas. Slow internet forced him into swing trading options, and later, he evolved into a prop trader. His main goal? Make weekly income from short-term trading without sweating bullets over every tick of the market.

# Why Should You Care About This Strategy?

Because time is money, and this strategy respects both. Instead of grinding through hours staring at screens, Kody’s method is designed to get you in and out of trades quickly and cleanly. He teaches how to determine your *bias* for the day (where you think the market won’t go), set your trades, and get on with your life. The best part? No overnight risk, no fancy scanning tools needed, and no need to babysit your trades. **Simpler Trading – Kody Ashmore – Drama Free Day Trades ELITE (Kody’s 1% Per Day Strategy)** focuses on keeping things, well, drama-free.

# When Can You Start Seeing Results?

Kody’s own case study showed a whopping 60%+ account growth in just three months. Imagine stacking small, steady wins daily. If you commit to following the process he lays out in **Simpler Trading – Kody Ashmore – Drama Free Day Trades ELITE (Kody’s 1% Per Day Strategy)**, you could start seeing improvements in your trading confidence (and results) in just a few weeks. It's not some overnight millionaire thing, but it's a real, repeatable system.

# Where Does This All Happen?

You get access to a full package of recorded live trading sessions (12 in total), a full 1% Per Day Strategy Class, and (if you grab the Elite Package) the legendary Squeeze Pro Indicator created by John Carter. Plus, if you pick Pro or Elite, you can tap into Small Account Mastery (SAM) sessions where Kody trades live and shares his market reads. All this is done online so you can watch and learn from anywhere.

# How Does It All Work?

The magic sauce is 0DTE options combined with a simple bias: pick a side, set the trade, and let it play out. No overthinking. No obsessing. You’ll learn how to stack probabilities in your favor by using the Greeks smartly and why the 1% per day goal isn't blocked by the pattern day trading rule (a HUGE plus if your account is under $25K). Thanks to Kody's straight-up teaching style, **Simpler Trading – Kody Ashmore – Drama Free Day Trades ELITE (Kody’s 1% Per Day Strategy)** is super beginner-friendly but still sharp enough for seasoned traders.",1,1745897703.0,CyreneLearning,1,1.0,False

Delays galore! The crypto currency watch is in full swing, but with these hurdles, confidence is shaken. Will it ever be a smooth ride for crypto?

## Market Volatility and Investor Confidence in the Crypto Currency Updates

The world of crypto is like a rollercoaster, and the SEC's delays are the greasy nachos that make it all too real. Increased volatility? Check! Uncertainty? Double check! But hey, if they eventually approve these things, maybe the rollercoaster will have seatbelts.

## Futures vs. Spot ETFs: Understanding the Crypto Trading Today

Futures-based ETFs and spot ETFs are like apples and oranges. One's got contracts, the other's the real deal, and the SEC's been treating spot ETFs like they're the last slice of pizza at a party.

## The Regulatory Landscape: SEC's Role in Crypto Currency Updates

The SEC - the ultimate gatekeeper. With Brazil already launching their spot ETF, the U.S. is still in the waiting room. But don't worry, the SEC might finally take a break from its coffee and donut run. Maybe...

## Investment Opportunities: What Spot ETFs Mean for the Cryptocurrency Market Update

Spot ETFs could be the golden ticket for a new wave of investors. More opportunities, more mainstream adoption, and more chances for us to say ""HODL!"" with pride!

The SEC's watchful eye might just kickstart some shiny new tech in the crypto space. Secure custody solutions? Yes, please! Improvements? Bring them on!

## A Closer Look: Evaluating the Performance of the Eightree Smart Plug

Beyond the advertised features, how well does the Eightree Smart Plug perform in real-world scenarios? Here's a breakdown of key performance aspects:

*   **Connectivity and Reliability:** A smart plug is only as good as its connection. Is the Eightree wifi plug reliable? Does it maintain a stable connection to your Wi-Fi network? Unreliable connectivity can lead to frustration and negate the benefits of automation. Factors like Wi-Fi signal strength and network congestion can impact connectivity. consider investing in a Wi-Fi extender if you experience connectivity issues.

*   **Responsiveness:** How quickly does the smart plug respond to commands issued through the app or via voice assistants? Delays can be annoying. A responsive smart plug should react almost instantly, providing a seamless user experience. Server latency and network speed are key influencing factors.

*   **Energy Monitoring Accuracy:** If energy monitoring is a key feature you're after, assess the accuracy of the data provided. Can you rely on the readings to provide accurate insights into your energy consumption? Inaccurate readings can lead to flawed decision-making and undermine the purpose of energy monitoring. Compare it to other measuring devices if possible.

*   **App Functionality and User Experience:** The Eightree smart plug app is the central interface for controlling and managing the smart plug. Is the app intuitive and easy to use? Does it offer a complete set of features, including scheduling, timer functions, and energy consumption data? A clunky or limited app can detract from the overall user experience.

*   **Compatibility and Integration:** Seamless integration with your existing smart home ecosystem is crucial. Assess the Eightree smart plug's compatibility with voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as other smart home platforms. The more seamlessly it integrates, the more convenient and powerful your smart home setup will be.

1kaefz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/1kaefz6/my_journey_and_tips_for_heartburn_management/,My journey and tips for heartburn management,"Got HM at 21 after a few years of figuring out what was going on. Towards the end, I was almost exclusively on liquid diet. Following surgery, i was able to eat again and I gained 40lbs over 2 years (10 would have been healthy, the rest was overweight)

After the surgery, my heartburn was unreal for years. Almost unbearable. Drs had me on high dose PPI (Nexium and others) but nothing worked. My heartburn would get so bad that it frequent resulted in vomiting. I was working third shift, going to school full time, didn’t exercise much, was stressed, etc. 

 After I graduated grad school, I got a job where I was able to take care of myself better. I lost 25lbs, exercised regularly, and ate better

Since I made lifestyle changes, I rarely have heartburn. For me, I need 3-5 days of hard exercise. I’ve noticed having strong abs is very important for managing heartburn (maybe has something to do with the fundoplication?) 

I haven’t taken medicine for my heartburn in over 5 years outside of gas x as needed! It’s better now than when I do take it. My drs always give me a hard time on this but I will not go back. The medicine messes with the delicate balance I have found to eliminate the heartburn

I also make sure to manage stress and sleep enough. When I get lax in these things, the heartburn comes back. 

I also never eat:
Coffee
Alcohol 
Chickpeas
Citrus
Sourdough
Bananas (unless blended)

I severely limit:
Coconuts
Sugary food
Spicy foods (some spicy is completely no, others is ok. I’ve noticed it depends on the kind of pepper. Asian spices are safer than Latin spices. I think it depends on if the pepper has capsaicin or not, so numbing peppers are ok)
Foods that make me gassy (eg certain artificial sweeteners, green vegetables)

I also make sure to have two servings of fruit a day. Not less. Not more. I don’t really eat fake or junk food (processed stuff, most fast food). 

It might sound restrictive, but I’m actually very happy with my lifestyle and diet. I enjoy takeout almost every day but usually eat from healthier restaurants. I eat mostly Asian food, some Latin American food, and occasional southern comfort foods (I love fried chicken!). 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk. I hope my story maybe helps someone. My message today is that lifestyle is the number one most important thing for quality of life post HM living with achalasia. ",3,1745897226.0,achalasia,1,1.0,False

I meant to have said get it done smaller by the same artist (because this dude is incredible at what he does) but now that I took the second skin off, I absolutely love it and am so grateful I get to wear my boy on my sleeve. It’s healing well and the picture I just took doesn’t do it justice. I’m not sure what it is but this tattoo just looks huge on camera.As for the reason I wanted to get it removed in the first place is because I had someone come up to me in a coffee shop and tell me that it was ugly. I also had someone who I volunteer with at an animal rescue tell me that I would never get a job with a tattoo like that. I had another person who I was close with tell me that it’s a stupid blob. Yes it may be a blob but that’s okay. I’m 19 and just being told that stuff from people in my daily life and a stranger is what really made me consider removing it. To the people who have said why would I get it there with no other tattoos in the area, that’s because I’m going to have a sleeve of paw prints going up my arm of any pet I have. His paw print is the second on my arm, I have my cat’s paw print on my wrist so that’s why I wanted it. And for those saying that I shouldn’t have gotten it exactly like his paw print, it’s what I wanted and exactly what I asked for, the artist actually made this way better than what I had given him to work with. It also magically shrunk somehow and is now measuring at a little over 3in instead of 4 no clue how the hell that happened, I’ve got a few other tattoos and never experienced that. But I love it more and more with each day that passes and was just in shock with how big it was which was fine (that’s my fault 100%) and like I mentioned with all the comments I was getting it was really starting to stress me out because I’ve NEVER gotten so many reactions from any of my other tattoos.

  Like the title says my mother in law told me to get over it. Not in exact words but the message was more than clear.

*** Before i get into it i just want to say She's not a bad person She's actually a really nice person who loves her kids unconditionally and has accepted my wife(who is also trans) and her son(who is gay) without question and both of their spouses. She just lacks emotional intelligence and doesnt understand the damage it causes. Please dont throw shade or hate on her

So i have my good days and my bad days while coping and trying to recover from my family disowning me back in january. They werent good people they were actually very abusive ass holes but its my family and it hurts and i cant deny that

I was talking to my mother in law while making coffee in the kitchen(we currently live with them). And my family kinda came up because they only way ive been able to cope with reminders of them is by making jokes about them cause somehow that helps in the moment. She responded very frustratedly with ""no no no. They dont matter im your parent now!! And as soon as your car gets repaired you need to get out of the house and go do something. Get a job or something (i lost my job cause my car broke down) and until then stop thinking about them and start going on walks or to the park"" and then she stormed away. 

This has been a very common thing for her to say the last 5 months ""im your parent now!!"" And its been used to dismiss any mention of my family at all. Its causing me to question if i should just get over it already and move on. And it making me question the validity of my feelings and of me mourning them in the first place cause any time it gets brought up to friends and in laws it gets immediately dismissed by everyone and its created an extremely isolating loneliness in this where the only person i even have is my wife and even she doesnt know what to say and pretty noticeably feels uncomfortable with giving advice without personal experience and this is luckily something she never had to face. But its also hard for her to see me go through this. 

So my question is. Should i just try and get over it? Is feeling this even valid its been almost 5 months and everyone seems to think i should be over it already? I dont know what i should feel",3,1745896526.0,trans,2,1.0,False

I (25f) met a girl at my new job. She is 22. From the start, I’ve had an “off” feeling about this girl. She always wanted to speak to me, and always wanted my attention. It felt suffocating… but honestly, I figure she’s lonely so I’d speak. She was insistent on us being in contact. 

Her boyfriend made her quit the job because a guy had a crush on her. She still contacted me even when I didn’t seem interested. I felt bad for her. One thing led to another, and we ended up hanging out. 

Ever since then, she puts immense pressure on me every single week / every other day to hang out. I’m really not that kind of person. She always wants to go ride around town in my car, go get coffee, this + that. I keep having a bad feeling, but again, I feel bad for her because I think she’s lonely, which is why she is SO incredibly clingy. I’m very mature for my age, and she still acts like she’s 16. I feel like I’m hanging out with a young girl when I’m with her sometimes. 

Here’s some things that bother me. 

First and foremost…. she hits her boyfriend. Yes. You heard that right. She slapped him in the face, pushed him, etc. This stuff is really triggering for me. I live 35 minutes away from her. She has no car. I am expected to Taxi us around everywhere. She never offers me gas money….. my financial situation is tight currently so this is really stressful. She wants to shop but never has any money. Never tips at restaurants, but loves to eat out. Her boyfriend sucks, he’s gross, and has never gotten up to speak to me when I would drop her off. All of her previous friends left her because she’s so clingy and wouldn’t respect their space. She apologized to me for doing that, but she keeps doing it. She has absolutely NO ambition and NO motivation. Complains about how tired she is when I work triple the hours she works. Where i work, we get a lot of theft and I tell her how sad it is that they steal from us, and she proceeds to DEFEND the thief!!! I’m very mature for my age. I feel like we just aren’t a good match….. but she is so pushy and when I don’t want to hang out, she says stuff like “I will kill myself” or “I’m so depressed” or “I’m going to cry” and rarely ever asks me if I’m okay when I have problems. It just feels like I’m her Mom when we hang out. She’s very immature and I just don’t know what to do. She makes me feel bad for her by talking about her terrible mother. She still blames her bad habits on her childhood. She doesn’t care about money. She is SUPER nice and compliments me, then asks for stuff like a hangout. I feel manipulated into hanging out with her…… I am going through health stuff (which she KNOWS), and honestly I just want to cancel our plans in 3 days. But I know she will freak out. She lives 35 minutes away. I have to go pick her up, bring her to my house, bring her back home, then come back home myself. That’s literally over two hours of driving in one day. My only off day of the week. She’s never once mentioned her boyfriend driving her. It’s just expected that I come do all that. When we hang out after I get off work (which I hate doing), she finds reasons to go other places and literally keeps me out half the night. Knowing I have to drive almost 40 minutes back home and be awake for 4am. All this pressure to hang out all the time is really making me resent her. It’s unbearable. The clinginess is the worst. She keeps saying she’s sorry, but then never changes. She doesn’t respect my time, or the fact that I also want to spend time with my partner. I work 45 hours a week at least. He does too. She sometimes works 15 hours a week. She doesn’t understand what it feels like to juggle all this pressure to hang out, plus a full time job. 

Please help me. Am I being judgey?? Am I just not sensitive enough?? Am I just being an old lady?? Is it wrong to cancel the plans, and end the friendship?? I’m not even comfortable with her coming to my house after she’s literally defending theft multiple times. My fiancé and I have A LOT of valuables in our home. We also have property with many assets / valuables. I am so stuck because she tells me I’m all she has. Are these fair reasons to reject this friendship??

Special Mention:

Oreo Gingerbread. This was my #11. My #9 and #10 only made the top 10 because I thought they had two of the best creams of the whole lot. Their biscuits were not good at all, so my #11 and #12 could easily have been in the top 10. I seemed to be the only one who liked my #12, Oreo Mint Chip.

Simple Mills Nut Butter

You'll notice that the Simple Mills Nut Butter was the worst one on 3 lists and was my 11th worst (Kid 2 hated it even more than the mint ones).

My home-made cookie was the overall #1, taking the top spot on two lists and also making my top 10, but you'll notice that it makes Kid 2's worst list.

Anything that didn't make my top 25 or my bottom 13 was, for me, fine. I would rate them all similarly.",2,1745896301.0,snacking,1,1.0,False

This is how it sits with my I shape couch. I plan on getting a different couch eventually, but I think I like the I shape and I can't really put in a 3 seater and a chair.

Should I stick with this or return it? The other one is rectangle (see picture) and would pretty much come out to the end of the couch lengthwise and extend a little past the longer part of the L. But I feel that it gives more space in the front and doesn't overpower my TV stand, as it's small (47in). It's already a small space and feels a bit tight and I want to make sure I have space to walk past the wall where the couch and the dining table is - that's why I went for square. Would the rectangle be ok? It would still give space to walk through, but I don't know if it would be too tight. Pardon the mess. Also, would you recommend sticking to a dark grey couch? I want to change this one and I have the dog, or should I go for a lighter grey? My kitchen has dark grey and light grey, so it kind of ties in. This table is 31 inches and was the smallest square one I could find. I also have very little lighting in here and I am debating on getting another standing lamp and putting it at the end of the couch by the wall where the armrest is on that small space (see pictures). Would this look ok or is it too tight for the space? Is this lamp ok as well? It looks the same as the one I have in front.",1,1745896145.0,DecorAdvice,0,1.0,False

Howdy. Today was mind numbing yearly training for work. I am an owner of one very squishy brain. Need more coffee I think. I work in tech, read a lot, get tattoos, obsess over coffee, love horror movies, philosophy, having long conversations and walks with my dog. Do some working out. Still in my skinny-ish jeans, vans, band t shirt era (always all black. Not a phase). Little too isolated and introverted these days. Hit me up! ",1,1745895540.0,chat,1,1.0,False

This is a throwaway, and all names are changed to protect… well… me (58F)!

First of all, I LOVE YOU, Charlotte! I hope my fellow potato sleuths have some wisdom for this DNA drama.

So, back in 2019, my daughter (we’ll call her Chloe) did a DNA test through Ancestry. Fast forward to 2022, and she calls me saying, “Who is Travis Smith and how are we related?” Cue dramatic music.

I had no clue. We started digging, and based on the data and his age, we figured Travis had to be my half-brother—making him Chloe’s uncle. Jaw. Drop.

He and I messaged a bit. He tried to talk to his mom, but she shut him down hard. I took a test too, and sure enough—he’s my half-brother.

I told my sister (bless her) who was shocked, but agreed to get tested along with her kids. You guessed it—they all match him too. Now we’re all in Travis’s family tree. We’re even friends on Facebook and he’s messaged asking about my (our) nephews. He’ll be in my state on Mother’s Day, and we’re planning to grab coffee. I’m honestly so excited to meet him.

Here’s the messy part…

At the time Travis was born, both his parents were married… and my dad was married to his current wife—let’s call her Lisa, my stepmother from hell since I was 5. Think evil stepmom in every sense. We’re very low contact.

Now Chloe wants to make an announcement at our next family gathering (yikes), my sister wants to stay silent, and I’m torn.

I want to tell my dad privately. Maybe he already knows. Maybe not. But either way, I feel like he should know, especially now that it’s out there. The others think I should leave it alone.

So tell me: Would I be the a-hole if I told my dad he has an illegitimate son",19,1745895487.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,8,0.91,False

The back stories are too long to write but what starts as a trickle turns into a broken dam 3 months later. I have never had a red flag like ""can be late often"" or ""leaves his socks on the coffee table"" not eventually turn into ""completely fails to show up for your plans when you're already waiting"" or ""when no longer trying to impress you house looks like a disaster zone and if you move in together this will be your job"". 

Whats weird is red flags in women are literally just personality quirks. Woman who talks too much and asks too few questions about you? She remembers you mentioned not having forks at work and buys you a set. Woman who was late for the last meed up? Apologizes and asks to take you for lunch after. Little things in women are PART of their personality, in men they are the DEFINING features of their personality, little windows into how they will eventually try to exploit you. 

Has any woman overlooked a red flag and turns out he was normal and it was just a quirk, he was self aware and took steps to make up for it in other areas?",4,1745895465.0,AskWomenOver30,6,0.7,False

I’m finishing up at a Bible college with basically a missions/cultural studies degree. I would like to do something in ministry or missions, but honestly I also just love working at coffee shops. I would love to own a coffee shop someday that I could use for ministry or missions in some way, or maybe have a job where I could travel to different countries for a little while to visit missionaries and see what they do. I know someone who does something like that and I think it would be so cool. Basically, I just love to travel and see different places and what God is doing around the world. It would be really cool to live overseas at some point, but I’m not sure if that will ever be an option. Plus, I’ve moved a lot growing up so it’s hard for me to imagine being in one place for more than like four years.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend (21m) for over a year and a half and we’re hoping to get engaged soon. I love him so very much and really want to spend my life with him. He’s from another country but he wants to live in the US. He’s graduating this year too from the same college and looking for a job in the states.

The thing is, sometimes I feel like I don’t totally want the same life he does (if that makes sense?). There are times I feel this tug to go overseas and do missions work, and he’s more focused on staying and building a life in the US. I asked him if I felt called to go overseas after we were married would he be willing to go, and he said yes as long as he could have a job there. So it’s not like we’re incompatible or anything. I would also love to stay in the US if I found the right ministry job. But sometimes I just feel this tug like maybe I’m doing something wrong?? I wonder if it’s less about a deep calling to missions and more about my desire to experience living overseas, traveling, things like that. It’s also hard because I can’t go overseas for my cross-cultural internship this summer and I’m really sad about missing out on that experience.

I don’t know. I might just need some prayer and insight because I’m feeling a little torn right now...

Not that I dont want to marry him, I really do, but there's just that tug of a thought that I might miss out on what I wanted before we started dating and planning our life together...? Also, right now, marrying him is my only stable plan lol so idk

And since I have mentioned it in a lot of confessions, I did get a lot of DMs to tell exactly how it happened

Last month, I was flying back home — Amman to Bangalore — after a brutal work trip.  
Exhausted, business class ticket in hand, makeup perfect, heels high (obviously, black Louboutin Hot Chicks, my soulmates).

Anyway, I was killing time in the airport lounge, sipping coffee and scrolling through Middle East political updates (nerd alert), when he sat down across from me.

God.

Mid-40s, salt-and-pepper beard, sharp dark eyes, expensive but relaxed clothes — not flashy, but that confident kind of masculine that just *hits you* without trying.

We started talking — about geopolitics, economics, Indian elections, books, travel... and somehow, within minutes, I was laughing like I hadn’t in months.

It wasn’t flirting — not yet.  
It was connection.

Smart. Funny. Challenging. Curious.

The kind of man who *listens* when you speak, but whose every glance feels like a thumbprint being pressed slowly into your skin.

When boarding time came, I should’ve floated off to my luxury seat.

But... no.

Something primal overruled me.

I *wanted* more of that conversation.  
*Needed* more of him.

So yes — I gave up my Business Class seat.  
I literally asked the gate agent to put me in economy next to him.  
Handed my premium ticket to a stunned young techie who couldn’t believe his luck.  
Smiled, grabbed my carry-on, and slipped into Seat XXX — right beside my stranger.

He just smiled when he saw me.  
Like he already knew.

The flight?  
God, it was a tease.

Hours of quiet talk, thigh brushes, shared glances when turbulence jostled us closer.  
At one point, he reached across me to adjust my overhead light — his fingers just grazing my collarbone — and I swear I was ready to *cum* right there.

When we landed in Bangalore at 3 a.m., the sexual tension was so thick it could have suffocated the plane.

I pulled him aside in the terminal, heels clicking sharply on the polished floors.

No games. No coy smiles.

>

He didn’t hesitate.

Room XXX.

As soon as the door clicked shut behind us, he grabbed me — hands in my hair, mouth crushing mine, teeth grazing my lower lip.

My heels clicked against the marble floor as he pushed me back against the wall, lifting my leg high against his hip, grinding his hard cock against my soaked panties.

I was gasping, moaning already:

>

He stripped me ruthlessly — jacket first, then blouse buttons popping one by one, then my skirt bunched around my waist.

But not my heels.

He growled against my throat:

>

God, the way he said it — filthy, commanding — I would have done anything.

He bent me over the edge of the king-size bed, one hand tangled in my hair, the other yanking my panties down and off.

I felt his cock — thick, heavy, perfect — press against my dripping folds.

He didn’t tease.  
He didn’t ask.

He plunged into me with one brutal thrust.

I screamed into the pillow:

>

The sound echoed off the high ceilings, mixing with the rhythmic slap of his hips against my ass, the scrape of my heels against the sheets, the messy wet sounds of pure, filthy need.

He fucked me like a man starved — pounding deep, hitting that perfect spot again and again, dragging moan after shattered moan from my lips.

At one point he pulled out, spun me around, threw me onto my back — my heels kicked up on either side of his broad shoulders — and slammed back inside, riding me hard, deep, claiming every inch of me.

When I finally came — and god, it felt like *falling through a burning star* — I screamed so loud I was sure half the hotel heard:

>

He wasn’t far behind — grunting, growling, cumming deep inside me with brutal, pulsing thrusts that left me gasping and boneless.

We collapsed together — sweaty, panting, stunned.

No words needed.

I left him a note in the morning:

*""Thank you for the best wrong seat of my life.*  
*Find me next time — heels on, doors unlocked.""*

And now I’m back home...  
Still wearing those black Louboutins today.  
Still smiling.

Still dripping with the memory of him.

No numbers exchanged, no emails taken. I want him to be a memory, just a figment of my imagination!",3,1745895198.0,TheUnfilteredRoom,9,1.0,False

Backstory.  2 years ago in March I had some random ankle and foot swelling and a wicked bruise forming on a cold day that all I really did was make coffee and relax. It got wicked ugly.. didn't hurt all that much overall but some unusual pain points. 

Eventually got it checked out and turned out it was a syndesmotic sprain and I ended up in a boot for 8 weeks. 

In the last few weeks my OTHER ankle had a little swelling and lo and behold a wicked bruise above and around my ankle bone. Oh goodie. 

Went in today to just get it checked out.    Guess who's back in the boot for the other side now? 

All I can think of that caused it was crouching to get laundry out of the dryer. 

Left the doc, and all I could do was laugh when I got in the car because I 100% called it as soon as I saw the bruising..

Oh to be a problematic gumby with bones.

I figured I can get some answers here for someone with some more knowledge on this topic than me. I (M22) have always been a very active person and love a fairly healthy lifestyle. I used to wrestle in high school (126lbs weight class my senior year @ 5’9) and definitely used to abuse my body since that was what you had to do for wrestling at a high level which created eating disorders and a lot lot lot of starving yourself and dehydrating yourself weekly to make weight. That was 4-5 years ago now and sure the eating disorders have gone away but I have been very active in other sports to fill that void and never had a major increase in weight just mainly muscle and slight increase in body fat % since then but more of a healthy increase in weight since I was not starving my body anymore. Quite recently maybe for about 6-7 months I have noticed some rapid weight gain that I have never experienced before and just want to know what the reason it is and if there has been any change in my lifestyle that is the root of it, I recently graduated college and working a 9-5 as an engineer and don’t really have the opportunity to be as active but still try to get out there when I can especially on weekends and really put my body through a lot on the weekends and occasionally throughout the week after work. One thing I have done consistently is drink vanilla lattes in the morning mainly because I hate the taste of straight black coffee but still need that boost of energy for work. Can that be the main reason? And would I see the effects of not drinking caffeine in that form over time or will I need to do more now to burn this unwanted weight. To clarify I am still not overweight just noticing more belly fat and losing my jawline slightly but just want to tackle the problem while I’m young before it’s too late. I’m also currently 5’10” roughly 168-170lbs but I swore to never step on a scale due to the mental challenges of wrestling and making weight on the scale sounds dumb but it’s just something that makes me feel comfortable.

MHey all,

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Want to come over for a drink? Not really, an online drink I suppose. Maybe we can talk about the above stuff. Some things I didn’t mention. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

My boyfriend and I have been together for over 2 and a half years, I know everyone says it but our relationship was truly perfect. I felt like everything I had been through in my life was for a reason because it led me to him. He was so unbelievably kind, supportive of everything I did, patient, understanding of my anxiety and autism, reassuring, caring, he was everything I could have ever dreamed of. If we had an argument or disagreement, we would sit down and talk about it and come up with a solution, apologize, and remind each other that we love each other. I can’t count the amount of times I thought “I didn’t know life could be this easy”. We lived together, we were getting married, we had our whole wedding planned, our whole life planned, everything. We were hoping to move away together within the next year. It was not fake, it was not lovebombing. It was over 2 years of being in a wonderful, beautiful, healthy partnership.

He got laid off last fall and became very depressed over it especially as it was so close to Christmas and he didn’t want me to feel like I had to help him out with money. I ended up getting very frustrated with him and our financial situation and I told him to get out of bed and go get a part time job. I was mean to him. I was straight up mean.
He applied for jobs and didn’t hear anything back, so out of desperation he reached out to a shitty friend of his and got a job working at a friend of a friend’s business. And that’s when everything went wrong. I had a bad feeling about it from the beginning and I told him but he reassured me it would be okay. But it wasn’t. Turns out the friend who got him the job was a drug dealer and so was the owner of the business, and they just started constantly giving my boyfriend cocaine, knowing he had a problem with it in the past and had been doing really well for years. I caught on pretty early and my boyfriend admitted it. But he didn’t stop working there. This man had my boyfriend doing everything for him, working every single day without a day off, using my car to run errands for his business, having him build things for his new bar, having him sell things for him online, I think my boyfriend was scared to say no to him at some point. 
This “friend” he was working for started grooming him to hate me. I caught on to that fast too. My boyfriend started saying things to me that made no sense and were so unlike him, I’d ask him who put these things into his head. Things like him being scared of me and scared I’d hurt him and hurt our animals, saying I was stalking him because I would bring him coffee at work and last week went to his work and called and asked if he could come give me a hug because I had a really horrible day (to which his response was no because “the boys” at work would judge him). I read his phone and his friends were constantly calling me crazy and a she-devil and saying they’d give him a “safe exit” from me. When I asked him, he said he never wanted to leave me and wanted to work on any issues and get married some day. 

He started yelling at me and verbally abusing me. It wasn’t often at first, and then it was constantly. Because he was constantly on coke. Calling me selfish, calling me a cunt and a whore and a bitch, saying I’m not a nice person, that I’m worse than his abusive ex, that I was the worst person he ever met in his life. He would ramble on and on and none of it made sense and all I could do is cry because I was watching the man I loved who I was going to spend my life with turn into someone I didn’t recognize. 

He stopped doing coke for 2 weeks and it was like I had my boyfriend back. He stopped because he was going away to work. We were communicating again, spending time together, our sex life was normal, nobody yelled, I really thought everything was going to be okay. And then his drug dealer friend’s sister passed away and he went down to his house the next day and I knew he was on coke again before he even got home. And it only got worse. 
On Friday he went to work in the morning and we had sex that morning, cuddled, and before he left for work he said “I love you more than you’ll ever know, don’t forget it”. He dropped back in the afternoon and gave me a hug and a kiss and told me he loved me and he’d be home after the wake. And I guess after the wake him and his friends did a shit ton of coke because he went insane. He asked me to bring something down to him at work so I did, and halfway there he called me screaming at me that I’m insane and I’m stalking him and I’m selfish and evil, and I pulled up at his work and said I brought things down for him and tried to give him a hug, and he ran up the stairs screaming “help, this woman is trying to hurt me, that woman there, she’s gonna hurt me”. I asked his boss wtf was happening and he said he didn’t know and they were just having “drinks” after the wake and my boyfriend was sick of me “bothering” him. So I left and went home and my boyfriend called me to pick him up around midnight, and when I did he was angry at me in the car because I “turned his friend against him”, I guess his boss got upset with seeing the way he treated me. I told him to just chill out in the car and come inside and go to bed when he was ready.
I went in and got in bed and that’s when all hell broke loose, he came in saying “oh the little pussy is gone to bed, you’re a coward” and then went on another 30 minute unhinged ramble that made no sense, he twice said he would “beat the ever living fuck out of me” and “punch me the fuck out” if I spoke, and when I finally tried to speak at the end, he poured two cans of beer over my head and opened another and threw it in my face and got it in my eyes, he grabbed my hair and put his face next to mine and said “do you really want to fucking do this?” and I was sobbing and begged him to stop and I got back on the bed and he followed me and I couldn’t stop crying so he covered my mouth with his hand and then plugged my nose at the same time until I was smacking him to get off because I couldn’t breathe, and then he took the blanket off the bed and held it over my face. I managed to get free and he ran down the hallway screaming “why are you hurting me? Why are you hitting me?” I guess to try and make the neighbours think I was hurting him. He grabbed me and kissed me and bit my lip really hard and then he kicked me in the leg and at some point I ended up on the floor and he was on top of me trying to cover my mouth again and he hit me 3 times in the side of the head and he was telling me to open my eyes and look at him and tried to pry them open with his hands. I got him off of me somehow and ran outside with my phone and called the police and they arrested him and charged him and he spent the weekend in jail and was released on bail today and all I feel is guilt for calling the police and doing that to him even though he hurt me so badly. I have a black eye and bruises all over my face and arms and legs. But all I can do is cry because he hasn’t even tried to contact me to say sorry since he got out and I still love him with my whole heart despite what he did and I know it’s stupid but I can’t stop loving him. This person wasn’t him, it was a monster that drugs made him into. And I don’t know how to cope or go on because my entire future we planned is gone and I don’t know how to even wake up on the morning without him and I don’t want to at this point. It hurts too bad.

i am a senior and most people in our program are too, so due to school ending soon we wont be able to see this new addition to its end but we wish to have enough planned out so that the new members for next year wont just be thrown to the wolves. 

We are not doing hot drinks but are putting a focus on simpler cold drinks such as cold brew, iced chai latte, and a matcha latte. is there any specific recipe or method of making a drink you guys would recommend, if so that might help us out. 

what type of profit margin should we be striving for. these are high school students and i want to make it available to all but still be able to make profit from this. 

Are there any other drinks you guys would recommend we start off with. i would prefer something simple but am open to any ideas that could benefit the students for next year. 

Any specific brands of plant based milks or creams or foams that might be better to use than others? 

what might be the best way to market drinks and pastries together. like what are popular combinations?

Really any tips or advice that could be helpful will be good as long as you guys think its worth noting

We had patched things up since the end of March, and I really thought we were okay. But just last week, he told me that during the time we weren’t talking (although, to be fair, we were still communicating—it was just mostly arguments), he started talking to someone he met on Reddit and even met up with her. I’m not even sure if that’s the whole truth or if he’s hiding something more.

This isn’t the first time. He did something similar before the pandemic. And now here we are, back in the same situation. What’s worse is that he’s trying to flip the situation on me, saying I did the same thing just because I talked to someone. But the person he’s talking about is a friend I’ve known since high school. There was nothing romantic or flirty in our conversation (which he saw), yet he insists it’s the same. I didn’t meet that friend in person, and I definitely didn’t see him as a rebound—it was just casual, friendly chatting.

Meanwhile, he admitted to deliberately going on Reddit to look for a rebound and even went on a coffee date.

Now he has the nerve to say that he won’t post about me on social media anymore. He doesn’t visit as often as he used to—he used to come over every other day, now it’s just once a week, sometimes not even that. And I have to be the one asking him to come.

Now I’m wondering: is this still worth fighting for? We have shared properties, we’re engaged, and we were planning to get married this year. It’s hard to detach. We’ve been together for almost seven years, and I come from a conservative family—calling off the engagement would be a huge disappointment for them",2,1745893689.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

I ended up getting a interview for a big company and they were literally paying half of what I was making at my old job. I accepted the job just so I would have some money coming in. Before my start date I just had a feeling that something better would come in so I ended up turning down the offer in hopes something better would come up. 

A little over a week later I got a call from a top company in my city asking me to come in for an interview.   The interview was rough, I was in a room with a couple people from HR and a couple engineers and they just drilled me with questions for an hour. I walked out feeling like I absolutely bombed it.  When I got to my car I did a 5 minute manifestation routine where I imagined myself working there, I put the gps on to see how close the gym was to this new job for my morning workouts, and I also looked how far the closest Starbucks was for coffee runs. I really acted in my head like I already had the job.  I went home and totally forgot about the whole interview. 2 days later I ended up getting a call that they wanted me to start ASAP! They even offered me extra perks that weren’t discussed in my interview.

I truly believe I was able to manifest this job even after my horrible interview!   ",17,1745893554.0,lawofattraction,3,1.0,False
1kadb95,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1kadb95/when_did_we_stop_being_people_to_them/,When did we stop being people to them,"I’m still pretty new to Starbucks, having come back from being a partner before during Covid, but when did we stop being people to them?  Follow the Siren Craft System.  Sequence your drinks accordingly.  Personalize every single cup.  Wear the same outfits.  Perform like the cog you are meant to be.

We aren’t in the coffee business!  We are in the people business!
And we are people too and it is about time that they start treating us like people.  Back to Starbucks!  How about you give us some staff!  How about you stop making our Store Managers work 60+ hour weeks and cover 2+ stores!  How about you stop making all these promises to bring us to a proper “coffee house” experience and then chop all sense of personality and uniqueness out of us!

Stop worrying about your profit lines.  You are not always going to be more profitable than the last year!  It is an unachievable fallacy to think you are always going to get bigger and bigger and always make more and more and more money!  There is always a cap!  Sometimes the economy can suck.  Sometimes the trends are just down.  Sometimes people just wake up and realize that they are being swindled for sugar water, cow lactation, and bean soup!  

I apologize for going on a little tangent there.  I just want to know if it’s always been this way?  I don’t think it has.  I would like to think it hasn’t.  I would like to believe that they actually care about us and want us to thrive.  Do you not realize yet that if your workforce is happy, your company performs better?  Maybe I’m just an idiot or a dreamer, but I would like someone to restore my faith in this and show me that our corporate overlords actually care about every one of our baristas.",22,1745893552.0,starbucks,1,0.93,False

Branch manager, that i dont like, its not a secret, assigns me, assisant manager to be the ""opener"", which sucked.  

3 months in im getting mentioned to that i should put a pot of coffee on when i get on, by branch manager.  Its known by everyone in the office, all 6 of us, that i dont drink coffee.  I kinda laugh and say, in my most polite office speak, lol make your own damn coffee!  ...then a few days later i ended up losing that argument.

F this, but whatever.  ....anyways, there is no dishwasher, everyone uses disposable cups.  So im NOT doing dishes by hand for JUST the damn coffee pot!  And boome!  double coffee was invented!

Old filter with grinds in it, garbage can.  New filter, new coffee grounds, like 6 scoops, maybe these jokers will do more work if they hyper?  Yesterdays coffee in the pot, right in the water pour place.  Top off with new water, boom, coffee!

That went on for a little more than a week before they asked me to just leave the coffee to the coffee drinkers.

I’m reaching out to see if anyone would be up for a random, no-pressure hangout somewhere in this london. Whether it’s grabbing a coffee, visiting a quirky museum, exploring a market, or just having a good chat by the Thames I’m open to whatever feels spontaneous and fun.

A little about me: I’m 22m, love photography and history and i am a gamer too,I enjoy exploring new places ie visiting museums, parks etc, yapping about conspiracy theories or literally anything from cars to infinity and learning from one another. I thought it would be exciting to meet someone new in a casual, friendly way.

No expectations — just two people meeting and seeing where a good conversation and a random plan can take us.

If you’re interested, feel free to DM me!

Before COVID turned the world upside down, Friday nights were sacred. It wasn't just the end of a work week — it was a celebration. Whether it was hitting a bar, late-night  jams, gaming marathons, or just wandering the city with friends, Fridays had a vibe of freedom and possibility.

Somewhere during the lockdowns and endless calls, we lost that magic. Friday evenings blurred into just another night indoors.

Trying to change that now.
30M, looking for techies who want to bring back the Friday evening spirit.
Think casual meetups, coffees, co-op gaming, maybe even doing nothing and chilling— anything to make Fridays feel like Fridays again.

If you're in, let's connect. Would like to wind down with some good laugh at the end of the week

I've used smaller moka pots before, and they always worked more or less flawlessly. I made a couple of pots this morning and when I went to disassemble the Venus, I noticed that there was a puddle of water in the boiler. The obvious explanation is that I didn't leave it on the (gas flame) heat for long enough, but I let it gurgle for quite a while and checked the progress of the coffee under the lid. It definitely seemed ""done"". Should I keep it on the heat until the gurgling completely stops? For minimizing bitterness, several sources recommend removing it from the heat as soon as you hear the gurgling, but in my limited experience so far, that doesn't really seem possible with this model.
